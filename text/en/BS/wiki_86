<text>A stop sign is a traffic sign designed to notify drivers that they must come to a complete stop and make sure the intersection (or railroad crossing) is safely clear of vehicles and pedestrians before continuing past the sign. In many countries, the sign is a red octagon with the word &quot;STOP&quot;, in either English, the national language of that particular country, or both, displayed in white or yellow. The Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals also allows an alternative version: a red circle with a red inverted triangle with either a white or yellow background, and a black or dark blue &quot;STOP&quot;. Some countries may also use other types, such as Japan&#x27;s inverted red triangle stop sign. Particular regulations regarding appearance, installation, and compliance with the signs vary by some jurisdictions.

==Design and configuration==
The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals allows for two types of stop signs as well as several acceptable variants. Sign B2a is a red octagon with a white &#x27; legend. The European Annex to the convention also allows the background to be &quot;light yellow&quot;. Sign B2b is a red circle with a red inverted triangle with either a white or yellow background, and a black or dark blue &#x27; legend. The Convention allows for the word &quot;STOP&quot; to be in either English or the national language of the particular country. The finalized version by the United Nations Economic and Social Council&#x27;s Conference on Road Traffic in 1968 (and in force in 1978) proposed standard stop sign diameters of 600, 900 or 1200 mm (24, 36 or 48 inches).

The United Kingdom and New Zealand stop signs are 750, 900 or 1200 mm (about 30, 36 or 48 inches), according to sign location and traffic speeds.

In the United States, stop signs are across opposite flats of the red octagon, with a -inch (2 cm) white border. The white uppercase legend is tall. Larger signs of with legend and border are used on multi-lane expressways. Regulatory provisions exist for extra-large signs with legend and -inch border for use where sign visibility or reaction distance are limited, and the smallest permissible stop sign size for general usage is with an legend and -inch (1.5 cm) border. The metric units specified in the US regulatory manuals are rounded approximations of US customary units, not exact conversions. The field, legend, and border are all retroreflective.

Some modern stop signs have flashing LEDs around the perimeter, which has been shown to substantially reduce crashes.

==History==
The first stop sign was created in 1914 by Detroit police sergeant Harold &quot;Harry&quot; Jackson, who was working as a traffic guard at a busy city intersection. One of the cross streets had a particularly low-visibility turn entering the intersection, almost always forcing Sgt. Jackson to slow down and hold back the traffic entering from that street. Looking for ways to make his job easier, he took a rectangular piece of plywood, cut off the corners to give it a distinct shape, wrote &quot;STOP&quot; over the center and placed facing the street. He noticed that his innovation improved the overall traffic flow through the intersection. After he shared his experience with fellow officers at a meeting, the practice started to spread across the city intersections.
The next year, 1915, stop signs were adopted across Michigan. The first ones had black lettering on a white background and were , somewhat smaller than the current sign. As stop signs became more widespread, a rural-dominated committee supported by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) met in 1922 to standardize them and selected the octagonal shape that has been used in the United States ever since. The unique eight-sided shape of the sign allows drivers facing the back of the sign to identify that oncoming drivers have a stop sign and prevent confusion with other traffic signs. Another consideration of the AASHO was visibility and driver literacy, as summarized in subsequent State Highway Commission reports in the states of the U.S., was that the goal for signs &quot;standardized throughout the Union&quot; was that &quot;The shape of the sign will indicate what it will mean. This has been worked up very carefully by the best-qualified men in the country and men who have made a thorough study of this question. It has been found that so many people have trouble in reading the sign that the shape of the sign is very much more important than the reading matter on it.&quot;

The octagon was also chosen so that it could be identified easily at night since the original signs were not reflective. The more urban-oriented National Conference on Street and Highway Safety (NCSHS) advocated a smaller red-on-yellow stop sign. These two organizations eventually merged to form the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, which in 1935 published the first Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (MUTCD) detailing the stop sign&#x27;s specifications.

The MUTCD&#x27;s stop sign specifications were altered eight times between 1935 and 1971. From 1924 to 1954, stop signs bore a red or black legend on a yellow field. Yellow was chosen because fade-resistant red materials were not available. Retro-reflective or self-lit signs were permitted in the 1935 MUTCD; retro-reflective ones were first required by the 1948 edition of the MUTCD, which also called for a height from the road crown to the bottom of the stop sign. The 1954 MUTCD newly specified a white legend on a red field, and increased the mount height specification to 5 feet in rural areas. Red traffic lights signify &quot;stop&quot;, so the new specification unified red as a stop signal whether given by a sign or a light. The current mounting height of was first specified in 1971. 

===US mandate, international adoption===
The MUTCD stop sign was already widely deployed in the United States when the use of other types of stop signs was eliminated in 1966. In 1968, this sign was adopted by the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals as part of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe&#x27;s effort to standardize road travel across borders. The Convention specifies that be written in English or the national language, and also allows a circular sign with red legend. Forty European countries are party to the convention.

==Stop signs around the world==
The red octagonal field with white English-language &#x27; legend is the most common stop sign used around the world, but it is not universal; Japan uses an inverted solid red triangle, for example, and Zimbabwe until 2016 used a disc bearing a black cross. Moreover, there are many variants of the red-and-white octagonal sign. Although all English-speaking and many other countries use the word &#x27; on stop signs, some jurisdictions use an equivalent word in their primary language instead, or in addition. Also, several languages borrowed the English word &quot;stop&quot; a long time ago, such as French, and therefore do not consider it to be a foreign word any more.
The use of native languages is common on U.S. native reservations, especially those promoting language revitalization efforts, for example, and Israel uses no word, but rather a pictogram of a hand in a palm-forward &quot;stop&quot; gesture.

===Asia===

Countries in Asia generally use a native word, often in a non-Latin script. The sign&#x27;s shape varies by location, with places such as South Korea, Hong Kong, or Taiwan using the standard octagon shape, with Japan using a triangle.

===Europe===
Countries in Europe generally have stop signs with the text , regardless of local language. There were some objections to this when introduced around the 1970s, but now this is accepted. Turkey (and the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;)&quot; is a notable exception to this, instead using the Turkish word for stop: &quot;dur&quot;.

===Latin America===

In Spanish and Portuguese-speaking Caribbean and South American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and Venezuela), signs bear the legend &#x27; (&quot;stop&quot; in Portuguese and Spanish). Mexico and Central American countries bear the legend &#x27; (&quot;halt&quot;) instead.

===Canada===

In the Canadian province of Quebec, modern signs read either &#x27; or &#x27;. As of 1987, Quebec removed the English &quot;stop&quot; from its road signs in favor of &quot;arrêt&quot;. Both &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;arrêt&quot; are considered valid French words, with France actually using the word &quot;STOP&quot; on its stop signs, and the Office québécois de la langue française (OQLF) notes that the use of &quot;stop&quot; on stop signs is attested in French since 1927. At the time of the debates surrounding the adoption of the Charter of the French Language (&quot;Bill 101&quot;) in 1977, the usage of &quot;stop&quot; was considered to be English and therefore controversial; some signs were occasionally vandalized with red spray paint to turn the word &#x27; into &quot;101&quot;. However, it was later officially determined by the OQLF that &quot;stop&quot; is a valid French word in this context, and the older dual &#x27; / &#x27; usage is therefore considered redundant and therefore deprecated (&quot;à éviter&quot;). Newly installed signs thus use only one word, more commonly only &#x27; in Québec, while &#x27; is seen in predominantly English-speaking areas. The latter version of stop signs has been disagreed upon by some Quebec residents. Bilingual signs with &#x27; are still placed in areas of Alberta, New Brunswick and Manitoba; the Acadian regions of Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island; on federal property in the National Capital Region; and at all border crossings of the Canada–United States border. On First Nations or Inuit territories, stop signs sometimes use the local aboriginal language in addition or instead of English, French, or both, such as Inuktitut &#x27;. All other English-speaking areas of Canada use &#x27;.

The following are some older stop sign designs, used before the Vienna Road Traffic Convention standardized the design:
==Application==
The use of stop signs varies by country. North America and South Africa use all-way stops in some intersections unlike in some countries where they are legally prohibited. In a majority of Central Asian countries, as well as Cuba in North America, junctions without traffic lights or roundabouts are controlled by stop signs on minor roads and by white, yellow and black priority diamond signs on the major road. In Europe and Australia, stop signs are restricted to places where coming to a dead stop is deemed necessary because of severely limited sight lines. At the vast majority of minor intersections in these countries give way signs or equivalent road markings are used, or the intersections are no-priority; roundabouts also work on the give way (rather than stop) principle.

===North America===
Stop signs are often used in North America to control conflicting traffic movements at intersections that are deemed not busy enough to justify the installation of a traffic signal or roundabout. In the United States, the stop sign is not intended as a traffic calming device, but is meant to be installed mainly for safety or to assign right-of-way. Stop signs may be erected on all intersecting roads, resulting in an all-way stop. Some research has concluded that stop signs do not offer measurable safety benefits over the Yield approach. Other research has concluded that multiway stop signs do not effectively control traffic speeds, and can give rise to negative effects including increased traffic noise and pollution from braking and accelerating vehicles, enforcement problems, and reduced sign compliance.

====On school buses====
A stop sign on a pivoting arm is required equipment on North American school buses. The sign normally stows flat on the left side of the bus, and is deployed by the driver when opening the door for picking up or dropping off passengers. Some buses have two such stop arms, one near the front facing forwards, and one near the rear facing backwards. The stop sign is retroreflective and equipped either with red blinking lights above and below the legend or with a legend that is illuminated by LEDs. Unlike a normal stop sign, this sign indicates a two-way absolute stop, requiring other vehicles travelling in both directions to remain stopped until the sign is retracted.

===Europe===
In Europe, stop signs are generally placed at sites where visibility is severely restricted, or where a high crash rate has been noted. In some European countries, stop signs are placed at level crossings to mark the stop line. For most situations, Europe uses the give way sign instead. All-way stops, which are common in North America, are exceedingly rare in Europe. Comparatively, roundabouts and priority to the right intersections are more common.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, stop signs may only be placed at junctions with tramways or sites with severely restricted visibility. Until 2016, each stop sign had to be individually approved by the Secretary of State for Transport. This requirement was removed by the 2016 amendments to the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions; the responsibility for approving stop signs now lies with local authorities.

Section 79 of the Highways Act 1980 enables the government to improve visibility at junctions, as by removing or shortening walls or hedges. The Department for Transport considers improving visibility to be preferable to installing a stop sign. The former UK practice of using &quot;Halt&quot; or &quot;Slow&quot; at Major Road Ahead signs was discontinued in 1965 at the recommendation of the Worboys Committee. Instead of replacing all the old signs with the new Vienna Convention sign, the sign became the standard one at UK priority junctions.

==Compliance requirements==
Laws and regulations regarding how drivers must comply with a stop sign vary by jurisdiction. In the United States and Canada, these rules are set and enforced at the state or provincial level. At a junction where two or more traffic directions are controlled by stop signs, US and Canada practice generally has the driver who arrives and stops first continue first. If two or three drivers in different directions stop simultaneously at a junction controlled by stop signs, generally the drivers on the left must yield the right-of-way to the driver on the far right.

In all countries, the driver must come to a &quot;complete&quot; stop before passing a stop sign, even if no other vehicle or pedestrian is visible. If a stop line is marked on the pavement, drivers must stop before crossing the line. Slowing but not completely stopping is called a &quot;rolling stop&quot;, sometimes nicknamed after a city or region where it is considered endemic (e.g., &quot;Rhode Island roll&quot; or &quot;California stop&quot;) – slowing down significantly but not stopping completely at the sign. This partial stop is not acceptable to most law enforcement officials, and can result in a traffic citation. However, enforcement of this rule varies widely among countries. The automobile manufacturer Tesla removed a &quot;rolling stop&quot; feature from its self-driving software after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration complained the practice is unsafe and illegal everywhere in the United States.

In some countries such as Czechia and Russia, stopping is required only at a place where a driver has a sufficient view into the intersection, not at the border of the intersection (where a &quot;STOP&quot; line is not present). Therefore, if multiple drivers come from the same direction and all of them stop at appropriate place, they can continue without stopping again.

===Bicyclists===

In some jurisdictions, such as the U.S. state of Idaho, the traffic code allows for bicyclists approaching a stop sign to slow down and yield to conflicting traffic, then proceed without stopping unless safety requires a full stop. The Idaho law has been in effect since 1982 and has not been shown to be detrimental to safety. Since 2017, more states have implemented changes to the law similar to Idaho&#x27;s: Delaware (2017), Oregon (2020), Washington (2020), Utah (2021) and North Dakota (2021). Cyclist advocacy groups have sought similar &quot;Idaho stop&quot; laws for other jurisdictions in the United States.

==Disadvantages==
Stop sign placement can pose difficulties and hazards in applications where cross traffic is not controlled by a sign or light. Relatively long distance between the stop sign and the crossroad facilitates accurate perception of the speed of approaching cross traffic, but lengthens the time and distance required to enter and clear the junction. Relatively short distance between the stop sign and the crossroad shortens the time required for safe passage through the intersection, but degrades the ability of the stopped driver to accurately perceive the speed of approaching cross traffic. Specifically, drivers approaching an intersection from beyond the subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT) limit may be perceived by a stopped driver as standing still rather than approaching, which means the stopped driver may not make an accurate decision as to whether it is safe to proceed past the stop sign. Whether the distance between the stop sign and the crossroad is officially short or is shortened by drivers creeping past the stop line, they can lose the visual acuity of lateral motion, leaving them to rely on the SAVT. This can make it challenging to accurately estimate the movement of approaching cross traffic. According to recent game-theoretical analysis, at intersections where all directions face stop signs, drivers have strong incentives to run the stop sign. A better solution is to randomly remove one stop sign from all directions, which could lead to significant efficiency gains while ensuring safe traffic.

<text>Sunday Creek is a tributary of the Hocking River, 27.2 miles (43.8 km) long, in southeastern Ohio in the United States. Via the Hocking and Ohio Rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining 139 square miles (360 km2) in a mainly rural area of the Allegheny Plateau region. Its name is locally said to derive from early white settlers who in 1802 reached the creek on a Sunday, and so named it after the day of their discovery. (also see nearby Monday Creek.)

Sunday Creek rises in southeastern Perry County and flows generally southwardly into northern Athens County, passing through the communities of Rendville, Corning, Glouster, Trimble, Jacksonville, and Millfield (site of the 1930 Millfield Mine disaster), to Chauncey, where it flows into the Hocking River. In Athens County north of Glouster it collects the East Branch Sunday Creek, 15.5 miles (25 km) long, which rises in Perry County and passes through Morgan County. Tom Jenkins Dam, constructed on the East Branch in Athens County in 1950 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, forms Burr Oak Lake, the site of Burr Oak State Park. In Glouster, Sunday Creek collects the West Branch Sunday Creek, 14 miles (22.5 km) long, which rises in Perry County and flows generally southwardly.

Other significant Tributaries include Greens Run, Mud Fork, and Johnson Run, all perennial streams draining the area to the west of the creek.
A predominant land use in the watershed of Sunday Creek has historically been coal mining, with both underground and surface mines in the area. A 1997 study by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency identified the lowermost thirteen miles of Sunday Creek as having been &quot;irretrievably damaged to the extent that no appreciable aquatic life can be supported&quot; due to the creek&#x27;s low pH, caused by acid mine drainage. The lower areas of the creek are generally colored orange from the effects of acid-mine drainage during times of low water.

, an organization called the Sunday Creek Watershed Group operates with the intention of addressing water quality and ecosystem-related matters in the watershed. It is sponsored by Rural Action, a non-profit organization in southeastern Ohio.

True Pigments is a social enterprise founded in 2019 as part of Rural Action, in collaboration with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and Ohio University. The initiative aims to develop innovative technologies that transform acid mine drainage (AMD) from the Truetown Mine Disaster into marketable pigments. These pigments are intended for production and sale in the wholesale market, contributing to environmental sustainability by addressing water pollution issues caused by AMD.

<text>Earl of Portmore was a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1703 for the Scottish military commander David Colyear, 1st Lord Portmore. He had already been created Lord Portmore in 1699 and was made Lord Colyear and Viscount of Milsington at the same time as he was granted the earldom, also in the Peerage of Scotland. He was the son of Alexander Colyear, who had been created a Baronet, of Holland, in the Baronetage of England on 20 February 1677. Lord Portmore married Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, a former mistress of James II. He was succeeded by his only surviving son, the second Earl. He represented Wycombe and Andover in Parliament. His grandson, the fourth Earl (who succeeded his father), sat as Member of Parliament for Boston. The fourth Earl died without surviving male issue in 1835 when the titles became extinct.

<text>The Teays River 
(pronounced taze) was a major preglacial river that drained much of the present Ohio River watershed, but took a more northerly downstream course. Traces of the Teays across northern Ohio and Indiana are represented by a network of river valleys. The largest still existing contributor to the former Teays River is the Kanawha River in West Virginia, which is itself an extension of the New River.
The name &quot;Teays,&quot; from the much smaller Teays Valley still extant above the surface, has been associated with the river and the remainder of its related buried valley since 1910. The more appropriate name would be the Ancestral Kanawha Valley. The term Teays is used when discussing the buried portion of the Ancestral Kanawha River.
The Teays was comparable in size to the Ohio River. The River&#x27;s headwaters were near Blowing Rock, North Carolina; it then flowed through Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. (Hansen, 1995). The largest tributary to the Teays River was the Old Kentucky River (Teller 1991), which extended from southern Kentucky through Frankfort and subsequently flowed northeast, meeting other tributaries and eventually joining the Teays.

==Creation==
Scattered glacial erratics in northeastern Kentucky and southern Ohio are pre-Kansan in age. Only the Nebraskan is recognized as earlier than Kansan; these have been designated as remnants of deposits left by the Nebraskan glacier. The ice sheet overrode the preglacial Teays creating ponds or glacial lakes. The back up of water diverted the upper basin over the surrounding divides into the preglacial Ohio River. Thus the ‘deep stage’ more likely is post-Nebraskan and pre-Kansan in age rather than preglacial. With the withdrawal of the Nebraskan glacier, which caused integration of the upper Kanawha (Teays) with the preglacial Ohio, a vastly shortened, unnamed descendant of the Teays apparently headed somewhere in west-central Ohio and cut the ‘deep stage’ across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois during the long Aftonian interglacial stage, which followed.

If the sequence of bedrock formations of northern Indiana were exposed, the extensive cliffs along the ‘deep stage’ of the Teays and its tributaries would provide a clearer understanding of the stratigraphy of northern Indiana. The entire Silurian section below the Liston Creek limestone and a few feet of the upper Ordovician probably would be visible in the vicinity of La Fontaine.
In Wabash County the part of the Teays Valley above the ‘deep stage’ consists of broad terraces at an altitude of about . From this terrace level the bedrock rises gradually to the on the Lexington pene-plain surface. These terraces probably correspond in age to an erosional surface in the unglaciated areas known as the Parker strath, which was the result an erosion cycle that ended before the Kansan phase of the pre-Illinoian glaciation. More recent correlation places its age as pre-Nebraskan. The Parker strath probably represents an erosional level existent at the beginning of the Pleistocene before the rejuvenation associated with, and following, the Nebraskan glaciation. The general appearance and width of the strath terrace along the Teays Valley in Indiana indicates that it represents only a slight rejuvenation following the Lexington cycle.

In Virginia and West Virginia, the Teays River flowed in the valleys of the modern New River and Kanawha River (Hansen, 1995). The river then flowed west to Scioto County, Ohio, and to Ross County, Ohio, near Chillicothe. The valley then disappears under glacial sediments but can be tracked using water well yields and other means (Hansen, 1995). A total of seven tills have been identified within the Teays River Valley (Andrews, 2004). In portions of Ohio, the buried valley is up to wide and lies beneath of glacial sediments (Hansen, 1995).

==Course==
The Teays River was a north- and northwest-flowing river existing before the Pleistocene Ice Ages – before 2.5 million years ago. The Teays flowed through southwest West Virginia, between Kentucky and Ohio, and northwest across Ohio (see illustration). The Teays then flowed under what is present-day Lafayette, Indiana, and just north of Champaign, Illinois, and likely was coincident with the lower present-day Illinois River.

The Teays River was dissected and largely wiped away by advancing glaciers and their meltwater. These glaciers were the massive continental ice sheets that began to cover large parts of Ohio and other states downstream (west) of Ohio between 2.5 and 3 million years ago. Their presence caused lakes (Lake Tight, Lake Monongahela, etc.) to form along the Teays and associated rivers. Overflow of these lakes into nearby, lower valleys caused large floods and new rivers to form. These new rivers – formed about 2 million years ago – included the present-day Ohio and Scioto Rivers, which are associated with the most direct evidence of the Teays.

===West Virginia===
The Teays River was the main stream of a preglacial river system. Its headwaters was near the eastern escarpment of the Blue Ridge, at the edge of the Piedmont Plateau in North Carolina and Virginia.
The New River, the southernmost headwater of the Teays River, arises in Watauga County, North Carolina, in the Blue Ridge. This area is northeast of Asheville. It flows northeasterly direction for some distance and after making a right-angled bend, it trends northward until it makes a 90° turn to the west and joins the Gauley River. Here, it takes a new name as the Kanawha River. This continues to the northwest to Charleston. As New River, it was joined by the Greenbrier and Bluestone rivers. At Charleston, the Kanawha is joined by the Elk River.
In its course, the Teays River cut across the folded Appalachians, a remarkable feature. The valley varies in width, from , an average of . A mile wide valley can be observed without a stream from St. Albans to Huntington. No doubt, a large stream once occupied this abandoned valley. Approaching Huntington, the Guyandotte River joins the general path of the ancient river beginning at Barboursville and follows it north until the former river veers west over the south hills of Huntington and joins the Ohio River Valley heading west towards Kentucky. The Ohio River follows the Teays path until leaving the Ohio River in the north end of Catlettsburg where it veers away just south of Ashland to Wheelersburg. The Ohio River has a floor of the original valley as shown by the silted flats south of Ashland and the terraces between Franklin Furnace and Wheelersburg.
At Wheelersburg, the Teays River flowed northward past Minford, Stockdale and Beaver, to Waverly, through a high-level, broad, well-defined open valley.

===Ohio===
The Teays system in Ohio is known as the Parker Strath. The Teays River extended across Ohio in a northwesterly direction from Huntington, West Virginia. It splits away from the Ohio River near Sciotodale/Wheelersburg and goes north and west through Minford, Stockdale, and Beaver before merging with the Scioto River valley near Waverly/Piketon. This is clearly visible on aerial and satellite imagery. However, its floor exists as broad upland flats, near Omega and Higby. The Scioto River has eroded and partially destroyed the Teays Valley from Waverly to Richmond Dale. It then continues northward to Chillicothe, where it disappears under a layering of Wisconsin glacial drift. Surveying under the glacial drift has revealed that it continues to the border of Indiana, near Grand Lake St. Marys. From Chillicothe, the Teays Valley can be traced in a northwesterly direction past Andersonville, crossing the southwestern part of Pickaway County, past Atlanta. From there, it crosses the northeast corner of Fayette County near Pancoastburg (former Waterloo), extending in a northwesterly direction past London in Madison County, to South Vienna in Clark County. Here the Teays was joined by the Groveport River, which drained central Ohio. From South Vienna, the Teays River continues in a westerly direction, to a point near Springfield, in Clark County, and thence northwestward past Boulusville and St. Paris in Champaign County, and Sidney, Anna and Botkins, in Shelby County, to the southeastern part of Washington Township in Auglaize County, where it was joined from the north by a tributary, Wapakoneta Creek. The Teays continued its course westward past the village of Mercer to Rockford. Continuing west to the Ohio-Indiana state line in Mercer County.

===Indiana===
The Teays Valley enters Indiana in Jay County and trends west. It turns to the northwest west of La Fontaine crossing Miami County south of the Wabash River. Reaching under Tippecanoe County, it continues west through southern Benton County and into Illinois. (Fidlar, 1948, pp. 12–15).

===Illinois===
In Illinois, the valley is called the Mahomet.(Horberg, 1945, pp. 349–350). It trends westerly across the state, into the bedrock valley of the Illinois River.

==Entrenched or ‘deep stage’==
The ‘deep stage’ is used to describe the portion of the Teays Valley and other proglacial valleys carved into bedrock in the Great Lakes region. This includes Ohio Valley, near Madison, Indiana, before the Pleistocene; the Wabash Valley; and the Mississippi Valley. The floor of the Teays Valley in West Virginia is above the entrenched Kanawha and Ohio valley floors, and its bedrock floor is at least above them. The ‘deep stage’ apparently was cut mainly after the diversion of the upper Kanawha (Teays) drainage to the Ohio River (Stout, Ver Steeg, and Lamb, 1943, pp. 78–79).
The lowest bedrock altitude obtained along the course of the Teays Valley across Wabash County was above sea level in the vicinity of La Fontaine. The average gradient of the Mahomet Valley above Beardstown, Illinois, is about 7 inches per mile (11.1 cm per kilometer). The altitude of the valley floor where it occurs beneath the present floodplain of the Wabash River should be about .
The profile of the Teays is a gorge-like valley entrenched within a broad, old age valley. Steep walls high can be recognized along the buried trench. The inner valley has been called the ‘deep stage’ and is interglacial in age.

==Tributaries==
===Ohio valleys===
In the unglaciated area of southern Ohio, tributaries reflect the adjacent hills, which are considerably reduced: low gradients, broad valleys for the size of the modern streams, and patterns, all features of maturity. The largest of the tributaries in Ohio are the Marietta River, Hamden Creek, Albany River, Barlow Creek, Portsmouth River, Logan River, Bremen Creek, Putnam Creek, Cambridge River, Groveport River, Mechanicsburg Creek, and Wapakoneta Creek. The Cincinnati River flows northeastward from the southwest corner of Ohio to Dayton, to join the Teays River. At the time a divide existed between the preglacial Teays and the Miami watershed. Well records do not indicate a broad depression, which widens northward and is of sufficient size to have accommodated so large a stream as the Cincinnati River.

=== Preglacial Eel Valley ===
The Eel Valley in Wabash County, Indiana, follows a preglacial tributary of the Teays.(Horberg, 1945, p. 357). It too has a ‘deep stage’. At its junction with the Teays Valley it is just under above sea level. The tributary does not rise above through its length in Wabash County.

===Illinois valleys===
A tributary from the north enters the Mahomet Valley near Paxton, and important tributaries from the south, north of Danville, and in western Logan and Menard counties.

==Demise==
The Kanawha (Teays) was forced across a major divide when the return of the Laurentian ice sheet dammed the northward flow of the river. The diversion occurred during the Nebraskan or older pre-Illinoian glaciation. This is based on an analysis of the drift found in the valley from the Kansan or late pre-Illinoian age.

==Present-day remnants==
Visual remains of the Teays River today include large valleys containing only small streams (such as the mile-wide valley from Huntington to St. Albans in West Virginia and the valley extending north from Wheelersburg in Ohio). These valleys can be seen on aerial and satellite images. However, short segments of some such valleys are still occupied by the Ohio and Scioto Rivers. The Scioto flows through the valley in the opposite direction (south) to that taken by the Teays (north).

The Teays River was dissected and largely wiped away by advancing glaciers and their meltwater. These glaciers were the massive continental ice sheets that began to cover large parts of Ohio and other states downstream (west) of Ohio between 2.5 and 3 million years ago. Their presence caused lakes (Lake Tight, Lake Monongahela, etc.) to form along the Teays and associated rivers. Overflow of these lakes into nearby, lower valleys caused large floods and new rivers to form. These new rivers – formed about 2 million years ago – included the present-day Ohio and Scioto Rivers, which are associated with the most direct evidence of the Teays.

The present Ohio-Mississippi river system contains some distinctive relict fish populations descended from Jurassic Period fishes of the Teays, such as the primitive bowfin (&quot;Amia calva&quot;) and various gars (&quot;Lepisosteus&quot; spp).

==Discovery==
The Teays River was discovered and named for the village of Teays, West Virginia, by geologist William G. Tight (1865–1910). The small community of Teays is in the &quot;riverless&quot; Teays Valley that used to be the bottom of the Teays River.

In 1886, Gerard Fowke recognized that the gorge west of Chillicothe, Ohio, was larger than Paint Creek would have created. He claimed that a large river would have had to exist to create the wide and deep valley. Conventional geologists did not support his claim.
In 1903 William G. Tight, a professor at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, saw the same type of valley and small stream running from Charleston to the Ohio River. It had only a minor water course beyond St. Albans, West Virginia. Here, the Kanawha River turns north. Professor Tight sought in vain to persuade the geological community that this valley once carried a mighty river that continued across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois through a valley now deeply buried under glacial deposits. He called it the Teays (pronounced taze) River, for a village in West Virginia.

==Namesakes==
Teays Valley, West Virginia, and Ashville, Ohio&#x27;s Teays Valley Local School District are named after the former river.

<doc id="557655" wikidata="Q336227" url="?curid=557655" title="Charles Cathcart, 2nd Earl Cathcart">
<text>General Charles Murray Cathcart, 2nd Earl Cathcart (21 December 1783 – 16 July 1859), styled Lord Greenock between 1814 and 1843, was a British Army general who became Governor General of the Province of Canada (26 November 1845 – 30 January 1847). He was a keen amateur geologist, with enough recognition to warrant being made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

==Early life==
Cathcart was born at Walton, Essex, on 21 December 1783, the eldest surviving son of William Cathcart, 10th Lord Cathcart (later the 1st Earl Cathcart).

==Career==
Cathcart entered the army as a cornet in the 2nd Regiment of Life Guards on 2 March 1800. He served on the staff of Sir James Craig in Naples and Sicily. He became heir apparent to the lordship of Cathcart in 1804, after his brother William Cathcart, Master of Cathcart died while commanding a Royal Navy vessel in the West Indies. After his father was elevated to an earldom in 1814 he became known by the courtesy title Lord Greenock.

Cathcart saw service on the ill-fated Walcheren Expedition in 1809 and at the siege of Flushing, after which for some time he was disabled by the injurious effects of the pestilence which cut off so many thousands of his companions. Becoming lieutenant colonel on 30 August 1810, he embarked for the Peninsula, where he was present at the Battle of Barrosa, for which he received a gold medal on 6 April 1812, at the Battle of Salamanca, and the Battle of Vitoria, during which he served as assistant quartermaster-general.

He was next sent to assist Sir Thomas Graham in Holland as the head of the quartermaster-general&#x27;s staff and was present at the ill-fated Siege of Bergen op Zoom in March 1814. Thereafter he was present at the Battle of Waterloo, where he had three horses shot from under him. He was awarded the Russian Order of St. Vladimir, the Dutch Military William Order, and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). In 1823, he was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the royal staff corps at Hythe.

In 1830 he moved to Edinburgh where lived at &quot;Whitehouse villa&quot; on Bruntsfield Links. He became involved in the proceedings of the Highland Society, became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and where he announced the discovery of a new mineral, a sulphide of cadmium, which was found in excavating the Bishopton tunnel near Port Glasgow and which is now known as Greenockite. On 17 February 1837 he was made Commander-in-Chief, Scotland and Governor of Edinburgh Castle. On 17 June 1838, on the death of his father, he became second earl and eleventh baron Cathcart. On 16 March 1846 he was appointed commander-in-chief in British North America from 16 March 1846 and in 1850 he was appointed to the command of the Northern and Midland District, and in 1855 he retired.

==Family==
On 30 September 1818 he married Henrietta Mather, daughter of Thomas Mather in France. The couple remarried at Portsea, England, 12 February 1819. Lady Cathcart accompanied her husband, and their daughters, to Canada in June, 1845. Lady Cathcart presented colours to one of the militia regiments in Montreal. The family returned to England in May, 1847. His daughter Elizabeth married General Sir John Douglas.

Cathcart died at St. Leonard&#x27;s-on-Sea on 16 July 1859. His wife died on 24 June 1872.

==Publications==
He was the author of two papers in the &quot;Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&quot; in 1836, &quot;On the Phenomena in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh of the Igneous Rocks in their relation to the Secondary Strata,&quot; and &quot;The Coal Formation of the Scottish Lowlands.&quot;

<text>Trial division is the most laborious but easiest to understand of the integer factorization algorithms. The essential idea behind trial division tests to see if an integer , the integer to be factored, can be divided by each number in turn that is less than or equal to the square root of . 

For example, to find the prime factors of , one can try to divide by successive primes: first, ; next, neither nor evenly divides ; finally, , and is itself prime. So .

Trial division was first described by Fibonacci in his book &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; (1202).

== Method ==
Given an integer &quot;n&quot; (&quot;n&quot; refers to &quot;the integer to be factored&quot;), the trial division consists of systematically testing whether &quot;n&quot; is divisible by any smaller number. Clearly, it is only worthwhile to test candidate factors less than &quot;n&quot;, and in order from two upwards because an arbitrary &quot;n&quot; is more likely to be divisible by two than by three, and so on. With this ordering, there is no point in testing for divisibility by four if the number has already been determined not divisible by two, and so on for three and any multiple of three, etc. Therefore, the effort can be reduced by selecting only prime numbers as candidate factors. Furthermore, the trial factors need go no further than formula_1 because, if &quot;n&quot; is divisible by some number &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;n = p × q&quot; and if &quot;q&quot; were smaller than &quot;p&quot;, &quot;n&quot; would have been detected earlier as being divisible by &quot;q&quot; or by a prime factor of &quot;q&quot;.

A definite bound on the prime factors is possible. Suppose is the &#x27;th prime, so that &quot;P&quot;1 = 2, &quot;P&quot;2 = 3, &quot;P&quot;3 = 5, etc. Then the last prime number worth testing as a possible factor of &quot;n&quot; is where ; equality here would mean that is a factor. Thus, testing with 2, 3, and 5 suffices up to &quot;n&quot; = 48 not just 25 because the square of the next prime is 49, and below &quot;n&quot; = 25 just 2 and 3 are sufficient. Should the square root of &quot;n&quot; be an integer, then it is a factor and &quot;n&quot; is a perfect square.

The trial division algorithm in pseudocode:

 algorithm trial-division is
 input: Integer &quot;n&quot; to be factored
 output: List &quot;F&quot; of prime factors of &quot;n&quot;
 &quot;P&quot; ← set of all primes ≤ formula_2
 &quot;F&quot; ← empty list of factors
 for each prime &quot;p&quot; in &quot;P&quot; do
 while &quot;n&quot; mod &quot;p&quot; is 0
 Add factor &quot;p&quot; to list &quot;F&quot;
 &quot;n&quot; ← &quot;n&quot;/&quot;p&quot;
 if &quot;F&quot; is empty &quot;(Original n is prime?)&quot;
 Add factor &quot;n&quot; to list &quot;F&quot;

Determining the primes less than or equal to formula_2 is not a trivial task as &quot;n&quot; gets larger, so the simplest computer programs to factor a number just try successive integers, prime and composite, from 2 to formula_2 as possible factors.

==Speed==
In the worst case, trial division is a laborious algorithm. For a base-2 &quot;n&quot; digit number &quot;a&quot;, if it starts from two and works up only to the square root of &quot;a&quot;, the algorithm requires

:formula_5

trial divisions, where formula_6 denotes the prime-counting function, the number of primes less than &quot;x&quot;. This does not take into account the overhead of primality testing to obtain the prime numbers as candidate factors. A useful table need not be large: P(3512) = 32749, the last prime that fits into a sixteen-bit signed integer and P(6542) = 65521 for unsigned sixteen-bit integers. That would suffice to test primality for numbers up to 655372 = 4,295,098,369. Preparing such a table (usually via the Sieve of Eratosthenes) would only be worthwhile if many numbers were to be tested. If instead a variant is used without primality testing, but simply dividing by every odd number less than the square root the base-2 &quot;n&quot; digit number &quot;a&quot;, prime or not, it can take up to about:

:formula_7

In both cases, the required time grows exponentially with the digits of the number.

Even so, this is a quite satisfactory method, considering that even the best-known algorithms have exponential time growth. For &quot;a&quot; chosen uniformly at random from integers of a given length, there is a 50% chance that 2 is a factor of &quot;a&quot; and a 33% chance that 3 is a factor of &quot;a&quot;, and so on. It can be shown that 88% of all positive integers have a factor under 100 and that 92% have a factor under 1000. Thus, when confronted by an arbitrary large &quot;a&quot;, it is worthwhile to check for divisibility by the small primes, since for formula_8, in base-2 formula_9.

However, many-digit numbers that do not have factors in the small primes can require days or months to factor with the trial division. In such cases other methods are used such as the quadratic sieve and the general number field sieve (GNFS). Because these methods also have superpolynomial time growth a practical limit of &quot;n&quot; digits is reached very quickly. For this reason, in public key cryptography, values for &quot;a&quot; are chosen to have large prime factors of similar size so that they cannot be factored by any publicly known method in a useful time period on any available computer system or computer cluster such as supercomputers and computer grids. The largest cryptography-grade number that has been factored is RSA-250, a 250-digit number, using the GNFS and resources of several supercomputers. The running time was 2700 core years.

<text>James Pinckney Henderson (March 31, 1808 – June 4, 1858) was an American and Republic of Texas lawyer, politician, and soldier, and the first governor of the State of Texas.

==Early years==
He was born in Lincolnton, North Carolina, on March 31, 1808, to Lawson Henderson and his wife, Elizabeth Carruth Henderson. His birthplace Woodside, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. After graduating from Pleasant Retreat Academy, Henderson enrolled as a law student at the University of North Carolina. Upon his graduation, he studied 18 hours a day to pass his bar examination, and was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar in 1829.

==Military service and move to Texas==
After becoming a lawyer, Henderson served in the North Carolina militia, rising to colonel. In 1835, Colonel Henderson moved to Canton, Mississippi, where he opened a law practice. He enslaved people.

His attention soon turned to Texas&#x27; struggle against Mexico. Henderson began making speeches to raise money and an army to go to the aid of the Texas cause. Henderson and several volunteers traveled to Texas hoping to participate in the fight for independence. By the time the group arrived in June 1836, many major events had already occurred. The Texas Declaration of Independence had already been signed on March 2, and David G. Burnet was elected interim President of the new Republic of Texas on March 10. The Alamo had fallen on March 6, and Sam Houston had been victorious on April 21 at the Battle of San Jacinto. On May 14, 1836, Antonio López de Santa Anna has signed the Treaties of Velasco agreeing to withdraw his troops from Texas. Interim President Burnet commissioned Henderson as a brigadier general in the Texas Army, with orders to return to North Carolina to raise troops to serve in Texas. This Henderson did at his own expense.

==Government service in the Republic==
Sam Houston became President of the Republic of Texas on September 5, 1836, and appointed Henderson the republic&#x27;s attorney general. In December of that same year, Henderson was named by Houston to replace recently deceased Stephen F. Austin as secretary of state for the republic. In early 1837, Houston decreed Henderson as minister from the Republic of Texas to France at the Tuileries Palace and to England at the Court of St. James&#x27;s. During his tenure as minister, he was successful in securing the recognition of the independence of the Republic of Texas and negotiated trade agreements with both countries.

==Governor of Texas, war with Mexico, United States Senator==
In 1840, Henderson returned to Texas and set up a private law practice in San Augustine. He was sent to Washington, DC, in 1844 to work in coordination with Isaac Van Zandt to secure the annexation of Texas to the United States. Although the annexation treaty was signed, it was rejected by the United States Senate; Henderson was recalled to Texas. An annexation treaty approved the United States Senate was finally passed on December 29, 1845.

In preparation for anticipated statehood, the Texas gubernatorial election, 1845, elected Henderson as its first governor. He took office on February 19, 1846. When the Mexican–American War broke out in April of that year, Henderson took a leave of absence as governor to command a Texas volunteer cavalry division. He served with the rank of major general under Zachary Taylor. He returned home to resume his duties as governor but did not run for a second term. He later served in the United States Senate from November 9, 1857, until his death on June 4, 1858.

==Personal life and death==

Henderson met his future wife, Frances Cox, when he represented the Republic of Texas as a minister to France and England. Cox was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and educated in Europe. She was a multilingual literary translator. On October 30, 1839, they were wed at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square. In 1840, the new couple established a residence and law office in San Augustine, Texas. The couple had five children: daughters Martha, Fanny, and Julia lived to adulthood.

Henderson died in Washington, D.C., in 1858 while serving as a senator for the State of Texas. He is buried at the Texas State Cemetery. After his death during the Civil War years, his widow and daughters moved to Europe. Martha died at age 18. Fanny married into the Austrian aristocracy. Julia married an American sugar plantation owner. Frances Cox Henderson died in 1897 and is buried at Rosedale Cemetery in New Jersey, where she lived with daughter Julia and son-in-law Edward White Adams.

==Legacy==
Henderson County, which was established in 1846, and the city of Henderson, founded in 1843 in Rusk County, are named in his honor. James Pinckney Henderson Elementary School, in Houston, is named for him.

<text>It is the debut studio album by English rock band Pulp, released on 18 April 1983 by Red Rhino Records.

==Release and aftermath==

&quot;It&quot; was originally released as a limited vinyl mini-LP of 2.000 copies in April 1983. The album&#x27;s odd title is in fact a deliberate pun, as when it added to the name of the band it spells the word &quot;Pulpit&quot;.

The first reissue on CD was by Cherry Red in February 1994 with three bonus tracks (&quot;Looking for Life&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Problem&quot; and &quot;There Was...&quot;). However, this release was soon deleted as Cherry Red did not own the material. Later that year Fire Records made its own re-release in November 1994, but without &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Problem&quot; and &quot;There Was...&quot; as bonus tracks. The album existed in this form for all subsequent releases.

The album was reissued and remastered by Fire Records in 2012 along with Pulp&#x27;s 1987&#x27;s &quot;Freaks&quot; and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Separations&quot;. This re-release took several delays as the first stated release date was 8 August 2011 while the albums finally came out on 13 February 2012. An announcement in the interim stated that the albums would be remastered with new bonus tracks to be added to the track listings as well as new artwork and liner notes from music journalist Everett True.

<doc id="557664" wikidata="Q1206729" url="?curid=557664" title="Heel (professional wrestling)">
<text>In professional wrestling, a heel (also known as a rudo in &quot;lucha libre&quot;) is a wrestler who portrays a villain, &quot;bad guy&quot;, &quot;baddie&quot;, &quot;evil-doer&quot;, or &quot;rulebreaker&quot;, and acts as an antagonist to the faces, who are the heroic protagonist or &quot;good guy&quot; characters. Not everything a heel wrestler does must be villainous: heels need only to be booed or jeered by the audience to be effective characters, although most truly successful heels embrace other aspects of their devious personalities, such as cheating to win or using foreign objects. &quot;The role of a heel is to get &#x27;heat,&#x27; which means spurring the crowd to obstreperous hatred, and generally involves cheating and any other manner of socially unacceptable behavior.&quot;

To gain heat (with boos and jeers from the audience), heels are often portrayed as behaving in an immoral manner by breaking rules or otherwise taking advantage of their opponents outside the bounds of the standards of the match. Others do not (or rarely) break rules, but instead exhibit unlikeable, appalling, and deliberately offensive and demoralizing personality traits such as arrogance, cowardice, or contempt for the audience. Many heels do both, cheating as well as behaving nastily. No matter the type of heel, the most important role is that of the antagonist, as heels exist to provide a foil to the face wrestlers. If a given heel is cheered over the face, a promoter may opt to turn that heel to face or the other way around, or to make the wrestler do something even more despicable to encourage heel heat. Some performers display a mixture of both positive and negative character traits. In wrestling terminology, these characters are referred to as tweeners (short hand for the &quot;in-between&quot; good and evil actions these wrestlers display). WWE has been cited as a company that is doing away with the traditional heel/face format due in part to audiences&#x27; willingness to cheer for heels and boo babyfaces.

In &quot;local&quot; wrestling (e.g., American wrestling) it was common for the faces to be &quot;local&quot; (e.g., Hulk Hogan, John Cena, and Stone Cold Steve Austin) and the heels to be portrayed as &quot;foreign&quot; (e.g., Gunther, Alberto Del Rio, Ivan Koloff, The Iron Sheik, Rusev/Miro, Jinder Mahal, and Muhammad Hassan).

In the world of &quot;lucha libre&quot; wrestling, most &quot;rudos&quot; are generally known for being brawlers and for using physical moves that emphasize brute strength or size, often having outfits akin to demons, devils, or other tricksters. This is contrasted with most heroic &quot;técnicos&quot; that are generally known for using moves requiring technical skill, particularly aerial maneuvers.

== History ==
Common heel behavior includes cheating to win (e.g. using the ropes for leverage while pinning or attacking with a weapon while the referee is looking away), employing dirty tactics such as blatant chokes or raking the eyes, attacking other wrestlers backstage, interfering with other wrestlers&#x27; matches, insulting the fans or city they are in (referred to as &quot;cheap heat&quot;) and acting in a haughty or superior manner.

More theatrical heels would feature dramatic outfits giving off a nasty or otherwise dangerous look, such as wearing corpse paint over their faces, putting on demonic masks, covering themselves in dark leather and the like. Gorgeous George is generally regarded as one of the first to implement a gimmick, let alone a &quot;heel&quot; gimmick, in professional wrestling. Starting in the 1940s, he invented an extravagant, flamboyant &quot;pretty boy&quot; gimmick who wore wavy blonde hair, colorful robes and ritzy outfits, and was accompanied by beautiful valets to the ring for his matches. The crowd widely jeered his persona, and came out to his matches in hopes of seeing him defeated. George relished this attention, and exploded into one of the most famous (and hated) heels not only of his era, but of all time. Another example of a dramatic heel is the wrestler The Undertaker, who, on many occasions throughout his career, has switched between portraying a heel or a face. During his period as the leader of The Ministry of Darkness, he appeared as a priest of the occult in a hooded black robe and literally sat in a throne, often in the shape of the symbol used to represent him.

Occasionally, faces who have recently turned from being heels still exhibit characteristics from their heel persona. This occurs due to fans being entertained by a wrestler despite (or because of) their heel persona, often due to the performer&#x27;s charisma or charm in playing the role. Certain wrestlers such as Eddie Guerrero and Ric Flair gained popularity as faces by using tactics that would typically be associated with heels, while others like Stone Cold Steve Austin, Scott Hall and more recently Becky Lynch displayed heelish behavior during their careers yet got big face reactions, leading them to be marketed as antiheroes.

On other occasions, wrestlers who are positioned as faces receive a negative audience reaction despite their portrayal as heroes. An example is Roman Reigns, who in 2018 was a top face in WWE, but got booed in his matches while his opponents got cheered regardless of their status as face or heel, due to perceived favoritism from WWE executives and a lack of character development. Such characters often (but not always) become nudged into becoming villains over time or retooled to present a different public image, such as The Rock&#x27;s turn from a clean-cut face to self-absorbed narcissist in the Nation of Domination heel stable, or Tetsuya Naito&#x27;s fan rejection of his babyface causing him to drastically form Los Ingobernables de Japon. The term &quot;heel&quot; does not, in itself, describe a typical set of attributes or audience reaction, but simply a wrestler&#x27;s presentation and booking as an antagonist.

Depending on the angle, heels can act cowardly or overpowering to their opponents. For instance, a &quot;closet champion&quot; in particular is a term for a heel in possession of a title belt who consistently dodges top flight competition and attempts to back down from challenges. Examples include Seth Rollins during his first WWE World Heavyweight Championship reign, Charlotte during her Divas/Raw Women&#x27;s Championship reign, the Honky Tonk Man during his long Intercontinental Championship reign, Tommaso Ciampa during his NXT Championship reign and The IIconics during their WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship reign. Brock Lesnar&#x27;s character in WWE had heel aspects, and was well known for failing to regularly defend his title (especially during his first Universal Championship reign), often only performing on pay-per-view events and not on SmackDown or especially Raw as he was only on a part-time appearance contract with WWE. This sort of behavior supports the intended kayfabe opinion that the face (or faces) the heel is feuding with is actually more deserving of the title than the title-holding heel is. Heels may beg for mercy during a beat down at the hands of faces, even if they have delivered similar beat downs with no mercy. Ric Flair in particular has been well known for begging an opponent off, then hitting a low blow on his distracted opponent. Other heels may act overpowering to their opponents to play up the scrappy underdog success story for the face.

<text>In professional wrestling, a face (babyface) is a heroic, &quot;good guy&quot;, &quot;good-doer&quot;, or &quot;fan favorite&quot; wrestler, booked (scripted) by the promotion with the aim of being cheered by fans. They are portrayed as heroes relative to the heel wrestlers, who are analogous to villains. Traditionally, face characters wrestle within the rules and avoid cheating while behaving positively towards the referee and the audience. Such characters are also referred to as blue-eyes in British wrestling and técnicos in &quot;lucha libre&quot;. Not everything a face wrestler does must be heroic: faces need only to be clapped or cheered by the audience to be effective characters. When the magazine &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; went into circulation in the late 1970s, the magazine referred to face wrestlers as &quot;fan favorites&quot; or &quot;scientific wrestlers&quot;, while heels were referred to as simply &quot;rulebreakers&quot;.

The vast majority of wrestling storylines involve pitting faces against heels, although more elaborate set-ups (such as two faces being manipulated by a nefarious outside party into fighting, or simply having a clean sportsmanly contest) often happen as well. In the world of &quot;lucha libre&quot; wrestling, most &quot;técnicos&quot; are generally known for using moves requiring technical skill, particularly aerial maneuvers and wearing outfits using bright colors with positive associations (such as solid white). This is contrasted with most villainous &quot;rudos&quot; who are generally known for being brawlers, using physical moves that emphasize brute strength or size while often having outfits akin to demons or other nasty characters.

== History ==
Traditional faces are classic &quot;good guy&quot; characters who rarely break the rules, follow instructions of those in authority such as the referee, are polite and well-mannered towards the fans and often overcome the rule-breaking actions of their heel opponents to cleanly win matches. While many modern faces still fit this model, other versions of the face character are now also common. A good example would be Stone Cold Steve Austin, who despite playing a heel early on in his career would start to be seen more of an antihero because of his popularity with the fans. While clearly not championing rule following, nor submission to authority, Austin was still regarded as the face in many of his duels such as his rivalry with World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) owner Mr. McMahon.
The portrayal of face wrestlers changed in the 1990s with the birth of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), the start of World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s (WCW) New World Order (nWo) storyline, and the Attitude Era of the WWF. During this time, wrestlers like Stone Cold Steve Austin and Sting used tactics traditionally associated with heels, but remained popular with the fans. Professional wrestling had just come off a huge steroid scandal and was facing poor ratings compared to the 1980s, and as a result, professional wrestling transformed into an edgier, more mature product. In this new era of professional wrestling, the standard face was more profane, violent, and uncontrollable.

In contrast to the emerging new breed of faces, Kurt Angle was introduced to the then-WWF with an American hero gimmick based on his gold medal win at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Angle presented himself as a role model and stressed the need to work hard to realize one&#x27;s dreams. Although such a personality appears appropriate for a face wrestler, Angle&#x27;s character was arrogant and constantly reminded people of his Olympic glory, behaving as if he thought he was better than the fans. Angle&#x27;s character served as a meta-reference to how wrestling had changed. Although his character was intended to be a heel and behaved accordingly, some commentators speculated that if Angle attempted to get over as a face using a more heroic version of the same character, he would have failed. Unusually, Angle did not use any of these heroic mannerisms when playing a face character, instead acting as somewhat of an antihero with a few elements of the &quot;lovable loser&quot; character archetype.

The majority of the time, faces who are low-carders, or lesser known, are used as jobbers. These wrestlers usually lose matches against established wrestlers, often heels that then lose to the top faces.

== Fan reactions ==
Fans sometimes dislike face wrestlers despite the way they are promoted. Some reasons for this include repetitive in-ring antics, a limited moveset, a lengthy title reign, lack of selling their opponents&#x27; moves, or an uninteresting character. This often results in wrestlers who are supposed to be cheered receiving a negative or no reaction from the fans. When this happens, it can prompt a change in character for the wrestler in question. For example, Batista&#x27;s run as a face upon his return to the WWE in 2014 was met with overwhelmingly negative reactions from the fans. Because of this unexpected reaction, Batista turned heel within just a few months of his return.

The reaction of the fans can also influence a wrestler&#x27;s booking and position on the card. Faces that get more support than expected sometimes move closer towards the main event scene, while those getting less of a reaction than hoped might move down on the card. While Batista was getting bad reactions in 2014, another face Daniel Bryan, was getting incredibly positive support. Loud &quot;Yes!&quot; chants that had become synonymous with Bryan were present at any show he was on, and eventually the main event of WrestleMania XXX would be changed from Batista vs Randy Orton for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, to a triple threat match with Daniel Bryan which he would go on to win.

== Mannerisms ==

Some face wrestlers often give high fives or give out merchandise to fans while entering the ring before their match, such as T-shirts, sunglasses, hats and masks. Bret Hart was one of the first superstars to make this popular, as he would drape his signature sunglasses on a child in the audience. Rey Mysterio, who has been a face in WWE since his debut, would go to any fan (frequently a child) wearing a replica of his mask and touch their head with his head for good luck before wrestling. Other examples include John Cena throwing his shirts and caps in the crowd before entering a match and Big Show giving his hat to a fan when he was a face. 

Some faces, such as Bret Hart and Ricky Steamboat, promoted an image as a &quot;family man&quot; and supported their persona by appearing with their family members before and after matches. Steamboat famously carried his 8-month-old son Richard Jr. into the ring with him at WrestleMania IV before his match with Greg &quot;The Hammer&quot; Valentine, then handing him to his wife Bonnie before the match started, and was accompanied to the ring by his family during his rivalry with Ric Flair in Jim Crockett Promotions to contrast with Flair&#x27;s party animal &quot;Nature Boy&quot; persona. These actions often relate to wrestlers promoting charity work or other actions outside the ring, blurring the lines between scripted wrestling and their personal lives.

In the ring, traditional faces are expected to abide by the rules and win matches by their own skill rather than by cheating, outside interference etc. Because heel wrestlers take little issues with using such tactics, the face enters many matches already at a disadvantage to the heel. By putting the face in a difficult situation, it can help to draw out sympathy and support from the audience. Traditional faces similar to Hulk Hogan tend to draw on support from the crowd when it&#x27;s time for them to make their big comeback.

In addition to wrestlers, commentators also portray face and heel dynamics. It is the job of the face commentator to criticize the tactics and behavior of the heel wrestler and gather support for the face wrestler. The face commentator gathers support for the face wrestler by mentioning how much of a disadvantage he is at, or by praising the hero&#x27;s morality and valor.

<text>Tathwell is a village in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England.

Tathwell is situated approximately south from the market town of Louth. The hamlet of Dovendale, alongside the A153 road to the west of the village is in the parish. The hamlet of Haugham lies about south-east of Tathwell. Cadwell Park motor racing circuit is about south of Tathwell.

The parish church, dedicated to Saint Vedast, also houses The Hamby Monument, a wall monument originally constructed around 1620, and later restored by their descendants, the Chaplin family. (Sir John Hamby&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth married in 1657 John Chaplin, son of Sir Francis Chaplin.)

Tathwell Hall at Tathwell was the longtime home of the Chaplin family, a branch of the Chaplin family of Baronets of Blankney, who served as MPs for Lincolnshire and who were descended from Sir Francis Chaplin, Lord Mayor of London in 1677. The family originated at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. It was through a marriage with the Hamby family that the Chaplins acquired Tathwell. The family became active in Lincolnshire, and in subsequent years many members of the Chaplin family stood for Parliament from Lincolnshire.

Near Cadwell and in Tathwell parish is Tathwell Long barrow. It is surrounded by trees, and in the middle of a field with no footpath, but visible from the road.

Tathwell&#x27;s war memorial cross is sited on a corner of the village main crossroads.

<doc id="557672" wikidata="Q754949" url="?curid=557672" title="Last Glacial Period">
<text>The Last Glacial Period (LGP), also known as the Last glacial cycle, occurred from the end of the Last Interglacial to the beginning of the Holocene, years ago, and thus corresponds to most of the timespan of the Late Pleistocene.

The LGP is part of a larger sequence of glacial and interglacial periods known as the Quaternary glaciation which started around 2,588,000 years ago and is ongoing. The glaciation and the current Quaternary Period both began with the formation of the Arctic ice cap. The Antarctic ice sheet began to form earlier, at about 34 Mya (million years ago), in the mid-Cenozoic (Eocene–Oligocene extinction event), and the term Late Cenozoic Ice Age is used to include this early phase with the current glaciation. The previous ice age within the Quaternary is the Penultimate Glacial Period, which ended about 128,000 years ago, was more severe than the Last Glacial Period in some areas such as Britain, but less severe in others.

The last glacial period saw alternating episodes of glacier advance and retreat with the Last Glacial Maximum occurring between 26,000 and 20,000 years ago. While the general pattern of cooling and glacier advance around the globe was similar, local differences make it difficult to compare the details from continent to continent (see picture of ice core data below for differences). The most recent cooling, the Younger Dryas, began around 12,800 years ago and ended around 11,700 years ago, also marking the end of the LGP and the Pleistocene epoch. It was followed by the Holocene, the current geological epoch.

==Origin and definition==

The LGP is often colloquially referred to as the &quot;last ice age&quot;, though the term ice age is not strictly defined, and on a longer geological perspective, the last few million years could be termed a single ice age given the continual presence of ice sheets near both poles. Glacials are somewhat better defined, as colder phases during which glaciers advance, separated by relatively warm interglacials. The end of the last glacial period, which was about 10,000 years ago, is often called the end of the ice age, although extensive year-round ice persists in Antarctica and Greenland. Over the past few million years, the glacial-interglacial cycles have been &quot;paced&quot; by periodic variations in the Earth&#x27;s orbit via Milankovitch cycles.

The LGP has been intensively studied in North America, northern Eurasia, the Himalayas, and other formerly glaciated regions around the world. The glaciations that occurred during this glacial period covered many areas, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere and to a lesser extent in the Southern Hemisphere. They have different names, historically developed and depending on their geographic distributions: &quot;Fraser&quot; (in the Pacific Cordillera of North America), &quot;Pinedale&quot; (in the Central Rocky Mountains), &quot;Wisconsinan&quot; or &quot;Wisconsin&quot; (in central North America), &quot;Devensian&quot; (in the British Isles), &quot;Midlandian&quot; (in Ireland), &quot;Würm&quot; (in the Alps), &quot;Mérida&quot; (in Venezuela), &quot;Weichselian&quot; or &quot;Vistulian&quot; (in Northern Europe and northern Central Europe), &quot;Valdai&quot; in Russia and &quot;Zyryanka&quot; in Siberia, &quot;Llanquihue&quot; in Chile, and &quot;Otira&quot; in New Zealand. The geochronological Late Pleistocene includes the late glacial (Weichselian) and the immediately preceding penultimate interglacial (Eemian) period.

==Overview==

===Northern Hemisphere===
Canada was almost completely covered by ice, as was the northern part of the United States, both blanketed by the huge Laurentide Ice Sheet. Alaska remained mostly ice free due to arid climate conditions. Local glaciations existed in the Rocky Mountains and the Cordilleran ice sheet and as ice fields and ice caps in the Sierra Nevada in northern California. In northern Eurasia, the Scandinavian ice sheet once again reached the northern parts of the British Isles, Germany, Poland, and Russia, extending as far east as the Taymyr Peninsula in western Siberia.

The maximum extent of western Siberian glaciation was reached by about 18,000 to 17,000 BP, later than in Europe (22,000–18,000 BP). Northeastern Siberia was not covered by a continental-scale ice sheet. Instead, large, but restricted, icefield complexes covered mountain ranges within northeast Siberia, including the Kamchatka-Koryak Mountains.

The Arctic Ocean between the huge ice sheets of America and Eurasia was not frozen throughout, but like today, probably was covered only by relatively shallow ice, subject to seasonal changes and riddled with icebergs calving from the surrounding ice sheets. According to the sediment composition retrieved from deep-sea cores, even times of seasonally open waters must have occurred.

Outside the main ice sheets, widespread glaciation occurred on the highest mountains of the Alpide belt. In contrast to the earlier glacial stages, the Würm glaciation was composed of smaller ice caps and mostly confined to valley glaciers, sending glacial lobes into the Alpine foreland. Local ice fields or small ice sheets could be found capping the highest massifs of the Pyrenees, the Carpathian Mountains, the Balkan Mountains, the Caucasus, and the mountains of Turkey and Iran.

In the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau, there is evidence that glaciers advanced considerably, particularly between 47,000 and 27,000 BP, but the exact ages, as well as the formation of a single contiguous ice sheet on the Tibetan Plateau, is controversial.

Other areas of the Northern Hemisphere did not bear extensive ice sheets, but local glaciers were widespread at high altitudes. Parts of Taiwan, for example, were repeatedly glaciated between 44,250 and 10,680 BP as well as the Japanese Alps. In both areas, maximum glacier advance occurred between 60,000 and 30,000 BP. To a still lesser extent, glaciers existed in Africa, for example in the High Atlas, the mountains of Morocco, the Mount Atakor massif in southern Algeria, and several mountains in Ethiopia. Just south of the equator, an ice cap of several hundred square kilometers was present on the east African mountains in the Kilimanjaro massif, Mount Kenya, and the Rwenzori Mountains, which still bear relic glaciers today.

===Southern Hemisphere===
Glaciation of the Southern Hemisphere was less extensive. Ice sheets existed in the Andes (Patagonian Ice Sheet), where six glacier advances between 33,500 and 13,900 BP in the Chilean Andes have been reported. Antarctica was entirely glaciated, much like today, but unlike today the ice sheet left no uncovered area. In mainland Australia only a very small area in the vicinity of Mount Kosciuszko was glaciated, whereas in Tasmania glaciation was more widespread. An ice sheet formed in New Zealand, covering all of the Southern Alps, where at least three glacial advances can be distinguished.

Local ice caps existed in the highest mountains of the island of New Guinea, where temperatures were 5 to 6 °C colder than at present. The main areas of Papua New Guinea where glaciers developed during the LGP were the Central Cordillera, the Owen Stanley Range, and the Saruwaged Range. Mount Giluwe in the Central Cordillera had a &quot;more or less continuous ice cap covering about 188 km2 and extending down to 3200-3500 m&quot;. In Western New Guinea, remnants of these glaciers are still preserved atop Puncak Jaya and Ngga Pilimsit.

Small glaciers developed in a few favorable places in Southern Africa during the last glacial period. These small glaciers would have been located in the Lesotho Highlands and parts of the Drakensberg. The development of glaciers was likely aided in part due to shade provided by adjacent cliffs. Various moraines and former glacial niches have been identified in the eastern Lesotho Highlands a few kilometres west of the Great Escarpment, at altitudes greater than 3,000 m on south-facing slopes. Studies suggest that the annual average temperature in the mountains of Southern Africa was about 6 °C colder than at present, in line with temperature drops estimated for Tasmania and southern Patagonia during the same time. This resulted in an environment of relatively arid periglaciation without permafrost, but with deep seasonal freezing on south-facing slopes. Periglaciation in the eastern Drakensberg and Lesotho Highlands produced solifluction deposits and blockfields; including blockstreams and stone garlands.

==Deglaciation==

Scientists from the Center for Arctic Gas Hydrate, Environment and Climate at the University of Tromsø, published a study in June 2017
describing over a hundred ocean sediment craters, some 3,000 m wide and up to 300 m deep, formed by explosive eruptions of methane from destabilized methane hydrates, following ice-sheet retreat during the LGP, around 12,000 years ago. These areas around the Barents Sea still seep methane today. The study hypothesized that existing bulges containing methane reservoirs could eventually have the same fate.

==Named local glaciations==

=== Antarctica ===
During the last glacial period, Antarctica was blanketed by a massive ice sheet, much as it is today. The ice covered all land areas and extended into the ocean onto the middle and outer continental shelf. Counterintuitively though, according to ice modeling done in 2002, ice over central East Antarctica was generally thinner than it is today.

===Europe===

====Devensian and Midlandian glaciation (Britain and Ireland)====
British geologists refer to the LGP as the Devensian. Irish geologists, geographers, and archaeologists refer to the Midlandian glaciation, as its effects in Ireland are largely visible in the Irish Midlands. The name Devensian is derived from the Latin &quot;Dēvenses&quot;, people living by the Dee (&quot;Dēva&quot; in Latin), a river on the Welsh border near which deposits from the period are particularly well represented.

The effects of this glaciation can be seen in many geological features of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Its deposits have been found overlying material from the preceding Ipswichian stage and lying beneath those from the following Holocene, which is the current stage. This is sometimes called the Flandrian interglacial in Britain.

The latter part of the Devensian includes pollen zones I–IV, the Allerød oscillation and Bølling oscillation, and the Oldest Dryas, Older Dryas, and Younger Dryas cold periods.

====Weichselian glaciation (Scandinavia and northern Europe)====

Alternative names include &quot;Weichsel glaciation&quot; or &quot;Vistulian glaciation&quot; (referring to the Polish River Vistula or its German name Weichsel). Evidence suggests that the ice sheets were at their maximum size for only a short period, between 25,000 and 13,000 BP. Eight interstadials have been recognized in the Weichselian, including the Oerel, Glinde, Moershoofd, Hengelo, and Denekamp. Correlation with isotope stages is still in process. During the glacial maximum in Scandinavia, only the western parts of Jutland were ice-free, and a large part of what is today the North Sea was dry land connecting Jutland with Britain (see Doggerland).

The Baltic Sea, with its unique brackish water, is a result of meltwater from the Weichsel glaciation combining with saltwater from the North Sea when the straits between Sweden and Denmark opened. Initially, when the ice began melting about 10,300 BP, seawater filled the isostatically depressed area, a temporary marine incursion that geologists dub the Yoldia Sea. Then, as postglacial isostatic rebound lifted the region about 9500 BP, the deepest basin of the Baltic became a freshwater lake, in palaeological contexts referred to as Ancylus Lake, which is identifiable in the freshwater fauna found in sediment cores.

The lake was filled by glacial runoff, but as worldwide sea level continued rising, saltwater again breached the sill about 8000 BP, forming a marine Littorina Sea, which was followed by another freshwater phase before the present brackish marine system was established. &quot;At its present state of development, the marine life of the Baltic Sea is less than about 4000 years old&quot;, Drs. Thulin and Andrushaitis remarked when reviewing these sequences in 2003.

Overlying ice had exerted pressure on the Earth&#x27;s surface. As a result of melting ice, the land has continued to rise yearly in Scandinavia, mostly in northern Sweden and Finland, where the land is rising at a rate of as much as 8–9 mm per year, or 1 m in 100 years. This is important for archaeologists, since a site that was coastal in the Nordic Stone Age now is inland and can be dated by its relative distance from the present shore.

====Würm glaciation (Alps)====

The term &quot;Würm&quot; is derived from a river in the Alpine foreland, roughly marking the maximum glacier advance of this particular glacial period. The Alps were where the first systematic scientific research on ice ages was conducted by Louis Agassiz at the beginning of the 19th century. Here, the Würm glaciation of the LGP was intensively studied. Pollen analysis, the statistical analyses of microfossilized plant pollens found in geological deposits, chronicled the dramatic changes in the European environment during the Würm glaciation. During the height of Würm glaciation,  BP, most of western and central Europe and Eurasia was open steppe-tundra, while the Alps presented solid ice fields and montane glaciers. Scandinavia and much of Britain were under ice.

During the Würm, the Rhône Glacier covered the whole western Swiss plateau, reaching today&#x27;s regions of Solothurn and Aargau. In the region of Bern, it merged with the Aar glacier. The Rhine Glacier is currently the subject of the most detailed studies. Glaciers of the Reuss and the Limmat advanced sometimes as far as the Jura. Montane and piedmont glaciers formed the land by grinding away virtually all traces of the older Günz and Mindel glaciation, by depositing base moraines and terminal moraines of different retraction phases and loess deposits, and by the proglacial rivers&#x27; shifting and redepositing gravels. Beneath the surface, they had profound and lasting influence on geothermal heat and the patterns of deep groundwater flow.

===North America===

====Pinedale or Fraser glaciation (Rocky Mountains)====
The Pinedale (central Rocky Mountains) or Fraser (Cordilleran ice sheet) glaciation was the last of the major glaciations to appear in the Rocky Mountains in the United States. The Pinedale lasted from around 30,000 to 10,000 years ago, and was at its greatest extent between 23,500 and 21,000 years ago. This glaciation was somewhat distinct from the main Wisconsin glaciation, as it was only loosely related to the giant ice sheets and was instead composed of mountain glaciers, merging into the Cordilleran ice sheet.

The Cordilleran ice sheet produced features such as glacial Lake Missoula, which broke free from its ice dam, causing the massive Missoula Floods. USGS geologists estimate that the cycle of flooding and reformation of the lake lasted an average of 55 years and that the floods occurred about 40 times over the 2,000-year period starting 15,000 years ago. Glacial lake outburst floods such as these are not uncommon today in Iceland and other places.

====Wisconsin glaciation====
The Wisconsin glacial episode was the last major advance of continental glaciers in the North American Laurentide ice sheet. At the height of glaciation, the Bering land bridge potentially permitted migration of mammals, including people, to North America from Siberia.

It radically altered the geography of North America north of the Ohio River. At the height of the Wisconsin episode glaciation, ice covered most of Canada, the Upper Midwest, and New England, as well as parts of Montana and Washington. On Kelleys Island in Lake Erie or in New York&#x27;s Central Park, the grooves left by these glaciers can be easily observed. In southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta, a suture zone between the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets formed the Cypress Hills, which is the northernmost point in North America that remained south of the continental ice sheets.

The Great Lakes are the result of glacial scour and pooling of meltwater at the rim of the receding ice. When the enormous mass of the continental ice sheet retreated, the Great Lakes began gradually moving south due to isostatic rebound of the north shore. Niagara Falls is also a product of the glaciation, as is the course of the Ohio River, which largely supplanted the prior Teays River.

With the assistance of several very broad glacial lakes, it released floods through the gorge of the Upper Mississippi River, which in turn was formed during an earlier glacial period.

In its retreat, the Wisconsin episode glaciation left terminal moraines that form Long Island, Block Island, Cape Cod, Nomans Land, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Nantucket, Sable Island, and the Oak Ridges Moraine in south-central Ontario, Canada. In Wisconsin itself, it left the Kettle Moraine. The drumlins and eskers formed at its melting edge are landmarks of the lower Connecticut River Valley.

====Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga, Sierra Nevada====
In the Sierra Nevada, three stages of glacial maxima, sometimes incorrectly called ice ages, were separated by warmer periods. These glacial maxima are called, from oldest to youngest, Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Tahoe reached its maximum extent perhaps about 70,000 years ago. Little is known about the Tenaya. The Tioga was the least severe and last of the Wisconsin episode. It began about 30,000 years ago, reached its greatest advance 21,000 years ago, and ended about 10,000 years ago.

====Greenland glaciation====
In northwest Greenland, ice coverage attained a very early maximum in the LGP around 114,000. After this early maximum, ice coverage was similar to today until the end of the last glacial period. Towards the end, glaciers advanced once more before retreating to their present extent. According to ice core data, the Greenland climate was dry during the LGP, with precipitation reaching perhaps only 20% of today&#x27;s value.

=== South America ===

====Mérida glaciation (Venezuelan Andes)====

The name &quot;Mérida&quot; glaciation is proposed to designate the alpine glaciation that affected the central Venezuelan Andes during the Late Pleistocene. Two main moraine levels have been recognized - one with an elevation of , and another with an elevation of . The snow line during the last glacial advance was lowered approximately below the present snow line, which is . The glaciated area in the Cordillera de Mérida was about ; this included these high areas, from southwest to northeast: Páramo de Tamá, Páramo Batallón, Páramo Los Conejos, Páramo Piedras Blancas, and Teta de Niquitao. Around of the total glaciated area was in the Sierra Nevada de Mérida, and of that amount, the largest concentration, , was in the areas of Pico Bolívar, Pico Humboldt [], and Pico Bonpland []. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the moraines are older than 10,000 BP, and probably older than 13,000 BP. The lower moraine level probably corresponds to the main Wisconsin glacial advance. The upper level probably represents the last glacial advance (Late Wisconsin).

====Llanquihue glaciation (Southern Andes)====

The Llanquihue glaciation takes its name from Llanquihue Lake in southern Chile, which is a fan-shaped piedmont glacial lake. On the lake&#x27;s western shores, large moraine systems occur, of which the innermost belong to the LGP. Llanquihue Lake&#x27;s varves are a node point in southern Chile&#x27;s varve geochronology. During the last glacial maximum, the Patagonian ice sheet extended over the Andes from about 35°S to Tierra del Fuego at 55°S. The western part appears to have been very active, with wet basal conditions, while the eastern part was cold-based.

Cryogenic features such as ice wedges, patterned ground, pingos, rock glaciers, palsas, soil cryoturbation, and solifluction deposits developed in unglaciated extra-Andean Patagonia during the last glaciation, but not all these reported features have been verified. The area west of Llanquihue Lake was ice-free during the last glacial maximum, and had sparsely distributed vegetation dominated by &quot;Nothofagus&quot;. Valdivian temperate rain forest was reduced to scattered remnants on the western side of the Andes.

<text>Adetomyrma is a genus of ants endemic to Madagascar. Workers of this genus are blind. The type species &quot;Adetomyrma venatrix&quot; was described in 1994, with the genus being an atypical member of its tribe, the Amblyoponini. This tribe includes the Dracula ants, members of which can feed on the hemolymph of larvae and pupae.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Adetomyrma&quot; was first described as a Malagasy endemic monotypic genus by Ward in 1994. Ward (1994) assigned this genus to Amblyoponini within the subfamily Ponerinae on the basis of the worker morphology of the type species &quot;Adetomyrma venatrix&quot;. Later, Bolton (2003) raised this tribe to subfamily status as Amblyoponinae.

==Biology==
The colonies, the first of which was found in a rotting log, may contain as many as 10,000 workers, winged males and several wingless queens (the majority of ant species feature winged queens). The workers use venom to stun their prey which are brought back to the colony for the larvae to feed upon. The colour of the winged males, a darker orange than the workers, suggests they disperse by flying to other colonies before mating.

==Known species==
*&quot;Adetomyrma aureocuprea&quot; 
*&quot;Adetomyrma bressleri&quot; 
*&quot;Adetomyrma caputleae&quot; 
*&quot;Adetomyrma cassis&quot; 
*&quot;Adetomyrma caudapinniger&quot; 
*&quot;Adetomyrma cilium&quot; 
*&quot;Adetomyrma clarivida&quot; 
*&quot;Adetomyrma goblin&quot;

<text>Freaks (released with the subtitle Ten Stories About Power, Claustrophobia, Suffocation and Holding Hands) is the second studio album by English rock band Pulp, released on 11 May 1987 by Fire Records.

==Release and aftermath==

&quot;Freaks&quot; was released in 1987 to little commercial success and features a much darker sound than its predecessor, &quot;It&quot;. Russell Senior sings lead vocals on &quot;Fairground&quot; and &quot;Anorexic Beauty&quot;. &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; was released as a single in an alternative version called the &quot;sanitised version&quot;; it replaces the word &quot;masturbates&quot; with &quot;vegetates&quot;.

&quot;I Want You&quot; is the only song from the album to have been performed live regularly, most notably during the UK Forest Tour in the Summer of 2002.

The album was reissued and remastered by Fire Records in 2012 along with 1983&#x27;s &quot;It&quot; and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Separations&quot;. This re-release took several delays as the first stated release date was 8 August 2011 while the albums finally came out on 13 February 2012. An announcement in the interim stated that the albums would be remastered with new bonus tracks to be added to the track listings as well as new artwork and liner notes from music journalist Everett True.

The reissue bonus disc is in fact &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; compilation aside from two tracks: &quot;They Suffocate at Night&quot; which appears on the album itself and &quot;Master of the Universe (sanitised version)&quot; which again appears on the album without censorship.

<text>Charfield is a village and civil parish in Gloucestershire, England, south-west of Wotton-under-Edge near the Little Avon River and the villages of Falfield and Cromhall. The parish includes the hamlet of Churchend.

==Village==
Charfield is a medium-sized village of about 2,500 residents with two pubs, The Railway Tavern and The Plough Inn, a convenience store with Post Office, a cafe, a petrol station with a small shop, a Co-op (opened December 2023) as well as two churches. There are seven main housing areas. Farm Lees, Longs View, Manor Lane and Woodlands have existed for some time. Two new housing developments were built in 2018-2019: St James Mews, opposite St John&#x27;s Church, and Charfield Village, at the eastern end of the village near the Renishaw PLC site, as well as the Posket Way development, which includes the Bridge Cafe. The primary school has around 250 students.

The Church of St James, in Churchend, dates from the 13th century and is a grade I listed building.

==Governance==
An electoral ward with the same name exists. This ward starts in the east in Charfield and then stretches west to Falfield. The ward&#x27;s population at the 2011 census was 4,678.

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the Memorial Hall and playing field and playground, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

The parish council is also a burial authority, and has its own burial ground in nearby Churchend.

==Railway==
The Bristol-Birmingham main railway line runs through the village. Charfield railway station closed in January 1965 but still stands, and discussions continue about the viability of re-opening it. The costs of re-opening would be shared between Gloucestershire and South Gloucestershire Councils since, although the station would be in South Gloucestershire, the nearby Gloucestershire town of Wotton-under-Edge would be a principal beneficiary.

The railway line marks the division of the village between two different telephone areas (01453-54x based on Wotton-under-Edge, and 01454-26x based on Falfield). The village is on the outer limits of both areas. The village has now been fibre-enabled, allowing FTTC connections.

On 11 October 2022 it was announced that South Gloucestershire Council and Network Rail have submitted a planning application for a new train station in Charfield. The proposed station, to be built on land off Station Road in the centre of the village, will include two platforms serving north and southbound journeys, a pedestrian footbridge, a bus stop, covered cycle parking, and car parking.

==Railway history==
The Charfield railway disaster was a fatal train crash which occurred on 13 October 1928. The Leeds to Bristol LMS night mail train crashed under a road bridge near Charfield railway station, killing 15 and injuring 23. Amongst the dead were two children whose remains remain unidentified.

==Charfield Memorial Hall and Playing Field==
Charfield Memorial Hall and Playing Field is in the centre of Charfield. The Hall has recently been refurbished and the play area upgraded with new equipment.

<doc id="557681" wikidata="Q4020153" url="?curid=557681" title="William Somerset, 3rd Earl of Worcester">
<text>William Somerset, 3rd Earl of Worcester, KG (c. 1526/1527 – 21 February 1589) was an English courtier, nobleman, and politician. He was the eldest son of Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester and his second wife Elizabeth Browne.

== Earl of Worcester ==
On 26 November 1549, he succeeded his father and became the 3rd Earl of Worcester.

Worcester supported Lady Jane Grey in 1553. He was invested as Knight, Order of the Garter (K.G.) in 1570. He was a patron of the arts, and sponsored - among others - the Elizabethan actor Edward Alleyn.

== Marriages and children ==
Before 19 May 1550, Worcester married Christiana North, daughter of Edward North, 1st Baron North and his wife Alice Squire. They were parents to three children:
*Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester (d. 3 March 1628).
*Elizabeth Somerset. Married William Windsor. He was a namesake son of William Windsor, 2nd Baron Windsor by his wife Margaret Sambourne.
*Lucy Somerset. Married Henry Herbert, Esquire.

William Somerset re-married (2nd) before 1567 Theophila Newton, daughter of John Newton (otherwise Cradock), Knt., of East Harptree, Somerset, by Margaret, daughter of Anthony Poyntz, Knt. A portrait of Countess Theophila by an unknown artist of that date is mentioned by Ashelford, Visual History of Costume (1983): 72.

== Death ==
William Somerset died at his house Hackney on 21 February 1589 and was buried in the Church of St Cadoc, Raglan, Monmouthshire.

<doc id="557683" wikidata="Q7380271" url="?curid=557683" title="Rupert Cross">
<text>Sir Alfred Rupert Neale Cross (15 June 1912 in Chelsea, London – 12 September 1980, Oxford) was an English legal scholar. He was the second of two sons of Arthur George Cross, an architect in Hastings, and Mary Elizabeth (née Dalton).

== Biography ==
He was born with cancer of the eyes and was completely blind after an operation at the age of 1. Worcester College for the Blind provided his education before he went to Worcester College, Oxford in 1930 where he took a Second in Modern History in 1933.

Cross remained at Oxford to read for a second school, that of Jurisprudence. He received great help and encouragement from Theo Tyler, Fellow and Tutor in Law at Balliol College, Oxford. Tyler himself was nearly blind. Under his stimulus and rigour, Cross gained a First in Jurisprudence in 1935. &#x27;[H]ad he not been overstanding for honours he would have obtained a First in BCL, which he took in 1937&#x27;, according to H. L. A. Hart. He was awarded the degree of D.C.L. in 1958.

Cross became a solicitor in 1939 and was a tutor, Law Society, from 1945 to 1948.
From 1948 to 1964 he was a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. He held a Visiting Professorship in the University of Adelaide, Australia, 1962, and in the University of Sydney, 1968. On the retirement of Harold Hanbury, Cross was elected Vinerian Professor of English Law in the University of Oxford, a position he held from 1964 to 1979. The Vinerian Professorship carried a Fellowship at All Souls College. He was a Fellow of the British Academy from 1967 and received a knighthood in 1973.

In 1937 he married Aline Heather Chadwick, the daughter of a Leeds solicitor; they had no children.

As an undergraduate Cross represented Oxford University four times (1931–34) on the top board in the prestigious annual Varsity chess match against Cambridge University. He played several times in the top section of the British Chess Championship in the 1930s (for which only an elite group of twelve players qualified).

Cross&#x27;s elder brother, Geoffrey, also became a lawyer and achieved distinction. He was a Prize Fellow at Trinity College, Cambridge, and became in succession a Judge of the Chancery Division, a Lord Justice of Appeal, and a Lord Appeal in Ordinary.

==Works==
His best-known work is probably &quot;Cross on Evidence&quot;, first published in 1959. In 1976 Cross published &quot;Statutory Interpretation&quot;. This book has been sufficiently well regarded that two posthumous editions have been produced, under the editorship of John Bell and George Engle. In recognition of Cross&#x27;s great prestige, his name has remained in the predominant spot on the title page.

<text>In chess, the fianchetto ( or ; &quot;little flank&quot;) is a pattern of wherein a bishop is developed to the second of the adjacent b- or g-, the having been moved one or two squares forward.

The fianchetto is a staple of many &quot;hypermodern&quot; openings, whose philosophy is to delay direct occupation of the with the plan of undermining and destroying the opponent&#x27;s occupied centre. It also regularly occurs in Indian defences. The fianchetto is less common in Open Games (1.e4 e5), but the is sometimes fianchettoed by Black in the Ruy Lopez or by White in an uncommon variation of the Vienna Game.

One of the major benefits of the fianchetto is that it often allows the fianchettoed bishop to become more active. A fianchettoed position, however, also presents some opportunities for the opponent: if the fianchettoed bishop can be exchanged, the squares the bishop was formerly protecting will become weak (see &quot;&quot;) and can form the basis of an attack (particularly if the fianchetto was performed on the ). Exchanging the fianchettoed bishop should not be done lightly, therefore, especially if the enemy bishop on same-coloured squares is still on the board.
==Concept==
The diagram shows three different sorts of fianchetti (not from an actual game, but as examples collapsed into a single diagram). White&#x27;s king bishop is in a regular fianchetto, with the knight pawn advanced one square and the bishop occupying the . This is by far the most common type of fianchetto, seen in the Sicilian Dragon, Pirc Defence, Modern Defence, Modern Benoni, Grünfeld Defence, Nimzo-Indian, and King&#x27;s Indian Defence, among other openings. The regular fianchetto of both bishops by a player is called a &quot;double fianchetto&quot;. 

Black&#x27;s is also fianchettoed, but the knight pawn has moved forward two squares, making this a &quot;long fianchetto&quot;. The b-pawn also controls the c4-square, which is often advantageous. If White plays the King&#x27;s Indian Attack 1.Nf3 2.g3, Black may play a long fianchetto to oppose White&#x27;s bishop and make it more difficult for White to play a c4 . A long fianchetto on the kingside is more rarely played, because it weakens the pawn shield in front of the castled position and controls a less important square. Nevertheless, Grob&#x27;s Attack 1.g4 and the Borg Defence (&quot;Grob&quot; backwards) 1.e4 g5 are sometimes played by players such as IM Michael Basman.

White&#x27;s queen bishop has moved to a3 in what is sometimes called an &quot;extended fianchetto&quot;. Rather than control the long diagonal, it takes aim at Black&#x27;s f8-square. If Black moves his e-pawn, White can play Bxf8, after which Black will have to waste on artificial castling after recapturing with his king. This tactic is often seen in the Evans Gambit and gives the Benko Gambit much of its bite. Black often plays ...Ba6 in the French Defence, and in the Queen&#x27;s Indian Defence if White plays g3 in order to fianchetto his own bishop (Aron Nimzowitsch&#x27;s move against the classical main line).

==Four fianchettoed bishops==

The game Rubinstein–Nimzowitsch, Marienbad 1925, had four fianchettoed bishops, two developed knights, and two on their home squares. In this position, Nimzowitsch humorously pointed out in &quot;My System&quot;: &quot;Each side castles now with a clear conscience, for not even the most hypermodern pair of masters can produce more than four fianchettoed Bishops!&quot;

<text>Terragen is a scenery generator program for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X developed and published by Planetside Software. It can be used to create renderings and animations of landscapes.

==History==

Released in stages (tech preview and beta) to a participating community, Terragen 2 was released to pre-purchasers on 2 April 2009. Terragen 2 is offered in feature limited freeware and full-featured commercial licenses.

Planetside Software released the first public version of Terragen 2 after more than three years of development of both the core technologies and the program itself. Since then there have been several released updates to both licenses of the software along the development cycle with a series of technology previews and a beta release. The &quot;final&quot; build was released on April 23, 2009, and more updates, including feature modules, are expected to be released later.

Planetside released Terragen 3 in August 2013. Version 3.1 was released in February 2014. Version 4 was released in 2016.


==Terragen Classic==
Terragen Classic is popular among amateur artists, which can be attributed to it being freeware, its intuitive interface, and its capability to create photorealistic landscapes when used skillfully. It can also use DEM (digital elevation model) files, and other graphic surface maps for rendering.

A commercial version of the software is also available and is capable of creating larger terrains, renders with higher image resolution, larger terrain files, and better post-render anti-aliasing than the freeware version.

The terrain is generated from a two-dimensional heightmap. The program contains facilities for importing and exporting heightmaps to images, for use in other programs.

==Use in media==
Rendering software contributed by PlanetSide proprietor Matt Fairclough was used by Digital Domain for effects in &quot;Star Trek Nemesis&quot;. Terragen Classic was used in &quot;The Golden Compass&quot;, the 2006 remake of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, games, and many TV commercials.

An image from what is now known as Terragen Classic appeared on the April 16, 2001, cover of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and Terragen was used for animations in Brandy Norwood&#x27;s &quot;What About Us?&quot; music video. The classic version was also used by numerous artists, such as Joan Fontcuberta (&quot;Orogenesis&quot; series), and the French photographer Mathieu Bernard-Reymond (&quot;Vous êtes ici&quot; series and &quot;Pôle&quot; series). Terragen Classic was used to create skyboxes for 3D video games such as &quot;Serious Sam&quot;.

The software was used by Devastudios to create the mountainous scenery in the intro used by Paramount Pictures for its centennial anniversary in 2012, alongside Autodesk Maya, with &quot;&quot; in 2011, which would be carried on for Paramount Players, Paramount Television Studios and Paramount+. Devastudios also used the software for the sky and clouds in the 2021 and 2023 Warner Bros. Pictures logos with &quot;Locked Down&quot; and &quot;Wonka&quot;, respectively, alongside the Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) and Adobe Substance 3D Painter for the latter, which would later be carried on for Warner Bros. Television, New Line Cinema and Warner Bros. Pictures Animation.

<doc id="557692" wikidata="Q1756316" url="?curid=557692" title="Separations (album)">
<text>Separations is the third album by English band Pulp, released on 19 June 1992 by UK indie Fire Records. Recorded in 1989, it appeared belatedly as the band&#x27;s final original release with Fire before their transition to a major-label career. 

==Recording, release and aftermath==

Pulp&#x27;s initial deal with Fire Records had expired, following the release of several singles and the 1987 LP &quot;Freaks&quot;, when in 1989 the label approached frontman Jarvis Cocker about re-signing the band. Whereas the group had, to its chagrin, only been allotted £600 to record &quot;Freaks,&quot; Fire now promised a £10,000 budget for its next project. Still wary from their prior experience with the label, the band booked Sheffield&#x27;s FON studio and producer Alan Smyth to begin recording what would become &quot;Separations;&quot; according to drummer Nick Banks, the band hoped to use the studio advance without actually formalising a new deal with Fire. 

The material represented a new direction for the band, with vocal-driven ballads on the first side and an acid house influence on the second. The disparate styles can be attributed to the interplay of tastes between Cocker and then-new bassist Steve Mackey; Mackey introduced Cocker to house music and raving upon the singer&#x27;s move to London, while Cocker introduced Mackey to &quot;Scott Walker and Serge Gainsbourg&quot;. Cocker was also inspired by the band Magazine&#x27;s early work that &quot;had attack to it combined with a real intelligence, without going into ponce territory&quot;. Notably, Banks ended up programming his parts into a drum machine rather than performing live on the record, a concession requested by Smyth out of concern for time and budget in light of the liberal use of MIDI sequencing requested by the band. &quot;Separations&quot; is also notable for the track &quot;This House Is Condemned&quot; being the last of the occasional vocal performances by guitarist/violinist/songwriter Russell Senior found throughout Pulp&#x27;s catalog, a role which he would later claim not to have ever relished:I used to &#x27;sing&#x27; in Pulp and I&#x27;m not quite sure why this came about, because I can&#x27;t sing for toffee and have never been under any illusions about it...I really wasn&#x27;t comfortable with singing in Pulp but Jarvis was keen on it, he said it gave him a break.Upon completing the album, with no discernible interest from any other label, the band reluctantly agreed to re-sign with Fire Records. 

The album was reissued and remastered by Fire in 2012 along with 1983&#x27;s &quot;It&quot; and 1987&#x27;s &quot;Freaks&quot;. This re-release took several delays as the first stated release date was 8 August 2011 while the albums finally came out on 13 February 2012. An announcement in the interim stated that the albums would be remastered with new bonus tracks to be added to the track listings as well as new artwork and liner notes from music journalist Everett True.

This re-release gives an opportunity to hear &quot;Death Comes to Town&quot; which was previously released in 2005 only on CD that accompanied Sheffield journalist Martin Lilleker&#x27;s book &quot;Beats Working for a Living&quot;. This 22-song CD featured rare tracks from some of the bands featured in the book.

&quot;Death Goes to the Disco&quot; and &quot;Is This House?&quot; are remixes of &quot;Death Comes To Town&quot; and &quot;This House Is Condemned&quot; respectively.

The bonus track &quot;Is This House?&quot; on the 2012 edition is labelled incorrectly. This track is taken from &quot;My Legendary Girlfriend&quot; single, where two remixes of the song &quot;This House Is Condemned&quot; by Parrot &amp; Winston can be found, but it is in fact the remix titled simply &quot;This House Is Condemned (Remix)&quot;

Scottish musician Momus claims that Cocker wrote to him with an offer to produce &quot;Separations&quot;, but that he ignored it.

<text>Chipping Sodbury is a market town and civil parish in the unitary authority area of South Gloucestershire, in the county of Gloucestershire, England. It is situated 13 miles (21 km) north-east of Bristol and directly east of Yate. The town was founded in the 12th century by William le Gros. It is the main settlement in the civil parish of Sodbury, which also includes the village of Old Sodbury.

At the 2011 census the population of Chipping Sodbury was 5,045, but the town has since become part of a larger built-up area due to the rapid expansion of nearby neighbouring town, Yate. The two towns are contiguous with one another.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name (not Sodbury) exists. This ward starts in the north at Chipping Sodbury Golf Course and stretches south to Dodington. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,834. In 1931 the parish had a population of 973. On 1 April 1946 the parish was abolished to form Sodbury.

==Transport==
East of the town is the Chipping Sodbury Tunnel, a railway tunnel under the Cotswolds 2 miles 924 yards (4.06 km) long, which was opened by the Great Western Railway in 1902. The tunnel is notorious for flooding in wet weather, often leading to disruption of services on the main railway line to and from South Wales. Chipping Sodbury had a station from 1903 to 1961. Yate station, on the Bristol to Birmingham main line, closed in January 1965 but reopened in May 1989.

The WESTlink on-demand bus serves the town.

==Cultural activities==

Chipping Sodbury hosts a twice yearly Mop Fair, usually the last weekends of March and September. The town holds a Festival Week in early June, including a &quot;Big Lunch&quot; where the main road is closed and residents bring picnics to eat on the street. A Big Lunch is also held in December to combat loneliness amongst elderly people at Christmas. There is a farmers&#x27; market twice a month, on the second and fourth Saturdays.

A Victorian Day is held on the first Saturday in December. The event starts with school choirs performing in the street, followed by the arrival of Father Christmas with snow guaranteed (from a blower). The streets are lined with stalls from local charities and organisations and old time amusements, including a Ferris wheel, Helter Skelter and two children&#x27;s rides. Choirs sing, bands play, the stalls bring a market feel, and a Hog Roast is held.

The town celebrated its 800th anniversary in August 2018 with a weekend of medieval activities including another Big Lunch. A time capsule was buried containing photographs of local businesses and poems written by local schoolchildren. The capsule is to be dug up on the town&#x27;s 900th anniversary in August 2118.

The town is served by a community radio station, GLOSS FM, which broadcasts 365 days a year on its webcasts and twice a year on 87.7 MHz FM. Chipping Sodbury Town Hall, which was remodelled in 1858, is a significant events venue in the town.

==Education==
Chipping Sodbury has two government funded primary schools and a secondary school.

Chipping Sodbury School, the secondary school, caters for children aged 11 to 18 and describes itself as a &#x27;Specialist Technology School&#x27;. The School shares a sixth form, named Cotswold Edge, with both Brimsham Green School and Yate International Academy. Subjects taken by students are split between the three locations. The School obtained a &#x27;Requires Improvement&#x27; status from Ofsted in 2018.

St John&#x27;s Mead Primary School is named after the parish church, St. John&#x27;s Chipping Sodbury. The other primary school is Raysfield Infants and Junior schools. Also within the parish boundary is Old Sodbury Primary School.

Dodington Parish Hall, which is situated next to Raysfield Junior and Infant Schools, is also the home of Raysfield Preschool.

==Toponymy ==
The town&#x27;s name is recorded in Old English (in the dative case) as &quot;Soppanbyrig&quot; = &quot;Soppa&#x27;s fort&quot;. &quot;Chipping&quot; (from Old English &quot;cēping&quot;) means that a market was held there.
==Notable people==

Edward Jenner, pioneer of vaccination in the 18th century, started his medical training in Sodbury, observing people catching cowpox and then &quot;not&quot; catching smallpox.

RC &quot;Jack&quot; Russell: former England cricket wicketkeeper and artist owns an art gallery in the town.

Sir James Dyson, inventor of the Dual Cyclone bagless vacuum cleaner, lives at Dodington Park just outside Chipping Sodbury.

J. K. Rowling, author of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fantasy series, was born in 1965 at the Chipping Sodbury Maternity Hospital (later the Chipping Sodbury Memorial Day Centre), on Station Road, Yate. Until the age of four, she lived with her parents in Sundridge Park, Yate.

<doc id="557698" wikidata="Q1802963" url="?curid=557698" title="Mansion">
<text>A mansion is a large dwelling house. The word itself derives through Old French from the Latin word &quot;mansio&quot; &quot;dwelling&quot;, an abstract noun derived from the verb &quot;manere&quot; &quot;to dwell&quot;. The English word &quot;manse&quot; originally defined a property large enough for the parish priest to maintain himself, but a mansion is usually no longer self-sustaining in this way (compare a Roman or medieval villa). &quot;Manor&quot; comes from the same root—territorial holdings granted to a lord who would &quot;remain&quot; there.
Following the fall of Rome, the practice of building unfortified villas ceased. Today, the oldest inhabited mansions around the world usually began their existence as fortified houses in the Middle Ages. As social conditions slowly changed and stabilized fortifications were able to be reduced, and over the centuries gave way to comfort. It became fashionable and possible for homes to be beautiful rather than grim and forbidding allowing for the development of the modern mansion.

In British English, a mansion block refers to a block of flats or apartments designed for the appearance of grandeur. In many parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Japan, the word mansion also refers to a block of apartments. In modern Japan, a &quot;manshon&quot; (), stemming from the English word &quot;mansion&quot;, is used to refer to a multi-unit apartment complex or condominium.

==15th to 18th-century development==
In Europe, from the 15th century onwards, a combination of politics and advances in weaponry negated the need for the aristocracy to live in fortified castles. As a result, many were transformed into mansions without defences or demolished and rebuilt in a more modern, undefended style. Due to intermarriage and primogeniture inheritance amongst the aristocracy, it became common for one noble to often own several country houses. These would be visited rotationally throughout the year as their owner pursued the social and sporting circuit from country home to country home. Many owners of a country house would also own a town mansion in their country&#x27;s capital city. These town mansions were referred to as &#x27;houses&#x27; in London, &#x27;hôtels particuliers&#x27; in Paris, and &#x27;palaces&#x27; in most European cities elsewhere. It might be noted that sometimes the house of a clergyman was called a &quot;mansion house&quot; (e.g., by the Revd. James Blair, Commissary in Virginia for the Bishop of London, 1689–1745, a term related to the word &quot;manse&quot; commonly used in the Church of Scotland and in Non-Conformist churches. H.G. Herklots, The Church of England and the American Episcopal Church).
As the 16th century progressed and the Renaissance style slowly spread across Europe, the last vestiges of castle architecture and life changed; the central points of these great houses became redundant as owners wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house into distant wings, while the owners began to live in airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to their specifically delegated areas—often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change, as the educated prided themselves on enlightenment.

The uses of these edifices paralleled that of the Roman villas. It was vital for powerful people and families to keep in social contact with each other as they were the primary moulders of society. The rounds of visits and entertainments were an essential part of the societal process, as described in the novels of Jane Austen. State business was often discussed and determined in informal settings. Times of revolution reversed this value. During July/August 1789, a significant number of French country mansions (chateaux) were destroyed by the rural population as part of the Great Fear—a symbolic rejection of the feudal rights and restraints in effect under the Ancien Régime.

Until World War I it was not unusual for a moderately sized mansion in England such as Cliveden to have an indoor staff of 20 and an outside staff of the same size, and in ducal mansions such as Chatsworth House the numbers could be far higher. In the great houses of Italy, the number of retainers was often even greater than in England; whole families plus extended relations would often inhabit warrens of rooms in basements and attics. Most European mansions were also the hub of vast estates.

==19th-century development==
The 19th century saw the continuation of the building of mansions in the United States and Europe. These mansions were often smaller than those built by the old European aristocracy. The new builders of mansions at the time explored new styles other than the Gothic tastes in architecture which were used often. They experimented with 19th-century versions of older Renaissance and Tudoresque styles; The Breakers in Rhode Island is an example of American Renaissance revivalism.

During the 19th century, along with other streets in major cities, Fifth Avenue in New York City had many mansions. Many of these were designed by the leading architects of the day, often in European Gothic Revival style, and were built by families who were making their fortunes. However, nearly all of these have now been demolished. Whitemarsh Hall, a countryside estate in the U.S. was demolished in 1980, along with its extensive gardens, to make way for suburban developments. In Paris, London or Rome, many large mansions and palazzi built or remodeled during the era still survive.

Grand Federal style mansions designed by Samuel McIntire inhabit an area that, in 2012, is the largest collection of 17th- and 18th-century structures in the United States of America. This district in Salem, Massachusetts, is called the McIntire Historic District with the center being Chestnut Street. McIntire&#x27;s training came from his father and from books. He and his brothers, Joseph and Angler, began their careers as housewrights and carpenters while in their teens but, early on, Samuel&#x27;s work caught the eye of Salem&#x27;s pre-eminent merchant, Elias Hasket Derby. Over the next quarter century, McIntire built or remodelled a number of homes for Derby and members of his extended family. McIntire also worked occasionally on Derby&#x27;s vessels, and would fix a wagon or build a birdhouse if his patron desired. Hamilton Hall is a National Historic Landmark at 9 Chestnut Street in Salem, Massachusetts. Hamilton Hall was built in 1805 by Samuel McIntire and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. &quot;King&quot; Derby&#x27;s stamp of approval opened many other doors for McIntire, who went on to design and build mansions for John Gardner, Jerethmiel Peirce, Simon Forrester, and other wealthy Salem shipowners. He also built on Chestnut Street a function hall (named for Alexander Hamilton) and a church for the town&#x27;s merchant class. McIntire also designed the former Salem Court House and Registry of Deeds.

After 1793, Samuel McIntire worked exclusively in the architectural style developed by Robert Adam in Great Britain and brought to America by the great Boston architect, Charles Bulfinch. The delicate Adam style, which emphasized decorative elements and ornamentation, was preferred for McIntire, who was efficient in design and proportions and had skill as a woodcarver. Swags, rosettes, garlands, and his signature sheaths of wheat were carved in wood surfaces in McIntire homes built between 1793 and his death in 1811.
In Europe, some 19th-century mansions were often built as replicas of older houses; the Château de Ferrières in France was inspired by Mentmore Towers, which in turn is a copy of Wollaton Hall. Other mansions were built in the new and innovative styles of the new era such as the arts and crafts style: The Breakers is a pastiche of an Italian Renaissance palazzo; Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire is a mixture of various French châteaux. One of the most enduring and most frequently copied styles for a mansion is the Palladian – particularly so in the 18th century. However, the Gothic style was probably the most popular choice of design in the 19th century. The most bizarre example of this was probably Fonthill Abbey which actually set out to imitate the mansions which had truly evolved from medieval Gothic abbeys following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century.

Mansions built during and after the 19th century were not supported by the large estates of their predecessors. These new mansions were often built as the week-end retreats of businessmen who commuted to their offices by the new railways, which enabled them to leave the city more easily.

==Latin America==
In Latin America, the grand rural estate, the Hacienda, Estancia, in Portuguese speaking Brazil Fazenda or Estância, with the mansion as its stately center, is a characteristic feature.

Mansions tended to follow European architectural styles. Whereas until the second half of the 19th century, Portugal and Spain as the colonial (or former colonial) powers were the eminent models for architecture and upper-class lifestyle, towards the end of the 19th century they were sometimes replaced by then more dominant powers like France or England.

In comparably developed, densely populated countries like Mexico, feudal estates and their mansions were as grand and stately as in the Mediterranean old world, whereas where estates were founded in the sparsely populated remote areas like the Pampa of Argentina or Uruguay, where iron pillars, doors, windows, and furniture had to be brought from Europe by ship and afterwards ox cart, buildings were smaller, but normally still aspiring to evoke a stately impression, often featuring, like their earlier Italian counterparts, a morador.

In Venezuela, the traditional Spanish mansions with a garden in the center of the property are usually referred as &quot;Quinta&quot;.

==Size==
Some realtors in the US term mansions as houses that have a minimum of of floor space. Others claim a viable minimum could instead be of floor space, especially in a city environment.

<text>In professional wrestling, a gimmick generally refers to a wrestler&#x27;s in-ring persona, character, behaviour, attire, and/or other distinguishing traits while performing which are usually artificially created in order to draw fan interest. These in-ring personalities often involve costumes, makeup and catchphrases that they shout at their opponents or the fans. Gimmicks can be designed to work as good guys/heroes (babyfaces) or bad guys/villains (heel) depending on the wrestler&#x27;s desire to be popular or hated by the crowd. A tweener gimmick falls between the two extremes, such as wrestlers who manifests many heel and face traits such as Randy Orton&#x27;s viper gimmick. A wrestler may portray more than one gimmick over their career depending on the angle or the wrestling promotion that they are working for at that time.

Promotions will use gimmicks on more than one person, albeit at different times, occasionally taking advantage of a masked character which allows for the identity of the wrestler in question to be concealed. Razor Ramon was portrayed by both Scott Hall and Rick Bognar and Diesel was portrayed by Kevin Nash and then Glen Jacobs. Occasionally, a wrestler uses a gimmick as a tribute to another worker; such is the case of Ric Flair&#x27;s Nature Boy persona which he took on as an homage to the original Nature Boy, Buddy Rogers. When a wrestler acts outside their gimmick this is known as &#x27;breaking kayfabe&#x27;, a term showing pro wrestling&#x27;s linkages to theatre, where the more common term &quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot; is used.

Gimmicks are annually rated for the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; awards by the publication&#x27;s owner, professional wrestling journalists, and various industry insiders, such as Dave Meltzer, promoters, agents and performers, other journalists, historians, and fans. The two awards are given to the best and worst gimmick of that year.

==History==

=== Beginnings (1860s to 1940s) ===

Pro wrestling&#x27;s history has been tied to the use of gimmicks from its infancy. From its circus origins in the 1830s, showmen presented wrestlers under names such as &quot;Edward, the steel eater&quot;, &quot;Gustave d’Avignon, the bone wrecker&quot;, or &quot;Bonnet, the ox of the low Alps&quot; and challenged the public to knock them down for 500 francs.

During the late 19th century-early 20th century, when wrestler Frank Gotch rose to prominence, the focus became on contests largely legitimate (see catch wrestling), which largely resulted in the abandoning previous character gimmicks.

=== Television era (1950s to 1970s) ===

It was not until the First Golden Age of Professional Wrestling in the United States during the 1940s–1950s, when Gorgeous George created pro wrestling&#x27;s first major gimmick. His heel character focused on his looks and quickly antagonized the fans with his exaggerated effeminate behavior, drawing jealousy to the fans. Such showmanship was unheard of for the time; and consequently, arena crowds grew in size as fans turned out to ridicule George.

Gorgeous George&#x27;s impact and legacy on wrestling gimmicks was enormous, demonstrating how fast television changed the product from athletics to performance. Before him, wrestlers&#x27; gimmicks imitated &quot;ethnic terrors&quot;—Nazis, Middle Eastern Muslims (Arabs, Turks, Persians, Bengalis, Afghans, etc.), Japanese, Russians, etc.—but his success birthed a more individualistic and narcissist form of character.

He was one of the first pro-wrestlers to use entrance music, &quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; which always played as he made his way to the ring.

In Britain, television took British wrestling to the next level when in 1964, it went full-time as part of the &quot;World of Sport&quot; show.

The style of wrestling at the time was unique with strong emphasis on clean technical wrestling. Heels made up a minority of the roster, with most shows containing an abnormally high proportion of clean sportsmanly matches between two &quot;blue-eyes&quot; (as faces were known backstage in the UK). This would remain the case for several decades to come. Gimmick matches were a rarity, midget wrestling failed to catch on, while women were banned by the Greater London Council until the late 1970s.

=== Explosion (1980–present) ===

During the Golden Age of pro wrestling in the 1980s–1990s, a rise of cartoonish, outlandish gimmicks became popular with the increase of the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s popularity.

The WWF contributed to the explosion of gimmicks by becoming the most colorful and well-known wrestling brand because of its child-oriented characters, soap opera dramatics and cartoon-like personas. Most notable was the muscular Hulk Hogan, who marked the 1980s with his &quot;Real-American&quot; gimmick and made his main events into excellent ratings draws. His dominant role in the industry at that time led to this era to be also known as &quot;Hulkamania&quot;. Around this time, wrestling became a form of entertainment rather than an official sport.

Other wrestlers from this era with similarly vivid and outlandish characterization include The Iron Sheik, The Ultimate Warrior, Randy Savage, The Undertaker, Sting, Goldust, Roddy Piper, Ric Flair, &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; Shawn Michaels, &quot;Big Daddy Cool&quot; Diesel, Kwang, The Bushwhackers, Big Boss Man, Tatanka, Razor Ramon, Sgt. Slaughter, Irwin R. Schyster, among many others.

Beginning with the Ruthless Aggression era following the Attitude era, the emphasis of gimmicks became more realistic with wrestlers portraying themselves or actual people without wild exaggeration, freakishness or fantastical qualities. It is also more common for the wrestlers to use their actual names. Wrestlers like Randy Orton, Batista, Bobby Lashley, John Cena, and Brock Lesnar are prime examples. All the said wrestlers are depicted as less-exaggerated average people.

Although rare, colorful and cartoon-like characters remain in the WWE, such as Shinsuke Nakamura (a wildly random, erratic mixed martial arts enigma, emotionally charged by the sound of violins) and Matt Riddle (a stereotypical carefree, barefoot surfer Valley boy). Outside WWE, some wrestlers have made names for themselves on the crowded independent circuit by adopting absurdist comedy gimmicks intended to be understood by post-kayfabe fans as purely fictional characters. Two such wrestlers whose independent-scene popularity got them noticed and eventually signed by the internationally televised promotion All Elite Wrestling are Orange Cassidy, an emotionless slacker who puts as little effort as possible into his matches and frequently wrestles with his hands in his pockets; and Danhausen, a demonic but somewhat-bumbling figure in horror face paint who claims to be &quot;very nice, very evil&quot; and attempts to put curses on his opponents.

== Common gimmicks ==

===Related to origin===
Exaggerating the characteristics of a wrestler&#x27;s (on occasion fabricated) origin is one of the most commonly exploited gimmicks, in which overarching characteristics of a character play up to clichés and stereotypes.
A long list of wrestlers in this category includes: Arab (The Sheik, The Sultan, Muhammad Hassan), African (Kamala, Abdullah The Butcher, Akeem), American (The Patriot, Hulk Hogan, &#x27;Hacksaw&#x27; Jim Duggan, Jack Swagger), Australian (Outback Jack, Nathan Jones), Austrian (Walter), Bulgarian (Rusev), Canadian (Team Canada (TNA), Team Canada (WCW)), Chinese (Xia Li, Boa), Cuban (Razor Ramon), English (William Regal, Lord Alfred Hayes, Gentleman Jack Gallagher), French/Québécois (La Résistance), German (Fritz Von Erich, Baron von Raschke), Hawaiian (Crush, Leilani Kai), Indian (The Great Khali, Jinder Mahal), Iranian (The Iron Sheik, Ariya Daivari), Irish (Finlay, Sheamus), Italian (Full Blooded Italians, Santino Marella), Jamaican (Kofi Kingston), Japanese (Yokozuna, The Orient Express, Mr. Fuji), Mexican (The Mexicools), Native American (Chief Jay Strongbow, Tatanka), New Zealander (The Sheepherders), Nigerian (Apollo Crews), Pacific Islander (Jimmy Snuka, The Wild Samoans, The Headshrinkers), Puerto Rican (Carlito Colón, Primo and Epico), Polish (Ivan Putski), Russian (Ivan Koloff, Nikolai Volkoff, Lana), Scottish (Drew McIntyre, Roddy Piper) and Swiss (Claudio Castagnoli).

===Masked===
Masked wrestlers made their appearance in Europe (Theobaud Bauer in France, 1865) and the United States (Mort Henderson as &quot;Masked Marvel&quot; in 1915) considerably earlier than in Mexico, but it was the latter that popularised the use of masks. This, in some cases to signify a high-flyer style, influenced by Lucha Libre.

A specific masked gimmick may be used by more than one wrestler at a wrestling company&#x27;s request since their identity can be permanently concealed. This is the case of Mexican Sin Cara and Japanese Tiger Mask. Masks also allow a wrestler to perform as more than one character for a variety of wrestling promotions. In Mexico, a masked wrestler&#x27;s identity is often not even a matter of public record, and being unmasked, usually as a stipulation of losing a match, is considered a great humiliation. It is a major taboo for a Mexican wrestler who has lost his mask to start wearing one again, though this has occasionally been violated, as in the case of Rey Mysterio.

Other wrestlers who have used masks in their performances include: The Masked Superstar, Mexican-American Kalisto, Lince Dorado, Gran Metalik, or Japanese legend Jushin Thunder Liger.

===Sports===
A high number of wrestlers who start their careers in another sport incorporate their athletic abilities as part of their act. That is the case for Olympic medallist Kurt Angle, who previously competed in freestyle wrestling and alludes to it in his attire and wrestling style. Brock Lesnar is also an ex-amateur wrestler, NFL player and UFC champion. Welsh wrestler Mason Ryan is also a former Gladiator and football player. English wrestler Wade Barrett was also a former bare-knuckle fighter as well as Elijah Burke who is also a former amateur boxer. Former MMA fighters Ronda Rousey and Shayna Baszler also uses their MMA background as part of their characters as well as former American Ninja Warrior competitor Kacy Catanzaro, former kung-fu fighter Xia Li, and Matt Riddle, who always wrestles barefooted during matches, presuming that he had an MMA background career in the past before debuting in WWE along with Mojo Rawley&#x27;s &quot;hyperactive&quot; wrestling style due to being a former NFL player before debuting WWE as well as the stable The Four Horsemen.

===Superheroes, supervillains and other comic-based characters===

The theatrical nature of professional wrestling easily blends with comic hero and villain characters, made popular in the 1980s by legend The Ultimate Warrior and Sting, whose character was inspired by the 1994 movie &quot;The Crow&quot;, based on the comic book of the same name.

Other wrestlers with superhero and supervillain gimmicks include late WWE Hall of Famer Dusty Rhodes&#x27; sons Gold and Stardust, Big Van Vader, Bam Bam Bigelow, Pierre Carl Ouellet, Dr. Luther, the magician Phantasio, Icarus, Super Eric, Dexter Lumis, Samoan Rosey during his &quot;the Super Hero in Training&quot; (the S.H.I.T.) phase and his tag-team partner The Hurricane and valet Super Stacy, Earthquake/Avalanche and his tag-team partner Typhoon in The Natural Disasters stable, and tag-teams The Road Warriors, Demolition, KroniK, The Assassins, The Super Assassins, The Machines, and most recently, The Ascension, and The Viking Raiders/War Machine.

Some of these characters are brought during very short periods of time for entertainment value. The Joker and Harley Quinn from the Batman comics have inspired wrestling attire for Sting and Alexa Bliss respectively. Finn Bálor&#x27;s Demon King persona is visually based on Spider-Man villains Venom and Carnage. Sandman&#x27;s character name is also based on Spider-Man villain Sandman as well as Rhyno, whose character name was based on a pun on the Spider-Man villain Rhino. Raven&#x27;s character name was based on DC Comics superhero, Raven. Kenny Omega&#x27;s taunts were inspired by video games since he was a big fan of them. Mantaur&#x27;s character name was also based on a pun on the word Minotaur, a half-man, half-bull creature from Greek Mythology. Luchasaurus&#x27; character name is a portmanteau of &quot;lucha libre&quot; and &quot;dinosaurus&quot;. Tag-team The Super Smash Brothers&#x27;s name was based on the video game franchise &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; Nikki Cross also changed her gimmick and name like that of a superhero, into Nikki A.S.H. (Almost a Superhero). TNA&#x27;s Dean Roll&#x27;s ring name, Shark Boy, became the inspiration for the 3D film, &quot;The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D&quot;.

===Supernatural-based characters===
Similarly to superheroes and supervillains, supernatural characters add to entertainment value. Most famously in this category is The Undertaker, considered one of the most respected wrestlers in the business, whose gimmick is a horror-themed character of an undead, macabre and paranormal dark presence prone to scare tactics. He was managed by the ghostly character that was Paul Bearer and tagged with his half-brother Kane in The Brothers of Destruction stable.

Other wrestlers displaying supposed supernatural powers include Matt Hardy (as his Broken/Woken persona), and his younger brother Jeff Hardy (as his Brother Nero/Willow character), Mordecai, Waylon Mercy, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts, Papa Shango, The Boogeyman, Abyss, and most recently Asuka, Aleister Black, and Bray Wyatt&#x27;s The Fiend, and stables The Three Faces of Fear, and The Dungeon of Doom. Japanese Onryo portrays a dead wrestler who returned for vengeance.

Raven was the leader of five stables; Raven&#x27;s Nest, The Flock, The Dead Pool, The Gathering, and Serotonin.

The Brood was a vampire stable, composed of Gangrel, Christian and Edge.

Alexa Bliss was also given a different gimmick after her alliance with Bray Wyatt in late 2020s, appearing suddenly and sometimes attacking the other wrestlers, the same things that Bray Wyatt would do.

===Juggernaut===
Since its beginnings in the circus circuit, the professional wrestler&#x27;s stereotype has been that of large, powerful and strong, most notably Kane upon his arrival to the WWF/E. Various wrestlers have banked on the larger size which has influenced their in-ring style and persona.

Notable examples of these kind include Swede Tor Johnson (181 kg), Gorilla Monsoon (182 kg), Giant González (8 ft 0 in), André the Giant (7 ft 4 in), The Great Khali (7 ft 3 in), Big Show (7 ft 2 in), Awesome Kong and Nia Jax (123 kg).

===Midget===

Similarly to juggernauts, since its beginnings in the circus circuit, the professional wrestler&#x27;s stereotype has been that of small, but powerful and strong like those of dwarves of Norse mythology. Various wrestlers have banked on the small size which has influenced their in-ring style and persona.

Notable examples of these kind include the leprechaun Hornswoggle, El Torito and other various dwarfed versions of other various wrestlers.

===Educational===
Education is a rare gimmick in wrestling due to the fact that, most times, the wrestler is a former real-life student or scholar of a school, a college, a university, or a TAFE, who also worked as a cheerleader, a coach, a dean, a librarian, a teacher, or even a principal. Wrestlers who used this gimmick include NXT wrestlers, e.g. Alex Riley etc., Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan, Sgt. Slaughter, Dean Douglas, Jonathan Coachman, Michelle McCool&#x27;s &quot;sexy teacher&quot; character, The Miz&#x27;s and Jack Swagger&#x27;s &quot;student&quot; amateur background characters, Damien Sandow&#x27;s &quot;Intellectual Savior of the Unwashed Masses&quot; character, and &quot;The Librarian&quot; Peter Avalon and his manager Leva Bates, and tag-teams The Steiner Brothers, The Spirit Squad, and most recently, Team Rhodes Scholars, American Alpha, and Chase University.

===Bad News reporter===
Bad News reporter characters are a villainous gimmick; due to any &quot;bad news&quot; reported to the fans by a &quot;bad guy&quot; (heel); but is quite rare since that fans are not quite interested in it either. Wrestlers who used this gimmick include Bad News Brown, and most recently, &quot;Bad News&quot; Barrett.

===Religious===
Religion is often a rare gimmick in professional wrestling due to its controversial nature. Wrestlers who used this gimmick include Friar Ferguson, and most recently, &quot;Bolieve&quot; Bo Dallas, and &quot;The Monday Night Messiah&quot; Seth &quot;Freakin&#x27;&quot; Rollins.

===Hardcore technician===

Whilst being way beyond over the limit from some sheer violence is scary in some matches, hardcore technician gimmicks are also another popular choice for gimmicks, due to the fans being over with getting used to watching sheer violence as they don&#x27;t shy away from it either. These include Abdullah the Butcher, and Bruiser Brody, which came popular into other professional wrestling companies like ECW wrestlers, e.g. Terry Funk, Hardcore Holly, New Jack, and Mick Foley/Mankind/Cactus Jack, etc., CZW wrestlers, e.g. John Zandig, Necro Butcher, Wifebeater, Nick Mondo, and Nick Gage, etc., AEW wrestlers, e.g. The Blade and The Butcher, etc., Japanese Wrestlers Atsushi Onita, Toshiaki Kawada, and Jun Kasai, and tag-teams The Motor City Machine Guns, and most recently, The Mechanics, and Heavy Machinery.

===Music-based characters===
Music influences are another popular choice for gimmicks. In the 80&#x27;s, The Honky Tonk Man worked with a Elvisesque character. Elias also works well with his musician guitar character. Rapping was demonstrated by R-Truth/K-Kwik&#x27;s original rapper character along with Road Dogg and John Cena worked during the first years of his career with a rapper gimmick. AEW tag team The Acclaimed also begin each of their matches with a different rap. Other music genre types were demonstrated by CM Punk&#x27;s straight edge iconoclast hardcore punk, party boys No Way Jose and Adam Rose, Cameron Grimes, Rick Boogs, Rockstar Spud, Heath Slater, Lance Archer, Chris Jericho, Jeff Jarrett, Marty Jannetty, The Honky Tonk Man, Disco Inferno, One Man Gang, Buck Zumhofe, WWE&#x27;s Brodus Clay and his fun-loving, funk dancing gimmick &quot;The Funkasaurus&quot; and Fandango who includes salsa dancing in his routine, and AEW&#x27;s Jack Evans who usually does breakdancing in the ring during entrances or when he&#x27;s won a match, and tag-teams The Public Enemy, Badd Company, The Rockers, The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express, The Rhythm and Blues, and most recently, The Vaudevillains. AEW&#x27;s Adam Williams is also a professional wrestler and a real-life guitarist.

===Comedy===

Whilst humor has long been present in professional wrestling matches and many wrestlers incorporate elements of comedy in their act, full-on comedic gimmicks are not commonly seen. These are sometimes reserved for wrestlers who not always have the stereotypical physique required in the industry and instead exploit their entertainment abilities.

Initiated by English wrestler Les Kellett, wrestlers who fall under this category are Doink The Clown which was majorly portrayed by Matt Osborne until his death in 2013, which inspired others like Scottish comedian and actor Grado, Ring of Honor&#x27;s Colt Cabana, Santino Marella, James Ellsworth, and Eugene&#x27;s &quot;mentally disabled boy&quot; character, Japanese Wrestlers Stalker Ichikawa, Gran Naniwa, Kuishinbo Kamen and Toru Yano, Charlie Haas during his impersonations run, and WWE&#x27;s 1990s turkey character Gobbledy Gooker, and rooster character Red Rooster, WCW&#x27;s Brian Pillman, and Al Snow along with his mannequin prop called &quot;Head&quot; which he used as a sidekick companion during segments while addressing the fans. And recently, The New Day pursued a joyous gimmick, giving them a character heavily associated with the fans. Damien Sandow also falls under this category due to his &#x27;stunt double&#x27; gimmick in late 2014 where he copied whatever his on-screen mentor The Miz did, due to the latter using a gimmick of an arrogant movie star. R-Truth also influenced his character with some of his comedic activities, such as breaking out a joke, dancing and finding out his opponent to win the 24/7 Championship in a strange and funny way.

===Charity===
Characters who do charity are depicted as a heroic gimmick due to real-life charity. Wrestlers who used this gimmick include Sweet Daddy Siki, Brother Love, &quot;Make a Difference&quot; Fatu, Dude Love, and most recently, &quot;The Doctor of Hug-o-nomics&quot; Bayley, and tag-team Men on a Mission.

===Self-absorbed===
Usually a villainous gimmick, initiated by Gorgeous George, due to the jealousy of the good looks the fans want to have for themselves. Wrestlers that followed on with this trend include Sonny Kiss, Angel Garza, &quot;The Untouchable&quot; Carmella, Lana with her catchphrase, &quot;I am the best in the world&quot;, &quot;Dashing&quot; Cody Rhodes, &quot;The Black Machismo&quot; Jay Lethal, &quot;The Artist Collective&quot; Sami Zayn, &quot;The Masterpiece&quot; Chris Masters, Byron Saxton, &quot;The Swiss Superman&quot; Antonio Cesaro, Dolph Ziggler with his &quot;perfection&quot; gimmick, The Miz with his catchphrase, &quot;AWESOME&quot;, Randy Orton, &quot;The Glamazon&quot; Beth Phoenix, Carlito Caribbean Cool, &quot;The Phenominal&quot; AJ Styles, &quot;Glorious&quot; Bobby Roode, &quot;The Almighty&quot; Bobby Lashley, &quot;The Golden Standard&quot; Shelton Benjamin, Scotty 2 Hotty, &quot;The Rated R Superstar&quot; Edge, The &quot;Great One&quot; Rock, &quot;The World&#x27;s Strongest Man&quot; Mark Henry, Val Venis, &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; Shawn Michaels, &quot;Big Sexy&quot; Kevin Nash, Lex Luger&#x27;s &quot;The Narcissist&quot; character, &quot;Beautiful&quot; Bobby Eaton, Ravishing Rick Rude, &quot;The Model&quot; Rick Martel, &quot;Adorable&quot; Adrian Adonis, Hulk Hogan, &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura, &quot;The Nature Boy&quot; Ric Flair and his daughter, &quot;Handsome&quot; Harley Race, &quot;Classy&quot; Freddie Blassie, AEW&#x27;s &quot;Pretty&quot; Peter Avalon, and Powerhouse Hobbs, TNA&#x27;s Mr Pec-tacular, Brian Christopher&#x27;s Grand Master Sexay, Billy Gunn&#x27;s Mr Ass, Curt Hennig&#x27;s Mr Perfect, Paul Orndorff&#x27;s Mr Wonderful, NXT&#x27;s Tyler Breeze, Lacey Evans, and &quot;The Finest&quot; Kona Reeves, and tag-teams The Mexicools, and Too Cool, as well as women&#x27;s tag-teams The Beautiful People, LayCool, Fire and Desire, and The IIconics.

===Hollywood movie star===
Hollywood movie stars are occasionally villainous due to fame outside of wrestling as a real-life Hollywood actor/actress. These include &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan, The Rock, and most recently, Batista, John Cena, The Miz, and David Otunga&#x27;s A-list character, and tag-teams The Hollywood Blondes, and MNM, and most recently, The Bollywood Boyz, despite being of Indian descent and being billed from the famous Indian filming district of Bollywood, Mumbai (Bombay), instead which they were named after (although the name &quot;Bollywood&quot; was borrowed from the word &quot;Hollywood&quot; but with a &quot;B&quot; instead of a &quot;H&quot; to describe a famous filming district in Mumbai (Bombay), in India, which it was named after).

===Authority figure-based characters===
Authority figures are apparently villainous but sometimes as heroic characters as wrestlers and non-wrestlers (e.g. referees, general managers, security, police, etc.) as well depending on the storyline. Some wrestlers also use a character based on an authority over other people. These include non-wrestlers like managers, and wrestlers like The Mountie, Big Boss Man, &quot;The Alpha Male&quot; Marcus Cor Von, Consequences Creed, &quot;The Man&quot; Becky Lynch, &quot;The Boss&quot; Sasha Banks, Sean O&#x27;Haire&#x27;s devil advocate gimmick, and David Otunga&#x27;s legal adviser character, ECW&#x27;s 911, and stables New World Order, Right to Censor, The Truth Commission, The Acolytes Protection Agency, 3-Minute Warning, and most recently, The Authors of Pain, The Shield, and The Authority.

===Money-based characters (Evil billionaire/Millionaire tyrant)===
The evil billionaire/millionaire tyrant character works well as a villain — due to the jealousy of the fans who want the things &quot;money can&#x27;t buy&quot; for themselves which they can&#x27;t afford — in contrast to professional wrestling&#x27;s working-class fan-base. It is because of this audience that Dusty Rhodes&#x27; &quot;Common Man&quot; or &quot;American Dream&quot; was highly successful with the crowds.

The original gimmick of this type was created by &quot;Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase, which consequently inspired wrestlers like his son, which includes being owners of the promotion, like Mr. McMahon and his family (including his son and daughter (since they are the real owners of WWE)), and most recently, &quot;The Dream&quot; Velveteen Dream, and stables The Diamond Exchange, The Beverly Brothers, The Million Dollar Corporation, Money Inc., Beer Money, Inc., and most recently, The Prime Time Players, The Street Profits, and The Hurt Business. JBL used his real-life work as Wall Street investor as base for his JBL character.

===Ruthless ruler===
Similarly to evil billionaire/millionaire tyrant characters, and even authority figures, ruthless ruler characters are mostly a villainous gimmick based on real-life royals, imperials, empires, monarchs, or around other non-royal characters, like bureaucrats, aristocrats, diplomats, nobles, and gents. Wrestlers who originally used this gimmick include Lord Alfred Hayes, which inspired others like Baron von Raschke, &quot;King&quot; James Valiant, The Duke of Dorchester, Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler, The Sultan, King Booker, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, Prince Nana, Tiger Ali Singh&#x27;s rich and arrogant Asiatic heir character and his manservant Babu, William Regal&#x27;s arrogant royal noble English ambassador character and his manager Sir William, and most recently, Dalton Castle, Gentleman Jack Gallagher, Baron Corbin who uses the gimmick of a villainous and an evil king, after winning the 2019 king of the ring tournament, but lost to Shinsuke Nakamura who is using the gimmick like that of the Japanese emperor after winning the &quot;Battle For The Crown&quot; against Corbin, Roman Reigns who is using the gimmick of the head of the table and the tribal chief, representing his tribe, upon his heel turn, Jinder Mahal as the Modern Maharaja, associating with his Indian ancestry, Apollo Crews as a proud representative of Nigeria, and Alberto Del Rio&#x27;s arrogant rich Mexican aristocrat character and his personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez, and stables The Nation of Domination, The Kings of Wrestling, The British Invasion, The British Bulldogs, The Blue Bloods, Los Conquistadores, and most recently, The Kingdom, The Undisputed Era, and The Imperium.

===Hated crime gang/Terrorist thugs/Bad guy bandits/Mafia mobsters===
Hated crime gangsters, terrorist thugs, bad guy bandits, mafia mobsters etc. all work well as a villainous gimmick due to real-life crime gangs, terrorists, bandits, and mobsters, but has also become a more popular gimmick among heroes, partially due to being over with fans who seem to be more malevolent towards the heels, even if the later are trying to be friendly or polite. These include Razor Ramon, The Brooklyn Brawler, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Eddie Guerrero and Chavo Guerrero with their catchphrase, &quot;I lie, I cheat, I steal&quot;/&quot;We lie, We cheat, We steal&quot;, &quot;Brutal&quot; Bob Evans, Beer City Bruiser, Shannon Moore, John Cena&#x27;s &quot;thug nature&quot; character, and most recently, Eddie Edwards, Sami Callihan, Darby Allin, Hikaru Shida (with her yakuza gimmick), and Bandido, and tag-teams Cryme Tyme, D-Generation X, The New Age Outlaws, The Disciples of Apocalypse, The Gangstas/The Gangstanators, FBI, LAX, Mexican America, La Familia, The Forever Hooligans, and most recently, Riott Squad, The Forgotten Sons, Social Outcasts, Enzo Amore and Big Cass, Sanity, Aces &amp; Eights, The Bullet Club, and Retribution.

<doc id="557713" wikidata="Q3274644" url="?curid=557713" title="Macintosh Programmer's Workshop">
<text>Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop (MPW) is a software development environment for the Classic Mac OS operating system, written by Apple Computer. For Macintosh developers, it was one of the primary tools for building applications for System 7.x and Mac OS 8.x and 9.x. Initially MPW was available for purchase as part of Apple&#x27;s professional developers program, but Apple made it a free download after it was superseded by CodeWarrior. On Mac OS X it was replaced by the Project Builder IDE, which eventually became Xcode.

== Design ==

MPW provided a command line environment and tools, including 68k and PowerPC assemblers as well as Pascal, C and C++ compilers. The shell environment is somewhat similar to Unix shells in design, but is designed around the Macintosh&#x27;s character set and GUI, replacing the usual terminal environment with a &quot;worksheet&quot; interface, allowing the user to select and run arbitrary sections of a shell script or to redo commands with no retyping. In addition, command line tools were commonly provided with a somewhat standardized graphical interface named Commando that provided limited access to the command line capabilities of the program. The debuggers were not integrated into MPW like most IDEs of today but the language compilers supported the symbolic debugging information file format used by the debugger. MPW supported a source-level debugger called SADE (Symbolic Application Debugging Environment). SADE was not an MPW Tool, but ran as a separate application with a user interface similar to MPW.

Apple&#x27;s compilers had some features that were not common on other platforms—for example, the Pascal compiler was object-oriented, while the C and C++ compilers included support for length-prefixed strings (needed for Pascal-oriented APIs).

Pascal was Apple&#x27;s original preferred language for Macintosh software development, and MPW was initially released with only Pascal support. A C compiler was released with MPW 2.0. The MPW C compiler was written under contract for Apple by Greenhills, a Macintosh-variant of the Green Hills C compiler designed specially for Apple and which was similar to the version that was available for the Lisa Workshop. In addition, the original MPW C compiler was known for its casual and frequently humorous error messages (&quot;we already did this function&quot;), as well as occasionally addressing users by name. These quirks were not carried on after the PowerPC transition, when Apple replaced the originals with compilers written by Symantec. Pascal support was no longer provided by the mid-90s due to declining popularity of the language.
MPW was always targeted to a professional audience and was seldom used by hobbyist developers due to the considerable price for the package; by the time it was made freeware it had long since been superseded by offerings from Symantec and Metrowerks, as well as Apple&#x27;s own development tools inherited from NeXT and distributed for free with OS X. It was also occasionally available as a wrapper environment for third-party compilers, a practice used by both Metrowerks and Absoft among others. Apple has officially discontinued further development of MPW and the last version of OS X to run it is 10.4 &#x27;Tiger&#x27;, the last one to support the Classic environment. Apple maintained a web site and mailing lists that supported the software long after its discontinuation, but that site now redirects to the Xcode page.

==MPW Shell==
The MPW Shell featured redirection of output to files, as well as to windows. If a file was open, the output would go to the file and to the open window. This redirection of output required significant patching out of the file system calls so that tools need not do anything special to inherit this feature: the MPW Shell did all of the work.

The MPW Shell command language was based on the Unix csh language, but was extended to support the main features of the Macintosh GUI. It had simple commands to create menus, dialogs (prompts), and new shell windows. The cursor could be controlled, and MPW scripts or tools could easily be attached to a menu item. Command key shortcuts could be specified. Window size and location could be controlled. These features were popular in commercial production environments, where complicated build and packaging processes were all controlled by elaborate scripts.

The shell had some important differences from its Unix counterparts. For instance, the classic Mac OS had nothing comparable to Unix fork(), so MPW tools were effectively called as subroutines of the shell; only one could be running at any one time, and tools could not themselves run other tools. These limitations were the inspiration for the MacRelix project, a &quot;Unix-like system&quot; for classic Mac OS.

===Look and feel===
Functionally, a &quot;worksheet&quot; is a cross between a text editor document and an xterm window. Each worksheet window is persistently bound to a file. The user may type anything anywhere in the window, including commands, which can be executed via the keyboard&#x27;s Enter key; command output appears at the insertion point. Unlike an xterm window, an MPW worksheet is always in visual editing mode and can be freely reorganized by its user. Hence a worksheet can be purely a command script or purely a text document or a mixture of the two—an integrated document describing the history, maintenance procedures and test results of a software project. The commercial BBEdit text editor retains a feature it calls &quot;shell worksheets&quot; on Mac OS X. The Emacs text editor provides shell buffers, a similar feature that works across platforms.

==Other tools==
MPW included a version of make. Its syntax was conceptually similar to that of Unix make, but used the MacRoman long f character to indicate dependencies. More significantly, since the limitations of the shell precluded the make program from running tools itself, it had to work by composing a script of compile/link actions to be run, then delivering that to the shell for execution. While this was good enough most of the time, it precluded makefiles that could make on-the-fly decisions based on the results of a previous action.

Although not implemented as MPW tools, the package also came with several source-level debuggers through its history; SourceBug and SADE (Symbolic Application Debugging Environment) were used on MC680x0 systems, while the Power Mac Debugger (known during development as R2Db) provided both local and remote debugging services for PowerPC systems, the latter by using a server program known as a &quot;debugger nub&quot; on the computer being debugged.

==Writing MPW tools==
MPW included a set of standard C libraries sufficient for developers to build their own MPW tools. Many Unix utilities could be ported with little change. One point of difficulty was the Mac OS newline convention, which was different from Unix. Another was the pathname separator, &quot;:&quot; in Mac OS, but many Unix utilities assumed &quot;/&quot;. Many Unix utilities also assumed pathnames would not have embedded spaces, a common practice on Macs.

For a number of years, the GNU toolchain included portability support for MPW as part of libiberty. This was used to support MPW-hosted cross-compilers used by General Magic and several other developers.

==History==
MPW was started in late 1985 by Rick Meyers, Jeff Parrish, and Dan Smith (now Dan Keller). It was going to be called the Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s System, or MPS. (Notice that coincidentally the three last names start with MPS.) &#x27;MPS &#x27; has always been the creator signature of the MPW Shell as a result of this. Since MPW was to be the successor to the Lisa Workshop, they decided to rename it the Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop. Before the arrival of MPW, Mac applications had to be cross-developed on a Lisa.

The MPW Pascal compiler is descended from the Lisa Pascal compiler. Apple&#x27;s Larry Tesler worked with Niklaus Wirth to come up with Object Pascal extensions which Ken Doyle incorporated in one of the last versions of the Lisa Pascal compiler. This enabled MacApp.

Early contributors included Rick Meyers (project lead and MPW Shell command interpreter), Jeff Parrish (MPW Shell editor), Dan Smith (MPW Shell commands), Ira Ruben (assembler and many of the tools including Backup, PasMat, and more), Fred Forsman (Make, Print, SADE, and assembler macro processor), Al Hoffman (Pascal compiler) Roger Lawrence (Pascal and C compilers, including the error messages), Ken Friedenbach (linker), Johan Strandberg (Rez, DeRez, RezDet), Steve Hartwell (C libraries), and Dan Allen (MacsBug, editor). The Apple Numerics Group also contributed math libraries.

MPW 1.0 was completed on September 24, 1986. A shell memory leak was fixed on October 10, 1986, and MPW 1.0.1 was born. MPW 2.0 was completed on July 20, 1987. MPW 3.0 was done November 30, 1988 and included a completely new C compiler. Around the same time, the beta version of the C++ compiler as well as MacApp 2.0 (for Object Pascal) were made available. MPW 3.1 and 3.2 came in the next few years, with MPW 3.3 released in May 1993, adding distributed tools support and incremental linking. MPW 3.4 was completed July 14, 1995, and MPW 3.5 was done December 17, 1999. MPW 3.6 was under development when work was halted in late 2001.

During MPW&#x27;s twilight years, Greg Branche supported MPW unofficially through the Apple MPW-dev mailing list. The list, and the lists.apple.com server that hosted it, was planned to be shut down January 17, 2014, a decision that was later reversed.

==Legacy==
MPW can still be used to develop for Mac OS X, but support is limited to Carbon applications for PowerPC-based computers. To develop Mac OS X applications based on other technologies, one must use either Xcode or another OS X-compatible development environment. MPW also included a version control system called Projector; this has been superseded by modern version control systems and is no longer supported in Mac OS X.

<doc id="557714" wikidata="Q1755342" url="?curid=557714" title="His 'n' Hers">
<text>His &#x27;n&#x27; Hers is the fourth studio album by English rock band Pulp, released on 18 April 1994 by Island Records. It proved to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, reaching number nine on the UK Albums Chart, and was nominated for the 1994 Mercury Music Prize. In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; magazine readers voted it the seventieth greatest album of all time, while it was placed at number 110 in the book &quot;Virgin All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Themes and content==
Lyrically, the album encompasses subjects for which Pulp were to become well known, including sexual encounters, social class and voyeurism.

Robyn Strachan retrospectively describes the opener &quot;Joyriders&quot; as setting the tone for the album with &quot;acerbic observation and lurking seediness and decay&quot;.

&quot;She&#x27;s a Lady&quot; takes much of its musical inspiration from Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.

The album closer, &quot;David&#x27;s Last Summer&quot;, is notable as being one of Pulp&#x27;s most narrative songs, delivered entirely in spoken word apart from the chorus despite being an uptempo track.

==Release and aftermath==

The CD edition of the album included a new remixed version of the song “Babies”, the original version of which was previously released as a single in 1992.

The album was preceded with two singles: &quot;Lipgloss&quot; and &quot;Do You Remember the First Time?&quot;. The new mix of &quot;Babies&quot; was also released as a single as part of the &quot;Sisters EP&quot;.

The album was a long-awaited breakthrough for Pulp in the UK becoming their first charting album reaching #9 and later certified Gold.

A CD Deluxe edition of &quot;His &#x27;n&#x27; Hers&quot; was released on 11 September 2006. It contained a second disc of B-sides, demos and rarities. The vinyl version of the Deluxe edition was released in 2012.

<text>Jonathan &quot;Jack&quot; Donahue Bristow, played by Victor Garber, is a fictional character of the ABC television series &quot;Alias&quot;. He is the father of the central character Sydney Bristow, played by Jennifer Garner.

For playing the character, Garber received critical acclaim and three consecutive nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, among other accolades.

==Character biography==
Jack Bristow, a longtime agent of the CIA and former double officer with SD-6, is often emotionally distant and can be among the show&#x27;s coldest and most brutal characters. However, his character&#x27;s defining trait is his devotion to the safety of his daughter, Sydney. He is highly protective of her and is willing to do anything - torture, kill, even betray his country - to ensure her well-being. His relationship with his daughter has always been problematic, although it warmed and matured as the show unfolded. According to background information provided in the official &quot;Alias&quot; magazine, Jack Bristow is originally from Canada (reflecting the fact that actor Victor Garber is Canadian). A screenshot in a fourth-season episode showed a laptop referring to his birth in London, Ontario. Jack&#x27;s granddaughter Isabelle was also born in Canada, on a mission in Vancouver.

Prior to the events of the series, Jack fathered Sydney with Irina Derevko, a long-term KGB spy who married Jack to get close to the CIA, specifically to steal the details of Project Christmas, which Jack was developing for the Agency. She took the name Laura Bristow and built a cover as an English literature professor. Once the FBI started to investigate against Irina, she faked her death in a staged car accident. Jack, suspected of being complicit in Irina&#x27;s espionage, was detained and placed in solitary confinement. He named Arvin and Emily Sloane as Sydney&#x27;s guardians. Jack and Arvin became friends after they got to know each other in the early seventies, when both started their careers at the CIA. When Jack was finally cleared, he began drinking heavily and became more of an absentee father, leaving Sydney to be raised by nannies. About ten years later, Jack was recruited into SD-6 by Sloane when the Alliance of Twelve was founded, and was one of the few agents who knew the truth behind the cell. He was also Director of Operations at SD-6, and many in the Alliance believed he was a logical choice to take Sloane&#x27;s place.

When Sydney was in college, Arvin Sloane had her recruited into SD-6 without Jack&#x27;s knowledge. Jack reacted negatively to Sydney&#x27;s telling him that she had gotten a job at Credit Dauphine, the front company for SD-6. However, Jack&#x27;s reaction made Sydney more determined to be a part of the &quot;CIA&quot;. Jack later revealed to Sydney that he had recognized her potential, but wanted to keep her away from this life, away from making the choices that he had to and eventually she had to as an agent. Sydney&#x27;s recruitment into SD-6 also ended Jack&#x27;s friendship with Sloane, although, because of the clandestine nature of Jack&#x27;s work as a double-agent at SD-6, he couldn&#x27;t reveal that to Sloane until years after.

Several years later when Sydney herself becomes a double agent for the real CIA, she discovers that her father has long been in the same position and they learn to work together to bring down SD-6. Jack often used his position as Sloane&#x27;s chief of operations to structure missions to the CIA&#x27;s advantage. When Irina Derevko makes her reappearance in Season 2, Jack must also deal with his unresolved feelings of love and bitterness towards her while continuing to perform his job at SD-6 and the CIA. With SD-6&#x27;s destruction, Jack found himself finally able to grow closer to his daughter.

Sydney learns in season 2 that Jack subjected her to Project Christmas, a project that trained and hardwired potential spies. Sydney initially believed that this programming had taken away her choices in life, but in Season 3 discovers that it had, in fact, protected her autonomy and made her immune to brainwashing by the Covenant. During Sydney&#x27;s two year disappearance between Seasons 2 and 3, Jack was again taken into custody, held in solitary confinement for a year because of his working with unsanctioned sources (including Irina) to learn the truth behind Sydney&#x27;s apparent death. During Season 3, Jack acts as a far more supportive father-figure to Sydney, in response to her depression and emotional isolation during that season.

At the start of Season 4, Sydney learns that Jack killed Irina. Even though he did it because Irina had hired a hit man to kill Sydney, his action causes yet another rift to form between Jack and his daughter, a rift aggravated when both agents are recruited by Sloane into the new CIA black ops agency, Authorized Personnel Only (APO). By the second half of the season, this rift has begun to heal.

Jack Bristow contracts radiation poisoning during the events of the fourth-season episode &quot;Nightingale&quot; when he entered a radioactive area in order to save Sydney&#x27;s life during a mission. He initially keeps his condition a secret from his APO colleagues except for Marshall (who figures it out and confronts Jack, although Marshall later revealed it to Sydney). Bristow is seen consulting with a doctor who tells him the condition is terminal. Not accepting this prognosis, Jack begins a painful regimen of blood filtering treatments in order to delay the inevitable, and appeared to be experiencing memory loss related to medication; he is also puzzled by the appearance of a mysterious implant in his hand, which his doctor said was designed to regulate the anti-radiation medication.

Jack&#x27;s doctor and indeed his entire treatment regimen turn out to be hallucinations, and that Jack, his mind affected by the radiation, had been injecting himself with a poison. Further investigation by APO reveals that the hallucinated doctor actually exists. He was a scientist who had developed an experimental treatment for radiation sickness. In the early 1980s, Jack had helped the man escape to Scandinavia. Sydney impersonates Irina to get Jack to reveal the doctor&#x27;s whereabouts; the man is located and begins a genuine treatment regimen for Jack. During the impersonation, Sydney learned that her father had planned to leave the CIA in order to be a better parent to her and would have done so if her mother had not been revealed as a KGB agent. This did much to assuage Sydney&#x27;s longstanding concerns about her importance in her father&#x27;s life.

Jack learns near the end of the fourth season that he had not in fact killed Irina, but had shot a genetically engineered impostor. He subsequently reunited with Irina, who chastised him for being so quick to rush to judgment about her, yet also said that she understood why he had acted to protect Sydney. Following Irina&#x27;s help in foiling the end game of her sister Elena, Jack decides to let Irina go rather than return her to federal prison. Husband and wife parted with a kiss.

In Season 5, Sydney is expecting her first child. In the absence of Michael Vaughn, the child&#x27;s father, Jack attends doctor&#x27;s visits with Sydney and helps her to assemble a crib for his grandchild&#x27;s nursery. However, he is distracted by the presence of Arvin Sloane within APO, a presence he (as the new director of the black ops unit) has authorized; Sloane&#x27;s behavior appears dishonest, and although Sloane has admitted some of his lies, Jack remains on his guard.

Jack becomes a grandfather when Irina and he assist Sydney in delivering her daughter, Isabelle.

In the final episode, Jack, Vaughn (recently returned from hiding) and Sydney mount an assault on Rambaldi&#x27;s tomb in Mongolia where Sloane is in the process of activating The Horizon. Jack and Vaughn are captured by Sark, and when Sydney refuses to surrender The Horizon, Sloane shoots Jack. In retaliation, Sydney shoots Sloane, apparently to death.

Critically wounded, Jack is taken outside and insists that Sydney leave him and go to Hong Kong in order to stop the final player in Rambaldi&#x27;s endgame - Irina - and his daughter reluctantly obeys. Later, he somehow obtains a belt of explosives and struggles back into the tomb, where Sloane, who has apparently become immortal, has been revived. Telling Sloane, &quot;You beat death, Arvin. But you couldn&#x27;t beat &quot;me&quot;&quot;, Jack detonates the explosives, killing himself, sealing the tomb and burying Sloane alive.

The episode ends with a flash forward in which Sydney and Vaughn, several years in the future, have named their second child Jack in his honor.

==Reception==
In 2004, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked him # 29 on its &quot;50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time&quot; list.

<text>Jacques de La Palice (or de La Palisse) (1470 – 24 February 1525) was a French nobleman and military officer. He was the lord of Chabannes, La Palice, Pacy, Chauverothe, Bort-le-Comte and Héron. In 1511, he received the title of Grand Master of France.

As a Marshal under Francis I, he fought against Habsburg armies, and died during the battle of Pavia.

==Biography==
He was born at Lapalisse, Auvergne.

At 15, La Palice entered the service of King Charles VIII of France, of his same age. His first battle was that of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier (1488). Four years later he married Jeanne de Montbéron, daughter of chamberlain Eustache de Montbéron. In 1494 he followed the king in war for the Kingdom of Naples, taking part in the latter city&#x27;s capture in 1495, as well as in the battle of Fornovo (1498) against the Italian League, which allowed the French army to retreat in their homeland.

After Charles&#x27; death, La Palice accompanied the new King, Louis XII, in the campaign for Milan, which the French captured in 1499. He conquered several lands in the Abruzzi and in Apulia, being created viceroy of Abruzzo in 1502. However, he was defeated in the battle of Ruvo di Puglia (1503) and made prisoner by Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. He was freed in 1504, the same year his wife died.

In 1507 he commanded the French vanguard in the siege of Genoa, during which he was seriously wounded. In 1509 the war of the League of Cambrai against the Republic of Venice broke out. La Palice took part in the siege of Treviglio and in the victorious battle of Agnadello; he was then made commander-in-chief of the French troops in Lombardy and, sent to help Emperor Maximilian I, he took part against the Venetians in the unsuccessful siege of Padua in 1509. In 1511, after Charles d&#x27;Amboise&#x27;s death, La Palice became the French overall commander in Italy and was made Grand Master of France.

After Gaston de Foix&#x27;s arrival to Italy, La Palice was put under him, successfully relieving Bologna from the Spanish&#x27;s siege. He took part in the battle of Ravenna (1512), in which de Foix died, being succeeded by La Palice himself as French commander-in-chief. However his slow actions allowed the defeated enemies to recover and expel the French from Lombardy.

Returning to France, he was sent to the Pyrenees to rescue John III of Navarre, but soon he was diverted to Thérouanne, then the last French possession in the Artois, to counter the English troops. On 6 August 1513, he was defeated and made prisoner at the Battle of the Spurs. After John III&#x27;s parallel defeat, this marked the end of Louis XII&#x27;s expansionism. La Palice was dismissed, and retired to his lands, where, in 1514, he married Marie de Melun, who gave him four children.

Louis&#x27;s successor, Francis I, gave him back the title of Grand Master, adding that of Marshal of France on 2 January 1515. La Palice, under the command of Marshal Aubigny, took part to the invasion of Piedmont and the capture of Prospero Colonna in Villafranca, and was one of Francis&#x27; lieutenants at the battle of Marignano. After the signing of the Treaty of Noyon which ended the war, La Palice returned to France.

La Palice was sent at Calais as negotiator of the peace with Charles V. As the participants did not reach an agreement, he returned to Italy as military leader under Marshal Lautrec, commanding the French main line at the battle of Bicocca (1522), in which he was defeated by Colonna. La Palice was sent again to the Pyrenees, and then to the successful attempt to rescue Marseille from Duke of Bourbon&#x27;s siege. After the conquest of Avignon, he moved to Milan which had been abandoned by the Spaniards. On 28 October 1524, at the side of his King, La Palice began the siege of Pavia, defended by Antonio de Leyva. When the Imperial-Spanish army arrived, the battle of Pavia began (24 February 1525). La Palice was captured by German &quot;Landsknechte&quot; during the fighting, and was executed some time later.

==&quot;Lapalissade&quot;==

La Palice gave his name to the &quot;Lapalissade&quot;, a comical truism. The coinage originates from la Palice&#x27;s epitaph, which reads
:&quot;Ci-gît le Seigneur de La Palice: s&#x27;il n&#x27;était pas mort, il ferait encore envie.&quot;
:(&quot;Here lies the Seigneur de La Palice: If he weren&#x27;t dead, he would still be envied.&quot;)
These words were misread (accidentally or intentionally) as &quot;...il ſerait [serait] encore en vie&quot; (&quot;...he would still be alive&quot;), where the long s favours the confusion. In the 16th century this misreading was incorporated into a popular satirical song, and in time many other variants developed. In the early 18th century Bernard de la Monnoye collected over 50 of these humorous &quot;La Palice&quot; quatrains, and published them as a burlesque Song of La Palice. From that song came the French term &quot;&quot; meaning an utterly obvious truth—i.e. a truism or tautology.

<text>Meldreth is a village and civil parish in South Cambridgeshire, England, located around south-west of Cambridge. At the 2011 Census, the population of the parish was 1,783.

==History==
A large Bronze Age hoard was found near Meldreth railway station in the nineteenth century that is now in the collections of the British Museum.
The village of Meldreth grew in Saxon times, and the parish is home to Mettle Hill (formerly known as &quot;Motlowehyll&quot;) that was probably the original meeting place of Armingford Hundred.

Listed as &quot;Melrede&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, the village&#x27;s name means &quot;mill stream&quot;, named after the stream that rises at Melbourn Bury and flows north into the River Rhee. The Domesday Book has nine entries for Meldreth:

Due to its proximity to Cambridge, much of the land has at some time been owned by colleges of the University of Cambridge. In the early 16th century, Christ&#x27;s College moved to its Meldreth estate to escape the plague.

In 1952, the Royal Train carrying King George VI&#x27;s body passed through the station on its journey from Sandringham to London. Residents gathered on the platform to pay their last respects to the King.

The village still has a stocks and whipping post, the traditional medieval punishment, last used in the village in 1860.

==Church==
The parish church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity since 1443, consists of a chancel, aisled nave with south porch, and a west tower housing eight bells. More peals have been rung at Holy Trinity than any other church. The chancel is unusually long and dates from the 12th century, perhaps indicating the existence of an earlier minster on the site. The tower dates from the late 12th century, with the top stage added in the late 13th century.

==Village life==
The village, once famous for its fruit production, is now home to many commuters who work in Cambridge and London. Orchards still exist in Meldreth, and locally grown fruits and vegetables are sold in the village, most notably the Meldreth greengage.

The village retains its own railway station which opened in 1851. In 2001, local celebrations marked the 150th anniversary of Meldreth railway station, which serves the residents of Meldreth and the neighbouring village of Melbourn. Trains from the station run into Cambridge and London King&#x27;s Cross.

Only one public house is still open; The British Queen has been open since the first half of the 19th century. The first recorded pub in the village was The Bell (also known as The Old Bell or The Blue Bell Inn) which was housed in a thatched building that was built in 1676 and first recorded as a public house in 1726. The Bell closed in 1910. The Railway Tavern opened in 1858 and closed in 1959. It latterly housed the recently closed Tavern Art Gallery. The Dumb Flea pub in Chiswick End closed in 1956 and is now a private house. Other former pubs include The Chequer, recorded in 1785 but believed to have closed soon after, and The Green Man which stood next to the brewery at North End and was open from 1808 till the late 19th century.

Meldreth is home to Meldreth Manor School, run by The Aurora Group, as well as home to Meldreth Primary School.

The village has a Local Nature Reserve, Melwood.

==Prime Meridian==
The prime meridian runs through the village. A stone marker was erected near the western end of Fenny Lane, and unveiled in December 1999 by the Astronomer Royal, Sir Martin Rees.

<doc id="557744" wikidata="Q2519420" url="?curid=557744" title="Battle-class destroyer">
<text>The Battle class were a class of destroyers of the British Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Australian Navy (RAN), named after naval or other battles fought by British or English forces. Built in three groups, the first group were ordered under the 1942 naval estimates. A modified second and third group, together with two ships of an extended design were planned for the 1943 and 1944 estimates. Most of these ships were cancelled when it became apparent that the war was being won and the ships would not be required, although two ships of the third group, ordered for the RAN, were not cancelled and were subsequently completed in Australia.

Seven Battles were commissioned before the end of World War II, but only saw action, with the British Pacific Fleet.

==&quot;1942&quot; or &quot;Early Battle&quot; class==
The first years of World War II had shown that British destroyers were ill-equipped to deal with concentrated air attacks, and the Royal Navy suffered heavy losses as a result. In 1941 urgent consideration of the problem led to a naval staff requirement for a new class of large fleet destroyer with High Angle (HA) twin guns and an HA control system. It was decided that this main armament would be set forward in a superfiring configuration for all guns to engage one target. Arcs of fire were increased by setting the bridge structure further aft than normal. The proposed anti-aircraft (AA) armament were eight 40/60 mm guns in twin mountings set atop the middle and after deck houses to give all around, overlapping arcs of fire. These were to be supplemented by 20 mm guns positioned variously around the ship. Eight torpedo tubes were to be carried in two quadruple mounts. A/S armament called for two depth charge rails and four depth charge throwers to be fitted. A new feature was the first use of stabilisers in a destroyer, providing a steadier platform for AA gunnery.

With these parameters accepted, a sketch design was approved in the autumn of 1941 and orders for sixteen ships (two flotillas) were placed under the 1942 programme. Considerably larger than the standard fleet destroyer, these ships were seen as a replacement for the which had already suffered many losses. With a length of they were two feet longer than the Tribals and with a beam of were just over three feet wider. It was decided to abandon the usual alphabetical naming of destroyer flotillas and name these ships after famous land and sea battles, thus these ships became known as the 1942 Battle class.

===Orders and construction===
The first ten ships were ordered on 27 April 1942. These comprised &quot;Barfleur&quot;, &quot;Trafalgar&quot; and &quot;St Kitts&quot; (with Swan Hunter, Wallsend); &quot;Armada&quot;, &quot;Solebay&quot; and &quot;Saintes&quot; (with Hawthorn Leslie); &quot;Camperdown&quot; and &quot;Finisterre&quot; (with Fairfield, Govan); and &quot;Hogue&quot; and (with White, Cowes).

The remaining six ships were ordered on 12 August 1942. These comprised &quot;Gabbard&quot; (with Swan Hunter); &quot;Gravelines&quot; and &quot;Sluys&quot; (with Cammell Laird); and &quot;Cadiz&quot;, &quot;St James&quot; and &quot;Vigo&quot; (with Fairfield, Govan). The order for &quot;Hogue&quot; and &quot;Lagos&quot; was moved from Whites to Cammell Laird on the same date.

===Modifications===
The placing of orders did not stop design work but by this time plans were too far advanced for big changes to be considered, although some design changes were made to the armament. One change, incorporated with protection against air-attack in mind, was the decision to standardise on the 4.5-inch gun for the main armament rather than the low angle 4.7 inch that was the usual destroyer gun and only effective against surface targets. The four 4.5 inch guns, fitted in two Mk IV turrets, were capable of high angle fire against aircraft and were controlled from a Director Control Tower (DCT) fitted with radar. Another alteration made whilst building was the fitting of a 4-inch gun on a gundeck abaft the funnel. It was also decided that the twin 40/60 mm guns would be fitted on Hazemeyer Mark IV mountings fitted with Radar Type 282. These would be mounted side by side on the middle gundeck between the torpedo tubes and en-echelon atop the after deckhouse. Due to delays in completion, the plans for 20 mm guns were altered and eventually four single 40/60 mm guns in Mk VII mountings were fitted, one forward of the bridge structure behind &#x27;B&#x27; gun, one on either bridge wing and one aft on the quarterdeck.

Experience in the Pacific, against the Japanese, pointed to the limited usefulness of the 4 inch gun abaft the funnel and only the first ships completed, &quot;Barfleur&quot;, &quot;Armada&quot;, &quot;Trafalgar&quot;, &quot;Camperdown&quot;, &quot;Hogue&quot; and &quot;Lagos&quot; were fitted with the gun. In all other ships the gun was replaced by two single 40/60 mm Mk VII giving a total of 14 Bofors, the heaviest light AA armament of any British destroyer and heavier than that carried in many cruisers. In time, all the ships fitted with the 4 inch gun had them removed and replaced with the two single 40/60 mm Mk VII Bofors

All ships were completed with a lattice foremast, instead of the pole mast shown in the original plans. This enabled the ships to carry the latest radar and various IFF transponders and receivers on the foremast. Typical radar fit when built was the &quot;cheese&quot; of Type 293 target indication at the masthead, Radar Type 291 air warning on the mainmast and the twin nacelles Radar Type 275 fire control on the Mk. VI director.

===Service===
Delays in completion of these ships was caused, as in other classes, by the late delivery of the Mk VI DCTs and fire control systems. &quot;Barfleur&quot; was launched first in November 1943 and was completed by Swan Hunter in mid-1944 but by August her DCT had still not been delivered. &quot;Barfleur&quot; ran trials in September and was commissioned but had to return to the Tyne to await delivery and fitting of her director and fire control system. Other ships were similarly affected, &quot;Trafalgar&quot; spending many months laid up in the Tyne in 1944.

It was intended that the first eight ships would form the 19th Destroyer Flotilla with the British Pacific Fleet in the Far East, but only &quot;Barfleur&quot; reached the Pacific in time to take part in operations against Japan. &quot;Barfleur&quot; was in Tokyo Bay during the Japanese surrender ceremony on 3 September 1945 and after the end of the war she was joined by &quot;Armada&quot;, &quot;Trafalgar&quot;, &quot;Hogue&quot;, &quot;Lagos&quot; and &quot;Camperdown&quot;. In 1947 all six ships returned home and went into reserve.

The other two other ships destined for the 19th Flotilla, &quot;Solebay&quot; and &quot;Finisterre&quot;, were retained in home waters; &quot;Finisterre&quot; became gunnery training ship for the Portsmouth Command, and &quot;Solebay&quot; leader of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, Home Fleet, which consisted of six ships of the second flotilla: &quot;Cadiz&quot;, &quot;Gabbard&quot;, &quot;St. James&quot;, &quot;St. Kitts&quot;, (see below) and . The other two ships of the second flotilla, &quot;Gravelines&quot; and &quot;Vigo&quot;, went straight into reserve upon completion.

The ships of the second flotilla saw a change in the light AA armament. The tri-axially stabilised Dutch &quot;Hazemeyer&quot; mountings with their Radar Type 282 were regarded as unreliable and were replaced by an Admiralty-designed Stabilised Tachymetric Anti Aircraft Gun (STAAG) mount. The Hazemeyer&#x27;s Radar Type 282 was metric and operated through a pair of Yagi antennae and could therefore only supply target range. The British design used Radar Type 262 centimetric radar with a small spinning dish aerial, which gave range and bearing and was capable of &quot;locking on&quot; to a target and could train and elevate the guns as the target moved. The British design was more complicated than the Dutch design and weighed a massive each (compared with the Hazemeyer&#x27;s ). This meant that only two mountings could be installed, to keep the top hamper within acceptable limits. These were fitted to the top of the after deckhouse. The middle gundeck, between the torpedo tubes, was left empty. The mountings proved even less reliable than the ones they replaced and led to three ships &quot;Saintes&quot;, &quot;Camperdown&quot; and &quot;Trafalgar&quot; eventually having them replaced by Mk V &quot;utility&quot; mountings, each controlled by a Simple Tachymetric Director (STD) mounted on the top of the gun crew shelter. A further refinement saw the removal of the depth charge equipment and single 40/60 mm Bofors gun from the quarterdeck, to be replaced by a Squid ahead-throwing depth-charge mortar. The after deckhouse was extended to contain a mortar handling room. This eventually became standard for all of the 1942 Battles.

A variation occurred when &quot;Saintes&quot; was completed with a 4.5 inch RP 41 Mark VI turret in the &quot;B&quot; gun position. Commissioned in September 1946 into the 5th Destroyer Flotilla &quot;Saintes&quot; spent most of the time in independent trials of the new gun. Upon completion of trials &quot;Saintes&quot; paid off and was refitted with the standard Battle class armament, then laid up.

&quot;Saintes&quot; recommissioned in 1949 when, as D3 and with &quot;Armada&quot;, &quot;Vigo&quot; and &quot;Gravelines&quot;, they replaced and the V class as the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, Mediterranean Fleet. &quot;Barfleur&quot; replaced &quot;Gravelines&quot; in the 3rd Flotilla but no major changes took place until 1953. The appearance of the &quot;Daring&quot;s at this time spelled the demise of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, and after the Coronation Review all six ships went into reserve. Only two, &quot;Solebay&quot; and &quot;St. Kitts&quot;. saw further service with the Royal Navy. In 1956 &quot;Saintes&quot; headed home for a major refit at Rosyth, her crew transferring to &quot;Armada&quot;. &quot;Vigo&quot; also returning to home waters to replace &quot;Finisterre&quot; as gunnery training ship at Portsmouth. By late 1956 only four ships remained operational. &quot;Armada&quot;, &quot;Barfleur&quot; and &quot;St. Kitts&quot; with the 3rd Destroyer Squadron (as they were now called) and &quot;Vigo&quot; as Portsmouth Command gunnery training ship. All the other ships were either in reserve or refitting. Most had the fire control system updated and new ASDIC fitted, and those that still had the quarterdeck AA gun had it replaced by the Squid A/S mortar.

In 1957, the Ch-class destroyers of the 1st Destroyer Squadron were replaced by the newly refitted &quot;Solebay&quot;, &quot;Hogue&quot; and &quot;Lagos&quot;. Prior to 1960, &quot;Hogue&quot; filmed for destroyer night attack scenes used in the film &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot;. Initially serving with the Mediterranean Fleet, in 1959 the squadron deployed to the Far East, where &quot;Hogue&quot;″s career came to an abrupt end. While participating in a night-time exercise with other navies off Ceylon on 25 August, &quot;Hogue&quot; collided with the Indian light cruiser , which rammed &quot;Hogue&quot;, crushing the destroyer&#x27;s bow, killing a sailor and wounding three others. She was towed to Singapore where she was laid up until scrapped in 1962. Upon the return home of the remaining ships in 1960 &quot;Hogue&quot; was replaced in the squadron by &quot;Finisterre&quot;.

In 1957 a newly refitted &quot;Camperdown&quot;, which had been in reserve since returning from the Far East with the 19th Destroyer Flotilla ten years previously, was brought back into service to relieve &quot;St. Kitts&quot; in the 3rd Destroyer Squadron. The following year &quot;Saintes&quot; having finished her major refit at Rosyth resumed command of the 3rd Squadron, relieving &quot;Barfleur&quot; in the Mediterranean. Five years later &quot;St. Kitts&quot; was broken up at Sunderland; &quot;Barfleur&quot; was laid up for several years before being broken up at Dalmuir in 1966.

One other Battle was given a new lease of life. &quot;Trafalgar&quot; also laid up in 1947 was refitted and commissioned in 1958 as leader of the 7th Destroyer Squadron. She continued in service, alternating between the Home and Mediterranean Fleets until she finally paid off in 1963. In 1970 she arrived at Dalmuir to be broken up.

&quot;Gravelines &quot; and &quot;St. James&quot; also commenced refit at Devonport in 1958 but these were stopped a few months later. Both ships were sent to the breakers in 1961.

In 1957 &quot;Cadiz&quot; and &quot;Gabbard&quot; were sold to Pakistan and renamed &quot;Khaibar&quot; and &quot;Badr&quot;. &quot;Khaibar&quot; was lost to a missile attack in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.

&quot;Sluys&quot; ended 13 years in the Devonport reserve when she was sold to Iran in 1966. Renamed she completed a three-year refit at Vosper Thornycroft at Southampton. Her profile was radically altered. She was given a new, plated foremast to carry the parabolic aerial of a Plessey AWS 1 long range search radar. A fully enclosed bridge replaced the usual &quot;open sundeck&quot; above the forward superstructure. She retained her 4.5 inch main armament, but these were now controlled by a modern radar and fire control system. Her AA armament now consisted of four single 40/60 mm guns and a quadruple Sea Cat missile launcher on the after end of a new deckhouse which stretched from just aft of the funnel to the quarterdeck. She commissioned in 1970 as a training ship. During 1975/6 she was refitted at Cape Town and fitted with surface-to-surface missile launchers. During a later refit carried out by the Russians, her main gunnery radar and control systems were again modernised, although she retained her original guns and the Sea Cat system was replaced by a modern Russian surface-to-air missile system. She was still in existence in the early 1990s although believed to be non-operational.

In 1960 the 1st and 3rd Destroyer Squadrons were amalgamated to form a new 1st Destroyer Squadron. As a result, &quot;Lagos&quot; and &quot;Armada&quot; paid off into reserve, &quot;Armada&quot; being broken up at Inverkeithing in 1965 and &quot;Lagos&quot; at Bo&#x27;ness in 1967.

The new 1st Destroyer Squadron completed a very busy final two-year commission before finally paying off in May 1962. &quot;Solebay&quot; became Portsmouth harbour training ship until being scrapped at Troon in 1967. &quot;Finisterre&quot; remained in Chatham reserve until being broken up at Dalmuir in 1967. &quot;Camperdown&quot; was laid up in the Hamoaze at Devonport for many years until finally being sent to the breakers yard at Faslane in 1970.

Now only &quot;Saintes&quot; remained. On paying off in 1962, a volunteer towing crew from her last commission took her to Rosyth, where she went into reserve. Here she was used as the training ship for Artificer Apprentices from who kept her engines and machinery in full working order. She was eventually replaced by the frigate in 1972 and she too headed for the breakers yard at Cairn Ryan, the last of the Royal Navy&#x27;s 1942 Battle class destroyers.

==&quot;1943&quot; or &quot;Later Battle&quot; class==
Even after the orders for the earlier, 1942 Battle class had been placed much discussion was still taking place within the naval staff about the final design. There was much debate about the type and disposition of the main armament. In some quarters it was felt that the two main turrets should be distributed one forward and one aft. Many reasons were given for this, but the most logical seems to have been preventing a single hit from disabling both guns. An argument was put forward in some quarters that these ships were underarmed for their size, and there was a call for a third turret to be mounted aft.

Admiral Andrew Cunningham, whilst taking passage in the 1942 Battle-class ship , was rather unflattering in his description of these ships saying that they were &quot;too large&quot; and &quot;had every damned weapon and gadget except guns&quot;. Modern naval architects feel this is unfair as the role of destroyers had changed since the admiral commanded a destroyer at the battle of Jutland. The original role of the destroyers was torpedo attack on enemy ships, but their role in the late 1940s was to protect the fleet (and themselves) from aircraft and submarines. The Battle class were probably better at this task than any other Second World War British destroyer.

A further criticism, not just of the Battle-class design, but of British destroyers generally, was of the main machinery layout. Until 1936 all destroyers were laid out with three boiler rooms, as the naval staff considered this the minimum requirement for battle damage survivability. In 1936 the head of the destroyer section of the Constructors Department came up with a radical new design for the J class. This included a new system of longitudinal framing to both ease construction and increase the integral strength of the ships. It also called for a two-boiler layout with both boilers fitted back to back, allowing them to vent up a single large funnel. This decreased the ships silhouette and gave improved firing arcs for the anti-aircraft armament. This layout and hull design proved very effective and made for good-looking ships. The J-class design was used in all following destroyer designs until the advent of the and classes. However, the boiler-room layout was a continuing source of criticism, as a single well-placed hit could cripple a ship completely.

In order to find a solution to these criticisms, it was originally planned that 32 ships (four flotillas) of an improved design would be built under the 1943 and 1944 Naval Estimates and that there would be changes in both armament and layout in the later ships. It was expected that the 4.5-in RP41 BD Mk VI turret, tested by &quot;Saintes&quot; from 1946/48, would be available to arm the later ships. Ultimately 26 ships were ordered. These formed two distinct groups, plus two ships of an expanded design.

The first 16 ships (two flotillas) were ordered in early 1943. They were based on a slightly widened version of the 1942 ships. They were to be fitted with the American Type 37 DCT which was now becoming available and which would be equipped with the British Radar Type 275 fire control set and Medium Range System (MRS) 9 fire control system. In an attempt to counter the criticisms that the ships were underarmed for their size, and were incapable of engaging a target right aft, a single 4.5 inch gun on a standard Mk V mounting would be positioned on the original 4 inch gun deck abaft the funnel. In the event, these guns failed to provide a solution as they were restricted to firing on either beam because the midship positioning meant their arc of fire was fouled by the ships fore and aft superstructure. The ships&#x27; AA armament was reduced to eight 40/60 mm Bofors, two twin STAAG Mk. II mountings on top of the after deckhouse, one twin Mk. V on the middle deckhouse controlled by an STD mounted on top of the gun crew shelter, and a single mounting Mk. VII on either bridge wing. All ships would be fitted with a Squid Anti-submarine mortar on the quarterdeck and ten 21-inch torpedo tubes in two quintuple mountings.

The last flotilla of eight ships and two ships of an expanded design were ordered under the 1944 estimates. The first eight ships were to be fitted with two twin 4.5-inch guns forward in the new RP41 Mk VI turrets. These turrets offered improved ammunition handling and a faster rate of fire due to their semi-automatic breech action and it was thought that this was sufficient to preclude the fitting of the single gun amidships. The bridge structure was raised as earlier trials in &quot;Saintes&quot; had noted that the higher profile of the Mk VI turret obstructed visibility forward. The AA armament was increased in these ships as the weight saved by dispensing with the single 4.5-inch gun amidships meant that a third twin STAAG could be fitted together with five single 40/60 mm guns giving a total of eleven light AA guns.

The two extended ships were intended to bury all criticisms of the design once and for all. The hull dimensions were increased, adding in length and to the beam. This allowed for a third twin 4.5-in Mk VI turret to be mounted aft. The main reason for the increase in length, however, was the planned change in the mechanical layout of these ships. Since the inception of the J class, the boilers had been concentrated together, an arrangement which allowed a reduced hull length. However, plans drawn up for the smaller Weapon class showed that this reduction was, in fact, minimal, so a decision was made to employ a unit arrangement for the propulsion machinery in these ships, based on the same lines as proposed for the Weapon class.

===Orders and construction===
Twenty-four ships (plus two of an enlarged/extended design) were included in the 1943 Programme. Six were ordered on 10 March 1943, with names commemorating land, as well as sea, battles: &quot;Agincourt&quot; and &quot;Alamein&quot; (from Hawthorn Leslie); &quot;Aisne&quot; and &quot;Albuera&quot; (from Vickers, Tyne); and &quot;Barrosa&quot; and &quot;Matapan&quot; (from John Brown, Clydebank).

Fifteen ships were ordered on 24 March 1943:&quot;Corunna&quot;, &quot;Oudenarde&quot; and &quot;River Plate&quot; (from Swan Hunter); &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, (original) &quot;Malplaquet&quot; and &quot;St Lucia&quot; (from Stephen); &quot;Belle Isle&quot; and &quot;Omdurman&quot; (from Fairfield); &quot;Jutland&quot;, &quot;Mons&quot; and &quot;Poictiers&quot; (from Hawthorn Leslie; &quot;Poictiers&quot; is the spelling used for &quot;Poitiers&quot; at the time of the battle); and &quot;Namur&quot;, &quot;Navarino&quot;, &quot;San Domingo&quot; and &quot;Somme&quot; (from Cammell Laird).

Five ships were ordered on 5 June 1943: &quot;Talavera&quot; and &quot;Trincomalee&quot; (from John Brown); &quot;Waterloo&quot; and &quot;Ypres&quot; (from Fairfield); and &quot;Vimiera&quot; (from Cammell Laird). The last two were the extended design and would eventually be built as the &quot;Daring&quot; Class.

===Service===
Although all of the ships were laid down between late 1943 and mid 1945 they, like previous members of the class, were plagued by delays in the provision of equipment. As a result, few had been launched by the end of hostilities and it became obvious that not all of them would be required. As a result, in September 1945, the Admiralty ordered work stopped on sixteen of the ships. As a result, seven ships, &quot;Mons&quot;, &quot;Omdurman&quot;, &quot;Somme&quot;, &quot;River Plate&quot;, &quot;St. Lucia&quot;, &quot;San Domingo&quot; and &quot;Waterloo&quot;, were broken up on the slipway. A further five, &quot;Belle Isle&quot;, &quot;Navarino&quot;, &quot;Poictiers&quot;, &quot;Talavera&quot; and &quot;Trincomalee&quot; were scrapped immediately upon launching. The uncompleted hulls of four ships, &quot;Albuera&quot;, &quot;Jutland&quot;, &quot;Namur&quot; and &quot;Oudenarde&quot; were laid up with the possibility that they could be completed at a later date. This policy was adopted with other classes of ship, notably cruisers and carriers, some of which were completed up to fourteen years after the end of the war. Although consideration was given to completing these vessels in 1950, it was never done and they were all scrapped between 1957 and 1961.

The two extended ships, &quot;Vimiera&quot; and &quot;Ypres&quot; were not scrapped at this time but eventually became a part of the &quot;Daring&quot; class, programme authorised in 1946. The original order was for sixteen ships, but construction was a long drawn out affair and eventually the Admiralty cancelled eight of the ships. At this time &quot;Vimiera&quot;, which had been renamed &quot;Danae&quot; was scrapped but &quot;Ypres&quot; was finally commissioned into the Royal Navy as .

This left a flotilla of eight ships, &quot;Agincourt&quot;, , &quot;Alamein&quot;, &quot;Barrosa&quot;, &quot;Corruna&quot;, &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, &quot;Jutland&quot; (ex-&quot;Malplaquet&quot;) and &quot;Matapan&quot; to be completed for service in the Royal Navy and, as with other ships built after the end of hostilities, work proceeded at a very slow pace. The first ship &quot;Agincourt&quot; was laid down in December 1943 but not completed until the end of June 1947. &quot;Alamein&quot;, laid down less than three months behind her sister ship, was not completed until May 1948.

It was originally intended that all eight ships would form the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, but by 1947 the post-war manning crisis had reached its peak and so &quot;Alamein&quot;, &quot;Barrosa&quot;, &quot;Corunna&quot; and &quot;Matapan&quot; went into reserve. This left only &quot;Agincourt&quot;, &quot;Aisne&quot;, &quot;Jutland&quot; (the original &quot;Malplaquet&quot; which had been renamed &quot;Jutland&quot; after launching) and &quot;Dunkirk&quot; in service.

1948, however, saw all but &quot;Matapan&quot; back in service with the Home Fleet, but just over a year later another reduction took place. In 1950 a decision was made to pay off several destroyers in the Home and Mediterranean Fleets and replace them with s. &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, &quot;Barrosa&quot; and &quot;Alamein&quot; paid off into reserve and &quot;Aisne&quot; and &quot;Jutland&quot; were temporarily laid up for nearly a year.

In 1951 the 4th Destroyer Squadron was back in business. Consisting of &quot;Agincourt&quot;, &quot;Aisne&quot;, &quot;Jutland&quot; and &quot;Corunna&quot; and converted to General Service Commissions the squadron deployed between the Home and Mediterranean Fleets for the next few years. In 1953 &quot;Barrosa&quot; replaced &quot;Jutland&quot; and in 1957 &quot;Aisne&quot; was replaced by &quot;Alamein&quot;. In March 1959 there was a collision in the Bay of Biscay between &quot;Barrosa&quot; and &quot;Corunna&quot;. The following month the 4th Squadron was disbanded. &quot;Alamein&quot; went into reserve and was broken up at Blyth in 1964. &quot;Agincourt&quot;, &quot;Aisne&quot;, &quot;Barrosa&quot; and &quot;Corunna&quot; were placed in dockyard hands for conversion to radar pickets.

In 1958 &quot;Jutland&quot; and &quot;Dunkirk&quot; recommissioned as part of the 7th Destroyer Squadron. Led by the 1942 Battle &quot;Trafalgar&quot;, the squadron completed two General Service Home / Mediterranean Fleet deployments before &quot;Jutland&quot; paid off into reserve in 1961. She was broken up at Blyth in 1965. &quot;Dunkirk&quot; did a further two-year General Service deployment with the squadron before paying off in 1963. She was broken up at Faslane in 1965.

===Aircraft Direction Conversion===
As early as 1944 it had been suggested that the 1943 Battle class could be fitted with a long range early warning radar fitted to a mast amidships, albeit at the expense of some of the torpedo tubes and AA armament. The idea was not taken up at the time but in the early post-war years a need was identified for a Fast Air Detection Escort (FADE). These ships would accompany the fleet and detect, identify and track potential targets and direct friendly aircraft to engage them, a role known as Aircraft Direction (A/D).

A new frigate, the Type 61, was designed to carry out this role, however, it became clear that with a top speed of only these ships would not be able to keep up with a carrier group. Consideration was therefore given to converting existing ships to carry out this role with carrier groups. The latest long range radar available at that time was the Type 965. The Radar Type 965 came with two aerial configurations, the AKE-1, known as &quot;the bedstead&quot;, and the AKE-2, known as &quot;the double bedstead&quot;. The AKE-1 weighed in at almost two tons and the AKE-2 at a massive four tons. It soon became clear that only a large ship, like a &quot;Battle&quot; class destroyer would be able to carry such a load.

In 1955 a decision was made to convert four Battle class ships to Fast Air Detection Escorts, although the work was not started until 1959. The four ships chosen for conversion were &quot;Agincourt&quot;, &quot;Aisne&quot;, &quot;Barrosa&quot; and &quot;Corunna&quot;. On completion of the conversions only the hull, engines, funnel, forward superstructure and main armament remained of the original ships. A huge new lattice foremast was fitted immediately abaft the bridge. The base of this mast straddled the entire width of the ship and was surmounted by a large 4 ton Type 965 AKE-2 double bedstead aerial, with a Type 293Q mounted on a platform below. All torpedo tubes and light AA armament were removed and a large deckhouse containing generators and radar offices was built abaft the funnel. A new lattice mainmast carried a Radar Type 277Q height finder and an array of ESM and DF aerials. The after deckhouse was extended and a GWS 21 Sea Cat SAM system was mounted on top. The ships retained the Squid A/S mortar on the quarterdeck.

The conversions of &quot; Corunna&quot; at Rosyth Dockyard and &quot;Aisne&quot; at Chatham Dockyard were completed in 1962 and both ships joined the 7th Destroyer Squadron in the Mediterranean. On completion of her refit at Portsmouth, &quot;Agincourt&quot; joined the 5th DS in home waters. &quot;Corunna&quot;, however, ended up further afield. On completion of her refit at Devonport she joined the 8th Destroyer Squadron in the Far East. These arrangements were short lived as, in 1963, the Admiralty reorganised the frigate and destroyer squadrons into escort squadrons. Each escort squadron comprised a mix of ships of varying type in order to provide an increased capability within each group.

&quot;Corunna&quot; transferred to the 21st Escort Group which included a deployment to the Far East from September 1964 to August 1965. On returning home she began a refit at Rosyth in September 1965 and on completion in 1967 went into operational reserve at Portsmouth where she remained until put on the disposal list in 1972. In 1974 she was towed from Portsmouth to Sunderland for breaking but was then towed to Blyth and broken up in 1975.

&quot;Aisne&quot; transferred to the 23rd Escort Group and after a short spell joined 30th Escort Group in January 1964 and served in the Mediterranean from April to September 1964 and in the Far East from September to December 1964 and from July to December 1965. She recommissioned in January 1966 and served in the Far East from August 1966 to April 1967. In December 1967 she was sent to the West Indies, returning in March 1968. She paid off in August of that year and was broken up at Inverkeithing in 1970.

&quot;Agincourt&quot; spent four and a half years rotating between Home and Mediterranean waters, first as part of the 5th DS and then, after the reorganisation into Escort Squadrons, with 23ES and 27ES. Reduced to reserve at Portsmouth in October 1966 she was put on the disposal list in 1972. She was broken up at Sunderland in 1974.

&quot;Barrosa&quot; transferred to the 24ES and, apart from two spells at home between July 1966 and August 1967 and July to September 1968, spent all of her life as a radar picket serving in the Far East. She paid off into reserve at Devonport in December 1968. In 1971 she joined her sister ships at Portsmouth and was put on the disposal list in 1972. She was used as a stores hulk at Portsmouth until being towed to Blyth to be broken up in 1978.

The short life of these ships after their conversion was due to changes in defence policy made by the Labour Government which came to power in 1964. The decision to run down the carrier fleet, together with the withdrawal of British forces from the Far East, reduced the need for fast air direction ships. Moreover, the general purpose frigates then being built, such as the Leander class, were fitted with Type 965 radar and modern operations rooms, so they could replace the converted &#x27;Battles&#x27; in most circumstances.

===HMS &quot;Matapan&quot;===
Laid up on completion of her trials in 1947, having carried out only 150 hours steaming, the need to replace &quot;Verulam&quot; as Sonar Trials Ship for the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment at Portland saw the conversion and eventual commissioning of &quot;Matapan&quot;. In 1971 &quot;Matapan&quot; was towed to Portsmouth to begin her conversion to sonar trials ship. She was stripped of all armament and the forecastle deck was extended right to the stern to provide increased space to accommodate scientists and trials equipment, plus a large Sick Bay. She was fitted with a second funnel for the exhausting of fumes from the extra generators required to power the sonar equipment. A plated foremast carried radar and communications aerials, and a new fully enclosed bridge was fitted. A new after deckhouse, which ran from the after funnel to the quarterdeck was fitted with a helicopter landing deck on the top. Her refit took two years but she finally commissioned in 1973. After 24 years in the Devonport reserve &quot;Matapan&quot; had finally found a role in the navy of the seventies. Her trials period lasted for five years, with a major deployment to the United States in 1976, working with US Navy submarines, much of the work of this vessel remains classified. She paid off at Portsmouth in 1977 and was broken up at Blyth in 1978.

==&quot;1944&quot; or &quot;Australian Battle&quot; class==

The original building programme for the 1943 ships included provision for the later ships, the third flotilla, to be armed with the new 4.5-inch Mark VI turret. Although these ships were cancelled by the Admiralty, two ships of this type had been ordered by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in Australia in 1945. Neither of these ships were cancelled and both ships were laid down in 1946, although, like the building programme in Britain, progress was slow. The first of the two ships, , was not completed by HMA Dockyard at Williamstown until 1950, and sister ship , built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, was not completed until the following year. The only difference between these ships and those planned for the Royal Navy was a distinctive funnel cowl fitted to both ships.

&quot;Tobruk&quot; remained in service until 1960 when she was placed in reserve after being damaged in a friendly-fire accident. &quot;Anzac&quot; had her STAAG mountings removed at about this time and continued in service as a training ship. She was further modified for this role in 1966 when &#x27;B&#x27; turret was removed and replaced by a deckhouse. Another deckhouse was built aft. She was laid up in 1974. Both ships were broken up in 1975.

<doc id="557746" wikidata="Q2094308" url="?curid=557746" title="Music and politics">
<text>The connection between music and politics has been seen in many cultures. People in the past and present – especially politicians, politically-engaged musicians and listeners – hold that music can &#x27;express&#x27; political ideas and ideologies, such as rejection of the establishment (&#x27;anti-establishment&#x27;) or protest against state or private actions, including war through anti-war songs, but also energize national sentiments and nationalist ideologies through national anthems and patriotic songs. Because people attribute these meanings and effects to the music they consider political, music plays an important role in political campaigns, protest marches as well as state ceremonies. Much (but not all) of the music that is considered political or related to politics are songs, and many of these are topical songs, i.e. songs with topical lyrics, made for a particular time and place.

==Introduction==
Although the use of music to mobilise political activists (and their audiences) as well as to enhance the impact of political rituals on political actors and people observing the rituals from the outside suggests that music in political contexts has an impact on participants and audiences, it is not clear how or to what extent general audiences relate to music in political contexts. Songs can be used to &quot;transport&quot; (or more precisely: accompany) lyrics with a political message. Like any political message, the political message of a song text set to music cannot be understood independently of its contemporary political context. It may have been clear to contemporaries, but historians studying past texts (with or without music) need to reconstruct the political &#x27;content&#x27; of the lyrics and the political contexts in order to fully understand the texts (here: lyrics). In this everyday musical discourse, participants use the term &quot;political music&quot; to refer to songs (i.e. a combination of music with lyrics the latter set to the music and performed vocally). The political lyrics of such songs can in turn refer to an unlimited spectrum of political subjects, i.e. articulate both state-affirming and partisan opinions, or call for concrete political action. Additionally, a distinction can be made between the use of lyrics that raise awareness and support the formation of a certain political &#x27;consciousness&#x27; and lyrics &#x27;as advocacy&#x27;.

Participants in the informed discourse about music are aware that music itself is not political. If music listeners (including performers, composers, politicians and authorities who know music because they listen to it) &quot;see&quot; a relationship between certain music and politics, this is because, as a result of consequential logic, they attribute to this music the capacity to initiate certain (political) beliefs or behaviours in listeners. This relationship is also due to the specific functioning of music as a sign system, which is primarily based on similarities, structural analogies and associations that listeners construct between the music they listen to and non-musical things and phenomena.

Furthermore, some forms of music may be deemed political by cultural association, irrespective of political content, as evidenced by the way Western pop/rock bands such as The Beatles were censored by the State in the Eastern Bloc in the 1960s and 1970s, while being embraced by younger people as symbolic of social change. This points to the possibilities for discrepancy between the political intentions of musicians (if any), and reception of their music by wider society. Conversely, there is the possibility of the meaning of deliberate political content being missed by its intended audience, reasons for which could include obscurity or delivery of message, or audience indifference or antipathy.

It is difficult to predict how audiences will respond to political music, in terms of aural or even visual cues. For example, Bleich and Zillmann found that &quot;counter to expectations, highly rebellious students did not enjoy defiant rock videos more than did their less rebellious peers, nor did they consume more defiant rock music than did their peers&quot;, suggesting there may be little connection between behaviour and musical taste. Pedelty and Keefe argue that &quot;It is not clear to what extent the political messages in and around music motivate fans, become a catalyst for discussion, [or] function aesthetically&quot;.

However, in contrast they cite research that concludes, based on interpretive readings of lyrics and performances with a strong emphasis on historical contexts and links to social groups, that &quot;given the right historical circumstances, cultural conditions, and aesthetic qualities, popular music can help bring people together to form effective political communities&quot;.

Recent research has also suggested that in many schools around the world, including in modern democratic nations, music education has sometimes been used for the ideological purpose of instilling patriotism in children, and that particularly during wartime patriotic singing can escalate to inspire destructive jingoism.

Plato wrote: &quot;musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state, and ought to be prohibited. When modes of music change, the fundamental laws of the state always change with them;&quot; although this was written as a warning it can be taken as a revolutionary statement that music is much more than just melodies and harmonies but an important movement in the life of all human beings.

==Folk music==
===American folk revival===
The song &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; is perhaps the best-known example of political folk music, in this case a rallying-cry for the US Civil Rights Movement. Pete Seeger was involved in the popularisation of the song, as was Joan Baez. During the early part of the 20th century, poor working conditions and class struggle lead to the growth of the Labour movement and numerous songs advocating social and political reform. The most famous songwriter of the early 20th century &quot;Wobblies&quot; was Joe Hill. Later, from the 1940s through the 1960s, groups like the Almanac Singers and The Weavers were influential in reviving this type of socio-political music. Woody Guthrie&#x27;s &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; is one of the most famous American folk songs and its lyrics exemplify Guthrie&#x27;s socialistic patriotism. Pete Seeger&#x27;s &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot;, was a popular anti-war protest song. Many of these types of songs became popular during the Vietnam War era. &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;, by Bob Dylan, was a hit for Peter, Paul and Mary, and suggested that a younger generation was becoming more aware of global problems than many of the older generation. In 1964, Joan Baez had a top-ten hit in the UK with &quot;There but for Fortune&quot; (by Phil Ochs); it was a plea for the innocent victim of prejudice or inhumane policies. Many topical songwriters with social and political messages emerged from the folk music revival of the 1960s, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Judy Collins, Arlo Guthrie, and others.

The folk revival can be considered as a political re-invention of traditional song, a development encouraged by Left-leaning folk record labels and magazines such as Sing Out! and Broadside. The revival began in the 1930s and continued after World War II. Folk songs of this time gained popularity by using old hymns and songs but adapting the lyrics to fit the current social and political conditions. Archivists and artists such as Alan Lomax, Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie were crucial in popularising folk music, and the latter began to be known as the Lomax singers. This was an era of folk music in which some artists and their songs expressed clear political messages with the intention of swaying public opinion and recruiting support. In the UK, Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd performed similar roles, with Lloyd as folklorist and MacColl (often with Peggy Seeger) releasing dozens of albums which blended traditional songs with newer political material influenced by their Communist activism.

In the later, post-war revival, folk music found a new audience with college students, partly since universities provided the organisation necessary for sustaining music trends and an expanded, impressionable audience looking to rebel against the older generation. Nevertheless, the rhetoric of the United States government during the Cold War era was very powerful and in some ways overpowered the message of folk artists, such as in relation to public opinion regarding Communist-backed political causes. Various Gallup Polls that were conducted during this time suggest that Americans consistently saw Communism as a threat; for example, a 1954 poll shows that at the time 51% of Americans said that admitted Communists should be arrested, and in relation to music 64% of respondents said that if a radio singer is an admitted Communist he should be fired. Leading figures in the American folk revival such as Seeger, Earl Robinson and Irwin Silber were or had been members of the Communist Party, while others such as Guthrie (who had written a column for CPUSA magazine New Masses), Lee Hays and Paul Robeson were considered fellow travellers. As McCarthyism began to dominate the United States population and government, it was more difficult for folk artists to travel and perform since folk was pushed out of mainstream music. Artists were blacklisted, denounced by politicians and the media, and in the case of the 1949 Peekskill Riots, subject to mob attack.

In general, the significance of lyrics within folk music reduced as it became influenced by rock and roll. However, during the popular folk revival&#x27;s last phase in the early 1960s, new folk artists such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs began writing their own, original topical music, as opposed to mainly adapting traditional folksong.

===Contemporary Western folk music===
Although public attention shifted to rock music from the mid-1960s, folk singers such as Joan Baez and Tom Paxton continued to address political concerns in their music and activism. Baez&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Gracias a la Vida&quot; album was a response to events in Chile and included versions of songs by Nueva Canción Chilena singer-songwriters Violeta Parra and Víctor Jara. Paxton albums such as &quot;Outward Bound&quot; and &quot;Morning Again&quot; continued to highlight political issues. They were joined by other activist musicians such as Holly Near, Ray Korona, Charlie King, Anne Feeney, Jim Page, Utah Phillips and more recently David Rovics.

In the UK, the Ewan MacColl tradition of political folk has been continued since the 1960s by singer-songwriters such as Roy Bailey, Leon Rosselson and Dick Gaughan. Since the 1980s, a number of artists have blended folk protest with influences from punk and elsewhere to produce topical and political songs for a modern independent rock music audience, including Billy Bragg, Attila the Stockbroker, Robb Johnson, Alistair Hulett, The Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang, TV Smith, Chumbawamba and more recently Chris T-T and Grace Petrie.

=== Ireland ===

In Ireland, the Wolfe Tones is perhaps the best known band in the folk protest/rebel music tradition, recording political material since the late 1960s including songs by Dominic Behan on albums such as &quot;Let the People Sing&quot; and &quot;Rifles of the I.R.A.&quot; Christy Moore has also recorded much political material, including on debut solo album &quot;Paddy on the Road&quot;, produced by and featuring songs by Dominic Behan, and on albums such as &quot;Ride On&quot; (including &quot;Viva la Quinta Brigada&quot;), &quot;Ordinary Man&quot; and various artists LP &quot;H Block&quot; to which Moore contributed &quot;Ninety Miles from Dublin&quot;, in response to the Republican prisoners&#x27; blanket protest of the late 1970s. Earlier in the decade, The Barleycorn had held the #1 spot on the Irish charts for five weeks in 1972 with their first release &quot;The Men Behind the Wire&quot;, about internment, with all profits going to the families of internees; Republican label R&amp;O Records likewise released several records around this time to fundraise for the same cause, including the live album &quot;Smash Internment&quot;, recorded in Long Kesh, and The Wolfhounds&#x27; recording of Paddy McGuigan&#x27;s &quot;The Boys of the Old Brigade&quot;.

===Chicano folk===
Chicano folk music has long been a platform for political resistance and social commentary. From the 1960s and onward, Chicano musicians used their music to express their personal experiences of discrimination and oppression faced as Mexican-Americans in the United States. Political themes like the fight for immigrant rights, labor struggles, Chicano identity, and police brutality have been common subjects of their music. Through their music, Chicano musicians have also encouraged community empowerment, activism, and unity throughout the development of the Chicano Movement. Joan Baez is the most recognized figure of this movement.

===Folk music around the world===
Folk music had a strong connection with politics internationally. Hungary, for instance, experimented with a form of liberal Communism in the late Cold War era, which was reflected in much of their folk music. During the late twentieth century folk music was crucial in Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia as it allowed ethnicities to express their national identity in a time of political uncertainty and chaos.

In Communist China, exclusively national music was promoted. A flautist named Zhao Songtim – a member of the Zhejiang Song-and-Dance Troupe – attended an Arts festival in 1957 in Mexico but was punished for his international outlook by being expelled from the Troupe, and from 1966 to 1970 underwent &quot;re-education&quot;. In 1973 he returned to the Troupe but was expelled again following accusations.

An example of folk music being used for conservative, rather than radical, political ends is shown by the cultural activities of Edward Lansdale, a CIA chief who dedicated part of his career to counter-insurgency in the Philippines and Vietnam. Lansdale believed that the government&#x27;s best weapon against Communist rebellion was the support and trust of the population. In 1953 he arranged for the release of a campaign song widely credited with helping to elect Philippine president Ramon Magsaysay, an important US anti-communist ally. In 1965, intrigued by local Vietnamese customs and traditions, and the potential use of &#x27;applied folklore&#x27; as a technique of raising consciousness, he began to record and curate tapes of folk songs for intelligence purposes. He also urged performers such as Phạm Duy to write and perform patriotic songs to raise morale in South Vietnam. Duy had written topical songs popular during the anti-French struggle but then broke with the Communist-dominated Viet Minh.

==Blues and African-American music==
Blues songs have the reputation of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. Bessie Smith recorded protest song &quot;Poor Man Blues&quot; in 1928. Josh White recorded &quot;When Am I Going to be Called a Man&quot; in 1936 – at this time it was common for white men to address black men as &quot;boy&quot; – before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940&#x27;s &quot;Chain Gang&quot; and 1941&#x27;s &quot;Southern Exposure: An Album of Jim Crow Blues&quot;. Lead Belly&#x27;s &quot;Bourgeois Blues&quot; and Big Bill Broonzy&#x27;s &quot;Black, Brown and White&quot; (aka &quot;Get Back&quot;) protested racism. Billie Holiday recorded and popularized the song &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; in 1939. Written by Communist Lewis Allan, and also recorded by Josh White and Nina Simone, it addressed Southern racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including Madison Square Gardens. In the post-war era, J.B. Lenoir gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single &quot;Eisenhower Blues&quot; due to its title and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War. John Lee Hooker also sang &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Go to Vietnam&quot; on 1969 album &quot;Simply the Truth&quot;.

Paul Robeson, singer, actor, athlete, and civil rights activist, was investigated by the FBI and was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) for his outspoken political views. The State Department denied Robeson a passport and issued a &quot;stop notice&quot; at all ports, effectively confining him to the United States. In a symbolic act of defiance against the travel ban, labour unions in the U.S. and Canada organised a concert at the International Peace Arch on the border between Washington state and the Canadian province of British Columbia on May 18, 1952. Robeson stood on the back of a flat bed truck on the U.S. side of the border and performed a concert for a crowd on the Canadian side, variously estimated at between 20,000 and 40,000 people. He returned to perform a second concert at the Peace Arch in 1953, and over the next two years two further concerts were scheduled.

=== Jazz ===

The development of new genres of jazz through experimentation was inherently connected to the social movements of their respective times, especially during the Civil Rights and Black Power movements of the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s. The development of avant-garde, free, and Afrofuturist jazz was heavily connected to the desire to break free from societal norms and express the desire for a free voice. The music was also grounded in the Black Nationalists movements, and through their music, artists sought to reconnect African Americans with the traditional sounds of their ancestors.

In the development of avant-garde jazz, mainstream jazz magazines and critics (predominantly owned and operated by White people) harshly criticized the music and framed it as incoherent. Unlike earlier forms of jazz, improvisation was central to avant-garde and many artists did not notate their music so that it followed a free expression of their emotions. However, as the mainstream jazz apparatus looked down upon Black musicians it praised White artists like John Cage. Cage and other musicians were heavily influenced by avant-garde sound, but their music was highly regarded by the media and hailed as genius. Black musicians strived to break new grounds in music through the development of jazz to create methods of expression and autonomy. Meanwhile, structures of power within the jazz industry continuously placed pressures on this &quot;new thing&quot; so that it would assimilate in to normalized cultural standards, thus destroying its significance as a call for social and political change.

The experimentation of certain artists, like Sun Ra, directly called for the liberation of the African American and a return to African traditions. In his Afrofuturist science fiction film, Space is the Place, Sun Ra creates a colony for Black people on a distant planet in the cosmos far away from the antagonisms of white society. This messaging remained consistent through Afrofuturist music as it contradicted Euro-American musical rules.

Unfortunately, the politics of jazz replicated the patriarchy of general society. Along with the portrayals of jazz as black music, it followed the belief that jazz experimentalism was masculine. Throughout jazz music and academia, women are left behind and forgotten despite the crucial role they play. For example, Alice Coltrane had a largely successful career by paving the way of new sounds through Far Eastern influences and spiritualism. Yet, many of her accomplishments were overlooked because her husband, John Coltrane, had a more &quot;relevant&quot; career. Gender and womanhood are simple social constructs, similar to race, that have been replicated to create a hierarchy in jazz and academia. Recently there have been calls to recognize the importance of Black women in the development of jazz as authors like Sherrie Tucker encourage readers to listen to the stylistic differences to understanding the role gender plays in jazz.

=== Disco ===
Disco, contrary to popular belief, originated in Black queer communities and offered these communities a form of salvation or safe haven from social turmoil during the 1970s, in the Bronx and other parts of New York. It was agreed by many members prominent in the Disco scene that the music was about love and the vitality of &quot;absorbing the feeling&quot;, but the question regarding its political import received mixed responses. Although the songs themselves may not have explicitly made political claims, it&#x27;s important to note that disco, for many, was a &quot;form of escape&quot; and noted a &quot;dissolve of restrictions on black/gay people&quot;. The spirit of the 60s as well as the experience of Vietnam and black/gay liberation spurred the almost-frenzied energy pertinent in these discotheques. Not only did discos allow marginalized individuals an opportunity to express their sexuality and appreciate one another&#x27;s diversity, they had the ability to influence popular music. Although once mutually exclusive, discotheques allowed for the coming together of black music and pop; this shows how disco music not only led to a social appreciation for diversity, but offered a platform on which Black artists could succeed.
The eventual commercialization of disco set in motion its decline. This new commodified disco, very different than its diverse and queer roots, idealized the white individual and favored heteronormative relations. This not only allowed for the roots of such a diverse movement to be lost, but the erasure of the liberation and escapism it offered many minorities.

== Latin American music ==
Latin American music has been intertwined with politics across the years. 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s protest songs played a critical role in the fight against authoritarian regimes in countries like Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. Today, Latin American musicians continue to tackle pressing social and political issues like immigration, inequality, and corruption through their work. As economist and musician Sumangala Damodaran explains, lyrics intertwined with activism are shaping the vast region&#x27;s political landscape, creating a repertoire of new genres, and inspiring new generations of artists to do the same.

Some notable political issues across the region include discrimination, toxic masculinity, and colonization. Musical artists from across Latin America have contributed to the fight political issues occurring in their specific countries, like Bad Bunny for Puerto Rico and Los Tigres del Norte for Mexico. Throughout history, artists across Latin America have used music as a political tool to bring awareness to social issues.

=== Nueva Canción ===
Nueva canción or &quot;New Song&quot; is a musical movement that emerged in Latin America in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In a Remezcla article, Julyssa Lopez discloses that the genre focused on socially and politically conscious lyrics, often addressing the oppression and inequality experienced by marginalized communities, especially the Indigenous culture. Global languages and cultures professor Robert Neustadt affirms that artists like Violeta Parra, Víctor Jara, and Inti-Ilimani used their music to speak out against censorship, state violence, and human rights abuses.

Nueva canción was relevant because it gave voice and visibility to social and political issues and provided a platform for marginalized communities to express their struggles and resistance through music. It also played a significant role in the fight against oppressive regimes and contributed to the development of cultural identity and social consciousness in Latin America.

=== Salsa ===
Salsa is most known for its rhythm and inclusion of various instruments. Cumbia is characterized by its energetic rhythm and fusion of African, Indigenous, and European influences. It has evolved over time, incorporating various musical styles and instruments, and continues to dominate dance floors in Latin America and beyond. Cumbia&#x27;s relevance lies in its ability to bring people together, celebrate hybridity of the Latin American culture, while also serving as a marker of race and class differences in Latin American countries like Puerto, Rico, and Venezuela. Political themes in salsa have included racial discrimination, white supremacy, colonialism, sexism, homophobia, environmental disaster.

=== Reggaeton ===
As a musical genre born out of the Caribbean and Latin American regions, Reggaeton frequently engages with the tropes of other popular musical genres like love, money, and sexual conquests; but has also been used as a form of social commentary and has played a significant role in promoting social change. Reggaeton often addresses issues such as poverty, racism, police brutality, and political corruption in its lyrics. Additionally, many Reggaeton artists use their platforms to speak out against inequalities and social issues by organizing concerts, rallies, and charity events to raise awareness and funds for various social justice causes. Reggaeton also serves as a vehicle for empowering marginalized communities, particularly Black communities, Latin American people, women, and the LGBTQ+ community. Throughout its history, people have come to believe Reggaeton has become more than just a music genre but a voice for social justice and activism.

==== Bad Bunny ====
Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, is a Puerto Rican singer, rapper, and songwriter. He is known for his multiple chart-topping hits like “Titi Me Pregunto,” “DÁKITI”, “Yonaguni,” and “Callaita.” He was also the most listened-to artist in 2022. Additionally, Bad Bunny is recognized for his various awards, record-breaking achievement, and collaborations with major artist around the world.

One of his music video, &quot;Yo Perreo Sola&quot;, translating to I twerk alone, from his second album YHLQMDLG caused controversy as he dressed up in 3 drag outfits. His music video became the most-watched Latin music video in 2020.

In his most recent album, Un Verano Sin Ti, released May 2022, the 16th track was named “El Apagón,” translated to &quot;The Blackout.&quot; Rather than just releasing a music video, he worked with Puerto Rican reporter Bianca Graulau to produce a 18-minute documentary about the impact of US colonialism on the island and the displacement of Puerto Ricans. The documentary, “El Apagón&quot; functions as a political statement from Puerto Rico about the ongoing modern-day colonization of the island, which has been happening since 1917. The song was inspired by Act 22, which is a law passed in the United States after Hurricane Maria which offered tax incentives to people in the US relocating to Puerto Rico. The law allows U.S. citizens to avoid paying taxes on their property, income, and wealth in Puerto Rico if they become bona fide residents. To qualify as a bona fide resident, a person must be a U.S. citizen who actively earns income from another country, has no intention of moving back to the United States, and has a permanent address in the other country.

It caused many millionaires and investors to buy multiple properties on the island, which has led to the displacement of many Puerto Ricans from their homes. The law was intended to improve the economy, but it has failed to do so.

==== Ivy Queen ====
Ivy Queen, also known as &quot;La Reina del Reggaetón&quot; (The Queen of Reggaeton), has been a prominent figure in Latin music since the beginning of her musical career in 1995. Throughout her career, she has produced hits like “Quiero Bailar” and “Quiero Saber” while also using her platform to advocate for social justice, particularly by creating narrative-based lyrics and videos exploring topics mentioning femininity, domestic violence, inequality, and sexuality. Gender and Women&#x27;s studies scholar Dana E. Goldman explains that Ivy Queen&#x27;s engagement with gender throughout her lyrics encourages dialogue to challenge gender norms, especially since male singers tend to perform Reggaeton more frequently and often express a desire for unattainable women or lament heartbreak.

=== Regional Mexican Music ===
Regional Mexican music encompasses diverse Spanish language genres originating in Mexico, such as mariachi, banda, duranguense, nortenos, grupo, corridos, and more. These genres hold significant popularity among Spanish-speaking audiences. They are deeply rooted in Mexican identity and cultural traditions. Each genre serves as a platform for various forms of activism, addressing issues such as gun violence, immigration, drug crime, governmental matters in Mexico and the United States, and corruption through their powerful lyrics.

==== Los Tigres Del Norte ====
Los Tigres Del Norte is California-based norteño musical group that has used their platform on a variety of issues. The group consisted of four brothers and their cousin. Originally undocumented immigrants, they formed the group in 1968 while residing in San Jose, California. They initially arrived in the United States with temporary visas to perform for incarcerated individuals, which marked the beginning of their journey as a grupo.

In 2013, Los Tigres del Norte, the renowned musical group, took the spotlight at a significant immigration rally in Washington D.C., advocating for immigration reform. During the rally, they performed their popular songs &quot;La Jaula de Oro,&quot; &quot;Vivir En Las Sombras,&quot; and &quot;Tres Veces Mojado.&quot; It&#x27;s worth noting that this rally was not their only one, as they also organized an immigration rally at the National Mall in Hollywood in October of the same year. During the rally, their aim was to consistently address their themes. After each song, they engaged in discussions to reflect upon the messages conveyed.

One of their biggest hits is &quot;La Jaula de Oro,&quot; meaning &quot;The Gilded Cage.&quot; This song has been performed numerous times and delves into the life of an immigrant and their American-born child who feels disconnected from their cultural heritage. The powerful message conveyed is, &quot;What value does money hold when I feel trapped in this promising nation?&quot;

Los Tigres Del Norte also tackle the topic of prison reform in their music. In 2019, they gave a memorable performance inside Folsom Prison, located in California, which led to the creation of a song called &quot;La Prisión de Folsom&quot; (Folsom Prison). This performance was influenced by the legendary musician Johnny Cash. It is worth noting that the majority of the inmates present during the performance were Hispanic and Black, reflecting the demographic composition of the entire prison system. Los Tigres Del Norte documented their experience at Folsom Prison in a Netflix documentary titled &quot;Los Tigres del Norte at Folsom Prison.&quot; The documentary explores the grupo&#x27;s impact on inmates, both prior to and following their time in prison.

==Rock music==
Many rock artists, as varied as Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Bruce Springsteen, Little Steven, Rage Against the Machine, Radiohead, Manic Street Preachers, Megadeth, Enter Shikari, Architects, Muse, System of a Down, Sonic Boom Six and Drive-By Truckers have had openly political messages in their music. The use of political lyrics and the taking of political stances by rock musicians can be traced back to the 1960s counterculture, specifically the influence of the early career of Bob Dylan, itself shaped by the politicised folk revival.

===1960s–70s counterculture===
During the 1960s and early 1970s counterculture era, musicians such as John Lennon commonly expressed protest themes in their music, for example on the Plastic Ono Band&#x27;s 1969 single &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot;. Lennon later devoted an entire album to politics and wrote the song Imagine, widely considered to be a peace anthem. Its lyrics invoke a world without religion, national borders or private property.
In 1962–63, Bob Dylan sang about the evils of war, racism and poverty on his trademark political albums &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot; and &quot;The Times They Are a-Changin&#x27;&quot; (released in 1964), popularising the cause of the Civil Rights Movement. Dylan was influenced by the folk revival, as well as by the Beat writers, and the political beliefs of the young generation of the era. In turn, while Dylan&#x27;s political phase comes under the &#x27;folk&#x27; category, he was known as a rock artist from 1965 and remained associated with an anti-establishment stance that influenced other musicians – such as the British Invasion bands – and the rock music audience, by broadening the spectrum of subjects that could be addressed in popular song.

The MC5 (Motor City 5) came out of the Detroit, Michigan underground scene of the late 1960s, and embodied an aggressive evolution of garage rock which was often fused with socio-political and countercultural lyrics, such as in the songs &quot;Motor City Is Burning&quot;, (a John Lee Hooker cover adapting the story of the Detroit Race Riot (1943) to the 1967 12th Street Detroit Riot), and &quot;American Ruse&quot; (which discusses U.S. police brutality as well as pollution, prison, materialism and rebellion). They had ties to radical leftist groups such as Up Against the Wall Motherfuckers and John Sinclair&#x27;s White Panther Party. MC5 was the only band to perform a set before the August 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, as part of the Yippies&#x27; Festival of Life where an infamous riot subsequently broke out between police and students protesting the April assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Vietnam War.

Other rock groups that conveyed specific political messages in the late 1960s/early 1970s – often in regard to the Vietnam War – include The Fugs, Country Joe and the Fish, Jefferson Airplane, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Third World War, while some bands, such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Hawkwind, referenced political issues occasionally and in a more observational than engaged way, e.g. in songs like &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;, &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; and &quot;Urban Guerrilla&quot;.

===Punk rock===
Notable punk rock bands, such as Crass, Conflict, Sex Pistols, The Clash, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, Refused, American Standards, Discharge, MDC, Aus-Rotten, Billy Talent, Anti-Flag, and Leftöver Crack have used political and sometimes controversial lyrics that attack the establishment, sexism, capitalism, racism, speciesism, colonialism, and other phenomena they see as sources of social problems.

Since the late 1970s, punk rock has been associated with various left-wing or anti-establishment ideologies, including anarchism and socialism. Punk&#x27;s DIY culture held an attraction for some on the Left, suggesting affinity with the ideals of workers&#x27; control, and empowerment of the powerless (though it is arguable that the punk movement&#x27;s partial focus on apathy towards the establishment, combined with the fact that in many situations, punk rock music generated income for major record companies, and the notable similarities between some strains of anarchism and capitalism, meant that the punk movement ran contrary to left-wing ideologies) – and the genre as a whole came, largely through the Sex Pistols, to be associated with anarchism. The sincerity of the early punk bands has been questioned – some critics saw their referencing of revolutionary politics as a provocative pose rather than an ideology – but bands such as Crass and Dead Kennedys later emerged who held strong anarchist views, and over time this association strengthened, as they went on to influence other bands in the UK anarcho-punk and US hardcore subgenres, respectively.

The Sex Pistols song &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was banned from broadcast by the BBC in 1977 due to its presumed anti-Royalism, partly due to its apparent equation of the monarchy with a &quot;fascist regime&quot;. The following year, the release of debut Crass album The Feeding Of the 5000 was initially obstructed when pressing plant workers refused to produce it due to sacrilegious lyrical content. Crass later faced court charges of obscenity related to their Penis Envy album, as the Dead Kennedys later did over their Frankenchrist album artwork.

The Clash are regarded as pioneers of political punk, and were seen to represent a progressive, socialistic worldview compared to the apparently anti-social or nihilistic attack of many early punk bands. Partly inspired by 1960s protest music such as the MC5, their stance influenced other first and second wave punk/new wave bands such as The Jam, The Ruts, Stiff Little Fingers, Angelic Upstarts, TRB and Newtown Neurotics, and inspired a lyrical focus on subjects such as racial tension, unemployment, class resentment, urban alienation and police violence, as well as imperialism. Partially credited with aligning punk and reggae, The Clash&#x27;s anti-racism helped to cement punk&#x27;s anti-fascist politics, and they famously headlined the first joint Rock Against Racism (RAR)/Anti Nazi League (ANL) carnival in Hackney, London, in April 1978. The RAR/ANL campaign is credited with helping to destroy the UK National Front as a credible political force, aided by the support received from punk and reggae bands.

Many punk musicians, such as Vic Bondi (Articles of Faith), Joey Keithley (DOA), Tim McIlrath (Rise Against), The Crucifucks, Bad Religion, The Proletariat, Against All Authority, Dropkick Murphys and Crashdog have held and expressed left-wing views. Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra, as well as T.S.O.L. frontman Jack Grisham, have run as candidates for public office under left-wing platforms. However, some punk bands have expressed more populist and conservative opinions, and an ambiguous form of patriotism, beginning in the U.S. with many of the groups associated with 1980s New York hardcore, and prior to that in the UK with a small section of the Oi! movement.

An extremely small minority of punk rock bands, exemplified by (1980s-era) Skrewdriver and Skullhead, have held far-right and anti-communist stances, and were consequently reviled in the broader, largely Leftist punk subculture.

==== Latino Rock/Punk ====
Music within the &quot;Rock&quot; genre have been linked to left-leaning political views, including views against racism and xenophobia. Latin punk became a movement within the Rock genre. Within the genre, issues that are prevalent specifically within the Latino communities were being discussed. The issues pertained to the violation of immigrant rights, including within the workforce. Many musicians within the genre paid homage to their cultural roots and adopted philosophies such as those that arose from the Zapatista Uprising.

The movement shed light on the Chicano/Latino scene within their communities. This became a form of protest against the xenophobia that exists against the community in the US

===== Rage Against the Machine and Tigres del Norte =====

Lead singer of Rage Against the Machine, Zach De La Rocha is introduced by Los Tigres del Norte for their MTV Unplugged performance in 2011. Together, they perform a song of Los Tigres del Norte, &quot;“&quot;Somos mas americanos.&quot;&quot; Zach De La Rocha is introduced as someone who “fights for the rights of us all.” Rage against the Machine is known for having socio-political commentary in their music as well as Los Tigres del Norte. Rage against the Machine&#x27;s &quot;political views and activism are central to the band&#x27;s message.&quot; Zach De La Rocha has described being interested in &quot;...spreading those ideas through art, because music has the power to cross borders, to break military sieges and to establish real dialogue.&quot; Los Tigres del Norte also have a history of displaying their political views through their music. From supporting LGBT+ rights, prison abolition, and immigrant rights.

Together, they perform ‘&quot;Somos Más Americanos.’&quot; Los Tigres Del Norte being Regional Mexican music that dates back to the 60s while Zach&#x27;s musical background coming from a heavy metal and rap background which originated in the 90s.

The performance gives historical and social commentary on the xenophobia and racism that is targeted against Mexican and Chicanx folks in the US. Both the group and Zach perform the song whilst adding anedoctes about the US government.

One of the introductory lyrics in the song is “I have to remind them that I didn&#x27;t cross the border, the border crossed me.” These words directly reference US and Mexico history. Specifically to how a significant amount of what is now considered the Southwest US, was once Mexico. These words have also become a slogan for many Latino movements and organizations in the US who aim to fight against xenophobic systems that target immigrants. The lyrics that end the song are “&quot;Somos mas americanos que todititos los Gringos.&quot;&quot; Meaning, &quot;we are more American than all of the White people.&quot;

===Rock the Vote===
Rock the Vote is an American 501(c)(3) non-profit, non-partisan organization founded in Los Angeles in 1990 by Jeff Ayeroff for the purposes of political advocacy. Rock the Vote works to engage youth in the political process by incorporating the entertainment community and youth culture into its activities. Rock the Vote&#x27;s stated mission is to &quot;build the political clout and engagement of young people in order to achieve progressive change in our country.&quot;

==Hip hop==
Hip hop music has been associated with protest since 1982, when &quot;The Message&quot; by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five became known as the first prominent rap record to make a serious “social statement”. However the first political rap release has been credited to Brother D and the Collective Effort&#x27;s 1980 single “How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?” which called the USA a “police state” and rapped about historical injustices such as slavery and ethnic cleansing.

Later in the decade hip hop band Public Enemy became &quot;perhaps the most well-known and influential political rap group&quot; and released a series of records whose message and success &quot;directed hip-hop toward an explicitly self-aware, pro-black consciousness that became the culture&#x27;s signature throughout the next decade,&quot; helping to inspire a wave of politicised hip hop by artists such as X Clan, Poor Righteous Teachers, Brand Nubian, 2 Black 2 Strong and Paris.

Eminem&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;Kamikaze,&quot; contained many political messages, most of them revolving around his disapproval of Donald Trump being elected President of the United States. He stated he was willing to lose fans over this criticism and rapped: &quot;And any fan of mine/who&#x27;s a supporter of his/I&#x27;m drawing in the sand a line/you&#x27;re either for or against,&quot;

During Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign, Kanye West took the opportunity to support the Republican candidate by urging his fans to vote for Trump. Although West has historically been against the Republican administrations, he has been one of Donald Trumps most vocal supporters. On April 27, 2018, Kanye West and fellow rapper, T.I., released a collaboration called &quot;Ye vs. the People&quot; that consisted of West and T.I.&#x27;s opposing political views. The song, a conversation between the two rappers, became popular not for its musical touch, but because of the courage West and T.I. showed by releasing a controversial song in a time of high political disagreement.

==Reggae==
Jamaican Reggae of the 1970s and the 1980s is an example of influential and powerful interaction between music and politics. A top figure-head in this music was Bob Marley. Though Marley was not in favor of politics, through his politicized lyrics he was seen as a political figure. In 1978 Bob Marley&#x27;s One Love Peace Concert brought Prime Minister Michael Manley and the opposition leader Edward Seaga together (leaders connected to notorious rival gang leaders, Bucky Marshall and Claude Massop, respectively), to join hands with Marley during the performance; this was the &quot;longest and most political reggae concert ever staged, and one of the most remarkable musical events recorded.&quot; Throughout this period many reggae musicians played for and spoke or sung in support of Manley&#x27;s People&#x27;s National Party, a campaign credited with helping the PNP&#x27;s victory in the 1972 and 1976 elections.

==Popular music==
Popular music found throughout the world contains political messages such as those concerning social issues and racism. For example, Lady Gaga&#x27;s song &quot;Born This Way&quot; has often been known as the international gay anthem, as it discusses homosexuality in a positive light and expresses the idea that it is natural. Furthermore, the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina received a great political response from the hip hop music community. The content of the music changed into a response showing the complex dynamic of the community, especially the black community, while also acting a sometimes contradictory protest of how the disaster was handled in the aftermath. This topic even reached beyond the locality of New Orleans, as the issue of the disaster and racism was mentioned by other rappers from other regions of the country.

Pop music is common for its sensationalized and mass-produced uplifting beats. Many artists take advantage of their large followings to spread awareness of political issues in their music. Similar to Lady Gaga&#x27;s &quot;Born This Way,&quot; Macklemore&#x27;s song &quot;Same Love&quot; also expresses support and homage to the LGBTQ+ community. Furthermore, Beyoncé&#x27;s album &quot;Lemonade&quot; has been hailed as awe-inspiring and eye-opening with many of the songs addressing political issues such as racism, stereotyping, police brutality, and infidelity. 
These songs, aside from being catchy and uplifting, discuss serious issues in a lighthearted and simplified manner allowing people to understand while also commonly being influenced by the current political climate such as the violent attacks on the Bataclan Theater in Paris and the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando.

==Country music==

American country music contains numerous images of traditional values and family and religious life, as well as patriotic themes. Songs such as Merle Haggard&#x27;s &quot;The Fightin&#x27; Side of Me&quot; and &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; have been perceived as patriotic songs showing an &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality directed at the counterculture or &quot;hippies&quot; and the anti-war crowd, though these were actually misconceptions by listeners who failed to understand their satirical nature.

Many American country songs addressed political and cultural views in the 1960s and 1970s, with mainstream and independent country artists releasing singles that conveyed support for conservative candidates or military action, anti-communist statements, or, in some cases, anti-hippie sentiments often framed as humorous put-downs. These tropes have continued in such songs as Toby Keith&#x27;s &quot;Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)&quot; in 2002 and Bryan Lewis&#x27;s &quot;I Think My Dog&#x27;s a Democrat&quot; in 2016.

More recent American country songs containing political messages include Keith Urban&#x27;s &quot;Female&quot; which details the psychological and emotional impact on women of sexist language, slut-shaming, and lack of representation in politics. The lyrics of Carrie Underwood&#x27;s 2018 song &quot;Love Wins&quot; also identifies themes of prejudice, hatred, and politics. Through this song, Underwood expresses the idea that the best way to close the political divide and strengthen what she sees to be a broken world is through unity, loving each other, and working together in times of crisis.

Country artist Kacey Musgraves integrates politics into her lyrics, speaking about gay rights and cannabis consumption. Her song &quot;Follow Your Arrow&quot; is considered to be a radical perspective on same-sex marriage, in that it differs from the conservative point of view that is normally found in country music.

African American country rapper Cowboy Troy, the stage name of Troy Lee Coleman III, incorporates real-life problems into his music, calling for societal change. He sheds light on concepts like class analysis, gender issues, and popular narratives about the &quot;white&quot; working class. One of his songs, &quot;I Play Chicken With The Train,&quot; acknowledges conservative and progressive ideas that tend to be brought up in presidential elections.

Although race is a rarely addressed topic in country music, some artists have made an effort to approach this theme in their songs. Brad Paisley&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Wheelhouse&quot; included the track &quot;Accidental Racist&quot;, which became controversial, generating many negative reviews. Will Hermes, in his critique in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, commented: &quot;It&#x27;s probably not going to win any awards for songcraft and rapping, but in the wake of movies like &quot;Django Unchained&quot; and &quot;Lincoln&quot;, it shows how fraught racial dialogue remains in America.&quot; Paisley stated, &quot;This song was meant to generate discussion among the people who listen to my albums.&quot;

==Classical music==
Beethoven&#x27;s third symphony was originally called &quot;Bonaparte&quot;. In 1804 Napoleon crowned himself emperor, whereupon Beethoven rescinded the dedication. The symphony was renamed &quot;Heroic Symphony composed to Celebrate the Memory of a Great Man&quot;.

Verdi&#x27;s chorus of Hebrew slaves in the opera &quot;Nabucco&quot; is a kind of rallying-cry for Italians to throw off the yoke of Austrian domination (in the north) and French domination (near Rome)—the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;. Following unification, Verdi was awarded a seat in the national parliament.

In late nineteenth century England, choral music was performed by mass choirs of workers and much music was written for them, by, for example, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and Ralph Vaughan Williams. When the young Vaughan Williams wondered what kind of music to write, Hubert Parry advised him to &quot;write choral music as befits an Englishman and a democrat&quot;. Others, including Frederick Delius and Vaughan Williams&#x27;s friend Gustav Holst also wrote choral works, often using the words of Walt Whitman.

Richard Taruskin of the University of California accused John Adams of &quot;romanticizing terrorists&quot; in his opera &quot;The Death of Klinghoffer&quot; (1991).

American classical composer Miguel del Aguila has written over 130 works many of which center on social issues such as the genocide of Native Americans during the European conquest, and the Guerra Sucia victims. More recent works like Bindfold Music deal with social injustice in contemporary US society.

===In the Soviet Union===
RAPM (The Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) was formed in the early 1920s. In 1929 Stalin gave them his backing. Shostakovich had dedicated his first symphony to Mikhail Kvadri. In 1929 Kvardi was arrested and executed. In an article in &quot;The Worker and the Theatre&quot;, Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;Tahiti Trot&quot; (used with the ballet &quot;The Golden Age&quot;) was criticised; Ivan Yershov claimed it was part of &quot;ideology harmful to the proletariat&quot;&quot;. Shostakovich&#x27;s response was to write his third symphony, &quot;The First of May&quot; (1929) to express &quot;the festive mood of peaceful construction&quot;.

Prokofiev wrote music to order for the Soviet Union, including &quot;Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution&quot; (1937). Khachaturian&#x27;s ballet &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1954/6) concerns gladiator slaves who rebel against their former Roman masters. It was seen as a metaphor for the overthrow of the Czar. Similarly Prokofiev&#x27;s music for the film &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; concerns the invasion of Teutonic knights into the Baltic States. It was seen as a metaphor for the Nazi invasion of the USSR. In general Soviet music was neo-romantic while Fascist music was neo-classical.

===Music in Nazi Germany===
Stravinsky stated in 1930, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe anyone venerates Mussolini more than I&quot;; however by 1943 Stravinsky was banned in Nazi Germany because he had chosen to live in the USA. Beginning in 1940, Carl Orff&#x27;s cantata &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; was performed at Nazi Party functions, and acquired the status of a quasi-official anthem. In 1933 Berlin Radio issued a formal ban on the broadcasting of jazz. However, it was still possible to hear swing music played by German bands. This was because of the moderating influence of Goebbels, who knew the value of entertaining the troops. In the period 1933–45 the music of Gustav Mahler, a Jewish Austrian, virtually disappeared from the concert performances of the Berlin Philharmonic. Richard Strauss&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Schweigsame Frau&quot; (The Silent Woman) was banned from 1935 to 1945 because the librettist, Stefan Zweig, was a Jew.

==White Power music==
Racist music or white power music is music associated with and promoting neo-Nazism and white supremacy ideologies. Although musicologists point out that many, if not most early cultures had songs to promote themselves and denigrate any perceived enemies, the origins of Racist music is traced to the 1970s. By 2001 there were many music genres with &#x27;white power rock&#x27; the most commonly represented band type, followed by National Socialist black metal. &#x27;Racist country music&#x27; is mainly an American phenomena while Germany, Great Britain, and Sweden have higher concentration of white power bands. Other music genres include &#x27;fascist experimental music&#x27; and &#x27;racist folk music&#x27;. Contemporary white-supremacist groups include &quot;subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music.&quot; According to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission &quot;racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits.&quot; The news documentary &quot;VH1 News Special: Inside Hate Rock&quot; (2002) noted that Racist music (also called &#x27;Hate music&#x27; and &#x27;Skinhead rock&#x27;) is &quot;a breeding ground for home-grown terrorists.&quot; In 2004 a neo-Nazi record company launched &quot;Project Schoolyard&quot; to distribute free CDs of the music into the hands of up to 100,000 teenagers throughout the U.S., their website stated, &quot;We just don&#x27;t entertain racist kids ... We create them.&quot; Brian Houghton, of the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, said that Racist music was a great recruiting tool, &quot;Through music ... to grab these kids, teach them to be racists and hook them for life.&quot;

== By country ==

Aware of the motivational power of music, politicians across the world seek to incorporate different songs into their campaigns. However, the viewpoints of the musicians and the politicians using their music occasionally clash. In addition to protest songs created specifically to call attention to matters of social change, musicians around the world resist politicians. Governments and leaders also assert their resistance to critical musicians in a variety of ways. Within each different national and cultural context, musician resistance and politician response is a unique relationship.

=== Brazil ===
Since his election as the President of Brazil in 2018, Jair Bolsonaro had become an increasingly controversial leader. Much like rightist contemporaries Donald Trump and Narendra Modi, Bolsonaro has been described as both a populist and nationalist. While Bolsonaro directly supports far-right policies on gay rights and gun ownership, more moderate conservatives also claim that he supports their interests. To gain support from Brazil&#x27;s conservative voters, Bolsonaro&#x27;s speeches were heavily nationalistic and patriotic. While Bolsonaro&#x27;s direct appeals to the people were more limited within his national addresses, he emphasized a prideful brand of Brazilian nationalism. As a figure whose policies and actions have been deeply polarizing and divisive, Bolsonaro became a main source of scorn and criticism for Brazilian musicians both domestic and abroad.

Musician Caetano Veloso, who was exiled during Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship that lasted from the 1964 to 1985, called Bolsonaro&#x27;s heavy-handed nationalistic rhetoric and leadership “an utter nightmare.” While Veloso&#x27;s brand of music is not protest music, he takes the opportunity to speak out and use his visibility for resistance. In August 2020, Veloso joined a chorus of prominent Brazilian figures in mocking Bolsonaro for his perceived role in an embezzlement and money laundering scheme.

While some Brazilian artists like Veloso resisted mainly from their social media accounts, Brazil has a rich history of protest music against its former authoritarian dictatorship regime that is continued by many contemporary artists. Artists from all over the country had found ways to resist, criticize, and allude to Bolsonaro in their works. Troubadour Chico César took a direct approach by asserting that Bolsonaro&#x27;s supporters were fascists, composer Manu da Cuíca veiled his criticism included a warning about Bolsonaro as one of the dangerous “gun-toting messiahs,” and singer Marina Iris indirectly worked in criticism against the regime as persistent themes of angst and frustration toward the current state of Brazil. These customary forms of Brazilian music, rooted in indigenous musical forms, are a key form of anti-status quo music.
In response to the resistance, instead of adopting music like Trump or relying on the support of his followers like Modi, Bolsonaro drastically cut the public support and resources for musicians, film-makers, and visual artists. Many artists viewed this act as payback for their resistance. However, several right-wing Brazilian rappers took it upon themselves in the music scene to defend and support Bolsonaro.

=== India ===
After the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Narendra Modi was sworn in Prime Minister of India. Modi, who is notable for this effective nationalistic appeal to the Indian people, quickly began to centralize power and subject both civil and foreign non-governmental organization to scrutiny.

With Modi&#x27;s populist support and increasing governmental power, musicians face a unique social and political landscape in their options for resistance. In May 2020, an arrest warrant was brought against singer Mainul Ahsan Noble for making derogatory comments toward Modi on Facebook. While the lawsuit was filed by a private Indian citizen who “could not accept such defamatory remarks against the PM of [India].” With India&#x27;s populist turn, criticism and resistance against politicians is now riskier for musicians. The late singer S.P. Balasubrahmanyam carefully resisted the actions of Modi when he suggested that artists from Southern India were subject to different restrictions than Bollywood artists at Modi&#x27;s 2019 Change Within gathering. Where Noble&#x27;s overt comments ignited anger and legal action, Balasubrahmanyam&#x27;s muted criticism did not draw the same response. Because Modi&#x27;s populist policy choices strongly suggest to the Indian people that he is concerned with welfare of the everyday citizen, more citizens come to his aid and resistance to Modi becomes more difficult for contemporary Indian musicians.

However, criticism of Modi may be less careful abroad. Desi-American punk The Kominas and several other South Asian performers organized an anti-Modi benefit in New York City to coincide with a Trump administration-organized, pro-Modi event in Houston. The New York City pro-Kashmir opposition event triggered attacks and condemnation from some Indians online, but no international legal actions against the bands and artists involved. Despite the opposition event highlighting human rights abuses regarding the military lockdown of Kashmir, the populist view of Modi as a purifier of corruption and defender of the Indian people persists among much of India. To further expand their musical acts of resistance, the Kominas are considering bringing the punk anti-Modi opposition events to different countries and even perhaps New Delhi.

In the United States, musicians including Neil Young, the Dropkick Murphys and Explosions in the Sky have taken issue with or action against such politicians as President Donald Trump, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. These conflicts between popular musicians and politicians in the United States are common in the election cycle, but play out differently.

Trump used Young&#x27;s song &quot;Rockin in the Free World&quot; from the beginning of his presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2015. While Young argued Trump was not authorized to use the song in his campaign, a Trump spokesperson stated the song was legally obtained through a license with ASCAP and that the campaign &quot;will continue to [use his song] regardless of Neil&#x27;s political views.&quot; And though the song itself, from 1989, may appear to be an endorsement of the American lifestyle, closer examination reveals criticism of the George H. W. Bush administration. This suggests that the effect of music in a political campaign cannot be limited to lyrics alone. Despite the song&#x27;s pointed words and Young&#x27;s continued resistance, the Trump campaign began using the song again in 2018 in his presidential reelection campaign.

Similarly, in 2015, Scott Walker utilized the Dropkick Murphys&#x27; popular cover of Woody Guthrie’s &quot;I&#x27;m Shipping Up to Boston&quot; at a political event in Iowa. Owing heavily to disagreements over issues like unions, the band tweeted &quot;please stop using our music in any way ... we literally hate you!!!&quot; to Walker. While there was no threat of legal action, the band took to social media to distance themselves from Walker and resist his usage of their song.

Some musicians have effectively used copyright law to resist the political use of their music. When Ted Cruz included the Explosions in the Sky song &quot;Your Hand in Mine&quot; in an endorsement video for Texas Governor Greg Abbott, the band tweeted they were &quot;absolutely not okay with it.&quot; The band&#x27;s label, Temporary Residence, forced the Cruz campaign to remove the video due to a violation of U.S. Copyright Law. Legally, politicians can license music without consulting the artists themselves through deals with performance rights organizations. Where the Trump campaign sidestepped consulting Young and legally licensed &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; from such an organization (ASCAP), Cruz&#x27;s effort did neither.

In the United States there is also a long and complex history of public schools instilling support for the military through their musical activities, and of music teachers either endorsing or resisting these tendencies. Musicologists have noted the impact of militarism in US society, arguing that &quot;militarism endangers music education&quot; and that although military models are inappropriate for the education of schoolchildren in a democracy, there is evidence that &quot;In the United States, we find an array of music education partnership projects with the military that would be unthinkable in many other countries.

<text>Different Class (released in Japan as Common People) is the fifth studio album by English rock band Pulp, released on 30 October 1995 by Island Records.

The album was a critical and commercial success, entering the UK Albums Chart at number one and winning the 1996 Mercury Music Prize. It included four top-ten singles in the UK, &quot;Common People&quot;, &quot;Sorted for E&#x27;s &amp; Wizz&quot;, &quot;Disco 2000&quot; and &quot;Something Changed&quot;. &quot;Different Class&quot; has been certified four times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and had sold 1.33 million copies in the United Kingdom as of 2020. Widely acclaimed as among the greatest albums of the Britpop era, in 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the album at number six in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 162 in their 2020 revised version of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

==Background and release==
The album was released in the UK at the height of Britpop. It followed from the success of their breakthrough album &quot;His &#x27;n&#x27; Hers&quot; the previous year. Two of the singles on the album – &quot;Common People&quot; (which reached number two on the UK Singles Chart) and &quot;Disco 2000&quot; (which reached number seven) – were especially notable, and helped propel Pulp to nationwide fame. A &quot;deluxe edition&quot; of &quot;Different Class&quot; was released on 11 September 2006. It contains a second disc of B-sides, demos and rarities.

The inspiration for the title came to frontman Jarvis Cocker in Smashing, a club night that ran during the early 1990s in Eve&#x27;s Club on Regent Street in London. Cocker had a friend who used the phrase &quot;different class&quot; to describe something that was &quot;in a class of its own&quot;. Cocker liked the double meaning, with its allusions to the British social class system, which was a theme of some of the songs on the album. A message on the back of the record also references this idea:

==Artwork==
The sleeve design was created by Blue Source. Initial copies of the CD and vinyl album came with six double-sided inserts of alternative cover art, depicting cardboard cutouts of the band photographed in various situations. A sticker invited the listener to &quot;Choose your own front cover&quot;. In all standard copies thereafter these 12 individual covers made up the CD booklet, with the wedding photograph used as the actual cover.

In an interview with BBC Radio 6 Music presenter Chris Hawkins on 8 April 2014, Dom O&#x27;Connor, the groom featured in the wedding photograph cover art, recalled how the album cover had come about:

Apart from the bride and groom, the photograph features the parents of both the bride and the groom, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s two brothers, his two best friends and his wife&#x27;s best friend. O&#x27;Connor also told Hawkins that he and his family had no further contact with the photographer after the day of the wedding, and had no idea that the photographs would be used for the album cover until his mother saw a poster advertising the album in an HMV record store. He later saw a billboard poster of the album cover while he was out shopping. Pulp&#x27;s record company at the time did not pay the family for the use of their picture, but when Pulp reformed in 2011 Rough Trade paid for the family members to see Pulp play live. O&#x27;Connor said, &quot;Rough Trade very kindly sent us a signed copy of the photo that Jarvis had signed last year, just saying &#x27;Thank you very much Dom and Sharon for letting us crash your wedding&#x27;, which I thought was a really nice touch actually&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Different Class&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics in the UK. In the &quot;NME&quot; John Mulvey summarised the record as &quot;funny, phenomenally nasty, genuinely subversive, and, of course, hugely, flamingly POP!... &quot;Different Class&quot; is a deft, atmospheric, occasionally stealthy and frequently booming, confident record.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; awarded the album its star rating of &quot;bloody essential&quot;, and its critic Simon Reynolds observed that &quot;the album&#x27;s title alone announces that Cocker&#x27;s broadened his scope, has another axe to grind: social antagonism&quot;, and stated that Pulp was &quot;not so much the jewel in Britpop&#x27;s crown, more like the single solitary band who validate the whole sorry enterprise&quot;. In &quot;Q&quot; Robert Yates felt that &quot;the range of &quot;Different Class&quot; is impressive: tracks such as [&quot;Live Bed Show&quot; and &quot;F.E.E.L.I.N.G.C.A.L.L.E.D.L.O.V.E.&quot;] render more redundant than ever the view of Pulp as kitsch&quot;, while in &quot;Vox&quot; Keith Cameron awarded the album eight out of ten and wrote that &quot;no other Pulp album of recent years froths around the mouth so unselfconsciously... Pulp have managed to elevate their grandiose, popoid vision-thing to new and greater heights, without crashing into the realms of extreme fantasy.&quot; In &quot;Mojo&quot; Bob Stanley stated, &quot;You&#x27;d have to be a fool or a low-fi obsessive not to concede that it&#x27;s easily the closest that Pulp have come to realising their potential... &quot;Different Class&quot; is curiously sparse yet lush enough in all the right places, warm and soulful where unnecessary electro-clutter used to be&quot;, and concluded, &quot;Arguments about Blur versus Oasis are irrelevant. Pulp are in a different class.&quot; &quot;Select&quot; ranked the album at number one in its end-of-year list of the 50 best albums of 1995.

&quot;Different Class&quot; was released in the US on 27 February 1996, and received equally enthusiastic reviews from American critics. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a brilliant, eccentric, irresistible pop album about fucking and fucking up... The record is rife with sexual combat and bitter recrimination.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Even in a truly classless society, sex separates the men from the boys, the women from the girls, the romantics from the mere runters. &quot;Different Class&quot; is the sound of Jarvis Cocker keeping score – with delicious accuracy.&quot; Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that &quot;1996 won&#x27;t produce a more indispensable song than &quot;Common People&quot;, and described the album as neither Blur nor Oasis, but &quot;Culture Club with lyrics... Smart and glam, swish and het, its jangle subsumed beneath swelling crescendos or nagging keybs and its rhythms steeped in rave&quot;. In &quot;Spin&quot; Barry Walters described the album as &quot;songs about naughty infidelities, sexless marriages, grown-up teenage crushes, twisted revenge fantasies, obsessive voyeurism and useless raves; songs that demand your full attention and deserve it&quot;.

===Legacy===
In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic declared that &quot;Different Class&quot; &quot;blows away all their previous albums, including the fine &quot;His &#x27;n&#x27; Hers&quot;. Pulp don&#x27;t stray from their signature formula at all – it&#x27;s still grandly theatrical, synth-spiked pop with new wave and disco flourishes, but they have mastered it here. Not only are the melodies and hooks significantly catchier and more immediate, the music explores more territory ... Jarvis Cocker&#x27;s lyrics take two themes, sex and social class, and explore a number of different avenues in bitingly clever ways. As well as perfectly capturing the behavior of his characters, Cocker grasps the nuances of language, creating a dense portrait of suburban and working-class life.&quot; Writing about the album in 2011, BBC Music stated that &quot;over 15 years since its release [it] continues to reward the listener with some of the smartest, slinkiest, sauciest, spectacular pop songs of a decade that was, looking back, not that brilliant once the bucket hats and ironic anoraks are whipped away.&quot;

&quot;PopMatters&quot;″ retrospective review in 2004 opined that &quot;nearly nine years after its release, &quot;Different Class&quot; has aged very well, possessing that timeless quality that is present in all classic albums, but is still obviously a product of its time, a snapshot of mid-&#x27;90s life in the UK. Along with Blur&#x27;s &quot;Parklife&quot;, it remains the high point of the Britpop era; music, lyrics, production, artwork, it&#x27;s as perfect as it gets.&quot; Reviewing the 2006 deluxe edition, Garry Mulholland of &quot;Q&quot; stated that the album &quot;defined the mood of the day&quot;, while &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; described &quot;Different Class&quot; as &quot;easily the best album of its year of release and arguably the best album from the Britpop era&quot; and went on to call it &quot;a certifiable masterpiece that not only lived up to the sky-high expectations heaped upon it with appalling ease, but surpassed them.&quot;

===Accolades===
The album was the winner of the 1996 Mercury Music Prize. In 1997, it was ranked at number 34 out of 100 in a &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Classic FM. In 1998 &quot;Q&quot; readers voted &quot;Different Class&quot; the 37th greatest album of all time; a repeat poll in 2006 put it at number 85. In 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 46 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2005 it was voted number 70 in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest Albums&quot;. In 2006 &quot;British Hit Singles &amp; Albums&quot; and &quot;NME&quot; organised a poll in which 40,000 people worldwide voted for the 100 best albums ever and &quot;Different Class&quot; was placed at number 54 on the list. The album was ranked at number 35 on &quot;Spin&quot;″s &quot;The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985–2014)&quot; list.

Released in 1995 at the height of the Britpop era, it is often considered an album which best defines the era and has featured at the number one position on several best Britpop albums polls, including &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, BuzzFeed, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, &quot;Spin&quot;. Exactly twenty years on from its release, &quot;Complex&quot; magazine declared &quot;Different Class&quot; as &quot;the most important Britpop album.&quot; Having not featured in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, the album was ranked at number 162 in their revised 2020 list. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
By September 1996, worldwide sales were estimated at 1.5 million copies by the record label, including 40,000 copies in the US. The album has been certified quadruple platinum in the UK, and as of September 2020 has accrued physical, digital, and streaming equivalent sales of 1.33 million, one-tenth of which were in its first week of sales. By the end of its second week, the album had been certified platinum in the UK with 300,000 copies sold.

<text>In organic chemistry, a ketose is a monosaccharide containing one ketone () group per molecule. The simplest ketose is dihydroxyacetone (), which has only three carbon atoms. It is the only ketose with no optical activity. All monosaccharide ketoses are reducing sugars, because they can tautomerize into aldoses via an enediol intermediate, and the resulting aldehyde group can be oxidised, for example in the Tollens&#x27; test or Benedict&#x27;s test. Ketoses that are bound into glycosides, for example in the case of the fructose moiety of sucrose, are nonreducing sugars.

==Chemistry==
Ketoses and aldoses can be chemically differentiated through Seliwanoff&#x27;s test, where the sample is heated with acid and resorcinol. The test relies on the dehydration reaction which occurs more quickly in ketoses, so that while aldoses react slowly, producing a light pink color, ketoses react more quickly and strongly to produce a dark red color. Ketoses can isomerize to aldoses through the Lobry-de Bruyn-van Ekenstein transformation.

==Examples of ketoses==

All ketoses listed here are 2-ketoses, in other words, the carbonyl group is on the second carbon atom from the end:
* Trioses: dihydroxyacetone
* Tetroses: erythrulose
* Pentoses: ribulose, xylulose
* Hexoses: fructose, psicose, sorbose, tagatose
* Heptoses: sedoheptulose
* Octoses: -&quot;manno&quot;-octulose (the basis for KDO)
* Nonoses: -&quot;glycero&quot;--&quot;galacto&quot;-nonulose (the basis for neuraminic acid)

<text>&quot;Justify My Love&quot; is a song released as a single by American singer Madonna. It does not appear on any of her studio albums, but is included on her first greatest hits album, &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990). The song was written by Lenny Kravitz and Ingrid Chavez, with additional lyrics by Madonna; Kravitz also handled the production alongside André Betts. It was released as the lead single from &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; on November 6, 1990, by Sire and Warner Bros. Records. Initially, Chavez was not credited on the song; this led to a lawsuit against Kravitz which resulted in an out-of-court settlement. Influenced by hip hop, dance, trip hop, and experimental pop, it features spoken word vocals by Madonna touching on sexual fantasies and implying the position of a woman as the one sexually in control.

The song&#x27;s commercial release was accompanied by different remixes; &quot;The Beast Within&quot; remix was condemned as anti-semitic by some Jewish organizations. &quot;Justify My Love&quot; received generally positive reviews by music critics, who appreciated Madonna and Kravitz&#x27;s collaboration as well as its sensual nature, and was retrospectively noted as one of Madonna&#x27;s best singles. The song was a commercial success, becoming Madonna&#x27;s ninth number-one single on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and also peaked at number one in Canada; it also reached the top 10 on several countries including Australia, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

The accompanying music video, shot in Paris and directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, is a tribute to the film &quot;Bay of Angels&quot; (1963). It features Madonna&#x27;s then-boyfriend Tony Ward and portrays the singer as a woman walking in a hotel hallway, looking distressed and tired from work, until being seduced into having sex with a mysterious man and woman. The video contained imagery of sadomasochism, voyeurism and bisexuality, and was subsequently banned from MTV and other networks internationally due to its sexually explicit nature. In response, the video was released as a video single on VHS and became the first-ever short-form video to be certified multiplatinum in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

&quot;Justify My Love&quot; and &quot;The Beast Within&quot; remix have been included on four of Madonna&#x27;s concert tours, the last being 2023–2024&#x27;s Celebration Tour. It was covered and sampled a number of times by artists such as Vita, Ashanti, and Jay-Z. The music video was parodied on an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and was also seen by critics as feminist, as well as considered one of the sexiest videos of all time by some publications. &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was included on Madonna&#x27;s greatest hits albums &quot;Celebration&quot; (2009) and &quot;Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones&quot; (2022).

==Background and release==
By the end of 1990, Madonna was ready to release her first greatest hits collection, titled &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;, after becoming the biggest female singles artist in history, with the most number-one and top-ten hit songs by a woman in both the United States and the United Kingdom. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of &quot;&quot;, the release was &quot;much more than a mere collection of Madonna&#x27;s biggest-selling and most popular songs&quot;. The singer regarded it as a &quot;proud landmark&quot; of her career, which had progressed upwards since she broke out in the music scene in 1983. Following the completion of 1990&#x27;s Blond Ambition World Tour, Madonna began rushing the project, aiming to release it in time for the year&#x27;s Christmas season. On October 13, 1990, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine confirmed that Madonna had been working on new material for the album with Shep Pettibone and Lenny Kravitz. The collection had 15 of Madonna&#x27;s previously released singles, and two new songs, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, were included in order to generate the public&#x27;s interest.

&quot;Justify My Love&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; on November 6, 1990. It was issued on the UK on December 1, and in Japan on December 10. The artwork for the single, photographed by Patrick Demarchelier and directed by Jeri Heiden, features a picture of Madonna aggressively leaning forward, wearing a sleeveless waistcoast with her hair scrunched up under a black cap, an aggressive expression on her face, and a cigarette hanging out of her lips. Carol Clerk, author of &quot;Madonnastyle&quot;, opined that &quot;it was a particularly masculine pose; Madonna, at times, could look as butch as the next man&quot;. The picture had previously appeared on the cover of an &quot;Interview&quot; magazine issue which featured an interview with Madonna, and later was removed from the French version of the single. Afterwards, the song was included on Madonna&#x27;s third greatest hits album &quot;Celebration&quot; (2009), and as a remixed form on &quot;Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones&quot; (2022).

==Development==

&quot;Justify My Love&quot; was written by singer and songwriter Ingrid Chavez as a love letter dedicated to Kravitz, who was having an affair with her at the time. He invited her over to a studio where he was producing tracks with André Betts, and then recorded the letter in one take. Kravitz took a master copy of the song to Virgin Records, as their relationship ended some time later. Months later, he told Chavez that Madonna would release &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and asked her to sign a document saying that she would receive 12.5% publishing royalties, but no credit. She eventually signed the paper and was then invited to meet Madonna in the studio while they mixed the track, and was impressed by how she copied her vocals exactly from the demo version; Chavez thought that &quot;maybe she just felt like she didn&#x27;t want another woman to take credit for the creative style of the vocal&quot;.

Upon the song&#x27;s release, Chavez filed a lawsuit against them, claiming the only words Kravitz wrote were &quot;justify my love&quot;, while Madonna changed one line. It was also reported that she only received a US$500 advance after Kravitz pressured her to sign an agreement surrendering credit and three-quarters of royalties. He admitted that Chavez had written part of the lyrics, but both had agreed not to credit her for personal and professional reasons, and accused her of trying to &quot;make like she did the whole thing&quot; upon the single&#x27;s success. She responded by stating that the reason was because he was afraid his wife would think they were having an affair. They eventually reached an out-of-court settlement whereby she received 12.5% percent of royalties and her name on the next pressings. However, her name does not appear on any compilations containing the song. Betts also sued Kravitz, claiming he was promised co-producer credit and half of any producer&#x27;s royalties, but received an associate producer&#x27;s credit and was not paid for his work.

Kravitz recalled that he had been working on demos, and the demo version of &quot;Justify My Love&quot; came up. At first, he thought it was &quot;super-sexy and hard at the same time. I just felt it. I just knew that there was something very special about the track and the minimum quality, because it was so minimal. Just a gut thing&quot;. However, he &quot;knew it wasn&#x27;t for me&quot;, but thought it would be perfect for Madonna, and phoned her saying he had a number-one song for her. The same day, they met in New York City, where Kravitz played the demo for her. After listening to the song multiple times, Madonna agreed on recording, and both started working on it the next day. Kravitz described the recording session as &quot;just the two of us and my engineers, and it happened in one day. It was very quick&quot;, adding it was fun and &quot;all very authentic&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Justify My Love&quot; was written by Kravitz and Chavez, with additional lyrics by Madonna; he also produced the song alongside André Betts. It was recorded by Henry Hirsch, David Domanich, Andy Cardenas, and Josh Cuervokas at Waterfront Studios in London, and Unique Recording Studios in New York City. Ted Jensen mastered the song at Sterling Sound Studios, while it was mixed by Shep Pettibone and Goh Hotoda at Guerilla Studios in London. The mixing was done in QSound, which at that time was a new audio filter to create a three-dimensional sound effect. This was employed on all of Madonna&#x27;s past hits present on &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;.

&quot;Justify My Love&quot; is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 132 beats per minute. Composed in the key of B minor, Madonna&#x27;s vocal range spans from A4 to D5. It follows the chord progression of E5–F5–E5–F5 during the opening melody. Musically, it is a hip hop, dance, trip-hop, and experimental pop song, which features spoken word vocals by Madonna and Kravitz&#x27;s &quot;moans&quot; on background vocals. It contains a drum sample of Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Security of the First World&quot; (1988) used initially without consent, and the group threatened to take legal action against both singers; however, music industry members believed the drum beat was sampled from James Brown&#x27;s single &quot;Funky Drummer&quot; (1970), but these claims were denied by the group&#x27;s producer, Hank Shocklee. A spokeswoman for Madonna said she never had heard their song and &quot;didn&#x27;t write the music&quot; for &quot;Justify My Love&quot;, while Kravitz dismissed the claims by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s just one of those beats you find on the floor somewhere.&quot;

Lyrically, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was described as a &quot;spoken-word ode to releasing your inner freak&quot;. Madonna starts singing the lines &quot;I wanna kiss you in Paris, I wanna hold your hand in Rome, I wanna run naked in a rainstorm, make love in a train... cross country&quot;. The chorus changes its atmosphere, as the singer&#x27;s breathing vocals initially punctuate the &quot;wanting, needing, waiting&quot; line, which prefaces the double-tracked &quot;for you to justify my love&quot;, with the words &quot;my love&quot; being repeated in the background. The second verse begins with her uttering &quot;OK&quot;, suggesting a move in direction, reflected by the line &quot;I wanna know you... no, not like that&quot;. On the next verse, Madonna utters the lines &quot;Talk to me, tell me your dreams / Am I in them? Tell me your fears / Are you scared? Tell me your stories&quot;, implying the position of a woman sexually in control, which is reinforced by the line &quot;Poor is the man whose pleasures depend upon the permission of another&quot;, with its underlying connotations of domination through the lyrics &quot;Love me, that&#x27;s right, love me / I wanna be your baby&quot;. Scholar Sheila Whiteley noted in her book &quot;Women and Popular Music: Sexuality, Identity, and Subjectivity&quot; that the song&#x27;s lyrics &quot;imply an overall focus on sexual fantasy&quot; with &quot;implicit S&amp;M of pleasuring allied to permission&quot;, suggesting that certain pleasures need to be justified.

Taraborrelli described the composition as &quot;rather simple – a funky, drum pattern under a droning, aural synthesizer pad, with Madonna speaking sexy verses over the music, Kravitz casually moaning a melody in the background&quot;. In a similar vein, Rikky Rooksby wrote on his book &quot;Madonna: The Complete Guide to Her Music&quot; that the elements on the song were &quot;simple enough: a drum loop that repeats for the duration of the song, a bass part, and a descending four chord sequence moving from F♯ minor to B minor&quot;, whose melody &quot;doesn&#x27;t exactly go anywhere, but it creates a hypnotic atmosfere which supports the imagery of the lyric&quot;. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, in their book &quot;Madonna&#x27;s Drowned Worlds&quot;, stated that it was &quot;far from an ordinary pop song&quot;, featuring &quot;a very simple tonal structure and the same bassline&quot;, with the same chords repeated over and over. They also noted its &quot;little melodic interest&quot;, with Madonna speaking more than she sang through her &quot;distant, remote, &#x27;elsewhere&#x27;&quot; androgynous vocals. Tom Breiham from &quot;Stereogum&quot; later classified &quot;Justify My Love&quot; as &quot;an early example of trip-hop&quot;, and pointed out that Madonna deserves credit for &quot;anticipating whole new trends before they even happened.&quot;

===&quot;The Beast Within&quot;===
&quot;Justify My Love&quot; received a remix titled &quot;The Beast Within&quot;, and was included on some versions of the single. Musically influenced by Eastern music, the remix featured only the chorus and certain lines of the original song, as most of the verses were replaced by passages from the Book of Revelation from the Bible. At the time, Madonna told &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that &quot;the beast within&quot; was Saddam Hussein and that the mix was inspired by &quot;the impending war in the Middle East&quot;. About a third of the way into the six-minute song, Madonna reads the line &quot;I know your tribulation and your poverty and the slander of those who say that they are Jews, but they are not. They are a Synagogue of Satan&quot;, which was deemed anti-semitic by some Jewish organizations. According to Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, &quot;When we saw those lyrics the alarm bell went off&quot;, as &quot;the impact of having America&#x27;s leading cultural icon say those lyrics can give a powerful tool to bigots&quot;. He also commented, &quot;Anti-Semitism is a real problem in America today and an entertainer as big of a blockbuster as Madonna should show some responsibility to such social issues.&quot; Cooper sent a letter to the singer&#x27;s management, and initially asked for the line to be removed from the song. Madonna was reportedly shocked by the controversy, calling the accusations &quot;ridiculous&quot; and stating: &quot;People can say I am an exhibitionist, but no one can ever accuse me of being a racist&quot;. She then elaborated that it was &quot;a commentary on evil in general&quot;: &quot;The song is, after all, about love.&quot; The rabbi replied that she responded quickly to the issue, and was relieved that she did so.

==Critical response==

Upon release, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was met with generally positive responses from music critics. Larry Flick of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine gave a positive review, calling it a &quot;brilliantly conceived jam&quot;, which would be &quot;devoured by club DJs&quot; and &quot;may test the devotion of top 40 radio programmers&quot;. Another review from the same magazine stated that the song was a &quot;steamy&quot; collaboration between Madonna and Kravitz, and it had &quot;the juice to become the &#x27;90s equivalent of Donna Summer&#x27;s &#x27;Love To Love You Baby&#x27;&quot;, and noted that it &quot;strays miles away from the chirpy pop of her past.&quot; Chuck Campbell from the &quot;Knoxville News-Sentinel&quot; said it was &quot;so seductive it makes George Michael&#x27;s &#x27;I Want Your Sex&#x27; and Donna Summer&#x27;s &#x27;I Feel Love&#x27; sound like nursery rhymes&quot;. &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; staff commented that the &quot;unlikely&quot; collaboration of Madonna and Kravitz was a &quot;marriage made in heaven&quot;, as well as &quot;atmospheric, yet brutal in an unconventional manner&quot;. On her of the singer, author Lucy O&#x27;Brien stated that the track &quot;opened up a new creative avenue for Madonna, as she moved into more &#x27;adult&#x27; territory&quot;. Similarly, Rooksby wrote that &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was a pivotal record for the singer, pointing her musical direction into the 1990s decade, giving her old disco sound &quot;the kiss of death&quot;. &quot;Select&quot;″s Andrew Harrison considered the song &quot;breathy, pulsing and overpoweringly sexy&quot;, which, along with &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, played on Madonna&#x27;s &quot;ambiguous vulnerability, the disqueting mix of sexual predation and submission that gives Madonna&#x27;s records an edge where Paula Abdul&#x27;s just have a verse and chorus&quot;. Taraborrelli commented that the track &quot;oozed pungent sex, it was just that passionate&quot;, while J.D. Considine of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; noted its &quot;simmering passion&quot;.

In an album guide for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was described along with &quot;Rescue Me&quot; as &quot;worthy sensual newies&quot; on &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;. Matthew Rettenmund, author of &quot;Encyclopedia Madonnica&quot;, opined that the track &quot;foreshadowed Madonna&#x27;s long-term commitment to explicitly politi-sexual art in the wake of an already suggestive career&quot;, and that &quot;it sounded like nothing else on the airwaves at the time&quot;. He also opined that along with &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, it was disappointing that the tracks were &quot;originated on a best-of&quot; album. Danny Eccleston from &quot;Q&quot; opined that &quot;Justify My Love&quot; had a &quot;hard-faced sexiness&quot;, while &quot;Music Week&quot; staff called it a &quot;mumbling sexy judderer&quot;. For Tony Power of &quot;Blender&quot;, the song was &quot;preposterously sexy&quot;, and he picked it as one of the standout tracks on &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;. Fouz-Hernández and Jarman-Ivens wrote that Madonna&#x27;s style of singing on the track seemed controlled and distant, and added that &quot;the background moaning, which is intended to remind the listener of copulation, is a key memorable feature&quot;. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Jim Farber described the song as &quot;some vague, tuneless phrases chanted in Madonna&#x27;s most breathless voice over a minimal house groove-serves mainly to justify the visuals&quot;; while reviewing &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;, David Browne from the same magazine called it &quot;instantly notorious&quot; but noted that along with &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, it did not &quot;[break] new ground for her&quot;. In 1992, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; won a ASCAP Pop Music Award for &quot;Most Performed Song&quot;.

Retrospective reviews have been positive. While analyzing &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;, Drew Mackie of &quot;People&quot; consisidered the song a &quot;sexy, daring track that&#x27;s not quite like anything Madonna had released before&quot;. Katharine Birbalsingh from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; opined that it was an &quot;insistent, sexy trance track&quot;. &quot;PopCrush&quot;″s Alexandra Capotorto commented that &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was &quot;perfectly constructed lovemaking music&quot;, which &quot;might be oozing sex&quot;. James Rose of Daily Review noted that with the song Madonna began &quot;a phase of her career that oscillates between cynical self-exploitation and courageous self-expression. Raunchy videos, explicitly themed lyrics and boudoir beats became &quot;de rigueur&quot; for the lady now arguably bearing the biggest name in popular music.&quot; In a review for &quot;Celebration&quot;, Eric Henderson of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; called the track &quot;aromatic&quot; and &quot;considered by most fans to be among the singer&#x27;s best work&quot;. According to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Eric Diaz, it remained &quot;one of Madonna&#x27;s sexiest bangers, setting the stage not only for her still-underrated &quot;Erotica&quot; era but her tireless capacity to transform and provoke&quot;. Justin Myers from Official Charts Company considered the track &quot;filthy for the time but pretty tame now&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was classified her 12th best on Madonna&#x27;s top 20 singles of all-time list by &quot;Q&quot; magazine, as well as placed at number 842 in the list of the &quot;1001 Best Songs Ever&quot; by the same publication.

==Chart performance==

In the US, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; debuted at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, on the issue dated November 17, 1990.

==Music video==

===Development===

The music video for &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was filmed within three days in November 1990 at the Royal Monceau Hotel in Paris, France. It was directed by Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who had previously directed the video for Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; (1987). The clip was produced by Philippe Dupuis-Mendel under Bandits, in a co-production with Propaganda Films, with editing by Oliver Gajan and principal photography by Pascal Lebegue. The video features Madonna&#x27;s then-boyfriend Tony Ward, fellow models Amanda Cazalet and Wallis Franken Montana, as well as Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza, who was a dancer on the Blond Ambition World Tour which occurred earlier that year. It is a tribute to the film &quot;Bay of Angels&quot; (1963). Mondino described the concept of the music video:

I&#x27;ve worked with Madonna a few times now, and there&#x27;s more to her than people think. She&#x27;s a great actress. So I wanted to do something less glamorous, less slick, more real. I wanted to put the paparazzi out of work. How can a picture of Madonna and Tony together be surprising when you&#x27;ve already seen them together half-naked in a video? [..] It was very cheap, very easy. It&#x27;s very real — that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so shocking about it. And maybe her kissing a woman... but that&#x27;s part of our society. And with AIDS, shouldn&#x27;t we celebrate kissing as a beautiful thing?

Mondino did an experience for the video, locking the entire crew into a hotel for three days and two nights, setting no rules, and nobody was allowed to go out. The entire top floor with 15 rooms was rented, and also served as makeup and wardrobe rooms; they had no deadline, as opposed to a regular video. He explained that he did not have any concept, except for the idea that Madonna arrived in the hotel tired and broken, and left full of energy. The director recalled that by the end of it, he was unable to differentiate the real from the performed as they were not following a script. He described the shooting as &quot;very quiet, it was very gentle, we were all very sweet to each other&quot;, and said &quot;we were talking, chatting, laughing, playing the music, shooting and when people were tired they went to bed&quot;. Mondino commented that the last day when he was supposed to go home, he felt strange, and wondered if he had to go back home or not, as he thought it was a dream rather than a video shooting. In 2013, during a Q&amp;A session with Reddit users, Madonna revealed it was her favorite music video to make.

===Synopsis===

The video was filmed in grainy black and white. It opens with a dancer in a black bodysuit dancing to the camera, cutting to Madonna walking down a hotel hallway, looking tired. She is dressed in an overcoat, carrying a suitcase, with her hand on her forehead. The ajar doors in the hallway also reveal glimpses of a topless androgynous figure, as well as a shirtless man who appears to be receiving oral sex. As Madonna starts lip synching the song, she drops the suitcase and kneels down against the wall, while caressing her neck. She opens her coat, which reveals she is wearing lace underwear, garter belt, and stockings. An out-of-focus male figure, played by Ward, emerges, and slowly walks towards her. As Madonna stands, she pulls Ward towards her and they kiss.

More images from the doors are also shown, displaying a man in black leather clothes lacing a woman into a corset, as well as a woman wearing a corset who turns to camera thrusting her breasts forward. The video moves into a scene where Madonna is seen in a bedroom, slowly removing her clothes and displaying herself on a white bed as Ward observes her. He comes close to her, undressing himself and preparing to mount her, and she pushes him away. A cut occurs, and Madonna is seen laying down with an androgynous woman, wearing male clothes and make up applied on her eyes. They engage in a kiss as Ward observes as a voyeur. Two transgender women are then seen caressing each other&#x27;s faces, while observing themselves in a mirror. The video returns to the bedroom scene, where Ward is on top of Madonna and appears to be penetrating her.

A dominatrix enters the bedroom in a cop hat and leather gloves, as well as suspenders covering her nipples. She then grabs Ward by the hair, who is tied up on a chair, wearing a latticed leather harness and leather chaps. Madonna and Ward are back in bed, caressing each other; he is then seen rubbing his face on Madonna&#x27;s body until it reaches her feet. Women in drag draw thin mustaches on each other and look into the camera, as Madonna laughs in the background, putting her hand onto her mouth. A man holds a woman&#x27;s face as she makes a fearful look to the camera. Two men are seen sitting on a couch caressing each other, while a crossdresser is laying down on their laps. Madonna leaves the hotel hurriedly, holding her suitcase, with Ward reaching out for her to return. She throws her head back as she laughs, with mouth open wide, then bites one of her fingers in disbelief. The video fades to black, and the words &quot;poor is the man whose pleasures depend on the permission of another&quot; appear on the screen.

===Release and banning===
The video was set to premiere on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Madonnathon&quot; weekend event, of which it was going to be the main attraction. However, the network suddenly announced that it could not be broadcast; on November 29, 1990, MTV&#x27;s correspondent Kurt Loder explained the reasons: &quot;When MTV programming executives got their first look at the video&#x27;s steamy bed scenes, gay and lesbian snuggling, S&amp;M and briefly bared female breasts, they decided they couldn&#x27;t air it.&quot; The channel&#x27;s executives also said in a statement, &quot;We love Madonna; we&#x27;ve had and will continue to have a terrific relationship with her. We respect her work as an artist and think she makes great videos. In its current form, this one is just not for us&quot;. It was rejected by its standards committee, which previews all new videos, and requests artists to edit or trim objectionable scenes. According to MTV&#x27;s vice-president Abbey Konowitch, the network frequently had concerns about the content of the singer&#x27;s videos, stating, &quot;You take the black lingerie, sex scenes and flesh out of &#x27;Justify My Love,&#x27; and you&#x27;ve got 10 seconds of ill-focused dancing.&quot; The channel had previously threatened to ban Madonna&#x27;s music videos from airing — such as &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, &quot;Oh Father&quot; (1989), and &quot;Vogue&quot; (1990) — but ultimately broadcast all videos unedited. When &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was submitted, Madonna thought she was &quot;once again going to be able to bend the rules a little bit&quot; after &quot;Vogue&quot; was broadcast; however, MTV simply refused to air it, refusing to even edit the video. The singer stated that &quot;we didn&#x27;t even really get a chance to try to make it viewable. They rejected it completely.&quot; The channel responded by saying, &quot;This decision went all the way to the top. There is no way we could even edit this. I can&#x27;t believe Madonna ever thought we would air it&quot;. This sparked suggestions by music industry insiders that the video was designed to be banned, as part of a marketing strategy.

The video was premiered in its entirety on The Jukebox Network, an interactive cable network, on November 29, 1990; it was later aired on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;, on December 3. The channel&#x27;s lawyers analyzed the video before it was shown, and agreed to its broadcast &quot;because of the news value of the video, the late air time, and the focus of the discussion&quot;. Madonna was also interviewed by the show&#x27;s host Forrest Sawyer about the video&#x27;s sexual content and censorship. She defended the video as a &quot;celebration of sex&quot; and wondered, &quot;Why is it that people are willing to go and watch a movie about someone getting blown to bits for no reason at all, and nobody wants to see two girls kissing and two men snuggling?&quot; The singer also expressed during the interview that she did not understand why MTV banned the video yet allowed videos that contained violence and degradation to women to continue receiving regular airplay, saying, &quot;I draw the line at violence and humiliation and degradation.&quot; Her appearance on &quot;Nightline&quot; became the show&#x27;s highest-rated episode for the entire year. Other shows which showed parts of the video also garnered record-breaking ratings, such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) and CNN&#x27;s &quot;Showbiz Today&quot;.

The music video was also banned from regular rotation on MuchMusic and Musique Plus in Canada. John Martin, program director for the former, said it was inappropriate to air, while the latter&#x27;s program director Pierre Marchand called the video a &quot;soft-porn short movie with a message about freedom of choice&quot;, and stated that viewers needed to understand before accepting it. The banning led MuchMusic to air a special titled &quot;A Question of Taste&quot;, where the video was aired in its entirety, accompanied by panel discussions on its artistic and cultural context. In the UK, the video premiered on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Word&quot;, and later the Independent Broadcasting Authority determined its airing only after the 9pm watershed. Although many complaints were received, the clip was played without restriction on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s music video show &quot;Rage&quot;, as the channel is not bound to follow classification guidelines due to being a public broadcaster. In 2002, the video was aired in its entirety on MTV2 as part of a special countdown showing the most controversial videos ever to air on MTV.

Upon the video&#x27;s banning, Madonna decided make it available commercially as a video single, marking the first time an artist had released a single in this format in the United States; it was described as an unprecedented move in the video industry. When asked whether she stood to make money selling the video than airing it on MTV, she answered, &quot;Yeah, so lucky me.&quot; The video single was released on December 7, 1990, in the US, with the retail price of $9.98. The European version also contained Madonna&#x27;s performance of &quot;Vogue&quot; at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards. The release peaked at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Music Videos for two weeks, and spent 39 weeks on the chart overall. It has been certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of 200,000 units in the US, and went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, becoming the best selling video single of all time. In the United Kingdom, the video was given an 18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), meaning no one under that age could legally buy or see the release. It was reported that in Saudi Arabia it was sold at a high price as illegal market porn. The music video was included on the greatest hits package &quot;&quot; (2009); the version included was censored with black bars in a scene that contains female nudity.

===Reception and analysis===

Caryn James from &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; considered Madonna&#x27;s music videos for &quot;Express Yourself&quot; and &quot;Papa Don&#x27;t Preach&quot; (1986) more controversial, but deemed &quot;Justify My Love&quot; as her most pretentious, stating: &quot;The feminist message of Justify My Love is that Madonna can control a career as shrewdly as any man.&quot; Camille Paglia, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called Madonna &quot;a true feminist&quot; and deemed the video &quot;truly avant-garde, at a time when that word has lost its meaning in the flabby art world&quot;. Nevertheless, she stated that MTV was right to ban it, as &quot;parents cannot possibly control television, with its titanic omnipresence&quot; and that &quot;it does not belong on a mainstream music channel watched around the clock by children&quot;. On the other hand, Liz Smith, writing for the &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot;, was critical of the decision, and hoped that since &quot;MTV has gone so moral on the public, that they&#x27;ll also begin to take close looks at other material submitted to them by all those macho metal and rap groups, with their own S&amp;M overtones, their incipient violence and degradation-of-women themes&quot;. She also noted that who admired the singer would applaud her refusal to censor her art, and who never liked her would dislike her more than ever. Richard Goldstein from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; opined that &quot;by suppressing erotic dissent, MTV does its best to see that this powerful medium will not communicate the &#x27;wrong&#x27; idea about sex. That may pacify the puritans, but it also makes it easier to deny women and gays their full humanity—easier for the metal masses to justify their hate&quot;, concluding that &quot;&#x27;Justify My Love&#x27; makes it harder to hurt people&quot;. Johns Hopkins University professor of popular culture Mark Crispin Miller observed that it was &quot;perfectly all right for MTV to broadcast sadomasochism couplings and events as long as the images don&#x27;t violate a certain heterosexual norm&quot;. Considine agreed, stating that there was &quot;very little&quot; in the clip that had not been seen on MTV, pointing out music videos by R.E.M., Boy George and Aerosmith as examples.

Benjamin Svetkey from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; pointed out that &quot;MTV has banned videos before, but this time the network was saying no to the world’s most powerful recording artist. Madonna&#x27;s sex-charged career has been carved out of controversy, and now, for the first time, the hippest cultural outlet on television was telling her to cool it.&quot; Sharing a similar opinion, Lisa Henderson, writing in the book &quot;The Madonna Connection: Representational Politics, Subcultural Identities, And Cultural Theory&quot;, stated that for critics and fans, &quot;it was an odd scenario—MTV rejecting its premier pop star, whose stylistic developments had arguably marked (and marketed) the evolution of music television itself&quot;. Considine wrote in the book &quot;The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary&quot; that the banning &quot;immediately mushroomed into a censorship scandal&quot;, as &quot;Madonna insisted that she hadn&#x27;t caused the commotion intentionally&quot;, but &quot;her critics accused her of planning the whole thing. Nobody doubted her intelligence then—they merely held it against her.&quot; In &quot;Justify My Love: Sex, Subversion, and Music Video&quot;, Ryann Donnelly wrote that &quot;while the banning of Madonna&#x27;s Justify My Love video for its explicit sexual content has become somewhat legendary — a sufficient promotional tool in itself — few artists could have sacrificed the support of MTV in a similar way to that of Madonna, before YouTube&quot;. Commenting on the video&#x27;s release as a video single, Landon Palmer stated in &quot;Rock Star/Movie Star: Power and Performance in Cinematic Rock Stardom&quot; that &quot;the release of &#x27;Justify My Love&#x27; exclusively on VHS had the effect of creating a new moving image platform – the &#x27;video single&#x27; – for Madonna&#x27;s cultural production, extending the narrowcast relationship between artist and audience popularized by MTV&quot;.

The video&#x27;s bisexual and sadomasochist themes were also noted. In another article, Paglia recalled that &quot;in a number of videos, Madonna has played with bisexual innuendos&quot;, and &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was a culmination of that; she considered Madonna as a pioneer for &quot;restoring lesbian eroticism to the continuum of heterosexual response&quot; in the clip, showing &quot;bisexuality and all experimentation as a liberation from false, narrow categories&quot;. Lucy O&#x27;Brien, in her book &quot;She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul&quot;, wrote that &quot;conveying the full power of sexual ambiguity&quot;, Madonna showed in the video &quot;how gender roles could be swapped, blurred and played with to create a multitude of different identities&quot;. According to Janelle L. Wilson and Gerald E. Markle, the eroticism shown in the video was &quot;by traditional standards, non-normative. The effeminate dancer, the homosexual behavior and the action and appearance of the masculine woman in the video also represent behavior outside the accepted norms.&quot; For Cathy Schwichtenberg, Madonna&#x27;s &quot;languid French kiss with &quot;l&#x27;autre femme&quot;&quot; in the video was a representation of &quot;a deconstruction of lines and boundaries that fragment male/female gender polarities and pluralize sexual practices. This is a postmodern, unbounded feminism, that unifies coalitionally rather than foundationally.&quot; According to Tim Dean in the book &quot;Beyond Sexuality&quot;, the music video was &quot;replete with stylized gestures of representing the whole catalogue of perverse activity: lesbianism, fetishism, voyeurism, transvestism, troilism, and the ritual accoutrements of sadomasochism&quot;.

Reflecting on the video for &quot;Justify My Love&quot; in a retrospective review, Tom Breiham from &quot;Stereogum&quot; pointed out that the video became &quot;one more time that Madonna made the entire media industrial complex serve her interests&quot;. Daniel Browne, writing for &quot;The Gay UK&quot; website, cited five reasons for calling the video a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, such as sex, gender bending, and gay and lesbian romping, describing it as &quot;five minutes of artistic brilliance. I cannot think of a video before or since that covers such a topic in a positive and empowering way. The act of sex in its various forms, cross-dressing and fluid sexuality tend to kept behind closed doors.&quot; In a similar vein, &quot;Dig!&quot;″s Mark Elliott went on to say that &quot;the gender fluidity and nudity featured in the new video were provocative enough in a more sheltered era, but the fact it was being issued by such a major star was extraordinary&quot;, citing George Michael&#x27;s &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot; (1987) as an example of a video that had explored similar thematic territory, but was altogether more conventional in its approach. Samantha Grossman from &quot;Time&quot; observed that &quot;if YouTube had existed when &#x27;Justify My Love&#x27; was released in 1990, the extremely NSFW music video would have gone viral in minutes, if not seconds&quot;. In 2015, Christopher Rosa of VH1 showed the music video to five people around the age of twenty, later interviewing them on their thoughts after watching it. All five of them agreed that it was &quot;certainly envelope-pushing&quot;, but also pointed out that &quot;it&#x27;s nothing 2015 artists haven&#x27;t done (or even surpassed)&quot;, with the author citing the film &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; and Nicki Minaj&#x27;s music video for &quot;Anaconda&quot; (2014) as examples. Additionally, it was later added to sexiest music videos of all time lists by VH1, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Marie Claire&quot;.

==Live performances==
Madonna performed &quot;Justify My Love&quot; for the first time on the Girlie Show tour in 1993 during the concert&#x27;s encore. For the performance, the singer and her dancers wore period costumes, mocking specifically Victorian fashion, while she held a lorgnette. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot;″ Jim Farber commented that Madonna and the dancers &quot;cavorted elegantly&quot; throughout the number, reversing expectations that the performance would be raunchy. Richard Corliss from &quot;Time&quot; magazine complimented the performance, opining that the singer saved &quot;her best anachronistic joke for last&quot;, noting its &quot;stately cadence&quot; and comparing the costumes to those of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. &quot;The Beast Within&quot; remix was also used on the tour as an interlude with two male dancers performing an apocalyptic dance, miming couplings and brawls while Madonna, from off-stage, recited the lyrics. Jon Pareles from &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered the performance an &quot;ambiguous sequence, mourning the sexual freedom of the pre-AIDS 1970&#x27;s, then hinting at biblical retribution&quot;. These two performances on the November 19, 1993 show at Sydney Cricket Ground was recorded and released on VHS and LaserDisc on April 26, 1994, as &quot;The Girlie Show: Live Down Under&quot;.

&quot;The Beast Within&quot; remix was again used as the video introduction to 2004&#x27;s Re-Invention World Tour; the visual showed footage of &quot;X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS&quot;, a collaboration between Madonna and Steven Klein. &quot;Chart Attack&quot; magazine staff noted its &quot;quasi-religious mumbo-jumbo&quot; paired with &quot;some genuinely arty images of the singer&quot; on the screens, while Sal Cinquemani from &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; found the introduction &quot;macabre&quot;. It was subsequently included on the 2006 documentary and live album &quot;I&#x27;m Going to Tell You a Secret&quot;.

&quot;Justify My Love&quot; was later used as a video interlude during the MDNA Tour in 2012. The performance featured dancers wearing white pierrot masks, who &quot;impressed with their fully synchronized dance moves&quot;, according to Danilo Saraiva from &quot;Quem&quot; magazine. The video, directed by Tom Munro, featured a lingerie-clad Madonna. The number was included in the live album &quot;MDNA World Tour&quot;, released on September 6, 2013. Elements of the song were also used during the &quot;S.E.X.&quot; interlude on the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015–16, as dancers writhed on &quot;gravity-defying&quot; beds. The performance of the song at the March 19–20, 2016 shows in Sydney&#x27;s Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna&#x27;s fifth live album, &quot;Rebel Heart Tour&quot;. The song&#x27;s performance on the Celebration Tour (2023–2024) featured &quot;Busby Berkeley-esque choreography&quot;, and saw the singer —dressed in lingerie and bondage gear— cavorting in a bed with a female dancer wearing a gimp mask and simulating masturbation, in a sequence that referred the Blond Ambition World Tour. &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was named one of the best moments of the concert by &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Joe Lynch. &quot;The Beast Within&quot; was also used as a video interlude on Celebration. The BBC&#x27;s Mark Savage criticized the inclusion: &quot;Did we really need [...] the obscure &quot;Beast Within&quot; remix [...] when songs like &#x27;Express Yourself&#x27; and &#x27;Frozen&#x27; were discarded as snippets?&quot;.

==Usage in media, covers and samples==

On May 11, 1991, Madonna made a guest appearance on &quot;SNL&quot; on the recurring sketch &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;; it spoofed the song&#x27;s music video as well as her documentary &quot;&quot;. The spoof consisted of Wayne (Mike Myers) and Garth (Dana Carvey) encountering a seductive Madonna lying on a bed in a hotel room during a fantasy dream sequence, filmed in black and white. After some back-and-forth banter, Wayne and Madonna play truth or dare. Wayne begins by saying &quot;truth&quot;. Madonna then asks &quot;Have you ever made love with two women at the same time?&quot; He answers &quot;Uh... yes!&quot; to which Madonna says, &quot;Okay, I believe you... Not!&quot; Wayne then dares Madonna to make out with him. As they kiss, the music for &quot;Justify My Love&quot; begins playing. The scene ends as two dominatrixes appear in the room, accompanied by a Prince lookalike.

In 1999, a cover of the song, done by Front Line Assembly with vocals by Kristy Thirsk, was included on the compilation album &quot;Virgin Voices: A Tribute To Madonna, Vol. 1&quot;. The next year, it received cover versions included on the tribute albums &quot;Truly Blue: Tribute to Madonna&quot; and &quot;A Tribute to Madonna: Tranceformed&quot;. &quot;Justify My Love&quot; was also covered by rapper Vita, featuring singer Ashanti, for &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; soundtrack in 2001, while the same year another cover version by Starsound Orchestra was included on the tribute album &quot;Plays the Hits Made Famous by Madonna&quot;. In 2012, Brazilian singer Gretchen recorded a cover with a music video using footage of her own acting career. In 2020, Chavez released her own version of &quot;Justify My Love&quot; on streaming platforms. Two years later, she released a limited edition cassette with eight remixes.

German band Enigma sampled one of the remixes of the song for their &quot;Orthodox Remix&quot; of the 1991 single, &quot;Mea Culpa (Part II)&quot;. In 1994, Eurodance act Maxx sampled its beat in the song &quot;Suddenly&quot;, included on their debut studio album &quot;To the Maxximum&quot;. German electronic duo Jam &amp; Spoon sampled a part of the song&#x27;s remixes for a remix of &quot;Kaleidoscope Skies&quot; (1997), featuring Plavka. Rapper Mase used a sample from &quot;Justify My Love&quot; on his song &quot;Stay Out of My Way&quot;, included on his second studio album, &quot;Double Up&quot; (1999). In 2003, rapper Jay-Z also sampled the song on &quot;Justify My Thug&quot;, on his eighth studio album, &quot;The Black Album&quot;, described as a &quot;hip hop re-working&quot; of the original song. Portions of &quot;Justify My Love&quot; were used by Insane Clown Posse in their 2004 single &quot;Bowling Balls&quot;.

<text>Arvin Sloane is a fictional character played by Ron Rifkin. He was the former director of SD-6 on the television series, &quot;Alias&quot;. 
&quot;TV Guide&quot; included him in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.

==Biography==

Arvin Sloane is the cold, calculating leader of SD-6, directing its operations against the U.S. government under the guise of being a secret organization within the government itself. He is eventually promoted to being a full member of &quot;The Alliance&quot;, the organization that operates above each individual SD cell.

It is revealed through the course of the series that Sloane speaks Spanish, French, Japanese, Nepali, Mandarin, and Russian and reads Homeric Greek. It was revealed in the third season that Sloane has a life-threatening allergy to morphine.

Sloane is married to his long-time wife, Emily, for over 30 years. Early in his marriage Sloane was with the CIA, attached to the US Army Corps of Engineers, which is where he first encountered the works of Milo Rambaldi. Initially, Sloane dismissed Rambaldi and his works. That would change following the death of Arvin and Emily&#x27;s infant daughter, Jacqueline. Wracked with grief, Sloane stumbled across some Rambaldi pages that he had stuck in a desk drawer and forgotten about. Reviewing the pages, Sloane was gripped by the possibilities inherent in what he saw there. This interest would rapidly grow into an obsession with all things Rambaldi.

At some point, Sloane had a brief affair with Jack Bristow&#x27;s wife, Irina Derevko (alias Laura). This resulted in the birth of the child who would become known as Nadia Santos. It is unclear exactly when this affair took place or exactly when Nadia was born. Sydney Bristow was born in 1975. It&#x27;s stated in the series that Michael Vaughn&#x27;s father kidnapped Nadia for her own safety when she was a young girl, and he was killed by Irina in 1979. It&#x27;s also stated that Irina gave birth to Nadia in a Russian prison after she left Jack. Sydney is age 6 when Irina fakes her death in late 1981, which means that Nadia must have been born in 1982. The timelines cannot be reconciled. Regardless of the exact timeline, Jack did not learn of this affair for over two decades. After Irina&#x27;s apparent death, Jack was taken into federal custody and Sloane and Emily became Sydney&#x27;s temporary guardians. Sydney believes that she didn&#x27;t meet Sloane until she was recruited, as she reveals in season 2 episode &quot;Cipher&quot; that she has &quot;big gaps in [her] memory&quot; around the time of the death of her mother.

Some time after that, Sloane and a number of other CIA agents broke from the agency to attach themselves to the Alliance of Twelve. Sloane eventually became head of that section of the Alliance known as SD-6. When Sydney was 19 and a freshman in college, Sloane recruited her to join SD-6, convincing her that she was joining the CIA.

==Storyline==
===Season 1===
Partway through season 1, it is revealed that Emily was suffering from apparent terminal cancer. Emily learned that her husband had never truly left the world of intelligence. She made the mistake of telling Sydney what she knew and SD-6 soon caught wind of this fact. As a condition of Sloane&#x27;s being promoted to a full member of the Alliance he was ordered to kill his wife. Unable to bring himself to do this, Sloane set up an elaborate ruse, including the amputation of Emily&#x27;s finger, to convince the Alliance that she was dead.

===Season 2===
Concurrent with his engineering the downfall of The Alliance and SD-6, Sloane went underground, allying with Julian Sark and continuing his obsessive pursuit of Rambaldi artifacts. Emily collaborated secretly with the CIA to expose her husband&#x27;s new crimes and consented to helping them capture Sloane by wearing a hidden wire but was coaxed by Sloane, during this operation, swaying Emily from her cooperation with the CIA, thus allowing them to foil the CIA&#x27;s original task. They attempted to flee together, with cover fire from Julian Sark and the help of Sydney&#x27;s mother, Irina Derevko, (who was stealing a Rambaldi book) to Sloan&#x27;s awaiting helicopter, but Emily was accidentally shot in the shoulder by the bullet meant for her husband and killed by Marcus Dixon, a former SD-6 agent now with the CIA. In retaliation, Sloane later arranged for Dixon&#x27;s death by having a bomb placed in his vehicle one night while he and his wife, Diane, were having dinner with Sydney &amp; Vaughn. Dixon &amp; Diane were supposed to be in the same vehicle but ended up driving separate vehicles that night. His wife, who had already gotten into her SUV and was driving away, was killed in the car bomb explosion. At the last minute, Dixon had turned around and was coming back to tell Sydney something, sparing him from seeing the actual explosion.

===Season 3===
Between seasons 2 and 3 (the two-year gap where Sydney went missing), Sloane turned himself in to the U.S. government and, in exchange for a full pardon, utilized all of his knowledge to help bring down various terrorist organizations. Sloane then moved to Zürich, Switzerland, setting up a humanitarian organization called Omnifam and apparently becoming a philanthropist, claiming that his research into Rambaldi&#x27;s secrets led him to one word: peace. Sloane still occasionally worked for the CIA by utilizing his contacts with the Covenant and other organizations, but his motives still elicited suspicion within the government, and particularly from Sydney, who never forgave him for authorizing the murder of her fiancé during the SD-6 days.

In fact, besides the word &quot;peace&quot;, the Rambaldi device known as &quot;Il Dire&quot; (The Telling) printed out the DNA pattern for a person Rambaldi called The Passenger. Sloane determined that The Passenger was his daughter with Irina Derevko, a woman named Nadia Santos who was an agent with Argentine intelligence. Sloane abducts her and injects her with a green &quot;Rambaldi fluid&quot; which makes her a &quot;living conduit to Rambaldi&quot;. Nadia generates a complex algebraic equation that translates into a longitude and latitude for another Rambaldi artifact, The Sphere of Life. Sloane and Nadia briefly teamed up to recover the Sphere, but Nadia left her father when it appeared his Rambaldi obsession had become madness; she returned to Argentina.

===Season 4===
Sloane is subsequently pardoned again and is recruited by the CIA to head up a new black ops division patterned after SD-6, called Authorized Personnel Only (APO). Sloane&#x27;s first task was to hand-pick the agents he wanted to serve in the APO, choosing Sydney, Jack, Dixon and Vaughn. He later successfully convinced Nadia to join and added Marshall Flinkman and Eric Weiss.

Sloane&#x27;s biggest challenge as the head of APO was in convincing Sydney, Vaughn, and Marcus that his intentions are genuine. Under orders by CIA superiors to keep close tabs on Sloane, the three agents have on several occasions sparked false alarms as to Sloane&#x27;s loyalty. Meanwhile, Sloane and Jack have been following an agenda of their own, that appears to be related to the surviving sisters of Irina Derevko.

Late in season four it was revealed there was another man, dubbed &quot;Arvin Clone&quot; and virtually identical to Arvin Sloane in every way, was still tracking down Rambaldi artifacts in Sloane&#x27;s name and committing numerous criminal acts in the process. &quot;Arvin Clone&quot; (real name Ned Bolger) is blamed for Irina&#x27;s death by setting her up to appear as if she had contracted an assassin to kill Sydney. It is eventually explained that Bolger was chosen because his brainwaves were similar to Sloane&#x27;s, allowing him to be part of a complex program to &#x27;clone&#x27; Sloane&#x27;s own brain patterns on to Bolger, allowing him to be grafted with a copy of Sloane&#x27;s memories to help his superiors find Rambaldi artefacts by drawing on Sloane&#x27;s expertise.

Toward the conclusion of the fourth season, Sloane confesses that through his work with Omnifam, he has seeded water supplies around the world with chemical contaminants designed to make humanity more peaceful. He abandons his post as APO director, apparently to join Elena Derevko&#x27;s scheme to destroy civilization using the contaminated water in conjunction with the Mueller device. In reality, Sloane is infiltrating Elena&#x27;s organization in order to stop her endgame but Dixon is seriously wounded when trying to stop Sloane. During the final mission to stop Elena, Sloane aids APO, but in doing so is forced to shoot Nadia (who has been transformed by the chemical contaminants into a killing machine and is strangling Sydney). As the season ends, Sloane is imprisoned by the CIA, but receives an unexpected visit from Sydney, who tells him she believes his motives were good as she arranges for him to visit with his daughter.

===Season 5===
During the fifth season, Sloane finds himself at the mercy of turncoat CIA agent Gordon Dean, who runs an SD-6-like criminal organization called &quot;The Shed&quot; on behalf of a larger group called Prophet Five. Dean arranges for Sloane to be released from federal custody, opening the door for Sloane to be reinstated with APO (albeit at a lower rank), which will allow Sloane to search for a cure for Nadia&#x27;s condition. Dean threatens to undo all this if Sloane doesn&#x27;t agree to act as a mole within APO.

This arrangement is short-lived as Sloane ultimately refuses to jeopardize the safety of Sydney or the others any longer, and he betrays Dean. Dean is captured by APO, but Sloane soon finds himself becoming beholden to another (as yet unexplained) element of Prophet Five, who holds the key to curing Nadia. This is proven when Nadia briefly regains consciousness. Under the promise of a more permanent cure, Sloane is ordered to kill Dean, which he does. Once again, Sloane is forced to act as a mole within APO on behalf of Prophet Five, with a vague promise of a cure for Nadia. When he attempts to use his new contact to locate Sydney after she is kidnapped, he is asked to make a choice between saving Sydney and saving Nadia.

Ultimately, Sloane continues to work with Prophet Five until they provide him with a cure for Nadia&#x27;s condition. He administers it, and she is successfully cured. Sloane&#x27;s relationship with Nadia was always hindered by his obsession with Rambaldi&#x27;s work (frequently at the expense of her well-being). This tension between his love for Nadia and his fixation upon Rambaldi comes to a head when Nadia demands that he choose between her and Page 47. The severity of his dichotomy was evident as he tearfully begs Nadia, &quot;Please, don&#x27;t make me choose between the two most important things in my life.&quot; When Nadia casts Page 47 into the fireplace, Sloane&#x27;s obsession takes hold and he throws her out of the way to save it, accidentally killing her when she falls through a glass table.

Following Nadia&#x27;s death, Sloane realizes that his faith in Rambaldi was all he ever truly had, making the betrayal of his loved ones inevitable. Nadia&#x27;s death, according to this interpretation, was a necessary sacrifice. Sloane then leaves APO to join Prophet Five and see Rambaldi&#x27;s work to its conclusion. Sloane subsequently is haunted by an apparition of Nadia, who states she is only appearing because Sloane wants her to be there.

Sloane realized that once his expertise with Rambaldi was no longer necessary to Prophet Five, he would be &#x27;removed&#x27; from their services permanently. To this end he convinced Julian Sark and Kelly Peyton to betray Prophet Five and ally with him, having Peyton execute all leaders of Prophet Five and having Sark eliminate APO with high explosives (killing Thomas Grace).

Sloane finally set about achieving his endgame, kidnapping Marshall Flinkman and Rachel Gibson to force them to hack into a satellite network to locate a cavern where he could utilize another Rambaldi artifact, an amulet, to uncover further details towards the fruition of his ultimate goal.

Finally, Sloane&#x27;s endgame was achieved in Mongolia, in the Tomb of Rambaldi, where Sloane used The Horizon to create a strange hovering sphere from which a reddish liquid drained. However, before the purpose of this sphere could be revealed, Sydney intervened, removing The Horizon from its setting and causing the sphere to dissipate. A stand-off ensued and Sloane shot Jack to distract Sydney long enough for Sark to recover The Horizon from her. However, Sloane himself was shot and killed in retaliation by Sydney, one bullet entering his head to confirm a kill.

As Sloane&#x27;s body collapsed, he fell into a vat of the strange liquid created by The Horizon which imbued with him special gifts, apparently the ultimate revelation of Rambaldi, immortality. Sloane recovered from his bullet wounds and was revived fully intact but was confronted by a dying Jack Bristow. Sloane offered his old friend the chance to be saved in the same rejuvenating liquid but Jack refused. Instead, Jack trapped Sloane in the tomb forever by detonating a powerful explosive and sacrificing himself.

Sloane is currently trapped under large rocks in the tomb, several hundred feet underground and alone but he is alive and seemingly immortal. The Nadia apparition makes one final appearance before vanishing. It is implied that his fate is to spend eternity trapped in this place.

==Jacquelyn Sloane==
Thirty years before season 4, Emily Sloane was pregnant with her and Arvin&#x27;s daughter. They had considered other names, but eventually stuck with Jacquelyn. It is suggested that the baby died during birth. According to Arvin, it was a risky pregnancy and the baby had fought hard to stay with them, but in the end it was overwhelming and her heart was not strong enough.

<text>This Is Hardcore is the sixth studio album by English rock band Pulp, released on 30 March 1998. Following the success of &quot;Different Class&quot; (1995), friction grew in the band, culminating in the notable departure of guitarist and violinist Russell Senior; frontman Jarvis Cocker left for New York alone to decompress and write in isolation from the rest of the band. These new songs took a much more art rock approach and glam rock influence from its predecessor. After reconciling with the band, work on the album began in November 1996 and finished in January 1998. Lead single &quot;Help the Aged&quot; was released on 10 November 1997, followed by the album&#x27;s title track on 11 March 1998. After the album&#x27;s release on 30 March, two more singles were released: &quot;A Little Soul&quot; on 8 June and &quot;Party Hard&quot; on 7 September.

As with the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;This is Hardcore&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart, but with far fewer sales, and earned Pulp a third successive nomination for the 1998 Mercury Prize. A deluxe edition of &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot; was released on 11 September 2006, containing a second disc of B-sides, demos and rarities.

==Artwork==
The cover photo was art directed by Peter Saville and the American painter John Currin who is known for his figurative paintings of exaggerated female forms. The model photographed is Ksenia Zlobina and the images were further digitally manipulated by Howard Wakefield, who also designed the album. Currin was also the art director for the &quot;Help the Aged&quot; video, based on his painting &quot;The Never Ending Story&quot;. Advertising posters showing the album&#x27;s cover that appeared on the London Underground system were defaced by graffiti artists with slogans like &quot;This Offends Women&quot; and &quot;This is Sexist&quot; or &quot;This is Demeaning&quot;.

The music video for the title track was directed by Doug Nichol and was listed as the No. 47 best video of all time by &quot;NME&quot;. A bonus live CD entitled &quot;This Is Glastonbury&quot; was added to the album later in 1998.

==Commercial performance==
The album had first-week sales of just over 50,000, 62% fewer than &quot;Different Class&quot; first-week sales of 133,000. The album was certified gold by the BPI April 1998 for sales of 100,000. As of 2008, sales in the United States have exceeded 86,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Reception and legacy==
Nick Hornby, writing in &quot;Spin&quot;, proclaimed that on the album &quot;England&#x27;s unofficial poet laureate Jarvis Cocker perfects his poetry of the prosaic&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that &quot;This is Hardcore&quot; was &quot;less bright and bouncy&quot; than its era-defining predecessor, but praised it as being &quot;even more daring and fully realized&quot;, noting that &quot;it plays like a movie, a series of scenes from a life&quot;, and declared that it &quot;is arguably the first pop album devoted entirely to the subject of the long, slow fade&quot;, which it heralded as &quot;a bold move because it breaks one of rock&#x27;s oldest songwriting taboos&quot;. The review concluded, &quot;In midlife oblivion, Pulp have found a strange kind of liberation. Desperation never sounded quite so entertaining.&quot; Reviews in the United States adopted a similar tone, with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; all awarding three and a half stars out of four. The Tribune hailed it as &quot;a smashing album about midlife crisis&quot; and found that &quot;[the] music is sumptuous lounge-lizard rock augmented by strings and noisy disruptions – a clever, catchy &#x27;90s take on the Bowie/Mott/Roxy glam rock of the &#x27;70s.&quot;

In a retrospective assessment of the album&#x27;s impact, Matthew Horton wrote in &quot;NME&quot; that &quot;in its sense of surrender, regret and flashes of panic, it captured the time to a tee.&quot; In an article entitled, &quot;How Pulp&#x27;s &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot; Brought Britpop to a Halt&quot;, Horton maintained that it was &quot;a sloughing-off of fame’s skin, a rejection of the Britpop monster&quot;. He concluded, &quot;It&#x27;s an end, a hard-wrought epitaph to a band&#x27;s jaunt in the limelight and a suitable jump-off point for what had been a rare old few years – for us, at least.&quot; Another review found the song &quot;A Little Soul&quot; to be &quot;Cocker&#x27;s most disconsolately beautiful&quot;, drawing &quot;from the musical blueprint of Smokey Robinson&#x27;s &#x27;Tracks of My Tears.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;This is Hardcore&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 166 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2014, US LGBT magazine &quot;Metro Weekly&quot; placed the album at number 46 in its list of the &quot;50 Best Alternative Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it seventh in &quot;The 50 Best Britpop Albums&quot;.

<doc id="557770" wikidata="Q1254160" url="?curid=557770" title="McMansion">
<text>McMansion is a term for a large house in a suburban community, typically marketed to the middle class in developed countries.

Architectural historian Virginia Savage McAlester, who gave a first description of the common features which define this building style, coined the more neutral term Millennium Mansion. An example of a McWord, &quot;McMansion&quot; associates the generic quality of these luxury houses with that of mass-produced fast food by evoking McDonald&#x27;s, an American restaurant chain.

The neologism &quot;McMansion&quot; seems to have been coined sometime in the early 1980s. It appeared in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1990 and &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1998. Other terms used to describe &quot;McMansions&quot; include &quot;Persian palace&quot;, &quot;Garage Mahal&quot;, &quot;starter castle&quot;, and &quot;Hummer house&quot;. Marketing parlance often uses the term &quot;tract mansions&quot; or executive homes.

==Description==
The term &quot;McMansion&quot; generally denotes a multi-story house that either has no clear architectural style, or prizes superficial appearance and sheer size over quality, often both.

The term may either refer to houses that are oversized, cheaply-built, and developed at once in a subdivision, or houses that replace smaller homes which seem far too large for their lots (such a house may even lack side windows due to the proximity to the boundaries—another related cliché.).

One real-estate writer explains a successful formula typically found in McMansions: &quot;symmetrical structures on clear-cut lots with Palladian windows centered over the main entry, and brick or stone enhancing the driveway entrance, plus multiple chimneys, dormers, pilasters, and columns—and inside, the master suite with dressing rooms and bath-spa, great rooms, breakfast and dining rooms, showplace kitchen, and extra high and wide garages for multiple cars and SUVs.&quot;

These houses also typically have or more of floor area, ceilings 9 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3m) high or higher, a two-story portico, a two-story front door hall (often containing a large chandelier), a garage with room for three or more cars, many bedrooms (with some having five or more), many bathrooms, extensive crown molding and related features, and lavish—if superficial—interior features.

As noted above, a McMansion replacing a smaller house in a community of smaller-sized houses will cover a much larger portion of the lot than the previous house; in the other usage, McMansions are built en masse in homogeneous communities by a single developer.

==Origins==
Beginning in California in the 1980s, the larger home concept was intended to fill a gap between the more modest suburban tract housing and the upscale, often custom, houses found in gated, waterfront, or golf course communities. Such communities were developed as subdivisions, or pre-existing neighborhoods were transformed by building on empty lots or replacing torn-down structures. The larger houses proved popular and demand increased dramatically, particularly in light of new land-management laws that were enacted in the 1980s and 1990s.

Efforts to economize may have led to a decline in quality for many of these new houses, prompting the coinage of the disparaging term. Because these houses emphasize instant gratification, they are almost never designed with energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, maintainability, or longevity in mind.

In a development that runs counter to the previous boom in construction of McMansions, a 2009 report suggested that the Great Recession (2008–2012) has stabilized new house sizes in the United States. However, as the economy recovered, home sizes returned to their upward trend.

Throughout the 2010s, the McMansion style started to fall out of favor, during which the &quot;McModern&quot;, a newer style of single-family home, began to permeate urban neighborhoods of North America. Unlike McMansions&#x27; excessive ornamentation and random architectural style, McModerns emulate modernist architectural styles and are popular with Millennials.

==Attributes==
===Location===
In a city, traditional upscale custom houses are mostly found in the most affluent residential neighbourhoods (commonly regarded as &quot;Millionaires&#x27; Mile&quot;), which are typically gated, waterfront, ravine, or golf course communities, all of which have some of the highest residential property taxes in the city. Most of these communities are usually well-established, and the real estate prices tend to be high but stable. The houses themselves feature architectural preferences in general accordance with the neighborhood.

By contrast, McMansions are typically constructed further from the city center than suburban tract housing. In addition, the land that McMansions are built on is often zoned as agricultural or re-zoned to residential from agricultural, and often outside of the city proper limits, as both of these result in lower property taxes. These areas may be in demand by buyers who desire a bigger house than the tract house, but are unwilling to pay for (or lack the means to afford) houses in the city&#x27;s traditional upscale neighborhoods. Due to this demographic, which is more susceptible to boom and bust economic cycles, prices of McMansions tend to be much more volatile and are often fueled by speculation.

Another reason why McMansions are generally found in outlying suburban areas is that lots in older neighborhoods are often much smaller and not conducive to such residences. McMansions are usually much larger than older houses and constructed among other large houses by a subdivider on speculation; they generally are built &quot;en masse&quot; by a development company to be marketed as premium real estate, but offer few custom features. The construction of what seems to be too large a house on an existing lot will often draw the ire of neighbors and other local residents. In 2006, for example, a recently built house in Kirkland, Washington – an affluent suburb on Seattle&#x27;s Eastside – stood so close to an adjoining property that, in the words of the chair of the city&#x27;s Neighborhood Association, &quot;you can read the lettering on the canned vegetables in the house next door.&quot;

===Design===

McMansions often haphazardly mix a variety of conflicting architectural styles and elements, combining quoins, steeply sloped roofs, multiple roof lines, complicated massing, and pronounced dormers, to produce an appearance that may be considered unpleasant, jumbled, or messy.

The builder may have attempted expensive effects with cheap materials, skimped on details, or hidden defects with cladding:

Frequently, priority in McMansion construction is given to the interior layout. Vaulted ceilings, the master suite, bay windows, and the expansive foyer are emphasized with little regard for how these interior spaces will shape the overall envelope of the structure. In particular, designing individual windows for their effect in individual rooms can cause the exterior to feature numerous windows with an asymmetrical or misaligned layout, in multiple conflicting sizes and styles. It has been claimed that this gives the exterior appearance an &quot;amorphous&quot; or &quot;bloated&quot; quality.

Some neighborhoods, where most or all the houses have the same layout and design with minor differences, such as siding or shutter color, are often called &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; neighborhoods.

==Economics==
From the perspective of a housebuilder, luxury houses of or more are more profitable than smaller houses. Multiple communities, like in California and Virginia, have few residential lots available; thus, those builders who acquire them are likely to build a luxury house. In 2014, 32% of the new houses being built had or more of floor space, and the average size of new construction had increased to over .

==Worldwide==
McMansions have seen rising popularity in China, where there have been replicas of famous buildings such as the White House and the Palace of Versailles.

==Criticism==
The widespread disdain for the McMansion stems from perceptions that these houses look and feel inappropriate (either by themselves or for a given neighborhood), are extremely wasteful due to their inefficient land usage from suburban sprawl and single-family zoning and the large amounts of materials and utilities needed to construct them, and increase commute times significantly. Some go even further, saying that these houses give an impression that their owners lack taste or refinement or are pretentious, or that they show a general discordance in architectural preferences.

In Australia, the main reason McMansions have received a very cold reception is because the archetypal Australian house is generally a single story, red brick house or a bungalow, and because many McMansions use cement render materials perceived as giving an extremely exaggerated appearance. When older and modest houses are often bought as teardowns and McMansions constructed on the vacant land, one observer notes that many instances have occurred where &quot;a poor house stands side by side with a good house.&quot;

The blog &quot;McMansion Hell&quot;, by Kate Wagner, has been critiquing McMansions since June 2016.

<doc id="557792" wikidata="Q17026396" url="?curid=557792" title="Rubbery Figures">
<text>Rubbery Figures was a satirical rubber puppet series and segment that screened in Australia in various forms from 1984 to 1990. The series ran on the ABC until 1988, when it was axed and subsequently revived as a segment on Seven Network&#x27;s &quot;Fast Forward&quot; in April 1989. It featured puppets of major political and social characters.

== Production ==

The &quot;Rubbery Figures&quot; programs were made in the Melbourne film studio of Peter Nicholson, who also made the puppets themselves. Almost all the character voices for the puppets were performed by Melbourne voice actor Paul Jennings.

== Fast Forward&#x27;s &quot;Rubbery Figures&quot; ==

Steve Vizard, the man behind Channel Seven&#x27;s &quot;Fast Forward&quot; had seen &quot;Rubbery Figures&quot; on the ABC and thought they would make a good point of difference from competing comedy sketch series. Due to budget constraints, Peter Nicholson semi autonomously produced five minute segments that could be inserted into the programme. During this period the figures expanded into less current political satire; for example the puppets of Prime Minister Bob Hawke and then Treasurer Paul Keating played the parts of Captain Kirk and Mr Spock on board the enterprise.

=== Characters ===

==== Australian politicians ====

The primary characters of &quot;Rubbery Figures&quot; were politicians native to Australia. The &quot;Rubbery Figures&quot; political characters included:

*Bob Hawke – portrayed as a self-centred, power-hungry opportunist
*Paul Keating – depicted as Hawke&#x27;s down-to-earth but ambitious crony
*John Howard – an irritating, nerdy loser
*Andrew Peacock – vain and snobbish, often seen filing his nails
*Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen – senile and rambling, with a tendency for malapropism (&quot;you mark my verbs&quot;)
*John Elliott – a beer-swilling &quot;yobbo&quot;, with his catchphrase of &quot;pig&#x27;s arse&quot;

==== International politicians ====

&quot;Rubbery Figures&quot; also satirised prominent world politicians of the time, among them were:

*Margaret Thatcher – the then-Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; an eccentric profiteer, eager to sell to the Australian government
*Ronald Reagan – the then-President of the United States; portrayed as a lumberjack, making decisions based on his horoscope
*Mikhail Gorbachev – former General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; an easygoing liberal who was always giving himself time off
*Muammar al-Gaddafi – former ruler of Libya, whose puppet was permanently impaled by a missile with the letters &quot;USA&quot; painted on one side

==Comparison with &quot;Spitting Image&quot;==
The &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; noted in 1988 that &quot;People think creator Peter Nicholson borrowed the idea for Rubbery Figures from the British puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. But Nicholson quickly points out he created his puppets before &quot;Spitting Image&quot; was shown in Australia&quot;. Nicholson told the &quot;Herald&quot;: &quot;The programs are from slightly different traditions...Ours springs more from the newspaper political cartoon than the comedy tradition of &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. They are probably more gratuitous. Their people are a bit unkind. They set out to deliberately make people look terrible, whereas I think our people should look a bit redeemable&quot;.

== Music ==

In 1991, a music track called &quot;The Recession Rap&quot; with the rubbery figures was released. The music and lyrics were written by David Atkin, Peter Benson and Troy Hazard, the music was produced by David Atkin and Peter Benson and the characters were sung by Paul Jennings. It reached #60 on the ARIA Chart in August.

== On Exhibition ==
Although no longer being viewed on television, the Figures appeared at several exhibitions in the 1990s. In 1993, they were recast and refurbished to take part in &quot;The Exhibition We Had To Have&quot; at the National Gallery of Victoria as part of the Melbourne Comedy Festival. In 1994, &quot;The Rubbery Years&quot; in conjunction with the National Museum ran for six months at Old Parliament House in Canberra.

<doc id="557799" wikidata="Q1934974" url="?curid=557799" title="We Love Life">
<text>We Love Life is the seventh studio album by English rock band Pulp, released on 22 October 2001 by Island Records. It reached number six on the UK Albums Chart, with a total chart stay of only three weeks. Written and recorded after the tumultuous sessions for &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot;, &quot;We Love Life&quot; saw the band move toward a more relaxed and natural sound, shepherded by producer and famed singer-songwriter Scott Walker. Walker had replaced original producer Chris Thomas, whom the band had worked with on the band&#x27;s two previous albums.

==Background==
&quot;We Love Life&quot; was intended to be a departure from the disillusionment of the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot;, in that it featured a more organic sound and an emphasis on nature, which Cocker found interest in &quot;because it is dangerous in some ways&quot;. Cocker explained, &quot;I never took any notice of nature when I was a kid. I thought we&#x27;d all be living on space stations or floating metropolises by now. But after &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot;, which was a very alienated record, it was time to go back to simpler things, like this, the natural world.&quot; At the same time, Cocker stated, &quot;This isn&#x27;t Pulp&#x27;s pastoral album. I was very aware of avoiding hippy dippy stuff.&quot;

The band had initially begun recording with Chris Thomas, who had produced their past two albums. However, his more rigid style of recording conflicted with the band&#x27;s desire for looser sessions, resulting in the recordings being shelved. The final album was produced by Scott Walker. Keyboardist Candida Doyle recalled, &quot;I certainly thought about leaving [after shelving the Thomas sessions] but I realised that I&#x27;d still feel shit even if I did. If Scott Walker hadn&#x27;t come about, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;d have bothered to finish this LP.&quot; The band, who had met Walker at the 2000 Meltdown Festival run by Walker, had been longtime fans of Walker.

Walker&#x27;s own album &quot;&#x27;Til the Band Comes In&quot; is mocked in the lyrics of the &quot;We Love Life&quot; single &quot;Bad Cover Version&quot;. Cocker claims the lyric was written long before Walker became involved in the album&#x27;s production and recalled the moment of recording the song as &quot;embarrassing&quot;.

==Title and artwork==
The album&#x27;s title was originally to be &quot;Pulp Love Life&quot;, but this was vetoed as Cocker felt that the title looked confusing on an album cover—he explained, &quot;It always looked like the name of the band&#x27;s Pulp and the album&#x27;s called &quot;Love Life&quot;.&quot; The album was then renamed &quot;Pulp&quot;, reflecting the &quot;uncluttered&quot; nature of the album. With the September 11 terrorist attacks, however, the album was renamed to the more universal &quot;We Love Life&quot;. Cocker recalled, &quot;To be honest, I was really freaked out when that World Trade Center thing happened. ... So in the aftermath of that, I thought, actually this &quot;Love Life&quot; business isn&#x27;t a bad sentiment at this particular time.&quot;

The minimal cover art (by Peter Saville) shows a set of initial capitals held in the collection of St. Bride Printing Library in London. They were engraved in wood by or for Louis Pouchée around the 1820s. It would later inspire the artwork for American metal band Deafheaven&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Sunbather&quot;.

==Reception==
Initial critical response to &quot;We Love Life&quot; was very positive. The album received an average score of 84 at Metacritic, based on 20 reviews. The music review online magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;We Love Life&quot; at number 194 on their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s.

Steve Hobbs of &quot;Q Magazine&quot; wrote of the album, &quot;Cocker&#x27;s lyrics are still sharp and beautifully observed, just a little less personal. But in many ways, it&#x27;s a more familiar Pulp record than &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot;.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the album &quot;an emotional and musical breakthrough, finding the band leaping beyond the claustrophobic &quot;Hardcore&quot; and consolidating their previous obsessions, creating a textured, reflective record that in its own measured way is as impassioned as &quot;Different Class&quot;.&quot;

<text>Nektaspida (also called Naraoiida, Nektaspia and Nectaspida) is an extinct order of non-mineralised artiopodan arthropods. They are known from the lower-Cambrian to the upper Silurian. Originally classified as trilobites, which they superficially resemble, they are now placed as close relatives as members of the Trilobitomorpha within Artiopoda. The order is divided into three major families; Emucarididae, Liwiidae, and Naraoiidae.

== Naming history and taxonomic placement ==

The order was originally proposed by Raymond in 1920 as Nektaspia. Størmer corrected it to Nectaspida for the 1959 &quot;Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology&quot; to conform with the names of the other trilobite orders. Whittington described it in 1985 with the spelling Nektaspida; the revised 1997 Treatise by Raymond and Fortey uses this spelling, as do other modern works. Whittington (1985) placed the order in the Trilobita. Cotton &amp; Braddy (2000) place it in a new &quot;Trilobite clade&quot; containing the Trilobita, recognizing the close affinities of the nektaspids to trilobites. However this necessitates the inclusion of genera that look very little like trilobites., it was formerly placed in the stem-group to the chelicerata subdivision of the Arthropoda phylum. However, it currently considered part of Artiopoda, the clade that contains trilobites and their close relatives.

The group is united by several morphological characters, including reduced or absent lateral eyes, a hypostome with a natant attachment, extensive articulation overlap between unfused trunk tergites, and fused pleurae that do not form lateral spines. Preserved soft tissue of the group indicates that the cephalic (head) shield of nektaspids and liwiids contained branched digestive glands. The Naraoiidae have their exoskeletons mostly composed of only two major shields, which have a single articulation point.

== Ecology ==
The naraoiids have been interpreted as benthic organisms that were opportunistic scavengers and predators of soft-bodied prey, with the spine-like endites of the limbs possibly allowing soft-bodied prey to be shredded before ingestion. The differences in gut morphology between some species of naraoiids suggests that some species only intermittently fed, while others regularly fed.

== Evolutionary history ==
The group first appeared and was most diverse in the Cambrian, especially during the Cambrian Series 2. Emucarididae are only known from the Cambrian Series 2 of East Gondwana (now Australia) and the then nearby South China. Naraoiidae were diverse in low latitudes during Cambrian Series 2 and the following Miaolingian in Laurentia and in South China. Liwiidae first appeared in Baltica during the Cambrian, and are absent from major Cambrian deposits elsewhere during this period, but are widespread in the southern high-latitude margin of Gondwana during the Ordovician. The youngest known member of the group is the Laurentian naraoiid &quot;Naraoia bertensis&quot; from the Bertie Formation in Ontario, Canada, dating to the Upper Silurian.

<text>Marcus Dwayne Dixon (born September 16, 1984) is an American football coach and a former defensive end in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys and New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He is the defensive line coach for the Minnesota Vikings. Dixon was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2008. He played college football at Hampton University.

Dixon is also known for a 2003 court case in which, whilst still at high school, he was convicted of statutory rape and aggravated child molestation. The latter charge was later overturned by the Georgia Supreme Court.

==Early life==
Dixon was a grade A student and excelled on the football field to the point where he had been offered a full scholarship at Vanderbilt University, which he was unable to undertake due to his subsequent imprisonment.

==College career==
Upon his release from prison, Dixon accepted a football scholarship from Division I-AA Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia.

==Professional career==
===Dallas Cowboys===
In 2010, Dixon saw limited playing time during preseason. He was released on September 4, 2010.

===New York Jets===
On September 5, 2010, Dixon was claimed off waivers by the New York Jets.

An exclusive rights free agent, Dixon was signed to a one-year contract on January 26, 2011.

Dixon was released on September 1, 2012. He was re-signed to the active roster on September 4. He appeared in 3 games, before being released on September 24.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
On February 9, 2013, Dixon was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs. He was cut on August 31.

===Tennessee Titans===
On January 3, 2014, Dixon was signed to a futures contract with the Tennessee Titans. He was released during final cuts on August 29.

===BC Lions===
On October 20, 2014, Dixon was signed to the BC Lions practice roster in the Canadian Football League. He made his CFL debut in the final game of the regular season against the Calgary Stampeders. He was re-signed on March 2, 2015. He retired on April 30, 2015.

==Coaching career==
===Rams===
The Los Angeles Rams hired Dixon as their assistant defensive line coach on February 23, 2021. Dixon won his first Super Bowl championship when the Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI.

===Denver Broncos===
On February 18, 2022, Dixon was hired by the Denver Broncos to serve as the team&#x27;s defensive line coach for the 2022 season.

==Personal life==
===Dixon v. State case===
Kristie Brown alleged that on February 10, 2003, Dixon forced her to have sex, taking her virginity. She has stated that contrary to Dixon&#x27;s supporters&#x27; belief, she was never Dixon&#x27;s girlfriend and although they shared classes, they barely knew each other. The jury acquitted Dixon of rape, battery, assault and false imprisonment, but because Brown was only 15 and Dixon 18 at the time of the incident found him guilty of statutory rape and aggravated child molestation. Because of this Dixon was convicted at the mandatory amount under Georgia law, 10 years imprisonment. If he had been found guilty of rape, he would have faced a much less severe punishment.

Supporters of Dixon including the NAACP and the Rev. Joseph Lowery&#x27;s People&#x27;s Agenda alleged the charges were racially motivated. The President of the Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman called it a &quot;Legal Lynching&quot;.

===Overturned conviction and release===
The Georgia Supreme Court overturned Dixon&#x27;s conviction for child molestation and he was released the same day, on May 3, 2004. The court let his conviction for misdemeanor statutory rape stand. After Dixon&#x27;s release both he and Brown appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in an attempt to clarify their stories.

<text>Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (formerly known as L Brands, Inc., Limited Brands, Inc. and The Limited, Inc.) is an American specialty retail company based in Columbus, Ohio. It owns Bath &amp; Body Works, posted $7.4 billion in revenue in 2023, and was listed as 481 on the 2024 Fortune 500 list of largest United States companies by revenue.

In February 2020, L Brands announced the planned sale of its Victoria&#x27;s Secret division to Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm. Under the agreement, Sycamore Partners would gain a 55% controlling stake in Victoria&#x27;s Secret while L Brands would keep a 45% stake, leaving Bath &amp; Body Works to become L Brand&#x27;s sole business. The sale fell through in May 2020, although CEO Les Wexner did step down as planned, and was succeeded by Andrew Meslow. Gina Boswell was appointed the new CEO effective December 1, 2022, replacing Andrew Meslow who stepped down in May 2022. She replaced the interim CEO, Sarah Nash.

In March 2021, L Brands announced it would spin off Victoria&#x27;s Secret as a stand-alone publicly traded company, and then change its name to Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. As of August 3, 2021, the separation was complete, and Bath and Body Works stock started trading under the ticker symbol &quot;BBWI&quot;.

==History==

===Origins===
Bella Cabakoff was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and moved to Columbus as a toddler. At age 21, she became the youngest buyer for the Lazarus department store chain. After spending over 20 years working for Lazarus, in 1951, she and her husband Harry Wexner opened a women&#x27;s clothing store named Leslie&#x27;s on State Street. The store was named after their son, Leslie &quot;Les&quot; Wexner, and he began working there when he was attending college at Ohio State University.

In 1963, Wexner borrowed $5,000 from his aunt and $5,000 from the bank and opened a store at the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington, Ohio. This store was named &quot;The Limited&quot; because the store focused on clothing for younger women, unlike his parents&#x27; general merchandise store. Later, in 1964, Bella and Harry closed their store to join their son in his venture.

===1970s–present===
The original board consisted of only the three family members and longtime friend Jim Waldron, who served as Senior Vice President. Bella Wexner served as secretary until her death in 2001, Harry as chairman (he served until his death in 1975), and Leslie, CEO from inception, later succeeded his father as the chairman. , he and his family continued to own 17% of LB. In 1969, Wexner took The Limited Brands public and sold 47,600 shares at $7.25 a share. In 1977, The Limited moved into its main headquarters on Morse Road in Columbus, from which L Brands still operates today. In 1982, The Limited was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

L Brands shareholders filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of Delaware on January 14, 2021, stating that former chair Wexner, among others, created an &quot;entrenched culture of misogyny, bullying and harassment&quot; and was aware of abuses being committed by accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, which breached his fiduciary duty to the company, causing devaluation of the brand. The complaint also names Wexner&#x27;s wife, Abigail, current chair Sarah E. Nash, and former marketing officer Ed Razek, whose &quot;widely known misconduct&quot; was long allowed at the company.

In February 2021, L Brands announced the retirement of CFO Stuart Burgdoerfer in August of that year, to be replaced by CEO of Victoria&#x27;s Secret Martin Waters. Mr. Burgdoerfer stated he was &quot;grateful to have had the opportunity to work with extraordinary people in every part of the business.&quot;

In December 2021, a candle factory owned and operated by Mayfield Consumer Products was destroyed by a tornado. Several employees died and dozens were trapped because supervisors did not allow employees to leave in preparation for the weather. This factory was a major supplier of Bath &amp; Body Works scented candles.

In 2023, Bath and Body Works announced that its whole production system had relocated to the outskirts of Columbus, Ohio. Ten of the company&#x27;s suppliers agreed to make the move to the United States, adding 5,000 employees and increasing annual revenue by $2 billion. The company said the decision to move production to the United States was a result of frustration over shipping delays which required 3 months lead time, rather than just 21 days when produced in Ohio.

=== Acquisitions ===

The 1980s started a string of acquisitions. In 1982, the Victoria&#x27;s Secret brand, store, and catalogue were purchased from Roy Raymond for $1 million. Also in 1982, 207 Lane Bryant stores were purchased. In 1985, the exclusive Henri Bendel store on Fifth Avenue in New York City was purchased for $10 million and 798 Lerner stores for $297 million. Finally, in 1988, 25 Abercrombie &amp; Fitch stores were purchased for $46 million. In 1996, The Limited ended its ownership of the A&amp;F brand; it was spun off into a publicly traded company.

The 1990s saw initial development of the Limited Too, Bath &amp; Body Works, Structure, and Victoria&#x27;s Secret Beauty. 
In 1998, several Bath &amp; Body Works stores were converted to The White Barn Candle Company stores to begin a home fragrance brand.

In 2005, Limited Brands purchased home fragrance manufacturer Slatkin &amp; Company.

=== Divestitures ===
On August 3, 2007, Limited Brands sold 75% ownership of its flagship The Limited chain to buyout firm Sun Capital Partners, Inc. In 2010, the remaining 25% of shares were also purchased by Sun Capital. Stefan M. Selig from Bank of America was involved in these deals. Following the sale of their namesake store, Limited Brands changed their company name to L Brands, as per the terms of the sale. On January 7, 2017, The Limited closed all of its stores in the United States. The web retail operation, thelimited.com, was initially continued for business and shipping nationwide. Despite this, The Limited online soon filed for bankruptcy and discontinued all services. However, the brand was revived in mid-2017 by Sycamore Partners subsidiary Belk and Limited-branded merchandise became available on its website.

On February 20, 2020, L Brands announced that it would sell its Victoria&#x27;s Secret division to Sycamore Partners, private equity firm. Under the agreement, Sycamore Partners would gain a 55% controlling stake in Victoria&#x27;s Secret for about $525 million. L Brands would keep a 45% stake. leaving Bath &amp; Body Works to potentially become L Brand&#x27;s sole business. L Brands also announced that CEO Leslie Wexner was stepping down. On May 4, 2020, L Brands and Sycamore Partners announced a &quot;mutual termination&quot; of their deal, and settlement of related litigation.

At the May 14, 2020, virtual shareholders meeting, L Brands founder, CEO and board chair Les Wexner stepped down, Bath &amp; Body Works CEO Andrew Meslow moved up to become CEO of L Brands and joined the board, and three directors stepped down. The company announced it would go forward with a spin-off of Victoria&#x27;s Secret as a stand-alone company. It also announced it would close 250 Victoria&#x27;s Secret Stores and 50 Bath and Body Works stores.

On September 14, 2020, L Brands announced that it would sell its majority stake in its Victoria&#x27;s Secret UK business to Next Plc under a newly formed joint venture. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

In 2021, L Brands announced Victoria&#x27;s Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works had been recast into two separate Publicly Traded Companies, expected to be completed by August. The Current L Brands CEO Andrew Meslow will be the head of Bath &amp; Body Works while Martin Waters will be the head of Victoria&#x27;s Secret after the split

On August 3, 2021, The Columbus-based retailer officially split into two companies — Victoria&#x27;s Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works. The split went into effect Monday, and the companies began trading individually on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday morning. L Brands decided in May to move ahead with a split after initially deciding to sell a 55% stake in Victoria&#x27;s Secret for $500 million in February 2020. That deal was called off because of the pandemic. The name L Brands is no longer used as the name changed to Bath &amp; Body Works Inc.

<doc id="557816" wikidata="Q335501" url="?curid=557816" title="Charles Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe">
<text>Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, 1st Baron Metcalfe, (30 January 1785 – 5 September 1846), known as Sir Charles Metcalfe, Bt between 1822 and 1845, was a British colonial administrator. He held appointments including acting Governor-General of India, Governor of Jamaica and Governor General of the Province of Canada.

==Early life and background==
Metcalfe was born on 30 January 1785 in Lecture House, Calcutta then part of the Bengal Presidency.

He was the second son of Thomas Metcalfe and Susannah Selina Sophia Debonnaire. His father first went to India in 1767 as a cadet in the British Army, and at the time of Metcalfe&#x27;s birth was serving as a major in the Bengal Army. He later became a Member of Parliament, director of the British East India Company and was created a baronet on 21 December 1802. Thomas Metcalfe married Susannah in Calcutta in 1782. She was the daughter of merchant John Debonnaire, a trader at Fort St. George, Madras, who subsequently settled at the Cape of Good Hope. It was her second marriage, her first being with Major John Smith in Madras from 1776 until his death. His parents returned to England shortly after the birth of their son.

Metcalfe&#x27;s elder sister was Emily Theophila, later becoming the Viscountess Ashbrook. A younger brother, Thomas, also went on to achieve distinction as a civil servant with the East India Company.

==Education==
Metcalfe spent four years at Eton College in Berkshire, before arriving in Bengal on 1 January 1801, a month before his sixteenth birthday. He then studied Oriental languages as the first student at Lord Wellesley&#x27;s Fort William College.

==India==
===Early career===

At the age of nineteen, Metcalfe was appointed political assistant to General Lake, who was then conducting the final campaign of the Second Anglo-Maratha War against Yashwantrao Holkar.

In 1808 he was selected by Lord Minto for the responsible post of envoy to the court of Ranjit Singh at Lahore; here, on 25 April 1809, he concluded the important Treaty of Amritsar securing the independence of the Sikh states between the Sutlej and the Jumna.

His first tenure as Resident at Delhi began on 25 February 1811 for the East India Company (from 1813 for the British Government), and in 1819 he received from Lord Hastings the appointment of secretary in the secret and political department. From 1820 to 1825 Sir Charles (who succeeded his brother in the baronetcy in 1822) was resident at the court of the Nizam, and afterwards was summoned in an emergency to his former post at Delhi.

===Agra===

On 14 November 1834 Metcalfe was posted as Governor of the Presidency of Agra where he served for over four months till 20 March 1835.

===Acting Governor-General===
In 1827 he obtained a seat in the supreme council, and in March 1835, after he had acted as the first governor of the proposed new presidency of Agra, he provisionally succeeded Lord William Bentinck as the Governor-General of Bengal (1835–36). During his brief tenure of office (it lasted for only one year) he carried out several important measures, including that for the liberation of the press, which, while almost universally popular, complicated his relations with the directors at home to such an extent that he resigned the service of the Company in 1838. In 1835 he was also appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB).

===North-Western Provinces===
Metcalfe was Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces from 1 June 1836 to 1 June 1838.
In 1838 he retired from service with the East India Company and settled in England.

==Jamaica==

In 1839, Metcalfe accepted an appointment by the Second Melbourne ministry to the governorship of Jamaica, where labour difficulties created by the recent passing of the Slavery Abolition Act called for a high degree of tact and ability. Metcalfe&#x27;s administration was successful in addressing the complaints of both labourers and their employers and bringing a greater sense of unity amongst the different factions. Ill health hastened his resignation and on 24 May 1842 he left Jamaica for England.

==Canada==
Six months afterwards he was appointed by the Peel ministry to the post of Governor General of the Province of Canada with instructions to resist further development of responsible government. A clash soon emerged between Metcalfe and the leaders of the legislative assembly, Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine. Despite suffering from worsening cancer, he fought to preserve the prerogatives of the Crown and the governor&#x27;s control over the administration and patronage. He nonetheless had to make some concessions to win support, and the most notable of these was persuading the Colonial Office to grant amnesty to the rebels of 1837-38, and to abandon forced anglicization of the French-speaking population.

==Final years==
Metcalfe&#x27;s success in Canada carrying out the policy of the home government was rewarded with a peerage shortly after his return to England, with the title Baron Metcalfe, of Fern Hill in the County of Berkshire in 1845. But his success did not endure and responsible government would be conceded by his successor James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin. Metcalfe died of skin cancer at Malshanger in Oakley, near Basingstoke, on 5 September 1846. His residence was however at Fernhill Park in Winkfield, near Windsor and it was in the parish church there that he was buried.

==Personal life==
When in Lahore, Metcalfe began a relationship with a Punjabi Sikh woman who bore him three sons. Metcalfe was open about this relationship, and sent all three sons to England to be educated. One of his sons, James Metcalfe, became a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Bengal Army.

<doc id="557830" wikidata="Q24897872" url="?curid=557830" title="Graduate diploma">
<text>A graduate diploma (GradD, GDip, GrDip, GradDip) is generally a qualification taken after completion of a first degree, although the level of study varies in different countries from being at the same level as the final year of a bachelor&#x27;s degree to being at a level between a master&#x27;s degree and a doctorate. In some countries the graduate diploma and postgraduate diploma are synonymous, while in others (particularly where the graduate diploma is at undergraduate degree level) the postgraduate diploma is a higher qualification.

==Australia==
The graduate diploma is normally taken following a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and some master&#x27;s degree programs have graduate diploma as a nested (interim) award. The qualification is at level 8 of the Australian Qualifications Framework, the same as an honours degree. This qualification is at the same level as the post graduate diploma qualifications awarded in New Zealand institutions and Australian graduate diplomas should not be confused with New Zealand graduate diplomas as they belong to two different qualification levels.

==Canada==
Graduate diplomas offered in Canada (French: &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures spécialisées&quot;) are typically taken following a bachelor&#x27;s degree and a successful award allows progression to a master&#x27;s degree. Depending on the institution, a graduate diploma in Canada may be at graduate level or bachelor&#x27;s level. Similar courses at other Canadian institutions may be termed postgraduate diplomas at graduate level and post-baccalaureate diploma at bachelor&#x27;s level.

==Denmark==
In Denmark there are two forms of master&#x27;s degree. The master&#x27;s degree or candidatus is a FQ-EHEA second-cycle qualification worth 120 ECTS credits. These degrees are research-based and offered through universities (e.g. University of Copenhagen and Copenhagen Business School). The second form is the Graduate Diploma within the adult further education system, which is worth 60 ECTS credits and is taught part-time. The graduate diploma is normally taken following a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Diplomas (in Danish: HD) are studied in business-related fields such as Business Administration and Innovation Management. Programs are normally split into Part 1 (graduate certificate) and Part 2 (graduate diploma), each being 60 ECTS Credits (one year of full-time-equivalent study).

==India==
In India the graduate diploma, comes one level before a master&#x27;s degree–level qualification which are usually is a 3/4-year specialized programs. Certain institutes provide master&#x27;s level programs with increased number lower credit courses for two years. At times for transnational equivalency the same is casually noted as graduate diplomas. Advanced diplomas provided are equivalent to a post-baccalaureate diploma; this is a one to three-year course.

==Ireland==
In Ireland, the graduate diploma or post-graduate diploma is a level 9 award on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) which is the same level as a masters degree. The higher diploma is an award at level 8, the same level as an honours bachelor&#x27;s degree. These programmes generally consist of one year of full-time study and are usually taken after, and/or in a different subject from, an earlier bachelor&#x27;s degree. A wide variety of courses are offered; it is also possible to progress to a master&#x27;s degree.

The diploma is generally in two forms:
* A reorientation type qualification to reskill a graduate with new specialised skills, for instance the &quot;HDipStats - Higher Diploma in Statistics&quot; is aimed at offering additional skills in statistics. See also Higher Diploma.
* A professional type qualification which is necessary to enter a profession, for instance the HDipEd - Higher Diploma in Education allows a person to register and practice teaching. See also Postgraduate Diploma.

The graduate diploma (GradDip) is offered by University College Dublin, the Technological University Dublin, Dublin City University, HETAC, the University of Limerick, and the Atlantic Technological University. The higher diploma (HDip) is offered by HETAC, NUI institutions, and Trinity College, Dublin.

==Malaysia==
The graduate diploma forms part of the lifelong education pathway on the Malaysian Qualifications Framework. They are qualifications at the level of a bachelor&#x27;s degree but with half of the credit value.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, a graduate diploma is an advanced undergraduate qualification normally completed after a bachelor&#x27;s degree or done at the same time as the bachelors study, and can be used as a bridging qualification to prove a student&#x27;s ability to undertake postgraduate studies for a completely different field. A graduate diploma (e.g., Graduate Diploma in Education etc.) is different from a postgraduate diploma, which is a course of study at postgraduate level (e.g., Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Psychology etc.). In universities and learning institutes, a graduate diploma is commonly studied by students who have already graduated in a different field and allows them to pursue a new profession. It mainly involves undertaking courses in an accelerated undergraduate level (e.g., normally a mixture of second and third year courses from the bachelor&#x27;s degree) in order for the student to attain the requirements equivalent to a student who studied towards an undergraduate degree.

==Singapore ==
A Graduate Diploma offered by Singapore&#x27;s autonomous universities is a postgraduate qualification that generally requires a Bachelor&#x27;s degree for entry. It is designed to provide specialised knowledge and skills in a specific field of study, often to enhance professional expertise or prepare for further academic pursuits. Typically, these programs last for about one year of full-time study or up to 18 months part-time. For example, NUS offers Graduate Diplomas in areas like Public Health, Systems Analysis, Maritime Law &amp; Arbitration, Medicine fields, and Arts &amp; Social Sciences fields. NTU offers Graduate Diploma in fields like Sports Medicine. SUSS offers a range of Graduate Diplomas, including in fields like Management, Analytics and Visualisation, among others, with 30 academic credit units from these diplomas often being stackable towards a relevant SUSS Master&#x27;s degree.

A WSQ Graduate Diploma is a high-level qualification under the Singapore&#x27;s Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) system, a national framework for training, developing, assessing, and certifying workforce skills and competencies. These diplomas are typically offered through bite-sized training modules, allowing individuals to learn at their own pace. Upon completing each module, participants receive a Statement of Attainment (SOA). Accumulating the relevant SOAs leads to the achievement of a WSQ Graduate Diploma. As WSQ Graduate Diplomas are not postgraduate qualifications offered by Singapore&#x27;s autonomous universities, they do not include academic units that can be stackable towards a Master&#x27;s degree.

Graduate Diplomas are also offered at various academic levels by Singapore&#x27;s private education institutes (PEI), and these diplomas are generally awarded by the PEI or overseas universities. Graduate Diplomas awarded by overseas universities follow their countries&#x27; education system.

==United Kingdom ==
In the UK, a graduate diploma is a short course, with a value of 80–120 UK credits (equivalent to 40–60 ECTS credits), that is normally studied by students who have already graduated in another field. Graduate diplomas are distinguished from graduate certificates by having a longer period of study, equivalent to two thirds of an academic year or more. Until the 1990s, the British conservatoires of music offered three year undergraduate courses to some of their students, leading the award of the Graduate Diploma, e.g. GRSM, GTCL, equivalent to a university first degree in music. When a number of conservatoires became affiliated to or constituent colleges of universities, the graduate diplomas were gradually replaced by the award of the BMus degree to all successful students.

A graduate diploma should not be confused with a postgraduate diploma, which is a master&#x27;s degree-level qualification in the UK. Historically, this has not always been the case, with postgraduate diploma and graduate diploma used interchangeably, but the Quality Assurance Agency now makes a clear distinction between these titles. Some institutions have renamed courses as a result, e.g. The College of Law renamed the official title for its law conversion course from &quot;Postgraduate Diploma in Law&quot; to &quot;Graduate Diploma in Law&quot; as, although the law conversion course is studied postgraduately, the contents of the course are only undergraduate in nature.

In 2018, the Royal College of Art launched a new Graduate Diploma in Art and Design programme aimed at preparing graduate students for its master&#x27;s degree programmes in Art and Design.

==United States==
In the US, graduate diplomas are &quot;Intermediate Graduate Qualifications&quot; involving study beyond master&#x27;s level but not reaching doctoral level. They are generally found in professional, rather than academic, fields. Other qualifications at this level include advanced graduate certificates, specialist certificates and specialist degrees.

<text>Freedom of conscience is the freedom of an individual to act upon their moral beliefs. In particular, it often refers to the freedom to &quot;not do&quot; something one is normally obliged, ordered or expected to do. An individual exercising this freedom may be called a &quot;conscientious objector&quot;.

The right to freedom of conscience is recognized by several international conventions, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. It is distinct from but closely related to freedom of thought, freedom of expression and freedom of religion.

<text>USS &quot;Chicago&quot; (CA-136/CG-11) was a heavy cruiser laid down on 28 July 1943 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US, by the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Launched on 20 August 1944, she was sponsored by Mrs. Edward J. Kelly, wife of the Mayor of Chicago, Illinois, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 10 January 1945, Captain Richard R. Hartung, USN, in command. She served in some of the last battles around the Japan home islands in WWII, and as part of the post war occupation fleet. Decommissioned after the war, she was refitted as a missile cruiser beginning in the late 1950s and recommissioned in 1964, serving during the Vietnam War. She served until 1980. 

==World War II==
&quot;Chicago&quot; spent her first six weeks preparing for sea duty before departing on 26 February 1945 for Norfolk. After conducting training exercises, and calibrating her compasses in Chesapeake Bay, the cruiser got underway on 12 March for the Gulf of Paria, Trinidad. Arriving on 18 March, the cruiser conducted shakedown training and shore bombardment exercises off Culebra, Puerto Rico, before returning to Norfolk on 11 April. Following inspections and battle problem training, the cruiser sailed to Philadelphia for post-shakedown repair availability on 16 April.

In company with the destroyer , the cruiser departed for the Caribbean on 7 May, en route to the Pacific Ocean. Designed to operate offensively with strike and amphibious forces, &quot;Chicago&quot; spent her transit time conducting various anti-air drills, gunnery exercises, and radar tracking training. After refueling at San Juan, Puerto Rico, on 11 May, the ships spent three days conducting gunnery practice before departing for Colon, Canal Zone, on 15 May. With transit complete the next day, the ships arrived at Pearl Harbor on 31 May.

Following another period of gunnery, day battle, anti-aircraft, and shore bombardment exercises off Kahoolawe Island, the cruiser departed for Eniwetok, Marshall Islands, on 28 June. In company with the battleship , &quot;Chicago&quot; arrived at the atoll on 5 July and immediately refueled from . Underway that same day, with the destroyer , added for anti-submarine screen, the ships joined Rear Admiral Radford&#x27;s Task Group 38.4 north of the Mariana Islands on 8 July.

Added to the anti-aircraft screen, &quot;Chicago&quot; guarded the Task Group&#x27;s carriers as they conducted air strikes against the Tokyo Plains area, Honshū, Japan, on 10 July. After refueling on 12 July, the Task Group returned to the Japanese coast and launched air strikes against airfields, shipping, and railways in the northern Honshū and Hokkaidō areas the next day.

On 14 July, in company with the battleships , , , cruiser , and nine destroyers of Rear Admiral Shafroth&#x27;s bombardment unit, &quot;Chicago&quot; closed northern Honshū to bombard the Kamaishi industrial area. At 1212, the cruiser joined the battleships in firing on the iron works and warehouses. Although heavy smoke obscured the target from the cruiser&#x27;s spotting planes, the combination of pre-plotting the target through photo reconnaissance and radar positioning data allowed &quot;Chicago&quot;″s guns to start fires in numerous buildings, several large warehouses, and among nearby oil tanks. At 1251, the cruiser&#x27;s secondary battery guns began firing on a Japanese destroyer-escort type vessel. The escort was straddled and hit by 5 in shell fire, began smoking, and retired into the harbor. The Task Force retired at 1426, leaving the port under a pall of black smoke.

The following day, &quot;Chicago&quot; operated as &quot;a temporary seaplane carrier&quot; when the battleship transferred her SC Seahawk floatplanes to the cruiser. By hanging one plane over the side with the crane the crew was still able to launch a Seahawk from the catapult for spotting services. After replenishment operations on 16 July, the cruiser resumed screening the carriers as they launched air strikes over the Tokyo Plains, northern Honshū and Hokkaidō, and the Kure-Kobe area over the next two weeks.

On 29 July, in company with and several American battleships, &quot;Chicago&quot; participated in a night shore bombardment mission against the port of Hamamatsu. Using radar, and assisted by spotting planes dropping flares and rockets, the ships fired at bridges, factories and the rail yard for about an hour. Rejoining the Task Group five hours later &quot;Chicago&quot; once again screened the carriers as they launched air strikes against the Tokyo-Nagoya area.

Operations with the carriers, including a diversion to the south to avoid a typhoon, continued until 9 August when Rear Admiral Shafroth&#x27;s bombardment unit returned to Kamaishi. The battleships, joined by &quot;Chicago&quot;, three more heavy cruisers and a Royal Navy light cruiser detachment, delivered another two-hour bombardment of the town before returning to the carrier task forces.

For the next six days, the cruiser screened the carriers as they launched continuous strikes against the Japanese Home Islands, until 15 August and the Japanese armistice. &quot;Chicago&quot; remained with the carriers until 23 August, when she departed for Japan. Anchoring in Sagami Wan on 27 August, and then moving to Tokyo Bay on 3 September, the cruiser supported the unloading of supplies and equipment for Third Fleet occupation forces.

==Post-War==
After transferring 47 men and the Marine Detachment for duty at Yokosuka Naval Base, the cruiser remained in port until 23 October when she got underway for the demilitarization of the Izu Islands. Over the next twelve days, inspection teams helped the Japanese garrison on O Shima and Nii Shima demolish gun emplacements, artillery, ammunition and other military equipment on the islands. Three days later, on 7 November, the cruiser got underway for San Pedro, California.

After arrival on 23 November &quot;Chicago&quot; received an overhaul at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, before returning to the Far East. Underway on 24 January 1946, the cruiser arrived in Shanghai on 18 February for occupation duty. She remained there until 28 March as flagship of the Yangtze Patrol, and then sailed to Sasebo, Japan, where she became flagship of Naval Support Force, Japanese Empire Waters. The cruiser visited several other ports in Japan before clearing for the west coast on 14 January 1947. Moved to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, the heavy cruiser was placed out of commission in reserve on 6 June 1947.

==Rebuilt as missile cruiser==

On 1 November 1958, &quot;Chicago&quot; was reclassified CG-11 and towed to San Francisco Naval Shipyard to begin a five-year conversion to an Albany-class Guided Missile Cruiser. (20 months longer than &quot;Columbus&quot; and 13 months longer than &quot;Albany&quot;) Begun on 1 July 1959, the entire superstructure was removed and replaced with new aluminum compartments, modernized electronic systems, and an improved Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) equipped combat information center. Representative of the new technological focus on guided missiles, &quot;Chicago&quot; was refitted with Tartar and Talos SAM stowage, loading, launching, and guidance systems. Two triple torpedo tubes, an ASROC launcher, two 5 in/38 cal guns, and two antisubmarine helicopters rounded out the cruisers&#x27; modifications.

Designed to provide long-range air, surface, and sub-surface defense for task forces, &quot;Chicago&quot; was recommissioned at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard on 2 May 1964, and was assigned to Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Nine of the US Pacific Fleet. Preliminary acceptance trials were conducted throughout the summer until 2 September, when &quot;Chicago&quot; officially joined the 1st Fleet as an active unit. Following sonar calibration and deperming in Puget Sound the cruiser arrived at her home port of San Diego, California, to begin weapons systems qualifications. Examination and evaluation of the new missile systems were completed by 2 December, following successful trials at the Pacific Missile Range off southern California.

On 4 January 1965, the cruiser shifted to Long Beach, California, to begin a series of shock tests off San Clemente Island. Equipment tests, as well as damage control exercises, were completed by mid-January. &quot;Chicago&quot; then departed the area for San Francisco for alterations, receiving upgraded Tartar missile systems and improved electronics. The warship returned to San Diego on 17 April.

For the next two months, &quot;Chicago&quot; continued shakedown training, engineering, navigation, and seamanship drills as well as missile and electronic exercises. In mid-June, the cruiser began Talos fire control developmental testing with the Naval Electronics Laboratory. This, and later tests, examined guidance improvements and experimented with missile replenishment at sea.

During fleet exercise &quot;Hot Stove&quot; in August–September, &quot;Chicago&quot; practiced anti-air and ASW operations, including firing ASROC and tube-launched torpedoes against submerged &quot;enemy&quot; submarines. Following an ECM exercise &quot;Chicago&quot; participated in a competitive missile firing exercise and won a gold Missilery &quot;E&quot; for her Tartar battery. During the first week of October the warship participated in another anti-air exercise, this time shooting down two high-speed, high-altitude drones with Talos and Tartar missiles.

After a cruise to Hawaii from 19 October to 3 November, during which the cruiser practiced tactical data sharing training with the aircraft carrier and destroyer , the ship finished out the year conducting tests and exercises in the San Diego area. Local operations continued in the spring, including more missile evaluation tests through February 1966. Returning to San Diego on 4 March the ship underwent operational readiness, technical proficiency, boiler, electronics, and nuclear warfare acceptance inspections. In April, the warship participated in Exercise &quot;Gray Ghost,&quot; where the cruiser operated as tactical flagship for the anti-air warfare commander, Rear Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr.

==1st Vietnam deployment==
On 12 May 1966, &quot;Chicago&quot; got underway for her first Vietnam deployment. After stopping at Pearl Harbor and Yokosuka, where a new radar antenna was installed, the ship arrived at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay on 12 June. Picking up her helicopter detachment the cruiser departed the next day for duty with Task Force 77 on Yankee Station in the Tonkin Gulf.

From 15 June to 13 July, &quot;Chicago&quot;, call-sign Red Crown, began evaluating the concept of radar surveillance of all U.S. Navy air operations over designated areas of the Gulf and North Vietnam. Known as PIRAZ, for &quot;positive identification and radar advisory zone&quot;, the initial duties of tracking friendly aircraft was expanded to include Air Force planes, controlling barrier combat air patrols, advising support aircraft, and coordinating strike information with the Air Force reporting center at Da Nang, South Vietnam. On 5 July a Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King search and rescue helicopter operating from &quot;Chicago&quot; rescued an A-4E Skyhawk pilot from who had ejected off the coast of North Vietnam on 4 July. After a port visit to Hong Kong, where the ship had to avoid a typhoon on 17 July.

On her second PIRAZ tour, from 29 July to 11 August, &quot;Chicago&quot; assumed the duties of anti-air warfare commander for short periods of time and demonstrated the ability of a CG to track complex air operations. After a practice Talos missile shot off Okinawa on 27 August, and a short visit to Keelung, Taiwan, the ship returned to PIRAZ station on from 7 September to 29 September. The cruiser, expanding air duties once again, soon became the primary source for MIG warning information, and assumed surveillance responsibility for the North Vietnamese-Chinese border. On her fourth PIRAZ tour, from 25 October to 12 November, the cruiser helped improve these procedures, particularly in the area of joint Air Force-Navy cooperation.

En route to Sasebo, via Subic Bay, the cruiser stopped at the Okinawa Missile Range to fire two more practice missiles on 18 November. Arriving in Japan on 19 November, the ship visited Yokosuka before departing for home on 27 November. Sailing in rough seas, the ship completed the non-stop voyage on 7 December. The cruiser remained at San Diego for the remainder of the year.

Starting in January 1967, the cruiser settled into the busy routine of training, exercises, and inspections. Underway for such widely divergent responsibilities as providing guest cruises for the Secretary of the Navy, serving as First Fleet flagship, and air warfare exercises with USS &quot;Constellation&quot;, the cruiser spent the first five months of the year off California. In both April and May, &quot;Chicago&quot; conducted experimental Talos missile tests against surface targets to demonstrate missile versatility.

Following readiness inspections, the cruiser departed 6 June for an Alaskan cruise with Commander First Fleet. Arriving in Juneau, Alaska, on 10 June, the ship paid an official visit to that city before returning to San Diego eleven days later. After another fleet exercise in July, where &quot;Chicago&quot;″s Talos battery scored a direct hit on a drone at a range of 96 miles, the cruiser spent August conducting official visits to Seattle, Washington, Vancouver, and Esquimalt, British Columbia.

==2nd Vietnam deployment==
Assigned to tender availability on 1 September, the ship received boiler and other repairs and inspections from before departing for another WestPac deployment on 11 October 1967. After departing Pearl Harbor on 18 October, the warship assisted in vectoring aircraft to the site of a Navy F-8 Crusader crash site, successfully rescuing the pilot. Arriving on station in the Gulf of Tonkin three weeks later, via Yokosuka, Okinawa, and Subic Bay, the ship relieved the cruiser , beginning PIRAZ duties from 12 November to 14 December. These responsibilities, improved over the past year, included radar surveillance, coordinating barrier CAP and rescue operations, providing MiG and border warnings, and a wide variety of communication and real-time data sharing services.

After a visit to Hong Kong from 16 to 21 December, the cruiser moved to Subic Bay for an import availability period completed on 3 January 1968. &quot;Chicago&quot; steamed to Singapore, for a short rest period, before returning to the PIRAZ station from 13 January until 28 January, when following the seizure of by North Korea, the cruiser steamed to the Sea of Japan to help coordinate air activities for the carriers of Task Group 70.6 as part of Operation Formation Star. On 7 February, as the crisis eased, &quot;Chicago&quot; departed to resume PIRAZ duties in the Gulf of Tonkin from 12 February to 6 March.

Following a final PIRAZ cruise from 23 March to 17 April, &quot;Chicago&quot; departed Subic Bay on 1 May and arrived in San Diego on 15 May, via Guam and Pearl Harbor. After a brief diversion to the Pacific Missile Range, to conduct experimental aircraft tracking and missile firings, the cruiser entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 1 July for a regular repair period followed by machinery and electronics sea trials and inspections for the remainder of 1968.

==3rd Vietnam deployment==
On 31 January 1969, &quot;Chicago&quot; concluded her missile systems qualifications tests, including a Talos test firing against a missile drone, before departing for her third cruise to the Western Pacific on 13 February. The cruiser underwent ten days of upkeep and type training at Subic Bay before assuming duties as PIRAZ ship on 11 March. Twelve days later, the ship began additional Search and Rescue (SAR) duty in the Gulf. This involved maintaining two helicopters on patrol station to provide rescue coverage for Naval aircraft reconnaissance missions.

On 17 April, &quot;Chicago&quot; was ordered to proceed to the Sea of Japan, off Korea, for duty with Task Force 71. In response to the shooting down of an EC-121 by North Korean fighters on 14 April, that killed all 31 personnel on board, the Task Force patrolled the Sea of Japan during the crisis that followed. The cruiser provided PIRAZ and screening duties for the carriers, and their constant air patrols, until 27 April when the ship departed for upkeep at Sasebo, Japan.

Following repairs, Talos and Tartar missile tests at the Okinawa missile range, and picking up a group of midshipmen at Da Nang on 23 May, &quot;Chicago&quot; conducted another long PIRAZ/SAR tour from 23 May to 1 July. After upkeep at Yokosuka, a visit to Hong Kong, and a typhoon evasion, the cruiser returned to the Gulf of Tonkin on 1 August to continue radar surveillance, electronic countermeasures, and missile screen duties. Departing 25 August, the cruiser returned, via Subic Bay, Guam, and Pearl Harbor, to San Diego on 17 September.

After a leave and upkeep period, followed by a tender availability that installed Zuni chaff dispensers, the cruiser finished out the year conducting routine inspections, local training exercises, and operations at the missile test range. Author T. J. Jackson Lears was a communications officer aboard &quot;Chicago&quot; at this time. &quot;Chicago&quot;, still serving as United States First Fleet flagship for Vice Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr., began the new year quietly, with team training at the Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare school in San Diego. Several fleet exercises, two missile firing tests, and inspections filled the months until 12 June 1970, when the cruiser underwent a two-week repair and alteration period. All four Talos fire control systems were upgraded to include anti-ship targeting and an experimental video target tracker was installed. Communications security, nuclear safety, and operational readiness inspections, as well as final engineering checks, were completed by the end of August.

==4th Vietnam deployment==

Despite cutbacks that had substantially lowered her crew component, the cruiser sailed for Vietnam on 9 September 1970. Arriving on station on 3 October, &quot;Chicago&quot; conducted PIRAZ and search coordination duties with evasive maneuvering to avoid super typhoons Joan and Kate between 14 and 26 October. After a 27 October refueling accident injured several men, &quot;Chicago&quot; left the Gulf of Tonkin on 1 November and Captain Stanley Thomas Counts assumed command before the ship arrived in Yokosuka on 7 November. &quot;Chicago&quot; departed Yokosuka on 17 November and resumed PIRAZ station from 20 November to 19 December. &quot;Chicago&quot; spent Christmas 1970 in Hong Kong and celebrated the new year in Subic Bay. &quot;Chicago&quot; left Subic Bay on 11 January and resumed PIRAZ station until 18 February. &quot;Chicago&quot; departed Subic Bay en route to San Diego on 24 February escorted by the frigate . &quot;Knox&quot; rescued a &quot;Chicago&quot; sailor who jumped overboard on 26 February; he thought it would get him discharged. After refueling in Guam on 27 February, &quot;Knox&quot; suffering a loss of power due to a JP-5 fire in engineering on 3 March. &quot;Chicago&quot; took &quot;Knox&quot; in tow until a fleet tug arrived at the scene from Pearl Harbor on 5 March.

Upon arrival in San Diego on 11 March, the cruiser began a post-deployment leave and upkeep period. Supply replenishment, inspections, and a midshipmen&#x27;s cruise in June and July, were followed by exercises, inspections, and a dependent-guest cruise into October.

==5th Vietnam deployment==

After a final readiness test and embarking five guests of the Secretary of the Navy, Chicago departed for another deployment on 6 November 1971 under the command of Captain Thomas William McNamara. After a weekend stop at Pearl Harbor, where the passengers were debarked, the ship stopped at Guam and Subic Bay before arriving in the Gulf of Tonkin PIRAZ station on 6 December. &quot;Chicago&quot; left PIRAZ station on 28 December to celebrate the new year in Singapore, and briefly crossed the equator on 4 January for a line-crossing ceremony at 105° 30 east. &quot;Chicago&quot; then spent a week in Subic Bay before resuming PIRAZ station from 18 January to 10 February. &quot;Chicago&quot; launched four RIM-8H Talos-ARM anti-radar homing missiles against North Vietnamese shore-based radar stations in February and March, but no hits were registered. After a few days in Subic Bay, radar surveillance and air coordination continued on PIRAZ station from 3 March until leaving on 21 March to visit Hong Kong. The cruiser set course for San Diego before being recalled to PIRAZ station on 3 April 1972 in response to the North Vietnamese Army&#x27;s invasion of the south.

The scale of U.S. air operations increased dramatically as strike and interdiction missions, designed to restrict the movement of men and supplies, were conducted throughout North Vietnam. The cruiser monitored all aircraft flying over the gulf, directed friendly CAP, and, despite intense electronic jamming, coordinated fighter escorts during the mid-April B-52 Stratofortress raids against the North Vietnamese. By maintaining a complete air picture, &quot;Chicago&quot; vectored damaged bombers around enemy missile sites, set up tanker rendezvous points for planes low on fuel, and directed helicopters on rescue operations. The cruiser also directed friendly fighters against North Vietnamese aircraft. In April and May, &quot;Chicago&quot;″s air intercept controllers directed Navy and Air Force aircraft on CAP missions that were credited with 14 MiGs shot down. Among these was the second MiG downed by Navy aces Randy Cunningham and William P. Driscoll.

&quot;Chicago&quot;″s forward Talos battery downed a MiG at long-range during the mining of Hai Phong harbor on 9 May. &quot;Chicago&quot; and the cruiser were given the unusual assignment of protecting A-6 Intruder and A-7 Corsair aircraft mining Hai Phong harbor at low altitude during Operation Pocket Money. To avoid exposing F-4 Phantom fighters to North Vietnamese ground-based anti-aircraft defenses, these ships patrolling offshore were given a free-fire zone for Talos missiles to engage defending MiG fighters approaching the coast from Phúc Yên and Kép airfields near Hanoi. &quot;Chicago&quot; came under fire from North Vietnamese coastal artillery batteries, but was able to maintain missile envelope coverage while moving out of gun range before suffering any damage. After a month of surveillance and directing air strikes against Hai Phong harbor traffic, &quot;Chicago&quot; finally departed for San Diego on 21 June 1972.

==Post-Vietnam==

Arriving home on 8 July, the ship underwent a local availability before entering Long Beach Naval Shipyard on 25 August for a Complex Overhaul. During this refit, &quot;Chicago&quot; received new digital fire control systems, replacing the old analog computers, installed new missile launchers, and expanded her electronics equipment.

On 15 May 1973, &quot;Chicago&quot; began carrying out six months of sea trials, tests, and training evolutions. New equipment and combat coordination procedures were also implemented, extending the cruiser&#x27;s operational readiness date to 14 December. Finally, after refresher training, fleet exercises, and weapons load-out, the cruiser departed for another WestPac deployment on 21 May 1974. After arrival at Subic Bay on 15 June, the ship prepared for an extended cruise with the frigate , destroyer , and auxiliary vessel . Designed to counter the Soviet Navy&#x27;s presence in Somalia and Aden on the Indian Ocean, the low-key port visits were intended to demonstrate that &quot;the Indian Ocean is not a Russian lake&quot;.

Departing Subic Bay on 25 June, the squadron passed through the Straits of Malacca on 2 July and arrived at Karachi, Pakistan six days later. Underway on 13 July, &quot;Chicago&quot; and her escorts began a monthlong at-sea period, &quot;showing the flag&quot; in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden, before arriving at Mombassa, Kenya on 9 August. A week later, in an effort to influence Russian negotiations for basing rights in the Mauritius Islands, the squadron conducted a diplomatic port visit to Port Louis. Toward this end, &quot;Chicago&quot; embarked several Mauritian government officials on 21 August for a two-day cruise to Rodrigues Island. Departing on 23 August, the ships returned to Subic Bay, via Singapore, for upkeep on 11 September.

Following a visit to Hong Kong in early October, the cruiser spent the next month conducting training and fleet exercises in the Philippines area until getting underway for Guam on 17 November. After a week at Apra Harbor, the ship departed on 29 November for San Diego. Arriving home on 14 December, the ship remained in port for leave, repairs, and upkeep into March 1975. Technical inspections and equipment modifications, interspersed with a visit by a delegation of French officials, lasted until April when the ship conducted interim refresher training in the southern California operating areas.

Following a series of missile tests in late May, and fleet exercises with Pacific naval units, the cruiser visited Seattle for the Fourth of July celebrations. After a visit to Vancouver the following week, &quot;Chicago&quot; returned to San Diego to begin overhaul preparations. From 9 September to 24 October, the cruiser underwent a major restricted availability as repairs were conducted to fuel tanks, boiler casings, and the main propulsion plant. Additional upkeep, tender availability, and type training continued through the new year as the cruiser prepared for another deployment. In February 1976, personnel in the Operations department underwent extensive team training in anti-air, anti-submarine, and electronic warfare in preparation for a fleet exercise in March. That operation, exercise &quot;Valiant Heritage&quot;, took place from 2–11 March with forces from Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and the United States.

Following a month in port, and several service inspections, &quot;Chicago&quot; left San Diego on 13 April to deploy to the Western Pacific. Sailing with an amphibious group the cruiser conducted multi-ship exercises, both before and after Pearl Harbor, and arrived at Yokosuka on 3 May. Task group exercises with the aircraft carrier , &quot;Multiplex 2-76&quot; from 19 to 25 May and &quot;Multiplex 3-76&quot; in the South China Sea from 4–7 June, and port visits to Subic Bay and Keelung, occupied &quot;Chicago&quot; through June. After a midshipmen cruise from Yokosuka to the Philippines in early July, the cruiser began an import period lasting until 2 August.

On 4 August, the cruiser participated in &quot;Multiplex 1-7T&quot;, followed by a successful missile firing exercise off Poro Point, Luzon on 7 August. Returning to Subic Bay for two weeks of upkeep, the cruiser sailed for Hong Kong on 22 August. Arriving three days later, after avoiding a third typhoon, the ship spent six days in that liberty port. Leaving Hong Kong on 31 August, &quot;Chicago&quot; joined rendezvous with for a war-at-sea exercise lasting until 8 September, before returning to Subic for a lengthy upkeep period. Repainting the exterior, and interior improvements lasted until 27 September, when the cruiser got underway for home. Stopping at Guam on 1 October to refuel, and Pearl Harbor on 9 October for a dependents cruise, the ship finally returned to San Diego on 16 October.
The cruiser remained in port, receiving boiler repairs and equipment upgrades, until 23 February when the ship began post-repair sea trials and crew training. Following inspections, and ordnance loadout at Seal Beach on 3 March, &quot;Chicago&quot; began a regular schedule of training operations out of San Diego. These exercises, including helicopter pad training, simulated missile and torpedo attacks, and other similar drills, continued until 6 September, when the ship got underway for her eighth WestPac tour.

Chicago arrived in Subic Bay on 30 September, after multi-ship exercises that included four missile shots while underway, to begin a series of operations with the 7th Fleet. Missile shots and convoy exercises off Mindoro, a barrier exercise off Buckner Bay, and visits to Yokosuka, Keelung, and Hong Kong lasted until late November. On 4 December, after a rendezvous with &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;, the cruiser began operations in the Sea of Japan. Helicopter and underway replenishments were interrupted two days later, when the formation was circled by two Soviet Tupolev Tu-16 &quot;Badgers&quot;, but exercises continued until 8 December. Departing the area, &quot;Chicago&quot; steamed south to Subic Bay, for sonar exercises with the submarine , arriving at Singapore on 23 December. After the holidays, the cruiser moved to Phattaya Bay, Thailand on 30 December.

Departing 4 January 1978, the cruiser visited Subic Bay and Hong Kong before starting a month of exercises in the Philippine Sea. Gunfire exercises, helicopter operations, unreps, and other drills, including a real man overboard rescue on 28 February, lasted until 4 March, when &quot;Chicago&quot; moored at Manila. After repairs and upkeep, the ship steamed for Guam on 16 March, arriving five days later to refuel, before arriving in Pearl Harbor on 31 March.

After returning to San Diego on 7 April, the ship remained in upkeep status until 24 July 1978, when the cruiser moved to Long Beach to start a regular overhaul. Repairs at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard lasted until 18 October, when the cruiser conducted two days of sea trials. Finishing work continued until 25 October, when Chicago departed the shipyard. After two days of operations with the destroyer and submarine , the cruiser moved back to San Diego to begin a regular schedule of training exercises. These short cruises, concentrating on gunnery and underway training, lasted through February 1979. A number of propulsion and electronic service inspections were also conducted. On 5 March, during exercises off southern California, the cruiser also earned her eleventh consecutive Missile &quot;E&quot;.
After a monthlong pre-deployment period, the ship departed on 30 May for her final cruise to the Western Pacific. &quot;Chicago&quot; escorted the aircraft carrier and her battle group to Pearl Harbor, conducting exercises with the cruiser , frigate , and auxiliary vessel along the way, before steaming on to Subic Bay on 13 June. Fleet exercises off Okinawa, and a port visit to Pusan, South Korea, at the end of July, were followed by refugee surveillance in the South China Sea. There, along with other 7th Fleet ships, she helped rescue Vietnamese refugees fleeing the mainland, picking up five herself.

Escort duties for &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; continued through September when, on 6 October, she sailed for Australia. On 15 October, after memorial services for two cruisers lost in the Solomon Islands battles during World War II, and the earlier , the cruiser began two weeks of exercises in the Coral Sea. After the exercise, involving seven U.S. ships and twenty Australian and New Zealand vessels, the ship visited Sydney, Australia, for a week-long port visit, then departed for the west coast via Subic Bay and Pearl Harbor, and arrived at San Diego on 17 December.

While fiscal year 1980 funding for a thorough overhaul and modernization was approved by Congress, an inspection classified the cruiser as unfit for further economical naval service, and on 1 March 1980, &quot;Chicago&quot; was decommissioned at San Diego. Towed to the Inactive Ship Facility at Bremerton, Washington, the ship was held in reserve until 8 February 1989. Stripped of equipment by 11 August, the hulk was sold for scrap to Southwest Recycling, Inc., Terminal Island, California, on 9 December 1991. The anchor was saved and placed on display at Chicago&#x27;s Navy Pier on 11 November 1995.

<text>James Laverne &quot;Skeeter&quot; Webb (November 4, 1909 – July 8, 1986) was an American professional baseball infielder in Major League Baseball from 1932 to 1949. He played 12 seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Philadelphia Athletics.

==Early years==

He compiled a career-high .320 batting average in 472 at bats with Cedar Rapids in 1935.

===Cleveland Indians===
In April 1938, he signed as a free agent with the Cleveland Indians. In 1939, he played in 81 games at shortstop for the Indians and had a .264 batting average, the highest of his major-league career. He also appeared in 39 games with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League in 1939.

===Chicago White Sox===
Traded to the Chicago White Sox in January 1940, he was moved to second base, where he played 74 games. His batting average dropped to .237 in 1940, and he was relegated to the role of a utility infielder and back-up second baseman in 1942 and 1943. However, with the major-league talent pool depleted, Webb won the job as the Sox&#x27; starting shortstop in 1944. However, he hit only .211 in 513 at bats for the 1944 White Sox.

===Detroit Tigers===
Traded to the Detroit Tigers at the end of the 1944 season, Webb was the Tigers&#x27; starting shortstop in their 1945 World Series championship season. Skeeter played 104 games at shortstop for the 1945 Tigers, but proved to be a liability at bat. His batting average dropped to .199 in 1945, as Webb got only 81 hits in 407 at bats.

Despite his weak hitting performance in the regular season, Webb played all seven games of the 1945 World Series as the Tigers&#x27; shortstop. He hit .185 in the World Series, going 5-for-27, though he did score five runs. In game 7, Webb had his best performance, scoring two runs and fielding the final out of the series. After the Series, one sports writer singled out Webb for the following praise: &quot;During the regular season, Webb was not a standout performer with the Tigers. He was a fair fielder but a weak hitter. No one who has followed the Tigers closely this year would have been surprised if Webb had buckled under the strain of World Series competition. However, instead of buckling, Webb played better than any infielder on either club. He made a number of dazzling plays and not a single error. In addition, he hit the ball harder and with more effectiveness than he ever did during the American League campaign.&quot;

In 1946 and 1947, Webb stayed with the Tigers as a backup second baseman.

===Philadelphia Athletics===
He finished his major league career playing in 23 games for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1948, where he hit a career-low .148. He played in his final game on August 31, 1948.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
During the 1949 season, Webb played for the Toronto Maple Leafs in the International League. He appeared in 49 games for Toronto.

===Career totals===
In 12 major league seasons, Webb played in 699 games - 368 at shortstop, 282 at second base, and seven at third base. Webb had a career .219 batting average, a .263 on-base percentage, and a .368 slugging percentage.

==Later years==
After retiring from baseball, Webb returned to Mississippi. He was married to the former Olive O&#x27;Neill, whose father, Steve, was the manager of the Tigers from 1943 to 1948. The Webbs had two sons (John and James Jr.) and two daughters (Carol Ann and Pam). Skeeter Webb died in Meridian, Mississippi, in 1986.

<text>The Premier League Manager of the Month is an association football award that recognises the best adjudged Premier League manager each month of the season. The winner is chosen by a combination of an online public vote, which contributes to 10% of the final tally, and a panel of experts. It has been called the Carling Premiership Manager of the Month (1993–2001) and the Barclaycard Premiership Manager of the Month (2001–2004); it is currently known as the [[Barclays]] Manager of the Month.

The Premier League was formed in 1992, when the members of the First Division resigned from the Football League. These clubs set up a new commercially independent league that negotiated its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The Premier League introduced new Manager of the Month and Manager of the Season awards for the 1993–94 season, supplementing the existing Football Writers&#x27; Association and Professional Footballers&#x27; Association Player of the Year awards. The first Manager of the Month was awarded to Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson for his achievements in August 1993. For the 1994–95 season, the Premier League introduced the Player of the Month award, which is presented alongside the Manager of the Month award.

Ferguson has been Manager of the Month the most times with a record 27 awards. Harry Redknapp has had six spells managing Premier League clubs (West Ham United, Portsmouth, Southampton, Portsmouth again, Tottenham Hotspur, and Queens Park Rangers), winning a Manager of the Month award in five of those spells. Sixteen other managers have won an award with two or more clubs: Gordon Strachan with Coventry City and Southampton, Stuart Pearce with Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, Martin O&#x27;Neill with Leicester City, Aston Villa, and Sunderland, Roy Hodgson with Blackburn Rovers and Fulham, Rafael Benítez with Liverpool, Chelsea, and Newcastle United, Brendan Rodgers with Swansea City and Liverpool, Alan Pardew with West Ham United and Newcastle United, Sam Allardyce with Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United, Tony Pulis with Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion, Mauricio Pochettino with Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur, Claudio Ranieri with Chelsea and Leicester City, Carlo Ancelotti with Chelsea and Everton, José Mourinho with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, Nuno Espírito Santo with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Tottenham Hotspur, and Nottingham Forest, Eddie Howe with Bournemouth and Newcastle United, and Sean Dyche with Burnley and Everton.

The award has been won in consecutive months by 17 managers: Joe Kinnear, Kevin Keegan, Roy Evans, Alex Ferguson, Arsène Wenger, David O&#x27;Leary, Stuart Pearce, Paul Jewell, Rafael Benítez, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini, Claudio Ranieri, Antonio Conte, Pep Guardiola, Jürgen Klopp, Mikel Arteta, and Ange Postecoglou. Guardiola is the only manager in Premier League history to have won the award in four successive months. Klopp is the first manager to win the award five times in a season. Postecoglou is the only manager to win the award in each of his first three months in the competition. The award has been shared on one occasion, in March 2002, when Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier was jointly awarded Manager of the Month with caretaker manager Phil Thompson, who had deputised while Houllier was absent for medical reasons.

, the most recent recipient of the award is Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola.

<doc id="557868" wikidata="Q6989062" url="?curid=557868" title="Neil Morrissey">
<text>Neil Anthony Morrissey (born 4 July 1962) is an English actor, businessman, narrator and presenter. He is known for his role as Tony in &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot;. Other notable acting roles include Deputy Head Eddie Lawson in the BBC One school-based drama series &quot;Waterloo Road&quot;, Nigel Morton in &quot;Line of Duty&quot;, and Rocky in &quot;Boon&quot;. Morrissey also provided the voice of the titular character, Lofty, Roley, and others in &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;.

==Early life==
Morrissey was born in Stafford, Staffordshire on 4 July 1962, the third of four sons of Irish parents who were both psychiatric nurses. He and his older brother Stephen spent much of their childhood in separate children&#x27;s homes, Morrissey spending most of his time at Penkhull Children&#x27;s Home, under the care of Margaret Cartlidge.

He attended Thistley Hough High School in Penkhull, where he passed all nine CSEs with O-Level-equivalent grades, despite purportedly being downgraded from taking GCE exams on account of his being raised in care. He went on to further study for his A-levels at the City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College. 
Morrissey had developed his skills and reputation as an actor through his teenage years at Stoke Schools Theatre, Stoke Repertory Theatre, performing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1979. He further studied acting at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, after receiving an educational grant, and he &#x27;sofa-surfed&#x27; with friends, and performed street theatre, to survive first year.

==Career==
===Acting===
In 1984, Morrissey, in his film debut, played Able Seaman Matthew Quintal in historical mariner drama &quot;The Bounty&quot;, alongside Mel Gibson, Anthony Hopkins and Laurence Olivier. In 1987, Morrissey rose to notoriety as dim biker Rocky in the ITV drama series &quot;Boon&quot;, alongside Michael Elphick. Many of the actors from &quot;Boon&quot;, were also involved in the 1990 British spoof horror film &quot;I Bought a Vampire Motorcycle&quot;, where he played the lead role of Noddy. In 1992, Morrissey took on the role of Tony in &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot;, created to replace Harry Enfield, who departed after series one. The series became one of the most popular UK sitcoms of the 90s and Morrissey became a national celebrity. 

During the early 1990s he appeared as &quot;Sammy the Chamois&quot; in Noel Edmonds&#x27; &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;.

In 1998, Morrissey starred in the John Godber rugby league film &quot;Up &#x27;n&#x27; Under&quot;. Neil also voiced Wilfred Toadflax and Dusty Dogwood in &quot;Brambly Hedge&quot; (1997), which was produced by HIT Entertainment.

The part of Blood was played by Aidan McArdle, Al Murray played King Charles II, and the cast also included Mel Giedroyc.

===Spoof show===
On 1 April 2006, a BBC Three spoof programme titled &quot;Neil Morrissey&#x27;s Secret&quot; documented sides of Morrissey&#x27;s life that were previously unknown to the world at large. It alleged he has a house, wife and two children in Jordan, as well as a degree in botany, for which he had studied for 20 years. These studies were integral to his motivation to find a breakthrough in anti-ageing, which supposedly occurred naturally amongst the local population. It was said that he had invented a cream called The Essence which contains extracts of a plant found only in a remote Jordanian village. In the documentary the cream&#x27;s acolytes include celebrities such as Jane Seymour, Gloria Hunniford and Philippa Forrester. The hoax documentary was launched on 1 April, and despite the suspicions caused by this date as April Fool&#x27;s Day, it still managed to convince some people that it was true.

===Business===
Morrissey&#x27;s love of Welsh poet Dylan Thomas led him to buy up numerous properties in the village of Laugharne, including the Hurst Hotel, the New Three Mariners pub and Brown&#x27;s Hotel in April 2004 for £670,000. In October 2006, it was announced that the business had put Brown&#x27;s Hotel on the market to finance the redevelopment of the Hurst Hotel, and the expansion of the private members&#x27; club, Hurst House in Covent Garden, London.

In July 2008, with delays encountered on the construction of Hurst House-at-the-Mill, a luxury hotel in Hertfordshire due to open in 2009, the Laugharne-based assets of the Hurst House group went into a packaged administration. The assets were subsequently bought by new investors, resulting in the end of Morrissey&#x27;s association with Laugharne.

Morrissey part-owned the lease on the &quot;Ye Olde Punch Bowl Inn&quot; in Marton, North Yorkshire. From this base came the Morrissey Fox range of real ale, developed by Morrissey and chef Richard Fox which is still in production. In June 2009, it was reported that his Welsh pub had failed and the lease to &quot;Ye Olde Punch Bowl Inn&quot; was handed back to the owner after just 18 months on 22 October 2009.

Morrissey avoided bankruptcy over his failed business ventures but entered an IVA. Morrissey went on to own a chain of pubs in Staffordshire, including &quot;The Plume of Feathers&quot; in Barlaston, and later &quot;The Old Bramshall Inn&quot; in Bramshall. The latter opened its doors as a Neil Morrissey pub on 28 June 2018, an event which Morrissey attended. In December 2021 the leasehold was sold and the pub was renamed &#x27;The Butchers Arms&#x27;.

==Personal life==
Morrissey married Amanda Noar in 1987 after meeting her when she was a guest in an episode of &quot;Boon&quot;; the couple have a son born in 1989. They divorced in 1991. He then became engaged to actress Elizabeth Carling, whom he had first met in 1989, when she too was working on &quot;Boon&quot;. They parted on good terms, and she later guest-starred alongside him in &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot;. His subsequent affairs have been well documented by the British tabloids, including dating Rachel Weisz after starring together in &quot;My Summer with Des&quot; in 1998. They lived together at his flat in Crouch End, north London. Morrissey had an affair with Amanda Holden in 2000, whom he met filming &quot;Happy Birthday, Shakespeare&quot;, leading to her divorce in 2003 from comedian Les Dennis.

Morrissey&#x27;s older brother Stephen died in 1997 following a drug overdose. Morrissey has numerous tattoos. According to one version of their origin, he applied them himself with needles and Indian ink. On his left arm are his first name and a blob, which was going to be his initials before it became infected, causing him to require a tetanus jab. On his right is a squiggle, which is a reversed version of &quot;The Saint&quot; logo. Morrissey himself says the tattoos were done by other boys at the children&#x27;s home. The boys there apparently saw that he did not have a tattoo and so gave him the option of a tattoo or a beating. He decided on the tattoo and now regrets not taking the other option.

In 2006, Morrissey was awarded an honorary degree from Staffordshire University. He is a supporter of Crystal Palace. A fan of real ale, in 2011 he produced a real ale with the club called Palace Ale.

<text>Sir Charles Bagot, (23 September 1781 – 19 May 1843) was a British politician, diplomat and colonial administrator. He served as ambassador to the United States, Russia, and the Netherlands. He served as the second Governor General of the Province of Canada from 1841 to 1843.

==Early life and family==

Bagot was the second son of William Bagot, 1st Baron Bagot, of Blithfield Hall, Staffordshire, and the Hon. Elizabeth Louisa St. John, daughter of Viscount St. John, of Lydiard Park, Wiltshire. He was educated at Rugby School and Christ Church, Oxford. He entered Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, where he studied law, but left and returned to Oxford to complete his master&#x27;s degree.

His marriage to the wealthy Lady Mary Charlotte Anne Wellesley-Pole, the niece of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, and other Bagot family connections made possible his subsequent diplomatic career.

=== Member of Parliament ===
Bagot served as Member of Parliament for Castle Rising from 1807 to 1808, alongside Richard Sharp.

==Diplomatic career==

===Ambassador to United States===
He was named minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinaire to the United States on 31 July 1815, in the aftermath of the War of 1812. With Richard Rush, he negotiated the Rush–Bagot Treaty to limit naval forces on the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain. He also contributed to negotiations leading to the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which defined the border between British North America and the United States from Lake of the Woods (see Northwest Angle) to the Pacific Ocean. Bagot ended his term in Washington, D.C. in 1820.

===Ambassador to Russia, Netherlands===
He subsequently served as British Ambassador to Russia, where he took part in negotiations leading to the 1825 Treaty of Saint Petersburg.

Then, he served as British Ambassador to the Netherlands, where he was involved in negotiations leading to the establishment of Belgium in 1831.

==Governor General of the Province of Canada==
After a hiatus of ten years from diplomatic service, Bagot agreed to succeed Lord Sydenham as governor general of the newly proclaimed Province of Canada. He was chosen because of his diplomatic knowledge of the United States. Bagot was appointed 27 September 1841, and arrived in the Canadian capital Kingston on 10 January 1842, taking office two days later.

===Political administration===
Bagot was ordered by the British government to resist the strengthening demands for responsible government. As an important concession, however, Bagot did allow the leading Canadian colonial politicians Robert Baldwin and Sir Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine to form a ministry, on the basis of their parliamentary majority. Lafontaine, as a French-Canadian leader, had suffered abusive treatment by the British under the previous governor general, Lord Sydenham, who had died in office in 1841. This was the beginning of what became known as &quot;representative government&quot; in Canada. Bagot&#x27;s leadership was an important step forward in establishing more amicable relations between the colonizing British and French.

Bagot worked productively with Baldwin and Lafontaine to establish a structure for fair municipal governance in the province of Canada. Their work has stood the test of time. With the arrival of Confederation in 1867, a well-defined system of three-tiered governance—federal, provincial, and municipal—came into being in Ontario and Quebec.

===Extradition of fugitive slave===
While serving as governor-general, Bagot ordered the first criminal extradition of a fugitive slave to the United States from Canada West. The fugitive in question, Nelson Hacket (or Hackett), had been valet and butler to a wealthy Arkansas slave owner. In 1841, Hacket allegedly stole a beaver overcoat and a racing mare from his master, as well as a gold watch and a saddle from two others, and fled to Canada West. Hacket&#x27;s master caught up with him in Chatham, Ontario, and Hacket was jailed. Governor-General Bagot ruled Hacket had committed a crime by stealing items not necessary for his escape, and for this reason he was extradited. The public in Canada West, as well as abolitionists in the U.S. and Canada, were dismayed, and their displeasure led to a formal treaty, which codified rules for extradition, but upset fugitives, abolitionists, and slave owners.

===Indigenous schools===
In 1842 Bagot initiated a major review of government policies and expenditures related to Indigenous peoples in Canada East and Canada West, appointing Rawson W. Rawson, John Davidson and William Hepburn as report commissioners. Completed in 1844, the final report, titled the &quot;Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada&quot;, included a call for the introduction of industrial schools to address the noted failure of day schools to effectively keep Indigenous children from the influence of their parents and is regarded as a foundational document in the rationale for establishing the Canadian Indian residential school system.

===University administrator===
He served as Chancellor of King&#x27;s College, (now the University of Toronto), 1842–1843.

==Death==
Having resigned his governor general&#x27;s office in January 1843, Bagot died four months later at the vice-regal residence, Alwington House, Alwington, Kingston, too ill to return to the United Kingdom. Bagot&#x27;s library was sold at auction by Messrs Evans in London on 20 June 1844 (and two following days); a copy of the catalogue (which contained Audubon&#x27;s Birds of America) is at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.149(10)).

===Legacy===
Today, he is chiefly remembered for his role in developing the Residential school system, his contributions to the development of the &quot;undefended border&quot; between the United States and Canada, and for fostering more cooperative and positive political relations between the two main colonial groups of British and French settlers.

Bagot Street, a main thoroughfare in downtown Kingston, is named in his memory.

Mount Bagot, a mountain on the Canada-US border, is named in his honor.

==Family==
Bagot married Lady Mary Charlotte Anne Wellesley, daughter of William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington on 22 July 1806. Together they had:

# Colonel Charles Bagot (1808 - 1881) m. Sophia Percy, granddaughter of Algernon Percy, 1st Earl of Beverley
#Emily Georgiana Bagot (1809 -1848) m. George Finch-Hatton, 10th Earl of Winchilsea
# Henrietta Maria Bagot (1815 - 1844) m. Henry Paget, 2nd Marquess of Anglesey
# Georgiana Augusta Bagot (1818 - 1851)
# George Talbot Bagot (1820 - 1907) m. Charlotte Blair, daughter of 
# Colonel Alexander Bagot (1822 - 1874) m. Gertrude Letitia Hallifax
# Wilhelmina Frederica Bagot (1826 - 1852) m. Henry Bagot, son of her uncle, Richard Bagot (bishop)

The family accompanied their parents to Canada, on Bagot&#x27;s appointment as Governor-General of British North America on 12 January 1842. After her husband&#x27;s death at Kingston, on 18 May 1843, she accompanied his remains to England. She died in London on 2 February 1845.

<doc id="557896" wikidata="Q7234817" url="?curid=557896" title="Potential evapotranspiration">
<text>Potential evapotranspiration (PET) or potential evaporation (PE) is the amount of water that would be evaporated and transpired by a specific crop, soil or ecosystem if there was sufficient water available. It is a reflection of the energy available to evaporate or transpire water, and of the wind available to transport the water vapor from the ground up into the lower atmosphere and away from the initial location. Potential evapotranspiration is expressed in terms of a depth of water or soil moisture percentage.

If the actual evapotranspiration is considered the net result of atmospheric demand for moisture from a surface and the ability of the surface to supply moisture, then PET is a measure of the demand side (also called &quot;evaporative demand&quot;). Surface and air temperatures, insolation, and wind all affect this. A dryland is a place where annual potential evaporation exceeds annual precipitation.

Often a value for the potential evapotranspiration is calculated at a nearby climatic station on a reference surface, conventionally on land dominated by short grass (though this may differ from station to station). This value is called the reference evapotranspiration (ET0). Actual evapotranspiration is said to equal potential evapotranspiration when there is ample water present. Evapotranspiration can never be greater than potential evapotranspiration, but can be lower if there is not enough water to be evaporated or plants are unable to transpire maturely and readily. Some US states utilize a full cover alfalfa reference crop that is in height, rather than the general short green grass reference, due to the higher value of ET from the alfalfa reference. 

Potential evapotranspiration is higher in the summer, on clearer and less cloudy days, and closer to the equator, because of the higher levels of solar radiation that provides the energy (heat) for evaporation. Potential evapotranspiration is also higher on windy days because the evaporated moisture can be quickly moved from the ground or plant surface before it precipitates, allowing more evaporation to fill its place.

== Measurements ==
Potential evapotranspiration is usually measured indirectly, from other climatic factors, but also depends on the surface type, such as free water (for lakes and oceans), the soil type for bare soil, and also the density and diversity of vegetation. Often a value for the potential evapotranspiration is calculated at a nearby climate station on a reference surface, conventionally on short grass. This value is called the reference evapotranspiration, and can be converted to a potential evapotranspiration by multiplying by a surface coefficient. In agriculture, this is called a crop coefficient. The difference between potential evapotranspiration and actual precipitation is used in irrigation scheduling.

Average annual potential evapotranspiration is often compared to average annual precipitation, the symbol for which is &quot;P&quot;. The ratio of the two, &quot;P&quot;/&quot;PET&quot;, is the aridity index. A humid subtropical climate is a zone of climate with hot and humid summers, and cold to mild winters. Subarctic regions, between 50°N and 70°N latitude, have short, mild summers and freezing winters depending on local climates. Precipitation and evapotranspiration is low (compared to warmer variants), and vegetation is characteristic of the coniferous/taiga forest.
== Estimates of potential evaporation ==

=== Thornthwaite equation (1948) ===
formula_1

Where

formula_2 is the estimated potential evapotranspiration (mm/month)

formula_3 is the average daily temperature (degrees Celsius; if this is negative, use formula_4) of the month being calculated

formula_5 is the number of days in the month being calculated

formula_6 is the average day length (hours) of the month being calculated

formula_7

formula_8 is a heat index which depends on the 12 monthly mean temperatures formula_9.

Somewhat modified forms of this equation appear in later publications (1955 and 1957) by C. W. Thornthwaite and Mather.

=== Penman equation (1948) ===
The Penman equation describes evaporation (E) from an open water surface, and was developed by Howard Penman in 1948. Penman&#x27;s equation requires daily mean temperature, wind speed, air pressure, and solar radiation to predict E. Simpler Hydrometeorological equations continue to be used where obtaining such data is impractical, to give comparable results within specific contexts, e.g. humid vs arid climates.

=== FAO 56 Penman–Monteith equation (1998) ===
The Penman–Monteith equation refines weather based evapotranspiration (ET) estimates of vegetated land areas. This equation was then derived by FAO for retrieving the potential evapotranspiration ET0. It is widely regarded as one of the most accurate models, in terms of estimates.

:formula_10

:&quot;ET&quot;0 = Potential evapotranspiration, Water volume evapotranspired (mm day−1)
:Δ = Rate of change of saturation specific humidity with air temperature. (Pa K−1)
:&quot;R&quot;n = Net irradiance (MJ m−2 day−1), the external source of energy flux
:&quot;G&quot; = Ground heat flux (MJ m−2 day−1), usually equivalent to zero on a day
:&quot;T&quot; = Air temperature at 2m height (K)
:&quot;u2&quot; = Wind speed at 2m height (m s−1)
:δ&quot;e&quot; = Vapor pressure deficit (kPa)
:&quot;γ&quot; = Psychrometric constant (&quot;γ&quot; ≈ 66 Pa K−1)

N.B.: The coefficients 0.408 and 900 are not unitless but account for the conversion from energy values to equivalent water depths: radiation [mm day−1] = 0.408 radiation [MJ m−2 day−1].

=== Priestley–Taylor equation ===
The Priestley–Taylor equation was developed as a substitute to the Penman–Monteith equation to remove dependence on observations. For Priestley–Taylor, only radiation (irradiance) observations are required. This is done by removing the aerodynamic terms from the Penman–Monteith equation and adding an empirically derived constant factor, formula_11.

The underlying concept behind the Priestley–Taylor model is that an air mass moving above a vegetated area with abundant water would become saturated with water. In these conditions, the actual evapotranspiration would match the Penman rate of potential evapotranspiration. However, observations revealed that actual evaporation was 1.26 times greater than potential evaporation, and therefore the equation for actual evaporation was found by taking potential evapotranspiration and multiplying it by formula_11. The assumption here is for vegetation with an abundant water supply (i.e. the plants have low moisture stress). Areas like arid regions with high moisture stress are estimated to have higher formula_11 values.

The assumption that an air mass moving over a vegetated surface with abundant water saturates has been questioned later. The lowest and turbulent part of the atmosphere, the atmospheric boundary layer, is not a closed box, but constantly brings in dry air from higher up in the atmosphere towards the surface. As water evaporates more easily into a dry atmosphere, evapotranspiration is enhanced. This explains the larger than unity value of the Priestley-Taylor parameter formula_11. The proper equilibrium of the system has been derived and involves the characteristics of the interface of the atmospheric boundary layer and the overlying free atmosphere.

<doc id="557912" wikidata="Q3022317" url="?curid=557912" title="Dendral">
<text>Dendral was a project in artificial intelligence (AI) of the 1960s, and the computer software expert system that it produced. Its primary aim was to study hypothesis formation and discovery in science. For that, a specific task in science was chosen: help organic chemists in identifying unknown organic molecules, by analyzing their mass spectra and using knowledge of chemistry. It was done at Stanford University by Edward Feigenbaum, Bruce G. Buchanan, Joshua Lederberg, and Carl Djerassi, along with a team of highly creative research associates and students. It began in 1965 and spans approximately half the history of AI research.

The software program Dendral is considered the first expert system because it automated the decision-making process and problem-solving behavior of organic chemists. The project consisted of research on two main programs Heuristic Dendral and Meta-Dendral, and several sub-programs. It was written in the Lisp programming language, which was considered the language of AI because of its flexibility.

Many systems were derived from Dendral, including MYCIN, MOLGEN, PROSPECTOR, XCON, and STEAMER. There are many other programs today for solving the mass spectrometry inverse problem, see List of mass spectrometry software, but they are no longer described as &#x27;artificial intelligence&#x27;, just as structure searchers.

The name &quot;Dendral&quot; is an acronym of the term &quot;Dendritic Algorithm&quot;.

==Heuristic Dendral==
Heuristic Dendral is a program that uses mass spectra or other experimental data together with a knowledge base of chemistry to produce a set of possible chemical structures that may be responsible for producing the data. A mass spectrum of a compound is produced by a mass spectrometer, and is used to determine its molecular weight, the sum of the masses of its atomic constituents. For example, the compound water (H2O), has a molecular weight of 18 since hydrogen has a mass of 1.01 and oxygen 16.00, and its mass spectrum has a peak at 18 units. Heuristic Dendral would use this input mass and the knowledge of atomic mass numbers and valence rules, to determine the possible combinations of atomic constituents whose mass would add up to 18. As the weight increases and the molecules become more complex, the number of possible compounds increases drastically. Thus, a program that is able to reduce this number of candidate solutions through the process of hypothesis formation is essential.

New graph-theoretic algorithms were invented by Lederberg, Harold Brown, and others that generate all graphs with a specified set of nodes and connection-types (chemical atoms and bonds) -- with or without cycles. Moreover, the team was able to prove mathematically that the generator is complete, in that it produces all graphs with the specified nodes and edges, and that it is non-redundant, in that the output contains no equivalent graphs (e.g., mirror images). The CONGEN program, as it became known, was developed largely by computational chemists Ray Carhart, Jim Nourse, and Dennis Smith. It was useful to chemists as a stand-alone program to generate chemical graphs showing a complete list of structures that satisfy the constraints specified by a user.

==Meta-Dendral==
Meta-Dendral is a machine learning system that receives the set of possible chemical structures and corresponding mass spectra as input, and proposes a set of rules of mass spectrometry that correlate structural features with processes that produce the mass spectrum. These rules would be fed back to Heuristic Dendral (in the planning and testing programs described below) to test their applicability. Thus, &quot;Heuristic Dendral is a performance system and Meta-Dendral is a learning system&quot;. The program is based on two important features: the plan-generate-test paradigm and knowledge engineering.

===Plan-generate-test paradigm===
The plan-generate-test paradigm is the basic organization of the problem-solving method, and is a common paradigm used by both Heuristic Dendral and Meta-Dendral systems. The generator (later named CONGEN) generates potential solutions for a particular problem, which are then expressed as chemical graphs in Dendral. However, this is feasible only when the number of candidate solutions is minimal. When there are large numbers of possible solutions, Dendral has to find a way to put constraints that rules out large sets of candidate solutions. This is the primary aim of Dendral planner, which is a “hypothesis-formation” program that employs “task-specific knowledge to find constraints for the generator”. Last but not least, the tester analyzes each proposed candidate solution and discards those that fail to fulfill certain criteria. This mechanism of plan-generate-test paradigm is what holds Dendral together.

===Knowledge Engineering===
The primary aim of knowledge engineering is to attain a productive interaction between the available knowledge base and problem solving techniques. This is possible through development of a procedure in which large amounts of task-specific information is encoded into heuristic programs. Thus, the first essential component of knowledge engineering is a large “knowledge base.” Dendral has specific knowledge about the mass spectrometry technique, a large amount of information that forms the basis of chemistry and graph theory, and information that might be helpful in finding the solution of a particular chemical structure elucidation problem. This “knowledge base” is used both to search for possible chemical structures that match the input data, and to learn new “general rules” that help prune searches. The benefit Dendral provides the end user, even a non-expert, is a minimized set of possible solutions to check manually.

== Heuristics ==

A heuristic is a rule of thumb, an algorithm that does not guarantee a solution, but reduces the number of possible solutions by discarding unlikely and irrelevant solutions. The use of heuristics to solve problems is called &quot;heuristics programming&quot;, and was used in Dendral to allow it to replicate in machines the process through which human experts induce the solution to problems via rules of thumb and specific information.

Heuristics programming was a major approach and a giant step forward in artificial intelligence, as it allowed scientists to finally automate certain traits of human intelligence. It became prominent among scientists in the late 1940s through George Polya’s book, &quot;How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method&quot;. As Herbert A. Simon said in &quot;The Sciences of the Artificial&quot;, &quot;if you take a heuristic conclusion as certain, you may be fooled and disappointed; but if you neglect heuristic conclusions altogether you will make no progress at all.&quot;

== History ==

During the mid 20th century, the question &quot;can machines think?&quot; became intriguing and popular among scientists, primarily to add humanistic characteristics to machine behavior. John McCarthy, who was one of the prime researchers of this field, termed this concept of machine intelligence as &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (AI) during the Dartmouth summer in 1956. AI is usually defined as the capacity of a machine to perform operations that are analogous to human cognitive capabilities. Much research to create AI was done during the 20th century.

Also around the mid 20th century, science, especially biology, faced a fast-increasing need to develop a &quot;man-computer symbiosis&quot;, to aid scientists in solving problems. For example, the structural analysis of myogoblin, hemoglobin, and other proteins relentlessly needed instrumentation development due to its complexity.

In the early 1960s, Joshua Lederberg started working with computers and quickly became tremendously interested in creating interactive computers to help him in his exobiology research. Specifically, he was interested in designing computing systems to help him study alien organic compounds. Lederberg had been heading a team designing instruments for the Mars Viking lander to search for precursor molecules of life in samples of the Mars surface, using a mass spectrometer coupled with a minicomputer. As he was not an expert in either chemistry or computer programming, he collaborated with Stanford chemist Carl Djerassi to help him with chemistry, and Edward Feigenbaum with programming, to automate the process of determining chemical structures from raw mass spectrometry data. Feigenbaum was an expert in programming languages and heuristics, and helped Lederberg design a system that replicated the way Djerassi solved structure elucidation problems. They devised a system called Dendritic Algorithm (Dendral) that was able to generate possible chemical structures corresponding to the mass spectrometry data as an output.

Dendral then was still very inaccurate in assessing spectra of ketones, alcohols, and isomers of chemical compounds. Thus, Djerassi &quot;taught&quot; general rules to Dendral that could help eliminate most of the &quot;chemically implausible&quot; structures, and produce a set of structures that could now be analyzed by a &quot;non-expert&quot; user to determine the right structure. The new rules include more knowledge of mass spectrometry and general chemistry. He also expanded the system so it can incorporate to NMR spectroscopy data in addition to mass spectrometry data.

The Dendral team recruited Bruce Buchanan to extend the Lisp program initially written by Georgia Sutherland. Buchanan had similar ideas to Feigenbaum and Lederberg, but his special interests were scientific discovery and hypothesis formation. As Joseph November said in &quot;Digitizing Life: The Introduction of Computers to Biology and Medicine&quot;, &quot;(Buchanan) wanted the system (Dendral) to make discoveries on its own, not just help humans make them&quot;. Buchanan, Lederberg and Feigenbaum designed &quot;Meta-Dendral&quot;, which was a &quot;hypothesis maker&quot;. Heuristic Dendral &quot;would serve as a template for similar knowledge-based systems in other areas&quot; rather than just concentrating in the field of organic chemistry. Meta-Dendral was a model for knowledge-rich learning systems that was later codified in Tom Mitchell&#x27;s influential Version Space Model of learning.

By 1970, Dendral was performing structural interpretation at post-doc level. Djerassi and his group would take over the program for their own research for a decade.

<text>Freedom of thought is the freedom of an individual to hold or consider a fact, viewpoint, or thought, independent of others&#x27; viewpoints.

== Overview ==
Every person attempts to have a cognitive proficiency by developing knowledge, concepts, theories and assessing them in the given environment. This cognitive proficiency gives a sense of contentment and replaces the feeling of helplessness. Apart from bringing ease to the ego of a person, new knowledge and ideas also bring a hope for the future.

Freedom of thought is the precursor and progenitor of—and thus is closely linked to—other liberties, including freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression. Though freedom of thought is axiomatic for many other freedoms, they are in no way required for it to operate and exist. The conception of a freedom or a right does not guarantee its inclusion, legality, or protection via a philosophical caveat. It is a very important concept in the Western world and nearly all democratic constitutions protect these freedoms.

For instance, the United States Bill of Rights contains the famous guarantee in the First Amendment that laws may not be made that interfere with religion &quot;or prohibiting the free exercise thereof&quot;. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo reasoned in &quot;Palko v. Connecticut&quot; (1937):

Such ideas are also a vital part of international human rights law. In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which is legally binding on member states of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), &quot;freedom of thought&quot; is listed under Article 18:

The United Nations&#x27; Human Rights Committee states that this &quot;distinguishes the freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief from the freedom to manifest religion or belief. It does not permit any limitations whatsoever on the freedom of thought and conscience or on the freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief of one&#x27;s choice. These freedoms are protected unconditionally&quot;. Similarly, Article 19 of the UDHR guarantees that &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference&quot;.

Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights states, &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.&quot;

==History of development and suppression==
It is impossible to know with certainty what another person is thinking, making suppression difficult. The concept is developed throughout the Bible, most fully in the writings of Saul of Tarsus (e.g., &quot;For why should my freedom [&quot;eleutheria&quot;] be judged by another&#x27;s conscience [&quot;suneideseos&quot;]?&quot; 1 Corinthians 10:29).
Although Greek philosophers Plato and Socrates had discussed freedom of thought minimally, the edicts of King Ashoka (3rd century BC) have been called the first decree respecting freedom of conscience. In European tradition, aside from the decree of religious toleration by Constantine I at Milan in 313, the philosophers Themistius, Michel de Montaigne, Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, Voltaire, Alexandre Vinet, and John Stuart Mill and the theologians Roger Williams and Samuel Rutherford have been considered major proponents of the idea of freedom of conscience (or &quot;soul liberty&quot; in the words of Williams).

Queen Elizabeth I revoked a thought censorship law in the late sixteenth century, because, according to Sir Francis Bacon, she did &quot;not [like] to make windows into men&#x27;s souls and secret thoughts&quot;. During her reign, however, a number of books published by theorist Giordano Bruno spurred controversy, mentioning topics banned by the Catholic Church such as the possibility of an infinite universe. Unwilling to recant these ideas, Bruno was eventually burned as a heretic in Rome by the Italian Inquisition, in turn becoming a martyr for free thought.

Oliver Cromwell is described by Ignaz von Döllinger as &quot;the first among the mighty men of the world to set up one special religious principle, and to enforce it so far as in him lay: ... The principle of liberty of conscience and the repudiation of religious coercion&quot;.

However, freedom of expression can be limited through censorship, arrests, book burning, or propaganda, and this tends to discourage freedom of thought. Examples of effective campaigns against freedom of expression are the Soviet suppression of genetics research in favor of a theory known as Lysenkoism, the book-burning campaigns of Nazi Germany, the radical anti-intellectualism enforced in Cambodia under Pol Pot and in Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler, the strict limits on freedom of expression imposed by the Communist governments of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and Cuba or by Capitalist dictatorships such as those of Augusto Pinochet in Chile and Francisco Franco in Spain.

The Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, which states that thought can be embedded in language, would support the claim that an effort to limit the use of words of language is actually a form of restricting freedom of thought. This was explored in George Orwell&#x27;s novel&quot; 1984&quot;, with the idea of Newspeak, a stripped-down form of the English language alleged to lack the capacity for metaphor and limiting expression of original ideas.

More recently, neuroimaging technology has raised concerns about entities possibly reading and subsequently suppressing thought. These concerns form the emerging fields of neuroethics and neuroprivacy.

<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Downes Jackson KCB (1777 – 9 June 1845), born at Petersfield in the English county of Hampshire, was an officer in the British Army and subsequently colonial Administrator. Following service during the Napoleonic Wars, he was appointed the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in British North America. During that time, he also served for a few months as the Administrator of the government of the Province of Canada. He died in Canada in 1845 and is buried there.

==Military career==
Jackson was commissioned as an ensign in the Coldstream Guards on 9 July 1794. After seeing action during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 he took part in the Battle of Copenhagen during the Napoleonic Wars. He fought at the Siege of Cádiz and the Battle of Barrosa during the Peninsular War and was knighted on 12 April 1815.

After the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, Jackson was appointed deputy quartermaster general in 1820, General Officer Commanding Northern District in 1836 and Commander-in-Chief, North America in 1839, a post which he held until his death in 1845.

==Administrator of Province of Canada==

In September 1841, Lord Sydenham, the Governor General of the Province of Canada, died in office. Jackson was appointed the Administrator of the Province. He exercised the powers of the Governor General until the arrival of Sydenham&#x27;s successor, Sir Charles Bagot in early 1842.

== Death ==

Jackson continued as Commander-in-Chief until 1845 when, missing his family in England, he asked to be recalled. Instead, he died suddenly in the summer of 1845, shortly before the arrival of his successor, Lord Cathcart. He was buried near his country home at William-Henry, Canada East (now Sorel, Quebec).

<text>Leslie Ash (born 19 February 1960) is an English actress. She is best known for her roles in &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; (1979), ITV series &quot;C.A.T.S. Eyes&quot; (1985–1987), the BBC sitcom &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot; (1992–1998), drama &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; (2000–2003), and medical drama &quot;Holby City&quot; (2009–2010). 

==Early career==
Ash was born in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, and first appeared on British television in 1964 at the age of four asking &quot;Mummy, why are your hands so soft?&quot; in an advertisement for the washing-up product Fairy Liquid. She was educated at the independent Italia Conti Academy stage school and then started a career as a fashion model, appearing on the cover of a number of teen magazines, including &quot;Pink&quot; and &quot;Jackie&quot;.

Having appeared with her sister Debbie in the 1978 British slapstick comedy &quot;Rosie Dixon – Night Nurse&quot;, her first major film role was playing the romantic lead in &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; in 1979. In 1980, Ash appeared in the Iron Maiden music video &quot;Women in Uniform&quot; and one of the two Dire Straits music videos of &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;. In 1982, she played the role of a fast food chef in the fifth series of &quot;Shelley&quot; in the episode entitled &quot;When the Chip Hits the Fan&quot;, and appeared opposite Joan Collins in the film &quot;Nutcracker&quot;. Also in 1982, Ash appeared in a TV adaptation of &quot;Outside Edge&quot;. In 1983, she had the starring role in &quot;The Balance of Nature&quot;, a film about a Cockney girl from a tower block with aspirations to win the Miss United Kingdom competition. The same year, she played Julie Morgan, &quot;alias&quot; Juletta Shane, in &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot;, and also appeared opposite Nicky Henson as Nancy in the ITV situation comedy &quot;The Happy Apple&quot;, playing a secretary whose opinions successfully reflected public opinion. She then played a regular role in crime series &quot;C.A.T.S. Eyes&quot;. From 1983 until 1987, she was a co-presenter on the Channel 4 music programme &quot;The Tube&quot; alongside Jools Holland and Paula Yates. In 1984, she appeared opposite Roger Daltrey and former &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; co-star Toyah Willcox in the thriller &quot;&quot;, and played Carol Landau in the 1985 comedy film &quot;Shadey&quot;, directed by Philip Saville.

In 1987, Ash appeared in the first episode of the third series of the ITV comedy series &quot;Home to Roost&quot;, entitled &quot;Human Interest&quot;, where she played the role of the flamboyant cleaner, Susie Perkins.

Ash is also well known for playing Deborah (Debs), the upstairs tenant and love interest for Neil Morrissey, in the situation comedy &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot;. One of the four regulars, she continued in the role for six seasons. She subsequently acted in BBC police drama &quot;Merseybeat&quot; and the ITV drama &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;.

In 1996, during her time on &quot;Men Behaving Badly&quot;, Leslie released a single &quot;Tell Him&quot; with co-star Caroline Quentin, under the name of Quentin &amp; Ash. It reached number 25 in the UK singles chart.

==Later work==
Ash appeared in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s comic radio series, &quot;Vent&quot; (2007), alongside Neil Pearson, Fiona Allen and Josie Lawrence.

In May 2008, Ash worked with Transparent Television to make a documentary about the unregulated cosmetic beauty industry while exploring her own experiences. The programme, &quot;Leslie Ash: Face to Face&quot;, was broadcast on ITV on 23 September 2008.

In 2009, Ash appeared on daytime TV panel programme &quot;Loose Women&quot; to discuss her new role in &quot;Holby City&quot; and her previous health problems. Leslie reappeared on &quot;Loose Women&quot; on 17 February 2012, where she discussed her stage tour of &quot;All the Single Ladies&quot;.

In 2014, Leslie was a contestant on the BBC programme &quot;Celebrity Masterchef&quot;. In 2020, she appeared opposite many of her &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; co-stars in the unofficial semi-sequel &quot;To Be Someone&quot;. In 2021, it was announced that she would be reprising her role as Vanessa Lytton in an episode of &quot;Holby City&quot;″s sister series &quot;Casualty&quot;. In the same year, she also appeared in an episode of the BBC soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot; as Mary McRae.

Her book, &quot;My Life Behaving Badly: The Autobiography&quot;, was published in 2007.

==Personal life==
Ash is married to former footballer Lee Chapman, and they have two sons. Her sister is former Hot Gossip dancer Debbie Ash. They appeared together as sisters in &quot;Rosie Dixon – Night Nurse&quot;.

===Health===
Ash contracted toxoplasmosis two months into her pregnancy while in France, where it is more common than in the United Kingdom. She told the BBC that she wished to raise awareness of the issue in Britain.

Ash was hospitalised at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in April 2004 after suffering two cracked ribs. She was discharged after a few days, but was readmitted after losing all feeling in her legs. In June 2004 while she was still in hospital, it was announced that a &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; infection might have rendered her permanently unable to walk. 

In January 2007 Ash confirmed she was suing the hospital. Papers lodged at the High Court asserted that Ash would never return to active TV roles. The hospital admitted breach of duty over part of her treatment but denied responsibility for the extent of her injuries and in January 2008 paid out a record £5m compensation in an out-of-court settlement. Steve Walker, chief executive of the NHS Litigation Authority, said the payout set a new record for compensation following a hospital-acquired infection. The previous highest amount was £500,000. The payment was justified by the NHS compensation body as being &quot;because of the amount Leslie was earning at the time she fell ill and takes into account how much she might have earned in the future&quot;.

===Lip implants===
In her 30s, Ash had a collagen injection to &quot;plump up&quot; her lips. When she was 40 she decided to repeat the procedure with the same plastic surgeon, the mother of a Venezuelan friend. In the second procedure, liquid silicone was injected resulting in extreme swelling of her lips, a condition dubbed as &quot;trout pout&quot; in the press. Subsequent medical analysis showed that the silicone had set and the condition is permanent. During this time Ash starred in a series of advertisements for the DIY chain Homebase (again, with Neil Morrissey) and starred in &quot;Merseybeat&quot;, which evoked further ridicule from the media about her appearance.

Ash has since spoken out about the press ridicule she received as a result of her botched implants, commenting: &quot;If I&#x27;d lost a leg in a car crash, people wouldn&#x27;t have felt able to take the mickey out of me so mercilessly ... People don&#x27;t laugh at Heather Mills because she lost a leg.&quot;

==&quot;News of the World&quot; legal action==

Ash and Chapman sued the &quot;News of the World&quot; for breach of privacy over suspicions that their voicemails, and those of their two sons, were illegally accessed by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. They wrote to the police over their suspicions, and the police informed them that there were four pieces of paper referring to Ash in Mulcaire&#x27;s notebooks, and five items relating to Chapman. There were further items relating to their children.

In August 2011, Ash and Chapman settled a claim against the paper and Mulcaire for an undisclosed sum and received an apology. They planned to take action against other newspapers.

<doc id="557931" wikidata="Q2479726" url="?curid=557931" title="Graph (abstract data type)">
<text>In computer science, a graph is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics.

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of &quot;vertices&quot; (also called &quot;nodes&quot; or &quot;points&quot;), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as &quot;edges&quot; (also called &quot;links&quot; or &quot;lines&quot;), and for a directed graph are also known as &quot;edges&quot; but also sometimes &quot;arrows&quot; or &quot;arcs&quot;. The vertices may be part of the graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or references.

A graph data structure may also associate to each edge some &quot;edge value&quot;, such as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute (cost, capacity, length, etc.).

==Operations==

The basic operations provided by a graph data structure &quot;G&quot; usually include:
* : tests whether there is an edge from the vertex &quot;x&quot; to the vertex &quot;y&quot;;
* : lists all vertices &quot;y&quot; such that there is an edge from the vertex &quot;x&quot; to the vertex &quot;y&quot;;
* : adds the vertex &quot;x&quot;, if it is not there;
* : removes the vertex &quot;x&quot;, if it is there;
* : adds the edge &quot;z&quot; from the vertex &quot;x&quot; to the vertex &quot;y&quot;, if it is not there;
* : removes the edge from the vertex &quot;x&quot; to the vertex &quot;y&quot;, if it is there;
* : returns the value associated with the vertex &quot;x&quot;;
* : sets the value associated with the vertex &quot;x&quot; to &quot;v&quot;.

Structures that associate values to the edges usually also provide:
* : returns the value associated with the edge (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;);
* : sets the value associated with the edge (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) to &quot;v&quot;.

==Common data structures for graph representation==
; Adjacency list
: Vertices are stored as records or objects, and every vertex stores a list of adjacent vertices. This data structure allows the storage of additional data on the vertices. Additional data can be stored if edges are also stored as objects, in which case each vertex stores its incident edges and each edge stores its incident vertices.
; Adjacency matrix
: A two-dimensional matrix, in which the rows represent source vertices and columns represent destination vertices. Data on edges and vertices must be stored externally. Only the cost for one edge can be stored between each pair of vertices.
; Incidence matrix
: A two-dimensional matrix, in which the rows represent the vertices and columns represent the edges. The entries indicate the incidence relation between the vertex at a row and edge at a column.

The following table gives the time complexity cost of performing various operations on graphs, for each of these representations, with |&quot;V&quot;| the number of vertices and |&quot;E&quot;| the number of edges. In the matrix representations, the entries encode the cost of following an edge. The cost of edges that are not present are assumed to be ∞.

Adjacency lists are generally preferred for the representation of sparse graphs, while an adjacency matrix is preferred if the graph is dense; that is, the number of edges formula_1 is close to the number of vertices squared, formula_2, or if one must be able to quickly look up if there is an edge connecting two vertices.

=== More efficient representation of adjacency sets ===

The time complexity of operations in the adjacency list representation can be improved by storing the sets of adjacent vertices in more efficient data structures, such as hash tables or balanced binary search trees (the latter representation requires that vertices are identified by elements of a linearly ordered set, such as integers or character strings). A representation of adjacent vertices via hash tables leads to an amortized average time complexity of formula_3 to test adjacency of two given vertices and to remove an edge and an amortized average time complexity of formula_4 to remove a given vertex of degree formula_5. The time complexity of the other operations and the asymptotic space requirement do not change.

== Parallel representations ==
The parallelization of graph problems faces significant challenges: Data-driven computations, unstructured problems, poor locality and high data access to computation ratio. The graph representation used for parallel architectures plays a significant role in facing those challenges. Poorly chosen representations may unnecessarily drive up the communication cost of the algorithm, which will decrease its scalability. In the following, shared and distributed memory architectures are considered.

=== Shared memory ===
In the case of a shared memory model, the graph representations used for parallel processing are the same as in the sequential case, since parallel read-only access to the graph representation (e.g. an adjacency list) is efficient in shared memory.

=== Distributed memory ===
In the distributed memory model, the usual approach is to partition the vertex set formula_6 of the graph into formula_7 sets formula_8. Here, formula_7 is the amount of available processing elements (PE). The vertex set partitions are then distributed to the PEs with matching index, additionally to the corresponding edges. Every PE has its own subgraph representation, where edges with an endpoint in another partition require special attention. For standard communication interfaces like MPI, the ID of the PE owning the other endpoint has to be identifiable. During computation in a distributed graph algorithms, passing information along these edges implies communication.

Partitioning the graph needs to be done carefully - there is a trade-off between low communication and even size partitioning But partitioning a graph is a NP-hard problem, so it is not feasible to calculate them. Instead, the following heuristics are used.

1D partitioning: Every processor gets formula_10 vertices and the corresponding outgoing edges. This can be understood as a row-wise or column-wise decomposition of the adjacency matrix. For algorithms operating on this representation, this requires an All-to-All communication step as well as formula_11 message buffer sizes, as each PE potentially has outgoing edges to every other PE.

2D partitioning: Every processor gets a submatrix of the adjacency matrix. Assume the processors are aligned in a rectangle formula_12, where formula_13 and formula_14 are the amount of processing elements in each row and column, respectively. Then each processor gets a submatrix of the adjacency matrix of dimension formula_15. This can be visualized as a checkerboard pattern in a matrix. Therefore, each processing unit can only have outgoing edges to PEs in the same row and column. This bounds the amount of communication partners for each PE to formula_16 out of formula_12 possible ones.

==Compressed representations==

Graphs with trillions of edges occur in machine learning, social network analysis, and other areas. Compressed graph representations have been developed to reduce I/O and memory requirements. General techniques such as Huffman coding are applicable, but the adjacency list or adjacency matrix can be processed in specific ways to increase efficiency.

== Graph traversal ==

=== Breadth first search and depth first search ===
Breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) are two closely-related approaches that are used for exploring all of the nodes in a given connected component. Both start with an arbitrary node, the &quot;root&quot;.

<doc id="557935" wikidata="Q6226399" url="?curid=557935" title="John Clitherow">
<text>Lieutenant-General John Clitherow (13 December 1782 – 14 October 1852) was a British army officer and colonial administrator. He was briefly Deputy Governor-General of the Province of Canada in 1841.

==Early life and family==
Clitherow was born at Essendon, Hertfordshire, England in 1782, the son of Christopher Clitherow and Anne Jodrell. He was descended from Sir Christopher Clitherow, Member of Parliament (1628-1629) and Lord Mayor of London in 1635. The Clitherow family were wealthy London merchants throughout the 17th and 18th centuries and owned Boston Manor House in Brentford (now part of London), from 1670 onwards.

In 1809, Clitherow married Sarah Christie Burton, daughter of General Napier Christie Burton and granddaughter of General Gabriel Christie, who had served with the British Army in the Revolutionary War, afterwards settling in Lower Canada, where he acquired extensive land-holdings. Clitherow and his wife had one son, John Christie Clitherow, who eventually served in the Coldstream Guards. However, the marriage ended when Clitherow divorced Sarah in 1819, by private Act of Parliament. In 1825, Clitherow married Millicent Pole of Gloucestershire.

== Military career ==

Clitherow enlisted in the British Army as an ensign in 1799. He served in the Egyptian campaign of 1801, an expedition to Germany in 1805, and an expedition to the Netherlands in 1809. He participated in the Peninsular War from 1810 to 1815, being wounded twice. He was promoted to colonel in 1821, and to major-general in 1830.

In 1838, Clitherow was posted to British North America, to serve as commanding officer of the military district of Montreal. He was accompanied by his son, who served as his &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;. Clitherow arrived in Montreal in March, 1838, shortly after the Lower Canada Rebellion had broken out in late 1837.

He served as an advisor to Lord Durham as a member of the Special Council that administered Lower Canada following the rebellion.

When the second rebellion broke out Clitherow commanded 3,000 regulars that marched on rebel headquarters. He also presided over courts martial that prosecuted the rebels.

In 1841, he was transferred to Canada West to command British forces there.

== Deputy Governor General ==

The Governor General of the Province of Canada, Lord Sydenham, appointed him as Deputy Governor General. In that capacity, on 18 September 1841, Clitherow prorogued the first session of the first Parliament of the Province of Canada. Sydenham was unable to carry out his functions, as he had been badly injured by a fall from a horse. He died the day after Parliament was prorogued.

Clitherow remained the Deputy Governor General for six days, until the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Canada, Sir Richard Downes Jackson, was appointed as Administrator.

==Retirement and death ==
In 1842, Clitherow inherited the family estate, Boston Manor in Brentford, England. He retired to England that year.

Clitherow died at Boston Manor House in 1852.

<doc id="557941" wikidata="Q4992110" url="?curid=557941" title="Marshall Flinkman">
<text>Marshall J. Flinkman is a fictional character on the television series, &quot;Alias&quot;. Flinkman, portrayed by Kevin Weisman, is the tech geek at SD-6 and then later the CIA. When a field agent is sent on a mission, Marshall serves in a function similar to Q from the James Bond films: as the in-house creator and proprietor of a number of gadgets and sophisticated tools used by field agent. UGO.com named him one of the best TV nerds.

==Characterization==
Marshall has a quirky and eccentric personality, which contrasts with the stern nature of those around him. He is also socially inept, having a tendency to speak very rapidly, often babbling about tangential subjects in the middle of technical briefings (before someone impatiently brings Marshall back on to the topic at hand). He is always dressed well and wears his hair in a slick sidepart. He has a fondness for unnecessary visual aids when giving a presentation, once even playing a full drum set to make a point (actor Weisman is in a rock band). However, his expertise in almost any subject imaginable is unparalleled, being well-versed in robotics, chemistry, acoustics, electronics, biometrics, explosives, computer networks, and many other subjects. He also has an eidetic memory.

==Storylines==
Like Sydney, he initially believes SD-6 is a black ops division of the CIA. Because he is not a field agent, he often doctors photographs of himself in exotic locations to fool his mother into thinking he works for a company requiring a lot of travel; he once asked Sydney to take the photographs for said images. When SD-6 is destroyed, Marshall is brought into the CIA for real. Unlike his colleague Marcus Dixon, he adjusts to the change easily and soon becomes a valued member of the team. Starting in the second season, Marshall found a love interest, an NSA agent with similar geekish tendencies, Carrie Bowman. Eventually the two got married and had a child, Mitchell.

During the third season, Marshall experiences great character growth, realizing most people do not understand quantum entanglement, understanding how he appears to others and offering suggestions for operations (which are implemented without comment). At the conclusion of the third season, Marshall is shot and seriously wounded by Lauren Reed. By the start of the fourth season (several months later in the timeframe of the series), he has fully recovered from his injuries and is recruited into the new Authorized Personnel Only (APO) black ops offshoot of the CIA (albeit as a &#x27;late&#x27; addition to the organization, when they realized that they needed his computer expertise early in their first assignment).

Marshall serves as comic relief for the &quot;Alias&quot; series, but he has some serious moments when he is worried about those he cares about, including Sydney, but mostly revolving around Carrie and Mitchell. Marshall has also discovered how hard it is to lie to those he loves, having to keep his job at APO a secret even from his wife (who appears to no longer be working for the NSA by the fourth season).

Marshall rarely works as a field operative, and then only when his expertise in computers is required. This was a key factor in the two-part storyline in the second-season episodes &quot;The Abduction&quot; and &quot;A Higher Echelon&quot;, where Marshall accompanied Sydney to hack a classified database on-site and was subsequently abducted by a terrorist cell seeking the same information, requiring Sydney to return him to SD-6 when she had made arrangements for him to be picked up by the CIA and told the truth about Sloane and SD-6 after that mission was over. In the fourth season episode &quot;Tuesday&quot;, Marshall is forced to go on a solo mission to rescue Sydney, buried alive somewhere in Cuba, after the rest of APO is incapacitated when a biological agent released by an enemy forces a lockdown of headquarters. Marshall, delayed in arriving at HQ due to a problem with his baby, avoids being caught in the lockdown and becomes the only APO agent able to save Sydney. Later in the mission, when required to make contact with an enemy agent while APO was still on lockdown and the man had already met Sydney, he accidentally shoots and kills the agent while attempting to keep him occupied while Sydney tracks a crucial item in his possession; it is not made clear whether this is the first time Marshall has killed anyone.

The fifth season was largely business as usual for Marshall, although he has also struck up a friendship-cum- with new APO recruit Rachel Gibson, who had primarily served as a data analyst for current foe Gordon Dean before his true agenda was exposed, although she alternated between taking a field role and acting as Marshall&#x27;s assistant in the office. The series finale saw Marshall return briefly to the field as part of APO&#x27;s efforts to capture intel on Prophet Five. He was later kidnapped from his home by Kelly Peyton and tortured, resisting admirably until at Sydney&#x27;s urging he cooperated as part of a plan to rescue him and the also-abducted Rachel, allowing him to pass on a discreet message that would help his wife Carrie track his online activity and identify his location. Marshall continued to provide tech support as the various members of APO raced around the world to thwart the endgames of Arvin Sloane and Irina Derevko, including remotely inputting the codes to stand down missiles Irina had targeted on Washington, D.C., and London.

In a flash forward at the very end of the final episode, it is revealed Marshall and Carrie have two more children and Carrie is pregnant with their fourth.

==Carrie Bowman==

Carrie Bowman, played by Amanda Foreman, is an NSA agent and wife of Marshall Flinkman.

Carrie is introduced in Season 2, where she worked at the CIA headquarters in Los Angeles with Marshall. Eventually the two formed a relationship resulting in marriage and the birth of their son, Mitchell. This, of course, happened in typical Marshall fashion. The two decided they were to be wed before the birth of the baby, but Carrie began to go into labor in the middle of an important mission. Marshall quickly enlists Eric Weiss to become legally ordained online (through the &quot;Internet Church of Mammals&quot;) so he can marry the two (while Marshall continues to guide Sydney and Vaughn through their mission), bolting at the last second to take his wife to the hospital.

Carrie is strong-willed and tends to get her way in disputes with her husband, and though she tries to keep him in check with her quick wit and sarcasm, they ultimately balance each other out and love one another deeply.

Beginning in the fourth season, Carrie seems to have given up her NSA job to take care of Mitchell. She is unaware Marshall still works for the CIA, since APO is black ops and he is under orders to keep it secret. She only appeared in one fourth season episode (&quot;Tuesday&quot;), and prior to the series finale appeared in one episode during the fifth season (&quot;...1...&quot;).

For the series finale, Carrie learned Marshall was still with the CIA when he was kidnapped by agents of Arvin Sloane. She worked with APO to rescue Marshall and the also-abducted Rachel, demonstrating technical prowess rivalling Marshall&#x27;s, quickly understanding a discreet clue Marshall passed to Sydney that allowed her to track their location from the source of the digital activity.

In the flash forward several years into the future presented at the end of the series finale, it is mentioned Marshall and Carrie have two more children after Mitchell, with another on the way, and all are boys.

<text>Fortress America is a strategic board wargame designed by Michael Gray and published in 1986 by Milton Bradley. The game depicts a 21st Century United States being invaded on three sides by three world powers. &quot;Fortress America&quot; was the fourth of five games in the &quot;Gamemaster&quot; series.

==Overview==
Set in the 21st century, the board game begins with the premise that during the Cold War, nuclear terrorists destroyed much of the Middle East&#x27;s supply of oil. In response, the United States launched into orbit a satellite based solar-power system to solve the energy crisis. At the same time, the U.S. had perfected the so-called &quot;Star Wars&quot; technology and incorporated a satellite-based laser system into the solar satellites. This system was capable of destroying intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) before impact. Thus, the USA was completely safe from nuclear threat, ending the era of Mutual Assured Destruction.

This creates a great deal of political turmoil - the USSR is especially upset at the nuclear balance of power being shifted - and while the rest of the world realigns in various ways (through alliances and treaties as well as conventional military conflict) the United States, complacent in its technical superiority, becomes isolationist in nature.

The game opens with the world divided into three major world powers outside of the US:

1) The Asian Peoples Alliance (yellow player)

2) The Central American Federation (blue player)

3) The Euro-Socialist Pact (red player)

These three powers have launched a surprise invasion of the now-conventionally-weak United States: Asian invaders on the Pacific coast, Central American invaders along the Southwestern border with Mexico, and the Euro-Soviet invaders along the Eastern Seaboard. The United States Navy is brushed aside. The Army and Air Force, still capable of resistance, are nevertheless insufficient to halt the multi-pronged invasions.

The unique nature of this game is the notion of three of four players cooperating for the elimination of one player (the US). The game has an interesting dynamic of the US player being outnumbered 3:1 in military strength but steadily being reinforced by laser relay towers which each have a 60% chance to destroy an enemy unit anywhere on the board each turn. The rules of combat also favor the defender. 

The invaders must place their reinforcements, which arrive on an even basis over the first few turns and then run out entirely, in their own invasion zones, which are sometimes far from the front, while the U.S. never runs out and can often be reinforced right at the front. The American player receives reinforcements by drawing two cards per turn, which sometimes specify for partisans or military forces to appear behind enemy lines. 

Others allow the U.S. to reconstruct shattered units from the dead pile in home cities, while all invading units are permanently out of play when lost in combat. The result is a game that - if played well by all players - will result in a very close contest. There are 30 cities represented on the board and the invaders must capture, and hold until the end of an entire turn, 18 or more of them to win the game. This allows the U.S. one round to counterattack and recapture after all the invaders have played a round and temporarily achieved their goal of 18.

==Original Milton Bradley release==
Commercially, this was considered to be the third most successful board game in Milton Bradley&#x27;s &quot;Gamemaster Series&quot; placing it in the middle of the pack. However, world events and popular culture and Hollywood have influenced a small resurgence in the game&#x27;s popularity evidenced by the 2012 remake and re-issue.

The original game also had two different covers. The first had an image which resembled Saddam Hussein and the other cover replaced the Saddam look-a-like with a bearded and sunglasses-wearing version.

===Reception===
In 1987, &quot;Fortress America&quot; won the Charles S. Roberts Award for &quot;Best 20th Century Game of 1986&quot;.

==Fantasy Flight Game Release==
In 2012 Fantasy Flight Games released a remake of Fortress America with a few design changes. A few new rule changes have been implemented. The game now has a fixed maximum number of turns. Mechanized units can &quot;transport&quot; foot units. 

A few objectives were changed on the map. Reflecting population shifts, Kansas City and Buffalo are no longer depicted. Las Vegas and Colorado Springs have been added, and resource areas were juggled. The attackers have optional event cards. A few of the old cards were changed, and one new &quot;free laser complex&quot; card was added for a total of 31 cards.
