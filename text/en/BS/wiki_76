<text>Rhacodactylus leachianus, commonly known as the New Caledonian giant gecko, Leach&#x27;s giant gecko, leachianus gecko, or Leachie, is the largest living species of gecko and a member of the family Diplodactylidae. It is native to most of New Caledonia.

== Taxonomy ==
The specific name, &quot;leachianus&quot;, is in honor of English zoologist William Elford Leach. Historically, there have been three recognized subspecies of &quot;R. leachianus&quot; (including the nominotypical subspecies): &quot;R. l. aubrianus&quot;, &quot;R. l. henkeli&quot; (first described by and in 1994), and &quot;R. l. leachianus&quot;. However, based on recent molecular data, no populations of &quot;R. leachianus&quot; are granted subspecies status at the present time. Instead, locality based morphotypes are used to distinguish populations of &quot;R. leachianus.&quot;

==Description==

&quot;R. leachianus&quot; is the largest extant gecko in the world and is considered an example of island gigantism. &quot;R. leachianus&quot; of the Grande Terre localities are capable of growing long, with a weight range between 250 and 500 grams. &quot;R. leachianus&quot; of the Insular localities are capable of growing 9–12&quot; (23–30 cm) long, and weighting between 150 and 300 grams. It has a heavy body, loose skin, and a small, stumpy tail. It is variable in color, coming in shades of mottled green, gray, and brown, sometimes with highlights of white, orange, and/or pink. It was only exceed in size by the now extinct &quot;Gigarcanum delcourti&quot; known from a single specimen 50% longer and probably several times heavier than the largest &quot;R. leachianus&quot; specimens, which also originated from New Caledonia.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; is found in all of the southern and eastern portions of the main island of New Caledonia, as well as on several of the smaller islands in the group. Topographical and ecological differences observed at each locality may have contributed to the phenotypical and morphological differences seen in &quot;R. leachianus&quot;. The insular locality of Duu Ana is thought to no longer have an extant population of &quot;R. Leachianus&quot;.

=== Localities of &quot;R. leachianus&quot; ===
&quot;R. Leachianus&quot; often show locality-specific phenotypical coloration, size, and morphological differences called morphotypes. The largest locality group of &quot;R. leachianus&quot; are those found on the main island of New Caledonia, Grande Terre. The localities associated with Grande Terre, often referred to as the &quot;mainland localities&quot;, include the Yate locale, the Mount Khogis locale, the Goro locale, the Poindimie locale, and the Mount Humboldt locale. Early on, a typing system was created in attempt to group phenotypical traits seen on Grande Terre together. This typing system included Type A, Type B, and Type C &quot;R. leachianus&quot;. However, this typing system is no longer considered an accurate means of locale identification, but is still commonly used for generalization within the pet trade. Type A &quot;R. leachianus&quot; were those that had little to no patterning on the laterals, containing a dark, solid or webbed background coloration. Type B &quot;R. leachianus&quot; were those that displayed lateral patterning in the form of linear blotches, or solid-colored vertical bars, commonly paired with a dark base coloration. Type B &quot;R. leachianus&quot; were said to be the most patterned of the various types. Type C &quot;R. leachianus&quot; were those that are slow growing, large geckos, commonly paired with light blotching and a dark base color. Type C &quot;R. leachianus&quot; are reported to grow up to 17 inches in length.

&quot;R. leachianus&quot; are also found on the neighboring islands of Grant Terre, commonly referred to as the &quot;insular localities&quot;. These Insular localities include the Isle of Pines locale, the Nuu Ami locale, the Nuu Ana locale, the Duu Ana locale, the Moro locale, the Bayonnaise locale, the Brosse locale, and the Caanawa locale.

==== Yate (mainland) ====

&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found in the Yate region are recognized as one of the largest localities, being heavy bodied, bulky animals. They often have elongated tails in comparison to most other locales. Yate &quot;R. leachianus&quot; can reach above 400 grams, and grow up to 15 inches in length. they are found to have a base coloration that can range from a dark brown to golden yellow. Dark netting or thin webbing is also commonly found accompanying the base coloration. Thin, white lines may also be present on the laterals.

==== Mount Khogis (mainland) ====
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found in the Mount Khogis region are also among the largest of the locales, commonly reaching over 300 grams. Mount Khogis &quot;R. leachianus&quot; display base colorations that range from jet black to olive green. These individuals may possess enlarged scales that run the length of the snout ridges, which can be used as a differentiating factor for this locale. White blotches may also be present on the laterals, varying widely in size.

==== Goro (mainland) ====
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found in the Goro locality are a large locale, reaching up to 17 inches in length and 500 grams. Goro &quot;R. leachianus&quot; are dark in coloration, with accompanying white blotches that run vertically in rows along the lateral sides. White specking may also be present along the entire body of the individual.

==== Poindimie (mainland) ====
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found in the Poindimie region are often longer and leaner than other mainland localities. Poindimie &quot;R. leachianus&quot; are one of the largest localities, reaching over 400 grams. Base coloration is often variable, including greens, blacks, yellows, and browns. Little to no patterning is seen in the Poindimie locale, however, yellow or white spotting may occur with age.

==== Mount Humboldt (mainland) ====

&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found in the Mount Humboldt region are large bodied, bulky individuals. Base coloration is often described as variable, ranging from blacks to browns and greens. White blotches may be present, commonly covering the laterals and occasionally on the dorsal. Mount Humboldt &quot;R. Leachianus&quot; may reach up to 420 grams in weight.

==== Brosse (Insular) ====
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found on the island Brosse are often referred to as one of the larger insular forms with a robust shape. The coloration is often yellow or green, with large pink or white blotching, accompanied by black flecking. this locality may be referred to as the &quot;striped neck&quot; locale, due to bars that begin just after the head and continue down the neck area. Brosse Locality &quot;R. leachianus&quot; can weigh roughly 250g, and measure up to 10 inches in length. The island of Brosse is also referred to as &quot;Isle D&quot;.

==== Bayonnaise (Insular) ====
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found on the island Bayonnaise are characterized by a yellow-green base color, often displaying banding that covers the laterals and dorsal. This banding can range from thinner blotched white band to larger pink, purple, or white bands. The Island of Bayonnaise is also known as &quot;Isle C&quot;.

==== Nuu Ana (Insular) ====
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found on the island of Nuu Ana is the smallest recorded locality of &quot;R. leachianus.&quot; Nuu Ana individuals often have shorter limbs with an overall robust appearance. The Nuu Ana locale may reach up to 9 inches in length, and remain under 200 grams. The base color can range from various shades of greenish yellow, often with large colorful blotching or barring along the entire body of the gecko. The island of Nuu Ana is also known as &quot;Isle G&quot;.

==== Nuu Ami (Insular) ====

&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found on the island of Nuu Ami are a small locale, reaching up to 200 grams. Nuu Ami &quot;R. leachianus&quot; often display a darker gray iris in comparison to other localities. Base coloration may range from deep greens to bright yellows, commonly accompanied by white or pink blotching. Nuu Ami locality &quot;R. leachianus&quot; may also have spots or blotching arranged in a &quot;W&quot; shape along the dorsal area. The island of Nuu Ami is also known as &quot;Isle H&quot;.

==== Duu Ana (Insular) ====
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found on the island of Duu Ana are characterized by their dark green-brown base coloration, along with light colored barring that lines the laterals of the gecko. Barring may also be present along the dorsal. Duu Ana &quot;R. leachianus&quot; often display morphological traits, such as larger legs in comparison to other insular localities. It is speculated that this locality may eat crabs, due to low availability of fruit matter on the island. The Duu Ana locale is thought to be extinct in the wild, though, evidence is needed. Smaller breeding populations remain in captivity. The island of Duu Ana is also known as &quot;Isle I&quot;.

==== Caanawa (Insular) ====
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found on the island of Caanawa are a larger insular locality. The base coloration is often variable, ranging from browns to light green. The patterning on Caanawa &quot;R. leachianus&quot; often display deep purple blotching or barring, with a significant amount of black peppering. The island of Caanawa is also known as &quot;Isle K&quot;.

==== Isle of Pines (Insular) ====
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found on the Isle of Pines are the largest of the Insular localities, reaching up to 12 inches in length and surpassing 300 grams. The Isle of Pines locality is often characterized by large head and neck regions, with a robust appearance. Base coloration is often deep green, but also can range from brown to yellow. This is accompanied by white blotches present on the laterals and dorsal area of the gecko. The Isle of Pines can also be referred to as &quot;Pine Island&quot;.

==== Moro (Insular) ====
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; found on the Island of Moro is one of the largest insular localities, reaching up to 12 to 13 inches in length. The Moro locality often displays a green base color, with large pink or white blotching. The head shape for the Moro locality is large with a snout that is squared off. The island of Moro is also known as &quot;Isle E&quot;.

==Biology==

&quot;R. leachianus&quot; is an arboreal species; it is primarily nocturnal and remains hidden in tree hollows during the day. it has a diet that includes insects, spiders, small vertebrates, fruit, nectar, and sap. The most common component of &quot;R. leachianus&quot; diet consists of the fruit from &quot;Cassine curtipendula&quot;, a small fruit with a large seed that is often seen in fecal matter. It is speculated that the elongated snouts of mainland locality &quot;R. leachianus&quot; suggest a diet model that contains more vertebrate and insect matter than their insular locality counter-parts. Records of cannibalism among &quot;R. leachianus&quot; have been recorded, but this phenomenon could be attributed to territorial defense. These giant geckos can climb vertically up glass surfaces. This is due to adhesive pads on their feet called lamellae, which are made up of tiny hairs which increase friction force when applied to surfaces. &quot;R. Leachianus&quot; also possess large claws that aid in climbing as well. &quot;R. leachianus&quot; are capable of dropping their tail, a self-amputation process known as autotomy. Unlike &quot;Correlophus cilliatus, R. leachianus&quot; are capable of tail regeneration through a process known as epimorphosis. Males and females of &quot;R. leachianus&quot; display differentiating morphological characteristics known as sexual dimorphism. Male &quot;R. leachianus&quot; display a hemipenal bulge at the base of the tail, whereas females do not have this bulge. &quot;R. leachianus&quot; is observed to have temperature dependent sex determination. In captivity, eggs with a sustained incubated at 85 °F will often result in male offspring, and eggs that have a sustained incubation temperature of will result in female offspring.

=== Mating behavior and reproduction ===
Popular lore within the enthusiast lay community has promoted the notion that &quot;R. leachianus&quot; may pair monogamously in the wild and may remain compatible and establish a pair-bond, which may last for a single breeding season or persist for several years. In captivity, some hobbyists have responded to this notion of pair-bonding by keeping successful pairs together until the animals display incompatibility (fighting, injury, abject sequester by conspecific), at which time the bond-broken animals are separated permanently or reintroduced to one another at a later date (or introduced to different animals) in an attempt to establish a new pair-bond. It remains unclear whether the pair-bond is a real phenomenon for &quot;R. leachianus.&quot; Reports from the expeditions of herpetoculturalists philippe De Vosjoli, Frank Fast, and Bill Love, provide multiple accounts of monogamous pair bonding activity, as investigated tree hollows often housed a single pair of leachianus that remained for several weeks. Breeding behavior involves biting and thrashing that can become violent, often accompanied with locking jaws. The popular notion is that these behaviors may serve to test for pair compatibility and physical capability of a mate. However, it remains unclear whether the level of savagery witnessed in captivity is present in the wild populations. The necessary limits of an otherwise healthy captive environment may disallow some natural thresholds required for the resolution of conflict between conspecifics (for example, the natural required distance of separation may exceed the space limits in a captive setting). In the wild, a male-female pair of &quot;R. leachianus&quot; will commonly reside in an otherwise unoccupied tree hollow, which the pair will defend by displaying territorial behavior, such as vocalization. Tree hollow related behavior is similar to that of hollow nesting birds. Mate identification is thought to be done through a process called scent marking. Adult females of &quot;R. leachianus&quot; usually lay two eggs at a time (universal trait for all geckos), having up to 10 clutches per year. Older females in captivity may not lay clutches in a breeding season, even when paired with a compatible male. However, older females can lay clutches over the course of their entire adult lifespan. Pair incompatibility in a previously compatible pair may occur, often indicated by aggressive territorial behavior and injury. There have been reports of parthenogenesis in unpaired females in captivity, with some parthenogenic offspring reaching maturity with no apparent defects.

=== Vocalization ===
&quot;R. leachianus&quot; have the widest range of vocalizations of any member of the gekkonidae family. &quot;R. leachianus&quot; can make a loud growling noise, and local people call it &quot;the devil in the trees&quot;. This growling vocalization is speculated to be a warning call is often made in the presence of a predator or a rivaling &quot;R. leachianus.&quot; Clucking is another common vocalization, commonly associated with mate calling, often heard at night. A light whistle sound is used to display discomfort, or mild stress. Bird-like chirping is seen in the larger mainland localities, which incorporates a heightened stance and a gaping mouth for a threat display, often followed by a lunging motion.

=== Coloration and camouflage ===
Many lizards exhibit an ability to alter the hue and/or intensity of skin color (chameleons are the extreme example), and New Caledonian Geckos are no exception. This phenomenon is facilitated by pigment-containing cells called chromatophores. This is a form of camouflage and can help the gecko blend into their environments. Various factors may contribute to this change in skin color, including the endocrine system or environmental factors such as variations in sunlight and temperature.

==Folklore==
Some of the indigenous Kanak people of New Caledonia fear Leach&#x27;s giant gecko. This is because of an old superstition which purports that it has the ability to cling to a person&#x27;s body and pull out that person&#x27;s soul.

==Conservation status==
Populations of the species &quot;R. leachianus&quot; have likely been reduced by habitat destruction and degradation. This process is still a threat to the species. It also faces predation by introduced species such as cats and various rodents. It is also poached. It can be electrocuted when it travels along power lines. This species is protected and it lives in several nature reserves.

==In captivity==
The New Caledonian giant gecko is occasionally kept as a pet. Individuals in the pet trade are propagated with captive breeding; wild populations are protected. This species may live over 20 years in captivity, with some individuals reaching up to 50 years old. Selective breeding for the pet trade has continued to maintain pure locality &quot;R. leachianus&quot; in captivity&quot;,&quot; with the addition of locality cross-breeding to create desirable phenotypes, such as dramatic coloration, size, and structure.

<text>&quot;The Coming of Shadows&quot; is a key episode from the second season of the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. It won the 1996 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

==Synopsis==
The Centauri Emperor, knowing that he will die soon, makes arrangements to travel to &quot;Babylon 5&quot; to meet with Narn Ambassador G&#x27;Kar in neutral territory and offer a public apology on behalf of the Centauri people for their occupation and enslavement of the Narn homeworld, though this reason is not made public. G&#x27;Kar, on hearing the news of the emperor&#x27;s visit, makes plans to assassinate him, while Centauri Ambassador Londo Mollari and his ally Lord Refa believe that the emperor&#x27;s actions have led to a decline of the Centauri Republic and plan to confront the emperor on this.

The Emperor arrives, meeting the human command staff of the station, and requests a meeting with Vorlon Ambassador Kosh before he leaves the station. A reception for the Emperor is planned, and the attendees are stunned by seeing G&#x27;Kar there. The Emperor collapses before he can make the reception. Dr. Franklin determines the Emperor only has a short time to live, and the Emperor requests that he pass word on to G&#x27;Kar about his planned apology. Dr. Franklin tells this to G&#x27;Kar, who is astonished and humbled by the act.

While the emperor is on his deathbed, Refa urges Londo to take initiative as to sway their supporters on Centauri Prime as to assure Londo will become the next emperor. Londo, against advice of his aide Vir, decides to send a fleet of Centauri warships to a Narn colony on a planet in Quadrant 14. Refa warns the size of the fleet will not be enough to take the planet before he leaves. Privately, Londo tells Vir to contact Mr. Morden, the human spokesman for the Shadows, and to arrange for the Shadows to attack the colony before the Centauri ships arrive. Vir follows the orders, but tells Londo he will regret this decision. Later, G&#x27;Kar offers to buy Londo a drink in light of the emperor&#x27;s apology, unaware of Londo&#x27;s recent action.

The Narn colony is attacked by the Shadows and rendered defenseless. The Centauri ships arrive, which are shortly seen by Narn fighters investigating the attack. Word is relayed to the Narn homeworld, and soon across the system, that the Centauri have taken their colony.

Kosh meets with the Emperor, and tells him that the situation will end &quot;&quot;. With the Emperor near death, Refa and Londo meet him at his deathbed. The Emperor whispers something in Londo&#x27;s ear before he dies. Londo states that the Emperor approved of the attack on the Narn colony, and that he wants Refa and Londo to carry his people &quot;back to the stars&quot;. In private Londo tells Refa that the Emperor told him they were both damned, but Refa shrugs it off as &quot;a small price to pay for immortality&quot;. G&#x27;Kar learns of the attack and attempts to kill Londo before he is restrained by security forces. At the council chambers, Sheridan fails to convince Mollari to return the Narn colonists to their homeworld. G&#x27;Kar announces that the Narn government is formally at war with the Centauri.

A second plotline involves a mysterious man who has been following Chief Garibaldi around. When Garibaldi confronts and arrests him, the man gives him a recorded message from Jeffrey Sinclair, the Earth Alliance Ambassador to Minbar. Sinclair tells Garibaldi that a &quot;terrible darkness&quot; is coming and that he has become involved with a military force called the &quot;Rangers&quot; to fight it. Garibaldi agrees to allow the Rangers to operate on the station and to keep their presence a secret, even from Sheridan. In return Garibaldi asks the Rangers to provide him with information they learn which could affect the station&#x27;s security, to which the Ranger agrees. Delenn is also given a recorded message by the Ranger.

== Production ==
The 1996 Hugo was won in part due to &quot;campaigning&quot; which was in part done online. Straczynski believes that the series failed to gain a 1995 Hugo nomination due to &quot;too many solid episodes&quot; causing a split.

== Reception ==
Entertainment and news website Geek.com included &quot;The Coming of Shadows&quot; as &quot;essential watching&quot; for season two. Geek.com writer Graham Templeton wrote that &quot;one of my personal favorites, this is another pure-plot episode. Its kicks the real-war parallels into high gear, and begins to darken its view of human (and alien) nature significantly.&quot;

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called &quot;The Coming of Shadows&quot; the &quot;defining episode&quot; of the show.

== Bibliography ==

=== The Symphony of Ages ===
The Symphony of Ages books series consists of the &quot;Rhapsody Trilogy&quot;, the two &quot;Middle Books&quot;, and, as of June 2015, &quot;The War of the Known World Trilogy&quot;. The third book in this trilogy, and thus the eighth in the Symphony of Ages series, was published in June 2015.

==== The Rhapsody Trilogy ====
The Rhapsody Trilogy is based on three characters who find themselves in a land on the brink of disaster. Rhapsody, the main character, is a Namer, a profession that includes passing down the history and lore of the people and the land. As a Namer, Rhapsody, can only speak the truth. A Namer has incredible power because when they speak (or sing) they describe the very nature or essence of a person or a thing. In some instances a Namer can change the parameters of a person or a thing by giving it a new name. When Rhapsody meets up with her two future companions she accidentally uses her Naming power to rename The Brother, a ruthless assassin, to &quot;Achmed The Snake.&quot; This accident forces Rhapsody to join Achmed and his companion who are on the run from an ancient and dangerous foe, a F&#x27;Dor demon.

<text>In computer science, type conversion, type casting, type coercion, and type juggling are different ways of changing an expression from one data type to another. An example would be the conversion of an integer value into a floating point value or its textual representation as a string, and vice versa. Type conversions can take advantage of certain features of type hierarchies or data representations. Two important aspects of a type conversion are whether it happens &quot;implicitly&quot; (automatically) or &quot;explicitly&quot;, and whether the underlying data representation is converted from one representation into another, or a given representation is merely &quot;reinterpreted&quot; as the representation of another data type. In general, both primitive and compound data types can be converted.

Each programming language has its own rules on how types can be converted. Languages with strong typing typically do little implicit conversion and discourage the reinterpretation of representations, while languages with weak typing perform many implicit conversions between data types. Weak typing language often allow forcing the compiler to arbitrarily interpret a data item as having different representations—this can be a non-obvious programming error, or a technical method to directly deal with underlying hardware.

In most languages, the word &quot;coercion&quot; is used to denote an &quot;implicit&quot; conversion, either during compilation or during run time. For example, in an expression mixing integer and floating point numbers (like 5 + 0.1), the compiler will automatically convert integer representation into floating point representation so fractions are not lost. Explicit type conversions are either indicated by writing additional code (e.g. adding type identifiers or calling built-in routines) or by coding conversion routines for the compiler to use when it otherwise would halt with a type mismatch.

In most ALGOL-like languages, such as Pascal, Modula-2, Ada and Delphi, &quot;conversion&quot; and &quot;casting&quot; are distinctly different concepts. In these languages, &quot;conversion&quot; refers to either implicitly or explicitly changing a value from one data type storage format to another, e.g. a 16-bit integer to a 32-bit integer. The storage needs may change as a result of the conversion, including a possible loss of precision or truncation. The word &quot;cast&quot;, on the other hand, refers to explicitly changing the &quot;interpretation&quot; of the &quot;bit pattern&quot; representing a value from one type to another. For example, 32 contiguous bits may be treated as an array of 32 Booleans, a 4-byte string, an unsigned 32-bit integer or an IEEE single precision floating point value. Because the stored bits are never changed, the programmer must know low level details such as representation format, byte order, and alignment needs, to meaningfully cast.

In the C family of languages and ALGOL 68, the word &quot;cast&quot; typically refers to an &quot;explicit&quot; type conversion (as opposed to an implicit conversion), causing some ambiguity about whether this is a re-interpretation of a bit-pattern or a real data representation conversion. More important is the multitude of ways and rules that apply to what data type (or class) is located by a pointer and how a pointer may be adjusted by the compiler in cases like object (class) inheritance.

== Explicit casting in various languages ==

=== Ada ===
Ada provides a generic library function Unchecked_Conversion.

===C-like languages===

====Implicit type conversion====
Implicit type conversion, also known as &quot;coercion&quot; or &quot;type juggling&quot;, is an automatic type conversion by the compiler. Some programming languages allow compilers to provide coercion; others require it.

In a mixed-type expression, data of one or more subtypes can be converted to a supertype as needed at runtime so that the program will run correctly. For example, the following is legal C language code:
double d;
long l;
int i;

if (d &gt; i) d = i;
if (i &gt; l) l = i;
if (d == l) d *= 2;
Although , , and belong to different data types, they will be automatically converted to equal data types each time a comparison or assignment is executed. This behavior should be used with caution, as unintended consequences can arise. Data can be lost when converting representations from floating-point to integer, as the fractional components of the floating-point values will be truncated (rounded toward zero). Conversely, precision can be lost when converting representations from integer to floating-point, since a floating-point type may be unable to exactly represent all possible values of some integer type. For example, might be an IEEE 754 single precision type, which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly, while a 32-bit integer type can. This can lead to unintuitive behavior, as demonstrated by the following code:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
 int i_value = 16777217;
 float f_value = 16777216.0;
 printf(&quot;The integer is: %d\n&quot;, i_value);
 printf(&quot;The float is: %f\n&quot;, f_value);
 printf(&quot;Their equality: %d\n&quot;, i_value == f_value);


On compilers that implement floats as IEEE single precision, and ints as at least 32 bits, this code will give this peculiar print-out:

 The integer is: 16777217
 The float is: 16777216.000000
 Their equality: 1

Note that 1 represents equality in the last line above. This odd behavior is caused by an implicit conversion of to float when it is compared with . The conversion causes loss of precision, which makes the values equal before the comparison.

Important takeaways:

# to causes truncation, i.e., removal of the fractional part.
# to causes rounding of digit.
# to causes dropping of excess higher order bits.

=====Type promotion=====
One special case of implicit type conversion is type promotion, where an object is automatically converted into another data type representing a superset of the original type. Promotions are commonly used with types smaller than the native type of the target platform&#x27;s arithmetic logic unit (ALU), before arithmetic and logical operations, to make such operations possible, or more efficient if the ALU can work with more than one type. C and C++ perform such promotion for objects of Boolean, character, wide character, enumeration, and short integer types which are promoted to int, and for objects of type float, which are promoted to double. Unlike some other type conversions, promotions never lose precision or modify the value stored in the object.

In Java:

int x = 3;
double y = 3.5;
System.out.println(x + y); // The output will be 6.5
====Explicit type conversion====
Explicit type conversion, also called type casting, is a type conversion which is explicitly defined within a program (instead of being done automatically according to the rules of the language for implicit type conversion). It is requested by the user in the program.
double da = 3.3;
double db = 3.3;
double dc = 3.4;
int result = (int)da + (int)db + (int)dc; // result == 9
// if implicit conversion would be used (as with &quot;result = da + db + dc&quot;), result would be equal to 10
There are several kinds of explicit conversion.

; checked: Before the conversion is performed, a runtime check is done to see if the destination type can hold the source value. If not, an error condition is raised.
; unchecked: No check is performed. If the destination type cannot hold the source value, the result is undefined.
; bit pattern: The raw bit representation of the source is copied verbatim, and it is re-interpreted according to the destination type. This can also be achieved via aliasing.

In object-oriented programming languages, objects can also be downcast : a reference of a base class is cast to one of its derived classes.

===C# and C++===
In C#, type conversion can be made in a safe or unsafe (i.e., C-like) manner, the former called &quot;checked type cast&quot;.
Animal animal = new Cat();

Bulldog b = (Bulldog) animal; // if (animal is Bulldog), stat.type(animal) is Bulldog, else an exception
b = animal as Bulldog; // if (animal is Bulldog), b = (Bulldog) animal, else b = null

animal = null;
b = animal as Bulldog; // b == null
In C++ a similar effect can be achieved using &quot;C++-style cast syntax&quot;.
Animal* animal = new Cat;

Bulldog* b = static_cast&lt;Bulldog*&gt;(animal); // compiles only if either Animal or Bulldog is derived from the other (or same)
b = dynamic_cast&lt;Bulldog*&gt;(animal); // if (animal is Bulldog), b = (Bulldog*) animal, else b = nullptr

Bulldog&amp; br = static_cast&lt;Bulldog&amp;&gt;(*animal); // same as above, but an exception will be thrown if a nullptr was to be returned
 // this is not seen in code where exception handling is avoided

delete animal; // always free resources
animal = nullptr;
b = dynamic_cast&lt;Bulldog*&gt;(animal); // b == nullptr
===Eiffel===

In Eiffel the notion of type conversion is integrated into the rules of the type system. The Assignment Rule says that an assignment, such as:

x := y

is valid if and only if the type of its source expression, codice_1 in this case, is &quot;compatible with&quot; the type of its target entity, codice_2 in this case. In this rule, &quot;compatible with&quot; means that the type of the source expression either &quot;conforms to&quot; or &quot;converts to&quot; that of the target. Conformance of types is defined by the familiar rules for polymorphism in object-oriented programming. For example, in the assignment above, the type of codice_1 conforms to the type of codice_2 if the class upon which codice_1 is based is a descendant of that upon which codice_2 is based.

====Definition of type conversion in Eiffel====
The actions of type conversion in Eiffel, specifically &quot;converts to&quot; and &quot;converts from&quot; are defined as:
A type based on a class CU &quot;converts to&quot; a type T based on a class CT (and T &quot;converts from&quot; U) if either
:CT has a &quot;conversion procedure&quot; using U as a conversion type, or
:CU has a &quot;conversion query&quot; listing T as a conversion type
====Example====

Eiffel is a fully compliant language for Microsoft .NET Framework. Before development of .NET, Eiffel already had extensive class libraries. Using the .NET type libraries, particularly with commonly used types such as strings, poses a conversion problem. Existing Eiffel software uses the string classes (such as codice_7) from the Eiffel libraries, but Eiffel software written for .NET must use the .NET string class (codice_8) in many cases, for example when calling .NET methods which expect items of the .NET type to be passed as arguments. So, the conversion of these types back and forth needs to be as seamless as possible.
 my_string: STRING_8 -- Native Eiffel string
 my_system_string: SYSTEM_STRING -- Native .NET string

 my_string := my_system_string
In the code above, two strings are declared, one of each different type (codice_9 is the Eiffel compliant alias for System.String). Because codice_8 does not conform to codice_7, then the assignment above is valid only if codice_8 converts to codice_7.

The Eiffel class codice_7 has a conversion procedure codice_15 for objects of type codice_8. Conversion procedures are also always designated as creation procedures (similar to constructors). The following is an excerpt from the codice_7 class:
 class STRING_8
 create
 make_from_cil
 convert
 make_from_cil ({SYSTEM_STRING})


The presence of the conversion procedure makes the assignment:
 my_string := my_system_string
semantically equivalent to:
 create my_string.make_from_cil (my_system_string)
in which codice_18 is constructed as a new object of type codice_7 with content equivalent to that of codice_20.

To handle an assignment with original source and target reversed:
 my_system_string := my_string
the class codice_7 also contains a conversion query codice_22 which will produce a codice_8 from an instance of codice_7.
 class STRING_8
 create
 make_from_cil
 convert
 make_from_cil ({SYSTEM_STRING})
 to_cil: {SYSTEM_STRING}


The assignment:
 my_system_string := my_string
then, becomes equivalent to:
 my_system_string := my_string.to_cil
In Eiffel, the setup for type conversion is included in the class code, but then appears to happen as automatically as explicit type conversion in client code. The includes not just assignments but other types of attachments as well, such as argument (parameter) substitution.

===Rust===
Rust provides no implicit type conversion (coercion) between primitive types. But, explicit type conversion (casting) can be performed using the codice_25 keyword.

let x = 1000;
println!(&quot;1000 as a u16 is: {}&quot;, x as u16);
== Type assertion ==
A related concept in static type systems is called type assertion, which instruct the compiler to treat the expression of a certain type, disregarding its own inference. Type assertion may be safe (a runtime check is performed) or unsafe. A type assertion does not convert the value from a data type to another.

=== TypeScript ===
In TypeScript, a type assertion is done by using the codice_25 keyword:
const myCanvas = document.getElementById(&quot;main_canvas&quot;) as HTMLCanvasElement;
In the above example, codice_27 is declared to return an codice_28, but you know that it always return an codice_29, which is a subtype of codice_28, in this case. If it is not the case, subsequent code which relies on the behaviour of codice_29 will not perform correctly, as in Typescript there is no runtime checking for type assertions.

In Typescript, there is no general way to check if a value is of a certain type at runtime, as there is no runtime type support. However, it is possible to write a user-defined function which the user tells the compiler if a value is of a certain type of not. Such a function is called type guard, and is declared with a return type of codice_32, where codice_33 is a parameter or codice_34, in place of codice_35.

This allows unsafe type assertions to be contained in the checker function instead of littered around the codebase.

=== Go ===
In Go, a type assertion can be used to access a concrete type value from an interface value. It is a safe assertion that it will panic (in the case of one return value), or return a zero value (if two return values are used), if the value is not of that concrete type.

t := i.(T)
This type assertions tell the system that codice_36 is of type codice_37. If it isn&#x27;t, it panics.

== Implicit casting using untagged unions ==
Many programming languages support union types which can hold a value of multiple types. &quot;Untagged&quot; unions are provided in some languages with loose type-checking, such as C and PL/I, but also in the original Pascal. These can be used to interpret the bit pattern of one type as a value of another type.

==Security issues==
In hacking, typecasting is the misuse of type conversion to temporarily change a variable&#x27;s data type from how it was originally defined. This provides opportunities for hackers since in type conversion after a variable is &quot;typecast&quot; to become a different data type, the compiler will treat that hacked variable as the new data type for that specific operation.

<doc id="555396" wikidata="Q535525" url="?curid=555396" title="The Man-Machine">
<text>The Man-Machine () is the seventh studio album by German electronic music band Kraftwerk. It was released on 28 April 1978 by Kling Klang in Germany and by Capitol Records elsewhere. A further refinement of their mechanical style, the album saw the group incorporate more danceable rhythms. The album has a satirical bent to it. It is thought to address a wide-range of themes from the Cold War, Germany&#x27;s fascination with manufacturing, and humankind&#x27;s increasingly symbiotic relationship with machines. It includes the singles &quot;The Model&quot; and &quot;The Robots&quot;.

Although the album was initially unsuccessful on the UK Albums Chart, it reached a new peak position of number nine in February 1982, becoming the band&#x27;s second highest-peaking album in the United Kingdom after &quot;Autobahn&quot; (1974).

== Artwork ==
The artwork for the cover was produced by Karl Klefisch, based on the work of the Russian suprematist El Lissitzky – the words &quot;Inspired by El Lissitzky&quot; are noted on the cover. The back cover image is an adaptation of a graphic from Lissitzky&#x27;s book for children &quot;About Two Squares: A Suprematist Tale of Two Squares in Six Constructions&quot;.

== Release ==
&quot;The Man-Machine&quot; was released in April 1978. &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 15 February 1982 In October 2009, a remastered edition of the album was released on CD, Vinyl and digital formats by Mute Records, and Astralwerks.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing the album in 1978, Andy Gill of &quot;NME&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;The Man-Machine&quot; stands as one of the pinnacles of rock music&quot;, adding that &quot;the sparsity of the lyrics leaves the emphasis squarely on those robot rhythms, chilling tones and exquisite melodies&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau also reviewed the album that year, saying: &quot;Only a curmudgeon could reject a group that synthesizes the innovations of &quot;Environments&quot; and David Seville &amp; the Chipmunks, not to mention that it&#x27;s better make-out music.&quot; Mitchell Schneider from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found that the &quot;chilling restraint and relentless sameness&quot; of the lyrics and music are tempered by Kraftwerk&#x27;s sense of humour and &quot;sheer audacity&quot;, which makes for a listening experience that is &quot;strangely pleasant in an otherworldly way&quot;.

Tony Clayton wrote in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; which &quot;they constitute the resilient framework of electro-pop and electronica we hear today. And if there are more simple, warm and beautiful pieces of electronic music out there than &#x27;Ohm Sweet Ohm&#x27;, &#x27;Neon Lights&#x27;, &#x27;Europe Endless&#x27; and the title track of &quot;Autobahn&quot;, then this geezer has yet to hear them.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; critic David Cavanagh called &quot;The Model&quot; a &quot;wry pop satire&quot; and wrote that &quot;the sparse lyrics lend themselves to considerable interpretation&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Steve Huey wrote that the album is &quot;less minimalistic in its arrangements and more complex and danceable in its underlying rhythms&quot; than the group&#x27;s previous works, and noted its &quot;tremendous impact&quot; on subsequent synth-pop artists. He also described it as &quot;closer to the sound and style that would define early new wave electro-pop&quot;, and noted its &quot;feel of a divided concept album&quot;, with some songs (such as the title track and &quot;The Robots&quot;) exploring &quot;the science fiction-esque links between humans and technology&quot;, and others (such as &quot;Neon Lights&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot;) celebrating &quot;the glamour of urbanization&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; as the 57th greatest album of all time in 2013, citing it as Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;definitive&quot; album and the catalyst for the synth-pop &quot;revolution&quot; that followed its release. &quot;Paste&quot; ranked it the 11th best album of 1978.

<doc id="555398" wikidata="Q1640788" url="?curid=555398" title="Mia (game)">
<text>Mia is a simple dice game with a strong emphasis on bluffing and detecting bluff related to Liar&#x27;s dice.

==Equipment==
Two dice and either a flat bottomed container with a lid or a dice cup are needed. This game is played by three or more players.

==Play==
All players start with six lives. Usually each player use a separate die to keep track of their lives, counting down from 6 to 1 as they lose lives. The players roll a single die to determine who goes first.

To start a round, the first player (Player A) rolls the dice and checks their throw while keeping the value concealed from the other players in or under the container. That player must end their turn by announcing a value according to one of three choices:

#Lie and announce a greater value than what was rolled.
#Tell the truth and announce the actual value of what has been rolled.
#Lie and announce a lesser value than what was rolled.

There is no required minimum value for the announcement following the first roll of the round. The action then passes to the next player (Player B), usually in a clockwise fashion (i.e., the player to the left), who now must choose one of two options:

This process continues with the next player until the round ends. Note that each player must &quot;always&quot; announce a value greater than the previous value announced, unless they are passed a Mia in which case the round ends with the next player. When &quot;Mia&quot; is announced, the next player has two choices:

#They may give up without looking at the dice and lose one life.
#They may look at the dice. If it was a Mia (21), they lose &quot;two&quot; lives. If it wasn&#x27;t, the previous player loses one life as usual.

The first player to lose all of their lives loses the game.

===Example===
Suppose there are four players A, B, C, and D:
* Player A rolls and announces 52, which is fairly easy to beat.
* Without looking, player B shakes the box. When they look inside, they see 43 so they are forced to bluff by announcing 65 and passing on to player C.
* Player C isn&#x27;t sure about the call but 65 is hard to beat so they pass to player D, also announcing 65.
* For the same reasons, player D announces 65 and passes to player A.
* Player A also does not think they can beat 65 and player B looks pretty confident so player A announces 65 and passes it to B, meaning that player B must beat the score they originally announced (65). 
* Since player B is the only person who actually knows what is in the box, they challenge player A, and player A loses a life, since the actual value (43) is less than the last value announced (65).

==Scoring==

Unlike most dice games, the value of the roll is not the sum of the dice. Instead, the highest die is multiplied by ten and then added to the other die. The roll is 21 and is 65. The highest roll is 21 which is called &quot;Mia&quot;, followed by the doubles from 66 to 11, and then all other rolls from 65 down to 31. Thus, the complete order of rolls (from highest to lowest) is 21 (Mia), 66, 55, 44, 33, 22, 11, 65, 64, 63, 62, 61, 54, 53, 52, 51, 43, 42, 41, 32, 31.

== Strategy ==
The appeal of Mia resides primarily in the potential it affords for bluffing. As with other games of bluff, this is partly a psychological challenge. It is important to know the other players and master the subtleties of more or less conscious interpersonal communication. A common strategy is to develop a &quot;character&quot;. A player may, for instance pretend to be a truthful person, a notorious liar, a constantly lucky roller, or one that usually tries to get at players beyond the next player. This will make the actions of the other players more predictable, which will give the player an advantage.

It is, however, also about statistics. In total, there are 36 possible throw combinations with two dice; however, there are only 21 possible results in this game. There are two ways to achieve any result with two different numbers; for example, a result of 43 can be achieved by rolling either or ; on the other hand, doubles can only be made in one way.

As an example, consider the roll 55. There are two rolls ranked above this (21 and 66), and so the probability that any single subsequent roll would beat 55 is the sum of the probability of rolling 21, which is , or rolling 66, which is . Therefore the probability of beating 55 outright on a subsequent roll is or %. To compute the probability of losing to 55, the possibility of a tie must be included, that is, adding the probability of rolling 55, which is again . The total probability of beating &quot;or&quot; tying 55 on a subsequent roll is or %, and consequently the probability of losing to 55 (i.e., neither beating nor tying) on a subsequent roll is 1– or %.

Because of the disparity in probabilities to roll doubles compared to mixed numbers, the median roll in this game is &quot;54&quot;, which means that on average, any single roll has an equal chance of being above or below a roll of 54. Players should be aware that 54 is the &quot;middle&quot; roll, in the sense that if a player announces 54, there is a 50% chance that the next player will roll a better value. In the Danish version called Meyer, the equivalent middle roll is 61, as the &quot;little Meyer&quot; (31) roll is ranked above the doubles.

Note that &quot;62&quot; is positioned in the middle of the possible results table, with ten possible results above and below 62. In comparison, there are twelve possible results above and eight below 54. The likelihood that someone rolling a 62 (the numeric median result) will be beaten by a subsequent roller is only about 39 percent, while someone rolling a 54 (the statistical, or actual, median result) is facing exactly even odds.

==Variations==
The game is also known as Kuriki, Kariki, Meyer, Meier, or Mire. Because the gameplay been passed down orally, many variations and house rules exist.

Ian MacKaye named his band Coriky after the game, which the band states is popular among Washington, DC-area punk bands on tour. Steve Albini wrote that his band, Shellac, learned it from Fugazi, who in turn learned it from Citizen Fish.

===Scoring variations===
* 31 may be considered the 2nd best roll (called &quot;little Mia&quot;) instead of the worst, and 32 (called &quot;joker&quot;) may also be assigned special functions.
* The order of the rolls 66 to 11 may be reversed.
* The rolls from 31 to 65 might be represented by just stating the sum of the two dice, so that e.g. both 62 and 53 are called &quot;8 pips&quot; and have the same value, better than &quot;7 pips&quot; (including 61) but worse than &quot;9 pips&quot; (including 54). In this case, the probability to beat the 11-pip and 10-pip scores are the same as 65 and 64, respectively, as they have 2 ways to form each since the double-5 is scored separately and not counted, followed by 9-pip (4 ways to form, % to beat), 8-pip (4 ways to form as double-4 is not counted, % to beat), 7-pip (6 ways to form, % to beat), 6-pip (4 ways to form as double-3 is not counted, % to beat), 5-pip (4 ways to form, % to beat), and 4-pip (2 ways to form as double-2 is not counted, % to beat, same as 31).

===Gameplay variations===
* The penalty whenever Mia is involved may be doubled so that one loses two lives instead of one.
* The requirement that one must announce more than the previous player can be relaxed so that one just has to announce at least the same, but then, the option of passing on the dice without looking would be banned.
* It can also be played that the dice roll &quot;must&quot; be beaten, ensuring drama for a Mia.
* A drinking game variation may be played, whereby instead of a life, a finger/swig may be imbibed instead. Typically Mia is accompanied by a &#x27;stiff&#x27; penalty also, for example, a whole drink.

<doc id="555406" wikidata="Q48781707" url="?curid=555406" title="Hourman">
<text>Hourman or Hour-Man is the name of three different fictional superheroes appearing in comics published by DC Comics. The original Hourman was created by writer Ken Fitch and artist Bernard Baily in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #48 (March 1940), during the Golden Age of Comic Books. The first Hourman is chemist Rex Tyler, who creates a new synthesis, &quot;Miraclo&quot;, which grants him super-strength and endurance, but only for one hour.

Rex Tyler made his live action debut in the season one finale of The CW series &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; portrayed by Patrick J. Adams. Both Rex and Rick Tyler also appear in the DC Universe series &quot;Stargirl&quot; portrayed by Lou Ferrigno Jr. and Cameron Gellman respectively.

==Fictional character biography==
===Rex Tyler===

The original Hourman is Rex Tyler who appeared in the Golden Age of Comic Books and is a founding member of the Justice Society of America.

===Rick Tyler===

Rick Tyler, Rex&#x27;s son, took over the Hourman mantle during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. Rick swallowed some of his father&#x27;s Miraclo pills to help him save people trapped in a burning hospital. After serving for a few years as a member of Infinity, Inc., a team composed largely of other JSA-member children, Rick began to grow addicted to Miraclo just as his father did. He spent many years after leaving the group critically ill until Amazo, posing as a future incarnation of the android Hourman, cured him of his Miraclo addiction. Having conquered his personal demons and regaining his health, Rick joined the JSA in its incarnation as a small band of freedom fighters during the &quot;Stealing Thunder&quot; arc. The android had given him an hourglass full of tachyons that gave Rick random visions one hour into the future. As a second gift, Rick could visit with his father in an otherworldly dimension called the Timepoint, frozen in time, just before Rex&#x27;s death. At one point, Rick is severely injured in battle, and switched places with his father to save his life. Tyler, the android known as the third Hourman, took Rex and some other JSA members to the Timepoint to save Rick&#x27;s life. The one hour Rex was allotted in the Timepoint expired just as Doctor Mid-Nite and Tyler had healed Rick of his injuries. Father and son fought over who would perish in the battle with Extant. Ultimately, Tyler the android took Rex&#x27;s place and was destroyed when Rick and Rex returned to Earth. Rick is once again active as Hourman and is an active member of the JSA. He is married to Jesse Chambers.

===Matthew Tyler===

In the 853rd century another Hourman, an android that was modeled on Rex Tyler&#x27;s DNA, served with both the Justice League and the Justice Society for a time. He often perceived himself as Rex and also as Rex&#x27;s descendant. Originally possessing the time-manipulating cosmic artifact known as the Worlogog, he divested himself of most of its power at the suggestion of Snapper Carr and went about learning to be human. After failing to stop Extant from escaping a fight, Hourman quit the JSA and began travelling through the timestream, returning when he received a distress call from the JSA. As noted above, he is believed to have been destroyed at the hands of Extant in Rex&#x27;s place, although the time-traveler Rip Hunter mentioned that his actions would leave him inactive for a relative year, indicating his probable return. Before he died, the android also gave his hourglass to Rex Tyler, who hopes to rebuild him. The android briefly used the alias Matthew Tyler and was often simply called Tyler.

==Powers and abilities==
Neither Rex nor Rick have any innate powers (though it was once theorized that their powers derive from a metagene, like many DC superheroes). Any superhuman abilities they display are derived from the use of Miraclo. Taking Miraclo grants a user several abilities for the span of an hour. Most obvious are the superhuman strength, durability, increased resistance to physical damage (to the extent of being impervious to small arms fire) and speed enhancements. Other, lesser known and mentioned powers include night vision and the ability to survive underwater. Rex and Rick both took Miraclo in pill form, but Rick later changed to using a transdermal patch.

The amount of Miraclo that can be taken per day has varied. Normally, it is once a day, but in some instances, Rex has been shown taking another pill as soon as an &quot;Hour of Power&quot; runs out. One story states that Rex needed to wait another hour after the Miraclo wore off before taking another dose. Miraclo works specifically on the Tylers and may or may not work on others who take it. In one instance it worked on an animal, Dr. Mid-Nite&#x27;s owl Hootie, as well as the villain Bane.

Rex and Rick both wore an hourglass around their necks given to them by the Hourman Android. It was filled with energized tachyons, time in its most basic form. It gives Rick &quot;time vision&quot;, flashes of events that will happen exactly one hour later as well as the ability to touch those out of phase with normal time. The latter effect comes to anyone holding the hourglass. Rex displayed neither of these abilities.

&quot;Tyler&quot; is often simply called an android, but is actually an intelligent machine colony (possibly a form of nanotechnology) created by Tylerco in the far future. If damaged, this colony can effortlessly multiply and repair. His software is encoded with the genetics of Rex Tyler, giving him all of Rex&#x27;s memories. He originally possessed the Worlogog, which gave him complete control over time. He later gave all but a shard of it up, but not before he absorbed all of Batman&#x27;s memories of the JLA.

Though not as powerful as he was originally, Tyler still retained super strength, durability, and speed equivalent to a person using Miraclo. He was able to access an &quot;Hour of Power&quot;, sixty minutes during which he had power over time. He can do many things with this control: move between picoseconds, travel through time, use his own time vision (which allows him to see a person&#x27;s past and future, as well as their age) or make people and things younger, slow a person down until essentially frozen, create tunnels between different time periods, and share power with other individuals (though the amount of time that he provides them power for directly takes away from his sixty minutes). Tyler activates the Hour of Power at will and the hourglass on his chest keeps count of the time. There seems to be some doubt how often he can use his Hour of Power. Like the other Hourmans&#x27; use of Miraclo, sometimes Tyler is said to only have one Hour of Power a day, while at other times he simply must wait another hour to recharge before he can reactivate, and it is unclear if he must use that Hour of Power in one go or if he can spread it out over the course of the day.

Tyler also has a timeship that he can summon from the timestream. It is connected to him and reacts to his thoughts. It normally appears as a Viking-style wooden sailing ship adorned with clocks, but it can change form as Tyler dictates to anything from a simple wooden skiff to a futuristic spaceship and also be used as a weapon, as when Hourman made a large hand out of it to trap Extant. The ship can travel through time, to alternate timelines, or through hypertime.

<doc id="555407" wikidata="Q3278906" url="?curid=555407" title="Ooh La La (Faces album)">
<text>Ooh La La is the fourth and final studio album by the English rock band Faces, released in March 1973. It reached number one in the UK Albums Chart in the week of 28 April 1973. The album was most recently reissued on CD in a remastered and expanded form on 28 August 2015, including early rehearsal takes of three of its tracks, as part of the &quot;1970–1975: You Can Make Me Dance, Sing Or Anything...&quot; box set (along with the rest of the Faces catalogue of studio recordings). The box set&#x27;s vinyl counterpart did not contain any bonus tracks, but it did replicate the original LP artwork and &#x27;animated&#x27; cover.

==Background and recording==
By the end of 1972, following the critical and commercial successes of Rod Stewart&#x27;s solo albums, the singer had become increasingly distanced from some of his Faces bandmates, who were frustrated that by this point they had come to be perceived by the public (and even by some concert promoters) as little more than Stewart&#x27;s backing band for live work. Stewart himself was reportedly distracted enough by his newfound stardom that he missed the first two weeks of recording sessions for the latest Faces album entirely. The rest of the band used the studio time to rehearse and record a plethora of instrumentals and backing tracks, including material that would eventually appear on Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood&#x27;s side project Mahoney&#x27;s Last Stand. 

The production of the album would continue to be hampered by Stewart&#x27;s apparent lack of commitment to the project, and as a result of this situation, &quot;Ooh La La&quot; was, according to Ian McLagan, &quot;Ronnie [Lane]&#x27;s album&quot;. Lane embraced the opportunity to expand his songwriting role in the band and his increased contribution set the tone of the album&#x27;s quieter, more reflective second side.

Despite the difficult circumstances of the recording sessions, producer Glyn Johns held the group together, helping to placate internal tensions; his efforts enabled the Faces to record a focused, concise album in the manner of its predecessor, &quot;A Nod Is As Good As a Wink... to a Blind Horse&quot; (the band&#x27;s first two albums were, by contrast, lengthier self-produced records). Once the recording of &quot;Ooh La La&quot; was completed, the album&#x27;s credits optimistically suggested an intention to work with Johns again in the future, with the comment: &quot;Produced by Glyn Johns (see you in a year)&quot;.

==Musical content==
Stewart&#x27;s compositions for the album were written mostly in tandem with Wood and McLagan, although – in a departure from the norm – two more songs were written by Stewart in sole partnership with Lane. One of these, &quot;Flags and Banners&quot;, featured Stewart accompanying Wood on either banjo or a secondary guitar part, while Lane handled vocal duties.

The album included one composition by the whole band (excepting Stewart), the instrumental &quot;Fly in the Ointment&quot;. This was the only joint composition by the four instrumentalists to make it onto any of their studio albums; usually their efforts were relegated to the B-sides of singles – such as &quot;Skewiff (Mend the Fuse)&quot;, which served as B-side to the &quot;Cindy Incidentally&quot; single.

The title track, by Wood and Lane, featured the only solo lead vocal performed in the studio by Wood during the band&#x27;s existence, recorded at Glyn Johns&#x27; suggestion after neither Lane nor Stewart were said to be satisfied with their own attempts at it. Stewart apparently claimed at the time that the song was in the wrong key for him, but he later covered the song on his 1998 album &quot;When We Were the New Boys&quot;, in tribute to the recently deceased Lane. Lane himself later re-recorded the song and regularly performed it live during his own post-Faces solo career.

Two other tracks from the sessions were released at the time; &quot;Skewiff (Mend the Fuse)&quot; as the B-side of &quot;Cindy Incidentally&quot;, and the blues parody &quot;Dishevelment Blues&quot; as the B-side of an album sampler flexi disc that was given away with copies of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; to promote the LP. These two tracks (the latter long-prized by fans as a collector&#x27;s item) were eventually compiled on the &quot;Five Guys Walk into a Bar...&quot; box set in 2004. Five outtakes from the album sessions were also released as part of &quot;Five Guys...&quot;, while a number of other outtakes, mostly instrumentals, have also circulated unofficially among collectors over the years.

==Album cover and artwork==
The cover of the album was designed by Jim Ladwig, around a stylised photograph of &quot;Gastone&quot;, a stage character of 1920s Italian comedian Ettore Petrolini. The original LP&#x27;s Art Deco-inspired cover was constructed in such a way that when the top edge of the sleeve was pressed down, a concealed die-cut design element would descend that made Gastone&#x27;s eyes appear to discolour and move to the side, and his jaw would appear to drop into a leering smile. The back cover also featured art deco-inspired design elements, and detailed song information and album credits alongside tinted individual photographic portraits of the band members. The original gatefold sleeve&#x27;s inner design depicted a large stylised photomontage of the band in typical &#x27;laddish&#x27; pose, admiring the charms of a can-can dancer (referencing the lyric of the title track).

The 2015 vinyl reissue (part of the &quot;1970–1975: You Can Make Me Dance, Sing Or Anything...&quot; box set) replicated the original LP artwork, including the animated picture of Gastone.

==Subsequent events==
Shortly after &quot;Ooh La La&quot;″s March 1973 release, Stewart reported to the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; that he felt that the LP was a &quot;stinking rotten album&quot;. He expounded further in the pages of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, stating that the album was &quot;A bloody mess. But I shouldn&#x27;t say that, should I? Well, I should say it in a few weeks&#x27; time. Not now. I mean, the public ain&#x27;t gonna like me saying it&#x27;s a bloody mess. It was a disgrace. Maybe I&#x27;m too critical. But look, I don&#x27;t like it ... All that fucking about taking nine months [sic] to do an album like &#x27;Ooh La La&#x27; doesn&#x27;t prove anything. But I&#x27;m not going to say anything more about it.&quot; Shortly afterwards, striking a rather more considered tone in an apparent attempt at damage limitation, Stewart told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine that what he had actually meant to say was that the group was &quot;capable of doing a better album than we&#x27;ve done. I just don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve found the right studios, or the right formula&quot;.

Despite Stewart&#x27;s misgivings, the album reached number one in the UK Albums Chart during April, knocking Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; off the top spot, and being the only Faces record to achieve that distinction. Rather than celebrate this success, however, the rest of the group were dismayed by the harshness of Stewart&#x27;s comments, especially considering his perceived lack of commitment to fully participate in the album&#x27;s recording. In his 2000 autobiography &quot;All the Rage&quot;, Ian McLagan wrote: &quot;The week the album came out he did all he could to scuttle it and told anyone who would listen how useless it was&quot;.

Ronnie Lane, having assumed the creative workload due to Stewart&#x27;s apparent lack of interest, was especially stung by the vocalist&#x27;s public criticism. No longer content with the prospect of being increasingly sidelined in the band that he had originally co-founded, Lane left the Faces early in June, a decision that he would reportedly later regret. His role as bassist (but perhaps tellingly, not his role as secondary composer or vocalist) was filled shortly thereafter by former Free bassist Tetsu Yamauchi. 

Faces released two further singles (in 1973 and 1974 respectively), but while they toured extensively over the next two-and-a-half years, without Lane the necessary impetus for the band to record another full album of studio material seemed to have evaporated (aside from a brief and abortive attempt early in 1975). The group eventually ground to a halt in November 1975 as Stewart seemed to lose interest in them entirely, while guitarist Ronnie Wood toured with the Rolling Stones prior to his official enlistment as Mick Taylor&#x27;s replacement. For the remainder of the 1970s Lane went on to a more creatively fulfilling but financially unrewarding solo career, while Jones and McLagan reunited with Steve Marriott in a reformation of the Small Faces (which also briefly included Lane at the initial sessions).

== Legacy ==
The album&#x27;s title track &quot;Ooh La La&quot; is featured at the end of Wes Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;Rushmore&quot; (1998), in the comedy film &quot;Without a Paddle&quot; (2004), and in numerous commercial and television soundtracks released since the year 2000. The song &quot;Glad and Sorry&quot; is featured in the films &quot;Blow&quot; (2001) and &quot;I&#x27;m Your Woman&quot; (2020).

<doc id="555422" wikidata="Q302687" url="?curid=555422" title="Shamarpa">
<text>The Shamarpa (; literally, &quot;Person (i.e. Holder) of the Red Crown&quot;), also known as &quot;Shamar Rinpoche&quot;, or more formally Künzig Shamar Rinpoche, is the second-oldest lineage of tulkus (reincarnated lamas). He is one of the highest lineage holders of the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism and is regarded as the mind manifestation of Amitābha. He is traditionally associated with Yangpachen Monastery near Lhasa.

The first Shamarpa, Drakpa Senggé (, 1283–1349), received the title &quot;Shamarpa&quot;, and a red crown, an exact replica of Karmapa’s black crown from Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa, establishing the second line of reincarnate lamas in Tibetan Buddhism. The Karmapa was the first.

The Shamarpa is often referred to as the &quot;Red Hat Karmapa&quot;, especially in early Kagyu texts.

The 5th Dalai Lama saw the Shamarpa as equal to the Karmapa: 

==The Shamarpa lineage==

Shamarpa considered to be successive reincarnations are listed in &quot;The Garland of Moon Water Crystal&quot; by the 8th Tai Situpa Chökyi Jungne and Belo Tsewang Künkhyab.


# Khedrup Drakpa Senge (1284–1349) was the principal disciple of the 3rd Karmapa. The Good Kalpa Sutra predicted that, &quot;in the future, a maha-bodhisattva with a ruby-red crown shall come to the suffering multitude, leading them out of their cyclic bewilderment and misery.&quot; It is a common belief among Karma Kagyus that Buddha Shakyamuni’s prediction was fulfilled in the appearance of the Shamarpa, whose ruby red crown was presented by the 3rd Karmapa to the first Shamarpa, Khedrup Drakpa Senge. In addition the 2nd Karmapa, Karma Pakshi, predicted that &quot;future Karmapas shall manifest in two Nirmanakaya forms.&quot; The ruby-red crown is an exact replica of Karmapa’s black crown (apart from the color). In this manner it was meant to symbolize the identicalness of the Shamarpas and the Karmapas. The first Shamarpa spent the last 20 years of his life in retreat at Tsurphu and Nenang Monasteries teaching students dedicated to attaining enlightenment.
# Shamar Khachö Wangpo (1350–1405) was recognized by the 4th Karmapa. Having been the student and main lineage holder of the Fourth Karmapa, he passed on the esoteric instructions of the Karma Kagyu tradition to the 5th Karmapa. His Collected Works comprise seven volumes in which he covers a broad range of subjects of the philosophical and meditative training as transmitted in the Kagyu tradition. Just half of these works have survived until today
# Shamar Chöpal Yeshe (1406–1452). Chöpal Yeshe is renowned for having constructed several monasteries and retreat-centers. He was also able to abolish the practice of animal sacrifice in the regions of Tibet where that custom had continued as a part of animist rituals. The 3rd Shamarpa was given the Kagyu transmission and full authorization to teach by the 5th Karmapa. The Yongle Emperor of China, who was also a student of the 5th Karmapa, was intrigued by Shamarpa’s ability to recall past lives in vivid detail. Out of devotion, he gave precious gifts to the Shamarpa. In a letter of thanks Shamarpa reminded the emperor of the basic principle of benevolence in Buddhism, that he might be ever mindful of the well-being of his people. The third Shamarpa also enthroned the sixth Karmapa and gave him his first traditional teachings.
# Shamar Chokyi Drakpa Yeshe Pal Zangpo (1453–1526) was recognized by the 7th Karmapa, who became his Lama. The famous Tibetan monastery Ga Mamo Tashi Rabten was founded by him. He also established many smaller monasteries. During his travels outside Tibet, Chökyi Tragpa built many monasteries, among others there are four monasteries in Bhutan and he was the first of the Shamar reincarnates to visit Nepal where he built a small monastery in Swayambhunath, one of the country&#x27;s most sacred places. Upon returning to his home-land, he acted as the king of Tibet for a period of twelve years and he ruled the country on the basis of strict adherence to Buddhist principles.
# Shamar Köncho Yenlak (1526–1583) was identified by the 8th Karmapa at the age of 2 and became one of his most outstanding students. Shamarpa stayed with the Karmapa until the age of twelve, receiving the Six Yogas of Naropa, Mahamudra, and other teachings of the Kagyu lineage. The 8th Karmapa entrusted the 5th Shamarpa with the letters containing the prediction of his next rebirth. The 5th Shamarpa also recognized and became the Lama of the 9th Karmapa, giving him refuge and the Bodhisattva promise, ordination, as well as transmissions on various texts and meditations—including the texts and tantric meditations of the Kagyu lineage.
# Shamar Mipan Chökyi Wangchuk (1584–1629) was recognized by the 9th Karmapa who was his main Lama. cf https://www.tbrc.org/#!rid=P1432
# Shamar Yeshe Nyinpo (1631–1694) was recognized by the 10th Karmapa, and he became the Karmapa&#x27;s disciple.
# Palchen Chökyi Döndrup (1695–1732) was born in Yilmo, Nepal and was taken to Tibet at age 7. He received teachings and instructions from the 11th Karmapa before his death. The Shamarpa in turn, recognized and enthroned 12th Karmapa as the 12th Karmapa and acted as his Root-guru.
# Könchog Geway Jungnay (1733–1741) was born in Paro in Bhutan, and was discovered by the 13th Karmapa, but lived only until age nine 
# Mipam Chödrup Gyamtso (1742–1793) was the stepbrother of the 6th Panchen Lama, Lobsang Palden Yeshe (1738–1780). He was taught primarily by the eight Tai Situ Rinpoche, and also recognized the ninth Tai Situ Rinpoche. Shamar Tulku spent many years reviving the Dharma in Tibet. In particular, Shamar Tulku attempted to bring the Kagyu teachings to central Tibet, which was a stronghold of Gelugpa-allied political elements at the time, with the help of his brother the 6th Panchen Lama of the Gelugpa lineage. After carrying out this activity Shamarpa went on pilgrimage to Nepal. According to some sources, a dispute over his claim to his stepbrother&#x27;s material inheritance led to an armed conflict in which the Shamarpa conspired with the Nepalese Gurkha army in 1788. According to other sources, while Shamarpa was on a pilgrimage to Nepal, fighting broke out between the Nepalese Gurkhas and Tibet. Shamarpa attempted to make peace and mediate in the conflict. In Tibet the influential Gelugpa minister Tagtsag Tenpai Gonpo saw an opportunity to remove a perceived political threat and acquire property. He spread rumors that Shamarpa was instigating the fighting and seized Yang Chen monastery from Shamarpa. The monks were forcibly converted to the Gelug school. Subsequently an order was passed by the government that all of Shamarpa’s monasteries must convert to the Gelug school. This, and other disputes between the Gelug and Kagyu schools led to the exile from Tibet of the Shamarpa and a legal ban by the Tibetan government on further Shamarpa incarnations This ban remained in place until after the Dalai Lama lost power in Tibet during the 1950s, although it was later revealed that the Karmapa had recognized reincarnations of the Shamarpa secretly during the intervening period.
# Unknown, presumed forced into hiding by the Tibetan government.
# Tugsay Jamyang (1895–1947) was the son of the 15th Karmapa. However, it is recorded that he taught and practiced Buddhism as a layman.
# Tinlay Kunchap (1948–1950), an infant who survived only a little over a year
# Mipham Chokyi Lodro (1952–2014) was born in Derge, Tibet and at the age of four he was recognized by the 16th Karmapa. He died on 11 June 2014 in Germany.

==Namling Shamar==

Following the death of the 9th Shamarpa, two different children were identified as possible candidates to be the reincarnation: one was Mipam Chödrup Gyamtso, the stepbrother of the 6th Panchen Lama; the other was Könchok Garwang Gyatso (དཀོན་མཆོག་གར་དབང་རྒྱ་མཚོ) of the Namseling (རྣམ་སྲས་གླིང) family. The dispute was resolved by lot: Mipam Chödrup Gyamtso&#x27;s name was drawn and he was enthroned as the 10th Shamarpa. Könchok Garwang Gyatso was referred to as the Shamar Trisur or &quot;former Shamarpa&quot;; according to some accounts, he &quot;abdicated&quot; following the lottery, implying that he had originally been enthroned. In any event, the Shamar Trisur took up residence on his family&#x27;s estate at Namseling Manor, near Samye Monastery, and became a lama. Following his death , a reincarnation was identified, establishing a lineage known as Namling Shamar. The most recent Namling Shamar was the 5th, who was identified by the 15th Karmapa (1871–1922) and lived until 1982.

==Controversy==
In 1792 the Tibetan government accused the 10th Shamarpa of inciting a war between Tibet and Nepal. He was exiled from Tibet and a ban placed on his future incarnations from being officially recognized. A modern Tibetologist, Sam Van Schaik, has suggested this interpretation of history to be wrong and has claimed that the Shamarpa mediated in the conflict.

The comment of the Sixteenth Gyalwa Karmapa on this period was: &quot;Merit was becoming smaller and smaller. There was much political interference. Black was becoming white. The real was becoming unreal. At that time it was not practicable to have any Shamarpa recognised or enthroned. Everything was kept secret. The incarnations appeared, but were not revealed.&quot; In 1963, following a request from the 16th Karmapa, the Tibetan Government in Exile lifted the ban. The 14th Shamar Rinpoche was officially enthroned, and after completing his studies in 1979 began his extensive teaching activity.

Another controversy began in 1992, during the search for and recognition of the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa. A division formed within the Karma Kagyu sangha over the selection of two Karmapa candidates. The Karmapa controversy has its roots in feudalistic Tibetan history, and is connected with politics of China and India as well. The Karmapa candidates Ogyen Trinley Dorje and Thaye Dorje have met each other, and issued joint statements calling for cooperation, and the wish to find the 15th Shamar Rinpoche together.

==14th Shamarpa==
The 14th Shamarpa was Mipham Chokyi Lodro, born in Derge, Tibet in 1952. At age four he revealed his identity as the Shamarpa by recognizing old monks from Yangpochen monastery, the ancestral seat of the Shamarpas. His uncle, the 16th Karmapa, recognized him as the reincarnation of the previous Shamarpa.
In 1964 the 14th Shamar Rinpoche was officially enthroned in Karmapa&#x27;s Rumtek monastery. At this occasion the Karmapa wrote a poem:
:The most exalted, the lord of the lands of snow is Avalokiteśvara.
:The coalescence of his essence is the glorious Karmapa.
:Inseparable from his three mysteries, in the manner of the three lords,
:Is his manifestation, the great emanation; the majestic sun,
:Whom I invest now sovereign of the practice lineage&#x27;s order.
:By the power of scattering auspicious flowers of excellent virtue,
:Combined with the true words of the ṛiṣhi&#x27;s truthfulness,
:May he successfully and everlastingly be the sovereign of the order.

Shamar Rinpoche received the entire cycle of Kagyu teachings from the 16th Karmapa. He stayed close with the 16th Karmapa until his death in 1981.

Shamar Rinpoche was interested in the topic of Buddhism and democracy. His book &quot;Creating a Transparent Democracy&quot; lays out a framework for establishing a genuine democratic system of governance that promotes welfare and prosperity. He also founded the &quot;Infinite Compassion Foundation&quot; with the cause to promote the humane treatment of animals raised for consumption of meat and other products.

Shamar Rinpoche died on 11 June 2014 in Germany

<text>Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve, or mathematical function, that has the best fit to a series of data points, possibly subject to constraints. Curve fitting can involve either interpolation, where an exact fit to the data is required, or smoothing, in which a &quot;smooth&quot; function is constructed that approximately fits the data. A related topic is regression analysis, which focuses more on questions of statistical inference such as how much uncertainty is present in a curve that is fitted to data observed with random errors. Fitted curves can be used as an aid for data visualization, to infer values of a function where no data are available, and to summarize the relationships among two or more variables. Extrapolation refers to the use of a fitted curve beyond the range of the observed data, and is subject to a degree of uncertainty since it may reflect the method used to construct the curve as much as it reflects the observed data.

For linear-algebraic analysis of data, &quot;fitting&quot; usually means trying to find the curve that minimizes the vertical (&quot;y&quot;-axis) displacement of a point from the curve (e.g., ordinary least squares). However, for graphical and image applications, geometric fitting seeks to provide the best visual fit; which usually means trying to minimize the orthogonal distance to the curve (e.g., total least squares), or to otherwise include both axes of displacement of a point from the curve. Geometric fits are not popular because they usually require non-linear and/or iterative calculations, although they have the advantage of a more aesthetic and geometrically accurate result.

==Algebraic fitting of functions to data points==
Most commonly, one fits a function of the form .

===Fitting lines and polynomial functions to data points===

The first degree polynomial equation

:formula_1

is a line with slope &quot;a&quot;. A line will connect any two points, so a first degree polynomial equation is an exact fit through any two points with distinct x coordinates.

If the order of the equation is increased to a second degree polynomial, the following results:

:formula_2

This will exactly fit a simple curve to three points.

If the order of the equation is increased to a third degree polynomial, the following is obtained:

:formula_3

This will exactly fit four points.

A more general statement would be to say it will exactly fit four constraints. Each constraint can be a point, angle, or curvature (which is the reciprocal of the radius of an osculating circle). Angle and curvature constraints are most often added to the ends of a curve, and in such cases are called end conditions. Identical end conditions are frequently used to ensure a smooth transition between polynomial curves contained within a single spline. Higher-order constraints, such as &quot;the change in the rate of curvature&quot;, could also be added. This, for example, would be useful in highway cloverleaf design to understand the rate of change of the forces applied to a car (see jerk), as it follows the cloverleaf, and to set reasonable speed limits, accordingly.

The first degree polynomial equation could also be an exact fit for a single point and an angle while the third degree polynomial equation could also be an exact fit for two points, an angle constraint, and a curvature constraint. Many other combinations of constraints are possible for these and for higher order polynomial equations.

If there are more than &quot;n&quot; + 1 constraints (&quot;n&quot; being the degree of the polynomial), the polynomial curve can still be run through those constraints. An exact fit to all constraints is not certain (but might happen, for example, in the case of a first degree polynomial exactly fitting three collinear points). In general, however, some method is then needed to evaluate each approximation. The least squares method is one way to compare the deviations.

There are several reasons given to get an approximate fit when it is possible to simply increase the degree of the polynomial equation and get an exact match.:

* Even if an exact match exists, it does not necessarily follow that it can be readily discovered. Depending on the algorithm used there may be a divergent case, where the exact fit cannot be calculated, or it might take too much computer time to find the solution. This situation might require an approximate solution.
* The effect of averaging out questionable data points in a sample, rather than distorting the curve to fit them exactly, may be desirable.
* Runge&#x27;s phenomenon: high order polynomials can be highly oscillatory. If a curve runs through two points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, it would be expected that the curve would run somewhat near the midpoint of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, as well. This may not happen with high-order polynomial curves; they may even have values that are very large in positive or negative magnitude. With low-order polynomials, the curve is more likely to fall near the midpoint (it&#x27;s even guaranteed to exactly run through the midpoint on a first degree polynomial).
* Low-order polynomials tend to be smooth and high order polynomial curves tend to be &quot;lumpy&quot;. To define this more precisely, the maximum number of inflection points possible in a polynomial curve is &quot;n-2&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the order of the polynomial equation. An inflection point is a location on the curve where it switches from a positive radius to negative. We can also say this is where it transitions from &quot;holding water&quot; to &quot;shedding water&quot;. Note that it is only &quot;possible&quot; that high order polynomials will be lumpy; they could also be smooth, but there is no guarantee of this, unlike with low order polynomial curves. A fifteenth degree polynomial could have, at most, thirteen inflection points, but could also have eleven, or nine or any odd number down to one. (Polynomials with even numbered degree could have any even number of inflection points from &quot;n&quot; - 2 down to zero.)

The degree of the polynomial curve being higher than needed for an exact fit is undesirable for all the reasons listed previously for high order polynomials, but also leads to a case where there are an infinite number of solutions. For example, a first degree polynomial (a line) constrained by only a single point, instead of the usual two, would give an infinite number of solutions. This brings up the problem of how to compare and choose just one solution, which can be a problem for software and for humans, as well. For this reason, it is usually best to choose as low a degree as possible for an exact match on all constraints, and perhaps an even lower degree, if an approximate fit is acceptable.

===Fitting other functions to data points===
Other types of curves, such as trigonometric functions (such as sine and cosine), may also be used, in certain cases.

In spectroscopy, data may be fitted with Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt and related functions.

In biology, ecology, demography, epidemiology, and many other disciplines, the growth of a population, the spread of infectious disease, etc. can be fitted using the logistic function.

In agriculture the inverted logistic sigmoid function (S-curve) is used to describe the relation between crop yield and growth factors. The blue figure was made by a sigmoid regression of data measured in farm lands. It can be seen that initially, i.e. at low soil salinity, the crop yield reduces slowly at increasing soil salinity, while thereafter the decrease progresses faster.

==Geometric fitting of plane curves to data points==
If a function of the form formula_4 cannot be postulated, one can still try to fit a plane curve.

Other types of curves, such as conic sections (circular, elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic arcs) or trigonometric functions (such as sine and cosine), may also be used, in certain cases. For example, trajectories of objects under the influence of gravity follow a parabolic path, when air resistance is ignored. Hence, matching trajectory data points to a parabolic curve would make sense. Tides follow sinusoidal patterns, hence tidal data points should be matched to a sine wave, or the sum of two sine waves of different periods, if the effects of the Moon and Sun are both considered.

For a parametric curve, it is effective to fit each of its coordinates as a separate function of arc length; assuming that data points can be ordered, the chord distance may be used.

===Fitting a circle by geometric fit===


Coope approaches the problem of trying to find the best visual fit of circle to a set of 2D data points. The method elegantly transforms the ordinarily non-linear problem into a linear problem that can be solved without using iterative numerical methods, and is hence much faster than previous techniques.

===Fitting an ellipse by geometric fit===
The above technique is extended to general ellipses by adding a non-linear step, resulting in a method that is fast, yet finds visually pleasing ellipses of arbitrary orientation and displacement.

==Fitting surfaces==

Note that while this discussion was in terms of 2D curves, much of this logic also extends to 3D surfaces, each patch of which is defined by a net of curves in two parametric directions, typically called u and v. A surface may be composed of one or more surface patches in each direction.

==Software==
Many statistical packages such as R and numerical software such as the gnuplot, GNU Scientific Library, Igor Pro, MLAB, Maple, MATLAB, TK Solver 6.0, Scilab, Mathematica, GNU Octave, and SciPy include commands for doing curve fitting in a variety of scenarios. There are also programs specifically written to do curve fitting; they can be found in the lists of statistical and numerical-analysis programs as well as in :Category:Regression and curve fitting software.

<text>CKND-DT (channel 9) is a television station in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, part of the Global Television Network. The station is owned and operated by network parent Corus Entertainment, with studios on the 30th floor of 201 Portage in downtown Winnipeg, and transmitter atop the building.

==History==
===Acquisition and licensing===
CKND&#x27;s predecessor, KCND-TV, began broadcasting from Pembina, North Dakota, in November 1960. Although a U.S. station, it depended almost entirely on advertising from the media market of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. In February 1973, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced that it had received two applications for new television stations in Winnipeg. One had been submitted by Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd., the parent company of CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba. The other application had been received from Continental Communications Ltd. of Vancouver, British Columbia, represented by Ray Peters, the president of Vancouver CTV affiliate CHAN-TV.

The CRTC solicited competing applications for the new Winnipeg television licence, and Peter Liba, who was then the executive assistant to Manitoba Liberal Party leader Izzy Asper, suggested that they make a bid. Wanting to save money on buying the needed equipment, Asper negotiated with Gordon McLendon to acquire the assets of KCND, convincing him that a new Winnipeg station would cut into KCND&#x27;s revenues and that Winnipeg advertisers would likely lose tax deductions for American advertising costs.

McLendon sold the station&#x27;s facilities and equipment to Canwest Broadcasting, established by Asper and partners Paul Morton and Seymour Epstein, for $780,000, contingent on Canwest securing a broadcasting licence. At the CRTC&#x27;s public hearings in Winnipeg in May 1974, Canwest noted that the acquisition of KCND would give their new Winnipeg station a $2 million advertising base and would save $1.5 million in capital and start-up costs compared to the alternative of launching a completely new station.

At the same hearing, competing applications were presented by Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd. and by Communications Winnipeg Co-Op, which proposed a member-supported non-commercial station. (Continental Communications had withdrawn its application prior to the hearings.) John Boler, the owner of Valley City–Fargo, North Dakota, CBS affiliate KXJB-TV and future owner of KVRR/KNRR, also used the occasion to announce his intention to launch a new Pembina-based station on channel 12.

In September 1974, the CRTC awarded the Winnipeg channel 9 licence to Canwest, which formally took possession and assumed day-to-day management of KCND-TV on March 31, 1975 (due to foreign ownership restrictions, the McLendon Corporation remained the official licensee of KCND until it surrendered the station&#x27;s broadcasting licence to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission [FCC] later that year). The same month, Canwest confirmed that the new station would operate from a former supermarket at 603 St. Mary&#x27;s Road in Winnipeg and use an antenna mounted on the CBWT tower in Starbuck, Manitoba, to avoid having to dismantle KCND&#x27;s tower during the transition. KCND-TV general manager G. O. Johnson was appointed executive vice-president and general manager of CanWest Broadcasting. In May 1975, Canwest announced that KCND&#x27;s 17 Winnipeg-based employees had all accepted offers of employment at the new station, but that there was little interest among the station&#x27;s 22 Pembina-based employees.

===Broadcasting===
During Labour Day weekend, on August 31, 1975, CKND signed on channel 9 (broadcast) and channel 12 (cable), both shown prominently in the station&#x27;s logo. Both CKND and KCND simulcast the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon&quot; until 5:30 p.m. on September 1, 1975, after which KCND permanently left the air.

The former KCND tower was later moved to Asper&#x27;s birthplace of Minnedosa, Manitoba, a small town north of Brandon, to serve western Manitoba. Together, the two transmitters reach 91% of Manitoba&#x27;s population. Its first regularly scheduled program following the MDA telethon was &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot;.

In 1981, KCND became the call letters for KCND-FM, the first Prairie Public Radio station in Bismarck, North Dakota. The same year, the U.S. FCC issued a construction permit for a new station to serve Pembina, North Dakota on channel 12. The station&#x27;s launch, however, would remain delayed until 1986.

During a June 1981 hearing to extend CKND-TV&#x27;s signal into the Westman area and to hear the application by Western Manitoba Broadcasters Ltd. (Craig) for a new television station at Portage la Prairie, Canwest said that the Westman transmitter on a VHF channel would reach up to 175,000 more viewers than with the CKND-TV Winnipeg signal. The signal would stretch from the U.S. border to Dauphin, and from Central Manitoba to Saskatchewan.

 At an April 1982 CRTC hearing regarding licensing a new television station for southern Manitoba, Canwest stated that while they were given VHF channel 2 to operate the CKND-TV-2 rebroadcaster, they could have used VHF channel 13 instead. Canwest also stated that it would require a population of over 100,000 to serve the Interlake area with two or three UHF transmitters, rather than the 30,000 that existed at the time.

On-air signal testing on channel 2 with colour bars, test slides and test programming began in early August. CKND-TV-2 began broadcasting at 6 p.m. on September 1, 1982. Cable TV viewers in Dauphin were unable to watch the launch of CKND-TV-2 channel 2 because the cable company, Westman Media Co-op, did not have an antenna ready to receive the new signal.

In the mid-1980s, the station supported the development of a Manitoba film industry by funding television films, most notably &quot;The Prodigal&quot; and &quot;Tramp at the Door&quot;. Faced with the dilemma that the films would typically need to be sold to the national CBC or CTV networks to attain profitability, but the station would have to accept a reduced price if the films had already aired in prime time in a major Canadian television market, station manager Stan Thomas would air the films on CKND in an obscure overnight timeslot so that they would be eligible for ACTRA Award consideration, while still having been essentially unseen by an actual television audience so that he could secure the maximum price from a network.
On January 1, 1986, channel 12 returned in Pembina, North Dakota, as KNRR, a satellite of independent station KVRR (channel 15) in Fargo. Canadian cable providers were prohibited from distributing the signal, however, by an October 1986 CRTC decision in response to broadcaster concerns about the &quot;potentially damaging effect of this station by providing Canadian advertisers with access to large amounts of commercial airtime at rates substantially lower than those they would be obliged to pay Canadian television licensees in order to reach the same potential audience&quot;. As the satellite station was never profitable due to its location, as well as its difficulties in being able to reach the Winnipeg audience, KNRR went off the air from June to October 2009 as the station did not upgrade to a digital signal.
Along with the other Canwest-owned stations, CKND was rebranded as Global in August 1997. CKND&#x27;s studios also produced &quot;Fox Soccer Report&quot;, which aired throughout the world on Fox Sports World Canada, Fox Soccer Channel, and Fox Sports Middle East. On September 1, 2008, CKND moved its operations to downtown Winnipeg at Canwest Place (now called 201 Portage).

On April 1, 2016, Shaw Media (which was rebranded from Canwest in 2010) was sold to Corus Entertainment. The deal provided CKND three radio stations (CJOB, CFPG-FM and CJKR-FM) as sister properties.

==News operation==

CKND-DT presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week ( hours each weekday and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). On November 14, 2009, the station introduced a weekend evening 10 p.m. newscast. In December 2009, longtime anchor Eva Kovacs announced that she would be leaving CKND after nearly twelve years with the station, to work for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority in 2010. Shannon Martin was named as her replacement. Her departure came only a few months after lead weather anchor Andrea Slobodian and reporter Meera Bahadoosingh left for Shaw TV Calgary and Winnipeg respectively, and nightwatch anchor Trina Maus left for CKVR-TV in Barrie, Ontario.

The spring and summer of 2011 brought a few high-profile departures to the station; first weekend anchor and reporter Nicole Dube left to become the Manitoba correspondent for Sun News Network. Dube&#x27;s replacement, Lindsay Warner, left the station to become the late night anchor at CKY-DT, lead weather anchor Craig Larkins left for CFRN-DT Edmonton in July, and in late August it was announced that senior anchor Shannon Martin would also be leaving to pursue her career in Ontario. Her last broadcast was September 2, 2011. That same month, it was announced that Kate Gajdosik would be the new weather/community anchor, joining the station from CIVT-DT Vancouver in September 2011.

On September 7, 2011, it was announced that Shaw Media would be continuing its expansion of political programming and Global News would be launching provincial half-hour political programs in several markets. Similar in format to Global Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Focus Ontario&quot; and Global Montreal&#x27;s &quot;Focus Montreal&quot;, these new political programs launched in Saskatchewan on CFRE-DT and CFSK-DT, as well as CKND, on October 15, 2011. In late 2011, Global Winnipeg became the first television station in Manitoba to broadcast its local news in high definition.

On February 6, 2012, CKND launched a three-hour weekday morning newscast, airing from 6 to 9 a.m. Around the same time, CKND became the first Winnipeg station to acquire a news helicopter, Skyview 1. The vehicle was grounded in summer 2017. On August 20, 2012, CKND expanded its half-hour 10 p.m. newscast to one hour, which was re-titled from &quot;Prime News&quot; to &quot;News Hour Final&quot;, cancelling their 30-minute 11 p.m. newscast, &quot;News Final&quot;.

Global Winnipeg&#x27;s supper-time newscast ranked third in the Winnipeg TV market. As of spring 2016, &quot;Global News at 6&quot; averaged 31,800 viewers (a drop from 32,500 in fall 2015) to CTV Winnipeg&#x27;s 103,900 and CBC Winnipeg&#x27;s 39,800. As of fall 2015, Global&#x27;s late-night &quot;News Hour Final&quot;, ranks first with 17,200 viewers to CTV Winnipeg&#x27;s 15,200, a significant drop from Global Winnipeg&#x27;s 27,400 viewers in fall 2014.

On April 1, 2016, CKND-DT was sold to Corus Entertainment, and earned three radio stations for sister networks.

Starting April 11, 2016, Global Winnipeg, along with all Global owned-and-operated stations, rebranded its news programs. All of their news programs received new names: &quot;Global News Morning&quot;, &quot;Global News at 6&quot;, and &quot;Global News at 10&quot;.

On July 27, 2018, longtime Global Winnipeg personality and anchor of &quot;Global News at 6&quot; Lauren McNabb left the station to go to sister radio station Global News Radio 680 CJOB, to co-host their morning show. She was replaced by Heather Steele, who had been co-anchor of &quot;Global News at 6&quot; before her maternity leave in 2017.

On April 13, 2019, Kovacs announced on Facebook that she would be departing the station for the second time. Before becoming the station&#x27;s community producer, she anchored &quot;Global News Morning&quot; (then &quot;Morning News&quot;) from 2012 to 2015. &quot;Global News at 6&quot; anchor Heather Steele announced on May 15, 2019, that she would be departing the station for a new role at sister station CJOB. Steele officially departed Global Winnipeg on July 12, 2019. On July 25, 2019, Global Winnipeg announced that Steele&#x27;s replacement would be Lisa Dutton, former anchor of &quot;Global News Morning&quot; at Global Saskatoon. Dutton officially started on July 30, 2019.

<text>Robert Henry Robinson (17 December 1927 – 12 August 2011) was an English radio and television presenter, game show host, journalist and author. He presented &quot;Ask the Family&quot; for many years on the BBC.

==Biography and career==
Robinson was born in Liverpool, the son of an accountant father, and educated at Raynes Park Grammar School in south London and Exeter College, Oxford. He then became a journalist for the &quot;Sunday Chronicle&quot; (TV columnist), the &quot;Sunday Graphic&quot; (film and theatre columnist), the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; (radio critic and editor of &quot;Atticus&quot;) and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; (film critic).

He began working on television as a journalist in 1955. During the 1960s and 1970s, he presented the series &quot;Open House&quot;, &quot;Picture Parade&quot;, &quot;Points of View&quot;, the leading literary quiz &quot;Take it or Leave it&quot;, &quot;Ask the Family&quot;, &quot;BBC-3&quot; – including the discussion during which Kenneth Tynan became the first person to say &quot;fuck&quot; on British television (Robinson told Tynan that this was &quot;an easy way to make history&quot;) – and &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;.

In 1967, Robinson presented the edition of &quot;The Look of the Week&quot; in which classical musicologist Hans Keller was brought face to face with the young Pink Floyd. He wrote and presented &quot;The Fifties&quot; on BBC1. Robinson was the presenter of &quot;The Book Programme&quot; on BBC2 from 1973 to 1980 and a number of spin-off documentaries, such as &quot;B. Traven – A Mystery Solved&quot; (1979). He wrote and presented several BBC1 documentaries under the title &quot;Robinson&#x27;s Travels&quot;, among them &quot;The Mormon Trail&quot; (1976), &quot;Cruising&quot; and &quot;Indian Journey&quot;. In 1986 he wrote and presented &quot;The Magic Rectangle&quot;, one of the BBC documentaries marking the 50th anniversary of television.
On radio, he presented &quot;Today&quot;, BBC Radio 4&#x27;s flagship morning news show, and &quot;Stop The Week&quot;, a fiercely competitive talk programme. Robinson fronted &quot;Brain of Britain&quot; on BBC Radio 4 for many years, but was replaced by Russell Davies during the 2004 series owing to illness. He returned to host the new series in 2005 until handing over the reins to Peter Snow in 2007. In September 2008 Robinson chaired the special &quot;Brain of Brains&quot; and &quot;Top Brain&quot; editions of the quiz and returned to host the series in 2008; Davies then replaced him for the 2009 shows. In August 2010 it was announced that Robinson was to step down permanently from &quot;Brain of Britain&quot; to be replaced by Davies.

&quot;Private Eye&quot; used to lampoon Robinson under the nickname &#x27;Smuggins&#x27;. In a sketch on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Not the Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; he was impersonated by an actor wearing a cricket box over his forehead. Robinson was also the subject of a sketch by Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie in the second series of &quot;A Bit of Fry and Laurie&quot;, and Fry occasionally did an affectionate impression of Robinson when hosting the quiz show &quot;QI&quot;. He was also lampooned by comedy duo David Mitchell and Robert Webb in the second series of &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Look&quot;, where he was shown as the presenter of an early version of their fictional gameshow &quot;Numberwang&quot;. He appeared in a &quot;Viz comic&quot; strip under the name Robin Robertson. He was the father of the actress Lucy Robinson. Robinson was known for his comb-over hairstyle.

== Personal life ==
Robinson married actress Josephine Richard, whom he had met while a student at Oxford, in 1958. They had three children. The couple remained together for more than fifty years, until Robert&#x27;s death, aged 83. He died in St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington on 12 August 2011 after a long period of ill health.

<doc id="555432" wikidata="Q1097490" url="?curid=555432" title="Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome">
<text>Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder, and is one of the RASopathies. It was first described in 1986.

It is characterized by the following:

*Distinctive facial appearance
*Unusually sparse, brittle, curly scalp hair
*A range of skin abnormalities from dermatitis to thick, scaly skin over the entire body (generalized ichthyosis)
*Heart malformations in over 75% of patients (congenital or appearing later), especially an obstruction of the normal flow of blood from the lower right ventricle of the heart to the lungs (valvar pulmonary stenosis)
*Growth delays
*Feeding problems associated with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
*Foot abnormalities (extra toe or fusion of two or more toes)
*Intellectual disability
*Failure to thrive

==Presentation==
=== Head ===
Individuals with the disorder usually have distinctive malformations of the craniofacial area including an unusually large head (macrocephaly), prominent forehead, and abnormal narrowing of both sides of the forehead (bitemporal constriction); The nose can be upturned and short with a low nasal bridge; and large ears that are abnormally rotated toward the back of the head. In many cases, affected individuals also have downward slanting eyelid folds, widely spaced eyes, drooping of the upper eyelids, inward deviation of the eyes, and other eye abnormalities including absent eyebrows and eyelashes.

=== Gastrointestinal system ===
==Genetic ==
Costello and Noonan syndrome are similar to CFC and their phenotypic overlap may be due to the biochemical relationship of the genes mutated in each syndrome. Genes that are mutated in all three of these syndromes encode proteins that function in the MAP kinase pathway.

* Mutations that cause CFC are found in the KRAS, BRAF, MEK1, and MEK2 genes.
* Costello syndrome is caused by mutations in HRAS.
* Mutations that cause Noonan syndrome have been found in PTPN11 and SOS1.

The relative severity of CFC when compared to Noonan syndrome may reflect the position in the biochemical pathway occupied by the affected genes. 
* Shp2, the protein product of the PTPN11 gene, appears to regulate the MAP kinase pathway at or above the level of SOS1.
* SOS1 in turn regulates the activities of RAS, RAF, MEK, ERK, and p90RSK.
* SOS1 has been demonstrated to be a target of negative feedback by ERK and p90RSK.

Thus, any activating mutation downstream of SOS1 may be subject to less regulation that might mitigate the consequence of such mutations, giving rise to the phenotypic differences seen between these syndromes.

<doc id="555445" wikidata="Q928118" url="?curid=555445" title="John Tory">
<text>John Howard Tory (born May 28, 1954) is a Canadian lawyer, broadcaster, businessman, and former politician who served as the 65th mayor of Toronto from 2014 to 2023. He served as leader of the Official Opposition in Ontario from 2005 to 2007 while he was leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario from 2004 to 2009.

After a career as a lawyer, political strategist and businessman, Tory ran as a mayoral candidate in the 2003 Toronto municipal election and lost to David Miller. Tory was subsequently elected as Ontario PC leader from 2004 to 2009, and was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario representing Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey and serving as the leader of the Opposition in Ontario from 2005 to 2007. After his resignation as PC leader in 2009, Tory became a radio talk show host on CFRB. Despite widespread speculation, Tory did not run for mayor again in 2010. He was also the volunteer chair of the non-profit group CivicAction from 2010 to 2014.

On October 27, 2014, Tory was elected mayor of Toronto, defeating incumbent mayor Rob Ford&#x27;s brother, councillor Doug Ford and former councillor and member of Parliament (MP) Olivia Chow. On October 22, 2018, he was re-elected mayor of Toronto in the 2018 mayoral election, defeating former chief city planner Jennifer Keesmaat. He was elected to a third term as mayor on October 24, 2022, after defeating urbanist Gil Penalosa. He announced his intention to imminently resign as mayor on February 10, 2023, after admitting to having an affair with a staffer during the COVID-19 pandemic. He submitted his resignation letter to the city clerk on February 15, and formally left office on February 17, at 5 p.m. Tory was succeeded by Olivia Chow as mayor of Toronto.

==Early life and education==
John Howard Tory, the eldest of four, was born on May 28, 1954, in Toronto, Ontario, to Elizabeth (née Bacon) and John A. Tory, president of Thomson Investments Limited and a director of Rogers Communications. His grandfather was lawyer John S. D. Tory and his great-grandfather founded Sun Life of Canada.

He attended the University of Toronto Schools, at the time a publicly-funded high school affiliated with the University of Toronto. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Trinity College at the University of Toronto in 1975. He received his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1978 from Osgoode Hall Law School of York University. He was called to the bar in Ontario in 1980.

==Business and early political career==
From 1972 to 1979, Tory was hired by family friend Ted Rogers as a journalist for Rogers Broadcasting&#x27;s Toronto radio stations CFTR and CHFI. From 1980 to 1981, and later from 1986 to 1995, Tory held various positions at Tory, Tory, DesLauriers &amp; Binnington including partner, managing partner, and member of the Executive Committee.

From 1981 to 1985, Tory served in the office of the premier of Ontario, Bill Davis, as principal secretary to the premier and associate secretary of the cabinet. After Davis retired as premier in 1985, Tory joined the office of the Canadian Special Envoy on Acid Rain, as special advisor. The special envoy had been appointed by the Mulroney government to review matters of air quality with a United States counterpart. Tory supported Dianne Cunningham&#x27;s bid to lead the Ontario PCs in 1990.

Tory later served as tour director and campaign chairman to then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and managed the 1993 federal election campaign of Mulroney&#x27;s successor, Kim Campbell. In his role as the Progressive Conservative campaign co-manager that year, he authorized two infamous campaign ads that ridiculed Liberal candidate Jean Chretien&#x27;s face, which is partially paralyzed due to a childhood disease. The ads were greeted with much outcry among the Canadian public. They were withdrawn ten days after their first airings, and the Progressive Conservatives would proceed to be decimated in the federal election.

From 1995 to 1999, he returned to Rogers Communications, but this time as president and CEO of Rogers Media which had become one of Canada&#x27;s largest publishing and broadcasting companies. Rogers has interests in radio and television stations, internet, specialty television channels, consumer magazines, trade magazines and, at the time, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; and the Sun newspaper chain.

In 1999, he became president and CEO of Rogers subsidiary Rogers Cable, which he led through a period of transition from a monopoly environment to an open marketplace, overseeing a significant increase in operating income. Tory stepped down after Ted Rogers announced that he would stay on as president and CEO of parent company Rogers Communications. He served as the ninth commissioner of the Canadian Football League from 1996 to 2000. Tory later was a board member of Rogers between 2010 and 2014, stepping down to run for Mayor of Toronto.

Tory continued to have an interest in being a broadcaster throughout his life and, as a Rogers executive, hosted a public affairs program on Rogers Cable&#x27;s community access channel for many years. He sat as a board member of Metro Inc., the Quebec-based parent corporation for Metro and Food Basics grocery stores.

=== First campaign for mayor (2003) ===
After six years as a key backer of retiring Toronto Mayor Mel Lastman, Tory ran in the November 2003 election for mayor of Toronto. He finished in second place, behind councillor David Miller and ahead of former mayor Barbara Hall, former councillor and MP John Nunziata, and former councillor and budget chief Tom Jakobek.

Tory and Miller both entered the race with limited name recognition and support, but each quickly claimed a core base—Miller among progressives and Tory among more conservative voters. Meanwhile, Hall&#x27;s initially commanding lead slowly dissipated over the course of the campaign, and the campaigns of both Nunziata and Jakobek were sidelined by controversies.. One of his campaign co-chairs was Mitzie Hunter.

Tory also accepted an endorsement from the Toronto Police Association. He held the traditional suburban conservative vote that had helped to elect Mel Lastman in the 1997 mayor&#x27;s campaign, but lost the overall vote to Miller in a close race. After the election, Tory helped Miller and Hall raise funds to repay their campaign debts. 

==Leader of the Ontario PC Party==

In March 2004, Tory hinted that he would be seeking the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives, after Ernie Eves announced his intention to resign from that post. The provincial PC leadership election was announced for September 18, 2004, and Tory made his candidacy official on May 6, 2004. John Laschinger was appointed to be Tory&#x27;s campaign manager. Tory won the support of former provincial cabinet ministers Elizabeth Witmer, David Tsubouchi, Jim Wilson, Janet Ecker, Chris Hodgson, Cam Jackson, Phil Gillies and Bob Runciman as well as backbench members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) Norm Miller, Laurie Scott, Ted Arnott and John O&#x27;Toole.

Tory&#x27;s opponents for the leadership post were former provincial minister of finance Jim Flaherty and Oak Ridges MPP Frank Klees. Tory defeated Flaherty with 54 per cent on the second ballot. When Flaherty later left provincial politics to seek a seat in the House of Commons as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada, Tory endorsed his former rival in the 2006 election; Flaherty was elected and was appointed the federal minister of finance. Tory also campaigned prominently with Flaherty&#x27;s wife Christine Elliott in the provincial by-election held March 30, enabling her to win the seat formerly held by her husband.

Tory told the media in November 2004 that he would seek election to the legislature in time for the spring 2005 legislative session.

On January 31, 2005, after much public speculation and some delay, Ernie Eves resigned his seat and cleared the way for Tory to run in Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, the safest PC seat in the province. As a &quot;parachute candidate&quot;, Tory faced some criticism about his commitment to the riding. Nevertheless, he easily won the March 17, 2005 by-election with 56 per cent of the vote. Former premier Bill Davis appeared for Tory&#x27;s first session in the legislature as PC leader.

===2007 Ontario general election===
In the 2007 general election, Tory ran in the Toronto riding of Don Valley West, the area where he grew up, raised his family and lived most of his life.

Tory released his platform on June 9, 2007. The platform, &quot;A Plan for a Better Ontario&quot;, commits a PC government to eliminate the health care tax introduced by the previous government, put scrubbers on coal-fired power plants, address Ontario&#x27;s doctor shortage, allow new private health care partnerships provided services are paid by the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP), impose more penalties on illegal land occupations in response to the Caledonia land dispute, fast-track the building of nuclear power plants, and invest the gas tax in public transit and roads. A costing of the platform released in August estimated that the PC promises would cost an additional $14 billion over four years.

The PC campaign was formally launched on September 3. Most of the campaign was dominated by discussion of his plan to extend public funding to Ontario&#x27;s faith-based separate schools, during which Tory supported allowing the teaching of creationism in religious studies classes. Earlier in the year, indications were that the party would have been a strong contender to win the election, but the school funding promise resulted in the Liberals regaining the lead in popular support for the duration of the campaign. Later in the campaign, in the face of heavy opposition, Tory promised a free vote on the issue.

With the beginning of the official campaign period on September 10, the PC campaign made clear its intention to make the previous government&#x27;s record a key issue. In particular, Tory focused on the Liberals&#x27; 2003 election and 2004 pre-budget promise not to raise taxes and their subsequent imposition of a health care tax.

On election night, the PCs made minor gains and remained the Official Opposition while Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s Liberals were re-elected with a majority. Tory was defeated in Don Valley West by the incumbent Ontario Liberal MPP, Minister of Education Kathleen Wynne. Although Tory was defeated in both his riding of Don Valley West and the race for the premiership, he said that he would stay on as leader unless the party wanted him to resign.

===Leading from outside the legislature===
As a result of the election loss, the party decided to hold a leadership review vote at its 2008 general party meeting in London. Tory received 66.9 percent support, lower than internal tracking which showed him in the more comfortable 70 percent range. Three hours after the leadership review vote, Tory announced to the delegates that he would be staying on as leader. He came under heavy criticism from several party members following this delay, with his opponents signalling that they would continue to call for an end to what they called his &#x27;weak&#x27; leadership. Other party members supported Tory, saying that his opponents should accept the results and move on.

Throughout 2008, Tory&#x27;s leadership of the party was perceived to be tenuous, as he faced widespread criticism for his seeming failure to convince a sitting MPP to resign in order to open a seat for him. Most notably, Bill Murdoch called for Tory to resign as party leader in September, resulting in his suspension from the party caucus on September 12. Six days later, Murdoch was permanently expelled from the party caucus. In December 2008, media pundits speculated that Prime Minister Stephen Harper would appoint PC MPP Bob Runciman to the Senate in order to clear the way for Tory to run in Runciman&#x27;s comfortably safe riding of Leeds—Grenville. However, Harper did not do so.

On January 9, 2009, PC MPP Laurie Scott announced her resignation from the legislature, allowing Tory to run in the resulting by-election in Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock, a normally safe PC riding in central Ontario. In exchange for agreeing to resign, Scott was given the post of chair of the party&#x27;s election preparedness committee until the 2011 election, and $100,000 in severance pay. On March 5, 2009, he lost the by-election to Liberal candidate Rick Johnson. Tory announced his resignation from the party leadership the next day and was succeeded by Bob Runciman as interim leader; Runciman had served twice as leader of the opposition during the two times Tory did not have a seat in the legislature. Niagara West—Glanbrook MPP Tim Hudak won the 2009 Ontario Progressive Conservative leadership election to become party leader and opposition leader.

Several weeks following the end of his provincial political career, Tory announced he was returning to broadcasting, to host a Sunday evening phone-in show on Toronto talk radio station CFRB. &quot;The John Tory Show&quot; simulcast on CHAM in Hamilton and CKTB in St. Catharines. He was also looking for opportunities in business, law or the non-profit sector.

In the fall of 2009, CFRB moved Tory to its Monday to Friday afternoon slot, for a new show, &quot;Live Drive&quot;, airing from 4pm to 7pm. The show first broadcast on October 5, 2009.

Tory was considering challenging incumbent Toronto Mayor David Miller in the 2010 municipal election as was Ontario Deputy Premier George Smitherman. On September 25, 2009, Miller announced he was not running for re-election. Tory announced on January 7 that he was not running in order to continue his radio show and also become head of the Toronto City Summit Alliance. On August 5, 2010, after a week of press speculation that he was about to re-enter the race, Tory confirmed that he would not be running in 2010 for mayor of Toronto.

Tory&#x27;s last broadcast was February 21, 2014, after which he declared his candidacy for mayor.

== Mayor of Toronto (2014–2023) ==

=== Elections ===
Tory registered as a candidate for the 2014 Toronto mayoral election on February 24, 2014. In his launch video he stated that building a Yonge Street relief line was &quot;job one&quot; if elected mayor. On May 27, he announced his Toronto relief plan, entitled SmartTrack, providing electric commuter rail along existing GO train infrastructure with service from Unionville to Pearson Airport. SmartTrack construction has still not begun as well as having seen several changes. On October 27, 2014, Tory was elected as mayor of Toronto.

Tory became mayor of Toronto on December 1, 2014. He spent his first day meeting with Premier Kathleen Wynne, emphasizing the importance of working with other levels of government. He also announced that Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong would be his deputy mayor. Minnan-Wong remained in the position for two terms, but did not seek re-election in 2022, and Tory selected Councillor Jennifer McKelvie as deputy mayor for his third term.On May 1, 2018, Tory registered his candidacy for re-election. Tory retained a high approval rating at 58%, with only 24% disapproving, and 18% undecided. He was a front runner in the polls for the mayoral election at 65–70% support. Tory was re-elected mayor of Toronto on October 22, 2018, defeating former chief city planner Jennifer Keesmaat with 63.49% of the vote.

Tory was re-elected to a third term in 2022, defeating urbanist Gil Penalosa with 62% of the vote.

=== Community safety and policing ===
Tory has sat on the Toronto Police Services Board (TPSB) since his election as mayor in 2014. The TPSB oversees the Toronto Police Service (TPS) by hiring the chief of police, setting policies, and approving the annual police budget.

==== Community contacts policy (carding) ====
Soon after the 2014 election, the TPSB quashed rules governing the use of the community contacts policy (&quot;carding&quot;), a controversial practice allowing police to randomly and routinely stop and demand identification and personal information from any individual deemed suspicious. The information collected is kept on record for an unspecified period and is easily accessible by police officers. Opponents allege it disproportionately targets Black people. The previous rules, brought in by former police chief Bill Blair, had required police to inform stopped individuals of their rights and to keep a record of each stop. Blair had also suspended the practice pending new rules.

Despite public demand to completely end carding, Tory initially defended the policy in general, stating it should be reformed, but not stopped. The practice was defended by the police union, which maintained that it was a &quot;proven, pro-active police investigative strategy that reduces, prevents and solves crime&quot;. On June 7, 2015, Tory called for an end to the policy, describing it as &quot;illegitimate, disrespectful and hurtful&quot; and stating it had &quot;eroded the public trust&quot;. In the TPSB meeting on June 18, Tory introduced a motion to end carding, however, the motion was subsequently amended to return to an initial 2014 version of the policy, which required officers to notify those they stop that the contact is voluntary and issue a physical receipt following the interaction. Carding was effectively ended province-wide in 2017 when the provincial community safety minister, Yasir Naqvi, issued a regulation banning police from collecting data arbitrarily.

==== Police reform ====
On June 25, 2020, in response to calls for police reform following the murder of George Floyd in the United States and a series of similar incidents in Toronto such as the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, councillors Josh Matlow and Kristyn Wong-Tam introduced a motion to cut the Toronto police budget by $122 million, or 10 per cent, and reallocate funds to community programming. Tory, along with a majority of council, rejected the proposal, instead passing a series of motions supported by Tory which did not include immediate defunding of the police. Among the motions included the creation of a non-police crisis response pilot program and a $5 million funding increase to allow for front-line officers to be equipped with body cameras. Tory claimed that a reduction in budget was likely if the program was successful.

During his term of office, he insisted on strengthening the resources of the police, the municipality&#x27;s main financial asset. The priority given to the police was at the expense of social services and housing, whose budgets were reduced.

==== Toronto Community Crisis Service ====
At its meeting on June 25, 2020, Toronto City Council considered a series of motions aimed at reforming policing and crisis response in the city. Tory tabled a motion to &quot;detask&quot; the police. The city would explore how duties currently assigned to sworn officers would be assumed by &quot;alternative models of community safety response&quot; to incidents where neither violence nor weapons are at issue. The proposal would &quot;commit that its first funding priority for future budgets [be] centered [&quot;sic&quot;] on a robust system of social supports and services&quot; and make an itemized line-by-line breakdown of the police budget public; a reduction in the police budget would likely ensue, according to the motion. Tory&#x27;s motion passed unanimously on June 29.

On January 26, 2022, the Executive Committee approved a staff report outlining an implementation plan for the pilot program. It was subsequently adopted by city council on February 2. According to Tory, &quot;the pilots will allow the city to test and to evaluate and to revise this model before we implement it on a larger scale but make no mistake it is our intention to implement it on a larger scale and to have it city-wide by 2025 at the latest&quot;.

In March 2022, the city launched the Toronto Community Crisis Service pilot program.

==== TTC safety ====
In 2022 and 2023, Toronto saw a series of violent incidents on the transit system, which saw employees and passengers seriously injured or killed in seemingly random attacks. Union leaders and passenger advocacy groups demanded action from the city, calling for increased mental health programs, social services and security. On January 26, 2023, Tory, along with police chief Myron Demkiw and TTC CEO Rick Leary announced that the city would deploy 80 additional police officers to patrol the transit system, using off-duty officers in an overtime capacity. Additionally, the TTC announced it would deploy 20 workers to provide outreach services to the homeless population on the TTC, and 50 security guards.

===Transportation ===

==== SmartTrack ====

As part of his campaign in 2014, Tory proposed utilizing existing GO Transit rail corridors to construct an above ground relief line, building on the existing GO Regional Express Rail expansion plan. The proposal would see the service operate 22 &quot;surface subway&quot; stations alongside GO trains from Mississauga&#x27;s Airport Corporate Centre south through Etobicoke towards Union Station, then north towards Markham. Tory initially said that the proposal would cost $8 billion, with the city covering $2.5 billion, funded through tax increment financing, and that SmartTrack would be completed in seven years.

After his election, as city and Metrolinx staff began studying his proposal, SmartTrack plans began to change, with stations changing, and questions raised surrounding the costs and integration. An updated plan saw the western portion being dropped in favour of extending the Eglinton Crosstown LRT. As other transit projects emerged, such as the Ontario Line, stations were dropped which would be serviced by new proposals.

The plan currently in place sees the construction of five new transit stations being completed in 2026, at a cost of $1.463 billion to the city.

==== Scarborough Subway extension ====
Tory supports a one-stop extension of Toronto subway Line 2 to serve a proposed transit hub at the Scarborough Town Centre as opposed to the three-stop Scarborough previously approved and fully funded under Ford. The LRT alternative failed in council in 2016. The Scarborough Subway Extension has completed the planning stage and as of 2016 was in the detailed design stage, with an estimated operation date of 2023.

==== Gardiner Expressway ====
In 2016, council faced a decision on the future of the elevated portion of the Gardiner Expressway east of Jarvis Street, as the aging structure would require significant renovations it was to remain in service beyond 2020. Citing his election promise to improve traffic, Tory supported a hybrid option, which would see roughly $1 billion spent to reconstruct the structure with on and off ramps reconfigured. The alternative proposal would have seen the expressway torn down at a cost of $461 million. On this issue, three members of his executive committee opposed him. Other politicians, including former mayor David Crombie and former chief city planner and 2018 Toronto mayoral candidate Jennifer Keesmaat opposed the renovation of the Gardiner Expressway, and prefer to tear it down instead.

==== Road tolls ====
During the 2003 election, Tory initially positioned himself against road tolls. As mayor, Tory&#x27;s position softened in 2016 when the city considered how it could raise revenue to fund transit projects. In November 2016, Tory&#x27;s announced that he would support tolls on the two municipally-owned expressways, the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway, which would have raised roughly $200 million annually. The proposal passed city council, however, as the municipal government is a creation of the provincial legislature, the city would need approval from the province to implement tolls, as the &quot;City of Toronto Act&quot;, which lays out the city&#x27;s legal powers did not allow for road tolls.

The provincial government ultimately rejected the idea in January 2017, with Premier Wynne stating that her government could not endorse road tolls on the Gardiner and Don Valley Parkway until better transit alternatives were in place for commuters outside of the city to enter downtown. Wynne instead committed to increasing the municipal share of the gas tax, which would give the city $170 million annually by 2022. While Tory was thankful for the increased gas tax share, he harshly criticized the province for denying the city a long-term option.

During the 2022 municipal election, Tory once again floated the idea of introducing road tolls. The provincial government under Premier Doug Ford once again rejected the idea.

=== Housing ===
In 2014, Tory selected Councillor Ana Bailão to be the chair of the affordable housing committee.

==== Modular housing ====
In September 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the city launched a housing response plan which would see 1000 units of modular housing contracted. The initiative identifies city owned sites to place the units and is part of the city&#x27;s housing strategy.

==== Toronto Seniors Housing Corporation ====
In 2021, the city launched a senior-focused social housing provider known as the Toronto Seniors Housing Corporation. It provides housing to 15,000 low and moderate income seniors in 83 Toronto Community Housing Corporation buildings, and employs staff from Toronto Community Housing&#x27;s former seniors unit.

==== ModernTO ====
Initially launched in 2019 to optimize the city&#x27;s office space, the ModernTO initiative was adopted by Toronto City Council in April 2022 and seeks to redevelop a number of city-owned properties as affordable housing. The initiative sees the city reduce its office footprint from 55 to 15 locations by creating office hubs in central buildings such as City Hall, the civic centres and Metro Hall. Eight buildings will be repurposed into affordable housing, creating 500 to 600 units.

==== 2023 housing action plan ====
Following the 2022 election, Tory introduced a suite of proposals in city council which would overhaul the city&#x27;s housing strategy. The proposals include ending exclusionary zoning, which would update by-laws to legalize laneway suites and garden suites, as well as exempting developments of four units or less from development charges. It includes incentivizing construction of rental housing by reducing fees and charges, the creation of a new Development and Growth Division, which aims at speeding up approval times. The proposal also allocates a portion of city-owned land to be developed by non-profits, asks the province to allow the city to create a &quot;use it or loose it&quot; policy for developers sitting on approved but undeveloped land. City staff will report back to council in March 2023 with a report on how to implement the changes.

While introduced with the housing action plan, a separate item includes legalize rooming houses city-wide by March 2024, which was previously deferred due to lack of support on council.

The proposal was described as &quot;a profoundly bold plan&quot; by former chief planner Jennifer Keesmaat, who ran against Tory for mayor in 2018, and praised by housing advocacy groups. Councillor Stephen Holyday described the plan as a &quot;death blow&quot; to detached homes such as those in his Etobicoke Centre ward.

=== Parks and recreation ===

==== Rail Deck Park ====
In August 2016, Tory proposed the development of a 21-acre greenspace in the downtown core constructed above the Railway Lands. The proposed park would span between the Rogers Centre and Bathurst Street. The proposal was priced at $1.66 billion.

The plan was contingent on the city securing air rights to the lands above the railway, owned by Canadian National Railway and Toronto Terminals Railway. A group of private developers disputed this, claiming they had already owned the air rights. City council moved to re-zone the area above the railway for park use only, which would prevent developers from building residential buildings as is the case in the surrounding area. The developers sided with the city in the provincial government&#x27;s Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT), which sided with the city, noting the growing downtown core and a lack of open space. The developers wished to build a 12-acre park as part of a development of eight condo and office towers.

In May 2021, LPAT issued a new ruling in response to sided with the developers, ruling the city should not have rejected a proposal to build a &quot;mixed use community&quot; over the land. The tribunal decision effectively ended the city&#x27;s plans to develop the land as park space. In a statement, Tory said he was &quot;deeply disappointed&quot; by the ruling and &quot;the possible impact on the future of Rail Deck Park&quot;.

The development group plans to build a park at half the size of the city&#x27;s original proposal, with mixed use towers taking up the remaining space.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
On March 23, 2020, a state of emergency was declared in Toronto by Tory, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This came six days after Ontario Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in the province, which included prohibition of all public events of over 50 people (later reduced to 5 people on March 28), closure of bars and restaurants (with the exception that restaurants could continue to provide takeout and delivery services) as well as libraries, theatres, cinemas, schools and daycares. On March 31, Tory announced that the City of Toronto would cancel all city-led major events, festivals, conferences, permits and cultural programs until June 30.

Beginning after Canada Day, street parking enforcement as well as fare evasion enforcement returned to Toronto and the Toronto Transit Commission respectively. From July 2, 2020, face masks or coverings were required to be worn on the TTC. After July 7, masks were required in enclosed, public places.

=== Strong-mayor powers ===
Prior to the 2022 election, at the request of Tory, Premier Doug Ford&#x27;s provincial government introduced legislation known as the &quot;Strong Mayors, Building More Homes Act, 2022&quot;, which granted Tory additional powers including the development of the budget, creating council committees, appointing the chairs and vice chairs of those committees, the power to reorganize departments, appointing department heads, and appointing the city manager. Tory was also granted the power to veto council decisions which do not align with priorities set by the province. On November 16, 2022, the province proposed further changes the powers of the mayor, introducing the &quot;Better Municipal Governance Act, 2022&quot; which would allow by-laws to be passed with only one-third of council voting in favour if Tory declared it to be in line with provincial priorities.

At a press conference, Tory stated that when speaking to the public, he often hears complaints relating to housing and community safety, but nobody has complained about the new powers. The mayor&#x27;s office has also said he would make very limited use of new powers. The Ford government defended the new powers by pointing out the mayor&#x27;s &quot;city-wide mandate&quot;, having received more votes than the rest of council. The &quot;National Post&quot;&#x27;s Adam Zivo argued that the mayor is just as legitimate as council and that the changes will increase Tory&#x27;s &quot;political capital and influence,&quot; which he can use to push for the city&#x27;s interests to other levels of government.

The new legislation was condemned by Toronto City Council, which had not been consulted on the changes, some of which were introduced after the election. All five living former Toronto mayors, David Crombie, David Miller, Barbara Hall, Art Eggleton and John Sewell, wrote a letter to Tory describing the new powers as an &quot;attack&quot; on local democracy and majority rule. Political science professors such as Harvard&#x27;s Pippa Norris and Laval&#x27;s Louis Massicotte were puzzled by the legislation, as no other democratic legislature in the world can pass laws with only one-third support. Critics urged Tory to reject some, or all, of the new powers as Ottawa mayor Mark Sutcliffe had done. &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; commentator Brian Lilley supported expanded powers for the mayor due to his city-wide mandate, but argued that those powers should not include minority rule. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;&#x27;s Marcus Gee questioned why Tory had chosen not revealed his plans to the public, and described the changes as &quot;offensive in principle and dangerous in practice&quot;. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot;&#x27;s editorial board also called on Tory to reject the new powers.

In December 2022, Tory asked the provincial government to amend the legislation to include a sunset clause after his term ends in 2026.

=== Taxes ===
Tory promised to keep property tax increases at or below the rate of inflation. He had previously made the same promise during the last municipal election and kept it as mayor.

=== Extramarital affair and resignation ===
On February 10, 2023, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; broke the news that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tory had a months-long affair with a former staffer that ended earlier in 2023. Through his lawyer, Tory described the relationship as a &quot;serious error of judgement&quot;. While no law prohibits politicians from having relationships with their staff, the &quot;Star&quot; questioned whether the relationship violated the city&#x27;s internal policies.

Tory announced at a press conference the same day that he would resign as Mayor of Toronto and committed to working with Deputy Mayor Jennifer McKelvie, City Manager Paul Johnson and City Clerk John D. Elvidge to ensure an &quot;orderly transition&quot;. He submitted his resignation letter to Elvidge on February 16, which states that his official last day would be February 17 at 5 p.m., after which McKelvie would assume certain mayoral powers until council arranged for a mayoral by-election. Former NDP MP Olivia Chow was elected to succeed Tory as mayor. Tory had endorsed his former deputy mayor Ana Bailão to succeed him. She finished second in the election.

== Post mayoralty ==
In December 2023, several months after he resigned as mayor, Tory joined Bell Media as a municipal affairs commentator appearing on CFRB as a commentator and substitute host as well as on CTV News and CP24. In March 2024, it was announced that Tory would rejoin the board of directors of Rogers, after being a member of the board between 2010 and 2014 prior to running for Mayor of Toronto.

==Personal life==
Tory has been married to Barbara Hackett, a home builder and renovator, since 1978. They met in 1976 at York University, where they both studied law and Hackett also studied business. Hackett was diagnosed with Guillain–Barré syndrome in 1991. They have four children.

Tory has two brothers, Michael and Jeffrey, and one sister, Jennifer. One of Tory&#x27;s ancestors, James Tory, was a soldier in the 71st Scottish Regiment. He was captured and held as a prisoner of war during the American Revolution. He later settled in Nova Scotia in the 1780s. His maternal grandmother, Helen Yvonne Solomon, was born in 1909 to a Russian Jewish family that had immigrated to Canada six years earlier and settled in Toronto. Helen Solomon married Howard English Bacon, an Anglican, and their daughter Elizabeth Bacon was raised a Christian and married Tory&#x27;s father, John A. Tory, in 1953.

==Honours==
In 2012, Tory was made a member of the Order of Ontario in recognition for being &quot;a consummate champion for the Greater Toronto Region as a founding member and chair of CivicAction and chairs and volunteers on countless fundraising campaigns&quot;. Tory is also a recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, and holds a commission as King&#x27;s Counsel. In 2011, Tory was awarded a Harry Jerome Award for his work as co-chair of DiverseCity.

<text>Angela May Rippon (born 12 October 1944) is an English broadcaster, former newsreader, writer and journalist. 

Rippon presented radio and television news programmes in South West England before moving to BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, becoming a regular presenter in 1975. She was the first female journalist to be given a permanent role presenting the BBC national television news, and the third female news presenter to appear on national broadcasts on British television, after Barbara Mandell on Independent Television News (ITN) in 1955, and Nan Winton, who temporarily presented the national news on BBC Television, in 1960.

Rippon appeared on a Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1976, presented the first two series of &quot;Top Gear&quot; and also presented &quot;Come Dancing&quot;. She hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 1977. She was a presenter on, and co-founder of, breakfast television franchisee TV-am. In the 1990s, she moved to radio, presenting daily news programmes for LBC Newstalk between 1990 and 1994, and appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; as a stand-in newsreader. She presented the BBC broadcast of the United Kingdom Ballroom Championships at the Bournemouth International Centre in 1991.

Rippon has written fourteen books, toured with a production of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; and presented a segment of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;. Since 2009, she has co-presented the BBC One consumer show &quot;Rip Off Britain&quot; with Gloria Hunniford and Julia Somerville; in 2013 and 2014 she hosted &quot;Holiday Hit Squad&quot; alongside Helen Skelton and Joe Crowley. She was also the voiceover for the BBC One game show &quot;The Wall&quot; and can currently be seen presenting occasionally on GB News.

==Early life==
Angela May Rippon was born on 12 October 1944 in Plymouth, Devon, into a working-class family. Her father, John, was a Royal Marine; she first saw him in 1947 when he returned from World War II. Rippon&#x27;s Scottish mother, Edna, worked at a fine china company called Lawley&#x27;s and was also a seamstress. She attended Public Secondary School for Girls, Cobourg Street in Plymouth.

==Career==
After leaving school at 17, Rippon joined the photographic office of the &quot;Western Morning News&quot; and worked for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, and later, BBC local radio and Westward Television as an editor.

===Television and radio===

In 1966, when she was 21, Rippon began her television career at BBC South West in Plymouth, before becoming a reporter for BBC TV news. Rippon first presented a national news programme on BBC2 in 1974. For a fortnight, she replaced newsreader Richard Baker – who was on holiday – on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;, and was offered a permanent newsreading role on that programme in 1975. 

Rippon was called by newspapers the first female television newsreader. However, ITN&#x27;s Barbara Mandell predated her, having first appeared on the second night of ITV in 1955; Nan Winton was the first female BBC newsreader in 1960, and Mary Marquis had already been BBC Scotland&#x27;s main newsreader for a few years. Rippon was the first female journalist to read the news regularly on national television.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she said: &quot;You just become an automated autocue reader and if you&#x27;ve half a brain you want an opportunity to use it. When I read the Nine O&#x27;Clock News, I kept my brain active by working on programmes like &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; (which she briefly hosted in 1979), &quot;Top Gear&quot; and &quot;In the Country&quot;.&quot; Rippon was a guest in the 1976 Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show, first appearing behind a BBC newsdesk, then emerging to perform a high-kicking dance routine. Her appearance was so popular she made a cameo appearance in the following year&#x27;s show, in which she was revealed to be one of a chorus line. Rippon later presented the long-running show &quot;Come Dancing&quot;.

Rippon hosted the 1977 Eurovision Song Contest at the Wembley Conference Centre in London. She was the first presenter of BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot;, presenting the motoring programme from 1977 to 1979. Rippon appeared briefly on TV-am following its launch in 1983. After a much publicised exit from TV-am (with most of its other founder presenters), she worked as an Arts and Entertainments correspondent for WHDH-TV (then known as WNEV) in Boston, Massachusetts for a brief period.

Rippon co-presented the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer on 29 July 1981 and BBC One&#x27;s coverage of the 1979 UK general election results. In the mid-1980s, she hosted the quiz show, &quot;Masterteam&quot; on BBC One, and hosted ITV&#x27;s revival of the panel game &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; from 1989 to 1990. In 1990, she also hosted a game show, &quot;Matchpoint&quot;, that was based on tennis format. She also became a regular presenter on BBC Radio 2, often sitting in for Jimmy Young and presenting a seasonal Friday night show from 1986 to 1989.

From 1990 to 1994, she presented &quot;Angela Rippon&#x27;s Morning Report&quot;, a daily radio news programme on LBC Newstalk, and, later, &quot;Angela Rippon&#x27;s Drivetime&quot;. She was a stand-in newsreader on Channel 4&#x27;s The Big Breakfast until 2002. In 2005, Rippon co-hosted a series of &quot;Sun, Sea and Bargain Spotting&quot; for BBC 2 and in April 2006, she toured the UK as a cast member of the musical &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. In 2007, she became a presenter on &quot;Cash in the Attic&quot;, a BBC One daytime television programme broadcast where presenters meet members of the general public, who seek out valuables and antiques to be sold at auction, in their homes.

In 1997, Rippon presented the Channel 4 show &quot;Game of War&quot; with co-presenter Paddy Griffith, a programme that re-enacted historic battles on the wargames table with modern-day military commanders re-fighting the battles. The show only aired for three episodes. The battles re-fought were Battle of Naseby (14 June 1645), Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815) and Battle of Balaklava (25 October 1854).

In 2010, Rippon appeared as a guest judge on the ITV show &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, covering for Robin Cousins. The following year, she returned to the show as a contestant in the sixth series on 9 January 2011, with her professional partner, Canadian ice skater Sean Rice, she failed to qualify for the competition and was eliminated alongside Nadia Sawalha and Mark Hanretty. In March 2011, she appeared with Lenny Henry, Samantha Womack and Reggie Yates in a BBC documentary to raise funds for Comic Relief. It was called &quot;Famous, Rich and in the Slums&quot;, and showed four celebrities travelling to Kibera in Kenya, Africa&#x27;s largest slum. In 2011 she joined &quot;The One Show&quot;, presenting a five-minute slot called &quot;Rippon&#x27;s Britain&quot;.

On 19 November 2011, Rippon appeared on Children in Need, performing alongside BBC newsreaders Sian Williams, Susanna Reid, Sophie Raworth, and Emily Maitlis in a special one-off edition of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. In the same month she worked briefly on BBC Radio 5 Live as a stand-in presenter on the &quot;Double Take&quot; programme.

Rippon joined the BBC again, as a co-presenter on the BBC One show &quot;Holiday Hit Squad&quot; in 2013, alongside Joe Crowley and Helen Skelton. The show returned for a second series in March 2014.

In 2014, Rippon co-hosted the ITV Saturday night entertainment series &quot;Amazing Greys&quot; alongside Paddy McGuinness. The show lasted for just one series. In April 2016, she co-presented the two-part BBC One series &quot;How to Stay Young&quot;.

In 2018, Rippon was a co-presenter of live coverage of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle for the Seven Network (Australia) alongside Michael Usher and Melissa Doyle.

In 2022, Rippon provided analysis on the Australian television broadcaster Seven Network&#x27;s coverage of the death and state funeral of Elizabeth II as a royal commentator. She has been a stand-in presenter on GB News, first alongside Eamonn Holmes on the breakfast programme, and then on Alistair Stewart and Friends.

In August 2023, it was announced that she would be taking part in the twenty-first series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, over thirty years after hosting the original version of the show &quot;Come Dancing&quot;. Rippon, who turned 79 whilst participating in the series, is the oldest contestant in the show&#x27;s history.

===Books===
In the early 1980s, Rippon put her name to a series of ghost-written children&#x27;s books about a character called &quot;Victoria Plum&quot; that was published by Purnell and Sons. Victoria Plum was a tree fairy in &quot;the Great Wood&quot;. Merchandise and a Christmas annual were released following the second series. In 1982, she wrote a book &quot;Mark Phillips, the Man and His Horses&quot;, about the Princess Royal&#x27;s then husband. Rippon has since written keep-fit guides for older people, including &quot;Stay Active, Stay Supple, Stay Healthy&quot;.

===Other activities===
Rippon is patron of the Old Time Dance Society. In 2010, she attended the society&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Ball of the Year. In 2000, Rippon was appointed Chair of English National Ballet. After several years of involvement, she resigned in late 2003 following complaints and briefings about her leadership style, which was described as &quot;schoolmistressy&quot; and &quot;imperious&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1967 at the age of 22, she married Christopher Dare, an engineer. They separated in 1989, divorcing later. They had no children. Rippon has said that her marriage ending was very painful, and that her celebrity status was one factor. She has had subsequent long-term relationships, but is happy being single. Rippon lives in Kensington, west London. She is a cousin of the former Darlington F.C. player Clive Nattress.

==Honours and awards==
She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1981 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews while signing copies of her newly published book in a store at the Brent Cross Shopping Centre.

Rippon was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours.

Rippon was also awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from Plymouth University in 2012.

She was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to dementia care in her role as development lead with Dementia Friendly Communities.

<text>Clinton Presba Anderson (October 23, 1895 – November 11, 1975) was an American politician who represented New Mexico in the United States Senate from 1949 until 1973. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as United States Secretary of Agriculture from 1945 until 1948 and represented New Mexico&#x27;s at-large congressional district from 1941 until 1945.

==Early life and education==
Anderson was born in Centerville, South Dakota, on October 23, 1895. His parents were Andrew Jay and Hattie Belle Anderson (née Presba). He was educated in the public school system of South Dakota and attended Dakota Wesleyan University (1913–1915) and the University of Michigan (1915–1916) but did not receive a degree from either institution.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
After his father broke his back in 1916, Anderson left the University of Michigan to go home to help to support his family. He worked for several months for a newspaper in Mitchell, South Dakota, until he became seriously ill with tuberculosis. He was not aware of his illness until he attempted to join the US military in 1917 upon America&#x27;s entrance into World War I. Doctors gave him six months to live. One gave him the advice to check himself into the Methodist Sanitarium in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He promptly did so, and while recovering there, he occasionally wrote for the &quot;Albuquerque Herald&quot;.

In 1919, as soon as he was well enough to leave the sanitarium, he gained employment with the &quot;Albuquerque Morning Journal&quot;, now called the &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot;, and he was sent to Santa Fe to cover the New Mexico Legislature. Very critical of how the Republican Party was running the state, he befriended some New Mexico Democratic legislators and gave them his ideas on bills before the legislature. Some of the ideas eventually became state law, and Anderson began a lifelong association with the Democratic Party.

His long career of public service began as executive secretary of the New Mexico Public Health Association in 1919. There, he raised money to fight tuberculosis, established county health programs, and was instrumental in founding the New Mexico Department of Health.

In the early 1920s, Anderson pursued private business affairs. In 1922, he started in the insurance business with the New Mexico Loan and Mortgage Company. Anderson was soon able to buy the business and change the name to the Clinton P. Anderson Agency, a successful and enduring enterprise.

Actively involved in the Rotary Club of Albuquerque since 1919, he was elected to the International Board in 1930 and became president of Rotary International in 1932, a position that introduced him to many business and political contacts.

=== New Mexico government and politics ===
Anderson returned to public life, becoming chairman of the New Mexico Democratic Party in 1928 and state treasurer of New Mexico in 1933. That was followed by appointments as director of the Bureau of Revenue, relief administrator for the State of New Mexico, Western States Field Coordinator for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, State Director of the National Youth Administration, chairman of the New Mexico Unemployment Security Division, and managing director of the Coronado Cuarto Centennial Commission, among others. It was Anderson&#x27;s style to take on a newly created position or an emergency situation, to organize it, and then to leave when he felt that all was running smoothly.

In 1940, a conflict among members of the state Democratic Party resulted in Congressman John J. Dempsey being disqualified from running for another term as New Mexico&#x27;s only representative. Party members convinced Anderson to run for the seat, which he won by using his many business and political contacts throughout the state. For the next three decades, he divided his time between Albuquerque and Washington, D.C.

Anderson became known for his thorough investigative work, and during his three terms in the House of Representatives, he was assigned to several special committees, including the chairmanship of the Special Committee to Investigate Food Shortages in 1945. The committee argued for a streamlined food distribution system and emphasized long-range planning for increasing food production. His success in that assignment, along with their personal friendship, led to his appointment by President Harry S. Truman as United States secretary of agriculture.

===Truman administration===

Shortly after Harry S. Truman became president in 1945, he selected Anderson to serve as his Secretary of Agriculture. His most immediate concern was the reorganization of the domestic agricultural economy, which for the previous four years, had been focused on supporting the American war effort in the Second World War. Anderson addressed issues such as price controls, shortages, and subsidies, and he played an important role in developing postwar agricultural policies.

The domestic situation was only one of Anderson&#x27;s concerns as Secretary of Agriculture. The looming worldwide food crisis, which was becoming more evident by 1946, led President Truman to establish the Famine Emergency Committee.

Anderson made two controversial moves to change the drastic problems. Firstly, he used his organizational skills to incorporate all existing food and agricultural activities under his office. Secondly, he advised Truman to enlist former President Herbert Hoover to serve as chairman of the Famine Emergency Committee. During the crisis, Anderson, Truman, and Hoover worked together very closely. Many of Hoover&#x27;s proposals on alleviating the international food shortage were adopted by the Truman administration, and it became Anderson&#x27;s responsibility to implement the proposals. The three men can be credited with preventing an even larger international disaster.

U.S. food production and worldwide distribution was stabilized by 1948, and Anderson decided to retire from the Cabinet. As with every project he had undertaken, Anderson left after he had resolved the problems faced.

===U.S. Senate===
====Election====

Anderson considered retiring altogether after resigning from the cabinet. However, state Democrats, led by retiring Senator Carl Hatch, convinced Anderson to run for Hatch&#x27;s seat against the formidable and distinguished diplomat Patrick J. Hurley.

The two well-established candidates faced off in one of the most heated campaigns of the 1948 election. The nationwide campaigning of the Truman administration against an &#x27;obstructionist&#x27; Republican Congress made Republicans lose across the country, including Hurley.

Anderson&#x27;s re-election in 1954 against former Governor of New Mexico Edwin L. Mechem was less heated but more significant because the Democrats had lost the Senate in 1952. Anderson prevailed, with the Democrats regaining control of the Senate, and went on to be re-elected by wide margins in 1960 and 1966.

==== Accomplishments ====
Anderson sponsored the final wilderness bill, which passed the Senate by a vote of 73–12 on April 9, 1963, passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 373–1 on July 30, 1964, and it was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964. Richard McArdle, chief of the Forest Service from 1952 to 1962, remarked: &quot;Without Clinton Anderson there would have been no Wilderness Law.&quot;

Anderson is also known for the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act, as well as for forcing cancellation of the 1954 Dixon-Yates contract with the AEC for power from the TVA for the city of Memphis.

Anderson also served as chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (84th and 86th Congresses), Joint Committee on Construction of Building for Smithsonian (84th-92nd), Joint Committee on Navaho-Hopi Indians (84th-92nd), Special Committee on Preservation of Senate Records (85th and 86th, Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (87th and 88th), Special Committee on National Fuel Policy (87th).

===Failed confirmation of Lewis Strauss===
In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated Lewis Strauss to serve as Secretary of Commerce. Previously, Strauss had served in numerous government positions in the administrations of Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. The previous 13 nominees for the Cabinet position had won Senate confirmation in an average of eight days. Because of both personal and professional disagreements, Anderson took up the cause to make sure that Strauss would not be confirmed by the Senate. Anderson found an ally in Senator Gale W. McGee on the Senate Commerce Committee, which had jurisdiction over Strauss&#x27;s confirmation. During and after the Senate hearings, McGee charged Strauss with &quot;a brazen attempt to hoodwink&quot; the committee. 
After 16 days of hearings the committee recommended Strauss&#x27;s confirmation to the full Senate by a vote of 9–8. In preparation for the floor debate on the nomination, the Democratic majority&#x27;s main argument against the nomination was that Strauss&#x27;s statements before the committee were &quot;sprinkled with half truths and even lies... and that under rough and hostile questioning, [he] can be evasive and quibblesome.&quot;

Despite an overwhelming Democratic majority, the 86th United States Congress was not able to accomplish much of its agenda since the President had immense popularity and a veto pen. With the 1960 elections nearing, congressional Democrats sought issues on which they could conspicuously oppose the Republican administration. The Strauss nomination proved to be tailor-made.

Just after midnight on June 19, 1959, the Strauss nomination failed by a vote of 46–49. It marked only the eighth time in U.S. history that a Cabinet appointee had failed to be confirmed by the Senate.

===Support for space program===
During his tenure, Anderson was one of the most outspoken proponents of the U.S. space program. He was instrumental in gaining funding for the program while chairing the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences from 1963 to 1973. As chairman of the committee during the most active period of space exploration and the most important time of the space race, Anderson held a key policy-making role in Washington, not to mention the purse strings for NASA.

In 1967, Anderson chaired the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences that investigated the NASA Apollo 1 accident. Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans, Administrator James E. Webb, Manned Space Flight Administrator Dr. George E. Mueller, and Apollo Program Director Maj Gen Samuel C. Phillips were all called to testify before Anderson&#x27;s committee, which also featured extensive questioning by Senator Walter Mondale.

== Personal life ==
On June 22, 1921, Anderson married the former Henrietta McCartney, and the couple returned home to Albuquerque. They had two children together: Sherburne Presba Anderson; and Nancy Anderson.

On January 3, 1973, due to his age and growing health problems, Anderson retired after having served four terms in the U.S. Senate.

On November 11, 1975, just two years later, Anderson died at his home in Albuquerque from a massive stroke, at the age of 80. He was buried at Fairview Memorial Park in Albuquerque. His wife, Henrietta McCartney Anderson, died nearly two decades later, on June 7, 1994, at the age of 94.

=== Legacy ===
In 1977, Anderson was posthumously inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame.

In the Tom Hanks miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; (1998), which aired on HBO, Anderson was played by Mason Adams.

<doc id="555462" wikidata="Q930957" url="?curid=555462" title="Marco Evaristti">
<text>Marco Evaristti (born 1963) is a Chilean artist who has lived in Denmark since the 1980s. While a trained and practicing architect, he is best known for hosting a dinner party where the main course was agnolotti pasta that was topped with a meatball made with his own fat, removed earlier in the year in a liposuction operation.

==Early life==
Though raised a Catholic, in his teenage years Evaristti found out he was born to a Jewish mother, which some account for the philosophical and religious themes in his work. Evaristti holds a master&#x27;s degree in architecture from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where he was a student of architect Henning Larsen. Through the years, he has continued working on private architectural projects as well as larger commission projects.

==Architecture==
His architecture works contain a blend of Scandinavian, Asian and Latin American approaches. He travels to other countries and embellishes the natural environment with coloured dye as part of an ongoing project he calls &quot;Pink State&quot;. Evaristti sometimes uses materials taken from nature, such as diamonds, gold, semen and blood, to create a psychological reaction in the viewer.

===Pink State===
Evaristti describes Pink State as his own independent state, a state of mind with passport and constitution, but without government control. Although imaginary, he will materialize it from time to time in his transitory landscape works. Pink State is Evaristti&#x27;s, but without controlled or controlling borders. Manifestations of Pink State have included 2004&#x27;s The Ice Cube Project off Greenland, 2007&#x27;s attempted painting of the summit of Mont Blanc (The Mont Rouge Project) in France, and 2008&#x27;s Arido Rosso Project in the Sahara. All these projects, at their core, deal with issues of territorial power and brotherhood.

==Works==
In 1995, Evaristti was a visiting professor in Bangkok at the Silipakorn Fine Arts University. While in Bangkok, he witnessed over thirty road casualties every day, and accompanied investigators to several accidents. Here he acquired blood and other materials from some of the scenes, and used them with ink to paint on canvases. In this way, he was trying to create an image of what disaster might look like. The most important element was the use of real blood. Evaristti quoted Picasso that art is a representation of reality expressed through a lie. However, in these paintings the blood is real and thus not a lie. He titled the piece &quot;Crash&quot;.

After studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Evaristti gained notoriety for a museum display entitled &quot;Helena&quot; in 2000 that featured ten functional blenders containing live goldfish. The display, at the Trapholt Art Museum in Kolding, Denmark, invited guests to turn on the blenders. This led to museum director Peter Meyers being charged with and, later, acquitted of animal cruelty.

In 2001, Evaristti worked on his project &quot;Terrorialista&quot;, which is a silver-patina bronze sculpture made up of twenty-eight parts that together form a complete human body. The pieces are all based on photographic images of human bodies that were blown apart by acts of terror by both sides of the conflict. The allegiances, gender, nationality, religion and every other feature that had identified the people in those photographs was now eradicated. Parts of this work are further explained in the Pink State.

Evaristti&#x27;s next major work, in 2004, entitled &quot;Ice Cube Project&quot;, was to paint the exposed tip of a small iceberg red. This took place on March 24, in Kangia fjord near Ilullissat, Greenland. With two icebreakers and a twenty-man crew, Evaristti used three fire hoses and 3,000 litres (790 US gallons) of paint to color the iceberg blood-red. The artist commented that, &quot;We all have a need to decorate Mother Nature because it belongs to all of us.&quot;

On January 13, 2007, Evaristti hosted a dinner party where the main course was agnolotti pasta that was topped with a meatball made with his own fat, removed earlier in the year in a liposuction operation.

On June 8, 2007, Evaristti draped the peak of Mont Blanc in France with red fabric, along with a 20-foot pole with a flag reading &quot;Pink State&quot;. He had been arrested and detained on June 6 for attempting to paint the peak red. He has stated that his aim is to raise awareness of environmental degradation.

In 2009, Evaristti exhibited his &quot;Body Bags&quot; project. This consisted of three body bags cast in bronze, each in a different color, to symbolize the three main monotheistic religions. He claimed the body bags were like the modern-day image of the skull and reminded people how fragile human life was. By making each resemble a different religion, he was trying to enforce the idea that no matter what ideas you believe in, your life will still end in death.

On January 27, 2010, Evaristti exhibited his artwork &quot;Rolexgate&quot; which is a model of the entrance gate to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. 80% of the model is made up of gold which comes from the teeth of Jews who died in the concentration camps. The model had been briefly exhibited in Berlin, but was removed because of the audience reaction.

In 2010, Evaristti created his &quot;Boxing Bag&quot; project, in which he replaced boxing bags&#x27; sand stuffing with hair cut from Christians, Jews, and Muslims. He invited viewers to nudge certain bags aside to get through the pathway. He suggested that a viewer who hit certain bags had a vendetta against that religion.

In March 2013, Evaristti painted a frozen waterfall in Hovden, Aust-Agder, Norway red with fruit juice.

In November 2022, Evaristti had his first solo show in Thailand at West Eden in conjunction with a concurrent show in Copenhagen with Galleri Christoffer Egelund.

<text>In scientific writing, IMRAD or IMRaD () (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) is a common organizational structure for the format of a document. IMRaD is the most prominent norm for the structure of a scientific journal article of the original research type.

==Overview==

Original research articles are typically structured in this basic order
*Introduction – Why was the study undertaken? What was the research question, the tested hypothesis or the purpose of the research?
*Methods – When, where, and how was the study done? What materials were used or who was included in the study groups (patients, etc.)?
*Results – What answer was found to the research question; what did the study find? Was the tested hypothesis true?
*Discussion – What might the answer imply and why does it matter? How does it fit in with what other researchers have found? What are the perspectives for future research?

The plot and the flow of the story of the IMRaD style of writing are explained by a &#x27;wine glass model&#x27; or hourglass model.

Writing, compliant with IMRaD format (IMRaD writing) typically first presents &quot;(a) the subject that positions the study from the wide perspective&quot;, &quot;(b) outline of the study&quot;, develops through &quot;(c) study method&quot;, and &quot;(d) the results&quot;, and concludes with &quot;(e) outline and conclusion of the fruit of each topics&quot;, and &quot;(f) the meaning of the study from the wide and general point of view&quot;. Here, (a) and (b) are mentioned in the section of the &quot;Introduction&quot;, (c) and (d) are mentioned in the section of the &quot;Method&quot; and &quot;Result&quot; respectively, and (e) and (f) are mentioned in the section of the &quot;Discussion&quot; or &quot;Conclusion&quot;.

In this sense, to explain how to line up the information in IMRaD writing, the &#x27;wine glass model&#x27; (see the pattern diagram shown in Fig.1) will be helpful (see pp 2–3 of the Hilary Glasman-deal ). As mentioned in abovementioned textbook, the scheme of &#x27;wine glass model&#x27; has two characteristics. The first one is &quot;top-bottom symmetric shape&quot;, and the second one is &quot;changing width&quot; i.e. &quot;the top is wide and it narrows towards the middle, and then widens again as it goes down toward the bottom&quot;. 
The First one, &quot;top-bottom symmetric shape&quot;, represents the symmetry of the story development. Note the shape of the top trapezoid (representing the structure of Introduction) and the shape of the trapezoid at the bottom are reversed. This is expressing that the same subject introduced in Introduction will be taken up again in suitable formation for the section of Discussion/Conclusion in these section in the reversed order. (See the relationship between abovementioned (a), (b) and (e), (f).)

The Second one, &quot;the change of the width&quot; of the schema shown in Fig.1, represents the change of generality of the view point. As along the flow of the story development, when the viewpoints are more general, the width of the diagram is expressed wider, and when they are more specialized and focused, the width is expressed narrower.

===As the standard format of academic journals===
The IMRAD format has been adopted by a steadily increasing number of academic journals since the first half of the 20th century. The IMRAD structure has come to dominate academic writing in the sciences, most notably in empirical biomedicine. The structure of most public health journal articles reflects this trend. Although the IMRAD structure originates in the empirical sciences, it now also regularly appears in academic journals across a wide range of disciplines. Many scientific journals now not only prefer this structure but also use the IMRAD acronym as an instructional device in the instructions to their authors, recommending the use of the four terms as main headings. For example, it is explicitly recommended in the &quot;Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals&quot; issued by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (previously called the &quot;Vancouver guidelines&quot;): 
The text of observational and experimental articles is usually (but not necessarily) divided into the following sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. This so-called &quot;IMRAD&quot; structure is not an arbitrary publication format but rather a direct reflection of the process of scientific discovery. Long articles may need subheadings within some sections (especially Results and Discussion) to clarify their content. Other types of articles, such as case reports, reviews, and editorials, probably need to be formatted differently.
The IMRAD structure is also recommended for empirical studies in the 6th edition of the publication manual of the American Psychological Association (APA style). The APA publication manual is widely used by journals in the social, educational and behavioral sciences.

==Benefits==
The IMRAD structure has proved successful because it facilitates literature review, allowing readers to navigate articles more quickly to locate material relevant to their purpose. But the neat order of IMRAD rarely corresponds to the actual sequence of events or ideas of the research presented; the IMRAD structure effectively supports a reordering that eliminates unnecessary detail, and allows the reader to assess a well-ordered and noise-free presentation of the relevant and significant information. It allows the most relevant information to be presented clearly and logically to the readership, by summarizing the research process in an ideal sequence and without unnecessary detail.

==Caveats==
The idealised sequence of the IMRAD structure has on occasion been criticised for being too rigid and simplistic. In a radio talk in 1964 the Nobel laureate Peter Medawar criticised this text structure for not giving a realistic representation of the thought processes of the writing scientist: &quot;… the scientific paper may be a fraud because it misrepresents the processes of thought that accompanied or gave rise to the work that is described in the paper&quot;. Medawar&#x27;s criticism was discussed at the XIXth General Assembly of the World Medical Association in 1965. While respondents may argue that it is too much to ask from such a simple instructional device to carry the burden of representing the entire process of scientific discovery, Medawar&#x27;s caveat expressed his belief that many students and faculty throughout academia treat the structure as a simple panacea. Medawar and others have given testimony both to the importance and to the limitations of the device.

==Abstract considerations==
In addition to the scientific article itself, a brief abstract is usually required for publication. The abstract should, however, be composed to function as an autonomous text, even if some authors and readers may think of it as an almost integral part of the article. The increasing importance of well-formed autonomous abstracts may well be a consequence of the increasing use of searchable digital abstract archives, where a well-formed abstract will dramatically increase the probability for an article to be found by its optimal readership. Consequently, there is a strong recent trend toward developing formal requirements for abstracts, most often structured on the IMRAD pattern, and often with strict additional specifications of topical content items that should be considered for inclusion in the abstract. Such abstracts are often referred to as structured abstracts. The growing importance of abstracts in the era of computerized literature search and information overload has led some users to modify the IMRAD acronym to AIMRAD, in order to give due emphasis to the abstract.

==Heading style variations==
Usually, the IMRAD article sections use the IMRAD words as s. A few variations can occur, as follows: 
* Many journals have a convention of omitting the &quot;Introduction&quot; heading, based on the idea that the reader who begins reading an article does not need to be told that the beginning of the text is the introduction. This print-era proscription is fading since the advent of the Web era, when having an explicit &quot;Introduction&quot; heading helps with navigation via document maps and collapsible/expandable TOC trees. (The same considerations are true regarding the presence or proscription of an explicit &quot;Abstract&quot; heading.)
* In some journals, the &quot;Methods&quot; heading may vary, being &quot;Methods and materials&quot;, &quot;Materials and methods&quot;, or similar phrases. Some journals mandate that exactly the same wording for this heading be used for all articles without exception; other journals reasonably accept whatever each submitted manuscript contains, as long as it is one of these sensible variants.
* The &quot;Discussion&quot; section may any &quot;Summary&quot;, &quot;Conclusion&quot;, or &quot;Conclusions&quot; section, in which case there may or may not be any explicit &quot;Summary&quot;, &quot;Conclusion&quot;, or &quot;Conclusions&quot; ; or the &quot;Summary&quot;/&quot;Conclusion&quot;/&quot;Conclusions&quot; section may be a separate section, using an explicit heading on the same heading hierarchy level as the &quot;Discussion&quot; heading. Which of these variants to use as the default is a matter of each journal&#x27;s chosen style, as is the question of whether the default style must be forced onto every article or whether sensible inter-article flexibility will be allowed. The journals which use the &quot;Conclusion&quot; or &quot;Conclusions&quot; along with a statement about the &quot;Aim&quot; or &quot;Objective&quot; of the study in the &quot;Introduction&quot; is following the newly proposed acronym &quot;IaMRDC&quot; which stands for &quot;Introduction with aim, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion.&quot;

==Other elements that are typical although not part of the acronym==
* Disclosure statements (&quot;see main article at conflicts of interest in academic publishing&quot;)
** Reader&#x27;s theme that is the point of this element&#x27;s existence: &quot;Why should I (the reader) trust or believe what you (the author) say? Are you just making money off of saying it?&quot;
** Appear either in opening footnotes or a section of the article body
** Subtypes of disclosure:
*** Disclosure of funding (grants to the project)
*** Disclosure of conflict of interest (grants to individuals, jobs/salaries, stock or stock options)
* Clinical relevance statement 
** Reader&#x27;s theme that is the point of this element&#x27;s existence: &quot;Why should I (the reader) spend my time reading what you say? How is it relevant to my clinical practice? Basic research is nice, other people&#x27;s cases are nice, but my time is triaged, so make your case for &#x27;why bother&#x27;&quot;
** Appear either as a display element (sidebar) or a section of the article body
** Format: short, a few sentences or bullet points
* Ethical compliance statement 
** Reader&#x27;s theme that is the point of this element&#x27;s existence: &quot;Why should I believe that your study methods were ethical?&quot;
** &quot;We complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.&quot;
** &quot;We got our study design approved by our local institutional review board before proceeding.&quot;
** &quot;We got our study design approved by our local ethics committee before proceeding.&quot;
** &quot;We treated our animals in accordance with our local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.&quot;
* Diversity, equity, and inclusion statement 
** Reader&#x27;s theme that is the point of this element&#x27;s existence: &quot;Why should I believe that your study methods consciously included people?&quot; (for example, avoided inadvertently underrepresenting some people—participants or researchers—by race, ethnicity, sex, gender, or other factors) 
** &quot;We worked to ensure that people of color and transgender people were not underrepresented among the study population.&quot; 
** &quot;One or more of the authors of this paper self-identifies as living with a disability.&quot; 
** &quot;One or more of the authors of this paper self-identifies as transgender.&quot;

==Additional standardization (reporting guidelines)==

In the late 20th century and early 21st, the scientific communities found that the communicative value of journal articles was still much less than it could be if best practices were developed, promoted, and enforced. Thus reporting guidelines (guidelines for how best to report information) arose. The general theme has been to create templates and checklists with the message to the user being, &quot;your article is not complete until you have done all of these things.&quot; In the 1970s, the ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) released the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals (Uniform Requirements or URM). Other such standards, mostly developed in the 1990s through 2010s, are listed below. The academic medicine community is working hard on trying to raise compliance with good reporting standards, but there is still much to be done; for example, a 2016 review of instructions for authors in 27 emergency medicine journals found insufficient mention of reporting standards, and a 2018 study found that even when journals&#x27; instructions for authors mention reporting standards, there is a difference between a mention or badge and enforcing the requirements that the mention or badge represents.

The advent of a need for best practices in data sharing has expanded the scope of these efforts beyond merely the pages of the journal article itself. In fact, from the most rigorous versions of the evidence-based perspective, the distance to go is still quite formidable. FORCE11 is an international coalition that has been developing standards for how to share research data sets properly and most effectively. 

Most researchers cannot be familiar with all of the many reporting standards that now exist, but it is enough to know which ones must be followed in one&#x27;s own work, and to know where to look for details when needed. Several organizations provide help with this task of checking one&#x27;s own compliance with the latest standards: 
* The EQUATOR Network
* The BioSharing collaboration (biosharing.org)

Several important webpages on this topic are: 
* NLM&#x27;s list at Research Reporting Guidelines and Initiatives: By Organization 
* The EQUATOR Network&#x27;s list at Reporting guidelines and journals: fact &amp; fiction
* TRANSPOSE (Transparency in Scholarly Publishing for Open Scholarship Evolution), &quot;a grassroots initiative to build a crowdsourced database of journal policies,&quot; allowing faster and easier lookup and comparison, and potentially spurring harmonization

Relatedly, SHERPA provides compliance-checking tools, and AllTrials provides a rallying point, for efforts to enforce openness and completeness of clinical trial reporting. These efforts stand against publication bias and against excessive corporate influence on scientific integrity.

<text>Guillaume Amontons (31 August 1663 – 11 October 1705) was a French scientific instrument inventor and physicist. He was one of the pioneers in studying the problem of friction, which is the resistance to motion when bodies make contact. He is also known for his work on thermodynamics, the concept of absolute zero, and early engine design.

==Life==
Guillaume was born in Paris, France. His father was a lawyer from Normandy who had moved to the French capital. While still young, Guillaume lost his hearing and became mostly deaf. According to one biographer, Fontenelle, while studying perpetual motion, he became convinced of the importance of studying machines from a mathematical perspective. He never attended a university, but was able to study mathematics, the physical sciences, and celestial mechanics. He also spent time studying the skills of drawing, surveying, and architecture. He died in Paris, France.

==Work==
He was supported in his research career by the government, and was employed in various public works projects.

Among his contributions to scientific instrumentation were improvements to the barometer (1695), hygrometer (1687), and thermometer (1695), particularly for use of these instruments at sea. He also demonstrated an optical telegraph and proposed the use of his clepsydra (water clock) for keeping time on a ship at sea.

===Thermodynamics===
Amontons investigated the relationship between pressure and temperature in gases though he lacked accurate and precise thermometers. Though his results were at best semi-quantitative, he established that the pressure of a gas increases by roughly one-third between the temperatures of &quot;cold&quot; and the boiling point of water. This was a substantial step towards the subsequent gas laws and, in particular, Gay-Lussac&#x27;s law. His work led him to speculate that a sufficient reduction in temperature would lead to the disappearance of pressure. Though he came close to finding absolute zero - the theoretical temperature by which the volume of air in his air-thermometer will be reduced to nothing (estimated by him as −240° on the Celsius scale), the discovery would not be complete until at least a century later.

Guillaume Amontons is also the inventor of the hot air engine. In 1699, he built his first engine, more than a century earlier than the well-known Stirling engine. This engine, named by Amontons a &quot;fire mill&quot; (&quot;moulin à feu&quot;) followed a new thermodynamic cycle, which later became known as the Stirling cycle.

The fire mill is a wheel that makes use of the expansion of heated air to generate motive power. The calculated power of Amontons&#x27; fire mill was 39 HP, equal to the power of the most powerful hot air engines of the 19th century (with the exception of the &quot;caloric engine&quot; of Ericsson).
The main difference between Amontons&#x27; engine and the hot air engines of the 19th century was the nature of the piston (Amontons used water) and the use of rotational motion instead of alternating motion.

===Friction===

In 1699, Amontons published his rediscovery of the laws of friction first put forward by Leonardo da Vinci. Though they were received with some skepticism, the laws were verified by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb in 1781. For this contribution, Amontons was named as one of the 23 &quot;Men of Tribology&quot; by Duncan Dowson.

==Amontons&#x27; laws of friction==
Amontons-Coulomb laws of friction:
# The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load. (Amontons&#x27; 1st law)
# The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact. (Amontons&#x27; 2nd law)
# Kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity. (Coulomb&#x27;s law)
The first and second laws, which were founded by Amontons, and the third law, which was founded by Coulomb later, are called the Amontons-Coulomb laws of friction. (These 3 laws only apply to dry friction; the addition of a lubricant modifies the tribological properties significantly.)

The laws are shown by the classic example of a brick resting on an inclined plane, where it is in equilibrium and thus motionless. The force of gravity is opposed by static friction and as the angle of tilt of the plane is increased, the brick will eventually start to move downwards as gravity overcomes the frictional resistance. 

Coulomb later found deviations from Amontons’ laws in some cases. In systems with significant non-uniformity of the stress field, because local slip occurs before the entire system slides, Amontons’ laws are not satisfied macroscopically.

<text>Hurricane Juan was a significant tropical cyclone which caused extensive damage to parts of Atlantic Canada, being the tenth named storm and the sixth hurricane of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Juan formed southeast of Bermuda on September 24 from a tropical wave that had tracked across the subtropical Atlantic Ocean. It tracked northward and strengthened over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, reaching Category 2 strength on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale on September 27. The hurricane peaked in intensity with sustained winds of that same day, losing some strength as it raced over cooler waters toward the coast of Nova Scotia, before making landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect in the Halifax Regional Municipality early on September 29 as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of . Juan retained hurricane strength while travelling through Nova Scotia, though it would weaken into a Category 1 hurricane over Prince Edward Island. Juan would eventually be absorbed by another extratropical low on September 29 near Anticosti Island in the northern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

Juan would inflict extensive damage across central Nova Scotia and into Prince Edward Island, with lesser damage east and west of the storm centre. Most of the damage occurred as a result of the intense winds that buffeted the region. Juan&#x27;s passage resulted in eight fatalities and over CA $300 million (US$200 million) in damage. It was described as the worst storm to hit Halifax since 1893. On account of its destructiveness, the name &quot;Juan&quot; was retired from further use in the North Atlantic basin in 2004.

==Meteorological history==

A large tropical wave accompanied by a broad area of low pressure moved off the coast of Africa on September 14, 2003. It initially tracked westward and remained disorganized due to unfavourable upper-level wind shear. On September 20, the convection around the system greatly increased during interaction with the circulation of a large upper-level low, though unfavorable conditions caused the activity to remain disorganized. The system as a whole moved to the northwest around the upper-level low and developed a mid-level circulation. It interacted with a frontal zone, and became better organized on September 23 while located south of Bermuda. Later that day, a low-level circulation developed within the system, though its involvement with the proximate frontal zone prevented it from being classified a tropical depression. Deep convection increased near the centre on September 24, and the system quickly developed banding features and distinct outflow. Based on the increase in organization, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) classified it as Tropical Depression Fifteen later that day while it was located about southeast of Bermuda. Operationally, the agency did not initiate storm advisories until 27 hours after the time of its formation determined by post-hurricane season analysis.

Initially, the depression possessed a combination of tropical and subtropical characteristics; it remained attached to a nearby frontal zone, though the organization of the convection and a warm core within the system resulted in classification as a tropical cyclone. Forecasters had predicted the depression would only slowly strengthen and reach a peak intensity of . However, the depression steadily organized and had strengthened into Tropical Storm Juan by early September 25. Juan moved northwestward at around in response to a developing subtropical ridge to its east. On September 26, an eye feature developed, and very deep convection increased around the circulation. The cloud pattern continued to consolidate, and Juan attained hurricane status later on September 26 while located southeast of Bermuda. The hurricane moved into an area of warm waters and light wind shear, allowing for additional strengthening; by September 27, Juan had attained a peak intensity of while located south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. At this peak strength, the eye of the hurricane was distinct and embedded within a well-defined and round central dense overcast.
Hurricane Juan remained at peak intensity for over 24 hours. After moving northwestward for an extended period of time, it turned and accelerated to the north. The eye became less distinct on September 28, and the hurricane weakened slightly. Due to its fast forward motion, Juan had little time to weaken over significantly colder waters before making landfall between Shad Bay and Prospect (near Halifax) on September 29 with winds of . It weakened quickly while rapidly moving across the southern Canadian Maritimes and crossing the Nova Scotia peninsula as a hurricane. Juan had diminished to a tropical storm as it moved over Prince Edward Island by early September 29. The storm tracked northwards across the Northumberland Strait, making landfall near the community of Borden-Carleton and crossed Prince Edward Island in less than an hour. Later that afternoon, the storm was absorbed by a large extratropical low over the northwestern Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

==Preparations==
The first advisories were issued by the Canadian Hurricane Centre on September 26, although at that time they broadly suggested the possibility existed for wind and rain across Atlantic Canada. As Juan approached on September 27, warning broadcasts on local media in Atlantic Canada were changed accordingly. The public and emergency officials in the expected landfall area were told to make preparations for a potential disaster, after the CHC bulletins indicated the possibility existed for significant wind damage and flooding from both heavy rain and storm surges, as well as power outages.

On the morning of September 28, reports indicated that Juan would make landfall either as a tropical storm or marginal Category 1 hurricane. Weather broadcasts up to that time gave every indication that the storm would weaken prior to landfall. By 6 p.m. ADT (2100 UTC), additional warnings had been issued since Juan was expected to make landfall as a strong Category 1 or weak Category 2 hurricane. Most businesses in the areas affected were closed on Sundays, which meant that preparations could not be made at the last minute. Although no large-scale evacuations were made, local evacuations for low-lying areas were issued on the evening of September 28. In all, several hundred people were affected by these evacuations. Utility workers also stood on standby before the storm hit, preparing for large-scale power outages.

==Impact==

===Nova Scotia===

Hurricane Juan&#x27;s maximum sustained wind speed at landfall in Nova Scotia was measured at . The urban concentration surrounding Halifax Harbour bore the brunt of the highest sustained winds and strongest wind gusts during the storm; some unofficial estimates have placed gusts as high as . Wave-rider weather buoys off the entrance of Halifax Harbour snapped their moorings after reportedly recording waves in excess of . Significant erosion occurred on the populated shores of the harbour, particularly in the Bedford Basin where residential properties and railway tracks received most of the wave action. Storm surges of were reported in the harbour; it was the highest surge ever recorded in Halifax Harbour. Rainfall was fairly light due to the fast movement and dry air on the southern side of the storm. There were no rainfall reports greater than .

Juan caused widespread structural and vegetation damage across the region, particularly in and around the Halifax Regional Municipality. Extensive damage to trees was reported, which blocked many streets and knocked down power lines. Many homes and businesses suffered property damage, particularly roof damage on structures, and some weaker structures were destroyed. HRM estimated that 31% of residential homes suffered some degree of damage and 27% of homes had enough damage to warrant an insurance claim. In Downtown Halifax, erosion-control boulders the size of garbage cans were hurled from Halifax Harbour onto boardwalks and parking lots and piers. The Victoria General Hospital experienced roof and water damage and was evacuated during the storm, as were numerous tall apartment buildings and other multi-family residences. Billboards and signs were also destroyed, and dozens of vehicles were crushed by trees and other debris. The city&#x27;s cherished Point Pleasant Park and Public Gardens suffered massive loss of trees and remained closed for months.
Juan set an all-time maximum wind gust speed record at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport; during the peak of the storm, a gust reached 143 km/h, a record which still stands to this day. Another high windspeed occurred at the McNabs Island autostation, which recorded a 2-minute sustained wind of 151 km/h, with gusts to 176 km/h. Hurricane-force gusts extended as far east as Beaver Island, where gusts reached 132 km/h. The hurricane was strong enough to destroy the anemometers at Shannon Hill, Chebucto Head and Sambro Island, even though the Sambro Island instrument had survived a 193 km/h storm some years earlier.

The hurricane caused severe damage to shipping in Halifax Harbour. A visiting recreational schooner named &quot;Larinda&quot; was sunk at the wharf beside the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and a harbour tour ketch &quot;Mar&quot; was driven ashore in Eastern Passage on the opposite side of Halifax Harbour. Another harbour tour vessel, the tern schooner &quot;Silva,&quot; broke from her moorings and caused extensive damage to the Cable Wharf on the Halifax Waterfront. Dozens of smaller yachts were also driven ashore; extensive damage occurred to yacht clubs in the Bedford Basin and Northwest Arm. Dozens of containers were knocked off two container ships at the South End Container Terminal. Wharves on the Halifax and Dartmouth waterfront suffered large amounts of damage and several railcars were washed into the harbour at the Dartmouth railway yard; one of the tracks for the double-track main line was washed out in several places along the Bedford Basin near Millview. Coastal flooding was also reported around Halifax Harbour as a result of the storm surge, although inland flooding was minor as rainfall was not heavy due to Juan&#x27;s fast forward movement.

Less severe property damage was recorded west of the storm&#x27;s track into St. Margarets Bay and Mahone Bay. In addition to Halifax Regional Municipality&#x27;s urban core, the town of Truro and all of rural Colchester County as well as the western part of Pictou County experienced property damage and power outages from falling trees; numerous barns and other agricultural buildings were damaged east of the storm&#x27;s path, including a replica of the &quot;Hector&quot; in Pictou Harbour. The severity of property damage in the metropolitan areas of Halifax and Dartmouth of Halifax Regional Municipality initially led some forecasters to believe that Juan was likely a Category 3 hurricane; however, the sustained wind reports did not justify that suggestion. Many of the deciduous trees in central Nova Scotia still had leaves, which magnified the effects of wind damage. Overall, the number of damaged trees was estimated to be in the millions.

Juan claimed six lives (two directly) in Nova Scotia. Both of the direct deaths were due to fallen trees; one was a Halifax paramedic and the other was a motorist in Enfield. Three of the four indirect deaths were as a result of a house fire started by candles when electricity was cut, and the fourth was in relief work after the storm.

===Rest of Atlantic Canada===

The storm maintained Category 1 strength as it tracked across Nova Scotia and into the Northumberland Strait, weakening to a tropical storm as it emerged into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Wind gusts of were reported in Charlottetown and in the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

Damage was also reported in Prince Edward Island as a result of the storm, particularly around Charlottetown, where its waterfront sustained heavy wave damage to pleasure craft and sea walls, as well as significant damage to the older urban forest in that city&#x27;s downtown core. Extensive tree damage was also reported across the island, as well as structural damage to weaker buildings, such as barns and silos. The hurricane left portions of the island without power. The narrow path meant that damage was quite localized; little damage was reported in New Brunswick or western Prince Edward Island. Voting in the PEI general election on September 29 was also disrupted, though more than 80% of voters made it to polling stations.

Two deaths were reported in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence off the remote Anticosti Island in Quebec. They were fishermen from New Brunswick operating near Anticosti Island.

==Aftermath==
In the hours following the storm a state of emergency was declared in Halifax Regional Municipality and parts of neighbouring East Hants Municipal District and Colchester County. The Government of Nova Scotia requested that the federal government deploy 600 Canadian Forces personnel to assist local authorities in HRM with clean-up in the urban area and to assist utility crews with electrical power restoration. Many utility workers, especially those employed by Nova Scotia Power and the dozens of crews from Maritime Electric and NB Power who responded under mutual assistance agreements, worked intensively for almost three weeks. Nova Scotia power reported that they had restored power to the last of their affected customers by October 12, 2 weeks after the storm had passed.

The devastated Point Pleasant Park remained closed for clean-up after the storm before re-opening in June 2004, nine months after the storm hit, with a damaged shoreline and almost 85% of its trees removed. A revitalization and reforestation program began in 2005.

The Government of Nova Scotia pledged $10 million (2003 CAD) in relief money after the hurricane hit, and private contributions were also made quickly after the storm hit. Prince Edward Island also pledged $200,000 (2003 CAD) immediately after the hurricane hit, and the federal government also announced their own package. The Mayor of Toronto at the time, Mel Lastman, also contributed $50,000 (2003 CAD) to replace damaged trees in Prince Edward Island.

Hurricane Juan alerted residents, governments, utilities, and emergency management agencies throughout Atlantic Canada to improve preparations for devastating events such as hurricanes, especially with climatological data pointing to possible increased frequency of major ocean storms and extratropical cyclones. In addition to Juan, three other storms — Fabian, Isabel and Kate — had a significant effect on land or offshore in Canada during the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season.

Preparations and planning have been underway since 2003 and were first tested when Hurricane Ophelia was forecast to brush near Nova Scotia in early September 2005. Hurricane Juan has also resulted in several changes to the Meteorological Service of Canada&#x27;s Canadian Hurricane Centre, which has relocated from a vulnerable and exposed location in an office building in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, to a more secure location that can withstand hurricane damage. CHC&#x27;s hurricane warning system has also been improved; traditionally, CHC did not issue standard hurricane or tropical storm watches or warnings, just high wind and heavy rainfall warnings, which were often not heeded by local residents. Beginning in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season, CHC began using standard hurricane warnings for storms potentially affecting Canada.

Hurricane Juan lent its name to a severe blizzard that struck Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island a few months later in February 2004 which quickly became known as White Juan because the paralyzing effects of the massive snowfall evoked the recent hurricane.

===Retirement===
At the request of Environment Canada, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name &quot;Juan&quot; in the spring of 2004, and it will never again be used for a North Atlantic tropical cyclone. It was replaced with &quot;Joaquin&quot; for the 2009 season.

His father was a &quot;zamindar&quot;, and his grandfather served as the &quot;Aʻlā Ṣadr&quot; (district judge) under the Nawabs of Bengal.

In 1915, Amin passed the college entrance examination from Mymensingh Zilla School, joining Ananda Mohan College two years later to obtain his Intermediate in Arts (I.A); he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English literature in 1919. After graduating, Amin took a position teaching at the local school Gaffargaon Islamia Government High School and then another local school in Calcutta, but decided to pursue his career in law. In 1920, Amin began at the University of Calcutta; he gained an LLB in Law and Justice in 1924, and passed the Bar exam the same year. Amin started his career in law after joining the Mymensingh Judge Court Bar.

==Public service==

In 1929, Amin was appointed as a member of the Mymensingh Local Board, and later became a member of the Mymensingh District Board in 1930. In 1932, the British Indian Government appointed him as commissioner of Mymensingh Municipality. In 1937, Amin was appointed as the Chairman of Mymensingh District Board, an assignment he continued until 1945.

During this time, Amin&#x27;s interest in politics increased. He became an early member of the All-India Muslim League led by Mohammad Ali Jinnah. During this time, Amin was appointed as President of the Muslim League&#x27;s Mymensingh district unit. In 1944, he was elected vice-president of the Bengal Provincial Muslim League.

In 1945, Amin participated in the Indian general elections, securing a landslide victory. He became a Member, and the following year was elected as the Speaker General of the Bengal Legislative Assembly.

==Political role==

===Pakistan Movement===

Amin became a trusted lieutenant of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in East Bengal, fighting for the rights of Bengali Muslims in British India. Amin took an active part in the Pakistan Movement, organising Bengali Muslims, while he continued to strengthen the Muslim League in Bengal.

In 1946, Jinnah came to visit Bengal, where Amin assisted him. He promised the Bengali nation that, he would build a democratic country. In East Bengal, Amin promoted the unity of Muslims. By the time of the creation of Pakistan, Amin had become one of the leading advocates and activists of the Pakistan Movement; he had wide approval ratings by the Bengali population.

===Chief Minister===

After the death of Jinnah, Amin was nominated as the Chief Minister of East Bengal in September 1948 by Khawaja Nazimuddin, who succeeded Jinnah as Governor General.

Amin worked for the Muslim League in East Bengal, while continuing his relief programme for the population. As Chief Minister, his relations were significantly strained with Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan and the Governor-General of Pakistan Khawaja Nazimuddin. Soon after the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan, Amin was appointed as Minister of Supply. He was elected as a member of the Pakistan National Assembly from 1947 until 1954. Amin assumed the office of Chief Minister in a few weeks.

Historians have noted that Amin&#x27;s government was not strong enough to administer the provincial state; it was completely under the control of the central government of Nazimuddin. His government did not enjoy enough power, and lacked vision, imagination and initiatives. Amin failed to counter the Communist Party&#x27;s influence in the region, which widely took the credit for turning the language movement in 1952 into a large unified mass protest.

===Language Movement===

During Amin&#x27;s term as Chief Minister, Governor General Nazimuddin (also from East Bengal but bilingual) reiterated the federal government&#x27;s position that while Bengali was the language of virtually all East Pakistanis as well as the majority of Pakistanis as a whole, it was not to be considered a national language on a par with Urdu. In response, the Bengali Language Movement developed, and the ruling Muslim League lost popularity in East Pakistan. Both Nazimuddin and Amin failed to integrate the East Pakistani population with that of West Pakistan, and eventually the East Pakistan Muslim League lost significant administrative control of the province. Amin on the other hand, held Communist Party responsible for this failure, accusing them of provoking the language movement.

Public dissatisfaction with Amin had grown since October 1951, when Nazimuddin became prime minister. Amin expelled dissidents from within the ranks of the Muslim League, but doing so simply strengthened opposition to the party. In early 1952, students protested against Prime Minister Nazimuddin&#x27;s declaration in the provincial capital Dacca (now Dhaka) that Urdu would be the sole national language. During the unrest, the civilian East-Pakistan police opened fire, killing four student activists. This raised more opposition in the region to the Muslim League. Prime Minister Bogra (also a Bengali) visited East Bengal in early 1954 in an attempt to rally support for the League, but it was too late. Leading politicians in West and East Pakistan called for Amin&#x27;s resignation, and new elections were soon held.

===1954 elections===

In the 1954 provisional elections, the Muslim League was defeated by the United Front, an alliance between the Awami League (led by Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy), the Krishak Sramik Party (chaired by A. K. Fazlul Huq), the Nizam Islam Party (headed by Maulana Athar Ali), and the Ganatantri Dal (led by Haji Mohammad Danesh and Mahmud Ali), eventually becoming more and more influential in Pakistani politics. It was in this turnover that Amin lost his assembly seat to a veteran student leader of East Pakistan, Khaleque Nawaz Khan, who had also been active in the Language Movement. The Muslim League was effectively eliminated from the provincial political landscape.

Amin served as the president of the East Pakistan Muslim League, and worked to improve its standing. During this time, the Pakistani authorities made reforms, including granting official status to the Bengali language in 1956 alongside Urdu. But after Army Commander General Mohammad Ayub Khan imposed martial law following the successful October 1958 Pakistani coup d&#x27;état against the government of President Iskander Mirza, Amin&#x27;s political career was halted as Ayub Khan disbanded all political parties in the country.

===Leader of the opposition===

Amin ran as a candidate in the 1965 presidential elections in East Pakistan, winning the majority vote in the Parliament of Pakistan. He declined working with Ayub Khan. The same year, after the death of Fatima Jinnah, Amin succeeded Jinnah as Leader of the Opposition, which he held until 1969, after General Yahya Khan imposed martial law again.

Amin in June 1969 merged his National Democratic Front with a dissident group of the Awami League led by Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, the Nizam-e-Islam Party, and Air Marshal (Retd.) Asghar Khan&#x27;s Justice Party to form the Pakistan Democratic Party (PDP). The new party was ideologically moderate. It strongly supported a united Pakistan. Amin was elected president of the PDP at its first convention.

===1970 elections===

In the 1970 Pakistani general election, the PDP fielded 21 candidates in West Pakistan and 81 in East Pakistan. Of all of them, only Amin won his seat, NE-83-Mymensingh-VIII. He was one of only two non-Awami League candidates elected to the National Assembly that year from East Pakistan.

===Liberation War of 1971===

In March 1971, the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out. Amin, long dedicated to a united Pakistan, opposed the separatist movement in his home province of East Pakistan.

As an anti-war and principal Pakistan Movement activist, Amin is considered in Pakistan as a patriot who worked to retain Pakistan as a united nation, however he is considered by many Bangladeshis as a traitor who collaborated with an occupying force accused of genocide and other war crimes.

===Prime Ministership and Vice Presidency===

Yahya Khan appointed Amin Prime Minister on 6 December 1971. On 20 December 1971, however, Amin&#x27;s term as prime minister was cut short as Khan resigned, leaving the deputy prime minister (and foreign minister) Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to be sworn in as the new president. Two days later, Amin was appointed as Vice President of Pakistan, the only person to have held this post. He was sworn into the post again on 23 April 1972 after the interim constitution came into effect and martial law was lifted. He continued to hold the post until the office was abolished with the entry into force of the new constitution on 14 August 1973.

==Death and legacy==

Amin stayed in West Pakistan, while his home region achieved independence as the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh. He died of cardiac arrest aged 81 in Rawalpindi on 2 October 1974 and was given a public state funeral by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He was buried in Jinnah Mausoleum, next to Jinnah. His tomb was specially designed, made of Italian white marble, with golden letters for his name and contributions.

Amin had written an unpublished autobiography. His second-eldest son, Anwarul Amin Makhon, was the former general manager of BCCI Bangladesh and opened Bangladesh Bank&#x27;s first branch abroad (in London). Anwarul Amin Makhon was married to the Ekushey Padak-winning writer and poet Razia Khan, the daughter of Pakistan Assembly Speaker Tamizuddin Khan, and had two children: banker Kaiser Tamiz Amin and journalist Aasha Mehreen Amin.

<text>Juan José de Amézaga Landaroso (January 28, 1881 – August 21, 1956) was a Uruguayan political figure.

==Background==
Amézaga was a prominent member of the Colorado Party, which ruled the country for long periods. He was a lawyer by profession, and taught that subject at university level for many years. His political base was in Durazno, which he represented in the Chamber of Deputies between 1907 and 1915.

Amézaga graduated from the University of Montevideo in 1905 with a degree in Law and Social Sciences, and was granted a scholarship by the Law School that took him to France and Germany. After he returned to Montevideo he was appointed professor of penal law and later professor of civil law at the University. He filled the latter for 23 years while also teaching courses in philosophy and industrial legislation. In 1908 he was appointed to a committee to study and formulate a national public assistance law and later served as director of the National Labor Office. He was later named Minister of Industry in 1915, during which time he did much to stimulate and develop national industry. He later headed the National Postal Savings Bureau, and for a time served as chairman of the Export and Import Control Commission. He was also president of the Athenaeum of Montevideo, a member of the Secondary Education Council, the National Public Assistance Board, and the Board for the Protection of Minors, and was also honorary director of the Law School Library and a member of the Governing Board of the Casa de Estudios (House of Studies). Amézaga also represented Uruguay at international conferences; serving in 1923 as a Uruguayan representative at the League of Nations in Geneva, and was a delegate to the Fourth, Fifth Sixth, and Seventh International Conferences of American States.

In 1932, on the occasion of the interdict between Argentina and Uruguay, Amézaga was appointed Extraordinary Ambassador, &quot;crowning his mission with the most frank success.&quot; In addition to the aforementioned positions, by decree of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs he was appointed Delegate of Uruguay to the V. International Conference held in Santiago de Chile in 1923; Plenipotentiary Delegate to the Assembly of the Council of the League of Nations (IV. Session), by decree of the same Secretariat of State of July 6, 1928; Delegate of Uruguay to the VI and VII I-American Conferences, held in 1928 in Havana and in 1933 in Montevideo, respectively. Also, by decree of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs &quot;he was appointed Delegate of Uruguay to the V. International Conference held in Santiago de Chile in 1923; Plenipotentiary Delegate to the Assembly of the Council of the League of Nations (IV. Session), by decree of the same Secretariat of State of July 6, 1928; Delegate of Uruguay to the VI and VII I-American Conferences, held in 1928 in Havana and in 1933 in Montevideo, respectively.&quot; In addition, he taught Civil Law courses at the Faculty of Law and Social Sciences until February 1933, when he resigned from that position. 

Amézaga was involved in much legislation of a reformist nature, with one study noting that &quot;As a deputy, he intervened, either as an author, as an informant member or in the discussions, in all the laws that were sanctioned from 1908 to 1914. He was the author, among others, of the following projects: old-age pensions, work accidents, free salary of the married woman, and the reorganization of the National Public Assistance, in collaboration, this last project with an extra-parliamentary Commission.&quot; He was also close to José Batlle y Ordóñez, serving as a deputy both in Batlle&#x27;s second government and that of Claudio Williman. He later served as president of the State Insurance Bank from 1917 to 1933, resigning due to Gabriel Terra&#x27;s coup.

Amézaga also played an important role in drafting a new constitution, when the question of constitutional reform was raised in Uruguay in 1942. Noting his contribution to this, Amézaga proclaimed in a 1943 speech that 

&quot;I have actively collaborated in the preparation of the new constitutional texts that are beginning to govern us. I have confidence in them, as does the people who approved them with an overwhelming majority, considering them to be a faithful expression of the aspirations for justice and a sure guarantee of political freedom and individual rights. Time will rectify and perfect our work. The law is realized in stages, it is the fruit of a continuous and tireless struggle that in past times prohibited men from doing harm to their fellow men, which then forced them to give each one what legitimately belonged to him, and which in our time claims as a legal obligation what before was only advised as charity.&quot;

==President of Uruguay==
===Main features===
He was President of Uruguay from 1943 to 1947. His rule is seen as significantly the first wholly constitutional presidency since the coup d&#x27;état carried out by Gabriel Terra in 1933.

Amézaga&#x27;s vice president was Alberto Guani, who had already distinguished himself as a veteran diplomat. The veteran Socialist leader Emilio Frugoni was sent to Moscow by President Amézaga, as Uruguayan Ambassador.

Amézaga, along with the reform currents he represented, won a large majority in the 1942 Uruguayan general election. His election, according to one journal, “completed the democratic restoration and the definitive burial of &quot;Marzismo&quot;, the regime that emerged around Gabriel Terra.” According to one study, Amézaga took office in 1943 “with the challenge of running a transitional administration, suitable to conduct the country out of the authoritarian impasse and navigating the last years of the world war.” Another study has argued that his presidency “represented in general a tranquillizing interval , threatening no expectations , endangering no established interest.” His presidency was given the task of overseeing Uruguay&#x27;s political transition and implementing a new constitution. To accomplish this Amézaga surrounded himself with ministers with political experience. He also formed his cabinet based on the part factions according to the results of the presidential election. Batllism gained the greatest cabinet representation with 7 ministers, followed by “Para servir al Pais” with 5 and “Libertad y Justicia” with 4. 

According to one study, Amézaga began “with what has been characterized as a weak administration, so weak that only with great difficulty was it able to secure the adoption of his most important legislation.” Amézaga was hampered internally by the Blanco Party’s Nazi-influenced Herrerista wing and externally by intense Argentine political and economic pressure, and survived “due in no small part to U.S. Lend-Lease assistance and Export-Import Bank Loans.” He also survived a right-wing plot against the government in July 1946. 

A year earlier, in June 1945 the episode of the so-called &quot;implications&quot; occurred which, as summarised by one study, “exposed the way, in which the traditional political cast acted in the management of public administration. Many public men were accused of taking advantage of their positions to obtain &quot;extra&quot; benefits from their commercial and industrial activities through the exchange control. The denunciation was presented by the Herrerismo, trying to sharpen the differences between the colorados, and at the same time to stop his economic policy, which did not satisfy the cattle breeders. The issue provoked a temporary ministerial crisis, which was remedied with a new distribution of the cabinet: two ministries for men of confidence of the president, three for batllismo, two for blancocevedismo and two for independent nationalism. Finally, in December 1945, a resolution was passed in Parliament declaring that there had been no &quot;illicit exercise of public office&quot;. The case was thus closed.”

===Social reforms===
In spite of the difficulties Amézaga&#x27;s government faced, his presidency was nevertheless notable for the passage of a wide range of reform measures. During his first year as president laws were passed establishing a social assistance fund to provide food for the unemployed and for pre-school and schoolchildren throughout the country, amending the law regulating home industries, organizing departmental labor distribution commissions, providing for aid to the unemployed via investment in extraordinary public works, regulating working conditions in the lumber industry, fixing minimum wages and working conditions in the construction industry, lowering rents for workers’ homes, and regulating working hours. Education budgets were also raised for normal and secondary schools, and measures adopted to help farmers affected by an unprecedented drought. This included creating arbitration and conciliation boards to solve the problem of farm rents, regulating the marketing of wheat, and providing for the acquisition of seed oats. There was also reform in the Ministry of Public Health, &quot;all directed toward improvement in administration, more exacting standards for specialized positions, and an increase in health activities, especially in the interior of the country.&quot;

Act No. 10,489 of 6 June 1944 &quot;modified the standards for hours and rest periods for commercial establishments of a certain type which can interrupt their activities without inconvenience to the public.&quot; The Act also fixes &quot;opening and closing hours for such establishments and provides that they may be open to the public from five minutes after their opening until ten minutes before their closing time ; the staff may be required to work continuously, subject to the observance of specified rest periods.&quot; Additionally, the Act &quot;forbids the working of more than eight hours on five days of the week and four hours on the sixth. The protection afforded by the Act is extended to the staff of such workshops as commercial establishments may possess on their own premises for the manufacture or finishing of goods for direct retail sale to the public. Such staff must be regarded as commercial employees and not as workers in industry.&quot; 

Act No. 10,421 of 16 April 1943 regulates the hours of work for banks and similar institutions, dividing the year into two periods, &quot;one running from 1 April to 15 December, and the other from 16 December to 31 March, and entrusts to a tripartite board the fixing of the hours during which these establishments, whether public or private, may be open to the public in winter and in summer respectively.&quot; Under the Act the ordinary working day &quot;is limited to six and a quarter hours daily, with a fifteen-minute break granted between the fourth and fifth hours. The staff may be required to work up to forty-five additional hours in the quarter, outside this ordinary working day, provided that no employee is requested to do so more than twenty-one times per quarter, for not less than two hours at a time. This last provision is intended to prevent the additional hours from being used in a, manner contrary to the spirit of the law, for example, by spreading them at the rate of forty-five minutes per day, which would extend the working day to seven hours.&quot; Special procedures for dealing with grievances over unjustified layoffs in the state were also set up during his presidency.

Act No. 10,684 of 17 December 1945 established the right to 12 days of paid annual holiday &quot;for all persons in the employment of private individuals or undertakings who have completed twelve months, twenty-four fortnights or fifty-two weeks of work, whether or not the employment has been continuous, and whether it has been with one or several employers ; the right to the holiday depends solely on the time worked.&quot; Earlier measures, the first of which was adopted in 1933, had provided for an annual holiday in various branches of activity, fixed at twelve working days after one year&#x27;s continuous service; but they dealt separately with salaried employees paid by the month and wage earners paid by the day. The Act also provided that &quot;on 1 January, 1 May and 25 August (the national holiday) of each year all wage earners shall be paid as though they had worked on these days ; if they were in fact employed on any of these days, they mast receive double pay. The annual holiday thus in practice amounts to fifteen days.&quot; Act No. 10,471 of 3 March 1944 extends to workers &quot;employed in the exploitation of forests, mountains and peateries the benefits of the laws on hours of work, weekly rest, wage councils and family allowances, and moreover establishes compulsory insurance against industrial accidents and occupational diseases, giving the Government and the State Insurance Bank the power to prohibit work, by force, if need be, when this obligation has not been met.&quot; 

Act No. 10,449 of 12 November 1943 &quot;defines the minimum wage, sets up a system of wage councils for its fixation and provides for family allowances. It protects wage earners and salaried employees in industry, commerce, private offices and the offices of public services not run by the State. The first part of the Act (sections 1-4) defines what is meant by the minimum wage, determines how it is to be calculated for piece work, specifies that payment shall be made in currency and prohibits the truck system. It makes employers responsible for the actions of agents and subcontractors in their service. The National Institute of Labour and Belated Services is empowered to represent the workers in making direct or indirect claims for the payment of wages due.&quot; This part of the Act &quot;fixes the various penalties that may be inflicted upon those who infringe it and the procedure to be followed for the recovery of fines. The second part of the Act (sections 5-20 and 28-30) contained notes &quot;for the setting up of wage councils to determine minimum wage rates for workers protected by the Act, whose activities are grouped for purposes of simplified administration.&quot; The third part of the Act &quot;introduced a compulsory-system of equalisation funds for the payment of family allowances to all wage earners and salaried employees in respect of each legitimate or illegitimate, legally recognised or legally registered child. Allowances are paid in respect of children up to fourteen years of age, or up to sixteen if they attend a secondary school or preparatory studies or are undergoing apprenticeship at special centres. The allowance is paid to the worker, who is responsible for its administration. Together with his wages, and those of his wife if she also works, it may not exceed 200 pesos. When one of the children is the breadwinner, he receives the allowance, his brothers and sisters being treated as his children for this purpose; a similar rule applies with regard to an employed person, of either sex, who is the sole support, permanently and in a manner duly proved, of one or more orphans or deserted children.&quot;

Act No. 10,489 of 6 June 1944 and its counterpart No. 10,542 of 20 October 1944, &quot;provides that all wage earners and salaried employees in commerce, private services, public services run by private individuals, and industry who do not work at piece rates, or for daily or hourly wages, shall have the right, when dismissed, to a compensation equivalent to their total monthly remuneration (including wages, percentages, commissions on sales, gratuities) in respect of each year of service or fraction of a year, up to three months&#x27; pay if they are pensionable, and six months&#x27; pay if not. This compensation cannot be combined with that provided by Article 158 of the Commercial Code, but does not affect that due under section 26 of Act &#x27;No. 9196.&quot; In October 1946 an Agricultural Workers’ Code was enacted &quot;to provide general coverage to rural workers on such matters as wages, housing, weekly rest and annual holidays, unfair dismissal, etc.&quot; Also, according to the law that provided for the establishment of this code, “The rural worker, in all trials that are processed related to compliance with this law, will enjoy the benefit of poverty relief.” 

Act No. 10,570 of 15 December 1944 regulated &quot;the system of dismissal compensation for workers on piece rates or on daily or hourly wages and permanently employed in industry, who had been excepted from the general law. The compensation amounts to twenty-five days&#x27; pay for each year during which the worker has worked 240 days, subject to a maximum of three or six months&#x27; pay, depending on whether or not he is pensionable. Workers who have worked in the same establishment for less than 240 days but more than 100 days are entitled to two days&#x27; compensation for every twenty-five days of work. Here also, misconduct deprives the worker of his right to compensation.&quot; Workers in the meat packing industry who are members of its Unemployment Fund were subject to a special régime under Act No. 10,713 of 15 March 1946. If the Board of the Fund &quot;considers the dismissal unfair, the worker may choose between compensation and the benefits paid by the Fund. Compensation is composed of two parts: one part is paid to the worker and is equal to two working days&#x27; pay for every twenty-five days or every month of permanent employment at the disposal of the Fund, up to a total of 75 or 150 working days&#x27; pay, according as he is entitled to pension or not ; the other consists of the aggregate of the specified indemnities which the undertaking must pay to the Fund as fixed by the Board.&quot;

To combat unemployment in the meat packing industry, the largest industry in Uruguay, Act No. 10,562 of 21 December 1944 established an Unemployment Fund and provided for the organisation of employment exchanges for the members of the Fund. The system of benefits established by the Act &quot;guarantees a minimum of 100 hours of work per month per worker ; if a worker is employed for less than this minimum, the Fund pays him benefit in respect of the hours not worked, in accordance with a special schedule. Workers protected by this Act cannot refuse without just cause to give their services when the establishment so requires, whether in their ordinary occupation or in any other activity.&quot; Under Act No. 10,681 of 10 December 1945, a similar scheme to that for the meat packing industry &quot;was introduced for workers in wool, leather, etc., depots and warehouses, whose activity extends over only a few months of the year, since their work depends on the harvest and is seasonal in character.&quot; The rights of women were also advanced as a result of Law 10,783 of 1946, known as the Law of Civil Rights of Women. This abolished the legal incapacity of married women, while also equalizing the rights of fathers and mothers with respect to their minor children. 

A Decree concerning demolition dated 14 September 1945 &quot;amends Section 70 of the accident prevention regulations of 22 January 1936. Before undertaking any excavation or demolition bordering on the public highway, permission must be obtained from the Directorate of Municipal Works. Neighbouring walls must be adequately shored, and precautions must be taken to prevent heavy falls of material from damaging adjacent buildings. Specified precautions must also be taken when lowering demolition material on to the public highway. As a general rule, buildings must be demolished storey by storey, beginning at the top. When necessary for the safety of the workers, platforms and scaffolds must be used. If other means of protection are not practicable, safety belts must be worn.&quot; A Decree respecting dough brakes dated 14 September 1945 &quot;amends Section 19 of the accident prevention regulations of 22 January 1936. It fixes the position of the rolls in the machine, requires the lower roll to be fenced, and provides for the installation of a handwheel for separating the rolls, of hand and foot brakes, and of protection for gearing, belts and pulleys.&quot; A Decree prohibiting the employment of persons whose infirmities predispose them to accidents, dated 14 September 1945, &quot;amends Section 11 of the accident prevent regulations of 22 January 1936, by adding a subsection 13 which prohibits the employment in any occupation of workers who are clearly not in a normal physical or mental condition.&quot;

Law 10487 of May 1944 provided for the amount of the Public Works Debt 5% of 1942 to be increased by eight million pesos, with the increase in issuance that is authorized being allocated to various hospital works. Law 10,809 of October the 16th 1946 provided for discharged rural workers over the age of 70 (or over 55 if female) to receive a monthly advance of up to 70% of the minimum retirement pension from the Social Insurance Bank, with money for this purpose to be provided by the employer beforehand. In addition, discharged rural workers had to be helped by the employer to move themselves, their families and their household effects, and if “the rural worker, or any member of his family, is sick, he is allowed to stay on the farm or establishment as long as necessary in order to avoid a risk to his health.” Law 10497 of June 1944 authorized the Executive Power “to acquire directly from the farmers and in the manner provided for in subparagraph E) of article 2, the amounts it deems necessary of corn from the present crop to the in order to avoid a drop in prices, maintaining a minimum price level that contemplates the interests of producers and consumers.” 

Under Law 10495 of June 1944, “The workers and employees of businesses and annexes not included in decree-law number 9,347, of April 13, 1934, will enjoy the benefits and guarantees established in articles 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the law of June 1944. 

Under Law 10530 of September 1944 “The old-age pension benefit, established in article 1 of law number 6,874 of February 11, 1919 and number 7,880 of August 13, 1925, can be requested upon reaching 59 years of age, and will be settled without prejudice to the resolution final decision issued by the Institute from the date on which the interested party reaches the age of 60, provided that it has not been previously denied by verification, at the Institute&#x27;s expense, of the petitioner&#x27;s lack of rights.” 

Law 10511 of August 1944 authorized the Executive Power “to dispose of up to the amount of ten million pesos for the construction of buildings for the operation of urban and rural schools.” Law 10526 of September 1944 authorized the Executive Power “to allocate the equivalent of up to one hundred thousand dollars ($/a 100,000.00) as a contribution from the Ministry of Public Health to the &quot;Pan American Cooperative Public Health Service&quot;, in accordance with the agreements entered into with the Office of the Coordinator of American Affairs.” These funds, as well as five hundred thousand dollars donated by the United States of North America, were be used “in the preparation and beginning of execution of a Public Hygiene and Health plan in Uruguay, and its investment will be authorized, in each case, by the Ministry of Public Health.” 

Law 10610 of April 1945 authorized the Executive Branch “to issue up to the sum of two million pesos ($2,000,000.00) in titles called &quot;National Bonds for the Sanitation of Inland Cities&quot; payable in twenty years, with an interest of five percent (5%) annual, payable quarterly in arrears.” The proceeds from the sale of these Bonds would be used exclusively “to pay for internal sanitation works, connections with public sewers and external running water pipes, for constructions located in cities or towns in the interior, when the value of each construction does not exceed five thousand pesos ($5,000.00) according to the capacity for the payment of the real estate contribution or according to the building permit and provided that it is the only property of the interested owner; or that, in the case of having more than one, the set value does not exceed that limit.” Under Law 10838 of October 1946, the Honorary Commission for the Fight against Tuberculosis (which was previously established by law of January 17, 1946) “is hereby authorized to use up to 3% of its annual resources for the hiring of inspection personnel and Social Visitors.” 

Under Law 10565 of December 1944, “Are included in the benefits granted by decree-law number 10,256 of October 21, 1942, retirees and their successors whose passivity has been granted prior to said decree-law -in their capacity as Teachers of the Deaf-Mute and mentally abnormal of the State schools - being able consequently to reform the respective certificates.” In addition, “The Teachers of the General Artigas National Institute for the Blind, as well as those already retired or their successors in title, will enjoy the benefits established in the previous article and in Law number 9,878 on retirement of private school teachers.” Law No. 10,694 of 1945 “increases the capital of the Rural Development and Colonization Section of the BHU, establishing regulations and creating special resources.” 

In a speech he made in 1946, Amézaga listed various laws that had been introduced, amended and passed. Amongst others, these included laws concerning employment offices for maritime workers, increased pay for pieceworkers, and reduced rents on rural land where there was hoof and mouth disease. In addition, various measures were adopted concerning public works and other subjects including a public health program, lowcost housing in Montevideo and Artigas, creation of a School of Library Science, establishment of a School of Liberal Arts and of an oceanographic and fishing service, and improvement of sanitation. According to a presidential decree approved on 28 January 1944, laborers on public works projects “are henceforth to have the benefit of adequate and sanitary housing facilities whenever the construction projects on which they are working are located more than a mile and a quarter from the nearest town or city limits,” A Permanent National Fund was set up to assist in the fight against tuberculosis, which was exclusively aimed at providing social assistance pensions to the families of tubercular patients. In addition, an Honorary Commission was established “to function within the Ministry of Public Health, charged with studying, planning, and advising the Government on measures to combat the disease, organizing and directing a permanent census of tuberculosis sufferers in the country, preparing and disseminating campaign propaganda, and administering the Fund.” In August 1944 10,000,000 pesos were authorized by the government for city and rural school building throughout Uruguay. 

===International affairs===
Amézaga&#x27;s time in office saw a growing coolness towards Argentina (which changed following the overthrow of Juan Perón) and a closer association with the United States which, according to one study, “had been a traditional Colorado counterweight to British influence but was now more a function of the economic, political and military dominance of the United States in the region and Uruguay&#x27;s briefly held ambition to take a prominent role in the inter-American system.” Government support was given for multi-lateral agreements on hemispheric defence sponsored by the United States in 1945 and at Rio de Janeiro in 1947. In 1946 commercial agreements were made with Belgium and France, a treaty of friendship was concluded with Russia, and new agreements regarding trade and payments were made with Great Britain. 

Amézaga also spoke out against the horrors of the Second World War, stating in 1943 that

&quot;The current war represents one of the cruelest and bloodiest stages in the history of humanity in the fight for rights. Free men offer lives and assets to ward off the danger of the most atrocious and iniquitous of slavery. We are part of the rearguard of the immense army of humanity that defends itself in a fight of life or death for civilization and it is natural that we must stoically endure the sacrifices that common defense demands. Let us seek to achieve international peace by destroying those who violate the law at their roots, and let us not forget within our homeland that humanity cannot live in a society founded on injustice. Only through hypocrisy or timidity could we conceal the serious legal and moral deficiencies that affect the organization of contemporary democracies. It is not about dispossessing anyone, nor imposing solutions through violence, because the iniquities of dispossession, nor the arbitrariness, have never served to found anything solid. Let us contribute our help in the fight for the right that obliges us to help men and nations that need help. Let us do work of restorative and distributive justice. The horrors of external war have not reached our heads. Nobody thinks about civil wars or social demands through force.&quot;

Towards the end of the war, Amézaga led Uruguay (which had previously broken with the Axis in 1942) to declare war on the Axis powers on February the 21st 1945.

Amézaga&#x27;s foreign minister Eduardo Rodriguez Larreta advocated “multilateral intervention” in the Americas as a way of preventing individual countries “from rejecting democratic institutions and jeopardizing hemispheric security.” In November 1945 Rodriquez sent a note to the other American governments. His proposal, referred to sometimes erroneously in English as the “Larreta” Doctrine, appealed for collective action to promote human rights and democracy and oppose dictators. While the plan was directed implicitly against Argentina, it was aimed broadly at general inter-American relations. In part of his note, Rodriguez asserted that “the purest respect for the principle of non-intervention of one State in the affairs of another (…) does not protect unlimitedly the notorious and repeated violation by any republic of elementary rights of man (…) In the international politics of America, the parallelism between peace and democracy should constitute an indeclinable norm of action.” His proposal was, however, rejected overwhelming by the American governments “on the grounds that such a course would be equivalent to authorizing unacceptable collective intervention,” therefore setting in, as noted by one study, “what they deemed its proper place the attempts at creating some sort of international supervision of the observance of human rights at a domestic level.”

===Economic policies===
During Amézaga&#x27;s presidency, struggles between the different dominant factions and their respective country projects continued, but the crises that caused these contradictions were resolved in a less traumatic way. As noted by one study “This was fundamentally due to the favorable economic conditions created by the war, which allowed a greater margin of understanding. The increase in profits in the livestock sector, coming from a greater demand for meat and wool paid at better prices, generated in said sector, a more critical and more &quot;understanding&quot; attitude towards the industrialization policy promoted by the government.” The government took advantage of favorable international conditions created by the war, with Uruguay able to once again sell its products to the fighting nations of the United States and Europe, while control over exchange rates, exports and imports resulted in improved living standards for the popular sectors, increased importance of the industrial sector, and a sound trade balance. New mechanisms were established to restore the states role as arbiter in conflicts between employers and workers. Sectors of the labor force approved these measures, particularly the communists. A tax on all profits over 12% a year was also introduced, while public works were promoted. On 20 December 1944 the Uruguyan Congress approved a law authorizing the issuance of bonds to finance a 5-year public works program, with proceeds used for projects like reforestation and soil erosion control. The encouragement of public works enabled the government to significantly reduce unemployment, while also increasing the popularity of the public works minister Tomás Berreta, who would later succeed Amézaga as president. Berreta also attended particularly to, as noted by one study, &quot;the interests of small agricultural producers in Canelones, a sector in which his political influence was considerable.&quot; Also significantly, starting in 1945 “the government promoted a policy of subsidies and credits for industry, which will boost production. Towards the end of the Amézaga government, the prospects for accelerated industrial development were clearly drawn on the country&#x27;s economic horizon.”

Various measures were also adopted to reduce the cost of living. During Amézaga&#x27;s first year in office there were &quot;a great number of price-fixing and other regulatory measures, adopted to control the cost of living and the supply and distribution of articles of prime necessity.&quot; In 1945, the government contributed money towards lower consumer prices for articles of prime necessity such as meat, potatoes, bran, oats, corn, and wheat, while money was also contributed towards supporting popular dining rooms in the capital and provinces, and for winter social assistance and social security. 

As noted by one study, Amézaga&#x27;s presidency &quot;took place in the midst of the favorable effects of the World War on the revitalization ofour exports. However, when it comes to industrial production, although the development process continued, it is recorded in these years a slowing down of its previous pace. Two factors seem to have influenced for this to occur: on the one hand, the difficulties in importing inputs caused by the war, and on the other, the regressive form of income distribution that had existed led to reducing domestic demand. It is in that direction then, that sectors of the industrial bourgeoisie fundamentally linked to the internal market, will play their card in favor of a change in redistributive policy through the unfreezing of social security policy and labor legislation with respect to the salaried sectors, with a view to strengthening the market and thus boosting industrial development and its profits.&quot;

===1947===
The year 1947 opened with Amézaga, younger by several years than his successor, preparing to step down as President in favour of his elected successor, Tomás Berreta, who was already aged in his 70s. Berreta&#x27;s Presidency was to last barely 5 months, since he was to die in office.

==Literary works==

In addition to his activities as a politician, Amézaga was the author of various published works on penal and civil law, one of which, De las Nulidades en General (On Nullities in General), won a prize offered by the Law School of his alma mater. Additionally, he wrote numerous articles for periodicals that dealt with labor, social welfare, and legal topics.

Among the works that Amézaga gave to publicity included “On teaching Criminal Law at the University of Montevideo. Explanation of reasons for a program of this subject. Prologue by Dr. Carlos M. de Pena” (1908), 1 foll. 41 pp; “Of nullities in general. (Thesis rated unanimously outstanding). Prologue by Dr. José A. de Freitas” (1909), 1 vol. from VII-262 pp. ; “Aquilian guilt. Lessons from the Civil Law course” (1914), 1 vol. of 327 pp.; “Shorthand notes from the second course of Civil Law (1929), 2 vols. of 123 pp. and&#x27; 123 pp. and 126 pp. 

Amézaga also published the following works in the “Journal of Law and Social Sciences”: “The simulation”, Volume I, Page 387; “Is the seizure of the debtor&#x27;s rights and actions legal, decreed generically, when, having hidden his assets, an individualized seizure becomes impossible?” Volume 2, Page 12; Can the State modify, through an interpretive law, the clauses of a concession contract-law?, Idn., Pages. 225; “Insurance and legal measures for protection and safety against work accidents”, Volume 3, Page 438. In addition, the following works were published by the “Journal of Law, Jurisprudence and Administration”: “Project on the protection of minors” (In collaboration with Drs. G. Terra and E. J. Lagarmilla), Volume 11, Pages. 23 7 and following; “On obligations”, Volume 27, Page 425; “Contracts in which the wife and husband are bound together” (In collaboration with Dr. J. Irureta Goyena), Volume 32, Page 29 7; “Guidelines for the reform of the Uruguayan Civil Code”, Volume 32, Pages. 388 et seq. 

==Post-presidency==
Following the end of his presidency, Amézaga retired from politics. He died after a long illness in Montevideo on August the 20th 1956, aged 75.

<doc id="555478" wikidata="Q949984" url="?curid=555478" title="Texas v. Johnson">
<text>Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), is a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held, 5–4, that burning the Flag of the United States was protected speech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as doing so counts as symbolic speech and political speech.

In the case, activist Gregory Lee Johnson was convicted for burning an American flag during a protest outside the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas, and was fined $2,000 and sentenced to one year in jail in accordance with Texas law. Justice William Brennan wrote for the five-justice majority that Johnson&#x27;s flag burning was protected under the freedom of speech, and therefore the state could not censor Johnson nor punish him for his actions.

The ruling invalidated prohibitions on desecrating the American flag, which at the time were enforced in 48 of the 50 states. The ruling was unpopular with the general public and lawmakers, with President George H. W. Bush calling flag burning &quot;dead wrong&quot;. The ruling was challenged by Congress, which passed the Flag Protection Act later that year, making flag desecration a federal crime. The law&#x27;s constitutionality was contested before the Supreme Court, which again affirmed in &quot;United States v. Eichman&quot; (1990) that flag burning was a protected form of free speech and struck down the Flag Protection Act as violating the First Amendment. In the years following the ruling, Congress several times considered the Flag Desecration Amendment, which would have amended the Constitution to make flag burning illegal, but never passed it. The issue of flag burning remained controversial decades later, and it is still used as a form of protest.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine described it as one of the best Supreme Court decisions since 1960, with legal scholars since stating about it that &quot;Freedom of speech applies to symbolic expression, such as displaying flags, burning flags, wearing armbands, burning crosses, and the like.&quot;

==Background==

On August 22, 1984, Gregory Lee Johnson, then a member of the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade, participated in a political demonstration during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, protesting the policies of the Reagan administration. The protestors marched through the streets, chanting political slogans and staging &quot;die-ins&quot; at several corporate buildings to dramatize the effects of nuclear war. Several protestors occasionally stopped to spray-paint walls and knock over potted plants, although Johnson himself took no part in it. At the Mercantile Bank Building, protestors removed the American flag from the flagpole outside. An unknown protestor handed the flag to Johnson, who hid it under his shirt.

When the protestors reached Dallas City Hall, Johnson poured kerosene on the flag and set it on fire. During the burning of the flag, protestors shouted phrases such as, &quot;America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on you, you stand for plunder, you will go under.&quot; No one was injured during the demonstration, though some witnesses to the flag burning felt deeply offended. Johnson was arrested within a half-hour of igniting the flag. One spectator, a Korean War veteran named Daniel Walker, gathered the remains of the flags and buried them in the backyard of his home in Fort Worth.

Johnson was charged with violating the Texas flag desecration statute, which prohibited the vandalism of respected or venerated objects. Johnson was the only individual at the protest to be criminally charged. He was initially indicted on one count of disorderly conduct, but the charge was eventually dropped. On December 13, 1984, a six-person jury found Johnson guilty of flag desecration, and he was subsequently sentenced to one year in jail and fined $2,000. Johnson appealed his conviction to the Fifth Court of Appeals of Texas, but was again found criminally liable. He then appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which overruled his conviction, finding that Johnson&#x27;s First Amendment rights had been violated. The court found that Johnson&#x27;s actions were symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment, writing that, &quot;a government cannot mandate by fiat a feeling of unity in its citizens. Therefore that very same government cannot carve out a symbol of unity and prescribe a set of approved messages to be associated with that symbol.&quot; The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also affirmed that his actions did not constitute a breach of the peace.

Texas filed a writ of &quot;certiorari&quot; to the Supreme Court, asking them to review the case. In 1988, the Supreme Court granted &quot;certiorari&quot;.

== Opinion of the Court ==

Oral arguments were held on March 21, 1989. David D. Cole and William Kunstler argued the case on behalf of Gregory Lee Johnson, and Kathi Alyce Drew argued on behalf of the state of Texas. During oral arguments, the state defended its statute on two grounds: first, states had a compelling interest in preserving a venerated national symbol; and second, the state had a compelling interest in preventing breaches of peace. The Supreme Court handed down a 5–4 opinion on June 21, 1989, in favor of Johnson. Justice William Brennan authored a majority opinion which Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony Kennedy joined. Kennedy also authored a separate concurring opinion.

In the majority opinion, Brennan reiterated the Court&#x27;s long-held recognition that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects non-speech acts as being symbolic speech, writing that the First Amendment&#x27;s protection on speech &quot;does not end at the spoken or written word&quot;. The Court recognized flags as being vessels for symbolic speech in &quot;Stromberg v. California&quot; (1931), in which the Court overruled the conviction of a youth camp worker who displayed a red flag at the camp. Brennan also invoked &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot; (1969), in which the Court recognized the wearing of a black armband as a form of speech, to demonstrate the Court&#x27;s history of recognizing symbolic actions as protected speech. The Court would then analyze whether Johnson&#x27;s actions could be considered symbolic speech, which would allow him to challenge his conviction by invoking the First Amendment.

In &quot;Spence v. Washington&quot; (1974), the Court rejected &quot;the view that an apparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled &#x27;speech&#x27; whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea&quot;, but acknowledged that conduct may be &quot;sufficiently imbued with elements of communication to fall within the scope of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.&quot; To determine whether a particular act possesses the elements of &quot;speech&quot; required to invoke the First Amendment, the Court asked whether &quot;an intent to convey a particularized message was present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by those who viewed it.&quot; The Court found, based on &quot;Spence&quot;, that Johnson&#x27;s burning of the flag &quot;constituted expressive conduct, permitting him to invoke the First Amendment.&quot; Brennan wrote that the political nature of the flag burning was &quot;both intentional and overwhelmingly apparent&quot;, having coincided with the Republican National Convention.

The Court rejected that Johnson was liable for a breach of the peace, writing that, &quot;no disturbance of the peace actually occurred or threatened to occur because Johnson burned the flag.&quot; While the state of Texas argued that flag burning is punishable on the basis that it &quot;tends to incite&quot; breaches of the peace, the Court disagreed, finding that flag burning does not necessarily lead to breaches of the peace. Citing &quot;Brandenburg v. Ohio&quot; (1969), Brennan wrote that the state may only punish speech that would incite &quot;imminent lawless action&quot;, and rejected that flag burning constituted such.

=== Kennedy&#x27;s concurrence ===
Justice Kennedy filed a concurring opinion with Brennan&#x27;s majority. In it, Kennedy acknowledged the potentially unpopular nature of the holding, but affirmed that the role of the Supreme Court is to uphold the integrity of the Constitution, even if &quot;sometimes we must make decisions we do not like.&quot; Kennedy continued:

=== Rehnquist&#x27;s dissent ===
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Byron White and Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor. Rehnquist argued that the &quot;unique position&quot; of the flag &quot;justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning in the way respondent Johnson did here.&quot; Rehnquist discussed the significance of the flag as applied throughout American history, such as during the colonial era, the War of 1812, and the Civil War, writing that burning a symbol of national unification was distinctly separate from other political demonstrations where freedom of speech might protect protestors. Rehnquist wrote:

Rehnquist argued that the flag held a unique position in American tradition, such as on the gravesites of Armed Forces members, and as such should be held in a unique position in First Amendment case law. Rehnquist invoked several previous rulings by the Court that showed a recognition of the flag as a unique national symbol, including &quot;Halter v. Nebraska&quot; (1907). Rehnquist quoted Justice John Marshall Harlan&#x27;s majority opinion in writing: &quot;For that flag every true American has not simply an appreciation, but a deep affection.&quot; However, the &quot;Johnson&quot; majority found a lack of evidence in the Constitution that implied that the flag should be held in a position of &quot;uniqueness&quot;. Brennan answered this claim directly in writing: &quot;There is, moreover, no indication—either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it—that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone&quot;, concluding that &quot;we decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment.&quot;

Rehnquist further argued that Johnson&#x27;s burning of the flag did not constitute expressive conduct, writing that flag burning is &quot;no essential part of any exposition of ideas&quot;, but rather &quot;the equivalent of an inarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely to be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize others&quot;. He opined that the Texas statute was a reasonable restriction only on how Johnson&#x27;s idea was expressed, leaving Johnson with &quot;a full panoply of other symbols and every conceivable form of verbal expression to express his deep disapproval of national policy&quot;.

=== Stevens&#x27;s dissent ===
Justice John Paul Stevens also wrote a dissenting opinion. Stevens argued for the cultural importance of the flag and all that it stands for, more broadly than just as a symbol of national unity. He wrote of the flag:

Stevens compared public desecration of the flag to posting bulletin boards on the Washington Monument, writing that such behavior &quot;might enlarge the market for free expression, but at a cost I would not pay&quot;. He asserted that Johnson was not punished for his opinion but rather for the way he chose to express it.

==Subsequent developments==
=== Public reaction ===
The ruling was unpopular among Americans and drew overwhelming criticism from the public. Legal scholar Geoffrey R. Stone remarked that the ruling was &quot;wildly unpopular&quot; with the American people, and &quot;Newsweek&quot; described a sense of &quot;stunned outrage&quot; across the country. In a nationwide public opinion poll taken shortly after the ruling, 75 percent of respondents disagreed with the decision, and nearly two-thirds supported the idea of a constitutional amendment to protect the flag. Polls taken by the National Opinion Research Center showed a decline in respondents expressing &quot;a great deal of confidence&quot; in the Court, dropping from 34 percent before the ruling, to 17 percent after. However, confidence levels might have been influenced by the Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot; two weeks after &quot;Johnson&quot;.

At a rally to raise support for the Flag Desecration Amendment, Senator Bob Dole () said: &quot;Americans may not know every nuance of Constitutional law. But they knew desecration when they see it. They&#x27;re demanding action.&quot; In a statement to the Senate on July 18, 1989, Senator Strom Thurmond () said that the ruling &quot;opened an emotional hydrant across our country demanding immediate action&quot;. On October 4, 1989, Senator Trent Lott () told the Senate that, while visiting constituents in Mississippi, he &quot;heard outrage&quot; in &quot;city after city&quot;, and claimed that several people he witnessed were &quot;in tears over the decision&quot;.

While initial support for the Flag Desecration Amendment was high among Americans, with a &quot;Newsweek&quot; poll indicating 71 percent of Americans agreed with such an idea, public support for the amendment waned by the following month. By late July, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell () reported his constituents were &quot;equally divided&quot; between those who supported a new amendment, and those who supported the &quot;Johnson&quot; ruling. Public opinion polls by Gallup show a downward trend in respondents supporting the amendment, from 71 percent in favor in 1989, to 68 percent in 1990, to 55 percent in 2005. A 2006 CNN poll showed similar figures, with 56 percent of respondents in favor, and 40 percent opposed. A 2006 Pew Research poll reported only 49 percent of respondents listing a flag burning amendment as &quot;very important&quot;.

The issue of flag burning remained controversial decades later. Protestors around the country continue to burn the flag as a form of anti-government protest, including during the Ferguson unrest in 2014, during the George Floyd protests in 2020, and during the abortion protests in 2022.

=== Legislative history ===
The Court&#x27;s ruling invalidated laws against desecrating the American flag, which at the time were enforced in every state except Alaska and Wyoming.

On June 22, 1989, one day after the ruling, the 101st Congress of the Senate passed a resolution to express &quot;profound disappointment&quot; in the Court&#x27;s decision, by a vote of 97-3. On June 27, the House of Representatives passed a resolution expressing &quot;profound concern&quot; with the decision, by a vote of 411-5. President George H. W. Bush was also strongly opposed to the ruling, calling flag burning &quot;dead wrong&quot;. Bush asked Congress to supersede &quot;Johnson&quot; by passing a new constitutional amendment to outlaw flag burning. On June 30, Bush spoke before a crowd at the Iwo Jima Memorial in Washington, D.C. to express his distaste for the Court&#x27;s decision, urging Congress to act quickly. On September 12, the House of Representatives passed a resolution that came to be known as the Flag Protection Act of 1989, which made it a federal crime to desecrate the flag in any way, including burning it. The bill passed the Senate on October 5, and was enacted into law without Bush&#x27;s signature.

The law was immediately challenged by Gregory Lee Johnson, who, along with three other protestors, burned the flag on the steps of the Capitol Building the day the law went into effect, on October 30, 1989. All four were charged in violation of the Flag Protection Act, but the charges against Johnson were dropped because he failed to ignite his flag. Johnson decried their refusal to prosecute him as a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot;, stating that he was &quot;outraged&quot;. The case against the remaining three protestors was dismissed by federal judges, citing &quot;Johnson&quot; as grounds, but attorneys appealed the case to the Supreme Court, who granted &quot;certiorari&quot; on March 31, 1990. In &quot;United States v. Eichman&quot; (1990), the Court once again upheld that flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment, with the same five justices in &quot;Johnson&quot; forming the majority. In an opinion also written by Justice Brennan, the Court declared the Flag Protection Act of 1989 unconstitutional and overruled it.

Since then, Congress has considered the Flag Desecration Amendment several times, first by the 104th Congress in 1995, and most recently by the 109th Congress in 2006. The resolution passed the House of Representatives three times but has never passed in the Senate. The most recent measure passed the House of Representatives on June 22, 2005, but failed by one vote in the Senate on June 27, 2006. Interest in the Flag Desecration Amendment was revived in 2020 when President Donald Trump said during a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma that he believed burning the flag should be punished with one year in jail. Trump later asked the Supreme Court to &quot;reconsider&quot; their flag burning rulings.

On July 20, 2016, Gregory Lee Johnson was again arrested for burning the American flag during the Republican National Convention, which was being held in Cleveland, Ohio. Prosecutors dropped the charges in January 2017 and the city of Cleveland agreed to pay Johnson $225,000 in settlements.

<doc id="555480" wikidata="Q1502477" url="?curid=555480" title="Chromosome (evolutionary algorithm)">
<text>A chromosome or genotype in evolutionary algorithms (EA) is a set of parameters which define a proposed solution of the problem that the evolutionary algorithm is trying to solve. The set of all solutions, also called &quot;individuals&quot; according to the biological model, is known as the &quot;population&quot;. The genome of an individual consists of one, more rarely of several, chromosomes and corresponds to the genetic representation of the task to be solved. A chromosome is composed of a set of genes, where a gene consists of one or more semantically connected parameters, which are often also called &quot;decision variables&quot;. They determine one or more phenotypic characteristics of the individual or at least have an influence on them. In the basic form of genetic algorithms, the chromosome is represented as a binary string, while in later variants and in EAs in general, a wide variety of other data structures are used.

==Chromosome design==
When creating the genetic representation of a task, it is determined which decision variables and other degrees of freedom of the task should be improved by the EA and possible additional heuristics and how the genotype-phenotype mapping should look like. The design of a chromosome translates these considerations into concrete data structures for which an EA then has to be selected, configured, extended, or, in the worst case, created. Finding a suitable representation of the problem domain for a chromosome is an important consideration, as a good representation will make the search easier by limiting the search space; similarly, a poorer representation will allow a larger search space. In this context, suitable mutation and crossover operators must also be found or newly defined to fit the chosen chromosome design. An important requirement for these operators is that they not only allow all points in the search space to be reached in principle, but also make this as easy as possible. 

The following requirements must be met by a well-suited chromosome:

* It must allow the accessibility of all admissible points in the search space.
* Design of the chromosome in such a way that it covers only the search space and no additional areas. so that there is no redundancy or only as little redundancy as possible.

* Observance of strong causality: small changes in the chromosome should only lead to small changes in the phenotype. This is also called locality of the relationship between search and problem space.
* Designing the chromosome in such a way that it excludes prohibited regions in the search space completely or as much as possible.

While the first requirement is indispensable, depending on the application and the EA used, one usually only has to be satisfied with fulfilling the remaining requirements as far as possible. The evolutionary search is supported and possibly considerably accelerated by a fulfillment as complete as possible.

== Examples of chromosomes ==

=== Chromosomes for binary codings ===
In their classical form, GAs use bit strings and map the decision variables to be optimized onto them. An example for one Boolean and three integer decision variables with the value ranges formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3 may illustrate this: 
Note that the negative number here is given in two&#x27;s complement. This straight forward representation uses five bits to represent the three values of formula_4, although two bits would suffice. This is a significant redundancy. An improved alternative, where 28 is to be added for the genotype-phenotype mapping, could look like this: 

 with formula_5.

=== Chromosomes with real-valued or integer genes ===
For the processing of tasks with real-valued or mixed-integer decision variables, EAs such as the evolution strategy or the real-coded GAs are suited. In the case of mixed-integer values, rounding is often used, but this represents some violation of the redundancy requirement. If the necessary precisions of the real values can be reasonably narrowed down, this violation can be remedied by using integer-coded GAs. For this purpose, the valid digits of real values are mapped to integers by multiplication with a suitable factor. For example, 12.380 becomes the integer 12380 by multiplying by 1000. This must of course be taken into account in genotype-phenotype mapping for evaluation and result presentation. A common form is a chromosome consisting of a list or an array of integer or real values.

=== Chromosomes for permutations ===
Combinatorial problems are mainly concerned with finding an optimal sequence of a set of elementary items. As an example, consider the problem of the traveling salesman who wants to visit a given number of cities exactly once on the shortest possible tour. The simplest and most obvious mapping onto a chromosome is to number the cities consecutively, to interpret a resulting sequence as permutation and to store it directly in a chromosome, where one gene corresponds to the ordinal number of a city. Then, however, the variation operators may only change the gene order and not remove or duplicate any genes. The chromosome thus contains the path of a possible tour to the cities. As an example the sequence formula_6 of nine cities may serve, to which the following chromosome corresponds:
In addition to this encoding frequently called &quot;path representation&quot;, there are several other ways of representing a permutation, for example the &quot;ordinal representation&quot; or the &quot;matrix representation&quot;.

=== Chromosomes for co-evolution ===
When a genetic representation contains, in addition to the decision variables, additional information that influences evolution and/or the mapping of the genotype to the phenotype and is itself subject to evolution, this is referred to as &quot;co-evolution&quot;. A typical example is the evolution strategy (ES), which includes one or more mutation step sizes as strategy parameters in each chromosome. Another example is an additional gene to control a selection heuristic for resource allocation in a scheduling tasks.

This approach is based on the assumption that good solutions are based on an appropriate selection of strategy parameters or on control gene(s) that influences genotype-phenotype mapping. The success of the ES gives evidence to this assumption.

=== Chromosomes for complex representations ===
The chromosomes presented above are well suited for processing tasks of continuous, mixed-integer, pure-integer or combinatorial optimization. For a combination of these optimization areas, on the other hand, it becomes increasingly difficult to map them to simple strings of values, depending on the task. The following extension of the gene concept is proposed by the EA GLEAM (General Learning Evolutionary Algorithm and Method) for this purpose: A gene is considered to be the description of an element or elementary trait of the phenotype, which may have multiple parameters. For this purpose, gene types are defined that contain as many parameters of the appropriate data type as are required to describe the particular element of the phenotype. A chromosome now consists of genes as data objects of the gene types, whereby, depending on the application, each gene type occurs exactly once as a gene or can be contained in the chromosome any number of times. The latter leads to chromosomes of dynamic length, as they are required for some problems. The gene type definitions also contain information on the permissible value ranges of the gene parameters, which are observed during chromosome generation and by corresponding mutations, so they cannot lead to lethal mutations. For tasks with a combinatorial part, there are suitable genetic operators that can move or reposition genes as a whole, i.e. with their parameters.
A scheduling task is used as an illustration, in which workflows are to be scheduled that require different numbers of heterogeneous resources. A workflow specifies which work steps can be processed in parallel and which have to be executed one after the other. In this context, heterogeneous resources mean different processing times at different costs in addition to different processing capabilities. Each scheduling operation therefore requires one or more parameters that determine the resource selection, where the value ranges of the parameters depend on the number of alternative resources available for each work step. A suitable chromosome provides one gene type per work step and in this case one corresponding gene, which has one parameter for each required resource. The order of genes determines the order of scheduling operations and, therefore, the precedence in case of allocation conflicts. The exemplary gene type definition of work step 15 with two resources, for which there are four and seven alternatives respectively, would then look as shown in the left image. Since the parameters represent indices in lists of available resources for the respective work step, their value range starts at 0. The right image shows an example of three genes of a chromosome belonging to the gene types in list representation. 
=== Chromosomes for tree representations ===
Tree representations in a chromosome are used by genetic programming, an EA type for generating computer programs or circuits. The trees correspond to the syntax trees generated by a compiler as internal representation when translating a computer program. The adjacent figure shows the syntax tree of a mathematical expression as an example. Mutation operators can rearrange, change or delete subtrees depending on the represented syntax structure. Recombination is performed by exchanging suitable subtrees.

<text>Vitalii Volodymyrovych Klychko (; ; born 19 July 1971), known as Vitali Klitschko, is a Ukrainian politician and former professional boxer. He serves as mayor of Kyiv, and is also head of the Kyiv City State Administration, having held both offices since June 2014. Klitschko is a former leader of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc, and is a former member of the Ukrainian Parliament. He became actively involved in Ukrainian politics in 2005 and combined this with his professional boxing career until his retirement from the sport in 2013. He holds a Doctoral Degree (Ph.D.) in &quot;Sports Science&quot; from Kyiv University&#x27;s Physical Science and Sports Department.

As a boxer, Klitschko won multiple world heavyweight championships. He held the World Boxing Organization (WBO) title from 1999 to 2000, the &quot;Ring&quot; magazine title from 2004 to 2005, and the World Boxing Council (WBC) title twice between 2004 and 2013. Overall, he defeated 15 opponents in world heavyweight title fights, and made 12 successful title defences. In 2011, Vitali and his younger brother Wladimir Klitschko entered the Guinness World Records as brothers with most world heavyweight title fight wins (30 at the time; 40 as of 2020). From 2006 until 2015, Vitali and Wladimir (also a multiple world champion) dominated heavyweight boxing, a period widely known as the &quot;Klitschko Era&quot; of the division. Klitschko&#x27;s last fight was in 2012, but he remained the WBC heavyweight champion at age 42 when he announced his retirement in December 2013.

Klitschko formally began his political career in 2006 when he placed second in the Kyiv mayoral race. In 2010, he founded the party Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (UDAR) and was elected for this party the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election. He was a leading figure in the 2013–2014 Euromaidan protests, and he announced his possible candidacy for the Ukrainian presidency but later withdrew and endorsed the eventual winner Petro Poroshenko. He was elected Mayor of Kyiv on 25 May 2014. He headed the election list of the winner of the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, the Petro Poroshenko Bloc but gave up his parliamentary seat to stay on as mayor of Kyiv. On 28 August 2015, the UDAR party merged into Petro Poroshenko Bloc, and Klitschko became the new party leader. Klitschko was reelected as mayor on 15 November 2015. Klitschko revived UDAR, and left Petro Poroshenko Bloc with it, in May 2019 and simultaneously announced that UDAR would take part in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election autonomously. UDAR failed to win any seats.

Klitschko was re-elected to a second term as mayor in the 2020 Kyiv local elections, securing 50.52% of the votes in the first round of voting and thus avoiding a run-off. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Klitschko has become an international symbol of Ukrainian resistance.

==Kickboxing and amateur boxing career==
Originally, as karate and kickboxing were both banned in the Soviet Union, and amateur boxing was one of five sanctioned combat sports available to general public (along with judo, sport sambo, freestyle and classical wrestling), Klitschko took up boxing, being trained by former Soviet boxer, 1974 World Championships bronze medalist Anatoliy Klimanov, a head boxing coach of the CSKA Kyiv Sports Club. After the ban was lifted and Soviets assembled their kickboxing team, Klitschko was a member. He was competing in amateur boxing, kickboxing, and sport karate simultaneously, showing considerable success in all combat sports in which he was involved.

Amateur boxing record: 11 wins (4 knockouts), 3 losses (0 knockouts)

Kickboxing record: 34 wins (22 knockouts,) 2 losses (2 knockouts.)

He was a kickboxing world champion six times (winning amateur world championships twice and professional championship tournaments four times). In 1996, he finished his amateur boxing career and turned professional, signing with the German-based Universum Box-Promotion (UBP.)

==Professional boxing career==

As an amateur, Klitschko won the super-heavyweight championship at the first World Military Games in Italy in 1995. In the same year he won a silver medal at the World Championships in Berlin, Germany, where he was defeated by Russia&#x27;s Alexei Lezin in the final. In his autobiography, published in Germany in 2004, the boxer revealed that he tested positive for a banned steroid in 1996. He attributed the presence of the drug to treatment of a leg injury, but was dismissed from the Ukrainian boxing team and missed the Atlanta Olympics. His brother Wladimir moved up from heavyweight to super heavyweight to take his place in the squad and won the Olympic gold medal. His amateur record was 195–15 with 80 knockouts.

===WBO heavyweight champion===

Klitschko began his professional boxing career in 1996, winning his first twenty-four fights by either early knockout or technical knockout. He and Wladimir signed with the German athlete-promotion company Universum. With both brothers holding PhDs and being multilingual, their refined and articulate personalities made for mainstream marketability when they moved to Germany and Universum. In time, they became national celebrities in their adopted home country. In his 25th pro fight on 26 June 1999, Klitschko won the WBO heavyweight title from Herbie Hide of the United Kingdom by a second-round knockout. He successfully defended the title twice. He defeated Ed Mahone by knockout in the third round and beat Obed Sullivan, who retired after the ninth round.

===Title loss to Byrd===

By April 2000 Klitschko was unbeaten and a rising star in the heavyweight division, having won all 27 of his contests by knockout. On 1 April, Klitschko had a third title defense against the American Chris Byrd, who was a late replacement. Byrd made himself a difficult target and tried to thwart Klitschko&#x27;s offense by being elusive. Klitschko won most of the rounds and was heading towards a comprehensive points victory when he suffered a serious shoulder injury. After the ninth round, Klitschko notified his corner that he had a shoulder pain and threw in the towel, thus handing Klitschko his first defeat and awarding Byrd the win by RTD. At the time of the stoppage, Klitschko had won 8 of 9 rounds on one judge&#x27;s scorecard, and 7 of 9 on the two others. Klitschko, who was later diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff, received much criticism for quitting the fight. Klitschko rebounded from his loss to Byrd by reeling off five victories in a row, earning himself a shot at WBC heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis.

===Klitschko vs. Lewis===

The fight between Lewis and Klitschko was to take place in December 2003, and Klitschko signed for a tune-up fight on 21 June 2003 as part of the undercard of Lewis&#x27;s fight with Kirk Johnson for the IBO title, as the WBC would not sanction the fight for their title. Johnson, however, pulled out of the fight due to injury and Klitschko, due to his being in training for a fight on the same day as Lewis, took the fight on short notice. Immediately after he accepted, the WBC elected to sanction the fight as a title match and Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Ring&quot; title was also up for grabs in addition to his lineal title.

Klitschko, a 4–1 underdog, dominated the early going with many harder punches. He stunned Lewis in the second round with two hard rights, leaving a cut under Lewis&#x27;s left eye. In the third, Lewis landed a big right hand that opened a deep cut above Klitschko&#x27;s left eye. Before the seventh round, the ringside doctor inspected the wound and deemed it severe enough to threaten eye damage if struck again, stopping the fight despite Klitschko&#x27;s pleas to continue. Klitschko was ahead on all three judges&#x27; scorecards 58–56 (4 rounds to 2) at the time of the stoppage, but because the wound was a result of punches from Lewis, Lewis won by technical knockout.

Negotiations for a 6 December rematch began. After negotiations collapsed, Klitschko defeated Kirk Johnson in a WBC eliminator bout on 6 December date, setting up a mandatory rematch with Lewis. In January 2004, the WBC announced that it would strip Lewis of the belt if he let pass a 15 March deadline to sign for a rematch with Klitschko. Shortly thereafter, Lewis announced his retirement and vacated the title. For years after this fight, Klitschko would occasionally call out Lewis for a rematch, despite the latter having retired in early 2004.

Around this time the Klitschko brothers moved from Hamburg, Germany, to Los Angeles. In January 2004 they notified Universum that they would not re-sign when their contracts expired in April. Universum sued the brothers, arguing that their recent injuries had triggered a clause binding them beyond April. The suit was ultimately resolved in favor of the Klitschkos in November 2009.

===WBC and &quot;The Ring&quot; heavyweight champion===

Klitschko faced South African Corrie Sanders on 24 April 2004 for the WBC heavyweight championship and &quot;The Ring&quot; belts that had been vacated by Lewis. Sanders had stopped younger brother Wladimir in the second round (TKO) on 8 March 2003. Klitschko took a heavy shot in round one by Sanders and was almost knocked down right at the end of the round, but by using upper-body movement and accurate punching he broke down Sanders over the following rounds, forcing referee Jon Schorle to stop the bout in the eighth. Klitschko landed 60% of his power punches.

===Klitschko vs. Williams===

Klitschko&#x27;s first WBC title defense was against British boxer Danny Williams. Williams had become suddenly marketable from a KO over Mike Tyson in round 4. Klitschko scored a technical knockout against Williams in 8 rounds on 11 December 2004, while wearing an orange cloth to show support for the Ukrainian presidential opposition movement. Klitschko knocked Williams down in the 1st, 3rd, 7th, and 8th rounds before the fight was stopped. Immediately afterward, Klitschko dedicated his victory to democracy in his native Ukraine and also to the Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko, whom he supported on 26 December 2004, election revote.
===2005–2007 retirement===
On 9 November 2005, Klitschko announced his retirement from professional boxing and vacated his title. He had been training to fight Hasim Rahman; however, nine days before the fight, he injured his leg while sparring. He snapped his anterior cruciate ligament, which with surgery would take up to a year to heal and possibly prove career ending. To avoid keeping the title out of use, he retired. The WBC was grateful for his consideration. On other occasions he cited regrets about his suddenly mounting injuries, a desire to leave the sport while still on top and political aspirations in his home country of Ukraine. Following his retirement, the WBC conferred &quot;champion emeritus&quot; status on Klitschko, and assured him he would become the mandatory challenger if and when he decided to return.

===Second WBC heavyweight championship===

On 3 August 2008 the WBC awarded Klitschko a chance to regain his WBC heavyweight title. After Vitali&#x27;s retirement, his younger brother had established dominance in the division, winning two of the four world titles available. The reigning WBC Champion was Samuel Peter (who had lost a decision to Wladimir in 2005). At the time, there was interest in a potential Peter vs. Wladimir unification match. Instead, Vitali took advantage of his champion emeritus status and secured a title challenge against Peter. The fight was arranged on 11 October 2008 at O2 World, Berlin. It would be one of the most anticipated heavyweight fights in the past few years. Both men had a rightful claim to being the champion and the stakes for the future of the heavyweight division were high. Despite some questioning Klitschko&#x27;s decision to return after almost four years, he managed to regain his title in dominating fashion. Klitschko had Peter intimidated from the first round and stunned him with accurate hard punches. Klitschko kept the hard-punching Nigerian off with an effective left jab and took control in the center of the ring. Over eight rounds, Klitschko completely dismantled and outfought the younger champion. After the eighth round, Peter slumped on his stool, shook his head and asked that the bout be stopped. With the Samuel Peter victory, Klitschko technically became one of the few men to ever hold a version of the world heavyweight title three times—WBO (1999–2000), WBC (2004–2005) and WBC (2008–2013).

===Klitschko vs. Gómez, Arreola, Johnson===
On 21 March 2009, Klitschko defeated Juan Carlos Gómez by TKO in the ninth round. Gómez tried to use his movement to thwart Klitschko but seemed unable to cope with the power and physical strength of his opponent. As the rounds progressed, Klitschko began imposing himself on Gómez more and more. Gómez soon became wary of Klitschko&#x27;s power and also began to tire physically. By the sixth round, Klitschko was in total control. The end came when the referee stopped the fight in the ninth round as Gómez appeared unable to withstand any more hits.

On 26 September, Klitschko earned a one-sided TKO victory over Chris Arreola at the Staples Center in Los Angeles when Arreola&#x27;s trainer, Henry Ramirez, asked the referee to stop the fight. Arreola was considered at the time one of the division&#x27;s hardest punchers; however, Klitschko kept Arreola at bay with his left jab and hit him almost at will with his right. Arreola had been influenced by Samuel Peter&#x27;s defeat to Klitschko in 2008, in which Peter had tried to box from the outside. He therefore employed a game-plan which involved applying constant pressure to Klitschko in order to force him into a high tempo fight. Despite his best efforts, the bout became one sided very quickly. Klitschko consistently proved himself faster, sharper and much fitter than Arreola.

On 12 December, Klitschko defeated Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision, winning almost every round. Johnson, a skillful fighter, tried to negate Klitschko&#x27;s strength with angles and head movement. Though he proved hard to hit, he failed to launch any sustained attack of his own. After the Johnson bout, Klitschko&#x27;s camp began negotiations for a potential fight with former WBA champion Nikolai Valuev, but the match failed to materialize due to economic disagreements.

===Klitschko vs. Sosnowski, Briggs, Solís===
On 29 May 2010, Klitschko defeated Polish heavyweight contender Albert Sosnowski by KO at 2:30 in round 10 of 12. Sosnowski was knocked down by a right hand in the 10th round, prompting referee Jay Nady to immediately wave off the fight. The fight took place at Veltins-Arena, Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
Klitschko weighed in at , while Sosnowski weighed in at .
This voluntary defense was Klitschko&#x27;s fourth defense of the WBC heavyweight title. Sosnowski was the No. 11 ranked heavyweight according to the WBC prior to this bout.

On 17 August 2010, it was announced that Klitschko would defend his WBC title against Shannon Briggs on 16 October of that year. Klitschko completely dismantled his challenger with superior hand speed. Briggs struggled to land any meaningful punches, as Klitschko won every round decisively. After a few rounds, Briggs was receiving a vicious and sustained beating which caused him serious facial injuries. Considering the beating he was receiving, there was some suggestion that the referee should have stopped the bout during the last few rounds. Klitschko had retained his belt with official scores of 120–107, 120–107, and 120–105.

During the post-fight interview, the American boxer Briggs said: &quot;I&#x27;ve fought George Foreman, I&#x27;ve fought Lennox Lewis, and Vitali&#x27;s the best.&quot; While Klitschko did not knock down Briggs, the latter collapsed after the fight and was hospitalized with facial fractures and a torn biceps.
Klitschko&#x27;s next fight was against mandatory challenger Odlanier Solís. The bout was tentatively scheduled for March 2011. On 11 January, it was officially confirmed that the fight between Klitschko and Solís was going to take place in Cologne, Germany on 19 March 2011. The fight lasted less than one whole round, as a right hand to Solís&#x27;s temple wobbled Solís, who then twisted his knee. Klitschko won by KO. Klitschko reportedly earned $15 million for the bout.

===Klitschko vs. Adamek, Chisora, Charr===

Now aged 40, Klitschko retained his WBC heavyweight title against Tomasz Adamek on 10 September 2011 in Poland, winning by TKO in the 10th round, in the first ever PPV fight in Polish TV history. The referee stopped the bout after Adamek received punishing blows and was ruled out, as he was no longer able to defend himself.

After turning 41 on 19 July 2012, Klitschko became one of the oldest heavyweight champions in history. Despite having a four-year hiatus from the sport, Klitschko had proven to be a remarkably effective and dominant heavyweight champion once again. Alongside his brother Wladimir, he also fights on for their shared ambition of holding all four heavyweight titles together, an ambition that was realised on 2 July 2011 when brother Wladimir defeated David Haye to win the WBA heavyweight title.

In January 2012, he was awarded WBC Fighter of the Year for 2011. Klitschko was in negotiations for a possible bout with former WBA heavyweight title holder David Haye on 3 March 2012.
After Wladimir Klitschko had to cancel his fight with Jean-Marc Mormeck, it was thought that Vitali was likely to fight on 25 February 2012. Sources in Germany reported that he was likely to fight British contender Derek Chisora on 18 February 2012 in Olympiahalle, Munich, Bavaria.
It was confirmed on 12 December 2011 that Derek Chisora would be Klitschko&#x27;s next opponent. Klitschko retained his WBC title unanimously in a dominant display in Munich. The fight was fought against a backdrop of antagonism displayed by Chisora at the weigh in. Chisora slapped Klitschko across the face causing a red mark to be left. The next day Chisora spat water over the face of Vitali&#x27;s brother Wladimir.

Vitali won the majority of the rounds boxing a disciplined fight with changing angles and superior footwork. Chisora, constantly coming forward delivering punishing body shots, failed to wear down the older man. The scores were: 118–110, 118–110, and 119–111. The next day Klitschko visited a hospital to check his shoulder, claiming he injured it in the fight. A doctor confirmed a ligament tear was suffered in his left shoulder. Klitschko said he &quot;suddenly lost strength in the left hand&quot; and was forced to only use his right. The injury was believed to have happened in the second or third round. Klitschko&#x27;s trainer, Fritz Sdunek, believes this is the same kind of injury Klitschko suffered in his fight with Byrd.

At the post-fight press conference, a brawl ensued between Haye and Chisora. After the altercation, Chisora challenged Haye to a fight in the ring and said, &quot;I am going to shoot David Haye.&quot; Chisora was later arrested at a German airport along with his coach, Don Charles. His comments and actions were later condemned by Frank Warren, his promoter, and Wladimir Klitschko.

On 2 July 2012, it was announced that Vitali would defend his WBC heavyweight title on 8 September at the Olympic Indoor Arena in Moscow, Russia. His opponent for the fight was undefeated future WBA heavyweight champion Manuel Charr 21–0 (11 KO). Klitschko won the fight via technical knockout when Charr had to be stopped due to a cut received from Klitschko&#x27;s punches.

Klitschko was expected to face Bermane Stiverne in a mandatory title defense but was forced to pull out due to injury.

===Retirement from boxing===
On 15 December 2013, Klitschko stepped back from boxing. He was announced champion emeritus, which means that if he wants to return to boxing, he can fight the WBC heavyweight champion without having any fights beforehand. But (right after his retirement from boxing), Klitschko stated &quot;That is something I currently cannot imagine&quot;. The WBC title was vacated and later contested by Chris Arreola and Bermane Stiverne. Commenting on his decision, he stated &quot;My focus is on politics in Ukraine and I feel the people there need me&quot;. He also added, &quot;I thank the WBC and its president José Sulaimán for the support in our battle for democracy and freedom in Ukraine&quot;. Since his retirement, he has maintained a limited level of training and has been in his brother&#x27;s corner for most fights, most famously when he had an altercation with Anthony Joshua after Anthony Joshua vs. Wladimir Klitschko.

==Political career==
===Early years in politics===

During the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election and the following Orange Revolution, the Klitschko brothers openly supported the candidacy of Viktor Yushchenko. In 2005, Vitali Klitschko was appointed an adviser to President Yushchenko. In October 2006, he was promoted to full-time adviser.

Klitschko began campaigning for Mayor of Kyiv shortly after his retirement in 2005. He lost the 2006 mayoral election to Leonid Chernovetskyi but placed second with 26% of the vote, ahead of the incumbent Oleksandr Omelchenko Klitschko campaigned on an anti-corruption platform and lead the bloc &quot;Civic party&quot; PORA-ROP (the parties PORA and Reforms and Order Party) in the simultaneously held local elections for the Kyiv City Council. Analysts stated his relatively late entry into the campaign might have cost him votes. Still, Klitschko was elected as a people&#x27;s deputy to the Kyiv City Council since &quot;Civic party&quot; PORA-ROP won 14 seats in the 2006 election. In the May 2008 Kyiv local election, he ran again and won 18% of the vote. Klitschko simultaneously led the Vitali Klitschko Bloc that won 10.61% of the votes and 15 seats and again, he was elected into the Kyiv City Council. His campaign hired Rudy Giuliani as a consultant for the campaign. In 2008, he was also appointed to the Ukrainian delegation of the Congress of the Council of Europe.

Klitschko became the leader of the political party Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (UDAR) in April 2010. During the 2010 Ukrainian local elections, the party won representatives in (Ukrainian) municipalities and Oblast Councils (regional parliaments).

Klitschko and UDAR became a partner of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in November 2011. UDAR is supported by the German government and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and received support in particular from Angela Merkel and also politicians from the conservative European People&#x27;s Party. According to information gained by the German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, the target was to &quot;set up Klitschko purposefully as a new strong man in Kyiv—in order to counter this way the Kremlin&#x27;s growing influence&quot;. Support consisted in logistics, training and joint performances. Assistance was also promised by Christoph Heusgen, Ronald Pofalla and Guido Westerwelle.
In October 2011, Klitschko announced that he would run in the 2012 Kyiv mayoral election.

During the 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election, Klitschko was elected (he was top candidate on UDAR&#x27;s party list) into the Ukrainian parliament; UDAR won 13.97% of the popular vote and 34 seats under the nationwide proportional party-list system, finishing third behind the Party of Regions and Fatherland, and another 6 seats in constituencies, thus a total of 40 seats. Support for UDAR was the least diversified at the regional level compared with the results of the other leading parties. Klitschko was chosen as the leader of the party&#x27;s faction in Parliament.

Klitschko announced on 24 October 2013 that he intended to take part in the next Ukrainian presidential election that was then set for 2015. That same day, the parliament voted for a bill adopting two amendments to the Tax Code, according to which a person who has permanent residency in a foreign state is considered to be a person who does not live in Ukraine; the law also had a provision according to which only a person &quot;permanently residing in Ukraine for ten years&quot; can run for the president. 239 deputies voted for the bill, mostly from the Party of Regions and the Communist Party. Experts and lawyers then argued that it was unclear if Klitschko could take part in these elections as, according to media reports, he had a residence permit in Germany.

Opinion polls since early 2011 showed that the predicted percentage of votes that Klitschko would gain in the first round of the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election enlarged from 4.8% in December 2011 to 15.1% in February 2013, and an October 2013 Razumkov Centre poll predicted 19.3%. According to all opinion polls but two conducted from January to November 2013 by the Razumkov Centre, Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), SOCIS, Rating, International Republican Institute and the Democratic Initiatives, Viktor Yanukovych and Klitschko were most likely to go into the second round. For the second round, all opinion polls conducted by same agencies during the same period of time had Vitali winning the potential run-off against Yanukovych, predicting Vitali to earn from 58% to 64%.

Klitschko was one of the dominant figures of the Euromaidan protests. During these protests, he retired from boxing.

===Political views (until 2013)===
Klitschko is in favor of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union. He sees the European Union as Ukraine&#x27;s &quot;model for [Ukraine&#x27;s] future political and economic development.&quot; He believes former President Viktor Yanukovych and his government were &quot;deliberately destroying the integration (into Europe) prospects of Ukraine&quot; and that Ukrainian politicians have no right to let them &quot;rule after 2014&quot;. Klitschko is also in favour of NATO-Ukraine cooperation.
Klitschko&#x27;s main concern is social standards and the economy of Ukraine. He believes &quot;the issue of language is not the top priority&quot;. Klitschko wants less corruption and more transparency in Ukrainian politics. He also advocates lower taxes to stimulate the economy. Klitschko did accuse in October 2011 President Yanukovych and the Azarov Government of &quot;doing everything to manipulate the rules to stay in power longer&quot;; furthermore (in December 2011) he assert(ed) &quot;every statement of the government&quot; as &quot;a continuation of lies and disinformation.&quot; He has also taken part in rallies for former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko&#x27;s release.

In December 2011, Klitschko described the judicial system of Ukraine as &quot;complete degradation&quot; and accused it of violating human rights and humiliating its prisoners. According to him, Ukraine lacks independent and unbiased judges because the &quot;Ukrainian judiciary is currently a closed system with lifelong judges and appointments made through administrative leverage&quot;. He wants to ensure the independence of judges by switching from a system of appointed judges to a system of elected judges.

In July 2012, Klitschko stated that UDAR would not cooperate with the Party of Regions in the Ukrainian Parliament. In early April 2013 Klitschko called for early presidential and parliamentary elections in Ukraine.

===Mayor of Kyiv===

On 28 February 2014, Klitschko confirmed that he would take part in the (early) 2014 Ukrainian presidential election. On 29 March, he announced that he had changed his mind and would run for the post of Mayor of Kyiv in the 2014 Kyiv local election (including Mayoral elections) set for 25 May. In the 2014 Ukrainian presidential election Klitschko endorsed the candidacy of Petro Poroshenko. Klitschko won Kyiv&#x27;s mayoral elections with almost 57% of the votes in the first round. He was sworn in as mayor on 5 June 2014. The same day the Ukrainian parliament had deprived Klitschko of his MP mandate (Ukrainian MPs are not entitled to combine parliamentary activities with any other public employment). Poroshenko was elected President of Ukraine on 25 May 2014.

In addition to mayoral elections, UDAR participated in the 2014 Kyiv local election. It won 30 seats in the party-list ballot (40.54% of votes) and 42 seats in constituencies, overall gaining 77 seats in the Kyiv City Council out of 120. This was the last time that half of the Kyiv City Council seats were elected in constituencies.

Poroshenko appointed Klitschko as head of Kyiv City State Administration on 25 June 2014.

Klitschko headed the election list of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc in the late October 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, but he vowed not to resign as Mayor of Kyiv. On 21 November 2014 Klitschko gave up his seat in the new parliament. Petro Poroshenko Bloc won the election with 132 seats out of 423 available.

On 28 August 2015, UDAR merged into Petro Poroshenko Bloc &quot;Solidarity&quot;. Klitschko became the new party leader. In the 2015 Kyiv mayoral election, Klitschko was reelected with 66.5% of vote. For this, he needed a second round of mayoral elections between him and Boryslav Bereza, after Klitschko scored 40.5% of the vote and Bereza 8.8% in the first round. (Bereza gained 33.51% of the vote in the second round of Mayoral elections.) Petro Poroshenko Bloc gained 52 seats in the Kyiv City Council with 27.56% of votes. On 26 May 2016, Klitschko resigned as Petro Poroshenko Bloc chairman, after a new law barring a head of administration to be chairman or a member of a political party took effect on 1 May.
On 18 May 2019, Klitschko announced that UDAR would take part in the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election autonomously.&lt;ref name=&quot;7215407/ Klitschko&quot;&gt; Klitschko said that UDAR will go to the polls , Ukrayinska Pravda (May 18, 2019)&lt;/ref&gt; In the election the party only competed in 15 single-mandate constituencies. It failed to win any seats.

According to the Ukrainian Constitution the head of the Kyiv City State Administration should resign after a new President is elected. However, following the 21 April 2019 election which was won by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Klitschko was not dismissed. A 4 September 2019 decision by the Honcharuk Government to dismiss Klitschko was not executed.

In the election for Mayor of Kyiv of the 2020 Kyiv local elections, Klitschko was again a candidate, nominated by UDAR. He was also endorsed by Petro Poroshenko&#x27;s party, now named European Solidarity. He won the election in the first round with 50.52% of the votes, 365,161 people voted for him. UDAR won 30 Kyiv City Council seats out of 120 in the 2020 Kyiv local election with 19.98% of votes, finishing second behind European Solidarity (20.52% of votes; 31 seats). As of 23 June 2024, Klitschko is the longest-serving Mayor of Kyiv since Ukraine gained its independence in 1991, having served for over 10 years, and the only person to have won three direct democratic Kyiv mayoral elections.

Klitschko is a member of the Washington, D.C.-headquartered International Republican Institute&#x27;s International Advisory Council.

====Russian invasion of Ukraine====

In February 2022, Klitschko and his brother Wladimir Klitschko pledged to take up arms to protect the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, in response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine that began on 24 February. On 25 February, Klitschko posted a video on his Telegram channel to report on casualties in the capital city, stating, &quot;The night was difficult, but there are no Russian troops in the capital. The enemy is trying to break into the city, in particular, from [the direction of] Hostomel, Zhytomyr.&quot; On 11 March Klitschko made a guest appearance on CNN&#x27;s &quot;State of the Union&quot;.

On 15 March, Klitschko announced a 36-hour curfew from Tuesday night amid what he called a difficult and dangerous moment, stating, &quot;I ask all Kyivites to get prepared to stay at home for two days, or if the sirens go off, in the shelters,&quot; About half of Kyiv&#x27;s 3.4 million residents had fled. On 23 March, Klitschko and his brother reported from a bandstand in a park victories around Kyiv: Ukrainian forces had taken back most of Irpin (east of Kyiv), all of Makariv (west of Kyiv) and were battling for the village of Liutizh, 20 miles to the north. By 31 March, Russian forces had withdrawn from Kyiv.

On 10 March 2022, Vitali and Wladimir announced via Telegram that they had raised €100 million of financial support for Ukraine with a fundraising campaign in Germany.

On 6 May, Klitschko warned that there was a high probability of rocket fire across Ukraine in the coming days. There were no plans for a curfew but street patrols would be reinforced. On 23 May, Klitschko and Ukraine Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba were in Davos, Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum annual meeting. Klitschko and his brother spoke at length to an audience the same day. They told delegates to back Ukraine despite the economic pain, and that &quot;we are defending you&quot;. They later said in an interview with Sky News, that the &quot;biggest mistake&quot; their audience could make was to think that the &quot;Ukraine war doesn&#x27;t affect everyone.&quot;

On 18 June, Klitschko said that Vladimir Putin was destroying millions of lives in both Ukraine and Russia, adding that Russian soldiers are dying for nothing more than Putin&#x27;s ambitions. At the end of June, the Klitschko brothers attended, along with a large delegation of Ukrainians, the 2022 NATO Madrid summit.

On 23 July 2022, &quot;The Times&quot; posted an article in which it alleged that Vitali and Wladimir were on Vladimir Putin&#x27;s personal hitlist of 24 high-profile Ukrainian figures whom he wanted assassinated.

In a December 2023 interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Klitschko accused President Zelenskyy of authoritarianism due to the president&#x27;s use of powers under martial law. Of the president, Klitschko said, &quot;At some point we will no longer be any different from Russia, where everything depends on the whim of one man.&quot;
==Sporting legacy==
Having never been knocked down, Vitali Klitschko is widely regarded as the tougher fighter of the two brothers. His 87% knockout percentage is regarded as one of the best knockout-to-fight ratios of any champion in heavyweight boxing history. Vitali was also known for being unusually dominant in his fights, having rarely lost a round in his professional career as a boxer.
During his time as WBC champion, Vitali Klitschko was described as being the best of his time, and George Foreman stated that he has the best straight left in the division. Both Klitschko brothers are considered the best heavyweight boxers of their era. Having remained undefeated for a large majority of their careers and refusing to fight each other, both brothers remained largely unchallenged throughout their careers. Notably, both brothers were particularly well known for using their large size to nullify other heavyweights. In 2011, Wladimir and Vitali entered the Guinness World Records book as the pair of brothers with most world heavyweight title fight wins (30 at the time; 40 as of 2020).

Considered national heroes in Ukraine, in 2008 the Klitschko brothers were ranked number 15 in Inter&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Ukrainians&quot; following a nation-wide poll that saw around 2.5 million people casting their votes. Boxing fights involving one of the Klitschko brothers attracted between 10 and 20 million viewers in Ukraine; some of their fights generated even bigger viewership numbers. Vitali has been named multiple times among the 100 most influential people in Ukraine by Korrespondent: he was ranked 60th in 2006, 44th in 2010, 41st in 2011, 16th in 2012, 10th in 2013, 23rd in 2017 and 28th in 2019 (the ranking wasn&#x27;t conducted between 2014 and 2016).

The Klitschkos were also considered big stars in Germany. A survey carried out by TNS for the Horizont Sport Business in 2003 showed that 90.9% of respondents recognized Vitali while 70.7% celebrated his successes, making him the sixth most recognized and second most beloved athlete in Germany at the time. According to DW, another research conducted no later than 2011 showed that nearly 99% of people in Germany recognized the Klitschko brothers. The CPI Index conducted by the agency Celebrity Performance in 2012 had the Klitschkos ranked second on the list of the most marketable celebrities in Germany, while in January 2014, based on a survey of 1151 respondents that was conducted by the same agency, the Klitschko brothers were ranked 6th in the &quot;2013 Person of the Year&quot; category. At least nine of Vitali&#x27;s fights generated above 9 million average viewers. The Rammstein song Sonne was written as his entrance song.

Throughout his career, Vitali has defeated 15 boxers for the world heavyweight title, the fifth-most in history (tied with Lennox Lewis), including two – Corrie Sanders and Danny Williams – for &quot;The Ring&quot; world heavyweight championship. Klitschko is one of nine boxers to defeat at least ten different fighters for the world heavyweight title. As of August 2022, BoxRec ranks Klitschko among the 50 greatest European boxers of all time. He is the only heavyweight boxer to have reigned as world champion in three different decades. Klitschko and George Foreman are the only heavyweight boxers in history to defend a world title after turning 40. According to BoxRec, Vitali has defeated 7 previously undefeated fighters with a combined record 135–0–3 (95 KOs) – these 7 included Alben Belinski (professional record 5–0, 5 KOs coming into the fight), Ed Mahone (21–0–2, 21 KOs), Timo Hoffmann (22–0, 13 KOs), Chris Arreola (27–0, 24 KOs), Kevin Johnson (22–0–1, 9 KOs), Odlanier Solis (17–0, 12 KOs) and Manuel Charr (21–0, 11 KOs). Vitali has defeated 7 current or former world champions throughout his career. Those included heavyweight champions Corrie Sanders, Shannon Briggs and Samuel Peter, two-weight world champion Tomasz Adamek, and cruiserweight champions Juan Carlos Gomez and Orlin Norris.

At the end of 2004, Vitali was honoured with the Hero of Ukraine Order of State, the highest Ukrainian honour, for his achievements and contributions to the development of Ukrainian sports. In 2010, Vitali was awarded the German Cross of the Order of Merit, the highest German honour, for his social and political engagement. In 2013, Klitschko was awarded the Georgian Presidential Order of Excellence. In 2018, Vitali was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. He was elected in his first year of eligibility. Known for charity work and philanthropy, both Vitali and Wladimir are among only 15 current or former alive athletes that have been named UNESCO Champions for Sport.

== Personal life ==
Klitschko&#x27;s father, Volodymyr Rodionovych Klitschko (1947–2011), was a Soviet Air Force major general and a Soviet military attaché in East Germany. Volodymyr&#x27;s mother was Jewish. Part of Vitali&#x27;s family died during Holodomor, while his great-grandfather and family members on the female line of his mother died in the Holocaust.

The Klitschko brothers lived as children in Czechoslovakia from 1980 to 1985, where their father was stationed with the Soviet Forces. They attended a school designated for children of Soviet soldiers in the town of Mimoň in Northern Bohemia.

The Klitschko brothers lived in Pripyat, Ukrainian SSR from 1985 to 1986, when the town was evacuated following the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. The elder Klitschko was also one of the commanders in charge of cleaning up the effects of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 and was afterward diagnosed with cancer. He also served as a military attache at the embassy of Ukraine in Germany. His mother is Nadiya Ulyanivna.

Klitschko worked at Kyiv Automation Plant as a toolmaker as a young man.

In December 2013, Mykola Chynchyn, the chairman of the Main Investigation Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine during the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych, accused Klitschko of having worked as a debt collector in the 1990s for mafia boss Viktor Rybalko. Klitschko has vehemently denied links to Rybalko.

Klitschko and Natalija Jehorova, a former athlete and model, married on 26 April 1996. They have three children. On 15 August 2022, Vitali announced that he and Natalija were divorcing.
In 1996, Klitschko graduated from the Pereyaslav-Khmelnytsky Pedagogical Institute (Ukraine) and was accepted into the postgraduate study program at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. On 29 February 2000, he presented his doctoral thesis on &quot;talent and sponsorship in sports&quot; at the &quot;Kyiv University of Physical Science and Sports&quot; and his PhD in Sports Science was conferred.

In addition to residing in Kyiv, Klitschko has lived for years in Germany. According to Klitschko &quot;Germany adopted me, I really love Germany, but I&#x27;m not German&quot;.

Both Klitschko and his brother Wladimir are avid chess players. Vitali is a friend of former world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik and the two have played, with Kramnik always winning. Klitschko has commented that &quot;chess is similar to boxing. You need to develop a strategy, and you need to think two or three steps ahead about what your opponent is doing. You have to be smart. But what&#x27;s the difference between chess and boxing? In chess, nobody is an expert, but everybody plays. In boxing everybody is an expert, but nobody fights.&quot;

Both Klitschko brothers also have been involved in charitable activities dedicated to supporting the needs of schools, churches and children. In 2002, the Klitschko brothers announced that they had agreed to work for UNESCO. Vitali and his brother never fought each other in a professional fight as their mother made them promise to never fight each other.

Klitschko is fluent in four languages: Ukrainian, Russian, English and German.

<text>Oliver Ames (February 4, 1831 – October 22, 1895) was an American businessman, investor, philanthropist, and Republican politician who served as the 35th governor of Massachusetts from 1887 to 1890.

Ames&#x27;s public life was primarily devoted to the vindication of his late father Oakes Ames, a businessman and U.S. Representative who was censured for his role in the 1873 Credit Mobilier scandal and died shortly thereafter. His tenure in office was also marked by a divide within the state over the growing temperance movement.

Ames was executor of his father&#x27;s estate, and took over many of his business interests. He was a major philanthropist, especially in his hometown of Easton, where he secured construction of a number of architecturally significant works by the architect H.H. Richardson and a number of properties by landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted.

==Early life and education==

Oliver Ames was born in Easton, Massachusetts on February 4, 1831 to Eveline Orville (née Gilmore) and Oakes Ames. His father was the owner (with his father and brother, each also named Oliver) of Ames Shovel Shop, the largest manufacturer of shovels in the United States.

Ames was educated in the local schools, and then attended private academies in North Attleborough and Leicester. He was briefly employed at the family factory before enrolling at Brown University in 1851. He spent three years there in a custom-designed program overseen by university president Francis Wayland.

==Business career==
After leaving Brown, Ames entered the family business, learning all aspects of its manufacturing processes and worked as a traveling salesman.

Ames served in the Massachusetts militia under the 4th Massachusetts Regiment, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1857, but resigned before the American Civil War began. During the war, he oversaw the company&#x27;s manufacturing department, expanding the business and making the manufacturing processes more efficient. The family also invested in railroads and other industrial concerns. Oliver became a partner in the company when his grandfather Oliver Ames Sr. died in 1863.

===Credit Mobilier scandal and death of Oakes Ames===

Oakes and Oliver Ames Jr., Ames&#x27;s father and uncle, were leading figures in the Union Pacific Railroad as well as principals in Crédit Mobilier of America, a shell corporation established by Union Pacific insiders to siphon profits from the railroad&#x27;s construction. While a member of Congress, Oakes Ames sold shares of Crédit Mobiler to other Congressmen well below their estimated market value. When this was exposed in 1872, a congressional committee determined it a bribe for the purpose of influencing railroad legislation. The scandal resulted in Oakes Ames&#x27;s censure and he died not long afterward.

Ames inherited his father&#x27;s fortune, nationwide network of business interests, and $6–8 million in debt related to the scandal. He was also co-executor to his father&#x27;s estate. Over a period of years, Ames was able to pay off the debts, provide more than $1 million in bequests, and divide the estate amongst the heirs.

===Legal battle with Jay Gould===

In 1875, financier Jay Gould gained control of the Union Pacific, while a group of Ames-dominated Boston investors retained control of Crédit Mobilier.

Crédit Mobilier remained mired in legal action related to the scandal, and its shares were a major component of Oakes Ames&#x27;s estate. The company&#x27;s only major asset was a $2 million note against UP, and Ames instigated legal action to recover its value.
Gould and Union Pacific countersued and conducted a hostile takeover of Crédit Mobilier, ousting Ames from the company&#x27;s board and discontinuing its lawsuit. Ames launched legal action as a shareholder, and succeeded in forcing CM into receivership in 1879 with himself as the receiver. Their legal wrangling largely subsided in 1880, when most of the holdout shareholders were bought out by Gould.

During their fight, Ames sold Gould his controlling interest in the Central Branch Union Pacific Railroad, a separate paper railroad chartered to provide service in Kansas, at $250 per share. Ames made a large profit on the sale, which Gould purchased in order to assemble the pieces of a full transcontinental rail network under the Union Pacific umbrella.

==Early political career==
Ames entered public life intent on vindicating his late father&#x27;s memory. His early political activities included sitting on Easton&#x27;s School Committee and chairing the local Republican Party committee.

===State senator===
He was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in 1879 and saw to the incorporation of the new town of Cottage City, where he owned a summer home. He also sat on the committees overseeing railroads and schools. He was re-elected in 1881.

===Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts (1883–86)===
In 1882, Ames was nominated for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. Though he won his race, Republican Robert R. Bishop lost the gubernatorial election to Democrat Benjamin Butler in a bitterly divisive contest. Ames served from 1883 to 1886 under Butler (1883) and Republican George D. Robinson (1884–86).

In 1883, the Massachusetts legislature passed a resolution exonerating Ames&#x27;s father and calling on Congress to reverse his censure. While in office, he also state&#x27;s divestment from the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the Hoosac Tunnel at 1/3 of par value. He was at first criticized for the relatively low price, but it was later seen to be a good deal.

==Governor of Massachusetts (1887–90)==
With Governor Robinson retiring in 1886, Ames won election as Governor of Massachusetts and served three one-year terms. A major political issues in his first two campaigns was his resignation from the state militia before the American Civil War. Ames countered criticisms by pointing out that he had hired a substitute to serve in his place and had financially supported the Union war effort.

As governor, Ames was a competent administrator, hiring and promoting more on the basis of merit than politics. In 1887 he signed a bill exempting military veterans from recently enacted civil service regulations, earning him the ire of the state&#x27;s progressives. A project to expand the Massachusetts State House was approved during his tenure, and he in 1889 helped lay the cornerstone for its new elements.

===Education===
He advocated the improvement of public schools, as a counter to private religious schools. During his second term, he donated $1,000 to the College of the Holy Cross, which upset anti-Catholics in the state and cost him votes in his third election against William E. Russell.

===Temperance===
Ames supported the work of the Massachusetts Temperance Society but was opposed to the legislated prohibition of alcohol. He became unpopular with advocates of temperance. In 1889, the legislature passed a state constitutional amendment enacting prohibition, but it was voted down in the required popular referendum that followed.

==Retirement and death==
In 1888, his health began to fail, probably due to the strain of office and his business interests. He refused to run for reelection in 1889, continuing a party tradition of three-term governors. After leaving office, he traveled to Europe several times to relax and recover his health. He died at his North Easton home in 1895.

==Personal life and legacy==
===Family===

Ames married Anna Coffin Ray of Nantucket in 1860. The couple had six children. Their youngest son, Oakes Ames, was a well-known American botanist and orchid expert who owned palatial properties in Boston, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and North Easton.

===Honors===
Ames was elected an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity in 1917, by the fraternity&#x27;s Alpha Chapter at the New England Conservatory in Boston. He is the only known member to receive such a posthumous offer.

===Legacy===
Ames was a major financier of Easton&#x27;s public high school, and it is named Oliver Ames High School in his honor. He is also the namesake of the small community of Oliver, Nebraska and of the schooner &quot;Governor Ames&quot;, in which he was invested.

With his cousin Frederick Lothrop Ames, Ames financed the construction of many projects designed by architect H. H. Richardson and landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted in North Easton, including Oakes Ames Memorial Hall and the Ames Free Library. The site of these properties is now the H. H. Richardson Historic District of North Easton, a National Historic Landmark District.

Ames was a patron of sports and the arts. He owned Booth&#x27;s Theatre in New York City and raised funds to send members of the Boston Athletic Association to the 1896 Summer Olympics.

He was at one time the president of the Merchants&#x27; Club of Boston, and he was also president of the Boston Art Club.

<text>James Barr Ames (June 22, 1846 – January 8, 1910) was an American law educator, who popularized the &quot;case-study&quot; method of teaching law.

==Biography==
Ames was born in Boston, Massachusetts on June 22, 1846; son of Samuel T. and Mary H. (Barr) Ames and grandson of James Barr, M.D. He received his primary education in Boston, then graduated from Harvard College in 1868 (A.B.), and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1872 (LL.B). He began working as a tutor and instructor at Harvard in 1871, and continued until 1873, when he was admitted to the bar. Although a licensed lawyer, Ames did not open a private practice, spending his full-time at Harvard during his entire career, as tutor (French and German, 1871-72), instructor (History, 1872-73), assistant professor (Law, 1873-1877), full professor (Law, 1877-1895), and dean of the Law School (1895-1910).

Ames married Sarah Russell (born September 22, 1851) on June 28, 1880.

He died in Wilton, New Hampshire, on January 8, 1910.

==Harvard legal career==
Ames has been called &quot;the foremost teacher of law of his time, being not only an exceptionally broad and accurate scholar, and a profound student of the history of common law, but also having special ability in the development of clear and exact thought in those under his instruction.&quot;

In teaching law to his Harvard students, Ames used actual legal cases to illustrate legal principles, a concept which had been developed by Christopher Columbus Langdell. Ames insisted that legal education should require the study of actual cases instead of abstract principles of law. He was instrumental in introducing the case method in the teaching of law, a method which had come into general use in US law schools at the time of his death, and which continues to the present. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1878. He was a manager of the 1907-founded Comparative Law Bureau of the American Bar Association, whose &quot;Annual Bulletin&quot; was the first comparative law journal in the U.S.
Ames had received the degree of LL.D. from six universities by the time of his passing.

<text>Andrew Mark Cuomo ( , ; born December 6, 1957) is an American politician, lawyer, and former government official who served as the 56th governor of New York from 2011 until his resignation in 2021. A member of the Democratic Party and son of former governor Mario Cuomo, Cuomo previously served as the attorney general of New York from 2007 to 2010.

Born in Queens, New York City, Cuomo is a graduate of Fordham University and Albany Law School. He began his career working as the campaign manager for his father in the 1982 New York gubernatorial election. Later, Cuomo entered the private practice of law and chaired the New York City Homeless Commission from 1990 to 1993. Cuomo then served in the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development as assistant secretary from 1993 to 1997 and as secretary from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. Cuomo was elected New York attorney general in 2006, after a failed bid to win the Democratic primary in the 2002 New York gubernatorial election.

Cuomo won the 2010 Democratic primary for governor of New York and won the general election with over 60 percent of the vote. He was re-elected in 2014 and 2018. During his governorship, Cuomo signed legislation to legalize same-sex marriage, medical use of cannabis, and recreational use of cannabis. Cuomo&#x27;s administration oversaw the construction of the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, the Second Avenue Subway, the Moynihan Train Hall, and a reconstruction of LaGuardia Airport. He also decommissioned the Indian Point nuclear plant, which led to an uptick in greenhouse gas emissions. In response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and the 2012 Webster shooting, Cuomo signed the NY SAFE Act of 2013, the strictest gun control law in the United States. He also delivered Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act; a 2011 tax code that raised taxes for the wealthy and lowered taxes for the middle class; 12-week paid family leave; and a gradual increase of the state&#x27;s minimum wage to $15 per hour. Cuomo received national attention for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. Although he was initially lauded for his response, he faced renewed criticism and federal investigation after it was alleged that his administration covered up information pertaining to COVID-19 deaths among nursing home residents who died in hospitals. Investigations by both the Department of Justice and the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s Office were officially closed as a result of no evidence of wrongdoing.

Beginning in late 2020, Cuomo faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. An investigation commissioned by New York attorney general Letitia James reported in August 2021 that Cuomo sexually harassed at least eleven women during his time in office, for which Cuomo faced criminal investigations, however she declined to file criminal charges against him. Following the release of the attorney general&#x27;s report, Cuomo was called to resign by President Joe Biden. On August 23, despite denying all allegations of sexual harassment, Cuomo resigned from office and was succeeded by his lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul. At the time of his resignation, he was the longest-serving governor in the United States.

The release also prompted district attorneys for Manhattan, Nassau County, Westchester County, Albany County and Oswego County to pursue criminal investigations; however all of the investigations were closed without any charges being brought against him.

On March 1, 2025, Cuomo announced his intention to run for Mayor of New York City in 2025.

== Early life and education ==
Andrew Mark Cuomo was born on December 6, 1957, in the New York City borough of Queens to lawyer and later governor of New York Mario Cuomo and Matilda (&quot;née&quot; Raffa). His parents were both of Italian descent; his paternal grandparents were from Nocera Inferiore and Tramonti in the Campania region of southern Italy, while his maternal grandparents were from Sicily (his grandfather from Messina). He has four siblings; his younger brother, Chris Cuomo, is a current NewsNation anchor and a former CNN journalist, and his elder sister is noted radiologist Margaret Cuomo.

Cuomo graduated from Archbishop Molloy High School in 1975. He earned a Bachelor of Arts from Fordham University in 1979 and a Juris Doctor from Albany Law School in 1982.

== Early career ==
During his father&#x27;s successful 1982 campaign for governor, Cuomo served as campaign manager. He then joined the governor&#x27;s staff as a policy advisor and sometime Albany roommate, earning $1 a year. As a member of his father&#x27;s administration, Cuomo was known as the &quot;enforcer&quot; where his father was known as the &quot;nice guy&quot; in a good cop/bad cop dynamic to further advance his father&#x27;s legislative agenda.

From 1984 to 1985, Cuomo was a New York assistant district attorney and briefly worked at the law firm of Blutrich, Falcone &amp; Miller. He founded Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged (HELP) in 1986 and left his law firm to run HELP full time in 1988. From 1990 to 1993, during the administration of New York City mayor David Dinkins, Cuomo was chair of the New York City Homeless Commission, which was responsible for developing policies to address homelessness in the city and providing more housing options.

== Secretary of Housing and Urban Development ==

Cuomo was appointed Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in 1993, a member of President Bill Clinton&#x27;s administration. After the departure of Secretary Henry Cisneros at the end of Clinton&#x27;s first term under the cloud of an FBI investigation, Cuomo was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate to succeed him as Secretary of HUD. Cuomo served as Secretary from January 1997 until the Clinton administration ended in 2001.

In 2000, Cuomo led HUD efforts to negotiate an agreement with United States handgun manufacturer Smith &amp; Wesson. This agreement required Smith &amp; Wesson to change the design, distribution, and marketing of guns to make them safer and to help keep them out of the hands of children and criminals. Budgets enacted during Cuomo&#x27;s term contained initiatives to increase the supply of affordable housing and home ownership and to create jobs and economic development. These included new rental assistance subsidies, reforms to integrate public housing, higher limits on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration, a crackdown on housing discrimination, expanded programs to help homeless people get housing and jobs, and creation of new empowerment zones.
During Cuomo&#x27;s tenure as HUD Secretary, he called for an increase in home ownership. He also pushed government-sponsored lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy more home loans issued to poor homeowners in an attempt to end discrimination against minorities. Some believe that this helped lead to the 2007–2010 subprime mortgage crisis. Edward J. Pinto, former chief credit officer at Fannie Mae, said: &quot;They should have known the risks were large.&quot; Pinto said, &quot;Cuomo was pushing mortgage bankers to make loans and basically saying you have to offer a loan to everybody.&quot; But others disagree with the assessment that Cuomo caused the crisis. Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said Cuomo &quot;was a contributor in terms of him being a cheerleader, but I don&#x27;t think we can pin too much blame on him&quot;.

According to libertarian author and critic James Bovard, Cuomo was obsessed with changing HUD&#x27;s image, as Cuomo declared, &quot;The PR is the important thing I do... Eighty percent of the battle is communications.&quot; He championed a new program called Community Builders, created without appropriation by Congress, for 800 new HUD employees with computers to be paid as much as $100,000. In a June 16, 1999, speech, Cuomo declared that one purpose of the program was to fight against HUD&#x27;s abolition. In August 1999, Community Builders distributed a letter to community groups to fight against proposed tax cuts. One HUD official declared that Community Builders was seen as &quot;Democratic ward heelers who act as a pipeline between Democratic city officials, party leaders, and the administration and the Democratic National Committee.&quot;

In 1998, Clinton-appointed HUD inspector general Susan Gaffney testified to a Senate committee that she was the victim of escalating&#x27; attacks on her office by Cuomo and &#x27;his key aides,&#x27; including cooked-up charges of racism, insubordination, malfeasance, and general dirty-dealing&quot;. In 1999, Gaffney&#x27;s office concluded that &quot;most (15 out of 19) Community Builders&#x27; goals were activities rather than actual accomplishments&quot; and that Cuomo&#x27;s initiatives &quot;had a crippling effect on many of HUD&#x27;s ongoing operations&quot;. Gaffney retired in May 2001, shortly after the department reached a $490,000 settlement with a black employee who had accused her of racial discrimination in passing him over for a promotion.

Prior to Cuomo&#x27;s tenure, HUD was routinely included on the General Accounting Office&#x27;s biannual watch list of government programs whose poor management made them prone to fraud. During his time in office, two of HUD&#x27;s four main departments were removed from the GAO list. In addition, the department cut 15 percent of its staff as part of a Cuomo initiative to streamline its operations.

==Private sector==
From 2001 to 2006, Cuomo was not in government. He worked at the Fried Frank law firm from 2001 to 2004 and later the Island Capital real estate firm.

== 2002 New York gubernatorial election ==

Cuomo first ran for the Democratic nomination for the New York governor seat in 2002. He was initially the favorite for the nomination and led in fundraising and polls, but his campaign took serious damage after a gaffe. Speaking about the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Cuomo said, &quot;Pataki stood behind the leader. He held the leader&#x27;s coat. He was a great assistant to the leader. But he was not a leader. Cream rises to the top, and Rudy Giuliani rose to the top.&quot; His remarks were widely derided; even his father, former governor Mario Cuomo, later admitted it was a blunder.

On the eve of the state convention, Cuomo withdrew from consideration after concluding that he had little chance of support against the favored party candidate, State Comptroller Carl McCall. McCall went on to lose the general election to incumbent George Pataki.

== New York attorney general ==
=== Election ===

Cuomo declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for New York state attorney general in 2006 and on May 30, 2006, captured the Democratic Party&#x27;s endorsement, receiving 65% of the delegates. Though Cuomo won the endorsement, former New York City public advocate Mark Green and two-time candidate for Lieutenant Governor Charlie King also earned places on the Democratic ballot. King dropped out of the race before the primary and endorsed Cuomo.

Cuomo won the primary with a majority of the vote, defeating his nearest opponent by over 20%. Clinching the Democratic party nomination was considered a significant rebound following his unsuccessful and unpopular 2002 gubernatorial campaign, and at the nominating convention June O&#x27;Neill, the Democratic chairwoman of St. Lawrence County, called him &quot;New York&#x27;s own Comeback Kid&quot;. In the general election on November 7, 2006, he defeated the Republican nominee, former Westchester district attorney Jeanine Pirro, winning 58% of the vote.

=== Tenure ===
==== Police surveillance, 2007 ====

On July 23, 2007, Cuomo&#x27;s office admonished the Spitzer administration for ordering the New York State Police to keep special records of then Senate majority leader Joseph Bruno&#x27;s whereabouts when he traveled with police escorts in New York City. At the discretion of top officials of the Spitzer administration, the created documents meant to cause political damage to Bruno. Spitzer responded by accepting responsibility and issuing an apology to Bruno.

==== Student loan inquiry, 2007 ====
In 2007, Cuomo was active in a high-profile investigation into lending practices and anti-competitive relationships between student lenders and universities. Specifically, many universities steered student borrowers to a &quot;preferred lender&quot;, which resulted in the borrowers&#x27; incurring higher interest rates. This led to changes in lending policy at many major American universities. Many universities also rebated millions of dollars in fees to affected borrowers.
==== Usenet, 2008 ====
On June 10, 2008, Cuomo announced that three major Internet service providers (Verizon Communications, Time Warner Cable, and Sprint) would &quot;shut down major sources of online child pornography&quot; by no longer hosting many Usenet groups. Time Warner Cable ceased offering Usenet altogether, Sprint ended access to the 18,408 newsgroups in the alt.* hierarchy, and Verizon limited its Usenet offerings to the approximately 3,000 Big 8 newsgroups. The move came after Cuomo&#x27;s office located 88 different newsgroups to which child pornography had been posted.

==== 2008 Obama remarks ====
In 2008, Cuomo said of the Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama, who was running against Hillary Clinton, the candidate Cuomo supported: &quot;You can&#x27;t shuck and jive at a press conference.&quot; Cuomo received criticism from some for his use of the phrase. Roland Martin of CNN said that &quot;&#x27;Shucking and jiving&#x27; have long been words used as a negative assessment of African Americans, along the lines of a &#x27;foot shufflin&#x27; Negro&#x27;. In fact, I don&#x27;t recall ever hearing the phrase used in reference to anyone white.&quot;

==== Corruption and fraud investigations, 2009 ====
Cuomo investigated a corruption scandal, a &quot;fraudulent scheme to extract kickbacks&quot;, which involved New York investigators, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and attorneys general in dozens of states.

== Consideration for U.S. Senate appointment ==

After Hillary Clinton became President Obama&#x27;s choice for U.S. secretary of state in December 2008, then–New York governor David Paterson was charged with appointing a temporary replacement until a special election. Cuomo was seen as a leading contender for this appointment. Caroline Kennedy (who is a first cousin of Cuomo&#x27;s ex-wife) was another leading contender, but withdrew for personal reasons two days before Paterson was set to announce his choice, leaving Cuomo and U.S. representative Kirsten Gillibrand as the most likely appointees. On January 23, Paterson announced he would appoint Gillibrand to the U.S. Senate.

== Gubernatorial elections ==
=== 2010 ===

On September 18, 2009, advisors to President Barack Obama informed Governor David Paterson that the president believed he should withdraw his 2010 gubernatorial candidacy, stepping aside for &quot;popular Attorney General Andrew Cuomo&quot;. On January 23, 2010, the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; reported that Cuomo would announce plans for a gubernatorial campaign at the end of March. Later reports indicated Cuomo would announce his gubernatorial campaign coinciding with the state Democratic Convention in late May. On May 22, 2010, Cuomo announced his run for governor in a video posted to his campaign website. Cuomo announced his choice for lieutenant governor on May 26, 2010: Robert Duffy, Mayor of Rochester.

In the November 2, 2010, general election, Cuomo faced Republican Carl Paladino, a Buffalo-based businessman who had been heavily supported by the Tea Party movement. Cuomo won the election for governor by a landslide, winning 62.6% of the vote. Paladino performed strongly in his native Buffalo area, while Cuomo performed well in the eastern part of the state as well as downstate.

In addition to the parties fielding candidates, New York&#x27;s electoral fusion laws allow parties to cross-endorse candidates. The Independence Party and Working Families Party cross-endorsed Andrew Cuomo, while the Conservative Party and Taxpayers Party cross-endorsed Carl Paladino. The Independence Party line received 146,648 votes (5.0% of Cuomo&#x27;s total, and 3.2% of the statewide total) and the Working Families line received 154,853 votes (5.3% and 3.4%), with the Democratic line receiving the remaining 2,610,220 votes (89.6% and 56.5%). The Conservative line received 232,281 votes (15.0% of Paladino&#x27;s total, and 5.0% of the statewide total) and the Taxpayers line received 25,821 votes (1.5% and 0.6%), with the Republican line receiving the remaining 1,290,082 votes (83.3% and 27.1%).

=== 2014 ===

Cuomo sought reelection in 2014, with former U.S. representative Kathy Hochul as his new running mate. On March 5, 2014, Westchester County executive Rob Astorino announced that he would run on the Republican ticket against Cuomo for governor. Law professors Zephyr Teachout and Tim Wu challenged the Cuomo–Hochul ticket in the Democratic primary electioncapturing 34% of the vote on the gubernatorial line (Wu drew 40.1% as lieutenant governor). On November 4, 2014, Cuomo was reelected for a second term with 54% of the vote, while Astorino received 40.6% of the vote.

Despite low voter turnout, Cuomo won the general election by a comfortable margin; however, his margin of victory was smaller than it had been in his 2010 victory. Astorino won most of upstate New York but was overwhelmed in New York City. Cuomo was sworn in for his second term as governor.

=== 2018 ===

Cuomo was challenged in the primary from the left by actress and activist Cynthia Nixon. She criticized him for having failed to fix the New York City Subway following his declaration of the 2017 New York City transit crisis as well as for not protecting undocumented immigrants, not legalizing recreational marijuana, and not creating a single-payer healthcare system. When debating Nixon, Cuomo countered her argument on the subways by pointing out that the system is owned by New York City, though past administrations agree it is the governor&#x27;s role. An analysis conducted by New York City comptroller Scott Stringer revealed that New York City pays for 70 percent of subway repair costs.

Cuomo defeated Nixon, 65.5–34.5%.

On November 6, 2018, the Cuomo-Hochul ticket defeated the Molinaro-Killian ticket by a margin of 59.6% to 36.2%.

On March 19, 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in an episode of their podcast &quot;The Daily&quot;, leaked audio of Cuomo threatening Bill Lipton, head of the Working Families Party, which had endorsed primary opponent Nixon, that &quot;[i]f you ever say, &#x27;Well he&#x27;s better than a Republican&#x27; again, then I&#x27;m gonna say, &#x27;You&#x27;re better than a child rapist.&#x27;&quot;

===2022===

In May 2019, Governor Cuomo announced he would run for a fourth term. In August 2021, after a report released by the attorney general of New York, Letitia James, detailed accusations of sexual harassment by Governor Cuomo and his attempts to silence victims, the New York State Legislature&#x27;s leaders indicated that they would seek to remove Cuomo from office. While denouncing the report&#x27;s findings as political and maintaining his
innocence, in the face of almost certain removal from office, he announced his resignation as Governor, effective August 24, 2021. Although there was no formal withdrawal, individuals close to Cuomo indicated he would likely not seek his party&#x27;s nomination following his resignation.

== Governor of New York (2011–2021)==

Cuomo took the gubernatorial oath of office at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 2011, succeeding David Paterson. During his first year as governor, Cuomo worked to pass an on-time budget that cut spending without raising taxes, made a new deal with a large state-employee union, signed ethics reform legislation, passed a property tax cap, worked to enact a same-sex marriage bill with bipartisan support, and restructured New York&#x27;s tax code.

In 2014, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Cuomo had been actively involved in the formation of the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC) three years earlier, which gave control of the state senate to Republicans. He has been accused of failing to bridge the rift between the IDC and the Democratic caucus in the Senate.
There was media speculation about a possible presidential run, either in 2016 or 2020. Several reports indicated that Cuomo supported the Independent Democratic Conference until its dissolution and defeat in 2018 in part to appear more moderate for an eventual presidential bid. Cuomo denied these allegations, and in 2018 was responsible for reuniting the IDC with the mainstream Democratic conference.

For his 2018 re-election bid, Cuomo accepted being on top of the ballot line for the Independence Party, a list that featured numerous Republicans, including ardent Trump supporters.

In an August 15, 2018, anti-sex trafficking bill-signing event, Cuomo said: &quot;We&#x27;re not gonna make America great again. It was never that great. We have not reached greatness. We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.&quot; The assembled audience of Cuomo&#x27;s supporters booed.

In a February 2019 opinion poll, Cuomo&#x27;s approval rating dropped to 43 percent, the lowest of his tenure as governor, and a full 50% said they disapproved. The poll showed an eight-percent drop from January 2019; it was taken after Cuomo signed several pieces of progressive legislation, including an expansion of abortion rights and access and stricter gun laws, suggesting that the legislation may have upset certain voters and contributed to the drop; however, the majority of voters agreed with his position on both issues. By early 2020, Cuomo&#x27;s favorability rating was up to 77 percent, a record high.

=== Appointee donations controversy ===
On his first day in office, Cuomo renewed an executive order signed by Eliot Spitzer which prohibited Governors of New York from receiving donations from gubernatorial appointees. A February 2018 investigation by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, revealed that the Cuomo administration had quietly reinterpreted the order, and that Cuomo had collected $890,000 from 24 of his appointees, as well as $1.3 million from the spouses, children and businesses of appointees. Some donations were made to Cuomo just days after the donor was appointed.

In March 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Cuomo had rewritten the disclaimer language on his campaign website for the executive order barring donations from appointees. The website added two caveats whereby some gubernatorial appointees are allowed to donate to the governor, which &quot;The Times&quot; said could potentially lead to more donations from appointees to the governor. The Cuomo campaign returned a $2,500 donation from one appointee who was in violation of the new disclaimer, but retained approximately $890,000 raised from other appointees.

From the time of Utah governor Gary Herbert&#x27;s retirement on January 4, 2021, until his resignation on August 23, 2021, Cuomo was the longest-serving governor in the United States still in position, with 3,887 days in office.

=== Corporate incentives ===
Cuomo has supported providing tax and other incentives to attract business to locate in New York State. He even joked in 2018 that he would be willing to change his name to &quot;Amazon Cuomo&quot; if Amazon located their &quot;Amazon HQ2&quot; in the state. His strong support for New York City&#x27;s bid to become the home of Amazon&#x27;s HQ2 faced criticism based on arguments that the costs to the state outweighed the possible benefits. Amazon decided on two &quot;major corporate outposts&quot;, in New York City and Arlington, Virginia, instead of a single second headquarters, before bowing out of the former under local pressure.

=== COVID-19 pandemic response ===
On March 1, 2020, Cuomo issued a statement regarding novel coronavirus in New York wherein he mentioned the first positive case of novel coronavirus in New York State. On March 2, 2020, Cuomo said that community transmission of the new coronavirus is &quot;inevitable&quot;. He also mentioned New York City&#x27;s plans to aggressively ramp up diagnostic testing for the new virus and said that he would like to see New York City conducting &quot;1,000 tests per day&quot;. He announced the &quot;world-renowned&quot; Wadsworth Center was partnering with hospitals to expand surge testing capacity to &quot;1,000 tests per day statewide&quot; for the novel coronavirus. On March 3, 2020, Cuomo signed a $40 million emergency management authorization for coronavirus response and claimed that &quot;New York&#x27;s overall risk remained low&quot;. He also announced the institution of a new cleaning protocol at schools and in the public transportation system &quot;to help stop any potential spread of the virus&quot;. On March 4, 2020, Cuomo confirmed nine new cases in the state and said that it was &quot;literally like trying to stop air&quot; and that it was inevitable that it would continue to spread.

On March 6, 2020, Cuomo criticized the federal government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 outbreak, calling it &quot;absurd and nonsensical&quot;.

Early in the coronavirus response efforts, Cuomo received widespread praise from epidemiologists for his handling of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic in New York State, including a statewide lockdown and a shutdown of nonessential businesses in an effort to help flatten the curve of the virus. At the same time, however, Cuomo also received criticism for failing to grasp the gravity of the pandemic before its risks were fully visible to the American public.

On March 28, 2020, Cuomo threatened Rhode Island with a lawsuit over a state quarantine policy enforcing quarantine on arriving New Yorkers.

In the spring of 2020, social media posters and television hosts such as Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, and Ellen DeGeneres came up with the term &quot;Cuomosexuals&quot; to express admiration and love for the governor and his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, related to their leadership roles during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In June 2021, Cuomo lifted COVID-19 restrictions, following the news that 70% of adults had one shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Between July and August 2020, it was alleged that Cuomo utilized state resources and property, including assigning work by Executive Chamber government staffers to compile materials and perform frequent work on the drafting of his book on a non-voluntary basis. In October 2020, Cuomo published his book, &quot;American Crisis&quot;, proclaiming victory against the pandemic due to his leadership. He wrote that New York &quot;confronted and defeated&quot; the virus, although the state had the highest per capita hospitalization rate in the country by February 2021. Cuomo was paid more than $5 million to write the book.

In November 2020, Cuomo received the International Emmy Founders Award from the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for his coronavirus briefings. On August 24, 2021, the morning after his departure, the academy rescinded the Emmy award due to the New York Attorney General&#x27;s report on sexual harassment allegations against him.

On December 14, 2021, Cuomo was ordered by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics to pay New York state $5.1 million in book profits he made during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commission reversed the prior approval after complaints that Cuomo used state resources, including personnel used to edit, write, prepare, and gather data to write &quot;American Crisis&quot;. Cuomo was ordered to return proceeds from the book by January 13, 2022. Cuomo denied these claims and sued the joint commission on public ethics alleging they acted improperly. In August 2022 the state appellate court upheld a lower court decision finding that New York&#x27;s current ethics watchdog commission was unconstitutional. Cuomo won the lawsuit and was permitted to keep the proceeds from the sale of the book.

Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in his state, nine state health officials resigned, reportedly in response to Cuomo&#x27;s policies. In a press conference on January 29, 2021, Cuomo stated that he did not trust the expertise of health officials.

=== Criminal justice ===
In August 2017, the Cuomo administration awarded more than $7 million, financed with money from large bank settlements, in grants to New York colleges to offer courses to New York prisoners. In January 2018, Cuomo proposed reforms that would &quot;reduce delays during trials, ban asset seizures in cases where there has been no conviction and make it easier for former convicts to get a job after leaving prison&quot;. He also called for an end to cash bail for minor crimes.

Under Cuomo&#x27;s tenure, he granted commutations to fewer prisoners than many previous Republican and Democratic New York governors. Cuomo commuted a total of nine sentences. Cuomo pardoned 140 adults who were convicted of nonviolent felonies as 16- and 17-year-olds, but had served their sentences. He pardoned 18 others who had served their sentences for nonviolent felonies but were exposed to deportation due to their criminal record.

=== Environment ===
In 2017, Cuomo announced that the Indian Point nuclear plant, which produced one quarter of New York City&#x27;s power, would be phased out. As a result of the phaseout, the carbon-free power generated by the plant was replaced by power generated by carbon-generating fossil fuels. As a consequence, New York was estimated to struggle to meet its climate goals.

=== Gun control and &quot;gravity knives&quot;===
On January 15, 2013, Cuomo signed into law the first state gun control bill to pass after the December 14, 2012, Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in neighboring Connecticut. The NY SAFE Act was described as the toughest gun control law in the United States. The act came under criticism, and the National Rifle Association called it draconian. The New York State Sheriffs&#x27; Association issued a statement supporting tougher penalties for illegal use of firearms but criticizing several aspects of the legislation, including a magazine limit of seven rounds and a &quot;too broad&quot; definition of assault weapons.

On July 5, 2013, Cuomo signed an amendment to the NY SAFE Act that exempts retired police officers from some of the act&#x27;s ownership restrictions.

On April 2, 2018, Cuomo announced the passage of new legislation that prevents those who have been convicted of domestic violence from possessing any kind of firearms as well as losing their gun license.

On February 25, 2019, Cuomo signed the &quot;red flag&quot; gun protection law, allowing a court to temporarily prohibit someone from buying or possessing a gun if they are deemed a threat to themselves or others.

On July 30, 2019, Cuomo signed two laws banning the manufacture and sale of 3D printed guns and the other requiring safe storage of firearms when children younger than 16 years of age live in a gun owner&#x27;s home.

On July 7, 2021, Cuomo declared the first &#x27;disaster emergency&#x27; in the United States on gun crime for New York.

Cuomo also resisted repeated efforts by the Legislature to decriminalize the so-called &quot;gravity knife,&quot; which had resulted in many arrests of individuals (disproportionately African-American and/or Hispanic) who used these folding knives for work, but not as weapons. Cuomo vetoed the first two attempts by the Legislature to decriminalize folding knives that could be opened with one hand by a &quot;wrist-flick,&quot; but, on May 30, 2019, signed into law a repeal of the Penal Code provision that had listed the &quot;gravity knife&quot; as a prohibited weapon. Cuomo&#x27;s memorandum on signing the repeal bill noted: &quot;As I review this bill for a third time, the legal landscape has changed. In March of this year, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York declared the State&#x27;s existing &#x27;gravity knife&#x27; ban unconstitutional. As argued by many who have advocated for this change in law, the court reasoned that the existing law could result in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.&quot; This was a reference to the case of &quot;Cracco v. Vance&quot;, a case decided by Judge Paul A. Crotty some two months earlier.

=== Hurricane Sandy ===

After Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, Cuomo allowed New York voters, via a specific provision aimed at accommodating those displaced, to cast provisional ballots for the 2012 election anywhere in the state. He also appointed a commission to examine the responses of New York utilities to damage caused by the storm.

Controversy ensued when the Cuomo administration used $140 million, including $40 million of federal disaster relief funds, to pay for the broadcast of national TV ads promoting &quot;New New York&quot; slogans outside New York in an attempt to attract new business investment to the state. Many have been critical of the effort, including former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, who called the ads &quot;fluff&quot; and &quot;a waste of taxpayer money&quot;.

=== Hydraulic fracturing ===

In June 2012, the Cuomo administration said it was considering lifting a state ban on the practice of hydraulic fracturing (also known as &quot;fracking&quot;) to stimulate the economy in upstate New York. But critics said that fracking upstate could contaminate the water supply of New York City, New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania. Following a long-awaited study started years earlier, New York State health officials cited &quot;significant public health risks&quot; associated with fracking, and on December 17, 2014, the Cuomo administration announced a ban on hydraulic fracturing in New York State.

=== Israel ===
In solidarity with Israel, Cuomo announced an executive order against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Cuomo tweeted: &quot;If you boycott Israel, New York State will boycott you.&quot;

===Marijuana legalization===
In January 2014, Cuomo announced an executive order to allow the limited use of medical marijuana in New York. Later that year, a comprehensive bill to legalize medical cannabis was passed by the state legislature, containing some restrictions at Cuomo&#x27;s insistence such as a ban on consumption by smoking. On July 5, 2014, the Compassionate Care Act was signed into law by Governor Cuomo.

In December 2018, Cuomo announced his support for legalizing the recreational use of cannabis, after previously stating his opposition and calling it a &quot;gateway drug&quot; as recently as February 2017. On March 31, 2021, recreational use of cannabis was officially legalized with the signing into law of the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act by Governor Cuomo.

=== New York City Subway ===
In June 2017, after a series of subway disasters, Cuomo declared a &quot;state of emergency&quot; for the New York City Subway system. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a series of New York City mayors and New York governors, including Cuomo, were partly at fault for the worsening quality of the subway system and inflated construction costs. Under the Cuomo administration, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority repeatedly diverted tax revenues earmarked for the subways, paid for services that there was no need for and spent on subway projects that did not boost service or reliability. As a result, the MTA was saddled with debt and could not undertake investments into overhauling outdated and inefficient subway infrastructure. Cuomo also directed the MTA to spend on projects that the heads of the MTA did not consider to be priorities. One reason why the New York City subway system is so expensive is due to exorbitant labor costs; according to several M.T.A. officials who were involved in negotiating labor contracts, Cuomo pressured the MTA to accept labor union contracts that were extremely favorable to workers. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Cuomo was closely aligned with the union in question and had received $165,000 in campaign contributions from it.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;Cuomo had steered clear of the M.T.A. during his first years in office, but in his second term he took an intense interest. He placed aides within the organization and, in an unusual move, made some report directly to him. He badgered transit leaders about the construction of the Second Avenue subway on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. And over the objections of some board members, he canceled several M.T.A. capital projects to make room for his own priorities. According to high-ranking current and former M.T.A. officials, the moves interfered with the authority&#x27;s plans to address the rising delays.&quot;

=== Public college and university tuition ===
On April 18, 2017, Cuomo signed the New York State 2018 fiscal year budget. It included the Excelsior Scholarship, a provision that families making less than $125,000 in 2019 could have free tuition at all SUNY and CUNY universities, though some education experts including Sara Goldrick-Rab say it won&#x27;t help the poorest students and that the requirement that recipients live and work in New York after graduating is counter-productive.

=== Public employees ===
On July 16, 2011, Cuomo finalized a five-year deal with the Public Employees Federation to end pay raises, implement furlough days, and require additional contributions to health insurance accounts. In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he stated his top goal in 2012 is the reduction of public employee pensions.

=== Public housing ===
In the winter of 2018, Cuomo responded to a class-action lawsuit brought against the New York City Housing Authority by attorney Jim Walden on behalf of a group of public housing tenants. The suit was the first of its kind and called upon NYCHA to immediately address decrepit and unhealthy conditions in public housing units across New York City. By early April, Cuomo appointed an independent monitor to oversee NYCHA on an emergency basis.

=== Remarks about right-wing conservatives ===
In a January 17, 2014, interview with Susan Arbetter on WCNY&#x27;s &quot;The Capital Pressroom&quot;, Cuomo stated:

This remark received a major reaction in the conservative media. Radio host Glenn Beck wrote a letter to the governor regarding the remarks from the interview. Fox News contributor and radio/TV show host Sean Hannity threatened to move out of the state with all of his assets if Cuomo did not apologize for his remarks. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said during a radio broadcast that Cuomo&#x27;s remarks were &quot;most unfortunate at best. Are there pro-lifers who are extremist? Yes, there are. But I think they are a distinct minority.&quot;

The New York State Democratic Committee, which is headed by Cuomo, supported his remarks and reiterated them in a May 2014 statement responding to a speech by Rob Astorino, who was running against him in the 2014 gubernatorial election: &quot;Tea Party Republicans have done enough damage in Washington, today&#x27;s speech made it abundantly clear that we don&#x27;t need them here in New York.&quot;

=== Same-sex marriage ===

In keeping with a campaign promise, Cuomo signed the &quot;Marriage Equality Act&quot;, introducing same-sex marriage, on June 24, 2011, following an &quot;intense public and private lobbying campaign&quot;, and later called for all states to do the same. Cuomo was lauded for his efforts to pass same-sex marriage legislation. One prominent advocate stated that for gay Americans, Cuomo was &quot;the only national politician with hero status&quot;. Following the passage of the Act, Cuomo was criticized for describing the viewpoints of opponents as &quot;anti-American&quot;. On July 25, 2011, a lawsuit was filed in the New York Supreme Court seeking an injunction against the Act, alleging corruption and violations of the law in the process of passing the bill. The trial court initially held that the plaintiffs&#x27; case could proceed, but the decision was reversed on appeal.

Cuomo ordered a boycott of Indiana and North Carolina to protest their legislation on LGBT issues.

=== Start-Up NY ===
In July 2016, the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency, released a report indicating that the state&#x27;s flagship business tax incentive program, called Start-Up NY, had generated 408 jobs since its inception in 2014. Ads promoting the program had cost at least $53 million. The Start-Up NY annual report was delayed three months in 2016, leading some lawmakers, such as Assemblyman Schimminger, to call the delays &quot;curious&quot;.

=== Taxes ===

Cuomo was praised for his 2011 restructuring of the New York State tax code. He was also criticized for allegedly requesting a unanimous Assembly vote in favor of the proposal and threatening to campaign against Assembly members who voted &quot;no&quot; – a charge he denied. Cuomo also received criticism from voices on the left who felt that the tax reform was insufficient. Hoping that the Federal cap on state and local tax deductions will be repealed, Cuomo signed a tax increase on high income workers and corporations and the wealthy worth over one million dollars in 2021. The increase extends until the year 2027.

=== Voting rights ===
In April 2018, Cuomo announced that he would restore the voting rights of parolees through an executive order. He said that he would consider restoring the voting rights of all parolees (more than 35,000), and would also enfranchise new parolees throughout his term.

=== Women&#x27;s issues and abortion ===
In 2013, Cuomo called for the passage of a Women&#x27;s Equality Act. The Women&#x27;s Equality Act included 10 component bills affecting issues such as domestic violence, human trafficking, and pregnancy discrimination. The tenth bill of the Women&#x27;s Equality Act was the Reproductive Health Act, which would have &quot;enshrine[d] in state law existing federal protections for abortion rights&quot;, &quot;shift[ed] the state&#x27;s abortion law from the criminal code to the health care laws&quot;, and &quot;[made] it clearer that licensed health care practitioners as well as physicians could perform abortions&quot;. During his 2013 State of the State address, Cuomo said, &quot;Enact a Reproductive Health Act because it is her body, it is her choice. Because it&#x27;s her body, it&#x27;s her choice. Because it&#x27;s her body, it&#x27;s her choice.&quot; The New York State Assembly passed the Women&#x27;s Equality Act on June 20, 2013. The Republican leadership of the New York State Senate expressed support for the nine non-abortion-related planks of the Women&#x27;s Equality Act, but objected to the Reproductive Health Act and expressed unwillingness to allow a vote on it.

On the final day of the 2013 legislative session, following the Senate Republican Conference&#x27;s continued refusal to vote on the full Women&#x27;s Equality Act, Senator Jeff Klein, leader of the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), offered the abortion plank of the Act as a hostile amendment to another bill. The amendment was defeated by a narrow margin of 32–31; all 30 Senate Republicans voted against the abortion amendment, as did Democratic Sens. Ruben Diaz and Simcha Felder. The Senate proceeded to pass the nine non-abortion-related planks of the Women&#x27;s Equality Act as separate bills, and the 2013 legislative session came to an end without any portion of the WEA becoming law.

&quot;[After] the 2014 election season was over, with Cuomo victorious, the governor and his lieutenant governor Kathy Hochul both declared the abortion plank of the act officially dormant, if not dead.&quot; In 2015, the non-abortion-related Women&#x27;s Equality Act bills passed both houses of the State Legislature. In October 2015, Cuomo signed eight of the 10 Women&#x27;s Equality Act bills into law; the abortion rights bill was not among them.

On January 22, 2019, Cuomo signed the 2019 version of the Reproductive Health Act, which passed days after Democrats took control of the state Senate. Cuomo ordered One World Trade Center and other landmarks to be lit in pink to celebrate the bill&#x27;s passage. Cuomo&#x27;s signing and the lighting of the World Trade Center building sparked intense criticism from conservatives. The Catholic cardinal Timothy Dolan criticized Cuomo over the Reproductive Health Act.

==Controversies==
=== Official corruption ===
In July 2014, it was reported that the Moreland Commission, a committee established by Cuomo to root out corruption in politics, was directed away from investigations that could be politically damaging. Cuomo later disbanded the commission. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan launched an inquiry into Cuomo&#x27;s dealings with the anti-corruption panel and concluded that &quot;after a thorough investigation&quot;, there was &quot;insufficient evidence to prove a federal crime&quot;.

In September 2016, Joseph Percoco, a close friend and former top aide to Cuomo, was indicted as part of a bribery investigation into the Buffalo Billion. He had worked for Cuomo in both Washington and Albany and had managed his 2010 and 2014 gubernatorial campaigns. Todd Howe, a lobbyist and former Cuomo aide, was also indicted, along with several developers who were major donors to Cuomo and other state politicians. Cuomo was not accused of wrongdoing.

In March 2018, a federal jury in Manhattan convicted Percoco on felony charges of solicitation of bribes and honest services fraud for over $315,000 in bribes he took from two people seeking official favors on behalf of an energy company, Competitive Power Ventures Inc. Following Percoco&#x27;s conviction, Cuomo released a statement declaring that he would respect the jury&#x27;s verdict and that &quot;there is no tolerance for any violation of the public trust&quot;. In September 2018, Judge Valerie Caproni sentenced Percoco to 6 years in prison. In May 2023, the Supreme Court unanimously overturned his bribery conviction.

In March 2021, allegations came out that Cuomo prioritized COVID-19 tests for his family and other associates during the early stages of the pandemic when tests were limited. Particular scrutiny went to the positive test of his brother Chris in March 2020 amid other conflicts of interest that commentators saw in their relationship. These reports were investigated during his impeachment probe but were not included in the final impeachment report.

=== Book ethics scandal ===
In mid 2021, the Joint Commission on Public Ethics(JCOPE) started investigated a publication deal Cuomo made over his book named &quot;American Crisis: Leadership lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic&quot;. The reason behind starting the investigation were allegations that Cuomo used tax payer money to write and create the book. The $5.1 million after taxes that the book garnered was also considered to be very controversial, as some considered he had used his position to promote the book. 

On November 16th, 2021 the JCOPE revoked its prior authorization for Cuomo to publish his book, and ordered the suspension of any further printing. The reasoning behind the decision was stated to be that Cuomo utilized state staff, buildings, and resources in writing, editing, and publishing the book. Cuomo and his spokesperson repeatedly claimed that they had done no wrong doing, and the staff did those actions as a voluntary act. Without passing a reapproval for the publishing after requests, the JCOPE ordered Cuomo on December 14th, to forfeit the entire $5.1 million to the state of New York via the attorney general. 

Cuomo would go to court, and the State Supreme Court would end up ruling that the JCOPE unconstitutional and that sanctions against Cuomo violate due process as it does not have the authority to place sanctions for violating the operational rules of JCOPE itself. However, the court would state that the Commission on Ethics and Lobbying(COEAL) is allowed to open a new investigation on what JCOPE had accused Cuomo for. The COEAL is a new ethics commission that was formed after JCOPE was shutdown. COEAL would eventually start such investigation. 

Cuomo would once again go to court to file an appeal against the investigation being done by the new commission. Cuomo claimed that the new commission was also too independent, and thus challenging its constitutional authority. On September 11th, the New York State Supreme Court ruled in Cuomo&#x27;s favor. The court claimed that the new commission was also unconstitutional, claiming that “Our Constitution, which so carefully allocates power among the three branches, will not permit those powers to be transferred to (an) independent commission amounting to an unsanctioned fourth branch of government”. The state immediately announced they were looking into appealing this court decision. Cuomo would once again win his case in the mid-level appeals court that sided with the September 11th ruling.

This ruling was also appealed to the New York State High Court of Appeals, where trial hearings started on January 7th, 2025. Government advocate Rachel Fauss would state that if the court were to side with previous rulings, it would mean the end of ethics enforcement in the state. On February 18th, 2025 the top court declared that the new commission is constitutional, and thus the probe on Cuomo&#x27;s book continues.

===COVID-19 nursing home deaths===

On March 25, 2020, the New York State Department of Health issued an advisory requiring the admission of patients to nursing homes who test positive for the coronavirus and barred testing prospective nursing home patients after the CDC announced that &quot;patients with COVID-19 could be discharged from a health care facility to both home and long-term care facilities when indicated.&quot; This was also in federal compliance with the HHS&#x27;s announcement that &quot;Nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present.&quot; Due to widespread misinformation in the press, Cuomo and his health commissioner, Howard Zucker, were wrongfully accused of being the origin of mandating nursing homes to accept patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from hospitals.

On May 10, Cuomo announced that New York would no longer require nursing homes to take COVID-19 patients from hospitals, stating that the change was not a policy reversal, but that hospitals would now be responsible for testing patients before they were released to nursing facilities. By then, as many as 4,500 COVID-19 infected patients had been sent to nursing homes in NY state which was said to have contributed to over 6,000 New York state nursing home residents dying of COVID-19 as of June 2020. However, in July 2020, the New York State Department of Health released a report that found: &quot;Peak nursing home admissions occurred a week after peak nursing home mortality, therefore illustrating that nursing home admissions from hospitals were not a driver of nursing home infections or fatalities&quot;; instead the department concluded that asymptomatic nursing home staff drove the infections. Cuomo reacted to this report by stating that attribution of nursing home deaths to his March 2020 policy had &quot;no basis in fact&quot;.

On January 28, 2021, an investigation conducted by state attorney general Letitia James concluded that the Cuomo administration undercounted COVID-19-related deaths at nursing homes by as much as 50%. James also reported that many nursing home residents died from COVID-19 in hospitals after being transferred from their nursing homes, which was not reflected in the DOH&#x27;s published total nursing home death data.

On February 12, 2021, Melissa DeRosa, a top aide to Cuomo, said in a call with state Democratic leaders that the Cuomo administration delayed the release of data pertaining to COVID-19 deaths from nursing home patients who died in hospitals while responding to an inquiry that former President Donald Trump had directed the Department of Justice to consider investigating. Critics voiced concerns about the probe being politically motivated as New York and three other democratic-led states were targeted by Trump, regarding the same matter. Calls to rescind Cuomo&#x27;s emergency powers, granted amidst the pandemic, were launched within the New York State Senate immediately following this report, with 14 Democrats joining the Republican minority in the effort. 
On February 17, 2021, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn announced they were investigating the incident. On July 23, 2021, the DOJ announced that they would not pursue an investigation into Cuomo&#x27;s handling of COVID-19-related deaths in state nursing homes, nor a possible cover up of nursing home deaths, as a result of no evidence of wrongdoing.

On March 19, 2021, the FBI reported that an investigation was underway on Governor Andrew Cuomo for improperly using the power of his office to shield nursing home executive political donors from COVID-19 lawsuits but declined to investigate further.

===Sexual harassment allegations and resignation===
On December 13, 2020, Lindsey Boylan, a former aide for Cuomo who was a Democratic candidate for Manhattan Borough president in 2021, alleged &quot;[Cuomo] sexually harassed me for years. Many saw it, and watched.&quot; Boylan further alleged that Cuomo &quot;exists without ethics&quot;, &quot;takes advantage of people, including me&quot; and ran a &quot;toxic team environment&quot;. A spokesperson for the Cuomo administration denied the accusation. Boylan further elaborated on her accusations in February 2021, claiming Cuomo goaded her to play strip poker with him while on a flight in 2017 and forcibly kissed her on the mouth in his Manhattan office. The governor&#x27;s office said Boylan&#x27;s claims were false.

On February 27, 2021, Charlotte Bennett, an executive assistant and health policy advisor of Cuomo, also accused him of sexual harassment, saying that he asked her about her sex life on several occasions in late Spring 2020 and if she had been in sexual relationships with older men. She also suggested that Cuomo was open to relationships with women &quot;above the age of 22&quot;. In a statement on February 27, Cuomo denied making advances to Bennett and acting inappropriately towards her.

In a February 28 statement, Cuomo said: &quot;I now understand that my interactions may have been insensitive or too personal and that some of my comments, given my position, made others feel in ways I never intended.&quot; He apologized and acknowledged &quot;some of the things I have said have been misinterpreted as an unwanted flirtation.&quot; He also said, &quot;At work sometimes I think I am being playful and make jokes that I think are funny. I mean no offense and only attempt to add some levity and banter to what is a very serious business.&quot;

The two U.S. senators for New York, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, both Democrats, called for an independent investigation. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a CNN interview that President Joe Biden supported an independent investigation into Governor Cuomo&#x27;s conduct.

On March 1, a third woman came forward alleging Cuomo had sexually harassed her and touched her without consent on her bare lower back while posing for a photograph. Anna Ruch was not on the governor&#x27;s staff, but encountered him socially at a wedding reception in September 2019. The attorney general of New York state, Letitia James, was reported to be investigating options for an independent investigation. When reporting the allegation, &quot;The New York Times&quot; also published a photograph from the event which showed Cuomo putting his hands on Ruch&#x27;s face. She said the incident made her feel &quot;uncomfortable and embarrassed&quot;.

A fourth woman, Ana Liss, came forward on March 6 and alleged Cuomo touched her inappropriately on her lower back and kissed her hand. That same day, Karen Hinton, a former consultant of Cuomo when he was leading the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, alleged that in 2000 he had asked personal questions and inappropriately hugged her in his hotel room.

On March 1, 2021, Cuomo&#x27;s senior counsel and special adviser Beth Garvey instructed New York attorney general Letitia James to proceed with an independent investigation of Cuomo. On March 8, James hired attorneys from two law firms (firstly Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton, and secondly Vladeck, Raskin &amp; Clark) to conduct an independent investigation of Cuomo.

On March 9, a sixth woman alleged that Cuomo inappropriately touched her at the governor&#x27;s mansion. On April 7, the unnamed aide said that after she had been summoned to governor&#x27;s mansion in November 2020, Cuomo allegedly rose from his desk and began groping her. After the aide told him it would get him in trouble, Cuomo then shut the door and said &quot;I don&#x27;t care.&quot; He then returned and groped one of her breasts over her bra by reaching under her blouse. A month later she claimed that Cuomo told her to cover-up what had occurred. On August 8, she revealed her identity: Brittany Commisso.

On March 11, 2021, the New York Assembly approved a separate impeachment investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations made against Cuomo.

On March 12, Kaitlin (last name unreported), who formerly worked for the governor&#x27;s office, alleged that Cuomo had made her feel uncomfortable in various situations, with his comments, questions, requests, and invasions of her personal space. She did not allege inappropriate touching or explicit sexual propositions. Also on March 12, journalist Jessica Bakeman alleged that Cuomo had sexually harassed her by touching her and making inappropriate comments. She wrote: &quot;I never thought the governor wanted to have sex with me. It wasn&#x27;t about sex. It was about power. He wanted me to know that I was powerless&quot;.

On March 18, another journalist, Valerie Bauman, came forward. She said that Cuomo had made her feel uncomfortable, describing him staring at her, entering her personal space, offering her a job, and asking personal questions. Bauman also stated that Cuomo &quot;never touched [her] inappropriately or said anything that [she] felt [she] could report to [her] boss&quot;. On March 19, Alyssa McGrath, who was still working for Cuomo&#x27;s office at the time, accused Cuomo of sexually harassing her by ogling her and making inappropriate comments. McGrath did not accuse Cuomo of inappropriate sexual contact. On March 29, Sherry Vill, a New York constituent whose flood-damaged house Cuomo had visited in May 2017, alleged that Cuomo had inappropriately kissed her twice on her cheek during that visit.

Attorney General James&#x27;s five-month investigation concluded with the release of a report on August 3, 2021. This report concluded that during Cuomo&#x27;s time in office, he sexually harassed 11 women: Boylan, Bennett, Ruch, Liss, Brittany Commisso, Kaitlin, McGrath, event attendee Virginia Limmiatis, an unnamed New York State trooper and two unnamed state entity employees. The investigation concluded that Cuomo&#x27;s behaviour included unwanted groping, kissing and sexual comments, and also found that Cuomo&#x27;s office had engaged in illegal retaliation against Boylan for her allegation against him.

Cuomo responded to the report with a denial: &quot;I never touched anyone inappropriately.&quot; The report generated public condemnation against the governor and heightened calls for him to resign. On August 3, President Joe Biden called upon Cuomo to resign. The release also prompted district attorneys for Manhattan, Nassau County, Westchester County, Albany County and Oswego County to pursue criminal investigations regarding his behavior.

Cuomo later filed a complaint with New York&#x27;s Supreme Court stating that James had publicly called him a &quot;serial sexual harasser&quot; and &quot;sick and pathetic,&quot; violating one of the ABA&#x27;s responsibilities of a prosecutor stating that, &quot;In the context of a criminal prosecution, a prosecutor&#x27;s extrajudicial statement can create the additional problem of increasing public condemnation of the accused,&quot; Cuomo said.

On August 10, 2021, despite denying all allegations of sexual harassment, Cuomo announced he would step down as Governor of New York, effective August 24.
 On August 21, Cuomo said that Hurricane Henri would not affect his resignation.

On October 28, 2021, a spokesman for the state court system announced that Cuomo would be charged with a misdemeanor sex crime in the Albany City Court. However, on January 4, 2022, Albany County District Attorney David Soares dropped a criminal complaint against Cuomo and also announced that Cuomo would not face any other charges related to other groping allegations, citing lack of evidence. Three days later, a judge dropped the criminal charge against Cuomo.

On December 23, 2021, Nassau county District Attorney Joyce Smith declined filing criminal charges.

On December 28, 2021, the Westchester County District Attorney declined to issue criminal charges, citing &quot;statutory requirements&quot; of New York.

On January 31, 2022, the fifth and final sexual misconduct case against Cuomo, made by Virginia Limmiatis, was dropped by Oswego district attorney Gregory Oakes, effectively clearing him of all charges.

On November 24, 2023, Commisso filed a lawsuit against Cuomo alleging sexual harassment under the New York Adult Survivors Act which extended the time period a victim could sue for sexual assault or harassment that had previously been beyond the statute of limitations. Commisso filed the lawsuit on the last day of the time limit to sue, with the window expiring at midnight on the 24th. The lawsuit alleges a number of inappropriate interactions and actions by Cuomo, and that Commisso hadn&#x27;t come forward in fear of retaliation; which the suit claims did happen and that then-Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul demoted her to menial tasks in lower offices. Cuomo&#x27;s attorney responded claiming that Commisso&#x27;s claims were false and an attempt at a &quot;cash grab&quot;.

== Post-gubernatorial career ==
Cuomo filed for a state retirement pension, to be effective September 1, 2021, based on 14.56 years of state service as attorney general and governor.

On March 3, 2022, during Cuomo&#x27;s first public appearance since his resignation, he gave a speech at the God&#x27;s Battalion of Prayer church in Brooklyn and came out against cancel culture and hinted at a political comeback. Cuomo said, &quot;The press roasted me, my colleagues were ridiculed, my brother was fired. It was ugly. It was probably the toughest time of my life.&quot; In the speech before an ally&#x27;s church, he said, &quot;Contrary to what my political opponents would have you believe, nothing I did violated the law or the regulation.&quot;

On March 14, 2022, at an event to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Cuomo came out stating his plans to create an organization that will be called &quot;Progressives for Israel&quot;. As part of his justification for this organization, he stated &quot;You cannot denounce antisemitism but waver on Israel&#x27;s right to exist and defend itself but it should be non-Jewish officials who speak first and loudest&quot;. Cuomo later declared &quot;I am going to call the question for Democrats &#x27;Do you stand with Israel or do you stand against Israel? This came amidst speculation that Cuomo intended to run in the 2024 United States Senate election in New York.

In February 2023, Andrew Cuomo criticized President Biden over the problems stemming from the Mexican border and migrants being displaced within the United States.

Cuomo has been frequently rumored to run as a candidate in the 2025 New York City mayoral election.

==Electoral history==
== Personal life ==

Cuomo married Kerry Kennedy, the seventh child of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel Kennedy, on June 9, 1990. They have three daughters: twins, Cara Ethel Kennedy-Cuomo and Mariah Matilda Kennedy-Cuomo (born 1995), and Michaela Andrea Kennedy-Cuomo (born 1997). They separated in 2003, and divorced in 2005.

Cuomo began dating Food Network host Sandra Lee in 2005, and the couple moved in together in 2011. The two resided in Westchester County, New York. On September 25, 2019, the couple announced that they had ended their relationship. From the fall of 2019 until August 21, 2021, Cuomo lived in the New York State Executive Mansion on a full-time basis with his three daughters.

On July 4, 2015, Cuomo presided over the wedding ceremony of his longtime friend Billy Joel to his fourth wife, Alexis Roderick.

Cuomo is Catholic. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Cuomo&#x27;s positions in favor of abortion rights and same-sex marriage (and his cohabitation with Lee without marrying her) have &quot;become a lightning rod in a decades-old culture war between conservative Catholics and those, like Mr. Cuomo, who disagree with the church&#x27;s positions on various issues, including abortion and divorce&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cuomo became known by the nickname of the &quot;Love Gov&quot; after answering a question by his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, about showing his softer tone while leading coronavirus response efforts. The governor responded with, &quot;I&#x27;ve always been a soft guy. I am the love gov. I&#x27;m a cool dude in a loose mood, you know that. I just say, &#x27;Let it go, just go with the flow, baby.&#x27; You know. You can&#x27;t control anything, so don&#x27;t even try.&quot;

Cuomo drives a 1968 Pontiac GTO with the New York license plate of number &quot;1&quot;.

<text>Ristretto (), known in full in Italian as caffè ristretto, is a &quot;short shot&quot; ( from a double basket) of a highly concentrated espresso coffee. It is made with the same amount of ground coffee, but extracted (also in from 20 to 30 seconds) using half as much water. A normal short shot might look like a ristretto, but in reality, would only be a weaker, more diluted, shot. The opposite of a &quot;ristretto&quot; (Italian for &#x27;shortened, narrow&#x27;) is a lungo (&#x27;long&#x27;), which has double the amount of water. In France a ristretto is called &quot;café serré&quot;.

Regardless of whether one uses a hand pressed machine or an automatic, a regular double shot is generally considered to be around of ground coffee extracted into about 40 ml (2 fl oz; two shot glasses). Thus, a &quot;double ristretto&quot; consumes the same amount of coffee beans but fills only a single shot glass.

Coffee contains over a thousand aromatic compounds. A ristretto&#x27;s chemical composition and taste differ from those of a full-length extraction for three reasons:

# More concentrated: the first part of any extraction is the most concentrated, its color typically lying between dark chocolate and umber, whereas the tail end of shots are much lighter, varying from the color of dark pumpkin pie to varying shades of tan (see photo, above right). This is an important factor when drinking straight espresso shots.
# Different balance: different chemical compounds in ground coffee dissolve into hot water at different rates. A ristretto contains a greater relative proportion of faster extracting compounds, proportionally fewer of the compounds characteristic of over-extraction, and thus, a different balance.
# Fewer total extracts: relative proportions aside, fewer total coffee compounds—caffeine being just one—are extracted into ristrettos versus full length shots. This is an important factor when diluting shots into water or milk.

Straight ristrettos—shots that are traditionally drunk from a demitasse and not diluted into a larger cup containing milk or water—could be described as bolder, fuller, with more body and less bitterness. These characteristics are usually attributed to espresso in general but are more pronounced in a ristretto. Diluted into a cup of water (e.g., americano or long black) or milk (e.g., latte or cappuccino), ristrettos are less bitter and exhibit a more intense espresso character.

<text>A blender (sometimes called a mixer or liquidiser in British English) is a kitchen and laboratory appliance used to mix, crush, purée or emulsify food and other substances. A stationary blender consists of a blender container with a rotating metal or plastic blade at the bottom, powered by an electric motor that is in the base. Some powerful models can also crush ice and other frozen foods. The newer immersion blender configuration has a motor on top connected by a shaft to a rotating blade at the bottom, which can be used with any container.

==Characteristics==
Different blenders have different functions and features but product testing indicates that many blenders, even the less expensive ones, are useful for meeting many consumer needs. Features which consumers consider when purchasing a blender include the following:
*large visible measurement marks
*ease of use
*low noise during usage
*power usage (typically 300–1000 watts)
*ease of cleaning
*option for quick &quot;pulse&quot; blending

===Countertop blenders===
Countertop blenders use a 1–2 liters (4–8 cups) blending container made of glass, plastic, stainless steel. Glass blenders are heavier and more stable. Plastic is prone to scratching and absorbing the smell of blended food. Stainless steel is preferred for its appearance, but limits visibility of the food as it is blended.

Countertop blenders typically offer 2–16 speed settings, but having more choices in speed settings is not an indication of increased utility for all users.

In cases where the blades are removable, the container should have an O-ring or gasket between the body of the container and the base to seal the container and prevent the contents from leaking. The blending container is generally shaped in a way that encourages material to circulate through the blades, rather than simply spinning around.

The container rests upon a base that contains a motor for turning the blade assembly and has controls on its surface. Most modern blenders offer a number of possible speeds. Low-powered blenders require the addition of some liquid to operate correctly. In these blenders, the liquid helps move the solids around the jar, bringing them in contact with the blades. The blades create a whirlpool effect which moves solids from top to bottom, ensuring even contact with the blade. This creates a homogeneous mixture. High-powered blenders are capable of milling grains and crushing ice without such assistance.

===Immersion blenders===
The hand-held immersion blender, stick blender, hand blender or wand blender has no container of its own, but instead has a mixing head with rotating blades that can be immersed in a container. Immersion blenders are convenient for homogenizing volumes that are too large to fit in the bowl of a stationary blender or as in the case of soups, are too hot to be safely poured into the bowl.

The operation of an immersion blender requires that the user hold down a switch for as long as the blades operate, which can be tiresome for the user.

Handheld blenders are particularly used for small and specific tasks but do not have as many uses as a countertop blender.

== Applications ==
Countertop blenders are designed to mix, purée, and chop food. Their strength is such that the ability to crush ice is an expected feature.

Blenders are used both in home and commercial kitchens for various purposes, including to:
* Grind semi-solid ingredients, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, into smooth purées
* Blend ice cream, milk, and sweet sauces to make milkshakes
* Mix and crush ice in cocktails such as the Zombie, piña colada and frozen margarita
* Crush ice and other ingredients in non-alcoholic drinks such as frappuccinos and smoothies
* Emulsify mixtures
* Reduce small solids such as spices and seeds to smaller solids or completely powder or nut butter
* Blend mixtures of powders, granules, and/or liquids thoroughly
* Help dissolve solids into liquids

Blenders also have a variety of applications in microbiology and food science. In addition to standard food-type blenders, there are a variety of other configurations made for laboratories.

== Development ==

=== North America ===
The Polish-American chemist Stephen Poplawski, the owner of the Stevens Electric Company, began designing drink mixers in 1919 under a contract with Arnold Electric Company, and patented the drink mixer in 1922 which had been designed to make Horlicks malted milkshakes at soda fountains. He also introduced the liquefier blender in 1922.

In the 1930s, Louis Hamilton, Chester Beach and Fred Osius produced Poplawski&#x27;s invention under the brand name Hamilton Beach Company. Fred Osius improved the appliance, making another kind of blender. He approached Fred Waring, a popular musician, who financed and promoted the &quot;Miracle Mixer&quot;, released in 1933. However, the appliance had some problems to be solved about the seal of the jar and the knife axis, so Fred Waring redesigned the appliance and released his own blender in 1937, the &quot;Waring Blendor&quot; with which Waring popularized the smoothie in the 1940s. Waring Products was sold to Dynamics Corporation of America in 1957 and was acquired by Conair in 1998. Waring long used the trademarked spelling &quot;Blendor&quot; for its product; the trademark has expired.

Also in 1937, W.G. Barnard, founder of Vitamix, introduced a product called &quot;The Blender,&quot; which was functionally a reinforced blender with a stainless steel jar, instead of the Pyrex glass jar used by Waring.

In 1946 John Oster, owner of the Oster barber equipment company, bought Stevens Electric Co. and designed its own blender, which Oster commercialized under the trademark &quot;Osterizer&quot;. Oster was bought by Sunbeam Products in 1960. which released various types of blenders, such as the Imperial series, and still make the traditional &quot;Osterizer&quot; blender.

=== Europe ===

In Europe, the Swiss Traugott Oertli developed a blender based on the technical construction and design style conception of the first Waring Blendor (1937–1942), releasing in 1943 the &quot;Turmix Standmixer&quot;. Based on the blender, Traugott also developed another kind of appliance to extract juice of any juicy fruit or vegetables, the &quot;Turmix Juicer&quot;, which was also available as separated accessory for use in the Turmix blender, the juicer &quot;Turmix Junior&quot;. had promoted the benefits of drinking natural juices made with fruits and vegetables, with recipes using juices to promote its blender and juicer. After the World War II other companies released more blender in Europe; the first one was the popular Starmix Standmixer (1948), from the Germany company Electrostar, which had numerous accessories, like a coffee grinder, cake mixer, ice cream maker, food processor, thermic jar, milk centrifugue, juicer and meat grinder; and the Braun Multimix (1950) from Max Braun, which had an attachment with glass bowl to make batter bread and a juicer centrifuge like the one developed by Turmix.

=== South America ===
In Brazil, Waldemar Clemente, ex-staffer of General Electric and owner of Walita electric appliance company since 1939, designed a blender based on the Turmix Standmixer and released in 1944 the &quot;Walita Neutron&quot; blender. Clemente also created the name &quot;liquidificador&quot;, which ever since designated a blender in Brazil. Soon thereafter, Walita acquired the Turmix patents in Brazil and also released the Turmix juicer, calling it the &quot;Centrífuga Walita&quot; as well the others Turmix accessories for use with the blender motor, as fruit peelers, grinder, crusher and batter mixer. Using the same marketing strategy as Turmix in Europe, Walita passed the million-blenders-sold mark a few years later in the early 1950s. Walita was the first manufacturer to release a wide range of blenders in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Walita made blenders for Siemens, Turmix, Philips, and Sears (Kenmore), among others. In the 1960s Royal Philips Co. approached Walita, acquiring the company in 1971, becoming Royal Philips&#x27; kitchen appliances developer division specializing in blenders, which are sold under the Philips brand outside Brazil.

The Austrian immigrant Hanz Arno, owner of an electric motor manufacturer in Brazil since the 1940s, released a blender in 1947, based on the blenders made by Hamilton Beach and Oster. The &quot;Liquidificador Arno&quot; was exported to other South American countries. As Arno had stocks of Electrolux, that brand was used on the blender in some countries. Later in 1997 Arno was bought by the Groupe SEB, owner of Moulinex, T-Fal, Rowenta, and other home appliance brands.

=== Increased versatility ===
With the rising popularity of smoothies, Frappucinos and other frozen drinks prepared in front of the customer, new models of commercial blenders often include a sound-reducing enclosures and computerized controls.

Specialized blenders for making smoothies are becoming popular, chiefly resembling an ordinary model with a spigot added for quick serving. Some models also feature a gimballed stirring rod mounted on the lid, constructed so that mixtures can be stirred whilst the machine is running with no chance of the stirrer fouling the blades.

In 1996 Tom Dickson, founder and CEO of Blendtec, introduced the WildSide blending jar—a unique design that eliminated the need for stir sticks and plungers to make thicker blends. The technology was so effective that Vita-Mix decided to use the design in the company&#x27;s commercial blending containers. In 2010 the United States court system concluded that Vita-Mix had willfully infringed the patents, ultimately awarding Blendtec $24 million in damages.

== Mechanical operation ==
A blender consists of a housing, motor, blades, and food container. A fan-cooled electric motor is secured into the housing by way of vibration dampers, and a small output shaft penetrates the upper housing and meshes with the blade assembly. Usually, a small rubber washer provides a seal around the output shaft to prevent liquid from entering the motor. Most blenders today have multiple speeds. As a typical blender has no gearbox, the multiple speeds are often implemented using a universal motor with multiple stator windings and/or multi-tapped stator windings; in a blender with electromechanical controls, the button (or other electrical switching device or position) for each different speed connects a different stator winding/tap or combination thereof. Each different combination of energized windings produces a different torque from the motor, which yields a different equilibrium speed in balance against the drag (resistance to rotation) of the blade assembly in contact with the material inside the food container. A notable exception from the mid-1960s is the Oster Model 412 Classic VIII (with the single knob) providing the lowest speed (Stir) using the aforementioned winding tap method but furnishing higher speeds (the &quot;continuously variable&quot; higher speed range is marked Puree to Liquify) by means of a mechanical speed governor that balances the force provided by flyweights against a spring force varied by the control knob when it is switched into the higher speed range. 

==In culture==
In 1949 the company Vitamix advertised their blender in one of the first television infomercials. The sales pitch lasted for 25 minutes, suggesting that the blender be used to make bread crumbs, potato pancakes, laxative spinach drinks, and a dessert beverage featuring entire raw eggs and their shells, which the host announced would be enjoyed like malted milk.

<text>Hartmut Pilch (born 7 July 1963) is a German digital rights and far-right political activist, who works as a software developer and translator. He is notable for establishing the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII) in 1999. He was among the original leaders of the local Pegida movement in Munich in 2015–2016.

==Activities==
===Digital rights activism===
He took the lead in launching the FFII in Munich in February 1999, in response to the joint efforts of the European Commission and the European Patent Office (EPO) to liberalise patent law and facilitate software patenting in the European Union (EU). Prior to that he worked for the EPO in Munich.

In June 1999, acting on behalf of FFII, he co-founded the Eurolinux Alliance with Jean-Paul Smets of the Association francophone des utilisateurs de logiciels libres (AFUL). FFII then became a member organisation of the Eurolinux Alliance.

As president of the FFII, an organization that promotes software patent reform and digital freedom of speech, he oversaw an intense lobbying period aimed at EU agencies between 2000 and 2005. In late 2000, Eurolinux mobilised a collective response to the EU consultation on proposed changes to patent law.

In 2000, he led a campaign aimed to prevent the removal of the exclusion of computer programs as such from patenting in Art. 52(2) of the European Patent Convention. In 2003, he led again a campaign against the patentability of software in Europe. On 4 April 2003, he and Alexandre Dulaunoy of the Association Electronique Libre submitted a petition against software patenting with 140,000 signatures to the European Parliament (EP). Along with the support of an extensive grassroots network, he lobbied and convinced the EP members to amend a directive proposal on the Patentability of Computer-Implemented Inventions (initially written by the European Commission). He built an extensive network of individual contacts also outside the FFII, and had a direct connection to the Greens–European Free Alliance Group, the European People&#x27;s Party – European Democrats (EPP-ED) Group and the Party of European Socialists in the EP. He also voiced strong opposition to EPO practices regarding software patents.

In November 2005, at the General Assembly of the FFII e. V., Pilch stepped aside as president of the FFII, and Pieter Hintjens, CEO of iMatix, was elected as his successor. Pilch continued on the board of FFII as its vice-president and then (as of 2013) treasurer.

===Pegida activism===

In 2014 or 2015, he was involved in organising Pegida in Munich together with Heinz Meyer, who became its leader, and Stefan Werner. He took up a role as the movement&#x27;s spokesperson and &quot;leading intellectual&quot;. He addressed several Pegida rallies in Munich, including one on 7 September 2015 alongside Tatjana Festerling, where he criticised &quot;Juncker’s and Merkel’s human rights dogmatism&quot; and argued that the 2015 European migrant crisis was beyond Europe&#x27;s responsibility. 

In May 2016, he and Werner were expelled by Meyer from Pegida&#x27;s steering committee in Munich for organising a local twenty-strong solidarity demonstration in support of Alternative for Germany, which Meyer branded &quot;superfluous&quot;, and the Bavarian website of Pegida was taken over by the Dresden headquarters of the party. At that time, his other close associate in Pegida&#x27;s Bavarian structures was Susanne Helfenbein of the Freedom Party of Austria.

==Work==
He is a former employee of SuSE.

Pilch&#x27;s work as a translator focuses primarily on Chinese and Japanese. He is also a student of Lojban, a constructed language, and has worked as an interpreter.

==Personal life==
He is married to Wang Tao, they have three children. He resided in Munich as of 2006.

<text>Auryn (; stylized as AURYN) was a 5-member British-Spanish boy band founded in 2009. Signed to Warner Music, they sang in English and Spanish.

Various members of the band have taken part at different occasions in contests like &quot;Factor X&quot;, &quot;Veo Veo&quot;, &quot;La Batalla de los Coros&quot; and at Junior Eurovision Song Contest qualifications. Dani Fernández represented Spain in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2006.

==&quot;Destino Eurovisión 2011&quot;==

Auryn gained great popularity particularly after they took part in &quot;Destino Eurovisión&quot;, the selection process to represent Spain in Eurovision Song Contest 2011 reaching the final 3. In Heat 1 held on 28 January 2011, where contestants needed to perform an earlier Eurovision song, they sang a cover of &quot;Fly on the Wings of Love&quot; from the Olsen Brothers (the Eurovision 2000 winner for Denmark). They qualified to the next round by televoting. In the semi-final round held on 11 February 2011, contestants had to pick another Eurovision classic, they sang &quot;Eres tú&quot; originally by Mocedades that finished runner-up in Eurovision 1973 for Spain. They qualified by a decision of the jury to the Finals where they were one of the Top 3, the other acts being Lucía Pérez and Melissa. Each act had to sing three original songs, with the jury picking one original song from each artist. Auryn sang &quot;Evangeline&quot;, &quot;El sol brillará&quot; and &quot;Volver&quot;. The latter was picked as their final song. Eventually, the Spanish qualifying entry for Eurovision 2011 went to Lucía Pérez and her song &quot;Que me quiten lo bailao&quot;.

==Career==
When the band was formed in 2009, they first gained attention through their online postings on YouTube including covers for Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Umbrella&quot; and Los Secretos&#x27; &quot;Déjame&quot;. That was followed by an appearance on &quot;Destino Eurovisión 2011&quot; (see above) where they finished in the Final 3, but failed to qualify for Eurovision 2011.

Based on the popularity they achieved, the band released their first single &quot;Breathe in the Light&quot; later in 2011 as well as their debut album &quot;Endless Road 7058&quot; in 2012 both reaching the top 10 of the singles and album chart respectively. It won the &quot;Best New Album&quot; award at Televisión Española (TVE). Also spawning three top 10 singles, their follow-up album is &quot;Anti-Heroes&quot; was released in 2013 and went straight to number one on the album chart and has been certified platinum. Their third album &quot;Circus Avenue&quot; was preceded by the group&#x27;s first number one single &quot;Puppeteer&quot; and reached number one on the album chart where it stayed for 5 consecutive weeks. The group released their fourth album &quot;Ghost Town&quot; in December 2015, seven months before going on hiatus.

==Origin of the name==
The band&#x27;s name refers to the fictional talisman AURYN from Michael Ende book &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;, being two mythological serpents, symmetrical, that bite at each other&#x27;s tails. The charm of royal protection, when worn by a human, gives the wearer the power to fulfill all his wishes. Since the original word AURYN always appears in the book in all capitals, the band insists on naming its album titles in all capitals as well.

==Solo projects==
As the band went into hiatus in 2016, various members of the band launched solo projects. Blas Cantó signed to Warner Music Spain and released his debut solo single &quot;In Your Bed&quot;. They officially announced the breakup on 28 July 2016.

<text>The pals battalions of World War I were specially constituted battalions of the British Army comprising men who enlisted together in local recruiting drives, with the promise that they would be able to serve alongside their friends, neighbours and colleagues, rather than being arbitrarily allocated to battalions.

==Establishment==
At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, believed that overwhelming manpower was the key to winning the war, and set about looking for ways to encourage men of all classes to join. This initiative was in direct contrast to the British military tradition of employing long serving professional soldiers drawn from the gentry (for officers) or the lower classes (for enlisted men). General Sir Henry Rawlinson suggested that men would be more inclined to enlist if they knew that they were going to serve alongside their friends and colleagues. He appealed to London stockbrokers to raise a battalion of men from workers in the City of London to set an example. Sixteen hundred men enlisted in this 10th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, the so-called &quot;Stockbrokers&#x27; Battalion&quot;, within a week in late August 1914. 
A few days later, the Earl of Derby decided to raise a battalion of men from Liverpool. Within two days, 1,500 Liverpudlians joined the new battalion. Speaking to these men Lord Derby said: &quot;This should be a battalion of pals, a battalion in which friends from the same office will fight shoulder to shoulder for the honour of Britain and the credit of Liverpool.&quot; Within the next few days, three more battalions were raised in Liverpool, forming the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th Battalions of the King&#x27;s Regiment (Liverpool).

Encouraged by Lord Derby&#x27;s success, Kitchener promoted the idea of organising similar recruitment campaigns across the UK. By the end of September 1914, more than fifty towns had formed pals battalions. Larger towns and cities were able to form several battalions each; Manchester, for example, raised four battalions in August, and four more in November. From the perspective of the War Office, the pals battalion experiment relieved the heavy strain on the recruiting structure of a suddenly expanded regular army as well as easing the financial strain. In September 1914 Kitchener announced that the organizers of locally raised units would have to meet the initial accommodation and other costs involved, until the War Office took over their management. Accordingly, many recruits for the new pals battalions were initially able to live at home while reporting for daily basic training.

==Examples==
The &quot;Grimsby Chums&quot; was formed by former schoolboys of Wintringham Secondary School in Grimsby. Many other schools, including some of the leading public schools, also formed battalions. Several sportsmen&#x27;s battalions were formed, including three battalions of footballers: 17th and 23rd (Service) Battalions, Middlesex Regiment, and 16th (2nd Edinburgh) (Service) Battalion, Royal Scots, the last-mentioned battalion containing the entire first and reserve team players, several boardroom and staff members, and a sizable contingent of supporters of Scottish professional club Heart of Midlothian F.C. Out of nearly 1,000 battalions raised during the first two years of the war, 145 Service and seventy Reserve infantry units were locally raised pals battalions. Some pals battalions were trade/social-background linked rather than area linked, such as artists&#x27; battalions and sportsmen&#x27;s battalions. Professional golfers Albert Tingey, Sr., Charles Mayo, and James Bradbeer joined pals battalions.

The 17th and 32nd Battalions, Northumberland Fusiliers were almost entirely created from the ranks of the North Eastern Railway. For members who joined the battalions, the North Eastern Railway gave some offers including; provisions for wives and dependants; to keep men&#x27;s positions open; to pay their contribution to the Superannuation and Pensions and to provide accommodation for the families who were occupying company houses.

==Roles==
While the majority of pals units were infantry battalions, local initiatives resulted in the raising of forty-eight companies of engineers, forty-two batteries of field artillery and eleven ammunition columns, drawn mainly from groups with common occupational backgrounds. The relatively high skills and educational levels of many pals battalions meant an outflow of potential officers for commissioning elsewhere, from 1915 on.

==Casualties==

Many of these locally raised battalions suffered heavy casualties during the Somme offensives of 1916. A notable example was the 11th (Service) Battalion (Accrington), East Lancashire Regiment, better known as the Accrington Pals. The Accrington Pals were ordered to attack Serre, the most northerly part of the main assault, on the opening day of the battle. The Accrington Pals were accompanied by pals battalions drawn from Sheffield, Leeds, Barnsley, and Bradford. Of an estimated 700 Accrington Pals who took part in the attack, 235 were killed and 350 wounded within the space of twenty minutes. Despite repeated attempts, Serre was not taken until February 1917, at which time the German Army had evacuated to the Hindenburg Line.

==Termination of regional or group recruiting==
The Battle of the Somme marked a turning point in the pals battalion experiment. Many were disbanded or amalgamated after the scheme effectively came to an end following the summer of 1916. Others retained their titles until the end of the war but with recruitment dependent upon drafts from a common pool of conscripts rather than from those with regional or other common ties.

The practice of drawing recruits from a particular region or group meant that, when a pals battalion suffered heavy casualties, the impact on individual towns, villages, neighbourhoods and communities back in Britain could be immediate and devastating. As an example, The Sheffield City Battalion (12th York and Lancaster Regiment) lost 495 dead and wounded in one day (1 July 1916) on the Somme and was brought back to strength by October that year only by drafts from diverse areas.

With the introduction of conscription in March 1916, further pals battalions were not sought. Voluntary local recruitment outside the regular army structure, and although characteristic of the atmosphere of 1914–15, was not repeated in World War II.

<text>Winston Baldwin Spencer (born 8 October 1948) is an Antiguan politician who was the third prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda from 2004 to 2014.

Spencer led the opposition United Progressive Party (UPP) to victory in the March 2004 parliamentary election. In addition to serving as prime minister, he became minister of foreign affairs on 6 January 2005.

Spencer&#x27;s party was swept from power in the June 2014 general election.

==Political career==
===Leader of the Opposition===

Baldwin Spencer is rooted in labour. For a quarter-century, he was a prominent labour leader with the Antigua and Barbuda Workers Union. He was first elected to Parliament in 1989 as the MP for the St. John&#x27;s Rural West constituency.

In 1992, Spencer played an integral role in the formation of the United Progressive Party. He previously served as a leader with the United National Democratic Party and spearheaded collaborative meetings with the Antigua Caribbean Liberation Movement that resulted in the formation of the United Progressive Party. Upon formation of the party, Spencer rose to become the political leader of the party and the Opposition Leader in the Parliament.

As Opposition Leader Baldwin Spencer organized public demonstrations and went on a hunger strike to advocate for electoral reform after the widely criticized 1999 elections. His advocacy led to the formation of an independent Electoral Commission to oversee elections in Antigua and Barbuda. He also led the fight to ensure that opposition had access to state-owned media, such as the television station, Antigua Broadcasting Service (ABS). To that end, he filed a writ and took the Bird Government to court arguing that, in a democratic society, citizens have a right to hear an opposing political perspective on government airwaves.

===Prime minister===

In 2004, Baldwin Spencer led the United Progressive Party to a landslide victory in the general election. He defeated Lester Bird&#x27;s ALP, which had ruled Antigua and Barbuda for the previous 28 years. In Government he moved to enact a trio of good government reforms: a nationwide school meals programme, raising the minimum wage and paying all civil servants.

Internationally Baldwin Spencer is known as a skilled diplomat who helped his country assume the leadership of the Group of 77 in 2008. He received the highest order of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, the Commander of the National Order. He was also recognized by the United Nations for his leadership, receiving the Millennium Development Goals Achievement Award in recognition for his work advancing the cause of international development.

The UPP won the March 2009 election with a reduced majority of nine out of 17 seats. Spencer himself defeated ALP candidate Gail Christian in the St John&#x27;s Rural West constituency, receiving 2,259 votes against 1,753 for Christian. Spencer said on this occasion that it would &quot;not be business as usual&quot;, and he was promptly sworn in for another term as prime minister when vote counting was completed.

After 10 years in power, the UPP was defeated by the ALP in the general election held on 12 June 2014. Out of 17 seats, the UPP retained only three; Spencer won re-election to his own seat by a very narrow margin. Spencer accepted defeat, saying that the people had clearly chosen the ALP. He was succeeded as prime minister by ALP leader Gaston Browne on 13 June.

==Personal life==

Spencer is married to Jacklyn Spencer and is the father of two children. On 16 August 2008, Spencer was inducted as an honorary member of the Pathfinder Club, a Seventh-day Adventist youth service organization, during a gathering of more than 3,000 Pathfinders from around the Caribbean.

On 19 February 2022, Spencer was involved in a car accident close to the Townhouse Megastore in St. John&#x27;s, but was reported to be unhurt.

On 3 July 2023, Spencer was fined ECD 500 for court’s contempt by Judge Jan Drysdale after his cell phone rang during the election court challenge against Kelvin Simon regarding his nomination as a UPP candidate for the general elections in January 2023.

<text>The T-52 Enryu is a rescue robot.

A rescue robot is a robot that is made to help the humans in areas that have been hit by a natural disaster such as an earthquake, tsunami, etc., or by a man-made disaster such as fires, car crashes, etc. There are many different types of rescue robots of different sizes and shapes. The , sometimes referred to as &quot;HyperRescueRobot&quot;, is a hydraulically operated robot, built to cut a path through debris for rescue workers, in the wake of an earthquake or other catastrophe.

As of 2006, the robot conducted a performance test at Nagaoka University of Technology and successfully lifted a car from a snowbank.

TMSUK developed the robot in cooperation with Kyoto University, the Kitakyushu Fire Department and Japan&#x27;s National Research Institute of Fire and Disaster in Tokyo. The 3.5-metre-tall robot can either be driven from a cockpit positioned at the front of the robot or it can be controlled remotely as like its cousin the Banryu, it contains multiple CCD cameras which transmit to the remote driver - in this case, it has seven 6.8-megapixel CCD cams mounted on its &quot;head&quot;, &quot;torso&quot; and &quot;arms&quot;.

== Characteristics of T-52 Enryu ==
T-52 Enryu measures 3.5 meters in height, 2.4 meters in width, and weighs 5 tons. It has two 6-meter arms. Each arm could carry 500 kilograms and both arms combined can lift up to one ton. The robot runs on diesel fuel. It has a top speed of 3 km/h which is equivalent to most construction machines.
The robot does not have a program installed in it, need to be taught how to operate, or has any sensors to help it see because the human controls it. It does have a camera to help the human see where it is going when the human is using a remote to control it.

== History ==
T-52 Enryu was created by the TMSUK company in Munakata-City, Fukuoka, Japan. Founded in 2000, TMSUK has 20 employees.

The T-52 was created in 2004. The urge to build such advanced rescue robots begun after experts realized the amount of damage natural disasters did in the past decade alone. According to the Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) there was 3852 disasters in the last decade in which over three quarters of a million of people died, and cost an amount $960 billion to fix damaged buildings and help people pay their hospital bills.

== Operation ==
There is two methods to operate the T-52 Enryu: Operator sitting inside the robot and by remote control device.
In the first method, the driver has to climb inside the robot and manually control it just like if it was a construction machine. The downside of this method is that in some cases, it is too dangerous for a person to be inside the robot because other building could collapse onto the robot and smash it, or in case of a car crash, there could be the risk of explosions.
The second method is using a control remote to direct T-52 Enryu. When it comes to controlling the robot with the remote control device there is two options:

# Master-slave control: This method directly transmits the moves of the human to the machine from a control center which gives the machine a more human-like motion. Since the operator does not have to be inside the robot to control it, this method is very efficient when there is danger of further collapse in the damaged area.

# Joystick control: This method is used when a more precise motion is needed. This method allows the control of single joints of the robot making it more precise than that of master-slave control.

== T-52 Enryu in action ==
The T-52 Enryu is used to lift heavy objects in areas damaged due to a natural disaster or car crashes. It can cut through metals and other materials to free people who are trapped. Also it helps clear the road for other vehicles to pass through. Last, T-52 Enryu can rip doors from cars to allow people to exit. It is mostly used in areas where it might be too dangerous for people to go to.

<text>In film and television, production designer is the individual responsible for the overall aesthetic of the story. The production design gives the viewers a sense of the time period, the plot location, and character actions and feelings. Working directly with the director, cinematographer, and producer, production designers have a key creative role in the creation of motion pictures and television. The term &quot;production designer&quot; was coined by William Cameron Menzies while he was working on the film &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Production designers are commonly confused with &quot;art directors&quot; as the roles have similar responsibilities. Production designers decide the visual concept and deal with the many and varied logistics of filmmaking including, schedules, budgets, and staffing. Art directors manage the process of making the visuals, which is done by concept artists, graphic designers, set designers, costume designers, lighting designers, etc. The production designer and the art director lead a team of individuals to assist with the visual component of the film. Depending on the size of the production the rest of the team can include runners, graphic designers, drafts people, props makers, and set builders. Productions Designers create a framework for the visual aesthetic of a project and work in partnership and collaboration with the Set Decorator &amp; Set Decorating department to execute the desired look. 

== Process ==

# The production designer will read the script and allocate categories based on the required visual components such as interior, exterior, location, graphic, vehicles, etc. Discussion with the director is essential in the beginning of the production design process. In this discussion, the production designer will clarify the approach and focus required for the visual design of each scene. 
# The production designer will move to researching which is important in every design process. They will use mood board which consists of images, sketches, inspiration, color swatches, photos, textiles, etc. that help with the ideation. Learning about the time period, the place and the culture also assists with coming up with an idea. Moreover, the PD has to plan to create a convincing space within a budget, therefore, it is important that the space can speak about the character or enhance the flow of the story, rather than being filled with unnecessary decoration. Additionally, it also affects the location of filming, whether it is in a studio or at a specific location. 
# The production designer will ensure that 

== The importance of production design ==

Production design plays an essential role in storytelling, for instance, in the movie &quot;Titanic&quot;, when the characters Jack and Rose are in the cold water after the ship sank, we know that they are cold because of the setting: it is nighttime and there is ice on their hair. A more specific example is &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, in which we know the story takes place on a farm because of the bale of hay Dorothy leans on and the animals around, as well as the typical wooden fence. In the scene in which Dorothy&#x27;s dog is taken away, we know that it happens in her aunt and uncle&#x27;s house, which adds more tension because her beloved friend, Toto is not killed, lost or kidnapped on the street, but is forced to leave by an outsider, Ms. Gulch, who enters Dorothy&#x27;s private and safe zone (her home). Jane Barnwell states that the place the characters exist in gives information about them and enhances the fluency of the narrative (175). Imagine Dorothy&#x27;s home was dirty and everyone in her house were dressed untidily, the viewer would have supported the outsider instead, perhaps thinking that the outsider in a way, rescued the dog from an unhealthy environment. Additionally, the characters&#x27; clothing, especially that of Ms. Gulch, makes the description &quot;own half the county&quot; more reliable in portraying Ms. Gulch, and also supports the reason why Dorothy cannot rebel against Ms. Gulch by making the dog stay. However, this does not mean that the setting or costume should be extremely detailed and cluttered with information. The goal is to not let the viewer notice these elements, which, however, is how production design works. Jon Boorstin states in his book, &quot;Making Movies Work Thinking Like a Filmmaker&quot;, that the background, the camera motion or even the sound effect is considered well-done if the viewer does not notice their appearance.

== Societies and trade organizations ==
In the United States and British Columbia, production designers are represented by several local unions of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE). Local 800, the Art Directors Guild, represents production designers in the U.S., with the exception of New York City and its vicinity. Those members are represented by Local 829, the United Scenic Artists. In the rest of Canada, production designers are represented by the Directors Guild of Canada. In the United Kingdom, members of the art department are represented by the non-union British Film Designers Guild.

The production design credit must be requested by a film&#x27;s producer, prior to completion of photography, and submitted to the Art Directors Guild Board of Directors for the credit approval.

<doc id="555554" wikidata="Q208094" url="?curid=555554" title="Peer Gynt">
<text>Peer Gynt (, ) is a five-act play in verse written in 1867 by the Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen. It is one of Ibsen&#x27;s best known and most widely performed plays.

&quot;Peer Gynt&quot; chronicles the journey of its title character from the Norwegian mountains to the North African desert and back. According to Klaus Van Den Berg, &quot;its origins are Romantic, but the play also anticipates the fragmentations of emerging modernism&quot; and the &quot;cinematic script blends poetry with social satire and realistic scenes with surreal ones.&quot; &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; has also been described as the story of a life based on procrastination and avoidance.

Ibsen wrote &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; in deliberate disregard of the limitations that the conventional stagecraft of the 19th century imposed on drama. Its forty scenes move uninhibitedly in time and space and between consciousness and the unconscious, blending folkloric fantasy and unsentimental realism. Raymond Williams compares &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; with August Strindberg&#x27;s early drama &quot;Lucky Peter&#x27;s Journey&quot; (1882) and argues that both explore a new kind of dramatic action that was beyond the capacities of the theatre of the day; both created &quot;a sequence of images in language and visual composition&quot; that &quot;became technically possible only in film.&quot; 

Ibsen believed &quot;Per Gynt&quot;, a Norwegian fairy-tale by which the play is loosely inspired, to be rooted in fact. He also wrote that he had used his own family—the intertwined Ibsen/Paus family of Skien—and childhood memories as &quot;some kind of model&quot; for the Gynt family; he acknowledged that the character of Åse—Peer Gynt&#x27;s mother—was based on his own mother, Marichen Altenburg, while Peer&#x27;s father Jon Gynt is widely interpreted as based on Ibsen&#x27;s father Knud Ibsen. He was also generally inspired by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen&#x27;s collection of Norwegian fairy-tales, &quot;Huldre-Eventyr og Folkesagn&quot;, published in 1845.

The play was written in Italy, and a first edition of 1,250 copies was published on 14 November 1867 by the Danish publisher Gyldendal in Copenhagen. Although the first edition swiftly sold out, a reprint of two thousand copies, which followed after only fourteen days, did not sell out until seven years later. During Ibsen&#x27;s lifetime, Denmark and Norway had a largely identical written language based on Danish, but Ibsen wrote &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; in a somewhat modernized Dano-Norwegian that included a number of distinct Norwegian words.

&quot;Peer Gynt&quot; was first performed in Christiania (now Oslo) on 24 February 1876, with original music composed by Edvard Grieg that includes some of today&#x27;s most recognised classical pieces, &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; and &quot;Morning Mood&quot;. It was published in German translation in 1881, in English in 1892, and in French in 1896. The contemporary influence of the play continues into the twenty-first century; it is widely performed internationally both in traditional and in modern experimental productions.

While Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson admired the play&#x27;s &quot;satire on Norwegian egotism, narrowness, and self-sufficiency&quot; and described it as &quot;magnificent&quot;, Hans Christian Andersen, Georg Brandes and Clemens Petersen all joined the widespread hostility, Petersen writing that the play was not poetry. Enraged by Petersen&#x27;s criticisms in particular, Ibsen defended his work by arguing that it &quot;&quot;is&quot; poetry; and if it isn&#x27;t, it will become such. The conception of poetry in our country, in Norway, shall shape itself according to this book.&quot; Despite this defense of his poetic achievement in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, the play was his last to employ verse; from &quot;The League of Youth&quot; (1869) onwards, Ibsen was to write drama only in prose.

==Characters==
==Plot==

===Act I===
Peer Gynt is the son of the once-highly regarded Jon Gynt, who spent all his money on feasting and living lavishly and had to leave his farm to become a wandering salesman, leaving his wife and son behind in debt. Åse, his wife, wished to raise her son to restore the lost fortune of his father, but Peer is soon considered to be useless. He is a poet and a braggart, not unlike the youngest son from the Norwegian fairy-tale &quot;The Ash Lad&quot;, with whom he shares some characteristics.

As the play opens, Peer gives an account of a reindeer hunt that went awry, a famous theatrical scene generally known as &quot;the Buckride&quot;. His mother scorns him for his vivid imagination, and taunts him because he spoiled his chances with Ingrid, the daughter of the richest farmer. Peer leaves for Ingrid&#x27;s wedding, scheduled for the following day, because he may still get a chance with the bride. His mother follows quickly to stop him from shaming himself completely.

At the wedding, the other guests taunt and laugh at Peer, especially the local blacksmith, Aslak, who holds a grudge after an earlier brawl. In the same wedding, Peer meets a family of Haugean newcomers from another valley. He instantly notices the elder daughter, Solveig, and asks her to dance. She refuses because her father would disapprove, and because Peer&#x27;s reputation has preceded him. She leaves, and Peer starts drinking. When he hears the bride has locked herself in, he seizes the opportunity, runs away with her, and spends the night with her in the mountains.

===Act II===
Peer is banished for kidnapping Ingrid. As he wanders the mountains, his mother and Solveig&#x27;s father search for him. Peer meets three amorous dairymaids who are waiting to be courted by trolls (a folklore motif from Gudbrandsdalen). He becomes highly intoxicated with them and spends the next day alone suffering from a hangover. He runs head-first into a rock and swoons, and the rest of the second act probably takes place in Peer&#x27;s dreams.

He comes across a woman clad in green, who claims to be the daughter of the troll mountain king. Together they ride into the mountain hall, and the troll king gives Peer the opportunity to become a troll if Peer would marry his daughter. Peer agrees to a number of conditions, but declines in the end. He is then confronted with the fact that the green-clad woman has become pregnant. Peer denies this; he claims not to have touched her, but the wise troll king replies that he begat the child in his head. Crucial for the plot and understanding of the play is the question asked by the troll king: &quot;What is the difference between troll and man?&quot;

The answer given by the Old Man of the Mountain is: &quot;Out there, where sky shines, humans say: &#x27;To thyself be true.&#x27; In here, trolls say: &#x27;To thyself be enough.&#x27;&quot; Egotism is a typical trait of the trolls in this play. From then on, Peer uses this as his motto, always proclaiming that he is himself. He then meets the Bøyg — a creature who has no real description. Asked the question &quot;Who are you?&quot; the Bøyg answers, &quot;Myself&quot;. In time, Peer also takes the Bøyg&#x27;s important saying as a motto: &quot;Go around&quot;. For the rest of his life he &quot;beats around the bush&quot; instead of facing himself or the truth.

Upon awaking, Peer is confronted by Helga, Solveig&#x27;s sister, who gives him food and regards from her sister. Peer gives the girl a silver button for Solveig to keep and asks that she not forget him.

===Act III===
As an outlaw, Peer struggles to build his own cottage in the hills. Solveig turns up and insists on living with him. She has made her choice, she says, and there will be no return for her. Peer is delighted and welcomes her, but as she enters the cabin, an old-looking woman in green garments appears with a limping boy at her side.

This is the green-clad woman from the mountain hall, and her half-human brat is the child begotten by Peer from his mind during his stay there. She has cursed Peer by forcing him to remember her and all his previous sins, when facing Solveig. Peer hears a ghostly voice saying &quot;Go roundabout, Peer&quot;, and decides to leave. He tells Solveig he has something heavy to fetch. He returns in time for his mother&#x27;s death, and then sets off overseas.

===Act IV===
Peer is away for many years, taking part in various occupations and playing various roles, including that of a businessman engaged in enterprises on the coast of Morocco. Here, he explains his view of life, and we learn that he is a businessman taking part in unethical transactions, including sending heathen images to China and trading slaves. In his defense, he points out that he has also sent missionaries to China, and he treated his slaves well.

His companions rob him, after he decides to support the Turks in suppressing a Greek revolt, and leave him alone on the shore. He then finds some stolen Bedouin gear, and, in these clothes, he is hailed as a prophet by a local tribe. He tries to seduce Anitra, the chieftain&#x27;s daughter, but she steals his money and rings, gets away, and leaves him.

Then he decides to become a historian and travels to Egypt. He wanders through the desert, passing the Colossi of Memnon and the Sphinx. As he addresses the Sphinx, believing it to be the Bøyg, he encounters the keeper of the local madhouse, himself insane, who regards Peer as the bringer of supreme wisdom. Peer comes to the madhouse and understands that all of the patients live in their own worlds, being themselves to such a degree that no one cares for anyone else. In his youth, Peer had dreamt of becoming an emperor. In this place, he is finally hailed as one — the emperor of the &quot;self&quot;. Peer despairs and calls for the &quot;Keeper of all fools&quot;, i.e., God.

===Act V===
Finally, on his way home as an old man, he is shipwrecked. Among those on board, he meets the Strange Passenger, who wants to make use of Peer&#x27;s corpse to find out where dreams have their origin. This passenger scares Peer out of his wits. Peer lands on shore bereft of all of his possessions, a pitiful and grumpy old man.

Back home in Norway, Peer attends a peasant funeral and an auction, where he offers for sale everything from his earlier life. The auction takes place at the very farm where the wedding once was held. Peer stumbles along and is confronted with all that he did not do, his unsung songs, his unmade works, his unwept tears, and his questions that were never asked. His mother comes back and claims that her deathbed went awry; he did not lead her to heaven with his ramblings.

Peer escapes and is confronted with the Button-molder, who maintains that Peer&#x27;s soul must be melted down with other faulty goods unless he can explain when and where in life he has been &quot;himself&quot;. Peer protests. He has been only that, and nothing else. Then he meets the troll king, who states that Peer has been a troll, not a man, most of his life.

The Button-molder says that he has to come up with something if he is not to be melted down. Peer looks for a priest to whom to confess his sins, and a character named &quot;The Lean One&quot; (who is the Devil) turns up. The Lean One believes Peer cannot be counted a real sinner who can be sent to Hell; he has committed no grave sin.

Peer despairs in the end, understanding that his life is forfeit; he is nothing. But at the same moment, Solveig starts to sing—the cabin Peer built is close at hand, but he dares not enter. The Bøyg in Peer tells him &quot;go around&quot;. The Button-molder shows up and demands a list of sins, but Peer has none to give, unless Solveig can vouch for him. Then Peer breaks through to Solveig, asking her to forgive his sins. But she answers: &quot;You have not sinned at all, my dearest boy.&quot;

Peer does not understand—he believes himself lost. Then he asks her: &quot;Where has Peer Gynt been since we last met? Where was I as the one I should have been, whole and true, with the mark of God on my brow?&quot; She answers: &quot;In my faith, in my hope, in my love.&quot; Peer screams, calls for his mother, and hides himself in her lap. Solveig sings her lullaby for him, and he presumably dies in this last scene of the play, although there are neither stage directions nor dialogue to indicate that he actually does.

Behind the corner, the Button-molder, who is sent by God, still waits, with the words: &quot;Peer, we shall meet at the last crossroads, and then we shall see if... I&#x27;ll say no more.&quot;

==Analysis==
Klaus van den Berg argues that &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; ... is a stylistic minefield: Its origins are romantic, but the play also anticipates the fragmentations of emerging Modernism. Chronicling Peer&#x27;s journey from the Norwegian mountains to the North African desert, the cinematic script blends poetry with social satire, and realistic scenes with surreal ones. The irony of isolated individuals in a mass society infuses Ibsen&#x27;s tale of two seemingly incompatible lovers – the deeply committed Solveig and the superficial Peer, who is more a surface for projections than a coherent character. The simplest conclusion one may draw from &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, is expressed in the eloquent prose of the author: “&quot;If you lie; are you real?&quot;” 

The literary critic Harold Bloom in his book &quot;The Western Canon&quot; has challenged the conventional reading of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, stating:Far more than Goethe&#x27;s Faust, Peer is the one nineteenth-century literary character who has the largeness of the grandest characters of Renaissance imaginings. Dickens, Tolstoy, Stendhal, Hugo, even Balzac have no single figure quite so exuberant, outrageous, vitalistic as Peer Gynt. He merely &quot;seems&quot; initially to be an unlikely candidate for such eminence: &quot;What is he&quot;, we say, &quot;except a kind of Norwegian roaring boy?&quot; – marvelously attractive to women, a kind of bogus poet, a narcissist, absurd self-idolator, a liar, seducer, bombastic self-deceiver. But this is paltry moralizing – all too much like the scholarly chorus that rants against Falstaff. True, Peer, unlike Falstaff, is not a great wit. But in the Yahwistic, biblical sense, Peer the scamp bears the blessing: More life.

==Writing process==
On 5 January 1867 Ibsen wrote to Frederik Hegel, his publisher, with his plan for the play: it would be &quot;a long dramatic poem, having as its principal a part-legendary, part-fictional character from Norwegian folklore during &quot;recent&quot; times. It will bear no resemblance to &quot;Brand&quot;, and will contain no direct polemics or anything of that kind.&quot;

He began to write &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; on 14 January, employing a far greater variety of metres in its rhymed verse than he had used in his previous verse plays &quot;Brand&quot; (written 1865) or &quot;Love&#x27;s Comedy&quot; (written 1862). The first two acts were completed in Rome and the third in Casamicciola on the north of the island of Ischia.

During this time, Ibsen told Vilhelm Bergsøe that &quot;I don&#x27;t think the play&#x27;s for acting&quot; when they discussed the possibility of staging the play&#x27;s image of a casting-ladle &quot;big enough to re-cast human beings in.&quot; Ibsen sent the three acts to his publisher on 8 August, with a letter that explains that &quot;Peer Gynt was a real person who lived in Gudbrandsdal, probably around the end of the last century or the beginning of this. His name is still famous among the people up there, but not much more is known about his life than what is to be found in Asbjørnsen&#x27;s &quot;Norwegian Folktales&quot; (in the section entitled &#x27;Stories from the Mountain&#x27;).&quot; In those stories, Peer Gynt rescues the three dairy-maids from the trolls and shoots the Bøyg, who was originally a gigantic worm-shaped troll-being. Peer was known to tell tall tales of his own achievements, a trait Peer in the play inherited. The &quot;buck-ride&quot; story, which Peer tells his mother in the play&#x27;s first scene, is also from this source, but, as Åse points out, it was originally Gudbrand Glesne from Vågå who did the tour with the reindeer stag and finally shot it.

Following an earthquake on Ischia on 14 August, Ibsen left for Sorrento, where he completed the final two acts; he finished the play on 14 October. It was published in a first edition of 1,250 copies a month later in Copenhagen.

==Background==
Ibsen&#x27;s previous play, &quot;Brand&quot;, preached the philosophy of “All or nothing.” Relentless, cruel, resolute, overriding in will, Brand went through everything that stood in his way toward gaining an ideal. &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; is a compensating balance, a complementary color to &quot;Brand&quot;. In contrast to Brand, with his iron will, Peer is willless, insufficient, and irresolute. Peer &quot;goes around&quot; all issues facing him.

&quot;Brand&quot; had a phenomenal literary success, and people became curious to know what Ibsen&#x27;s next play would be. The dramatist, about this time, was relieved of financial worry by two money grants, one from the Norwegian government and the other from the Scientific Society of Trondhjem. This enabled him to give to his work an unfettered mind. He went with his family to Frascati, where, in the Palazzo rooms, he looked many feet down upon the Mediterranean, and pondered his new drama. He preserved a profound silence about the content of the play, and begged his publisher, Hegel, to create as much mystery about it as possible.
The portrayal of the Gynt family is known to be based on Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s own family—the intertwined Ibsen/Paus family of Skien—and childhood memories; in a letter to Georg Brandes, Ibsen wrote that his own family and childhood had served &quot;as some kind of model&quot; for the Gynt family. In a letter to Peter Hansen, Ibsen confirmed that the character Åse, Peer Gynt&#x27;s mother, was based on his own mother, Marichen Altenburg. The character Jon Gynt is considered to be based on Ibsen&#x27;s father Knud Ibsen, who was a rich merchant before he went bankrupt. Even the name of the Gynt family&#x27;s ancestor, the prosperous Rasmus Gynt, is borrowed from the Ibsen&#x27;s family&#x27;s earliest known ancestor. Thus, the character Peer Gynt could be interpreted as being an ironic representation of Henrik Ibsen himself. There are striking similarities to Ibsen&#x27;s own life; Ibsen himself spent 27 years living abroad and was never able to face his hometown again.

==Grieg&#x27;s music==

Ibsen asked Edvard Grieg to compose incidental music for the play. Grieg composed a score that plays approximately ninety minutes. Grieg extracted two suites of four pieces each from the incidental music (Opus 46 and Opus 55), which became very popular as concert music. One of the sung parts of the incidental music, &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot;, was included in the first suite with the vocal parts omitted. Originally, the second suite had a fifth number, &quot;The Dance of the Mountain King&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, but Grieg withdrew it. Grieg himself declared that it was easier to make music &quot;out of his own head&quot; than strictly following suggestions made by Ibsen. For instance, Ibsen wanted music that would characterize the &quot;international&quot; friends in the fourth act, by melding the said national anthems (Norwegian, Swedish, German, French and English). Reportedly, Grieg was not in the right mood for this task.

The music of these suites, especially &quot;Morning Mood&quot; starting the first suite, &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot;, and the string lament &quot;Åse&#x27;s Death&quot; later reappeared in numerous arrangements, soundtracks, etc.

Other Norwegian composers who have written theatrical music for &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; include Harald Sæverud (1947), Arne Nordheim (1969), Ketil Hvoslef (1993) and Jon Mostad (1993–4). Gunnar Sønstevold (1966) wrote music for a ballet version of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

==Notable productions==
In 1906, scenes from the play were given by the Progressive Stage Society of New York. The first US production of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; opened at the Chicago Grand Opera House on October 24, 1906, and starred the noted actor Richard Mansfield, in one of his very last roles before his untimely death. In 1923, Joseph Schildkraut played the role on Broadway, in a Theatre Guild production, featuring Selena Royle, Helen Westley, Dudley Digges, and, before he entered films, Edward G. Robinson. In 1944, at the Old Vic, Ralph Richardson played the role, surrounded by some of the greatest British actors of the time in supporting or bit roles, among them Sybil Thorndike as Åse, and Laurence Olivier as the Button Molder. In 1951, John Garfield fulfilled his wish to star in a Broadway production, featuring Mildred Dunnock as Åse. This production was not a success, and is said by some to have contributed to Garfield&#x27;s death at age 39.

On film, years before he became a superstar, the seventeen-year-old Charlton Heston starred as Peer in a silent, student-made, low-budget film version of the play produced in 1941. &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, however, has never been given a full-blown treatment as a sound film in English on the motion picture screen, although there have been several television productions, and a sound film was produced in German in 1934.

In 1957, Ingmar Bergman produced a five-hour stage version of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, at Sweden&#x27;s Malmö City Theatre, with Max von Sydow as Peer Gynt. Bergman produced the play again, 34 years later, in 1991, at Sweden&#x27;s Royal Dramatic Theatre, this time with Börje Ahlstedt in the title role. Bergman chose not to use Grieg&#x27;s music, nor the more modern Harald Sæverud composition, but rather traditional Norwegian folk music, and little of that either.

In 1993, Christopher Plummer starred in his own concert version of the play, with the Hartford Symphony Orchestra in Hartford, Connecticut. This was a new performing version and a collaboration of Plummer and Hartford Symphony Orchestra Music Director Michael Lankester. Plummer had long dreamed of starring in a fully staged production of the play, but had been unable to. The 1993 production was not a fully staged version, but rather a drastically condensed concert version, narrated by Plummer, who also played the title role, and accompanied by Edvard Grieg&#x27;s complete incidental music for the play. This version included a choir and vocal parts for soprano and mezzo-soprano. Plummer performed the concert version again in 1995 with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra with Lankester conducting. The 1995 production was broadcast on Canadian radio. It has never been presented on television nor released on compact disc. In the 1990s Plummer and Lankester also collaborated on and performed similarly staged concert versions of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; by William Shakespeare (with music by Mendelssohn) and &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; (an arrangement of a Prokofiev film score with script for narrator). Among the three aforementioned Plummer/Lankester collaborations, all received live concert presentations and live radio broadcasts, but only &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; was released on CD.

Alex Jennings won the Olivier Award for Best Actor 1995/1996 for his performance in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

In 1999, Braham Murray directed a production at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester with David Threlfall as Peer Gynt, Josette Bushell-Mingo as Solveig and Espen Skjønberg as Button Moulder.

In 2000, the Royal National Theatre staged a version based on the 1990 translation of the play by Frank McGuinness. The production featured three actors playing Peer, including Chiwetel Ejiofor as the young Peer, Patrick O&#x27;Kane as Peer in his adventures in Africa, and Joseph Marcell as the old Peer. Not only was the use of three actors playing one character unusual in itself, but the actors were part of a &quot;color-blind&quot; cast: Ejiofor and Marcell are black, and O&#x27;Kane is white.

In 2001, at the BBC Proms, the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra and BBC Singers, conducted by Manfred Honeck, performed the complete incidental music in Norwegian with an English narration read by Simon Callow.

In 2005, Chicago&#x27;s storefront theater The Artistic Home mounted an acclaimed production (directed by Kathy Scambiatterra and written by Norman Ginsbury) that received two Jeff Nominations for its dynamic staging in a 28-seat house. The role of Peer was played by a single actor, John Mossman.

In 2006, Robert Wilson staged a co-production revival with both the National Theater of Bergen and the Norwegian Theatre of Oslo, Norway. Ann-Christin Rommen directed the actors in Norwegian (with English subtitles). This production mixed both Wilson&#x27;s minimalist (yet constantly moving) stage designs with technological effects to bring out the play&#x27;s expansive potential. Furthermore, they utilized state-of-the-art microphones, sound systems, and recorded acoustic and electronic music to bring clarity to the complex and shifting action and dialogue. From April 11 through the 16th, they performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s Howard Gilman Opera House.

In 2006, as part of the Norwegian Ibsen anniversary festival, &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; was set at the foot of the Great Sphinx of Giza near Cairo, Egypt (an important location in the original play). The director was Bentein Baardson. The performance was the centre of some controversy, with some critics seeing it as a display of colonialist attitudes.

In January 2008, the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis debuted a new translation of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; by the poet Robert Bly. Bly learned Norwegian from his grandparents while growing up in rural Minnesota, and later during several years of travel in Norway. This production stages Ibsen&#x27;s text rather abstractly, tying it loosely into a modern birthday party for a 50-year-old man. It also significantly cuts the length of the play. (An earlier production of the full-length play at the Guthrie required the audience to return a second night to see the second half of the play.)

In 2009, Dundee Rep with the National Theatre of Scotland toured a production. This interpretation, with much of the dialogue in modern Scots, received mixed reviews. The cast included Gerry Mulgrew as the older Peer. Directed by Dominic Hill.

In November 2010, Southampton Philharmonic Choir and the New London Sinfonia performed the complete incidental music using a new English translation commissioned from Beryl Foster. In the performance, the musical elements were linked by an English narrative read by actor Samuel West.

From June 28 through July 24, 2011, La Jolla Playhouse ran a production of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; as a co-production with the Kansas City Repertory Theatre, adapted and directed by David Schweizer.

The 2011 Dublin Theatre Festival presented a new version of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; by Arthur Riordan, directed by Lynne Parker with music by Tarab.

==The &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; Festival==
At Vinstra in Gudbrandsdalen (the Gudbrand valley), Henrik Ibsen and Peer Gynt have been celebrated with an annual festival since 1967. The festival is one of Norway&#x27;s largest cultural festivals, and is recognized by the Norwegian Government as a leading institution of presenting culture in nature. The festival has a broad festival program with theatre, concerts, an art exhibition and several debates and literature seminars.

The main event in the festival is the outdoor theatre production of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; at Gålå. The play is staged in &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;s birthplace, where Ibsen claims he found inspiration for the character Peer Gynt, and is regarded by many as the most authentic version. The play is performed by professional actors from the national theater institutions, and nearly 80 local amateur actors. The music to the play is inspired by the original theatre music by Edvard Grieg – the &quot;Peer Gynt suite&quot;. The play is one of the most popular theater productions in Norway, attracting more than 12,000 people every summer.

The festival also holds the Peer Gynt Prize, which is a national Norwegian honor prize given to a person or institution that has achieved distinction in society and contributed to improving Norway&#x27;s international reputation.

==&quot;Peer Gynt&quot; Sculpture Park==

&quot;Peer Gynt&quot; Sculpture Park (Peer Gynt-parken) is a sculpture park located in Oslo, Norway. Created in honour of Henrik Ibsen, it is a monumental presentation of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, scene by scene. It was established in 2006 by Selvaag, the company behind the housing development in the area. Most of the sculptures in this park are the result of an international sculpture competition.

==Adaptations==

In 1912, German writer Dietrich Eckart adapted the play. In Eckart&#x27;s version, the play became &quot;a powerful dramatisation of nationalist and anti-semitic ideas&quot;, in which Gynt represents the superior Germanic hero, struggling against implicitly Jewish &quot;trolls&quot;. In this racial allegory the trolls and Great Bøyg represented what philosopher Otto Weininger – Eckart&#x27;s hero – conceived as the Jewish spirit. Eckart&#x27;s version was one of the best attended productions of the age with more than 600 performances in Berlin alone. Eckart later helped to found the Nazi Party and served as a mentor to Adolf Hitler; he was also the first editor of the party&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Völkische Beobachter&quot;. He never had another theatrical success after &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

In 1938, German composer Werner Egk finished an opera based on the story.

In 1948, the composer Harald Sæverud made a new score for the nynorsk-production at &quot;the Norwegian Theatre&quot; (Det Norske Teatret) in Oslo. Sæverud incorporated the national music of each of the friends in the fourth act, as per Ibsen&#x27;s request, who died in 1906.

In 1951, North Carolinian playwright Paul Green published an American version of the Norwegian play. This is the version in which John Garfield starred on Broadway. This version is also the &quot;American Version&quot;, and features subtle plot differences from Ibsen&#x27;s original work, including the omittance of the shipwreck scene near the end, and the &quot;Buttonmolder&quot; character playing a moderately larger role.

In 1961, Hugh Leonard&#x27;s version, &quot;The Passion of Peter Ginty&quot;, transferred the play to an Irish Civil War setting. It was staged at Dublin&#x27;s Gate Theatre.

In 1969, Broadway impresario Jacques Levy (who had previously directed the first version of &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;) commissioned The Byrds&#x27; Roger McGuinn to write the music for a pop (or country-rock) version of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, to be titled &quot;Gene Tryp&quot;. The play was apparently never completed, although, as of 2006, McGuinn was preparing a version for release. Several songs from the abortive show appeared on the Byrds&#x27; albums of 1970 and 1971.

In March 1972 Jerry Heymann&#x27;s adaptation, called &quot;Mr. Gynt, Inc.&quot;, was performed at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club.

In 1981, Houston Ballet presented &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; as adapted by Artistic Director Ben Stevenson, OBE.

In 1989, John Neumeier created a ballet &quot;freely based on Ibsen&#x27;s play&quot;, for which Alfred Schnittke composed the score.

In 1998, the Trinity Repertory Company of Providence, Rhode Island commissioned David Henry Hwang and Swiss director Stephan Muller to do an adaptation of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

In 1998, playwright Romulus Linney directed his adaptation of the play, entitled &quot;Gint&quot;, at the Theatre for the New City in New York. This adaptation moved the play&#x27;s action to 20th-century Appalachia and California.

In 2001, Rogaland Theatre produced an adaptation titled &quot;Peer Gynt-innen?&quot;, loosely translated as &quot;Peer the Gyntess?&quot;. This was a one-act monologue performed by Marika Enstad.

In 2007, St. John&#x27;s Prep of Danvers, Massachusetts, won the MHSDG Festival with their production starring Bo Burnham.

In 2008, Theater in the Open in Newburyport, Massachusetts, produced a production of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; adapted and directed by Paul Wann and the company. Scott Smith, whose great-great-grandfather (Ole Bull) was one of the inspirations for the character, was cast as Gynt.

In 2009, a DVD was released of Heinz Spoerli&#x27;s ballet, which he had created in 2007. This ballet uses mostly the Grieg music, but adds selections by other composers. Spoken excerpts from the play, in Norwegian, are also included.

In Israel, poet Dafna Eilat (:he:דפנה אילת) composed a poem in Hebrew titled &quot;Solveig&quot;, which she also set to music, its theme derived from the play and emphasizing the named character&#x27;s boundless faithful love. It was performed by Hava Alberstein (see ).

In 2011, Polarity Ensemble Theatre in Chicago presented another version of Robert Bly&#x27;s translation of the play, in which Peer&#x27;s mythic journey was envisioned as that of America itself, &quot;a 150-year whirlwind tour of the American psyche.&quot;

On an episode of &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, Elton John spontaneously composed a song based on a passage from &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

The German a cappella metal band Van Canto also made a theatrical adaptation of the story, naming it &quot;Peer Returns&quot;. The first episode that has been released called &quot;A Storm to Come&quot;, appears on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Break the Silence&quot;.

American composer Mary McCarty Snow (1928–2012) composed music for a Texas Tech University production of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

Will Eno&#x27;s adaptation of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;, titled &quot;Gnit&quot;, had its world premiere at the 37th Humana Festival of New American Plays in March 2013.

In 2020, a new audio drama adaptation of &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; by Colin Macnee, written in verse form with original music, was released in podcast form.

<doc id="555560" wikidata="Q557758" url="?curid=555560" title="Piers Morgan">
<text>Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan (; O&#x27;Meara, born 30 March 1965) is an English broadcaster, journalist, writer, and media personality. He began his career in 1988 at the tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot;. In 1994, at the age of 29, he was appointed editor of the &quot;News of the World&quot; by Rupert Murdoch, which made him the youngest editor of a British national newspaper in more than half a century. From 1995, Morgan edited the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, but was fired in 2004. He was the editorial director of &quot;First News&quot; from 2006 to 2007. In 2014, Morgan became the first editor-at-large of the MailOnline website&#x27;s US operation. 

As a television presenter, Morgan hosted the ITV talk show &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot; (2009–2020), the CNN talk show &quot;Piers Morgan Live&quot; (2011–2014), and co-presented the ITV Breakfast programme &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; (2015–2021) alongside Susanna Reid. He has been a judge on the television talent shows &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2006–2011) and &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; (2007–2010). In 2008, Morgan won &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice US&quot;, appearing with future US president Donald Trump. He was a presenter for TalkTV (now known as Talk), hosting the program &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot; from 2022 to 2024, before leaving the network and moving the show to YouTube.

Morgan was the editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; during the period in which the paper was implicated in the phone hacking scandal. In 2011, Morgan denied having ever hacked a phone and stated that he had not, &quot;to [his] knowledge published any story obtained from the hacking of a phone&quot;. The following year, he was criticised in the findings of the Leveson Inquiry by chair Brian Leveson, who stated that comments made in Morgan&#x27;s testimony about phone hacking were &quot;utterly unpersuasive&quot; and &quot;that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it&quot;. The judge in a 2023 court case against Mirror Group Newspapers found truthful evidence that Morgan knew about private phone hacking from a reporter, shared a method of phone hacking with a media professional while being questioned about a reporting scoop, and that Morgan played another&#x27;s private phone message in the newsroom he had received from another tabloid editor.

Morgan&#x27;s outspoken views and controversial comments on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; have led Ofcom to adjudicate on multiple occasions. In March 2021, Morgan left the programme with immediate effect, following his criticism of the &quot;Oprah with Meghan and Harry&quot; interview. Ofcom received over 57,000 complaints from viewers, including a complaint from Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, herself; Morgan was subsequently cleared of wrongdoing by Ofcom.

== Early life and education ==
Morgan was born as Piers Stefan O&#x27;Meara in Guildford, Surrey on 30 March 1965, the son of Vincent Eamonn O&#x27;Meara, an Irish dentist, and Gabrielle Georgina Sybille (née Oliver), an English woman who raised Morgan as a Catholic. 
A few months after his birth, the family moved to Newick, East Sussex. His father died when Morgan was 11 months old; his mother later married Glynne Pughe-Morgan, a Welsh pub landlord who later worked in the meat distribution business, and he took his stepfather&#x27;s surname. He was educated at the independent Cumnor House prep school between the ages of seven and 13, then Chailey School, a comprehensive secondary school in Chailey, followed by Priory School, Lewes, for sixth form. After nine months at Lloyd&#x27;s of London, Morgan studied journalism at Harlow College, joining the Surrey and South London Newspaper Group in 1985.

==Press career==
===At the Murdoch titles (1988–1995)===
Morgan began to work as a freelance at &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1988, at this point dropping his double-barrelled name. He told Hunter Davies in December 1994 that he was personally recruited by &quot;Sun&quot; editor Kelvin MacKenzie to work on the newspaper&#x27;s show business column &quot;Bizarre&quot;, his first high-profile post. Although he was not a fan of pop music, he was considered skilled at self-publicity and became the column&#x27;s main writer. &quot;I became the Friend of the Stars, a rampant egomaniac, pictured all the time with famous people – Madonna, Stallone, Bowie, Paul McCartney, hundreds of them. It was shameless, as they didn&#x27;t know me from Adam&quot;, he told Davies.

In January 1994, he became editor of the &quot;News of the World&quot; after being appointed to the job by Rupert Murdoch. Initially an acting editor, he was confirmed in the summer, becoming at 29 the youngest national newspaper editor in more than half a century. In this period, the newspaper led with a series of scoops for which Morgan credited a highly efficient newsdesk and publicist Max Clifford.

Morgan left this post in 1995 shortly after publishing photographs of Catherine Victoria Lockwood, then wife of Charles, Earl Spencer, leaving an addictive disorders clinic in Surrey. This action ran against the editors&#x27; code of conduct, a misdemeanour for which the Press Complaints Commission upheld a complaint against Morgan. Murdoch was reported as having said that &quot;the boy went too far&quot; and publicly distanced himself from the story. Fearful of a privacy law action if he had not criticised one of his employees, Murdoch is said to have apologised to Morgan in private.

The incident was reported to have contributed to Morgan&#x27;s decision to leave for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; editorship. Morgan&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Insider&quot; states that he left the &quot;News of the World&quot; for the &quot;Mirror&quot; of his own choice. It asserts he was an admirer of former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for most of her period of office, making the appointment surprising as the &quot;Mirror&quot; is a Labour-supporting title.

===&quot;Daily Mirror&quot; editor===
As editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Morgan apologised on television for the headline (rendered in upper case) &quot;Achtung Surrender! For You Fritz Ze Euro Championship Is Over&quot; on 25 June 1996, a day before England met Germany in a semi-final of the Euro &#x27;96 football championships. The headline was accompanied by an open letter from Morgan parodying Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s declaration of war on Germany in 1939. &quot;It was intended as a joke, but anyone who was offended by it must have taken it seriously, and to those people I say sorry,&quot; he said. Germany won the match and went on to win the championship final at Wembley Stadium, London.

Under Morgan&#x27;s leadership, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; spent £16 million on a rebranding project, including the dropping of &quot;Daily&quot; from the masthead in February 1997, which was later reversed. Roy Greenslade wrote in August 1999 that Morgan&#x27;s editorship &quot;has made a huge difference: his enormous enthusiasm, determination and focus is a major plus&quot;.

Morgan was the subject of an investigation in 2000 after Suzy Jagger wrote an article for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; revealing that he had bought £20,000 worth of shares in the computer company Viglen soon before the &quot;Mirror&quot;″s &quot;City Slickers&quot; column tipped Viglen as a good buy. Morgan was found by the Press Complaints Commission to have breached the Code of Conduct on financial journalism, but kept his job. The &quot;City Slickers&quot; columnists, Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, were both found to have committed further breaches of the Code and were sacked before the inquiry concluded. Further enquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry in 2004 cleared Morgan of any charges. On 7 December 2005, Bhoyrul and Hipwell were convicted of conspiracy to breach the Financial Services Act. During the trial it emerged that Morgan had bought £67,000 worth of Viglen shares, emptying his bank account and investing under his (first) wife&#x27;s name as well.

The &quot;Mirror&quot; attempted to move mid-market in 2002, eschewing the more trivial stories of show-business and gossip, and appointed Christopher Hitchens as a columnist, but sales declined. In October 2003, journalist and television personality Jeremy Clarkson emptied a glass of water over Morgan during the last flight of Concorde in response to some photographs published in the &quot;Mirror&quot;. In March 2004, at the British Press Awards, Clarkson punched Morgan three times during another argument. In &quot;Campbell v MGN Ltd&quot;, the Law Lords in May 2004 found in favour of model Naomi Campbell on privacy grounds after the &quot;Mirror&quot; had published a photograph of her entering a Narcotics Anonymous clinic. Morgan was critical of the judgement saying it was &quot;a good day for lying, drug-abusing prima donnas who want to have their cake with the media and the right to then shamelessly guzzle with their Cristal champagne.&quot;

In the wake of the Abu Ghraib torture scandal, Morgan was sacked as editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; &quot;with immediate effect&quot; on 14 May 2004, after refusing to apologise to Sly Bailey, then head of Trinity Mirror, for authorising the newspaper&#x27;s publication of fake photographs. The photos were alleged to show Iraqi prisoners being abused by British Army soldiers from the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment. Within days the photographs were shown to be crude fakes. According to official British sources, the photographs were apparently taken in North-West England. Under the headline &quot;SORRY..WE WERE HOAXED&quot;, the &quot;Mirror&quot; responded that it had fallen victim to a &quot;calculated and malicious hoax&quot; and apologised for the publication of the photographs. However, Morgan refused to admit that the photographs were faked, and stated that the abuse shown in the photographs is similar to the sort of abuse that was happening in the British Army in Iraq at the time.

====Phone hacking allegations====
During Morgan&#x27;s tenure as editor, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; was advised by Steven Nott that voicemail interception was possible by means of a standard PIN code. Despite staff initially expressing enthusiasm for the story it did not appear in the paper, although it did subsequently feature in a &quot;South Wales Argus&quot; article and on BBC Radio 5 Live in October 1999. On 18 July 2011, Nott was visited by officers of Operation Weeting.

He came under criticism for his &quot;boasting&quot; about phone hacking from Conservative MP Louise Mensch, who has since apologised for these accusations.

In July 2011, in a sequence of articles, political blogger Paul Staines alleged that while editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 2002 Morgan published a story concerning the affair of Sven-Göran Eriksson and Ulrika Jonsson while knowing it to have been obtained by phone hacking.

On 20 December 2011, Morgan appeared as a witness by satellite link from the United States at the Leveson Inquiry. While he said he had no reason to believe that phone hacking had occurred at the &quot;Mirror&quot; while he was in charge there, he admitted to hearing a recording of an answerphone message left by Paul McCartney for Heather Mills, but refused to &quot;discuss where that tape was played or who made [it] – it would compromise a source.&quot; Appearing as a witness at the same Inquiry on 9 February 2012, Mills was asked under oath if she had ever made a recording of McCartney&#x27;s phone call or had played it to Morgan; she replied: &quot;Never&quot;. She said that she had never authorised Morgan, or anybody, to access or listen to her voicemails. Mills told the inquiry that Morgan, &quot;a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years&quot;, would have relished telling the inquiry if she had played a personal voicemail message to him.

On 23 May 2012, &quot;Newsnight&quot; presenter Jeremy Paxman was a witness at the Leveson Inquiry. He recalled a lunch with the &quot;Mirror&quot; editor in September 2002 at which Morgan outlined the means of hacking [or accessing] a mobile phone voicemail, using the SIM card network&#x27;s default security code.

On 28 November 2012, the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Taking on the Tabloids&quot;, fronted by actor and phone hacking victim Hugh Grant, showed footage from a 2003 interview with Morgan by the singer and phone hacking victim Charlotte Church, during which he explained to her how to avoid answerphone messages being listened to by journalists. He said: &quot;You can access ... voicemails by typing in a number. Now, are you really telling me that journalists aren&#x27;t going to do that?&quot;

On 29 November 2012, the official findings of the Leveson Inquiry were released, in which Lord Justice Leveson said that Morgan&#x27;s testimony under oath on phone hacking was &quot;utterly unpersuasive&quot;. He stated: &quot;[The] evidence does not establish that [Morgan] authorised the hacking of voicemails or that journalists employed by TMG [Trinity Mirror Group] were indulging in this practice ... What it does, however, clearly prove is that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it.&quot;

On 6 December 2013, Morgan was interviewed, under caution, by police officers from Operation Weeting investigating phone hacking allegations at Mirror Group Newspapers during his tenure as editor.

On 24 September 2014, the Trinity Mirror publishing group admitted for the first time that some of its journalists had been involved in phone hacking and agreed to pay compensation to four people who sued for the alleged hacking of voicemails. Six other phone-hacking claims had already been settled. The BBC reported that it had seen legal papers showing that although the alleged hacking could have taken place as early as 1998, the bulk of the alleged wrongdoing took place in the early 2000s when Morgan was the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; editor. The admissions by Trinity Mirror came whilst the Metropolitan Police were investigating into the phone hacking allegations. Morgan has always denied any involvement in the practice.

In June 2023, during his case against Morgan&#x27;s former employer, Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), Prince Harry accused Morgan of attacking himself and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, to dissuade him from his legal action and of hacking his phone and that of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales. On , Harry was awarded £140,600 by the High Court in damages against MGN, after 15 out of 33 sample articles about him in his claim were ruled as being the product of phone hacking or other unlawful information gathering. In the ruling, Mr Justice Fancourt said Morgan and other editors knew about the phone hacking at their publications and were involved in it. In a statement made in response to the ruling, Morgan denied that he was involved in any phone hacking and reviled Harry. His statement was met with widespread criticism including from the former chair of the Independent Press Standards Organisation Sir Alan Moses.

As a result of the judge&#x27;s ruling, the pressure group Hacked Off called for the police to open an investigation into possible perjury committed by senior staff members at &quot;The Mirror&quot;, during the Leveson Inquiry.

===Post-&quot;Mirror&quot; press activities===
In partnership with Matthew Freud, he gained ownership in May 2005 of &quot;Press Gazette&quot;, a media trade publication together with its &quot;cash cow&quot;, the British Press Awards, in a deal worth £1 million. This ownership was cited as one of the reasons many major newspapers boycotted the 2006 awards. &quot;Press Gazette&quot; entered administrative receivership toward the end of 2006, before being sold to a trade buyer.

&quot;First News&quot; was launched by Morgan on 4 May 2006. A weekly paper aimed at seven to 14-year-olds, he said at its launch that the paper was to be &quot;Britain&#x27;s first national newspaper for children&quot;. Morgan was editorial director at &quot;First News&quot;, responsible for bringing in celebrity involvement. He referred to the role as &quot;editorial overlord and frontman&quot;.

In 2007, Morgan was filmed falling off a Segway, breaking three ribs. Simon Cowell outspokenly mocked Morgan&#x27;s previous comment in 2003, in a &quot;Mirror&quot; headline after former U.S. President George W. Bush fell off a Segway: &quot;You&#x27;d have to be an idiot to fall off wouldn&#x27;t you, Mr President&quot;.

In 2012, following the revelation of Jimmy Savile&#x27;s sexual abuse against children, Morgan said he had &quot;never met&quot; Savile in his lifetime, contradicting a 2009 piece he wrote in &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; &quot;Night &amp; Day&quot; magazine saying that &quot;As I left, Jimmy Savile came up to me. &#x27;Your TV shows are BRILLIANT!, he exclaimed. ... I&#x27;ve always loved Jimmy Savile.&quot;

In September 2014, Morgan became the first editor-at-large of the MailOnline website&#x27;s US operation and wrote several columns a week.

==Television career==

Morgan&#x27;s career expanded into television presenting before he left the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. He presented a three-part television documentary series for the BBC titled &quot;The Importance of Being Famous&quot; (2003), about fame and the manner in which celebrities are covered by modern media. At the annual Pride of Britain Awards broadcast on ITV, Morgan chaired a panel of prominent people who had chosen the recipients of the awards from 1999 to 2006. He co-hosted a current affairs interview show on Channel 4 with Amanda Platell, &quot;Morgan and Platell&quot;. Morgan and Platell were put together because of their opposing political viewpoints; Platell interrogated guests from the right wing, Morgan from the left wing. The show was dropped after three series reputedly because of poor viewing figures, although the chairman of Channel 4 Luke Johnson was reported not to like the programme.

Throughout 2006, Morgan appeared as a judge on the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; alongside Brandy Norwood and David Hasselhoff on NBC. Morgan was chosen by Simon Cowell as a replacement for himself because of the conditions of his &quot;American Idol&quot; contract. Morgan appeared as a celebrity contestant on &quot;Comic Relief Does The Apprentice&quot; in 2007 to raise money for the BBC charity telethon Comic Relief. After his team lost, Morgan was selected by Sir Alan Sugar as the contestant to be fired. In 2007, Morgan appeared as a judge for the second season of &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; and also appeared as a judge on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; on ITV with Amanda Holden and Simon Cowell. He also presented &quot;You Can&#x27;t Fire Me, I&#x27;m Famous&quot; on BBC One. He fronted a three-part documentary about Sandbanks for ITV entitled &quot;Piers Morgan on Sandbanks&quot; in January 2008. In 2008, Morgan signed a two-year &quot;golden handcuffs&quot; deal with ITV in May, reportedly worth £2 million per year. As part of the deal, he would continue as a judge on &quot;Britain&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; for at least two more series and front a new chat show. He also made some interview specials, plus three more documentaries from various countries. Morgan&#x27;s golden handcuffs deal was the first signing by ITV&#x27;s new director of television, Peter Fincham.

In February 2009, he began a three-part series, &quot;Piers Morgan On...&quot;, which saw him visit Dubai, Monte Carlo and Hollywood. The programme returned for a second series in 2010 when Morgan visited Las Vegas in one episode. In 2009, Morgan also began hosting &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot; on ITV, with Sharon Osbourne as the subject of the first episode. Other guests on the programme included Cheryl and the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. On 17 January 2011, Morgan replaced Larry King in CNN&#x27;s evening line-up with his show, &quot;Piers Morgan Live&quot;. After poor ratings, the show was cancelled in February 2014 and ended its run in March 2014. Commenting on the viewing figures, Morgan said that he was &quot;a British guy debating American cultural issues, including guns, which has been very polarizing, and there is no doubt that there are many in the audience who are tired of me banging on about it.&quot;

From 13 to 17 April 2015, Morgan guest-hosted five episodes of &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; on ITV and became a permanent co-host in November 2015, appearing alongside Susanna Reid and Charlotte Hawkins. He often clashed with Reid, who said of her colleague: &quot;You can&#x27;t help but go into battle with him every morning&quot;. Morgan left the series in March 2021 following a controversy over his remarks about &quot;Oprah with Meghan and Harry&quot;, which included a heated on-air argument with Alex Beresford.

From 2016 to 2017, Morgan interviewed female murderers on the TV series &quot;Killer Women with Piers Morgan&quot;. He also presented &quot;Serial Killer with Piers Morgan&quot;, as part of the 2017 Crime &amp; Punishment season on ITV. In October 2018, Morgan appeared as a cameo on &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;.

===Donald Trump===
Morgan was the winner of the U.S. celebrity version of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; in 2008. He was eventually the overall winner, being named Celebrity Apprentice by host Donald Trump on 27 March, ahead of fellow finalist, American country music star Trace Adkins, and having raised substantially more cash than all the other contestants combined. Morgan was called &quot;ruthless, arrogant, evil and obnoxious&quot; by Trump in the final. Morgan stated he personally would not vote for Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election (though as a permanent resident of the United States, not a citizen, he is not qualified to vote). He predicted Trump&#x27;s election as President of the United States and described himself as a close friend. Morgan interviewed Trump on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; in March 2016. Morgan appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Loose Women&quot; panel show in late January 2017, and was challenged to repudiate Trump. He stated that he disagreed with him on many issues relating to gun control, climate change, abortion, and the &quot;Muslim travel ban&quot;. On the latter he stated that Donald Trump had &quot;singled out seven countries that are undeniably war-torn, and he said we need to be very careful who we let into America from these countries&quot;, adding that he found &quot;the principle of what [Trump] is doing understandable&quot;, but that he disagreed with &quot;the way [Trump] has gone about it&quot;.

Nearly a fortnight later, on the American talk show &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, Morgan said &quot;There is no Muslim ban&quot;, as &quot;85% of the world&#x27;s Muslims are allowed in the country&quot;. Another participant in the discussion, Australian comedian Jim Jefferies, immediately swore at Morgan and criticised his defence of Trump. After the novelist J. K. Rowling tweeted &quot;Yes, watching Piers Morgan being told to fuck off on live TV is *exactly* as satisfying as I&#x27;d always imagined&quot;, the two began an exchange of words on the social media site. Morgan criticised Trump after Trump had retweeted Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of the small far-right fascist party Britain First, in late November 2017. He tweeted to Trump: &quot;What the hell are you doing retweeting a bunch of unverified videos by Britain First, a bunch of disgustingly racist far-right extremists? Please STOP this madness &amp; undo your retweets&quot;.

In January 2018, Morgan presented &quot;President Trump – The Piers Morgan Interview&quot; for ITV, which many thought of as &quot;sycophantic&quot; and a &quot;love-in&quot; for Trump. Of respondents to a &quot;Radio Times&quot; Twitter poll, 88% viewed Morgan as being not &quot;tough enough&quot; on Trump. Morgan interviewed Trump again in July 2018 during his official visit to the UK, this time on Air Force One during an internal flight, in a TV special entitled &quot;Piers, The President and Air Force One&quot;. In December 2018, Morgan wrote a letter to Trump formally applying to become White House Chief of Staff. During Trump&#x27;s state visit to the United Kingdom in June 2019, Morgan once again interviewed Trump, this time at the Churchill War Rooms.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Morgan wrote a highly critical article of Trump&#x27;s handling of the crisis in his column for MailOnline. Morgan particularly took issue with Trump&#x27;s suggestion of looking into &quot;ingesting&quot; disinfectant as a possible solution, describing it as &quot;batshit crazy&quot;. In response to the criticism, Trump unfollowed Morgan on Twitter. In the aftermath of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Morgan stated that Trump was &quot;mentally unfit&quot; to remain as president. He claimed that the pandemic and Trump&#x27;s election loss that followed had &quot;sent him nuts&quot;. In response to whether he regretted his support of Trump, Morgan said &quot;No question. I never thought he was capable of this.&quot;

In April 2022, the then former president sat down with Morgan for an interview. Morgan told Trump that he had lost a free and fair election, Trump responded with calling him a fool and later walking out of the interview calling Morgan “very dishonest”. 

In 2023, Morgan said the GOP needs winner Ron DeSantis, not political suicide bomber Trump after an Interview, where DeSantis expressed his confidence that he would beat Joe Biden in the general election. Trump responded by attacking both DeSantis and Morgan where he said “Ron DeSanctimonious is not working for the people of Florida as he should be, he is too busy chatting with a Ratings Challenged TV Host from England”.

===Meghan, Duchess of Sussex===
Morgan was briefly a friend of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex before she became the Duchess of Sussex, but said she cut him off early in her relationship with Prince Harry. He has been a regular critic of the couple since then, alleging they are hypocrites and claiming the Duchess is a social climber.

When the couple stepped away from conducting official royal duties early in 2020, Morgan described them as being &quot;the two most spoiled brats in history&quot;. Ten days later, he said: &quot;Only surprised it took her so long to get Harry to ditch his family, the monarchy, the military and his country. What a piece of work.&quot; In a segment of &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; on 13 January, Morgan interviewed Afua Hirsch, who accused parts of the British media of behaving in a racist manner towards the Duchess, an interpretation that Morgan said was &quot;completely and grotesquely wrong&quot;. InfluencHers, a group of 100 African Caribbean women, advocated an advertisers&#x27; boycott of &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;. The campaigners described the programme as &quot;sanctioning bullying and blatant unapologetic disrespect of women&quot; in allowing Morgan&#x27;s treatment of Hirsch.

When challenged by Decca Aitkenhead of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in May 2020 over &quot;his vendetta&quot; against the Duchess, with Aitkenhead suggesting he had gone too far, Morgan said: &quot;I think that&#x27;s a perfectly fair criticism. It&#x27;s probably not wise, if you&#x27;re a columnist, to make things too personal. Have I taken things a bit too far? Probably. Do I think that will govern and temper how I talk about them going forward? Absolutely.&quot;

On &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; on 8 and 9 March 2021, Morgan said he doubted the accuracy of the account given by the Duchess of Sussex, in the interview &quot;Oprah with Meghan and Harry&quot; with Oprah Winfrey, in which she spoke of her mental health issues, which included suicidal thoughts, and she and Harry alleged racist comments from the extended family. A tense on-air argument with his co-host Alex Beresford on 9 March led him to walk off the set of the show. Beresford was highly critical of Morgan&#x27;s attitude towards the Duchess, saying &quot;She&#x27;s entitled to cut you off if she wants to. Has she said anything about you after she cut you off? I don&#x27;t think she has, But yet you continue to trash her&quot;. Later in the day, Morgan quit the programme. The UK&#x27;s mental health charity Mind expressed &quot;disappointment&quot; in Morgan&#x27;s comments and said individuals with experience of mental health issues should be &quot;treated with dignity, respect and empathy&quot;. ITV plc&#x27;s chief executive, Carolyn McCall, defended the veracity of the Duchess&#x27;s comments, adding &quot;importantly everyone should&quot;.

ITV News reported the Duchess had complained directly to ITV&#x27;s CEO about Morgan&#x27;s comments about mental health, although the broadcaster was not officially commenting on these reports. Ofcom received a complaint from her.

Morgan issued a statement on Twitter, saying, &quot;On Monday, I said I didn&#x27;t believe Meghan Markle in her Oprah interview. I&#x27;ve had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don&#x27;t. Freedom of speech is a hill I&#x27;m happy to die on.&quot; Broadcaster Andrew Neil described his departure as &quot;a pity&quot; for ITV because he had brought &quot;energy, dynamism and controversy&quot; to its morning broadcast schedule, adding &quot;it had always lagged way behind the BBC breakfast time show and people tuned in because of him.&quot; Neil expressed interest in Morgan joining GB News instead. However, Neil later said that talks were affected by a disagreement: &quot;he&#x27;s [Morgan] got his own idea of what he is worth and we [GB News] have a slightly different idea of what he&#x27;s worth&quot;. In Morgan&#x27;s last week, &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; surpassed the ratings of BBC Breakfast for the first time, and ITV lost almost £200m in market value following his departure.

Actor and comedian Steve Coogan, a prominent supporter of press regulation, described Morgan as &quot;symptomatic of the problem&quot; with the British tabloid media and accused him of &quot;bullying behaviour&quot; regarding his attitude to the Duchess.

On 29 November 2023, Morgan used his &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot; show to reveal the names of two members of the British Royal Family who had allegedly had conversations about the skin colour of Meghan&#x27;s baby, mentioned during an interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021. Both Prince Harry and Meghan had refused to elaborate on who had made these claims. Journalist Omid Scobie named the royals in the Dutch version of his book &quot;Endgame&quot;, despite other versions not containing the names, and the book was pulled from sale. After Morgan had named the royals, a source for the family said they were &quot;considering all options.&quot; Morgan defended his comments the following night, saying it was &quot;entirely lawful&quot; to name the Royals.

===Ofcom complaints===
Morgan&#x27;s comments during his tenure at &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; resulted in thousands of complaints to the British media watchdog Ofcom.

In 2015, Morgan was criticised by Ofcom for laughing as a guest repeatedly used the word &#x27;fucking&#x27; live on air. Although Ofcom did not take action as his co-presenter Susanna Reid quickly apologised, the watchdog expressed concern at his behaviour.

In 2016, Ofcom received 70 complaints in relation to comments made by Morgan during an interview with the Christian magistrate Richard Page about gay marriage, comments that viewers felt &quot;implied Christians were homophobic&quot;. Ofcom confirmed on 13 April 2016 that Morgan would not be investigated for his comments. 

On 21 January 2020, Morgan was accused of racism and received 1,095 Ofcom complaints for his comments relating to a Chinese dairy advert in which he said &quot;He&#x27;s using ching chong ching milk&quot;. Morgan also spoke over the advert, saying &quot;ching chang cho jo&quot;. He was accused online of using language that is used to antagonise Chinese people and of mocking the Chinese language.

After receiving 41,015 complaints, Ofcom launched an investigation on 9 March 2021 into the remarks Morgan made about the Duchess of Sussex&#x27;s mental health on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;. The regulator confirmed on 12 March that the Duchess of Sussex had complained as well. On 17 March, it was reported that complaints against Morgan had reached 57,000, breaking Ofcom&#x27;s record. Morgan remained defiant, stating &quot;Only 57,000? I&#x27;ve had more people than that come up and congratulate me in the street for what I said. The vast majority of Britons are right behind me.&quot; Ofcom cleared ITV of any wrongdoing in September 2021 and added that restricting Morgan&#x27;s views would be a &quot;chilling restriction&quot; on freedom of speech but criticised his &quot;apparent disregard&quot; for the subject of suicide. Morgan described the ruling as &quot;a resounding victory for free speech and a resounding defeat for Princess Pinocchios.&quot;

===Feuds and banned television guests===
A feud between Morgan and A. A. Gill began when Morgan described Gill&#x27;s partner Nicola Formby as a sex kitten on whom the mists of time had taken their toll and said she had shown him &quot;porn shots&quot; of herself. Gill said Morgan had made this up and called him a &quot;pretty objectionable self-publicist&quot;.

In May 2011, Morgan banned actor Hugh Grant from his shows on CNN and ITV after Grant spoke out against the need for the tabloid press. On Twitter he responded: &quot;Hugh Grant is now banned, in perpetuity, from @PiersTonight and Life Stories and anything else I ever do. Tedious little man.&quot;

On 28 March 2012, MTV referred to the bad relations between Morgan and Madonna, reporting that &quot;Morgan has apparently felt slighted over the years by Madonna...he claims he was lied to by the singer&#x27;s publicist.&quot;

In September 2012, it was reported that Morgan had also banned actor Kelsey Grammer. Morgan himself said, &quot;Kelsey Grammer saw a photo of his ex-wife Camille in the open of our show and legged it.&quot; &quot;TVGuide&quot; reported, &quot;All plans were still a go for the segment until Grammer actually got in the hot seat and saw the footage the producers had planned to peg to the segment, including a picture of his ex-wife&quot;. On 26 September 2012, Fox 11 Los Angeles reported that &quot;many say [it] was an ambush by Piers&quot;. &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; reported that &quot;before the interview was scheduled, it was made clear that Grammer would answer all questions, including those about [his ex-wife]. His sole request was not to show any images of her.&quot;

On 4 February 2014, transgender advocate Janet Mock appeared as a guest on &quot;Piers Morgan Live&quot; to discuss her memoir, &quot;Redefining Realness&quot;. After the interview aired, Mock sent a series of tweets criticising Morgan for describing Mock as being &quot;formerly a man&quot;. Morgan responded that he had &quot;never been treated in such a disgraceful manner&quot; by a guest. On 5 February, Mock appeared as a guest again to debate the dispute.

Morgan has repeatedly clashed with actor John Cleese. In 2015, Cleese stated that he &quot;truly detested&quot; Morgan and had avoided him in a restaurant. He also said he thought Morgan was &quot;in jail&quot;, erroneously stating that Morgan had &quot;admitted&quot; to authorising phone-hacking. Morgan responded that the &quot;revulsion&quot; between them was &quot;mutual&quot;. When Cleese&#x27;s tweet about detesting Morgan became his most popular to date, Cleese said &quot;clearly I must insult the slimy, attention-seeking little prole more often&quot;. Morgan joked that he was glad to have been able to make Cleese &quot;popular again&quot;. In 2017, Cleese told &quot;Radio Times&quot;: &quot;I always thought he was an awful creep [...] I just didn&#x27;t want to have an encounter with him and since then he&#x27;s been after me and I&#x27;ve been after him.&quot;

Morgan strongly objected to the Women&#x27;s March on Washington on 21 January 2017, the day after Trump&#x27;s inauguration, describing protesters as &quot;rabid feminists&quot; and the multiple protests as being &quot;vacuous&quot;. The actor Ewan McGregor disagreed with Morgan&#x27;s statements on the Women&#x27;s March and pulled out of appearing on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; the following Tuesday after discovering Morgan would be interviewing him, along with Reid. Morgan accused McGregor of being a &quot;paedophile-loving hypocrite&quot; for his past support of Roman Polanski.

===&quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot;===
On 16 September 2021, News UK announced its new channel TalkTV would launch in 2022, with Morgan being the first name signed up. Morgan presented &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot; weeknights from 25 April 2022, the first and second episodes contained a new interview with Donald Trump. Within a week of the first broadcast, estimated audiences had declined by 80 percent, from 316,800 to 61,700 average viewers of Morgan&#x27;s show. On 7 March 2023, he won the Scoop of the Year award at the British Sports Journalism Awards for his interview with Cristiano Ronaldo in November 2022. In June 2023, he won the TRIC award for the Interview of The Year award for the same broadcast. In February 2024, Morgan announced that &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot; would no longer be broadcast on TalkTV and would instead be shown exclusively on YouTube.

==Personal life==
Morgan married Marion Shalloe, a hospital ward sister, in 1991. The couple had three sons, and separated in 2004 before divorcing in 2008. On 24 June 2010, he married his second wife, journalist Celia Walden, daughter of the former Conservative MP George Walden in Swinbrook, Oxfordshire. They have a daughter.

<doc id="555563" wikidata="Q1152244" url="?curid=555563" title="Council of State (Ireland)">
<text>The Council of State () is a body established by the Constitution of Ireland to advise the President of Ireland in the exercise of many of their discretionary, reserve powers. It also has authority to provide for the temporary exercise of the duties of the president if these cannot be exercised by either the president or the Presidential Commission (an eventuality that is very unlikely to occur, since it would require the simultaneous absence of the President and two members of the three-member Commission).

==Members==
The Council of State consists of a number of government officials, who sit , as well as certain former office holders and up to seven individuals of the president&#x27;s own choosing. The members comprise the attorney general as well as individuals from each of three branches of government: legislature, executive and judiciary.

Unlike most of the president&#x27;s other duties, which must be conducted in accordance with the advice of the cabinet, the seven presidential appointees to the Council of State are chosen at the president&#x27;s absolute discretion. These appointees retain their positions until the president&#x27;s successor takes office.

The Constitution explicitly states that members appointed by the President may resign, or be dismissed by the President. Former office holders are members if &quot;able and willing to act as a member&quot;, which implies an ability to resign; but there is no provision for dismissing them. When the McCracken Tribunal found in 1997 that former Taoiseach Charles Haughey had misled the Tribunal, there were calls for him to formally resign from the Council of State. He did not do so, although he sent his regrets to subsequent meetings of the council until his death.

Members of the Council of State may be excused from jury duty.

The Constitution specifies a declaration of office, &quot;in the presence of Almighty God&quot;, which a new member must take before attending an official meeting. Tánaiste Éamon Gilmore, a declared agnostic, sought legal advice before attending the 2013 Council meeting. The 1996 Constitutional Review Group recommended making the religious part optional.

==Role==
Before exercising any reserve power but one, the President is required to seek the advice of the Council of State, although not required to follow its advice. The one exception, where the President has &quot;absolute discretion&quot;, is in deciding to refuse a dissolution to a Taoiseach who has lost the confidence of the Dáil. The remaining discretionary powers, which do require prior consultation with the Council of State, are as follows (for a detailed description of the president&#x27;s reserve powers see: President of Ireland#Discretionary powers):
* Convening a meeting of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas
* Addressing the Oireachtas
* Addressing the Nation
* Establishing a committee of privileges to resolve a dispute between the Houses over a putative money bill
* Abridging the time for considering a bill in the Seanad
* Referring a bill to the Supreme Court to test its Constitutionality
* Referring a bill to the people for an &quot;ordinary referendum&quot;

The draft of the Constitution gave more powers to the Council of State. Article 13 allows additional powers to be given to the President acting on the advice of the Government; originally, it was the advice of the Council of State that was to be required. Article 14 provides for a Presidential Commission as the collective vice-presidency of the state when the President is absent; originally the Council of State was to fill this function. Nevertheless, under Article 14.4 of the constitution the Council of State, acting by a majority of its members, has the authority to &quot;make such provision as to them may seem meet&quot; for the exercise of the duties of the president in any contingency the constitution does not foresee. This provision has never been invoked.

The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, which was defeated at a referendum, gave a role to the Council of State in the work of an envisaged constituency boundary commission.

Close to the time of its inception, the Council of State was likened to a privy council, although Jim Duffy calls this &quot;more apparent than real&quot; as it has no legislative or judicial functions. Gemma Hussey, who was a member of the Council of State in 1989–90, described it as &quot;largely a symbolic body&quot;. Actress Siobhán McKenna, appointed to the council by Patrick Hillery, suggested in the 1980s that the Council approach Ronald Reagan regarding the Troubles in Northern Ireland; Hillery&#x27;s secretary remarked there was &quot;no point in trying to explain&quot; to McKenna that the council had no role in such matters.

== Meetings ==
Working meetings called by the President for consultation under the terms of the Constitution are rare, though less so since the election of Mary Robinson in 1990. Four meetings have related to an address the Oireachtas, which requires the approval of the Government as well as the consultation of the Council of State. All other meetings have been to advise the President about whether to refer a bill to the Supreme Court.

Meetings are held in Áras an Uachtaráin. Members arrive 15 minutes before the meeting starts, and are served light refreshments in the Council of State Room. At the first meeting of the Council in Mary McAleese&#x27;s first term, there was a photocall in the State Reception Rooms. Members are seated in order of precedence in the Presidents&#x27; Room around a 1927 dining table purchased by President de Valera in 1961. The Secretary-General to the President serves as clerk to the council. The Council does not offer collective advice; the President asks each member in turn to comment, and further discussion may involve several members. No vote or show of hands is taken. 

The council&#x27;s deliberations are held in camera, as for cabinet meetings, though there is no explicit requirement for confidentiality. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; obtained details of a 1984 meeting from an unnamed attendee, while James Dooge discussed a 1976 meeting years later with journalist Stephen Collins. A 2019 legal request under the EU directive on public access to environmental information for records of 1999 and 2002 council meetings was rejected by the Supreme Court in 2022, on the grounds that the President&#x27;s constitutional immunity from court or Oireachtas scrutiny extended to the Council in its role as advisor to the President.

Apart from the Council of State&#x27;s official meetings, its members are invited to important state functions, such as state funerals, the National Day of Commemoration, and the inauguration of the next President. The first President, Douglas Hyde, dined monthly with the members of his Council of State. The seven new presidential nominees of Mary McAleese&#x27;s second term were introduced at a luncheon in the Áras the month after their appointment. Campaigning in the 1990 presidential election, Mary Robinson promised to have meetings of the Council regularly rather than on &quot;an emergency basis&quot;.

===Addresses to the Oireachtas===


===Referring of bills===
In some cases, the President has decided to sign the bill (thereby enacting it) without referring it to the Supreme Court; in other cases, the President has referred the bill (or sections of it) and the court has upheld its constitutionality, and in other cases the Court has found some or all of the referred portions to be unconstitutional. It is not revealed whether some or all members of the Council of State counselled for or against the President&#x27;s course of action.

Jim Duffy in 1991 criticised the lack of supporting resources for members of the council; at meetings, they were provided only with a copy of the Constitution. By contrast, prior to the 2013 meeting to discuss the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill, a dossier of background information was sent to each member, including legal briefs and news reports.

Although the serving Chief Justice is a member of the council, by convention they do not get involved in substantive discussions on the bill, as they will be involved in the deliberations if the bill does get referred. Therefore, retired Chief Justices and the President of the High Court play a greater role in the discussion. The 2013 meeting was the first at which two serving members of the Supreme Court were present: the term of the Chief Justice was limited to seven years in 1997, and ex-Chief Justice John Murray remained an ordinary member of the Court.

An act which has passed an Article 26 review cannot subsequently have its constitutionality impugned. Jurists have argued this is dangerous, since an Article 26 review can only consider raise hypothetical issues for consideration, and if an unconsidered issue arises later in a real-world case, a judicial review declaration of unconstitutionality is no longer available as a remedy. President Higgins alluded to this argument when he signed the Planning and Development Act 2024 without consulting the Council of State: he noted doubts about the bill&#x27;s constitutionality, but said they were &quot;probably best tested in a facts specific way rather than in the abstract&quot;.

<text>Robert Abbe (April 13, 1851 – March 7, 1928) was an American surgeon and pioneer radiologist in New York City. He was born in New York City and educated at the College of the City of New York (S.B., 1871) and Columbia University (M.D., 1874).

Abbe was most known as a plastic surgeon, and between 1877 and 1884 he served as a surgeon and professor of surgery at New York Hospital, St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, and New York Babies Hospital. During this time, he would spend summers travelling, and he amassed a large collection of Native American artifacts and archeological materials.

He is credited with the lip switch flap, which now bears his name. An Italian surgeon named Sabattini described the flap 60 years earlier. Although Sabattini published his technique, it was printed in a book with a limited circulation.

He died of anemia, possibly due to his work handling radium.

==Radiologist==
Abbe was a renowned surgeon and medical pioneer. He was an attending surgeon at Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West) in New York, where the plastic surgical laboratory is named for him. He was a lecturer and fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and Vice President of the Academy of Medicine.

He befriended the Curies, and in particular Marie Curie. He collected many photographs of her, documented the production of radium, and explored, with her, the medical uses of radiation and x-rays. In 1904, he introduced the practice of using radiation to treat cancer and founded the science of radiation oncology. In 1927, he founded the Abbe Museum of Native American artifacts.

In 1904, after corresponding with Professor and Madame Curie, he visited their laboratories in Paris. Joining in their groundbreaking research, he became the founder of radiation therapy in the United States. He was a vigorous opponent of the use of tobacco which he considered a cause of cancer and reported over 100 cases of smoker&#x27;s cancer. In later years, at his Bar Harbor summer home, &quot;Brook End,&quot; Abbe created a garden in whose pool floated two swans – Pierre and Marie.

==Museum==

Abbe has been called &quot;the best-loved summer resident of Bar Harbor.&quot; Those who knew him recognized his unique spirit, and many who visit the Museum today feel the specialness of the man and the museum. 

While summering in Bar Harbor, Abbe was fascinated by the ancient Native American tools found in nearby shell heaps. As he began collecting these artifacts, he realized the need for safe permanent storage. Even during a long illness, probably a result of his exposure to radium, he labored to establish the museum.
His dreams of a museum became reality with the help of friends such as George Dorr and Charles Eliot, the founding fathers of Acadia National Park. The dedication of the museum on August 14, 1928, was also a memorial to Robert Abbe. He had died just five months before.

Abbe amassed a sizeable collection of Native American archaeological material during his summers on Mount Desert Island. Opened in 1928, the Abbe was one of the first museums built in Maine. Its founding coincided with that of the national park, which was established as Lafayette National Park in 1919 and became Acadia in 1929. The Abbe was conceived as a trailside museum to complement the park&#x27;s offerings. Today it is one of only two remaining private trailside museums in national parks, the other one being the Borax Museum in Death Valley, California.
Robert Abbe was a man of many talents and interests. He was a photographer and an artist, painting, creating line drawings and molded maps. His large map &quot;The Land of Dawn&quot; is on display in the museum. The watercolor sketch on the right, of the museum, was completed by Abbe shortly before his death.

==Family==
Abbe was the brother of Cleveland Abbe, and the uncle of Cleveland Abbe Jr. and Truman Abbe.

<doc id="555566" wikidata="Q6245111" url="?curid=555566" title="On the Sublime">
<text>On the Sublime ( ; ) is a Roman-era Greek work of literary criticism dated to the 1st century AD. Its author is unknown but is conventionally referred to as Longinus (; ) or Pseudo-Longinus. It is regarded as a classic work on aesthetics and the effects of good writing. The treatise highlights examples of good and bad writing from the previous millennium, focusing particularly on what may lead to the sublime.

==Authorship ==
The author is unknown. In a 10th-century reference manuscript (Parisinus Graecus 2036), the heading (f. 178v) reports &quot;by Dionysius Longinus&quot; (), whereas in the table of contents at f. 1v, the same copyist wrote &quot;by Dionysius or Longinus&quot; (). When the manuscript was being prepared for printed publication, the work was initially attributed to Cassius Longinus (). Since the correct translation includes the possibility of an author named &quot;Dionysius&quot;, some have attributed the work to Dionysius of Halicarnassus or Dionysius Atticus, both writers of the 1st century BC. There remains the possibility that the work belongs to neither Cassius Longinus nor either Dionysius but, rather, some unknown author writing under the Roman Empire, likely in the 1st century. The error does imply that when the codex was written, the trails of the real author were already lost. Neither author can be accepted as the actual writer of the treatise. Dionysius maintained ideas which are absolutely opposite to those written in the treatise; with Longinus, there are problems with chronology.

Among further names proposed, are Hermagoras of Temnos (a rhetorician who lived in Rome during the 1st century AD), Aelius Theon (author of a work which had many ideas in common with those of &quot;On the Sublime&quot;), and Pompeius Geminus (who was in epistolary conversation with Dionysius).

===Dionysius of Halicarnassus===
Dionysius of Halicarnassus wrote under Augustus, publishing a number of works. Dionysius is generally dismissed as the potential author of &quot;On the Sublime&quot;, since the writing officially attributed to Dionysius differs from the work &quot;On the Sublime&quot; in style and thought.

===Cassius Longinus===
Credited with writing a number of literary works, Longinus was a disciple of Plotinus, and considered &quot;the most distinguished scholar of his day.&quot; He received his education at Alexandria and then went to Athens to teach. He later moved to Asia Minor, where he achieved the position of advisor to Zenobia, the queen of Palmyra. Cassius is a dubious possibility for author of the treatise because he wrote in the 3rd century, and no literature later than the 1st century AD is mentioned. The latest is Cicero, who died in 43 BC and their work is now dated to the early 1st century AD. The work ends with a dissertation on the decay of oratory, a typical subject for the time when authors such as Tacitus, Petronius and Quintilian, who also dealt with the subject, were alive. Cassius was executed by Aurelian, the Roman emperor who conquered Palmyra in 273 AD, on charges of conspiring against the Roman state. This was most likely because of what he had written for Queen Zenobia of Palmyra while she was still in power. Longinus is reported to have written answers for the Queen, which were used in response to Aurelian, the man who would soon rise to power as the Roman emperor.

=== Dionysius Longinus ===
According to Byzantinist Carlo Maria Mazzucchi, editor of the text, &quot;Dionysius Longinus&quot; is the true name of the author. He argued that the combination of the &quot;nomen&quot; &quot;Dionysius&quot; and the &quot;cognomen&quot; &quot;Longinus&quot; is acceptable on the basis of several ancient sources, and that the perplexities shown by the manuscript&#x27;s copyist are due to the fact that no other rhetor is known under the name of &quot;Dionysius Longinus&quot;; thus the copyist compiled the manuscript index adding the disjunctive ἤ (&quot;or&quot;), thinking of well-known Ancient Greek rhetors Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Cassius Longinus.

==Contents==
&quot;On the Sublime&quot; is both a treatise on aesthetics and a work of literary criticism. It is written in an epistolary form and the final part, possibly dealing with public speaking, has been lost.

The treatise is dedicated to Postumius Terentianus, a cultured Roman and public figure, though little else is known of him. &quot;On the Sublime&quot; is a compendium of literary exemplars, with about 50 authors spanning 1,000 years mentioned or quoted. Along with the expected examples from Homer and other figures of Greek culture, Longinus refers to a passage from &quot;Genesis&quot;, which is quite unusual for the 1st century:

Given his positive reference to Genesis, Longinus has been assumed to be either a Hellenized Jew or readily familiar with the Jewish culture. As such, Longinus emphasizes that, to be a truly great writer, authors must have &quot;moral excellence&quot;. In fact, critics speculate that Longinus avoided publication in the ancient world &quot;either by modesty or by prudential motives&quot;. Moreover, Longinus stresses that transgressive writers are not necessarily shameless fools, even if they take literary risks that seem &quot;bold, lawless, and original&quot;. As for social subjectivity, Longinus acknowledges that complete liberty promotes spirit and hope; according to Longinus, &quot;never did a slave become an orator&quot;. On the other hand, too much luxury and wealth leads to a decay in eloquence—eloquence being the goal of the sublime writer.

===The sublime===
Longinus critically applauds and condemns certain literary works as examples of good or bad styles of writing. Longinus ultimately promotes an &quot;elevation of style&quot; and an essence of &quot;simplicity&quot;. To quote this famous author, &quot;the first and most important source of sublimity [is] the power of forming great conceptions.&quot; The concept of the sublime is generally accepted to refer to a style of writing that elevates itself &quot;above the ordinary&quot;. Finally, Longinus sets out five sources of sublimity: &quot;great thoughts, strong emotions, certain figures of thought and speech, noble diction, and dignified word arrangement&quot;.

The effects of the Sublime are: loss of rationality, an alienation leading to identification with the creative process of the artist and a deep emotion mixed in pleasure and exaltation. An example of sublime (which the author quotes in the work) is a poem by Sappho, the so-called &quot;Ode to Jealousy&quot;, defined as a &quot;Sublime ode&quot;. A writer&#x27;s goal is not so much to express empty feelings, but to arouse emotion in her audience.

In the treatise, the author asserts that &quot;the Sublime leads the listeners not to persuasion, but to ecstasy: for what is wonderful always goes together with a sense of dismay, and prevails over what is only convincing or delightful, since persuasion, as a rule, is within everyone&#x27;s grasp: whereas, the Sublime, giving to speech an invincible power and [an invincible] strength, rises above every listener&quot;.

According to this statement, one could think that the sublime, for Longinus, was only a moment of evasion from reality. But on the contrary, he thought that literature could model a soul, and that a soul could pour itself out into a work of art. In this way the treatise becomes not only a text of literary inquiry, but also one of ethical dissertation, since the Sublime becomes the product of a &quot;great soul&quot; (, &quot;megalophrosunēs apēchēma&quot;). The sources of the Sublime are of two kinds: inborn sources (&quot;aspiration to vigorous concepts&quot; and &quot;strong and enthusiastic passion&quot;) and acquirable sources (rhetorical devices, choice of the right lexicon, and &quot;dignified and high composition&quot;).

===Decay of rhetoric===
The author speaks also about the decay of oratory, as arising not only from absence of political freedom but also from the corruption of morals, which together destroy that high spirit which generates the Sublime. Thus the treatise is clearly centred in the burning controversy which raged in the 1st century AD in Latin literature. If Petronius pointed out excess of rhetoric and the pompous, unnatural techniques of the schools of eloquence as the causes of decay, Tacitus was nearer to Longinus in thinking that the root of this decadence was the establishment of Princedom, or Empire, which, though it brought stability and peace, also gave rise to censorship and brought an end to freedom of speech. Thus oratory became merely an exercise in style.

===Misleading translations and lost data===
Translators have been unable to clearly interpret the text, including the title itself. The &quot;sublime&quot; in the title has been translated in various ways, to include senses of elevation and excellent style. The word sublime, argues Rhys Roberts, is misleading, since Longinus&#x27; objective broadly concerns &quot;the essentials of a noble and impressive style&quot; than anything more narrow and specific. Moreover, about one-third of the treatise is missing; Longinus&#x27; segment on similes, for instance, has only a few words remaining. Matters are further complicated in realizing that ancient writers, Longinus&#x27; contemporaries, do not quote or mention the treatise in any way.

===Limitations of the writing===
Despite Longinus&#x27; acclaim, not all critical reception has been positive. 18th-century critic Edward Burnaby Greene finds Longinus, at times, to be &quot;too refined&quot;. Greene also claims that Longinus&#x27; focus on hyperbolical descriptions is &quot;particularly weak, and apparently misapplied.&quot; Occasionally, Longinus also falls into a sort of &quot;tediousness&quot; in treating his subjects. The treatise is also limited in its concentration on spiritual transcendence and lack of focus on the way in which language structures determine the feelings and thoughts of writers. Finally, Longinus&#x27; treatise is difficult to explain in an academic setting, given the difficulty of the text and lack of &quot;practical rules of a teachable kind.&quot;

===Writing style and rhetoric===
Despite its faults, the treatise remains critically successful because of its &quot;noble tone,&quot; &quot;apt precepts,&quot; &quot;judicious attitude,&quot; and &quot;historical interests&quot;. One of the reasons why it is so unlikely that known ancient critics wrote &quot;On the Sublime&quot; is because the treatise is composed so differently from any other literary work. Since Longinus&#x27; rhetorical formula avoids dominating his work, the literature remains &quot;personal and fresh,&quot; unique in its originality. Longinus rebels against the popular rhetoric of the time by implicitly attacking ancient theory in its focus on a detailed criticism of words, metaphors, and figures. More explicitly, in refusing to judge tropes as entities unto themselves, Longinus promotes the appreciation of literary devices as they relate to passages as a whole. Essentially, Longinus, rare for a critic of his time, focuses more on &quot;greatness of style&quot; than &quot;technical rules.&quot; Despite his criticism of ancient texts, Longinus remains a &quot;master of candor and good-nature&quot;. Moreover, the author invents striking images and metaphors, writing almost lyrically at times. In general, Longinus appreciates, and makes use of, simple diction and bold images.

As far as the language is concerned, the work is certainly a unicum because it is a blend of expressions of the Hellenistic Koine Greek to which are added elevated constructions, technical expressions, metaphors, classic and rare forms which produce a literary pastiche at the borders of linguistic experimentation.

===Influences===
In reading &quot;On the Sublime&quot;, critics have determined that the ancient philosopher and writer Plato is a &quot;great hero&quot; to Longinus. Not only does Longinus come to Plato&#x27;s defense, but he also attempts to raise his literary standing in opposition to current criticisms. Another influence on the treatise can be found in Longinus&#x27; rhetorical figures, which draw from theories by a 1st-century BC writer, Caecilius of Calacte.

==Historical criticism and use of &quot;On the Sublime&quot;==
*10th century - The original treatise, before translation, is copied into a medieval manuscript and attributed to &quot;Dionysius or Longinus.&quot;
*13th century - A Byzantine rhetorician makes obscure references to what may be Longinus&#x27; text.
*16th century - The treatise is ignored by scholars until it is published by Francis Robortello in Basel, in 1554, and Niccolò da Falgano, in 1560. The original work is attributed to &quot;Dionysius Longinus&quot; and most European countries receive translations of the treatise.
*17th century - Sublime effects become a desired end of much Baroque art and literature, and the rediscovered work of &quot;Longinus&quot; goes through half a dozen editions in the 17th century. It is Boileau&#x27;s 1674 translation of the treatise into French that really starts its career in the history of criticism. Despite its popularity, some critics claim that the treatise was too &quot;primitive&quot; to be truly understood by a &quot;too civilized&quot; 17th-century audience.
*18th century - William Smith&#x27;s 1739 translation of &quot;Longinus on the Sublime&quot; established the translator and once more brought the work into prominence. Longinus&#x27; text reaches its height in popularity. In England, critics esteem Longinus&#x27; principles of composition and balance second only to Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;. Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful&quot; and Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of the Power of Judgment&quot; owe a debt to Longinus&#x27; concept of the sublime, and the category passes into intellectual discourse. As &quot;Longinus&quot; says, &quot;The effect of elevated language upon an audience is not persuasion but transport,&quot; a fitting sentiment for Romantic thinkers and writers who reach beyond logic, to the wellsprings of the Sublime. At the same time, the Romantics gain some contempt for Longinus, given his association with the &quot;rules&quot; of classical poets. Such contempt is ironic, given the widespread influence of Longinus on the shaping of 18th-century criticism.
*19th century - Early in the 19th century, doubts arise to the authorship of the treatise. Thanks to Italian scholar Amati, Cassius Longinus is no longer assumed to be the writer of &quot;On the Sublime&quot;. Simultaneously, the critical popularity of Longinus&#x27; work diminishes greatly; though the work is still in use by scholars, it is rarely quoted. Despite the lack of public enthusiasm, editions and translations of &quot;On the Sublime&quot; are published at the end of the century.
*20th century - Although the text is still little quoted, it maintains its status, apart from Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, as &quot;the most delightful of all the critical works of classical antiquity.&quot; Also see Neil Hertz&#x27;s essay on Longinus in his book, &quot;The End of the Line.&quot; Hertz is in part responding to Thomas Weiskel&#x27;s book &quot;The Romantic Sublime&quot;, probably the most influential recent account of British and German Romantic attitudes towards the Sublime of both Burke and Longinus. Laura Quinney treats the attractions grim demystification in analyses of Longinus, particularly Weiskel&#x27;s. Jonathan Culler has an appreciation of Hertz on Longinus in &quot;The Hertzian Sublime.&quot; Anne Carson and Louis Marin have occasion to discuss Longinus as well and Harold Bloom and William J. Kennedy have significant accounts of his work. William Carlos Williams also uses three lines from the work as an epigraph to the Prologue to Kora in Hell. The text is also critically edited and extensively commented, most notably by D. A. Russell and Carlo Maria Mazzucchi.

German film director Werner Herzog claims to have an affinity with the work of Longinus, in a talk entitled &quot;On the Absolute, the Sublime and Ecstatic Truth&quot;, presented in Milan. Herzog says that he thinks of Longinus as a good friend and considers that Longinus&#x27;s notions of illumination has a parallel in some moments in his films. He quotes from Longinus: &quot;For our soul is raised out of nature through the truly sublime, sways with high spirits, and is filled with proud joy, as if itself had created what it hears.&quot;

<text>The Higher Education and Training Awards Council () (HETAC), the legal successor to the &quot;National Council for Educational Awards&quot; (NCEA), granted higher education awards in Ireland beyond the university system from 2001 to 2012. HETAC was created in 2001, subject to the policies of the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, and, specifically, granted qualifications at many Institutes of Technology and other colleges. HETAC was dissolved and its functions were passed to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) on 6 November 2012.

==History==
===NCEA===

In 1967 the Steering Committee on Technical Education recommended the creation of a body to control non-university higher qualifications, and in 1969 the Higher Education Authority similarly recommended the establishment of a &quot;Council for National Awards&quot; to better organise the non-university higher education sector; the HEA recommendations were tentative, to be refined after application to the work of the newly-established National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick. Following these recommendations, the National Council for Educational Awards (NCEA) was founded in April 1972 on an ad-hoc basis. The Minister for Education, Padraig Faulkner, specified its terms of reference, including the promotion and coordination of industrial, professional, commercial and scientific education, and the conferring of certificates, diplomas and degrees. The NCEA granted the first National Certificates, 93 in number, in 1972; these were awarded at five Regional Technical Colleges. The NCEA granted its first bachelor degrees, to four students in Physical Education, in 1974.

Early on it was decided that the NCEA would be the only extra-university award-conferring institution in the State for higher education, rather than having a multitude of competing institutions, with authority to grant awards at all academic levels including degree level. Hence it was the award-granting body for NIHE Limerick, for example. Despite this, the Fine Gael-Labour (National Coalition) government limited the NCEA to sub-degree awards only from early 1976, and the later Fianna Fáil government of 1977 restored its full powers in November 1977, and placed the NCEA on a statutory footing in 1980 by commencing the National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979.

In 1982 the first master&#x27;s degree is awarded at NIHE Limerick in Arts, Business Studies and Engineering, and in 1985 the first doctorate degree was awarded at NIHE Dublin.

The founding director of the National Council for Educational Awards was Padraig Mac Diarmada, whose educational vision and philosophy contributed to further development of higher and continuing education in Ireland and whose vision enabled students to attain educational qualifications which would never have been envisioned by them prior to 1972. The last director (CEO) of the council was former Holy Trinity NS (Donaghmede) national school teacher and former INTO President Séamus Puirséil (Seamus Purcell).

===Establishment of HETAC===
HETAC was created in 2001 under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999 (Section 21). It inherited the work of the NCEA, validating and awarding qualifications up to degree level, for the institutes of technology and a wide range of third-level institutions.

The first chief executive of HETAC was the former head of the NCEA, Seamus Puirseil. He was succeeded in 2008 by Gearóid Ó Conluain, formerly Deputy Chief Inspector of Department of Education and Science.

===Merger into QQI===
In October 2008 the Irish Government announced its intention to amalgamate HETAC with FETAC and NQAI, the two other bodies established under the Qualifications Act, while also incorporating the functions for the external review of Irish universities then carried out by the Irish Universities Quality Board. HETAC was dissolved and Quality and Qualifications Ireland came into being on November 6th 2012.

==Awards==
In 2004 HETAC completed the transition from awards derived from the NCEA standards to a new awards system based on the National Framework of Qualifications. A rough correspondence between the awards of the two systems is shown below.

==Recognised institutions==
The providers of courses which lead to HETAC awards were called &quot;recognised institutions&quot;, recognised under the Qualifications (Education &amp; Training) Act, 1999 (Section 24). Some of these institutions were granted &quot;delegation of authority&quot; (often referred to as &quot;delegated authority&quot;) which allowed them to make HETAC awards in their own name, this was limited to the Institutes of Technology and often to certain award levels at certain institutions.

<doc id="555583" wikidata="Q385137" url="?curid=555583" title="World Assembly of Muslim Youth">
<text>The World Assembly of Muslim Youth is an international Islamic educational organization whose stated purpose is &quot;preserve the identity of Muslim youth and help overcome the problems they face in modern society&quot;. Reportedly the world&#x27;s largest Muslim organization, WAMY organizes conferences, symposia, educational workshops and research circles to address youth and students issues, in addition to football tournaments and European Muslim Scouts camps for Muslim youth in Europe. Along with the Muslim World League, it is part of a &quot;worldwide network of largely Saudi-funded groups...promoting Islamic teachings and encouraging Muslims to be more religiously observant, as well as providing interested non-Muslims and recent converts with information about Islam&quot;. It maintains satellite chapters in 31 other countries and is affiliated with some 196 other Muslim youth groups on five continents.

==History==
WAMY was founded in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 1972 and has offices in countries with significant Muslim populations throughout the world. WAMY was co-founded by Muslim Brotherhood member Kamal Helwabi and Abdullah bin Laden, nephew of al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden. Abdullah bin Laden served as president through 2002, and was later treasurer. Abdullah also incorporated WAMY&#x27;s U.S branch at Falls Church, Virginia in 1992. Kamal Helwabi went on to serve as WAMY&#x27;s executive director until 1982.

According to the Pew Research Center, between the 1970s and 1990s, the activities of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Muslim World League and the World Assembly of Muslim Youth in Europe became &quot;so intertwined that it was often difficult to tell them apart&quot;. It further notes that the influence of WAMY and MWL has waned somewhat as social media and blogs have &quot;made it easier for other groups to reach wide audiences&quot;. Books favoured by the organization during the 1980s-90s included works by Islamist authors Sayyid Qutb, Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, and Muhammad Qutb.

==Aims==
WAMY&#x27;s South African branch aims &quot;to preserve the Muslim identity, to help overcome the problems Muslim youth face in modern society&quot;, and to &quot;educate and train Muslim youth in order for them to become active and positive citizens in their countries&quot;. WAMY aims to introduce Islam to non-Muslims in its &quot;purest form as a comprehensive system and way of life&quot; and &quot;to establish a relationship of dialogue, understanding and appreciation between other faith organizations&quot;.

It organizes conferences, symposia, workshops and research circles to address youth and students issues. WAMY publishes material that introduces Islam to non-Muslims. WAMY organizes exchange visits, Hajj and Umrah trips and provide training and support to Muslim youth organizations.

The website of WAMY&#x27;s UK branch states their aim to &quot;build bridges of peace and unity in our multicultural society. ...Through educating the Muslim youth to the common good and promoting understanding among people of different communities.&quot;

Both the Muslim World League and WAMY are widely seen to be promoting the strict Wahhabi interpretation of Islam prevalent in Saudi Arabia, due to Saudi funding and influence on it.

==Controversy==

An affidavit signed by one Customs Senior Special Agent David C. Kane stated that a WAMY publication lists people who have attacked Israelis, including a man who killed 14 people by driving a bus off a cliff, as &quot;Heroes from Palestine&quot;. Kane writes that a section of that publication, titled &quot;Animosity Toward the Jews&quot;, lists reasons for Muslims to hate Jews, including, &quot;The Jews are humanity&#x27;s enemies: they foment immorality in this world.&quot;

In May 2004, 50 FBI, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Joint Terrorism Task Force agents raided WAMY&#x27;s office in the United States at Alexandria, Virginia. WAMY issued a statement saying that all of its computers and hard drives were seized in the raid, and a volunteer board member, Ibrahim Abdullah, was arrested on immigration charges. In a statement, WAMY strongly denied any terrorist ties and said the government had told them the probe is focused only on &quot;immigration issues&quot;. The branch was closed by the US government.

The Albanian WAMY branch, founded 1993, was raided in 1999 and suspected terrorist elements were deported. Saudi support for the new leadership continued after the event. Founded with the aim of constructing mosques and providing humanitarian aid, the branch was active in bringing Salafi and Wahabi ideology to Albania, recruiting and sending Albanians to study Salafi and Wahabi theology in Saudi Arabia.

The Indian government has accused the assistant General Secretary of WAMY, Nazir Qureshi of supporting terrorist groups in Kashmir. The Peshawar branch of WAMY was raided in a joint operation by the FBI and Pakistani intelligence.

<doc id="555584" wikidata="Q1478949" url="?curid=555584" title="Green Jellÿ">
<text>Green Jellÿ (, &quot;green Jell-O&quot;) is an American comedy rock band formed in 1981. Originally named Green Jellö, the band changed its name due to legal pressure from Kraft Foods Inc., the owners of the Jell-O brand, who claimed that it was an infringement of their trademark.

Known for sophomoric humor, theatrical performances, and intentionally crude musicianship, Green Jellÿ has had hundreds of members during its existence, with vocalist Bill Manspeaker the only consistent member throughout. Notable past members include Danny Carey and Maynard James Keenan, who were both in Green Jellÿ during the early 1990s and went on to form Tool.

To date, the band has released five studio albums: &quot;Triple Live Möther Gööse at Budokan&quot; (1989), &quot;Cereal Killer Soundtrack&quot; (1993), &quot;333&quot; (1994), &quot;Musick to Insult Your Intelligence By&quot; (2009), and &quot;Garbage Band Kids&quot; (2021). They are best known for their 1992 hit &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;, which was adapted from the fairy tale.

==History==
===Beginnings (1981–1984)===
Bill Manspeaker formed Green Jellö, a four-piece comedy-punk band, in 1981. As most of the band&#x27;s members were poor musicians at the time, they billed themselves as &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Band&quot;.

===&quot;Let It Be&quot; (1984–1987)===
In 1984, Green Jellö released &quot;Let It Be&quot;, an eight-song EP, on their own label, American Jello Parti Productions, Inc. The cover artwork (designed by Manspeaker) was a parody of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; album cover. Recorded in Manspeaker&#x27;s bedroom and at a local band rehearsal hall, the album featured the &quot;Green Jellö Theme Song&quot; as well as early songs such as &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Poo-Poo on My Shoe&quot; (later called &quot;Shitman&quot;), &quot;Whip Me Teenage Babe&quot; (later renamed &quot;House Me Teenage Rave&quot;), &quot;Hill, Hill&quot;, &quot;Do the Howie&quot;, the one-second &quot;Icrog&quot;, &quot;The Ice Cream Song&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ll Buy You Any Major Appliance You Want Baby, Ooo Ooo&quot;.

===&quot;Triple Live Möther Gööse at Budokan&quot; (1987–1991)===
In 1989, Green Jellö released their second album, &quot;Triple Live Möther Gööse at Budokan&quot;, on February 29 Records, which was recorded in a garage with producer Sylvia Massy.

===&quot;Cereal Killer&quot; (1991–1993)===
In 1991, Green Jellö approached BMG subsidiary label Zoo Entertainment with a video-only album concept. In the fall of 1992, they delivered their third album, &quot;Cereal Killer&quot;, again produced by Massy. The album is a long-form video consisting of music videos for each song, as well as a behind-the-scenes feature. Zoo eventually issued the EP &quot;Green Jellö SUXX&quot;, consisting of four songs from &quot;Cereal Killer&quot;, including &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot;. The band then issued the full-length studio album &quot;Cereal Killer Soundtrack&quot; in March 1993. This was their first release under the revised name Green Jellÿ.

The video for &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; was directed by Fred Stuhr (who also directed Tool&#x27;s &quot;Sober&quot; video), and it featured a claymation rendition of the classic fairy tale with modern twists, such as pot-smoking pigs, an appearance by Rambo, and a Harley Davidson-riding wolf. The video was No. 17 for most of the summer of 1993 in the US and received both an MTV music award and Billboard music award nomination. The song entered the UK Singles Chart at a peak position of No. 5. &quot;Cereal Killer Soundtrack&quot; attained gold status in the US, New Zealand, and Canada, as well as platinum in Australia. In 1993, they released the single &quot;Electric Harley House (of Love)&quot;, with the video featuring Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley from KISS. Later the same year, the band released a single that was never included on any of their full-length albums: a collaboration with Hulk Hogan, performing Gary Glitter&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m the Leader of the Gang (I Am)&quot;, which became a Top-40 hit in the UK.

===&quot;333&quot; (1994–1995)===
In 1994, Green Jellÿ opened Green Jellÿ Studios, an audiovisual production house to create music videos for other artists, as well as pieces for television and film. The same year, the band recorded and filmed their fourth album, &quot;333&quot;. The record featured differing styles, from thrash metal to grunge rock to dance music. It failed to chart, although the single &quot;The Bear Song&quot; appeared in the Farrelly Brothers film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;. The related video album received a 1995 Grammy nomination for best long-form video.

Also in 1994, Green Jellÿ wrote and produced the soundtrack for the Acclaim Entertainment video game &quot;Spider-Man &amp; Venom: Maximum Carnage&quot;. The soundtrack is a computerized rendition of original songs.

===Reunion and &quot;Musick to Insult Your Intelligence By&quot; (2008–2009)===
On February 19, 2008, music news website Blabbermouth.net announced that Green Jellÿ was reuniting and that a possible US tour was in the works. The band also re-released the &quot;Cereal Killer&quot; and &quot;333&quot; video albums on a self-produced DVD with Originology Records, which were only sold at concerts. They released a new record, &quot;Musick to Insult Your Intelligence By&quot;, on October 13, 2009.

===Touring and new releases (2010–present)===
Green Jellÿ released a DVD on December 1, 2016, titled &quot;GREEN JELLO Suxx Live: An Experience in Ridiculousness&quot; (later retitled &quot;Green Jellÿ Suxx Live: An Experience in Ridiculousness&quot;). They toured throughout 2017 in support of the film and its soundtrack. In 2018, &quot;The Official Soundtrack of the Documentary Green Jellÿ Suxx Live&quot; was released via Enjoy the Ride Records.

In 2017, Green Jellÿ released a new music video and single, &quot;Fr3tö F33t&quot;. In 2018, they issued their first Christmas song, &quot;Green Jellÿ Xmas&quot;. In 2019, they released another single, titled &quot;Silence of the Sponge&quot;, a macabre parody of the theme to &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;.

Green Jellÿ&#x27;s fifth studio album, titled &quot;Garbage Band Kids&quot;, was released on June 11, 2021, on Cleopatra Records.

<doc id="555585" wikidata="Q2261974" url="?curid=555585" title="Demogorgon">
<text>Demogorgon is a deity or demon associated with the underworld. Although often ascribed to Greek mythology, the name probably arises from an unknown copyist&#x27;s misreading of a commentary by a fourth-century scholar, Lactantius Placidus. The concept itself can be traced back to the original misread term demiurge.

==Etymology==
The origins of the name &quot;Demogorgon&quot; are not entirely clear, though the most prevalent scholarly view now considers it to be a misreading of the Greek δημιουργόν (&quot;dēmiourgón&quot;, accusative case form of δημιουργός, &#x27;demiurge&#x27;) based on the manuscript variations in the earliest known explicit reference in Lactantius Placidus (Jahnke 1898, Sweeney 1997, Solomon 2012). Boccaccio, in his influential &quot;Genealogia Deorum Gentilium&quot;, cites a now-lost work by Theodontius and that master&#x27;s acknowledged Byzantine source &quot;Pronapides the Athenian&quot; as authority for the idea that Demogorgon is the antecedent of all the gods. Art historian Jean Seznec concludes that &quot;Demogorgon is a grammatical error, become god.&quot;

The name variants cited by Ricardus Jahnke include the Latin &quot;demoirgon&quot;, &quot;emoirgon&quot;, &quot;demogorgona&quot;, &quot;demogorgon&quot;, with the first critical editor Friedrich Lindenbrog (Fridericus Tiliobroga) having conjectured &quot;δημιουργόν&quot; as the prototype in 1600. Various other theories suggest that the name is derived from a combination of the Greek words δαίμων &quot;daimon&quot; (&#x27;spirit&#x27; given the Christian connotations of &#x27;demon&#x27; in the early Middle Ages)—or, less likely δῆμος &quot;dêmos&quot; (&quot;people&quot;)—and γοργός &quot;gorgós&quot; (&quot;quick&quot;) or Γοργών &quot;Gorgṓn&quot;, the monsters of Ancient Greek mythology first attested in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;.

==Derivation and history==
Demogorgon is first mentioned in the commentary on Statius&#x27;s &quot;Thebaid&quot; often attributed in manuscripts to a Lactantius Placidus, (c. 350–400 AD). The Lactantius Placidus commentary became the most common medieval commentary on the poem by Statius and is transmitted in most early editions up to 1600. The commentary has been attributed incorrectly to a different Lactantius, the Christian author Lucius Caelius Firmianus Lactantius, even though the commentator appears to have been Mithraic.

The name &quot;Demogorgon&quot; is introduced in a discussion of &quot;Thebaid&quot; 4.516, which mentions &quot;the supreme being of the threefold world&quot; (&quot;triplicis mundi summum&quot;). In one manuscript, the author says of Statius, &quot;Dicit deum Demogorgona summum, cuius scire nomen non licet&quot; (&quot;He is speaking of the Demogorgon, the supreme god, whose name it is not permitted to know&quot;, or perhaps &quot;He is speaking of a god, the supreme Demogorgon&quot;). Prior to Lactantius, there is no mention of the supposed &quot;Demogorgon&quot; anywhere by any writer, pagan or Christian. However, as noted above, there are several different manuscript traditions, including one that gives &quot;demoirgon&quot;, which has been taken by most critical editors to indicate some form of misconstruction of the Greek &quot;dēmiourgon&quot;. Jahnke thus restores the text to read &quot;He is speaking of the Demiurge, whose name it is not permitted to know&quot;. However, this phantom word in one of the manuscript traditions took on a life of its own among later scholars.

In the Early Middle Ages, Demogorgon is mentioned in the tenth-century &quot;Adnotationes super Lucanum&quot;, a series of short notes to Lucan&#x27;s &quot;Pharsalia&quot; that are included in the &quot;Commenta Bernensia&quot;, the &quot;Berne Scholia on Lucan&quot;.

By the Late Middle Ages, the reality of a primordial &quot;Demogorgon&quot; was so well fixed in the European imagination that &quot;Demogorgon&#x27;s son Pan&quot; became a bizarre variant reading for &quot;Hermes&#x27; son Pan&quot; in one manuscript tradition of Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Genealogia Deorum gentilium&quot; (&quot;Genealogies of the Gods&quot;:1.3–4 and 2.1), misreading a line in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Demogorgon&quot; is mentioned as a &quot;primal&quot; god in quite a few Renaissance texts, and impressively glossed &quot;Demon-Gorgon,&quot; i.e., &quot;Terror-Demon&quot; or &quot;God of the Earth&quot;. The French historian and mythographer Jean Seznec, for instance, now determines in &quot;Demogorgon&quot; an allusion to the Demiurge (&quot;Craftsman&quot; or &quot;Maker&quot;) of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus.&quot; For a remarkable early text identifying Ovid&#x27;s Demiurge (1/1, here) as &quot;sovereign Demogorgon&quot;, see the paraphrase of &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; I in Abraham France, &quot;The third part of the Countesse of Pembrokes Yuychurch&quot; (London, 1592), sig. A2v.&quot;

==In literature==
Demogorgon was taken up by Christian writers as a demon of Hell:

Note, however, Milton does not refer to the inhabitants of Hell, but of an unformed region where Chaos rules with Night. In Milton&#x27;s epic poem Satan passes through this region while traveling from Hell to Earth.

Demogorgon&#x27;s name was earlier invoked by Faustus in Scene III of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (1590) when the eponymous Doctor summons Mephistopheles with a Latin incantation.

The sixteenth-century Dutch demonologist Johann Weyer described Demogorgon as the master of fate in hell&#x27;s hierarchy.

According to Ariosto&#x27;s lesser work &quot;I Cinque Canti&quot;, Demogorgon has a splendid temple palace in the Imavo mountains (today&#x27;s Himalaya) where every five years the Fates and genii are all summoned to appear before him and give an account of their actions. They travel through the air in various strange conveyances, and it is no easy matter to distinguish between their convention and a Witches&#x27; Sabbath. When elements of Ariosto&#x27;s poem supplied Philippe Quinault&#x27;s libretto for Jean-Baptiste Lully&#x27;s opera &quot;Roland&quot;, performed at Versailles, 8 January 1685, Demogorgon was king of the fairies and master of ceremonies.

Demogorgon also is mentioned in the Book II of the epic poem &quot;El Bernardo&quot; written in Mexico by Bernardo de Balbuena and published in Spain in 1624. The passage tells how the fairy, &quot;Alcina&quot;, visits Demogorgon in his infernal palace:
Aquí Demogorgon está sentado&lt;br&gt;en su banco fatal, cuyo decreto&lt;br&gt;de las supremas causas es guardado&lt;br&gt;por inviolable y celestial preceto.&lt;br&gt;Las parcas y su estambre delicado&lt;br&gt;a cuyo huso el mundo está sujeto,&lt;br&gt;la fea muerte y el vivir lucido&lt;br&gt;y el negro lago del oscuro olvido
&lt;br&gt; — (Libro II, estrofa 19)

Demogorgon is mentioned in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;:

A bold bad man, that dar&#x27;d to call by name&lt;br&gt;Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,&lt;br&gt;At which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight.
&lt;br&gt; — (Canto I, stanza 37)

and:

Downe in the bottome of the deepe &quot;Abysse&quot;&lt;br&gt;Where &quot;Demogorgon&quot; in dull darknesse pent,&lt;br&gt;Farre from the view of Gods and heauens blis,&lt;br&gt;The hideous &quot;Chaos&quot; keepes, their dreadfull dwelling is. 
&lt;br&gt; — (Book IV, Canto ii, stanza 47)

Demogorgon is the central character in Voltaire&#x27;s 1756 short story &quot;Plato&#x27;s Dream&quot; - a &quot;lesser superbeing&quot; who was responsible for creating the planet Earth.

He is also the protagonist of an opera &quot;Il Demogorgone, ovvero il filosofo confuso&quot; (&quot;Demogorgon, or the Confused Philosopher&quot; by Vincenzo Righini (1786) with a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte, which originally was written for Mozart.

One of the lead characters pretends to be Demogorgon in Johann Karl August Musäus&#x27; literary fairy tale &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Roland&#x27;s Squires&#x27;) from (volume 1, 1782).

In Herman Melville&#x27;s 1851 novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, the first mate of the ship, &quot;Pequod&quot;, Starbuck, describes the white whale as the &quot;demigorgon &quot; of the ship&#x27;s &quot;heathen crew&quot; (see ch. XXXVIII, paragraph 2).

Demogorgon also appears as a character in Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;. In this lyrical drama, Demogorgon is the offspring of Jupiter and Thetis who eventually dethrones Jupiter. It is never mentioned whether Demogorgon, portrayed as a dark, shapeless spirit, is female or male. The theory of Demogorgon&#x27;s name originating from Greek &quot;demos&quot; and &quot;gorgos&quot; may be the foundation for its use in this text as an allusion to a politically active and revolutionary populace. Shelley&#x27;s allusions to the French Revolution further support this.

In the poem &quot;Demogorgon&quot; by Álvaro de Campos, the writer is afraid of becoming mad by learning the true nature and unveiling the mystery of life.

==In popular culture==
===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;===
In the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role-playing game, Demogorgon is a powerful demon prince. He is known as the Prince of Demons, a self-proclaimed title, but one that is acknowledged by mortals and even his fellow demons because of his power and influence. Demogorgon was also named an &quot;iconic D&amp;D character&quot; by Witwer &quot;et al.&quot; and one of the greatest villains in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; history by the final print issue of &quot;Dragon&quot;. He is depicted as an eighteen foot tall, reptilian (or amphibious) hermaphroditic tanar&#x27;ri (a type of demon) with a somewhat humanoid form (His torso is depicted as ape-like in accompanying art). Two mandrill or hyena heads sprout from his twin snake-like necks, and his arms end in long tentacles. His two heads have individual minds and names.

Demogorgon first appeared in the original edition of &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot;, in &quot;Eldritch Wizardry&quot; (1976), and has appeared in every subsequent edition of the game. Already in 1976 miniatures of Demogorgon were produced by MiniFigs based on &quot;Gygax&#x27;s specifications and Dave Sutherland&#x27;s illustration from &quot;Eldritch Wizardry&quot;.&quot;

===&quot;Stranger Things&quot;===
Demogorgon is the name given to the otherworldly creature which appeared in the Netflix original show &quot;Stranger Things&quot;, which began airing in 2016. This name is inspired by the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; creature.
