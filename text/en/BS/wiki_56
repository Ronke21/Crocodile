<text>The Leleges (; ) were an aboriginal people of the Aegean region, before the Greeks arrived. They were distinct from another pre-Hellenic people of the region, the Pelasgians. The exact areas to which they were native are uncertain, since they were apparently pre-literate and the only references to them are in ancient Greek sources. These references are casual and (it is alleged) sometimes fictitious. Likewise, little is known about the language of the &quot;Leleges&quot;.

Many Greek authors link the Leleges to the Carians of south-west Anatolia. Homer names the Leleges among the Trojan allies alongside the Carians, Pelasgians, Paeonians and Gaucones.

==Etymology==
It is thought that the name &quot;Leleges&quot; is an exonym, in a long-extinct language, rather than an endonym (or autonym). That is, during the Bronze Age the word &quot;lulahi&quot; apparently meaning &quot;strangers&quot; was used in the Luwian language and in other Anatolian languages. For example, in a Hittite cuneiform inscription, priests and temple servants are directed to avoid conversing with &quot;lulahi&quot; and foreign merchants. According to the suggestion of Vitaly Shevoroshkin, an attempt to transliterate &quot;lulahi&quot; into Greek might result in &quot;leleges&quot;.

Late traditions reported in Pseudo-Apollodorus, &quot;Bibliotheke&quot;, and by Pausanias, derive the name from an eponymous king &quot;Lelex&quot;; a comparable etymology, memorializing a legendary founder, is provided by Greek mythographers for virtually every tribe of Hellenes: &quot;Lelex and the Leleges, whatever their historical significance, have acted as a blank sheet on which to draw Lakonia and all it means,&quot; observes Ken Dowden.

== Ancient sources on Leleges ==

===Anatolia===
In Homer&#x27;s Iliad, the &quot;Leleges&quot; are allies of the Trojans (10.429), though they do not appear in the formal catalogue of allies in Book II of the Iliad, and their homeland is not specified. They are distinguished from the Carians, with whom some later writers confused them; they have a king, Altes, and a city Pedasus which was sacked by Achilles. The topographical name &quot;Pedasus&quot; occurs in several ancient places: near Cyzicus, in the Troad on the Satniois River, in Caria, as well as in Messenia, according to &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 1911. Gargara in the Troad was counted as Lelegian. Alcaeus (7th or 6th century BCE) calls Antandrus in the Troad &quot;Lelegian&quot;, but later Herodotus substitutes the epithet &quot;Pelasgian&quot;, so perhaps the two designations were broadly synonymous for the Greeks.

According to Homer, the Leleges were a distinct Anatolian tribe. However, Herodotus states that &quot;Leleges&quot; had been an early name for the Carians.

Pherecydes of Athens (&quot;ca&quot; 480 BC) attributed to the &quot;Leleges&quot; the coast land of Caria, from Ephesus to Phocaea, with the islands of Samos and Chios, placing the true Carians farther south from Ephesus to Miletus.

Pausanias was reminded that the temple of the goddess at Ephesus predated the Ionian colony there, when it was rededicated to the goddess as Artemis. He states with certainty that it antedated the Ionic immigration by many years, being older even than the oracular shrine at Dodona. He says that the pre-Ionic inhabitants of the city were Leleges and Lydians (with a predominance of the latter) and that, although Androclus drove out of the land all those whom he found in the upper city, he did not interfere with those who dwelt about the sanctuary. By giving and receiving pledges he put these on a footing of neutrality. These remarks of Pausanias find confirmation in the form of the cult in historic times, centering on a many-breasted icon of the &quot;Lady of Ephesus&quot; whom Greeks called Artemis. Other cult aspects, being in all essentials non-Hellenic, suggest the indigenous cult was taken over by the Greek settlers.

Often historians assume, as a general rule, that autochthonous inhabitants survive an invasion as an under-class where they do not retreat to mountain districts, so it is interesting to hear in &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; that Philippus of Theangela (a 4th-century BC historian) referred to &quot;Leleges&quot; still surviving as serfs of the &quot;true Carians&quot;, and even later Strabo attributes to the &quot;Leleges&quot; a distinctive group of deserted forts and tombs in Caria that were still known in his day as &quot;Lelegean forts&quot;; the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 1911 identified these as ruins that could still be traced ranging from the neighborhood of Theangela and Halicarnassus as far north as Miletus, the southern limit of the &quot;true Carians&quot; of Pherecydes. Plutarch also implies the historic existence of Lelegian serfs at Tralles (now Aydın) in the interior.

===Greece and the Aegean===
The fourth-century BC historian Philippus of Theangela suggested that the Leleges maintained connections to Messenia, Laconia, Locris and other regions in mainland Greece, after they were overcome by the Carians in Asia Minor.

A single passage in the fragmentary Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot; places &quot;Leleges&quot; in Deucalion&#x27;s mythicized and archaic time in Locris in central Greece, identified as the rocks turned human that repopulated the earth after the great deluge. Locris is also the refuge of some of the Pelasgian inhabitants forced from Boeotia by Cadmus and his Phoenician adventurers. But not until the 4th century BCE does any other writer place &quot;Leleges&quot; anywhere west of the Aegean. But the confusion of the &quot;Leleges&quot; with the Carians (immigrant conquerors akin to Lydians and Mysians) which first appears in a Cretan legend (quoted by Herodotus, but repudiated, as he says, by the Carians themselves) and is repeated by Callisthenes, Apollodorus, and other later writers, led easily to the suggestion of Callisthenes, that &quot;Leleges&quot; joined the Carians in their (half legendary) raids on the coasts of Greece.

Herodotus (1.171) says that the &quot;Leleges&quot; were a people who in old times dwelt in the islands of the Aegean and were subject to Minos of Crete (one of the historic references that led Sir Arthur Evans to name the pre-Hellenic Cretan culture &quot;Minoan&quot;); and that they were driven from their homes by the Dorians and Ionians, after which they took refuge in Caria and were named Carians. Herodotus was a Dorian Greek born in Caria himself.

Meanwhile, other writers from the 4th century onwards claimed to discover them in Boeotia, west Acarnania (Leucas), and later again in Thessaly, Euboea, Megara, Lacedaemon and Messenia. In Messenia, they were reputed to have been immigrant founders of Pylos, and were connected with the seafaring Taphians and Teleboans, and distinguished from the Pelasgians. However, in Lacedaemon and in Leucas they were believed to be aboriginal and Dionysius of Halicarnassus mentions that &quot;Leleges&quot; is the old name for the later Locrians. These European &quot;Leleges&quot; must be interpreted in connection with the recurrence of place names like Pedasus, Physcus, Larymna and Abae, both in Caria, and in these &quot;Lelegian&quot; parts of Greece. Perhaps this is the result of some early migration; perhaps it is also the cause of these Lelegian theories; perhaps there was a widespread pre-Indo-European culture that loosely linked these regions, a possibility on which much modern hypothesis has been constructed.
Germanic theorists of the 19th century who inspired modern heirs: 
*H. Kiepert. &quot;Über den Volksstamm der Leleges&quot;, (in &quot;Monatsberichte Berliner Akademie,&quot; 1861, p. 114) asserted that the Leleges were an aboriginal people and linked them to Illyrians.
*K. W. Deimling. &quot;Die Leleger&quot; (Leipzig, 1862), places their origins in southwest Asia Minor, and brings them thence to Greece, essentially repeating the classical Greek view.
*G. F. Unger. &quot;Hellas in Thessalien,&quot; in &quot;Philologus&quot;, supplement. ii. (1863), made them Phoenician.
*E. Curtius. &quot;History of Greece&quot;, (vol. i) even distinguished a &quot;Lelegian&quot; phase of nascent Aegean culture.

<text>Dracaena () is a genus of about 200 species of trees and succulent shrubs. The formerly accepted genera &quot;Pleomele&quot; and &quot;Sansevieria&quot; are now included in &quot;Dracaena&quot;. In the APG IV classification system, it is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae). It has also formerly been separated (sometimes with &quot;Cordyline&quot;) into the family Dracaenaceae or kept in the Agavaceae (now Agavoideae).

The name &quot;dracaena&quot; is derived from the romanized form of the Ancient Greek – &quot;drakaina&quot;, &quot;female dragon&quot;.

The majority of the species are native to Africa and the Canary Islands, southern Asia through to northern Australia, with two species in tropical Central America.

==Description==
Species of &quot;Dracaena&quot; have a secondary thickening meristem in their trunk, termed Dracaenoid thickening by some authors, which is quite different from the thickening meristem found in dicotyledonous plants. This characteristic is shared with members of the Agavoideae and Xanthorrhoeoideae among other members of the Asparagales.

&quot;Dracaena&quot; species can be identified in two growth types: treelike dracaenas (&quot;Dracaena fragrans&quot;, &quot;Dracaena draco&quot;, &quot;Dracaena cinnabari&quot;), which have aboveground stems that branch from nodes after flowering, or if the growth tip is severed, and rhizomatous dracaenas (&quot;Dracaena trifasciata&quot;, &quot;Dracaena angolensis&quot;), which have underground rhizomes and leaves on the surface (ranging from straplike to cylindrical).

Many species of &quot;Dracaena&quot; are kept as houseplants due to tolerance of lower light and sparse watering.

==Uses==
===Ornamental===
Some shrubby species, such as &quot;D. fragrans&quot;, &quot;D. surculosa&quot;, &quot;D. marginata&quot;, and &quot;D. sanderiana&quot;, are popular as houseplants. Many of these are toxic to pets, though not humans, according to the ASPCA among others. Rooted stem cuttings of &quot;D. sanderiana&quot; are sold as &quot;lucky bamboo&quot;, although only superficially resembling true bamboos.

Dracaena houseplants like humidity and moderate watering. They can tolerate periods of drought but the tips of the leaves may turn brown. Leaves at the base will naturally yellow and drop off, leaving growth at the top and a bare stem. Dracaena are vulnerable to mealybugs and scale insects.

===Other===
A naturally occurring bright red resin, dragon&#x27;s blood, is collected from &quot;D. draco&quot; and, in ancient times, from &quot;D. cinnabari&quot;. Modern dragon&#x27;s blood is however more likely to be from the unrelated &quot;Calamus&quot; rattan palms, formerly placed in &quot;Daemonorops&quot;. It also has social functions in marking graves, sacred sites, and farm plots in many African societies.

<text>Potentilla erecta (syn. Tormentilla erecta, Potentilla laeta, Potentilla tormentilla, known as the (common) tormentil, septfoil or erect cinquefoil ) is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the rose family (Rosaceae).

==Description==
&quot;Potentilla erecta&quot; is a low, clump-forming plant with slender, procumbent to arcuately upright stalks, growing tall and with non-rooting runners. It grows wild predominantly in Europe and western Asia, mostly on acid soils and in a wide variety of habitats such as mountains, heaths, meadows, sandy soils and dunes.

This plant flowers from May to August/September. There is one yellow, wide flower, growing at the tip of a long stalk. There are almost always four notched petals, each between 3 and 6 mm long. Four petals are rather uncommon in the rose family. The petals are somewhat longer than the sepals. There are 20–25 stamens.

The radical leaves have a long petiole, whilst the leaves on the flowering stalks are usually sessile or with short petioles. The glossy leaves are alternate, ternate, consisting of three obovate leaflets with serrated margins. The paired stipules are leaflike and palmately lobed.

There are 2–8 dry, inedible fruits.
==Distribution==
===Europe===
&quot;Potentilla erecta&quot; is found wild throughout Europe, Scandinavia and West Asia.

&quot;Potentilla erecta&quot; is almost ubiquitous in the British Isles, recorded in almost all 10 km squares except close to the Wash. and is listed as a species of least concern. It is very common in grasslands, heaths, moors and mountains, bogs including roadsides and pastures, mostly on acidic soils but avoiding chalk. It is a component of British National Vegetation Classification community M25 (&quot;Molinia caerulea&quot;–&quot;Potentilla erecta&quot; mire).

===North America===
In North America &quot;Potentilla erecta&quot; is found in the east as an introduced species.

==Uses==
The rhizomatous root is thick. It has little value for food use because of its bitterness and low caloric value. The roots are a main ingredient of a bitter liqueur from Bavaria and the Black Forest area, called Blutwurz. It is also used in Ukraine along with honey in horilka.
The plant is used in herbal medicine as an astringent because of its tannin content, which is unusually high for a herbaceous plant. Structurally-related phlobaphenes, used as a red dye for leather known as &quot;tormentil red&quot;, can be extracted from the root of the common tormentil along with the triterpene alcohol tormentiol. Aqueous extracts of the rhizomes are reported to have low toxicity in rats and mice.

<doc id="549472" wikidata="Q7440127" url="?curid=549472" title="Sea slug">
<text>Sea slug is a common name for some marine invertebrates with varying levels of resemblance to terrestrial slugs. Most creatures known as sea slugs are gastropods, i.e. they are sea snails (marine gastropod mollusks) that, over evolutionary time, have either entirely lost their shells or have seemingly lost their shells due to having a significantly reduced or internal shell. The name &quot;sea slug&quot; is often applied to nudibranchs and a paraphyletic set of other marine gastropods without apparent shells.

Sea slugs have an enormous variation in body shape, color, and size. Most are partially translucent. The often bright colors of reef-dwelling species imply that these animals are under constant threat of predators. Still, the color can warn other animals of the sea slug&#x27;s toxic stinging cells (nematocysts) or offensive taste. Like all gastropods, they have small, razor-sharp teeth called radulas. Most sea slugs have a pair of rhinophores—sensory tentacles used primarily for the sense of smell—on their head, with a small eye at the base of each rhinophore. Many have feathery structures (cerata) on the back, often in a contrasting color, which act as gills. All species of genuine sea slugs have a selected prey animal on which they depend for food, including certain jellyfish, bryozoans, sea anemones, plankton, and other species of sea slugs.

Sea slugs have brains. For example, &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; has a brain of about 20,000 nerve cells.

==Shell-less marine gastropods==
The name &quot;sea slug&quot; is often applied to numerous different evolutionary lineages of marine gastropod molluscs or sea snails, specifically those gastropods that are either not conchiferous (shell-bearing) or appear not to be. In evolutionary terms, losing the shell altogether, having a small internal shell, or having a shell so small that the soft parts of the animal cannot retract into it, are all features that have evolved many times independently within the class Gastropoda, on land and in the sea; these features often cause a gastropod to be labeled with the common name &quot;slug&quot;.

Nudibranchs (clade Nudibranchia) are a large group of marine gastropods that have no shell at all. These may be the most familiar sort of sea slug. Although most nudibranchs are not large, they are often very eye-catching because so many species have brilliant coloration. In addition to nudibranchs, a number of other taxa of marine gastropods (some easily mistaken for nudibranchs) are also often called &quot;sea slugs&quot;.

===Gastropod groups===

Within the various groups of gastropods that are called &quot;sea slugs&quot;, numerous families are within the informal taxonomic group Opisthobranchia. The term &quot;sea slug&quot; is perhaps most often applied to nudibranchs, many of which are brightly patterned and conspicuously ornate. The name &quot;sea slug&quot; is also often applied to the sacoglossans (clade Sacoglossa), the so-called sap-sucking or solar-powered sea slugs which are frequently a shade of green.

Another group of main gastropods that are often labeled as &quot;sea slugs&quot; are the various families of headshield slugs and bubble snails within the clade Cephalaspidea. The sea hares, clade Aplysiomorpha, have a small, flat, proteinaceous internal shell. The clades Thecosomata and Gymnosomata are small pelagic gastropods known as &quot;sea butterflies&quot; and &quot;sea angels&quot;. Many species of sea butterflies retain their shells. These are commonly known as &quot;pteropods&quot; but are also sometimes called sea slugs; especially the Gymnosomata, which have no shell as adults.
There is also one group of &quot;sea slugs&quot; within the informal group Pulmonata. One very unusual group of marine gastropods that are shell-less are the pulmonate (air-breathing) species in the family Onchidiidae, within the clade Systellommatophora.

==Diversity in sea slugs==
Like many nudibranchs, &quot;Glaucus atlanticus&quot; can store and use stinging cells, or nematocysts, from its prey (Portuguese man o&#x27; war) in its finger-like cerata.
Other species, like the Pyjama slug &quot;Chromodoris quadricolor&quot;, may use their striking colors to advertise their foul chemical taste.

The lettuce sea slug (&quot;Elysia crispata&quot;) has lettuce-like ruffles that line its body. This slug, like other Sacoglossa, uses kleptoplasty, a process in which the slug absorbs chloroplasts from the algae it eats, and uses &quot;stolen&quot; cells to photosynthesize sugars. The ruffles of the lettuce sea slug increase the slug&#x27;s surface area, allowing the cells to absorb more light.

Headshield slugs, like the &quot;Chelidonura varians&quot;, use their shovel-shaped heads to dig into the sand, where they spend most of their time. The shield also protects sand from entering the mantle during burrowing.

&quot;Peronia indica&quot; is a species of air-breathing sea slug, a shell-less marine pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Onchidiidae.

The largest species of sea hare, the California black sea hare, &quot;Aplysia vaccaria&quot; can reach a length of 75 centimetres (30 in) and a weight of 14 kilograms (31 lb). Most sea hares have several defenses; in addition to being naturally toxic, they can eject a foul ink or secrete a viscous slime to deter predators.

Some species of acochlidian sea slugs have made evolutionary transitions to living in freshwater streams and there is at least one evolutionary transition to land.

<text>The seventh Royal Navy ship to be named HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was the United Kingdom&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, built by Vickers Armstrongs at Barrow-in-Furness. Launched by Queen Elizabeth II on Trafalgar Day 1960 and commissioned into service with the Royal Navy in April 1963, she continued in service until 1980. The submarine was powered by a S5W reactor, a design made available as a direct result of the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.

==Design and construction==
The Royal Navy had been researching designs for nuclear propulsion plants since 1946, but this work was suspended indefinitely in October 1952. In 1955, the United States Navy completed , the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine. During subsequent exercises with the Royal Navy, &quot;Nautilus&quot; demonstrated the advantages of the nuclear submarine against British anti-submarine forces, which had developed extensive anti-submarine warfare techniques during the Battle of the Atlantic. The Admiralty appreciated the utility of such vessels and under the drive of the First Sea Lord, Admiral The Earl Mountbatten of Burma and the Flag Officer Submarines, Sir Wilfred Woods, plans were formed to build nuclear-powered submarines.

Although the plan was to build all-British nuclear submarines, much time would be saved by accepting American nuclear technology. The excellent relations between Admiral Mountbatten and US Navy Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh Burke, expedited obtaining that help. This was despite Rear Admiral Hyman Rickover, in charge of the American naval nuclear power programme, being set against any transfer of technology; indeed, Rickover prevented Mountbatten inspecting USS &quot;Nautilus&quot;. It was not until a visit to Britain in 1956 that Rickover changed his mind and withdrew his objections. Although Rickover wished to supply the third generation S3W reactor of the , Mountbatten exerted his influence and the entire machinery system for an American , with its fifth generation S5W reactor, was obtained. This was known as the &quot;American Sector&quot; (see 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement). The hull and combat systems of &quot;Dreadnought&quot; were of British design and construction, although British access to the Electric Boat Company influenced the hull form and construction practices. During &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s construction, Rolls-Royce, in collaboration with the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority at the Admiralty Research Station, HMS &quot;Vulcan&quot;, at Dounreay, developed a completely new British nuclear propulsion system. On 31 August 1960, the UK&#x27;s second nuclear-powered submarine was ordered from Vickers Armstrong and, fitted with Rolls-Royce&#x27;s PWR1 nuclear plant, was the first all-British nuclear submarine.

The name &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was chosen because it represented &#x27;a land-mark in naval history, associated as it is with revolutionary war-ship design.&#x27; &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was laid down on 12 June 1959. She was at that time the largest pressure vessel ever constructed in the UK. The hull was constructed of QT35 steel (QT standing for Quenched and Tempered) designed to withstand greater depths.

She was launched by Queen Elizabeth II on Trafalgar Day, 21 October 1960. She then proceeded for fitting out at a nearby floating dock. The reactor was installed on 8 July 1962 and went critical in November 1962. She commenced sea-trials in mid-December 1962 in the Irish Sea. &quot;Dreadnought&quot; made her first dive, in Ramsden Dock, on 10 January 1963. She was commissioned on 17 April 1963.

==Construction programme==
==Service==
In the mid-1960s, &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s visits included trips to Norfolk, Virginia; Bermuda; Rotterdam; and Kiel. In October 1964, she participated in a joint maritime exercise with US and Canadian naval forces to the north of Scotland. During the exercise, the task force was monitored by a group of three Soviet submarines and three Soviet ships.

She was at Gibraltar in 1965, 1966, and 1967, and on 19 September 1967, she left Rosyth, Scotland for Singapore on a sustained high-speed run. The round trip finished as 4,640 miles surfaced and 26,545 miles submerged.

During her career, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; performed many varied missions. On 24 June 1967, she was ordered to sink the wrecked and drifting German ship &quot;Essberger Chemist&quot;. Three torpedoes hit along the length of the target, but the gunners of , a frigate, completed the task by piercing the tanks which were just keeping &quot;Essberger Chemist&quot; afloat.

Apart from minor hull-cracking problems, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; proved to be a reliable vessel, popular with her crews. On 10 September 1970, she completed a major refit at Rosyth, in the course of which her nuclear core was refuelled and her ballast tank valves were changed to reduce noise.

In early 1971, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; took part in an Arctic exercise, codenamed &#x27;Sniff&#x27;. While participating in the exercise under the command of CO Alan Kennedy, on 3 March 1971, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; became the first British nuclear submarine to surface at the North Pole. On return to Faslane, it was later discovered that the ice had caused minor damage to the propeller, bow and fins.

In 1973, she took part in the Royal Navy&#x27;s first annual Group Deployment, when a group of warships and auxiliaries would undertake a long deployment to maintain fighting efficiency and &quot;show the flag&quot; around the world.

In November 1977, while under the command of CO Hugh Mitchell, she diverted from a planned 8-month deployment to Australia to proceed to Gibraltar and then to the South Atlantic. Together with the frigates and , &quot;Dreadnought&quot; took part in Operation Journeyman, a deployment to the South Atlantic in 1977 (prior to the Falklands War) to deter possible Argentine aggression against the Falkland Islands and to undertake covert surveillance.

==Fate==
Due to machinery damage and the limited refit facilities then available for nuclear fleet submarines, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was withdrawn from service in 1980.
&quot;Dreadnought&quot; is now at Rosyth Dockyard, laid up in afloat storage until she can be safely disposed under the auspices of the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD)&#x27;s Submarine Dismantling Project (SDP). Her nuclear fuel has been removed but much of her interior remains intact. She was docked down during 2012 for her periodic hull inspection and re-preservation. Campaigners hope that she will be returned to Barrow after decommissioning as a tourist attraction in the town.

<doc id="549475" wikidata="Q29170" url="?curid=549475" title="Korean Jindo">
<text>The Jindo dog () is an indigenous dog native to the island of Jindo in South Korea. It is also known as () and formerly known as the Chindo dog.

It is one of South Korea&#x27;s National Treasures. It has a reputation for being loyal and good at tracking things. Due to its protected status within South Korea, only dogs born on Jindo Island can be officially registered as a Jindo by the Government of South Korea after an inspection. The dog was registered as a breed by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1998 and by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 2005.

The pronunciation(Jindo-gae) also means an official term for warning measures issued in the event of a localized threat situation.

==Description==

===Appearance===
Jindos are double-coated spitz-type dogs. The keen and alert appearance of the Jindo gives the impression of intelligence, strength, loyalty, and agility. Other features include forward-pointing upright ears.

====Body====
Korean Jindo owners have traditionally divided Jindos into two body types:

* Tonggol or Gyeopgae: This type is more muscular and stocky with the Korean National Dog Association (KNDA) recognizing an equal proportion of height at the withers to length (10:10). The depth of chest is approximately equal to one-half the height at the withers. The loin is also typically shorter.
* Hudu or Hotgae: This type is more slender with a somewhat less depth of chest and a slightly longer loin. Moreover, other physical features tend to have an increased length, such as the ears, muzzle, and head. This results in an appearance that is longer than tall with the KNDA recommending a height at the withers to length ratio of 10:11.

The KNDA also recognizes a third body type called Gakgol which is a gradually emerging combination of the two traditional types, retaining the length of body of the Hudu and the depth of chest of the Tonggol.

In regards to the Jindo&#x27;s body appearance, the United Kennel Club currently states, &quot;The squarely built Jindo has a chest that is moderately deep but not too broad. At its deepest point the chest reaches to, or just above, the elbow. The brisket is well developed and the ribs are well sprung. The back is strong and straight and the loin is well muscled, taut, lean and narrower than the ribcage. There is considerable tuck up.&quot;

====Color====
Jindos come in six colors:
* White (Baekgu/백구) - This color is actually an off-white or ivory shade with tan or light brown around the tips of the ears, the back of the hind legs, and the tip of the tail. Some whites may have a subtle tan stripe running from the head, down the top line, to the tail.
* Fawn (Hwanggu/황구) - The color of well-ripened wheat.
* Wolf Grey (Jaegu/재구) - This coat looks gray from a distance but is actually made up of individual white, black, and fawn colored hairs.
* Black and tan (Naenunbagi/네눈박이 or Black-tan/블랙탄) - Black with tan on the muzzle, legs, and paws, and an eye-shaped tan spot over each eye.
* Brindle (hogu/호구) - Also known as &quot;Tiger&quot; pattern. Thin, dark brown or black stripes like a tiger&#x27;s on a fawn base. These stripes appear at an early age.
* Black (heukgu/흑구) - Solid black, very rare.

Some Jindo Island residents value black, black/red, and red/white Jindos as good hunters. The United Kennel Club recognizes six different coat colors: white, red fawn, wolf grey, black, black and tan, and brindle (tiger pattern).


===Feet===
The feet are of medium size, round in shape, with thick, strong tan pads. Nails are hard and may be black, cream or gray.

===Gait===
* The Jindo moves with strides of moderate length.
* It is a quick, light, elastic trot which enables the Jindo to travel quickly over any terrain.
* The forelegs and hind legs are carried straight forward, with neither elbows nor stifles turned in or out.
* At a normal walking speed, the Jindo tends to lower its head.

===Head===
* The top skull of an adult dog should be broad and rounded between the ears and free from wrinkles.
* The under jaw is well-developed and helps give a round or octagonal shape to the head when viewed from the front. Coarse hairs stand away from the cheeks.
* The ears are triangular and upright (leaning forward past vertical), yet are unique among other spitz breeds for ears that splay out to the sides, creating a shape similar to airplane wings. The inside of the ears should be well-furred and thick cartilage is desired. Ears on puppies normally lie flat until they are past 5–6 months.
* The eyes are almond shaped. They should be a shade of dark brown. Some dogs have light brown eyes but this color is not desirable according to the Korean Jindo Dog Association. Jindos do not have blue eyes.
* The nose should be black on non-white dogs. White dogs may have flesh noses.
* The muzzle is well proportioned without being bulky. The lips should be taut and black. The preferred color for the tongue is solid pink.
* The Jindo has a complete set of evenly spaced, white teeth with a scissors bite.
* Typically, males have larger heads and females have more fox-like features.

===Height and weight===
Desirable height at maturity, measured at the withers, ranges from 19½ to 21 inches (or 48 to 53 cm) for males and 18½ to 20 inches (or 45 to 50 cm) for females.

Weight should be in proportion to the height, giving a well-muscled, lean appearance without being too light or too heavy. The typical weight range for a male Jindo in good condition is 40 to 60 pounds (18 to 27 kg); for a female, 35 to 55 pounds (16 to 25 kg).

===Tail===
The tail is thick and strong and set on at the end of the top line. The tail should be at least long enough to reach to the hock joint. The tail may be loosely curled over the back or carried over the back in a sickle position. The hair on the underside of the tail is thick, stiff, abundant, and twice as long as the coat on the shoulders, which causes the hair to fan outward when the tail is up.

==Character==
Jindo dogs are well known for their loyalty and gentle nature. Since Jindo dogs are active, they need proper living space, walks, care, and attention. There is also a clear perception of family hierarchy.

They are of medium to high energy. If kept in a yard, the fencing must be at least 6 feet high due to their strong hind legs that enable them to jump high. Because Jindos are active and intelligent, they require frequent interaction with people or other dogs.
===Loyalty===
In 1993, a 7-year-old female Jindo named Baekgu (백구; 白狗; translated as a White Dog), raised by Park Bok-dan (박복단), an 83-year-old woman on Jindo Island, was sold to a new owner in the city of Daejeon which is located about 300 km (180 mi) away from the island. The dog escaped her new home and returned to her original owner, Park, after seven months, haggard and exhausted. Baekgu remained with her original owner, who decided to keep the loyal dog, until the dog died of natural causes seven years later. The story was a national sensation in South Korea and was made into cartoons, a TV documentary, and a children&#x27;s storybook. In 2004, Jindo County erected a statue of Baekgu in her hometown to honor the dog.

Another Jindo, also named Baekgu, a four-year-old male at the time who lived alone with his owner Park Wan-suh (박완서) residing on Jindo Island, did not eat anything and mourned for his dead owner for seven days after the owner died from a liver disease in June 2000. According to &quot;Chosun Ilbo&quot;, the dog accompanied his dead owner for three days until other people came to find the body, followed the owner to his funeral, and came back home, not eating anything for four days. The Korean Jindo Dog Research Institute (진돗개 시험연구소) brought him under its care, but a person related to the Institute announced that the dog would not interact with anyone except for his feeder as of 2005.

==History==
The Jindo dog was researched by Tamezo Mori, a professor of Keijō Imperial University in February 1937 and it was registered as 53rd of Natural Treasure of the Government-General of Chōsen in May 1938.

The Jindo dog managed to survive Korea under Japanese rule between 1910 and 1945 due to Japanese biologists recognizing its similarity to Japan&#x27;s native dogs, whereas other Korean dog breeds were killed by the Japanese. In 1962, the Government of South Korea designated the Jindo as the 53rd &#x27;Natural Treasure&#x27; (or translated as &#x27;Natural Monument&#x27;) (천연기념물; 天然記念物) and was thusly protected along with all designated Natural Treasures under the Cultural Heritage Protection Act the same year. Because of the special status of the Jindo, it is very difficult to export pure Jindo Island Jindo dogs outside of Korea. Jindos marched in the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea.

The Jindo Dogs Guild of Korea (), as of 2008, issues certificates of Korean Jindo dog purity, which specifies the registered number of the mother, sex, and birth date of the dog, as well as breeder&#x27;s address, and certifies that the dog is purely of Jindo Island origin.

The Jindo first appeared in the West in France, and a small number have since been introduced to the United Kingdom and the United States, both in an official capacity and by Korean immigrants. The Jindo dog as a breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club on January 1, 1998. As of 2016, there were only two registered Jindos in the U.S.: one in the Los Angeles area and one in Seattle. There were 25 registered in the United Kingdom.

===Lineage=== 
A 2020 study showed that Jindos and other East and Southeast Asian dogs share some common ancestry with the New Guinea singing dog. These dogs were shown in this same study to be more phylogenetically related to each other than to other more selectively bred dog breeds, most of which contain far greater percentages of the Modern European lineage. DNA analysis indicates another common ancestor around 900 years ago that the Donggyeongi dog and the Korean Jindo separated from.

In a genomic analysis of the Jindo dog, several mitochondrial DNA genotypes unique to the Jindo were noted. Within the same study, the Jindo&#x27;s unique mitochondrial DNA genome was reflected in its similarities to other dogs but distinctive branch on the mapped canine phylogenetic tree.

=== Kennel club recognition ===
Internationally, the Jindo is fully recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and the United Kennel Club. It is under the Foundation Stock Service in the American Kennel Club, which is the first step in achieving recognition, and in the Import category of the Kennel Club. In their country of origin, they are recognized by the Korean Kennel Federation, Korean Kennel Club, and Jindo specialty shows are held seasonally by local Jindo clubs.
==Human utilization of Jindos==
Naturally having a strong prey drive, Jindo dogs were traditionally utilized by the various inhabitants of Jindo (island) for hunting game animals, including water deer and wild boar. In more modern times, the Jindo dog is usually kept by humans as a loyal canine companion and guard dog.
The Korean Army is known to use Jindos as guard dogs at major bases. Furthermore, Jindos are instinctively wary of strangers and do not take food from anyone other than their owners.

In a 2009 interview with &quot;Korea Economic Daily&quot; (한국경제), Park Nam-sun (박남순), an expert search dog handler in South Korea, testified that Jindo dogs are not fit as rescue dogs and search dogs. It is because Jindo dogs&#x27; hunting instincts are too strong (they can forget their mission because of their hunting instincts), and they usually give their loyalty only to the first owner, while handlers of search dogs and rescue dogs can frequently change.

In 2010, Son Min-suk (손민석), a member of the Korean Security Forum, wrote that most Korean military dogs were German Shepherds, and that Jindo dogs were not fit for military dogs as they were highly likely to escape their duties to find their first handlers, who might have been discharged from military services, or to come back to their original home.

However, efforts to train Jindo dogs as search and rescue dogs continue. In October 2010, the Los Angeles Police Department announced their intent to evaluate the Jindo dog breed for law enforcement service, specifically for patrol and detection service. Four selected Jindo puppies would be distributed to LAPD and Glendale California Police Department to be trained as K9 units. After a year of trying, the trainers found that the dogs did not have the right disposition for police work because they were too easily distracted and too eager to please their masters.

<doc id="549480" wikidata="Q421877" url="?curid=549480" title="Dragon's blood">
<text>Dragon&#x27;s blood is a bright red resin which is obtained from different species of a number of distinct plant genera: &quot;Calamus&quot; spp. (previously &quot;Daemonorops&quot;) also including &quot;Calamus rotang&quot;, &quot;Croton&quot;, &quot;Dracaena&quot; and &quot;Pterocarpus&quot;. The red resin has been in continuous use since ancient times as varnish, medicine, incense, pigment, and dye.

== Name and source ==

A great degree of confusion existed for the ancients in regard to the source and identity of dragon&#x27;s blood. Some medieval encyclopedias claimed its source as the literal blood of elephants and dragons who had perished in mortal combat. The resin of &quot;Dracaena&quot; species, &quot;true&quot; dragon&#x27;s blood, and the very poisonous mineral cinnabar (mercury sulfide) were often confused by the ancient Romans. In ancient China, little or no distinction was made among the types of dragon&#x27;s blood from the different species. Both &quot;Dracaena&quot; and &quot;Calamus&quot; resins are still often marketed today as dragon&#x27;s blood, with little or no distinction being made between the plant sources; however, the resin obtained from &quot;Calamus&quot; has become the most commonly sold type in modern times, often in the form of large balls of resin. Resins that come from different species and different continents have been given the name “dragon&#x27;s blood,” but their purity, appearance, and chemical properties are highly varied.

Voyagers to the Canary Islands in the 15th century obtained dragon&#x27;s blood as dried garnet-red drops from &quot;Dracaena draco&quot;, a tree native to the Canary Islands and Morocco. The resin is exuded from its wounded trunk or branches. Dragon&#x27;s blood is also obtained by the same method from the closely related &quot;Dracaena cinnabari&quot;, which is endemic to the island of Socotra. This resin was traded to ancient Europe via the Incense Road.

Dragon&#x27;s blood resin is also produced from the rattan palms of the genus &quot;Calamus&quot; of the Indonesian islands and known there as &quot;jernang&quot; or &quot;djernang&quot;. It is gathered by breaking off the layer of red resin encasing the unripe fruit of the rattan. The collected resin is then rolled into solid balls before being sold.

The red latex of the Sangre de Drago (called Sangre de Grado in Peru), from any of seven species of &quot;Croton&quot; native to Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Brazil, has purported wound-healing and antioxidant properties, and has been used for centuries by native people. The species are:

* &quot;Croton draconoides&quot; , ()
* &quot;Croton palanostigma&quot; , ()
* &quot;Croton perpecosus&quot; , ()
* &quot;Croton rimbachii&quot; , ()
* &quot;Croton sampatik&quot; , ()
* &quot;Croton erythrochilus&quot; , ()
* &quot;Croton lechleri&quot; , ()

== Visual characteristics ==
In his study of artists&#x27; pigments, the chemist George Field described dragon&#x27;s blood as “a warm semi-transparent, rather dull, red colour, which is deepened by impure air, and darkened by light.”

== History and uses ==
The dragon&#x27;s blood known to the ancient Romans was mostly collected from &quot;D. cinnabari&quot;, and is mentioned in the 1st century &quot;Periplus Maris Erythraei&quot; (xxx.10.17) as one of the products of Socotra. Socotra had been an important trading centre since at least the time of the Ptolemies. Dragon&#x27;s blood was used as a dye, painting pigment, and medicine (respiratory and gastrointestinal problems) in the Mediterranean basin, and was held by early Greeks, Romans, and Arabs to have medicinal properties. Dioscorides and other early Greek writers described its medicinal uses.
A notable occurrence of dragon&#x27;s blood red in art is in Giotto&#x27;s &quot;Pentecost&quot;. In this painting, it is believed that the pigment used in the orange-red flames over the Apostles&#x27; heads is dragon&#x27;s blood.

Locals on Socotra island use the &quot;Dracaena&quot; resin as a sort of cure-all, using it for such things as general wound healing, a coagulant (though this is ill-advised with commercial products, as the &quot;Calamus&quot; species acts as an anti-coagulant and it is usually unknown what species the dragon&#x27;s blood came from), curing diarrhea, lowering fevers, dysentery diseases, taken internally for ulcers in the mouth, throat, intestines and stomach, as well as an antiviral for respiratory viruses, stomach viruses and for skin disorders such as eczema. It was also used in medieval ritual magic and alchemy.

Dragon&#x27;s blood of both &quot;Dracaena draco&quot; (commonly referred to as the Draconis Palm) and &quot;Dracaena cinnabari&quot; were used as a source of varnish for 18th century Italian violinmakers. There was also an 18th-century recipe for toothpaste that contained dragon&#x27;s blood.

Dragon&#x27;s blood from both &quot;Calamus&quot; were used for ceremonies in India. Sometimes &quot;Dracaena&quot; resin, but more often &quot;Calamus&quot; resin, was used in China as red varnish for wooden furniture. It was also used to colour the surface of writing paper for banners and posters, used especially for weddings and for Chinese New Year.

Dragon&#x27;s blood incense is also occasionally sold as &quot;red rock opium&quot; to unsuspecting would-be drug buyers. It actually contains no opiates, and has only slight psychoactive effects, if any at all.

Thaspine from the Dragon&#x27;s Blood of the species &quot;Croton lechleri&quot; has possible use as a cancer drug.

Today, dragon&#x27;s blood from a South American plant can be bought in health food stores.

According to Pliny the Elder, dragon&#x27;s blood was used by artists in antiquity. Painters continued to use it in the creation of flesh tones during the 17th century. By the 19th century, publications on artists&#x27; materials indicate that it was most useful as a varnish, not as pigment for painting. In 1835, George Field stated that dragon&#x27;s blood is “unsatisfactory for painting.” However, the pigment was used to prepare the color known as &quot;Chinese orange.&quot;

Today, dragon&#x27;s blood has a variety of uses. Outside of it being a pigment in paintings and colors, it is still used as a varnish for violins, in photoengraving, as a medicine, as an incense resin, and as a body oil. The occurrence of bitter taste masking compounds in dragon&#x27;s blood from &quot;Daemonorops draco&quot; indicates the relevance of the species for use in food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries.

== Safety ==
A study on oral toxicity of the DC resin methanol extract taken from the perennial tree &quot;Dracaena cinnabari&quot; was performed on female Sprague Dawley rats in February 2018. Acute and sub-acute oral toxicity tests found that the extract could be tolerated up to 2,000 mg/kg body weight.

<text>Vladimír Šmicer (; born 24 May 1973) is a Czech former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He started his senior career at Slavia Prague, the only Czech club he ever played for. In 1999, Šmicer moved to England where he played for Liverpool, winning multiple honours. He is perhaps best remembered at Liverpool for his long-range goal in the 2005 UEFA Champions League final victory against Milan. At Liverpool he also won an UEFA Cup, FA Cup and League Cup treble in 2001 as well as the 2003 League Cup.

He also notably played for French sides Lens, with whom he won the Ligue 1 title, and Bordeaux.

At international level, Šmicer played once for the Czechoslovak national side and 80 times for the Czech Republic. He retired from professional football in 2009.

==Club career==
===Liverpool===
Šmicer joined Liverpool for a fee of £4.2 million, recruited to fill the void left by the departure of Steve McManaman to Real Madrid. Upon arriving at Anfield in 1999, Šmicer was given the number 7 shirt, although he would later switch to number 11 after the arrival of Harry Kewell. When he left Liverpool in 2005, Šmicer said: &quot;Just signing for Liverpool in itself was a dream because I supported them as a kid. It was a dream come true.&quot; He made his Liverpool debut in a match against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough Stadium and scored his first Premier League goal in a 3–2 away victory against Watford.

Although Šmicer was plagued with injury problems, he scored the last minute winner against Chelsea in 2002, and a stunning volley against Borussia Dortmund

Šmicer also scored Liverpool’s second goal during the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final vs AC Milan. The game ended 3-3, with Liverpool coming back from 3-0 to bring it to penalties. Šmicer would then score Liverpool’s fourth and final penalty to win the game.

===Slavia Prague===
Upon returning to Slavia Prague in 2007, Šmicer won the Personality of the League award at the Czech Footballer of the Year awards in 2008. He ended his football career after a goalless draw against Viktoria Plzeň on 9 November 2009, but made his farewell party on 11 May 2010.

==International career==
Šmicer began his international career in 1993. At the Euro 1996, he represented the Czech Republic as they made it to the finals. He was the Czech’s only substitute in the final, coming on in the 88th minute against Germany to replace Karel Poborský. At the Euro 2000, he scored both goals in the national team&#x27;s only tournament victory, 2–0 against Denmark. Šmicer did not participate in the 2006 FIFA World Cup due to a leg injury.

==Managerial career==
Just one day after retiring from football, Šmicer became sports manager of the Czech national team, working alongside head coach Michal Bílek.

==Personal life==
Šmicer stood for minor Czech party VIZE 2014 in the European Parliament election; his stated priority was to reduce obesity among children. As a result of Šmicer&#x27;s playing career, he can speak English and French apart from his native Czech.

<doc id="549489" wikidata="Q4780009" url="?curid=549489" title="Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex">
<text>The &quot;Aplysia&quot; gill and siphon withdrawal reflex (GSWR) is an involuntary, defensive reflex of the sea hare &quot;Aplysia californica&quot;, a large shell-less sea snail or sea slug. This reflex causes the sea hare&#x27;s delicate siphon and gill to be retracted when the animal is disturbed. 
&quot;Aplysia californica&quot; is used in neuroscience research for studies of the cellular basis of behavior including: habituation, dishabituation, and sensitization, because of the simplicity and relatively large size of the underlying neural circuitry.

Eric Kandel, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000 for his work with &quot;Aplysia californica&quot;, was involved in pioneering research into this reflex in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Nonassociative learning==
Nonassociative learning is a change of the behavior of an animal due to an experience from specific kinds of stimuli. In contrast to associative learning the behavioral change is not caused by the animals learning that a particular temporal association occurs between the stimuli. There are three different forms of nonassociative learning examined in &quot;Aplysia&quot;: habituation, dishabituation and sensitization. Eric Kandel and colleagues were the first to demonstrate that Aplysia californica is capable of displaying both habituation and dishabituation.

Habituation in &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; occurs when a stimulus is repeatedly presented to an animal and there is a progressive decrease in response to that particular stimulus.

Dishabituation in &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; occurs when the animal is presented with another novel stimulus and a partial or complete restoration of a habituated response occurs.

Sensitization in &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; is the increase of a response due to the presentation of a novel, often noxious, stimulus.

==Gill and siphon withdrawal reflex (GSWR)==
A two-component reflex is triggered when a weak or moderate stimulus is applied to the siphon or the mantle shelf. These two components consist of two reflex acts, the siphon-withdrawal reflex and the gill-withdrawal reflex. Together they form a reflex pattern with short latency which protects the animal&#x27;s gill and siphon from potentially threatening stimuli.

Both central ganglia and peripheral neurons are often involved in the neural control of behavior in molluscs. In molluscs such as &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; the peripheral motor neurons are more extensive, as opposed to vertebrates, and innervate somatic (locomotor and appendageal) muscles. Central pathways are activated by weak stimuli applied at some distance from the target effector structure and peripheral pathways are activated when the stimuli is applied at a distance or directly on the target effector structure.

A stimulus to the siphon (weak or moderate) is mediated by abdominal ganglion (55%) and by peripheral motor neurons (45%) and is activated simultaneously.

By using preparations of &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; six central motor neurons have been found in the abdominal ganglion that produce movements of the gill. Stimulation of the cells named L7, LDG1, LDG2 and RDG results in large gill contractions and stimulation of L9G1 and L9G2 produces smaller contractions.

In the abdominal ganglion has seven central motor neurons been found that also produce movements of the siphon. LDS1, LDS2, LDS3, RDS, LBS1, LBS2, and LBS3 control contraction and constriction of the siphon. The siphon is additionally innervated by about 30 peripheral motor neurons.

Kandel and colleagues used preparations of &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; where individuals were restrained in small aquariums in a manner that the gill was exposed. A tactile stimulus was administered to the siphon and elicited the gill and siphon withdrawal reflex. A photocell was placed under the gill to record amplitude and duration of the response elicited by the stimulus.

Habituation was observed when the stimulus was delivered repeatedly to the siphon. Stimulus every 90 seconds resulted in a rapidly declined response. By delivering an electric shock to the tail the response was rapidly restored, and dishabituation occurred. Sensitization was observed when a strong stimulus was administered to the tail, thus enhancing a completely rested reflex in &quot;Aplysia californica&quot;.

<text>Dietmar Johann Wolfgang &quot;Didi&quot; Hamann (; born 27 August 1973) is a German professional football coach, former player and media personality.

Throughout his career, he has played for Bayern Munich, Newcastle United, Liverpool and Manchester City primarily in a defensive midfield position. He also spent time at Milton Keynes Dons as a player/coach before joining Leicester City as a first team coach. He was a member of the Germany national team from 1997 until 2006 and represented his nation in two FIFA World Cups and two UEFA European Championships, reaching the 2002 FIFA World Cup final. He is known in Ireland as a football pundit on Raidió Teilifís Éireann&#x27;s live coverage of major European and International competitions.

Throughout his playing career Hamann gained a reputation for being a highly consistent and reliable player. He is highly respected by supporters of Liverpool due in large part to his involvement in the club&#x27;s victory in the 2005 UEFA Champions League final.

On 5 July 2011, Hamann was named as the new manager of Stockport County, replacing former manager Ray Mathias. He resigned from the post on 7 November 2011 after only four months with Stockport struggling in 17th place in the Conference Premier citing failure of a proposed takeover by Tony Evans.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Hamann began his career at the little-known Wacker München. After impressing as a junior, he joined Bayern Munich as a 16-year-old in 1989 and debuted for the Bayern professional team in 1993. Hamann joined a team led by Lothar Matthäus, Thomas Helmer, Christian Ziege and Oliver Kahn and played five games, mostly as a right winger. At first, Hamann was only a so-called &quot;Vertragsamateur&quot; (i.e. an amateur player who had the licence for playing professional games). Still, he won his first German championship as a bench player. In the next season, Bayern suffered a major injury wave which claimed midfielders Matthäus, Swiss international Alain Sutter, talent Dieter Frey and veteran Markus Schupp, which allowed Hamann to become a regular; he played 30 Bundesliga games and established himself as a valuable role player, playing either right wing or defensive midfield. He earned himself a full professional contract and was an important player in the tumultuous 1995–96 campaign, in which Bayern recruited striker Jürgen Klinsmann, coach Otto Rehhagel and midfielders Andi Herzog, Thomas Strunz and Ciriaco Sforza, but the team was torn apart by heavy internal struggles. Although Hamann was overshadowed by these new midfield recruits, he played in 20 games and provided some stability for the infighting Bayern squad. Bayern ended a disappointing second and saw Rehhagel sacked, but ended the season by winning the UEFA Cup.

The 1996–97 season was to become Hamann&#x27;s breakthrough. After being a bench player most of his career until then, new coach Giovanni Trapattoni made him a starting defensive midfielder, and new recruit Mario Basler took the right wing. Hamann played in 23 games, also making his debut in the Germany national team and won his second Germany championship with Bayern. In his private life, Hamann had to overcome a scary period when he broke down unconscious and was diagnosed with a stroke, but made a full recovery. The next season ended disappointingly for Bayern who lagged behind newly promoted Kaiserslautern for the vast majority of the season and finished second. Now an undisputed starter, Hamann played in 28 games and scored two goals. The season ended on a high for Bayern when they secured the DFB-Pokal against MSV Duisburg.

===Newcastle United===
After playing for his country in the 1998 World Cup, he joined Newcastle United, managed at the time by Kenny Dalglish, for £5.5 million. Overcoming an early foot injury, Hamann played in 31 matches and scored five goals. In July 1999, he opted to join Gerard Houllier&#x27;s Liverpool, who signed him for £8 million.
Whilst at Newcastle he played in the 1999 FA Cup Final.

===Liverpool===
Hamann established himself as an influential midfielder for Liverpool throughout his seven years at the club. All in all, Hamann played in 191 league games and scored eight goals. In the 2000–01 season, Hamann won his first big English trophy when Liverpool won a much-celebrated cup treble (League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup) and a place in the Champions League. Hamann also played the full 90 minutes and assisted Liverpool&#x27;s second goal (scored by Michael Owen) in the team&#x27;s 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the 2003 Worthington Cup final.

Hamann established himself as a major first team player for Liverpool throughout his first few seasons.

Hamann played a major part in the 2005 Champions League Final win over A.C. Milan. Although he was suffering a broken toe during the final, Hamann&#x27;s substitution for Steve Finnan at half time was the catalyst for Liverpool&#x27;s historic fightback. The team rallied after being 3–0 down to bring the game back to 3–3 and finally won in the penalty shootout; Hamann also showed a great amount of composure and bravery, as he took and converted the first Liverpool penalty with his broken foot. This was not the only key part he played in their Champions league success. Earlier in the tournament, Hamann had been forced to stand in for Liverpool&#x27;s key player Steven Gerrard in the first leg of the last 16 round against Bayer Leverkusen. He excelled in the match and scored a late free-kick as Liverpool won the match 3–1.

Hamann won the FA Cup with Liverpool in May 2006, coming on as a substitute in the second-half. He more than played his part in another trophy win for the Reds, who were 3–2 down to West Ham United at the time he came on. Steven Gerrard scored an injury-time leveller for Liverpool to take the match to extra-time. Liverpool would go on to win the Cup on penalties after a goalless extra-time. Once again, Hamann scored the first penalty in the shoot-out. When it was clear his time at Liverpool was coming to a close, David Moyes, the manager of Liverpool&#x27;s rival club Everton, called him to try and convince him to join the club, but Hamann refused, saying: “David, I appreciate the interest, but, after all the years I&#x27;ve had at Liverpool and the things I&#x27;ve experienced, it&#x27;s just not possible to join Everton&quot;.

===Manchester City===

In June 2006, Hamann was given permission to talk to Bolton Wanderers about a potential transfer to the North West club. Hamann admitted that he would be saddened to leave Liverpool but would make &quot;the best decision for my future&quot;. Hamann actually signed a pre-contract in June 2006, to become a Bolton Wanderers player but had a &quot;change of heart&quot;. He joined Bolton for less than one day before a move to Manchester City.

On 12 July, he instead signed for Manchester City, with City agreeing to pay £400,000 compensation to Bolton. On 13 February, he signed a contract until the end of the 2008–09 season and scored his first goal for the club in a UEFA Cup qualifying first round match against EB/Streymur.

However, on 28 August 2013 during Colin Murray&#x27;s morning radio show with TalkSport Bolton Wanderers chairman Phil Gartside announced that the club had never officially signed the midfielder and that they had &quot;put (the papers) in the drawer&quot;. A Premier League investigation found that this wasn&#x27;t the case and that Bolton had indeed signed Hamann, and expressed confusion as to why Gartside had lied about it.

On 1 July 2009, he was released by Manchester City as his contract expired. Hamann announced on 16 July that he intended to stay in England.

On transfer deadline day in September 2009, BBC Sport quoted Hamann as stating: &quot;Yes, Sven [-Göran Eriksson] phoned me the other day to see if I wanted to sign for Notts County, but I said I wasn&#x27;t interested at the moment as I feel I can still play at a higher level. There are a couple of things in Germany and I&#x27;ll make my mind up by the end of the week. I have spoken to a couple of teams in England but that hasn&#x27;t come to anything yet. Obviously, I can still sign after the deadline so maybe if teams don&#x27;t get the players they want today then I will hear something&quot;.

===Milton Keynes Dons===
On 20 May 2010, Hamann signed a one-year contract as a player-coach at Milton Keynes Dons but only made 12 appearances as a player. When he left the club on 3 February 2011 to join Leicester City as a First Team Coach, he effectively retired from a playing career.

===Comeback as player with TuS Haltern===
After retiring in February 2011 and managing Stockport County in July 2011, Hamann went back to playing football, and this time for amateur-side TuS Haltern. He signed a contract with the club on 7 March 2015 at the age of 41.

==International career==
Hamann played for Germany at under-21 level before making his full international debut in a friendly against South Africa in November 1997. He was selected by manager Berti Vogts for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, being, at almost 25, the second youngest player in an over-aged Germany squad. During the group stage, Hamann drifted in and out of the starting XI, finally breaking into the team when Germany gained momentum in the second round game against Mexico. However, after a quarter-final defeat against Croatia, Germany was out of the tournament.

During the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying, Hamann established himself as a key player for a transitional Germany side. He played in all of Germany&#x27;s games at the final tournament as they exited in the first round. Hamann was the last player to score at the old Wembley Stadium before its demolition when he scored the winning goal in Germany&#x27;s 2002 World Cup qualifier against England in October 2000.

Alongside Michael Ballack and Bernd Schneider, Hamann was one of the key players in Germany&#x27;s surprising run to the 2002 FIFA World Cup Final. He became only the second Liverpool player after Roger Hunt in 1966 to play in a World Cup Final while still at the club, but finished on the losing side as Brazil won 2–0 in Yokohama. In the 67th minute of that match, Hamann lost the ball to opposing forward Ronaldo, who passed to Rivaldo, who shot from outside the area; goalkeeper Oliver Kahn gave a rebound, allowing Ronaldo to score and give Brazil a 1–0 lead. The subsequent Euro 2004 turned out to be Hamann&#x27;s last tournament. Again, the Euro ended with a disappointing first round exit for Germany. A 1–2 defeat against a Czech Republic side resting its key players proved to be Hamann&#x27;s penultimate international game.

After a strong performance in the 2005 Champions League final, Hamann was recalled for the Germany squad by new manager Jürgen Klinsmann. In the 2–2 draw against the Netherlands, Hamann produced a lacklustre performance, apparently convincing Klinsmann that he did not possess the required pace for that kind of level anymore. Hamann was dropped from the squad for the subsequent friendlies. Having not been selected for the German squad in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he decided to officially retire from international football.

==Coaching and management career==

===Milton Keynes Dons and Leicester City===

On 20 May 2010, Hamann signed a one-year contract as a player-coach at Milton Keynes Dons. He left the club on 3 February 2011 to join Leicester City as a First Team Coach.

===Stockport County ===
On 5 July 2011, Hamann was appointed as the new manager of newly relegated Conference Premier club Stockport County, replacing Ray Mathias. His appointment was made after businessman Tony Evans headed a consortium proposing taking over the club. In his first league game in charge of Stockport, Hamann&#x27;s side drew 1–1 with Forest Green Rovers at The New Lawn. The match was broadcast live on Premier Sports. Hamann resigned as Stockport County boss on 7 November 2011, citing the failure of the proposed takeover by Tony Evans to materialise; his team were languishing in 17th place having taken only three wins from his nineteen league games in charge.

==Broadcasting career==
Hamann was enlisted by RTÉ Sport for their squad of pundits ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He returned to RTÉ&#x27;s team during UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

More recently, in neighbouring Britain, Hamann has guested as a pundit on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot;. He has also appeared on Sky Sports&#x27;s football coverage as a pundit, usually when the match involves a club he has played for, most commonly Liverpool, and has also appeared regularly on LFC TV during their live pre-game and post game analysis of Liverpool home games from Anfield.

He was again part of RTÉ Sport&#x27;s studio coverage for the finals of UEFA Euro 2016, beginning with an appearance for the opening night match between tournament hosts France and Romania. In assessing Ireland&#x27;s chances for the tournament, Hamann also said he had been in Dublin to see Ireland beat world champions Germany during the qualifying campaign.

He was additionally retained by RTÉ Sport as a studio pundit for Champions League and Irish International games for the full football season 2016–2017, having been an occasional pundit on Champions League matches during the 2015-16 season.

He was back on the RTÉ Panel again for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the rescheduled UEFA Euro 2020 in 2021, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and UEFA Euro 2024.

Hamann also works as a pundit for Sky Sports Bundesliga in Germany.

==Writing==
Hamann is also the European columnist for &quot;twentyfour7&quot;, where he passes regular comment on the progress and state of the game on the continent.

He released his autobiography, &quot;The Didi Man: My Love Affair with Liverpool&quot;, co-written with Malcolm McClean, in February 2012 and it became a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Best Seller.

==Personal life==
Hamann has two daughters, Chiara and Luna. He is the brother of Matthias Hamann, who also played in the Bundesliga, mainly for Bayern rival 1860 Munich. Hamann enjoys cricket and once played for Alderley Edge CC 2nd XI vs Neston CC 2nd XI in the Cheshire County Cricket League, taking a catch in the game. He became interested in the sport during the 2005 Ashes series.

On 23 February 2010, the former German international was found guilty of Driving under the influence and sentenced to a 16-month driving ban while also being fined nearly £2,000. He had been stopped by police at junction six of the M56 near his home in Styal, Cheshire, at 12.15 am on 12 July 2009.

In cooperation with Standard Chartered Bank, an institution for which he also acted as an ambassador, Hamann hosted a football clinic in Nigeria.

In 2012, Hamann revealed the gambling problems he suffered towards the end of his career, an addiction that has been &quot;not healthy or sustainable&quot; and lasted for many years.

Hamann went to Australia on an extended holiday in 2018. In June 2019 he was charged with assault in the country.

<doc id="549494" wikidata="Q51153" url="?curid=549494" title="Árpád dynasty">
<text>The Árpád dynasty consisted of the members of the royal House of Árpád (), also known as Árpáds (, ). They were the ruling dynasty of the Principality of Hungary in the 9th and 10th centuries and of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1000 to 1301. The dynasty was named after the Hungarian Grand Prince Árpád who was the head of the Hungarian tribal federation during the conquest of the Carpathian Basin, c. 895. Previously, it was referred to as the Turul dynasty or kindred.

Both the first Grand Prince of the Hungarians (Álmos) and the first king of Hungary (Saint Stephen) were members of the dynasty. Christianity was adopted as the state religion for the Kingdom of Hungary by the dynasty, and the Árpád&#x27;s kings used the title of the apostolic king, the descendants of the dynasty gave the world the highest number of saints and blesseds from one family. The Árpád dynasty ruled the Carpathian Basin for four hundred years, influencing almost all of Europe through its extensive dynastic connections. Eight members of the dynasty were canonized or beatified by the Catholic Church; therefore, since the 13th century the dynasty has often been referred to as the Kindred of the Holy Kings. Two Árpáds were recognized as Saints by the Eastern Orthodox Church.

The dynasty came to end in 1301 with the death of King Andrew III of Hungary, while the last member of the House of Árpád, Andrew&#x27;s daughter, Blessed Elizabeth of Töss, died in 1336 or 1338. All of the subsequent kings of Hungary (with the exception of King Matthias Corvinus) were cognatic descendants of the Árpád dynasty. The House of Croÿ and the Drummond family of Scotland claim to descend from Géza and George, sons of medieval Hungarian kings: Géza II and Andrew I, respectively.

== Anthropology and genetics ==

According to recent Y-STR and Y-SNP archaeogenetic studies of the skeletal remains of dynasty descendant and King Béla III of Hungary and unknown Árpád member named as &quot;II/52&quot; / &quot;HU52&quot; from the Royal Basilica of Székesfehérvár, it was established that the male lineage belonged to the Y-haplogroup R1a rare subclade R-Z2125 &gt; R-Z2123 &gt; R-Y2632 &gt; R-Y2633 &gt; R1a-SUR51. The subclade was also found in nearest contemporary matches of 48 Bashkirs from the Burzyansky and Abzelilovsky districts of the Republic of Bashkortostan in the Volga-Ural region, and 1 individual from the region of Vojvodina, Serbia. The Árpád members and one individual from Serbia share additional private SNPs making a novel subclade R1a-SUR51 &gt; R-ARP, and as the mentioned individual has additional private SNPs it branches from the medieval Árpáds forming R-ARP &gt; R-UVD.

Based on the data of the distribution, appearance and coalescence estimation of R-Y2633 the dynasty traces ancient origin near Northern Afghanistan about 4500 years ago, with a separation date of R-ARP from the closest kin Bashkirs from the Volga-Ural region to 2000 years ago, while the individual from Serbia (R-UVD) derives from the Árpáds about 900 years ago. As also the separation of haplogroup N-B539 between the Hungarians and Bashkirs is estimated to have occurred 2000 years ago, it implies that the ancestors of Hungarians left the Volga Ural region about 2000 years ago and started a migration that eventually culminated in settlement in the Carpathian Basin.

==9th and 10th centuries==
Medieval chroniclers stated that the Árpáds&#x27; forefather was Ügyek, whose name derived from the ancient Hungarian word for &quot;holy&quot; (&quot;igy&quot;). The &quot;Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum&quot; (&quot;The Deeds of the Huns and Hungarians&quot;) mentioned that the Árpáds descended from the &quot;gens&quot; (clan) Turul, and the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; (&quot;The Deeds of the Hungarians&quot;) recorded that the Árpáds&#x27; totemic ancestor was a &quot;turul&quot; (a large bird, probably a falcon).
 

Medieval chroniclers also referred to a tradition that the Árpáds descended from Attila the Hun – the anonymous author of the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;, for example, has Árpád say: 

The first member of the dynasty mentioned by a nearly contemporary written source was Álmos. The Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII recorded in his &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; that Álmos was the first Grand Prince of the federation of the seven Magyar tribes (&quot;megas Turkias arkhon&quot;). Álmos probably accepted the supremacy of the Khagan of the Khazars in the beginning of his rule, but, by 862, the Magyar tribal federation broke free from the Khazar Khaganate. Álmos was either the spiritual leader of the tribal federation (&quot;kende&quot;) or its military commander (&quot;gyula&quot;).

The Hungarians took possession of the Carpathian Basin in a pre-planned manner, with a long move-in between 862–895. Prince Álmos, the sacred leader of the Hungarian Great Principality died before he could reach Pannonia, he was sacrificed in Transylvania.

Between 899 and 970, the Magyars frequently conducted raids into the territories of present-day Italy, Germany, France and Spain and into the lands of the Byzantine Empire. Such activities continued westwards until the Battle of Lechfeld (955), when Otto, King of the Germans destroyed their troops; their raids against the Byzantine Empire ended in 970.

From 917, the Magyars made raids into several territories at the same time, which may have led to the disintegration of their tribal federation. The sources prove the existence of at least three and possibly five groups of tribes within the tribal federation, and only one of them was led directly by the Árpáds.

The list of the Grand Princes of the Magyars in the first half of the 10th century is incomplete, which may also prove a lack of central government within their tribal federation. The medieval chronicles mention that Grand Prince Árpád was followed by his son, Zoltán, but contemporary sources only refer to Grand Prince Fajsz (around 950). After the defeat at the Battle of Lechfeld, Grand Prince Taksony (in or after 955 – before 972) adopted the policy of isolation from the Western countries – in contrast to his son, Grand Prince Géza (before 972–997) who may have sent envoys to Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor in 973.

Géza was baptised in 972, and although he never became a convinced Christian, the new faith started to spread among the Hungarians during his reign. He managed to expand his rule over the territories west of the Danube and the Garam (today &quot;Hron&quot; in Slovakia), but significant parts of the Carpathian Basin still remained under the rule of local tribal leaders.

Géza was followed by his son Stephen (originally called Vajk), who had been a convinced follower of Christianity. Stephen had to face the rebellion of his relative, Koppány, who claimed Géza&#x27;s inheritance based on the Magyar tradition of agnatic seniority. He was able to defeat Koppány with the assistance of the German retinue of his wife, Giselle of Bavaria.

== 11th century ==
The Grand Prince Stephen was crowned on 25 December 1000 or 1 January 1001, becoming the first King of Hungary (1000–1038) and founder of the state. He unified the Carpathian Basin under his rule by 1030, subjugating the territories of the Black Magyars and the domains that had been ruled by (semi-)independent local chieftains (&quot;e.g.&quot;, by the &quot;Gyula&quot; Prokuj, Ajtony). He introduced the administrative system of the kingdom, based on counties &quot;(comitatus)&quot;, and founded an ecclesiastic organization with two archbishoprics and several bishoprics. Following the death of his son, Emeric (2 September 1031), King Stephen I assigned his sister&#x27;s son, the Venetian Peter Orseolo as his heir which resulted in a conspiracy led by his cousin, Vazul, who had been living imprisoned in Nyitra (today &quot;Nitra&quot; in Slovakia). Vazul was blinded on King Stephen&#x27;s order and his three sons (Levente, Andrew and Béla) were exiled.

When King Stephen I died on 15 August 1038, Peter Orseolo ascended to the throne, but he had to struggle with King Stephen&#x27;s brother-in-law, Samuel Aba (1041–1044). King Peter&#x27;s rule ended in 1046 when an extensive revolt of the pagan Hungarians broke out and he was captured by them.

With the assistance of the pagans, Duke Vazul&#x27;s son, Andrew, who had been living in exile in the Kievan Rus&#x27; and had been baptized there, seized power and was crowned; thus, a member of a collateral branch of the dynasty seized the crown. King Andrew I (1046–1060) managed to pacify the pagan rebels and restore the position of Christianity in the kingdom. In 1048, King Andrew invited his younger brother, Béla to the kingdom and conceded one-third of the counties of the kingdom &quot;(Tercia pars regni)&quot; in appanage to him. This dynastic division of the kingdom, mentioned as the first one in the &quot;Chronicon Pictum&quot; &quot;(prima regni huius divisio)&quot;, was followed by several similar divisions during the 11th through 13th centuries, when parts of the kingdom were governed by members of the Árpád dynasty. In the 11th century, the counties entrusted to the members of the ruling dynasty did not form a separate province within the kingdom, but they were organized around two or three centers. The dukes governing the &quot;Tercia pars regni&quot; accepted the supremacy of the kings of Hungary, but some of them (Béla, Géza and Álmos) rebelled against the king in order to acquire the crown and allied themselves with the rulers of the neighboring countries.

King Andrew I was the first king who had his son, Solomon crowned during his life in order to ensure his son&#x27;s succession (1057). However, the principle of agnatic primogeniture was not able to overcome the tradition of seniority, and following King Andrew I, his brother, King Béla I (1060–1063) acquired the throne despite the claims of the young Solomon. From 1063 until 1080 there were frequent conflicts between King Solomon (1057–1080) and his cousins, Géza, Ladislaus and Lampert who governed the &quot;Tercia pars regni&quot;. Duke Géza rebelled against his cousin in 1074 and was proclaimed king by his partisans in accordance with the principle of seniority. When King Géza I died (25 April 1077) his partisans, disregarding his young sons, proclaimed his brother Ladislaus king.
King Ladislaus I (1077–1095) managed to persuade King Solomon, who had been ruling in some western counties, to abdicate the throne. During his reign, the Kingdom of Hungary strengthened and Ladislaus I was able to expand his rule over neighboring Kingdom of Croatia (1091). He entrusted the government of the newly occupied territories to his younger nephew, Álmos.

On 20 August 1083, two members of the dynasty, King Stephen I and his son, Duke Emeric, were canonized in Székesfehérvár upon the initiative of King Ladislaus I. His daughter Eirene, the wife of the Byzantine Emperor John II Komnenos, is venerated by the Eastern Orthodox Church.

When King Ladislaus I died, his elder nephew Coloman was proclaimed king (1095–1116), but he had to concede the &quot;Tercia pars regni&quot; in appanage to his brother Álmos. King Coloman defeated Croatian army led by Petar Snačić in Battle of Gvozd Mountain (1097) and was crowned King of Croatia and Dalmatia in 1102 in Biograd.

==12th century==
King Coloman deprived his brother Álmos of his duchy (the &quot;Tercia pars regni&quot;) in 1107. He caught his second wife, Eufemia of Kiev, in adultery; she was divorced and sent back to Kiev around 1114. Eufemia bore a son, named Boris in Kiev, but King Coloman refused to accept him as his son. Around 1115, the king had Duke Álmos and his son, King Béla, blinded in order to ensure the succession of his own son, King Stephen II (1116–1131).

King Stephen II did not father any sons, and his sister&#x27;s son Saul was proclaimed heir to his throne instead of the blind Duke Béla. When King Stephen II died on 1 March 1131, his blind cousin managed nevertheless to acquire the throne. King Béla II (1131–1141) strengthened his rule by defeating King Coloman&#x27;s alleged son, Boris, who endeavoured to deprive him of the throne with foreign military assistance. King Béla II occupied some territories in Bosnia, and he conceded the new territory in appanage to his younger son, Ladislaus. Henceforward, members of the Árpád dynasty governed southern or eastern provinces (&quot;i.e.&quot;, Slavonia, and Transylvania) of the kingdom instead of the &quot;Tercia pars regni&quot;.
During the reign of King Géza II (1141–1162), the Bishop Otto of Freising recorded that all the Hungarians &quot;are so obedient to the monarch that not only irritating him by open opposition but even offending him by concealed whispers would be considered a felony by them&quot;. His son, King Stephen III (1162–1172) had to struggle for his throne against his uncles, Kings Ladislaus II (1162–1163) and Stephen IV (1163–1165), who rebelled against him with the assistance of the Byzantine Empire. During his reign, the Emperor Manuel I Komnenos occupied the southern provinces of the kingdom on the pretext that the king&#x27;s brother, Béla (the &quot;Despotes&quot; Alexius) lived in his court. As the fiancé of the Emperor&#x27;s only daughter, &quot;Despotes&quot; Alexius was the heir presumptive to the Emperor for a short period (1165–1169).
Following the death of King Stephen III, King Béla III (1173–1196) ascended the throne, but he had imprisoned his brother Géza in order to secure his rule. King Béla III, who had been educated in the Byzantine Empire, was the first king who used the &quot;double cross&quot; as the symbol of the Kingdom of Hungary. 
In 1188, Béla occupied Halych, whose prince had been dethroned by his boyars, and granted the principality to his second son Andrew, but his rule became unpopular and the Hungarian troops were expelled from Halych in 1189.

On 27 June 1192 the third member of the dynasty, King Ladislaus I was canonized in Várad (today &quot;Oradea&quot; in Romania).

King Béla III bequeathed his kingdom intact to his elder son, King Emeric (1196–1204), but the new king had to concede Croatia and Dalmatia in appanage to his brother Andrew, who had rebelled against him.

==13th century==

King Emeric married Constance of Aragon, from the house of Barcelona, and he may have followed Barcelonese (Catalan) patterns when he chose his coat-of-arms that would become the Árpáds&#x27; familiar badge (an escutcheon barry of eight Gules and Argent). His son and successor, King Ladislaus III (1204–1205) died in childhood and was followed by his uncle, King Andrew II (1205–1235).

His reign was characterized by permanent internal conflicts: a group of conspirators murdered his queen, Gertrude of Merania (1213); discontent noblemen obliged him to issue the Golden Bull of 1222 establishing their rights (including the right to disobey the king); and he quarreled with his eldest son, Béla who endeavoured to take back the royal domains his father had granted to his followers. King Andrew II, who had been Prince of Halych (1188–1189), intervened regularly in the internal struggles of the principality and made several efforts to ensure the rule of his younger sons (Coloman or Andrew) in the neighboring country. One of his daughters, Elizabeth was canonized during his lifetime (1 July 1235) and thus became the fourth saint of the Árpáds. King Andrew&#x27;s elder sons disowned his posthumous son, Stephen, who would be educated in Ferrara.

Members of the family reigned occasionally in the Principality (later Kingdom) of Halych (1188–1189, 1208–1209, 1214–1219, 1227–1229, 1231–1234) and in the Duchy of Styria (1254–1260).

King Béla IV (1235–1270) restored the royal power, but his kingdom became devastated during the Mongol invasion (1241–1242). Following the withdrawal of the Mongol troops, several fortresses were built or enstrengthened on his order. He also granted town privileges to several settlements in his kingdom, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Buda, Nagyszombat (today &quot;Trnava&quot; in Slovakia), Selmecbánya (now &quot;Banská Štiavnica&quot; in Slovakia) and Pest received their privileges from him. King Béla IV managed to occupy the Duchy of Styria for a short period (1254–1260), but later he had to abandon it in favour of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. During his last years, he was struggling with his son, Stephen who was crowned during his lifetime and obliged his father to concede the eastern parts of the kingdom to him. Two of his daughters, Margaret and Kinga were canonized (in 1943 and 1999 respectively) and a third daughter of his, Yolanda was beatified (in 1827). His fourth daughter, Constance was also venerated in Lviv.

When King Stephen V (1270–1272) ascended the throne, many of his father&#x27;s followers left for Bohemia. They returned during the reign of his son, King Ladislaus IV the Cuman (1272–1290) whose reign was characterized by internal conflicts among the members of different aristocratic groups. King Ladislaus IV, whose mother was of Cuman origin, preferred the companion of the nomadic and semi-pagan Cumans; therefore, he was excommunicated several times, but he was murdered by Cuman assassins. The disintegration of the kingdom started during his reign when several aristocrats endeavoured to acquire possessions on the account of the royal domains.

When King Ladislaus IV died, most of his contemporaries thought that the dynasty of the Árpáds had come to an end, because the only patrilineal descendant of the family, Andrew, was the son of Duke Stephen, the posthumous son of King Andrew II who had been disowned by his brothers. Nevertheless, Duke Andrew &quot;the Venetian&quot; was crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary and most of the barons accepted his rule. During his reign, King Andrew III (1290–1301) had to struggle with the powerful barons (&quot;e.g.&quot;, with members of the Csák and Kőszegi families). The male line of the Árpáds ended with his death (14 January 1301); one of his contemporaries mentioned him as &quot;the last golden twig&quot;. His daughter, Elizabeth, the last member of the family, died on 6 May 1338; she is venerated by the Roman Catholic Church.

Following the death of King Andrew III, several claimants started to struggle for the throne; finally, King Charles I (the grandson of King Stephen V&#x27;s daughter) managed to strengthen his position around 1310. Henceforward, all the kings of Hungary (with the exception of King Matthias Corvinus) were matrilineal or cognate descendants of the Árpáds. Although the agnatic Árpáds have died out, their cognatic descendants live everywhere in the aristocratic families of Europe.

==Saints==
Several members of the dynasty were canonized or beatified by the Catholic Church or by Eastern Orthodox Church, therefore, since the medieval times the dynasty has often been referred to as the &quot;Lineage of the Holy Kings&quot;. Although the male branch of the Árpád dynasty extinct in 1301, the female branch lived much longer, and the Hungarian Anjou monarchs (King Charles I, King Louis I), and Sigismund of Luxembourg were proud to claim themselves members of the “Clan of Holy Kings” in their times. The Árpád dynasty gave the world the most saints and blessed from a single family.

The following members of the Árpád dynasty were canonized or beatified:

<text>The agricultural history of Peru includes agriculture, cultivation of plants and herbs and general changes in the history of farming in Peru or its historical regions.

== Pre-history ==
Much of the pre-history of Peru was driven by the location of farmable land. The most populated coastal regions of Peru are the two parallel mountain ranges and the series of 20 to 30 rivers descending through its coastal desert. In dry periods only the mountains had enough rainfall for agriculture while the desert coast was empty.

In wet periods many cultures thrived along the rivers. The Inca were a mountain-based culture that expanded when the climate became wetter, often sending conquered peoples down from the mountains into fallow but farmable lowlands. In contrast, the Moche were a lowland culture that died out after a strong El Niño, which caused abnormally high rainfall and floods followed by a long drought.

A study reported that crops of squash, peanuts, and cotton were domesticated in Peru around 10,000, 8,500, and 6,000 years ago, respectively. They were grown by the Ñanchoc people in the Ñanchoc Valley. No earlier instances of the farming of these crops are known.

=== Humboldt current ===
Peru is both afflicted and blessed by a peculiar climate due to the Humboldt Current. Before over fishing killed its fishery, Peru had the world&#x27;s most productive fishery due to the cold Current. It lifts nutrients from the Pacific floor to surface waters. On land, it results in a cold mist that covers coastal Peru to the extent that desert plants have adapted to obtain water from the air instead of from (infrequent) rainfall. The wet side soil is thin, while few rivers operate on the dry side. This means all the water must be brought from the Atlantic side of the Andean mountain ranges that split Peru.

Many obstacles limited Peru&#x27;s agricultural production. Peru has always been rich in natural resources such as tin, silver, gold, guano and rubber. These resources were found, not grown. Train tracks did not connect its peoples; instead they connected the sources of these valuable resources to the sea. So few ways helped to bring agricultural products to market.

The road system is underdeveloped in Peru, e.g., offering no connection to neighboring Brazil. Only a little over a quarter of the 15th-century Inca road system has been modernized. Another obstacle is the large size of Peru&#x27;s informal economy. This prevents Peru from relying on an income tax to run the government. Much of its revenue instead comes from a 13% tax on gross agricultural sales. This squeezes Peruvian farmers who must compete with farmers in countries that tax farmers on net profit. No profit, no tax.

Twenty-first century Peru grows agricultural commodities such as asparagus, potatoes, maize, rice, quinoa and coffee. Peru provides half of the world supply of quinoa. Peruvian agriculture uses synthetic fertilizers rather than still-abundant guano due to infrastructure issues. Peruvian maize is not exportable due to large producer subsidies in Europe and the United States. Coffee is exportable, because little is grown in those countries. In recent years Peru has become the world&#x27;s primary source of high-quality organic coffee. Peru does not have a quality control program such as Kenya&#x27;s, but its government has worked to educate farmers on how to improve quality. Despite the glut of coffee in the market today, coffee production in Peru&#x27;s unusual high altitudes and partial shade allows &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; to flourish, and it has much more of such land available than competitors such as Jamaica and Hawaii.

==Aqueducts and terraces==
The ancient people of Peru built water-moving and preserving technologies like the aqueducts of Cumbe Mayo ( 1500 BCE) and the Nazca&#x27;s underground aqueducts called Puquios (date uncertain), or the terraced gardens of the Huari. Aqueducts were also utilized by the Moche.

Another technique used for farming was terracing. The Chavin, Moche, and Incas built terraces, or andenes, into the sides of hills. The andenes reduced erosion that would normally damage a steep hill. These terraces are still used. Incans irrigated their fields with a system of reservoirs and cisterns to collect water, which was then distributed by canals and ditches.

However, by the mid-19th century, only 3% of Peru&#x27;s land was still farmable. It lagged behind many other South American countries in agriculture.

==Guano==
In the 19th century the Inca fertilizer guano (saltpetre) became the most important resource in Peru&#x27;s modern history, for its use as a fertilizer and as gunpowder. The stock of guano built up because the Humboldt current once drew thousands of anchovies and other fish, which in turn, attracted thousands of birds. The population of white-breasted cormorants, gray pelicans and piqueros flourished due to a lack of predators. The guano (droppings) left by the birds retained its nitrate content because of the arid climate. Between 1840 and 1880, Peru sold around 20 million tons of guano, mostly to Great Britain. Peru earned about 2 billion dollars in profit.

Peru lost its guano reserves to Chile (backed by the British Empire) in the War of the Pacific. By the late 19th century, 50% of the Peruvian government&#x27;s revenue was going to pay off loans that had been guaranteed with guano sources taken by Chile - these debts were eventually paid by sending all the remaining guano to France when it was preparing for war. The Germans invented the Haber process shortly after the outbreak of World War I, after which guano became almost worthless.

As Peru&#x27;s guano reserves began to run out, the government restricted the guano industry to help stabilize the supplies. The collapse of Peru&#x27;s bird population after the collapse of the fishery limited future supply of the fertilizer.

==Current production==
Peru is one of the 5 largest producers of avocado, blueberry, artichoke and asparagus, one of the 10 largest producers in the world of coffee and cocoa, one of the 15 largest producers in the world of potato and pineapple, and also has a considerable production of grape, sugarcane, rice, banana, maize and cassava; its agriculture is considerably diversified.

In 2018, Peru produced 10.3 million tons of sugarcane, 5.1 million tons of potato, 3.5 million tons of rice, 2.2 million tons of banana, 1.5 million tons of maize, 1.2 million tons of cassava, 921 thousand tons of palm oil, 645 thousand tons of grape, 548 thousand tons of pineapple, 504 thousand tons of avocado, 481 thousand tons of tangerine, 502 thousand tons of orange, 369 thousand tons of coffee, 383 thousand tons of mango, 360 thousand tons of asparagus, 270 thousand tons of lemon, 252 thousand tons of tomato, 207 thousand tons of barley, 195 thousand tons of wheat, 188 thousand tons of olives, 187 thousand tons of carrots, 175 thousand tons of papaya, 175 thousand tons of pepper, 154 thousand tons of artichoke, 140 thousand tons of apple, 134 thousand tons of cocoa, in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.

There is also native agriculture and tools, such as the tacarpo, a tool used to cultivate &quot;Pachyrhizus tuberosus&quot; by the people in the Peruvian Amazon.

<text>Bonosus (died AD 280) was a late 3rd-century Roman usurper. He was born in Hispania (Roman Spain) to a British father and Gallic mother. His father—a rhetorician and &quot;teacher of letters&quot;—died when Bonosus was still young but the boy&#x27;s mother gave him a decent education. He had a distinguished military career with an excellent service record. He rose successively through the ranks and tribuneships but, while he was stationed in charge of the Rhenish fleet , the Germans managed to set it on fire. Fearful of the consequences, he proclaimed himself Roman emperor at Colonia Agrippina (Cologne) jointly with Proculus. After a protracted struggle, he was defeated by Marcus Aurelius Probus and hanged himself rather than face capture.

Bonosus left behind a wife and two sons who were treated with honor by Probus.

<text>A stile is a structure or opening that provides passage for humansrather than animals such as livestockover or through a boundary. Common forms include steps, ladders, or narrow gaps. Stiles are often built in rural areas along footpaths, fences, walls, or hedges that enclose domestic animals.

==Types==
In the United Kingdom many stiles were built under legal compulsion (see Rights of way in the United Kingdom). Recent changes in UK government policy towards farming have encouraged upland landowners to make access more available to the public, and this has seen an increase in the number of stiles and an improvement in their overall condition. However stiles are deprecated and are increasingly being replaced by gates or kissing gates or, where the field is arable, the stile removed. Many legacy stiles remain, however, in a variety of forms (as is also the case in the US, where there is no standard). As well as having a variety of forms, modern stiles also sometimes include a &#x27;dog latch&#x27; or &#x27;dog gate&#x27; to the side of them, which can be lifted to enable a dog to get through.
Where footpaths cross dry stone walls in England a squeeze stile is sometimes found, a vertical gap in the wall, usually no more than wide, often formed by stone pillars on either side to protect the structure of the wall.

<doc id="549524" wikidata="Q4296937" url="?curid=549524" title="Mitki">
<text>The Mitki (; ) are an art group in St. Petersburg, Russia.

==The Mitki movement==
The Mitki movement originally emerged from Vladimir Shinkarev’s literary work &quot;Mitki&quot;, which consists of eight chapters. The first five chapters were written between 1984 and 1985, though the book was not finished until four years later. The complete version was officially published in 1990. It encompasses a collection of ironic and absurd essays, anecdotes, conversations and opinions on different cultural subjects, which extend artistic sensibility and development into a comprehensive and cohesive life philosophy that even includes a specifically developed language. Although Mitki is fictional it draws on the characteristics of real people, combining these to create Mityok, the archetypal member of the Mitki group who acts on the instructions provided by the Mitki script. The Mitki group consisted of a number of St. Petersburg friends and artists of which were the main members Vladimir Shinkarev, Alexander Florensky and Dmitri Shagin. Shinkarev&#x27;s eponymous book supplied the group with the manifesto for their emergent movement.

The first collective exhibition of Mitki paintings in 1984 ended peacefully, but the second in St. Petersburg was raided by police. After Glasnost the group&#x27;s work became accepted and was soon shown beyond St. Petersburg. &quot;Mitki&quot;, written before and after Mikhail Gorbachev’s Perestroika in 1987, expresses the transitions and associated anxieties of its time. Shinkarev and Florensky both left the Mitki group to develop their own work in the new Russia.

The Mitki do not promote specific artistic principles, being instead united by a certain collective spirit: an optimistic and straightforward 
world-view, representation of the wide breadth of the Russian soul, respect for art, humour and freedom. Their official slogan is &quot;The Mitki don&#x27;t want to defeat anybody, which is why they will conquer the world.&quot;

===Mitki-Mayer===

In 1992, the group released a 54-minute animated film called &quot;Mitki-Mayer&quot;. Directed by A. Vassilyev, the film&#x27;s plot focuses on a rich American named Mr. Mayer reading the &quot;Mitki&quot; book. After Mr. Mayer witnesses a Russian man who cannot swim jump from a ship in a futile attempt to rescue a woman, he visits his cabin to find out what kind of man he was, where he finds the &quot;Mitki&quot; book. Most of the rest of the film is spent illustrating each of the book&#x27;s chapters. Finally, having finished the book, Mr. Mayer decides to go to Russia, gives up his riches, and joins the Mitki movement. The film was released on video.

<doc id="549530" wikidata="Q7512728" url="?curid=549530" title="Signal reconstruction">
<text>In signal processing, reconstruction usually means the determination of an original continuous signal from a sequence of equally spaced samples.

This article takes a generalized abstract mathematical approach to signal sampling and reconstruction. For a more practical approach based on band-limited signals, see Whittaker–Shannon interpolation formula.

== General principle ==

Let &quot;F&quot; be any sampling method, i.e. a linear map from the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions formula_1 to complex space formula_2.

In our example, the vector space of sampled signals formula_2 is &quot;n&quot;-dimensional complex space. Any proposed inverse &quot;R&quot; of &quot;F&quot; (&quot;reconstruction formula&quot;, in the lingo) would have to map formula_2 to some subset of formula_1. We could choose this subset arbitrarily, but if we&#x27;re going to want a reconstruction formula &quot;R&quot; that is also a linear map, then we have to choose an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional linear subspace of formula_1.

This fact that the dimensions have to agree is related to the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem.

The elementary linear algebra approach works here. Let formula_7 (all entries zero, except for the &quot;k&quot;th entry, which is a one) or some other basis of formula_2. To define an inverse for &quot;F&quot;, simply choose, for each &quot;k&quot;, an formula_9 so that formula_10. This uniquely defines the (pseudo-)inverse of &quot;F&quot;.

Of course, one can choose some reconstruction formula first, then either compute some sampling algorithm from the reconstruction formula, or analyze the behavior of a given sampling algorithm with respect to the given formula.

Ideally, the reconstruction formula is derived by minimizing the expected error variance. This requires that either the signal statistics is known or a prior probability for the signal can be specified. Information field theory is then an appropriate mathematical formalism to derive an optimal reconstruction formula.

== Popular reconstruction formulae ==
Perhaps the most widely used reconstruction formula is as follows. Let formula_11 be a basis of formula_1 in the Hilbert space sense; for instance, one could use the eikonal

:formula_13,

although other choices are certainly possible. Note that here the index &quot;k&quot; can be any integer, even negative.

Then we can define a linear map &quot;R&quot; by

:formula_14

for each formula_15, where formula_16 is the basis of formula_2 given by

:formula_18

(This is the usual discrete Fourier basis.)

The choice of range formula_15 is somewhat arbitrary, although it satisfies the dimensionality requirement and reflects the usual notion that the most important information is contained in the low frequencies. In some cases, this is incorrect, so a different reconstruction formula needs to be chosen.

A similar approach can be obtained by using wavelets instead of Hilbert bases. For many applications, the best approach is still not clear today.

<text>Vladimir Yakovlevich Begun (; 1929–1989) was a prominent official Zionologist in the Soviet Union. He was a senior writer and researcher at the Institute for Philosophy and Law of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, a state communist propagandist, and a member of the Union of Journalists of the USSR.

Begun&#x27;s works focused on themes such as the Jewish conspiracy against communist countries. He characterized Zionism as the worst enemy of communism and an extended arm of Western imperialism. Together with other propagandists, he blamed Judaism and Torah as the roots of the Zionist danger. He maintained that it legitimized a &quot;chosen people&quot; ideology of racial superiority.

One of his controversial books, &quot;&quot;The Encroaching Counter Revolution&quot;,&quot; caused some controversy. In November 1975, the leading Soviet historian, academician M. Korostovtsev, criticized it, stating, &quot;...it perceptibly stirs up anti-Semitism under the flag of anti-Zionism.&quot; According to Wolf Rubinchyk, a researcher based in Minsk, Begun&#x27;s notorious book &quot;The Invasion without Arms&quot; was used not only by official propagandists but also by some members of the counter-elite, young Belarusian nationalists, who were suspicious about Zionism. Rubinchyk also pointed out falsifications of Simon Dubnow&#x27;s ideas by Begun. 

Begun gained a certain position in the Soviet hierarchy and was transferred from provincial Minsk to Moscow. Until his death, he staunchly opposed bringing Marc Chagall&#x27;s exhibition to Belarus, the famous artist&#x27;s place of birth, on &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; grounds.

<doc id="549558" wikidata="Q786522" url="?curid=549558" title="The Dragon Reborn">
<text>The Dragon Reborn is a fantasy novel by American writer Robert Jordan, the third in his series &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;. It was published by Tor Books and released on September 15, 1991. The unabridged audio book is read by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot; consists of a prologue and 56 chapters.

==Plot summary==

===From the Mountains of Mist to Tear===
Rand al&#x27;Thor, having been declared the Dragon Reborn by Moiraine Damodred, secretly goes to Tear to prove himself. Along the way he is hunted by Darkhounds and Darkfriends. Moiraine, Lan Mandragoran, the Ogier Loial, and Perrin Aybara follow him one step behind. Rand leaves a pattern of weddings and strange events in his trail. Perrin comes across an Aiel warrior that was captured and caged. He frees him, earning a friendship with Gaul, a Stone Dog, who will accompany Perrin on his travels. This event is witnessed by a hunter of the horn, Zarine Bashere (alias Faile), who joins the party as well.

Min reports to the Amyrlin Seat while Moiraine, Lan, Loial, Zarine and Perrin follow Rand. En route they battle Darkhounds and discover that the Forsaken Sammael rules in Illian.

===From Tar Valon to Tear===
Mat Cauthon is taken to Tar Valon by Verin Mathwin, Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara, Egwene al&#x27;Vere, Elayne Trakand and Hurin. Immediately after arrival in Tar Valon, Hurin departs to report to King Easar in Shienar. The Amyrlin Seat, Siuan Sanche, sets Nynaeve, Egwene, and later Elayne to hunting down the Black Ajah, and thus to Tear.

In the White Tower, through the use of a &quot;sa&#x27;angreal&quot; by Aes Sedai, Mat is healed of the corruptive influence of the ruby dagger from Shadar Logoth. Once healed, Mat defeats Galad Damodred and Gawyn Trakand in a practice sword battle using a quarterstaff. This wins him enough money to gamble with and purchase passage away from Tar Valon at which point he is approached by Nynaeve, Egwene, and Elayne to deliver a letter to her mother Queen Morgase. Mat reunites with Thom Merrilin and they travel to Andor, where Mat delivers the letter and learns of a plot by Queen Morgase&#x27;s lover, Lord Gaebril, to murder Elayne. To prevent this, Mat pursues the killers to Tear.

===Climax in the Stone of Tear===
In Tear, Nynaeve, Egwene, and Elayne are betrayed by Juilin Sandar (under the influence of Liandrin) to the Black Ajah and imprisoned in the Stone of Tear, eventually rescued by Mat and a repentant Juilin. Faile falls into a trap meant for Moiraine and Perrin risks his life to rescue her. Rand and the Forsaken Be&#x27;lal duel in the Stone of Tear until Moiraine kills Be&#x27;lal with balefire. Ba&#x27;alzamon disables Moiraine and attacks Rand, whereupon Rand takes &quot;Callandor&quot; (a more powerful &quot;sa&#x27;angreal&quot;) and apparently kills Ba&#x27;alzamon; Moiraine argues that the Dark One, having no tangible body, is not represented by the dead man. Egwene, remembering a prophecy, instead deduces that the corpse is possibly Ishamael, Chief among the Forsaken. The Aiel in Tear conquer the Stone in loyalty to Rand.

==Notes==

Among &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; books, &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot; stood out in that it only had a handful of chapters told from Rand al&#x27;Thor&#x27;s point of view. Nearly all chapters are told from the perspectives of his friends and allies as they race to catch up to and help him. That said, his presence in the plot is ubiquitous; all major characters are either trying to help him or working against him.

<doc id="549577" wikidata="Q938606" url="?curid=549577" title="Francis Bitter">
<text>Francis Bitter (July 22, 1902 – July 26, 1967) was an American physicist.

Bitter invented the Bitter plate used in resistive magnets (also called Bitter electromagnets). He also developed the water cooling method inherent to the design of Bitter magnets. Prior to this development, there was no way to cool electromagnets, limiting their maximum flux density.

==Early life==
Francis Bitter was born in Weehawken, New Jersey. His father, Karl Bitter, was a prominent sculptor.

Bitter entered the University of Chicago in 1919, but chose to leave his studies there in 1922 to visit Europe. He later transferred to Columbia University and graduated in 1925. He continued his studies in Berlin from 1925 to 1926 and received a PhD at Columbia in 1928. At Columbia, Bitter began his lifelong fascination with magnets.

==Career==
Under a National Research Council fellowship, Bitter studied gases at Caltech with Robert Andrews Millikan, from 1928 to 1930. While at Caltech, he married the Sheffield-born Alice Coomaraswamy. She had been a moderately successful singer working under the stage name Ratan Devi.

In 1930, Bitter went to work for Westinghouse, where he worked on various theoretical and applied problems concerning ferromagnetism.

With a Guggenheim Fellowship, Bitter travelled to England in 1933 and worked at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. There, he worked with Peter Kapitza on pulsed magnetic fields.

The following year, Bitter returned to America and his work at Westinghouse. Later in 1934, he joined the faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and continued to consult for Westinghouse.

===At M.I.T.===
Bitter joined the Department of Mining and Metallurgy as an associate professor in 1934. (The department is now known as Materials Science and Engineering.)

While at MIT, he developed the Bitter electromagnet which was/is the most powerful electromagnet design. He established a magnet laboratory in 1938, where he built a solenoid magnet that produced a constant field of 100,000 gauss (10 teslas).

He also did work in the first characterization of the Zeeman effect with George Harrison.

During the Second World War, Bitter worked for the Naval Bureau of Ordnance. He often traveled to England to find ways to demagnetize British ships to protect them from a new type of German mine, which used a compass needle to trigger detonation. The mine, dropped from the air, would sink to the bottom of a river and remain there with its magnetic needle aligned to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at that location. When a ship passed over it, the mass of the ship caused the magnetic needle to move slightly. The movement was enough to detonate the mine. In his autobiography &quot;Magnets, the Education of a Physicist&quot;, he referred to this unique work as &quot;Degaussing the fleet&quot;. (It is possible that he worked with Francis Crick, who was researching the same problem.)

After the war, Bitter returned to MIT and joined the faculty of the physics department. He became a full professor in 1951, and from 1956 to 1960, he served as associate dean of MIT&#x27;s school of science. From 1962 to 1965, Bitter was the housemaster of Ashdown House, MIT&#x27;s graduate dormitory.

==Legacy==
The Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, formerly a national laboratory, in Cambridge is named in his honor.

<doc id="549584" wikidata="Q263261" url="?curid=549584" title="Vassula Rydén">
<text>Vassula Rydén (January 18, 1942 – September 25, 2024) was an author, public speaker, and self-proclaimed Christian mystic living in Switzerland and on the Rhodes island, Greece, who said she received messages from Jesus Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary. Her writings frequently call for people &quot;to repent, love God, and unify the churches.&quot; She developed a large following, particularly among Roman Catholics, who came to her lectures purchasing her writings and tapes.
She wrote the messages in English, and changed some writings between editions.

In 1995, the Catholic Church&#x27;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, published a Notification (a message from the Holy See) on the writings of Rydén, saying her communications should not be considered supernatural, and calling all Catholic bishops to prevent Rydén&#x27;s ideas from being spread in their dioceses. In 2007, Cardinal William Levada confirmed that the 1995 Notification was still in effect; he recommended that Catholics should not join prayer groups organized by Rydén. In 2011, the Greek Orthodox Church officially disapproved of Rydén&#x27;s teachings, instructing their faithful to disassociate from Rydén. In 2012, the Church of Cyprus said that Rydén&#x27;s teachings were heretical.

== Personal life ==
Rydén was born Vassiliki Claudia Pendakis on January 18, 1942, in Heliopolis on the outskirts of Cairo, Egypt, the daughter of Greek Orthodox parents established in Egypt. Ryden says that from the age of six, she experienced waking dreams and nightmares that she attributed to Satan who was trying to kill her. When she was 10–12 years old, she had waking dreams of a spiritual marriage with Jesus Christ, as Blessed Virgin Mary was looking on.

Rydén started school in Egypt, and then at the age of 15, she emigrated with her family to Europe. She painted and competed in tennis. During her late teens, she said she was surrounded upon occasion by the spirits of dead people, who she said were asking her to help them. None of her childhood or teenage mystical experiences resulted in a personal religious transformation, and Rydén went on to live a fairly secular life indifferent to religion.

In November 1966, she married a Lutheran man in the city of Lausanne, Switzerland, at a Greek Orthodox Church. Her husband was a student who obtained a position with the United Nations after graduation. The couple had two sons together. Because of the husband&#x27;s job, the family lived in various places in Asia and Africa. From 1966 to 1980, Rydén kept up an active social life. She did not practice any particular religion. The couple was divorced in Sweden in November 1980.

On June 13, 1981, she married her second husband, Per Rydén, a Swedish Lutheran who had been working for the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) in Mozambique. He took a new position with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) department of the United Nations in Lesotho from 1981 to 1983, then worked again for SIDA from 1984 to 1987 in Bangladesh. Rydén modeled as a hobby, and painted in oils. She also competed in tennis, once winning the women&#x27;s doubles in a national tournament in Bangladesh. On October 31, 1990, the Rydéns celebrated their existing union in the Greek Orthodox Church in Lausanne. Per Rydén died July 15, 2021.

== Writings ==

In November 1985 when Rydén was living in Bangladesh, she said she experienced an extraordinary sensation when writing a grocery list, a list of cocktail party expenses, or a list of errands. Rydén says she suddenly experienced a light electrical feeling in her right hand and, at the same time, an invisible presence. She was unable to open her hand or lift her arm. She said &quot;an invisible force pushed my hand. I was not afraid, I do not know why.&quot; She says she permitted her hand to be guided and that she wrote a line in a very different style from her own with the words: &quot;I am your guardian Angel and my name is Daniel.&quot; Rydén says that this guardian Angel prepared her for three months to become a conduit of spiritual messages. After a few weeks of such training, Rydén says she had a vision and message from Jesus Christ.

Rydén also received messages from what she says is the Devil. An evil presence had moved her hand to write, sometimes making her write sensible words. She said that Jesus taught her to discern which spirits were engaging her in the writing of messages, and that the Devil&#x27;s hand thus became recognizable to her.

After six months of receiving messages, Rydén said she was directed by her guardian angel to find a local American priest named James &quot;Jim&quot; Fannan and tell him about her experiences. First, though, she encountered a German priest named Karl who said she was mentally imbalanced and should consult a doctor. After several more visits from Rydén, Karl summoned Fannan and the two priests watched Rydén at times when she says she received messages. Fannan&#x27;s initial response was that the messages were not from God but were some evil spirit. Fannan instructed Rydén to refuse the messages. Distraught, Rydén went home and asked her guardian angel for guidance about Fannan; she says that God told her &quot;I will bend him.&quot; In early 1987, Fannan told Rydén to speak with the priest Raymond Dujarrier. Preparing to travel to Dujarrier, Rydén says she received an evil message: &quot;A liar was guiding you, collect everything and burn it.&quot; Seconds later, Rydén says she felt the presence of God who guided her hand to write: &quot;I will be with you till the end, we are united forever; let My Light shine on you child; I am Yahweh guiding you; glorify Me by loving Me...&quot; Dujarrier assessed the messages as &quot;Divine Revelations of the Heart&quot;, and he told Rydén they were given to her to benefit others. After Dujarrier&#x27;s positive evaluation, Fannan changed his mind and became Rydén&#x27;s first ardent supporter in the Catholic church. He served as her spiritual adviser, occasionally traveling with her to introduce her to new groups.

In August 1987, Rydén&#x27;s husband began working for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the Rydén family moved to Switzerland. Rydén showed her messages to various Roman Catholic and Orthodox priests in Switzerland but met with little support. At Fannan&#x27;s urging, in June 1988 Rydén visited the city of Medjugorje in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to learn more about Our Lady of Medjugorje—the alleged apparition of the Virgin Mary, which six children there claimed to have received. In November 1988, Rydén was directed by her guardian angel to publish a book of the collected messages, and to conduct prayer meetings once a month. Theologian and sociologist Patrick de Laubier became interested in Rydén&#x27;s messages, and introduced her to French Mariologist Father René Laurentin in August 1989. Laurentin and Fannan were both in the Marian Movement of Priests, a group of priests who studied modern apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

Rydén is best known for a collection of nearly 2,000 of these messages published worldwide in many languages as &quot;True Life in God&quot;. She adhered to the idea that she had been called to transmit to the world the messages she received. However, Rydén never published the first ten months&#x27; worth of received messages. In 1993, Laurentin said that Rydén planned to publish the first messages. In 1995, Dominican theologian Father François-Marie Dermine, a Canadian-born priest serving as exorcist for the diocese of Bologna, Italy, wrote that Rydén said that she burned the early messages because there were too many, and they were loose scraps, not bound in a notebook. Dermine says that this destruction of the first messages is suspicious, as there would normally be heightened reverence held for them, if they were messages from angels and Jesus. Rydén wrote in 1995 that she destroyed or discarded the first messages.

Rydén says that prior to writing the messages, she had never studied catechism or theological formation. Rydén believed that God chose her, a &quot;spiritual zero&quot; before the revelations began, so as to leave no doubt that it was His power at work. She stated that: &quot;Jesus wanted a nothing... in order to prove that I have not invented all this and that it comes from Him. He said it in a message: &#x27;All you have comes from Me and is My Work and not yours. Without Me, you are unable to even wink your eyes-so abandon yourself to Me.&#x27;&quot;

Rydén&#x27;s first &quot;handwritten&quot; edition of &quot;True Life in God&quot; were produced in 1990 by Catholic publisher &quot;Editions O.E.I.L.&quot; of Paris, with a foreword written by Fannan. In 1991, the organization called Trinitas was formed to typeset Rydén&#x27;s writings and publish them in many languages. In September 1991, Mariologist Father Philip Pavich was given a copy of Rydén&#x27;s original messages complete with deletions and modifications showing how Rydén and an editorial assistant had modified the messages for publication. Pavich circulated a critical comparison showing the changes made from the original notebooks to the handwritten edition of &quot;True Life in God&quot;. Associates of Rydén questioned her; she responded by saying that the deleted text was &quot;taken out with God&#x27;s guidance.&quot; She explained that she keeps two notebooks: a private one filled with original messages, and a public one containing material rewritten from the private notebook. Dermine wrote in 2008 that the deleted material includes failed prophecies, and disappointments in Rydén&#x27;s life, such as the Virgin Mary telling Rydén in June 1988 that she would arrange a meeting between Rydén and Marian Movement of Priests founder Stefano Gobbi—a meeting that never happened.

Rydén asked American Jesuit Father Mitchell Pacwa to review her messages, so he studied the first five volumes of handwritten messages. Pacwa sent his critique to Father Michael O&#x27;Carroll, one of Rydén&#x27;s spiritual advisors, who said that Pacwa ought to refrain from publishing his findings, and implied divine retribution otherwise. Pacwa had determined that Rydén&#x27;s own confused interpretation of the Trinity was echoed in the messages she received, showing that it was Rydén making the messages. Pacwa published his criticism in August 1993, arguing that Rydén and her messages both confused the roles of God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. Rydén had written in her own hand the explanatory note, &quot;Jesus in this whole passage mentions the Father Himself as the Son and the Holy Spirit showing the action and the presence of the Holy Trinity,&quot; which Pacwa said demonstrated a &quot;muddled, if not heretical&quot; understanding of the Trinity. Pacwa listed many similar instances in the received messages of the Son and the Father being intermixed and confused in a manner not in keeping with Roman Catholic or Orthodox Catholic teaching. Years later, Dermine described the reaction of O&#x27;Carroll as typical of the Rydén organization&#x27;s response to criticism—a demonization of any who oppose Rydén.

Rydén&#x27;s messages are believed by her followers to have been prophetic. The Holy See instructs Catholics that the messages should be considered Rydén&#x27;s personal meditations, and not divine revelations.

=== Handwriting ===

Rydén supporters claim that graphological analysis of the handwriting that Rydén said she produced as dictation shows elements of resisting or being forced and that this is evidence of external spiritual control. In &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine in 2011, longtime investigator Joe Nickell compared Rydén&#x27;s &quot;messages&quot; to alleged communications from Jesus to other women claiming revelations and wrote, &quot;the contrived handwriting, the linguistic lapses, and the indications of fantasizing all suggest that Vassula Ryden is not in touch with supernatural entities but is simply engaging in self-deception that in turn deceives the credulous. Her automatic writings therefore are not works of revelation but simply of pious imagination.&quot; Nickell says that Rydén&#x27;s personal misspellings and linguistic errors are identical to those claimed to be written as Jesus, God, Mary, her own invisible &quot;guardian angel, Daniel,&quot; and Satan, and all seem to have the same hand writing and grammar. Nickell suggests, &quot;If God deigns to use the English language, should we not expect it to be rendered accurately?&quot; According to Nickell, &quot;One suspects that if Ryden were prevented from seeing what was being written, the entities supposedly guiding her hand would be unable to so faithfully follow the lines! I invite Ryden to accept my invitation to perform a scientific test to refute or confirm this suspicion.&quot;

== Other publications ==
Rydén continued to produce new volumes of messages in the series &quot;True Life in God&quot;; in 2003 she published the 12th volume, containing messages from notebooks 102 to 107. In 1995, she published &quot;My Angel Daniel&quot;, an account of the early messages. In March 2013, Rydén published &quot;Heaven Is Real, But So Is Hell&quot;.

== Reception ==

=== Positive ===
Following Father James Fannan, Fathers Rene Laurentin, Robert Faricy, and Michael O&#x27;Carroll as well as Archbishop Frane Franić, who are major promoters of Our Lady of Medjugorje, also actively support Rydén through their public statements and publications. Upon examination of the many objections made against Rydén, Laurentin stated that: &quot;she has excited more opposition than any other.&quot;

Supporters Fr. Edward O&#x27;Connor and Niels Hvidt believe that God is using Rydén&#x27;s messages to &quot;consolidate his church&quot; and bring it into unity, which they feel is the main theme of her books.

Other believers such as Fr. Ferdinand Umana Montoya say that Rydén&#x27;s writings are of supernatural origin of a type that he calls &quot;hieratic&quot; or &quot;sacred&quot; writing.

From 2002 to 2004 a dialogue took place at the request of Cardinal Ratzinger, then prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. It led to a written exchange of critical questions to which Vassula Rydén answered in writing and then a careful statement to Catholic bishops that Vassula Rydén had provided &quot;useful clarifications regarding her marital situation, as well as some difficulties which in the aforesaid Notification were suggested towards her writings and her participation in the sacraments&quot; (http://www.vassula-cdf.org/clarificationsNU/NUindex.html#13).

Subsequently, on November 28, 2005, Bishop Felix Toppo, S.J., D.D., granted the Nihil Obstat and on November 28, 2005, Archbishop Ramon C. Arguelles, STL, DD, granted the Imprimatur to the TLIG books which indicate that a given book contains nothing that is contrary to Catholic doctrine.

=== Negative ===

==== In the Catholic Church ====
In 1995, Dermine wrote a book, &quot;Vassula Rydén: indagine critica&quot; (Vassula Rydén: critical inquiry), analyzing Rydén&#x27;s first six books. Dermine described Rydén&#x27;s early works as promoting a New Age-type spirituality including millennialism and pan-Christian ecumenicism, preceded by a time in which the antichrist dominated the Church. He said these ideas were heretical to Roman Catholicism, and that Rydén stopped putting them in her writings after warnings from the Church, a factor which demonstrates that they are her own thoughts, not those of spirits. He showed how Rydén&#x27;s automatic writings were said by her to be from a variety of sources: guardian angels, Jesus, the Virgin Mary, God, and several Christian saints. Dermine noted that Rydén found some of her own messages to be false; she cancelled these ones. He wrote that Rydén explained away the problem by saying that God told her she could change any messages that she felt did not work. Dermine said that the whole body of Rydén&#x27;s writings could be dismissed on the basis of this supposed revelation. More damning than that was Dermine&#x27;s assessment that Rydén&#x27;s automatic writing was directed not by Jesus or God but by the Devil. Dermine wrote that automatic writing has never been part of Christian mysticism and divine revelation, but it has been connected with demonic possession.
Some skeptics have noted how the revelations have changed with time and have alleged that this was in order to conform more with church doctrine. Dermine compares Rydén&#x27;s early publications with later versions, noting that the changes made to the messages are one of the main reasons that the messages should be discredited.

In 1995, the Catholic Church&#x27;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) issued a Notification on the writings of Rydén, the Notification was also printed in &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, the official Vatican newspaper. The CDF stated that the &quot;attentive examination of the entire question&quot; had brought up &quot;a number of basic elements that must be considered negative in the light of Catholic doctrine&quot; as well as &quot;several doctrinal errors&quot;. It also questioned the &quot;suspect nature of the ways in which these alleged revelations have occurred&quot; and considers the fact that &quot;the aforementioned errors no longer appear in Ryden&#x27;s later writings is a sign that the alleged heavenly messages are merely the result of private meditations&quot;. The Notification concludes by requesting &quot;the intervention of the Bishops&quot; to prevent the dissemination of Ryden&#x27;s ideas in their dioceses and &quot;invites all the faithful not to regard Mrs Vassula Ryden&#x27;s writings and speeches as supernatural&quot;.

In 1996, Belgian theologian Joseph Moerman criticized an attack made by Laurentin on those who had been speaking out against Rydén. Moerman said that Laurentin&#x27;s defense of Rydén included unwarranted caricaturization of CDF leaders, and unsupported positive analysis of her writings. Moerman said that Rydén&#x27;s writings could not be directly from Jesus because of inconsistencies within them, and because of differences between the style of known mystics writing in a state of religious ecstasy and Rydén&#x27;s writings performed in &quot;normal lucidity&quot;.

In November 1996, the CDF issued a press release, stating that the Notification &quot;retains all its force&quot; and &quot;was approved by the competent authorities and will be published in the &quot;Acta Apostolicae Sedis&quot;, the official organ of the Holy See&quot;. It instructed Catholics &quot;not to regard the messages of Vassula Ryden as divine revelations, but only as her personal meditations&quot;.

In 1999, the Argentine organization &quot;Servicio Para el Esclarecimiento en Sectas&quot; (Foundation S.P.E.S.), formed to investigate new religious movements and sects, published a two-part bulletin critical of Rydén and her followers, authored by Mónica de López Roda. De López Roda described how Rydén&#x27;s mission appeared to be the unification of all Christian churches under a non-hierarchical ecumenicism; a spiritual Christianity devoid of doctrinal differences. She said that the positive words from Rydén provoked division among Christians because of questions about whether the messages were fake. De López Roda named supporters such as Archbishop Emmanuel Milingo and Father René Laurentin who reportedly questioned the directives of the 1995 Notification by the Holy See.

In September 2005, the spokesman for the Catholic Church in Scotland warned people against going to Rydén&#x27;s conference in Edinburgh. Referring to the 1995 Notification, he said Rydén &quot;certainly did not&quot; operate with the approval of the Church and that &quot;the advice to Catholics is not to attend her gatherings due to the suspect nature of her alleged revelations, which contain doctrinal errors.&quot;

In January 2006, Roger Mahony, the Archbishop of Los Angeles, California, approved the withdrawal of an invitation to host to a conference at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels at which the main speaker was to be Rydén. Mgr. Kostelnik, pastor of the cathedral, explained in a press release that the organizers had assured him that Rydén&#x27;s writings had &quot;been cleared by the Vatican&quot;, but that he had discovered that those assurances were &quot;a serious misrepresentation of the current Vatican view of Mrs Ryden&#x27;s speeches and writings&quot; and that the 1995 and 1996 Vatican statements cautioning Catholics against following Rydén remained &quot;in full force&quot;.

Cardinal Prosper Grech said he communicated to Rydén in the name of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the faith in some period after 1997. He had thought the CDF was satisfied, but in a letter dated January 25, 2007, the new Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal William Levada, following continued requests for clarifications on the writings and activities of Rydén, wrote to the Catholic hierarchy around the world stating that &quot;the Notification of 1995 remains valid as a doctrinal judgment&quot; of the writings, which should be seen as her own personal meditations and that Catholics should not take part in prayer groups established by Rydén.
Cardinal Grech reviewed &quot;Heaven is Real But So is Hell: An Eyewitness Account of What is to Come&quot; in 2014 and said it was an autobiography and apologia in the apocalyptic genre. Grech said that he does not know the origin of Rydén&#x27;s visions but that if they bring more people to God then &quot;there is no reason to reject them outright.&quot;

==== In the Orthodox Church ====
On March 16, 2011, the Greek Orthodox Church and synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople issued a disapproval of her teachings and instructed all Orthodox Christians not to associate with her. The Ecumenical Patriarchate &quot;denounce[d] from the Mother Church&quot; Rydén and her organization, &quot;True Life In God&quot;, and refused &quot;ecclesiastical communion&quot; to those involved. The Synodical Committee for Matters of Heresy of the Church of Cyprus announced on January 13, 2012, that Rydén&#x27;s &quot;teachings are heretical, and her claims that she communicates directly with Christ are fantastical and outside of the spirit of the experience of our Church.&quot;

== Lawsuit against critical website ==

In 2002, Maria Laura Pio, a former follower of Rydén&#x27;s teachings, published a website critical of Rydén. The website hosted a collection of documents and interviews that were critical of Rydén&#x27;s teachings. Niels Christian Hvidt cited the website in his book &quot;Christian Prophecy: The Post-Biblical Tradition&quot;. In May 2012 the website was closed because of the threat of legal action from Rydén&#x27;s attorneys, who argued that the term &quot;Vassula&quot; was trademarked, that a website named &quot;infovassula&quot; must belong to Rydén. Pio announced on 3 May 2012, &quot;I am going to close the website at the end of May and unfortunately, since I do not have the means financially nor mentally to face another lawsuit, no matter how ridiculous it is, I am constrained to hand over the domain name to Vassula in June 2012.&quot; In 2013, the Catholic research group obtained permission from Pio to remount the critical website under a new domain: www.pseudomystica.info.

== Activities ==
In 1998, Rydén&#x27;s True Life In God Foundation initiated the Beth Myriam (Mary&#x27;s House) project to feed the poor.

Rydén has made speaking appearances in a Buddhist Temple in Hiroshima, Japan in 1999, in Benin, Africa in 2000, and at a Christian Unity conference &quot;United in Christ&quot; at Namur, Belgium in 2009.

<text>A Bitter electromagnet or Bitter solenoid is a type of electromagnet invented in 1933 by American physicist Francis Bitter used in scientific research to create extremely strong magnetic fields. Bitter electromagnets have been used to achieve the strongest continuous manmade magnetic fields on earth―up to 45 teslas, .

== History ==

The design was invented in 1933 by American physicist, Francis Bitter, and named in his honor.

== Characteristics ==

Bitter electromagnets are used where extremely strong fields are required. The iron cores used in conventional electromagnets saturate, and are limited to fields of about 2 teslas. Superconducting electromagnets can produce stronger magnetic fields but are limited to fields of 10 to 20 teslas, due to flux creep, though theoretical limits are higher. For stronger fields resistive solenoid electromagnets of the Bitter design are used. Their disadvantage is that they require very high drive currents, and dissipate large quantities of heat.

== Construction ==
Bitter magnets are constructed of circular conducting metal plates (known as &quot;Bitter plates&quot;) and insulating spacers stacked in a helical configuration, rather than coils of wire. The current flows in a helical path through the plates. The purpose of the stacked plate design is to withstand the enormous outward mechanical pressure produced by Lorentz forces due to the magnetic field acting on the moving electric charges in the plate, which increase with the square of the magnetic field strength. Additionally, water circulates through holes in the plates as a coolant, to carry away the enormous heat created in the plates due to resistive heating by the large currents flowing through them. The heat dissipation also increases with the square of the magnetic field strength.

In the mid-1990s researchers at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) at Florida State University in Tallahassee improved on this basic design and created what they refer to as the &quot;Florida Bitter&quot;. By elongating the mounting and cooling holes, there is a substantial drop in the stresses developed in the system and an improvement in cooling efficiency. As the stresses increased in the original bitter plates, they would flex slightly causing the small circular cooling holes to move out of alignment reducing the efficacy of the cooling system. The Florida Bitter plates will flex less due to the reduced stresses, and the elongated cooling holes will always be in partial alignment despite any flexure the discs experience. This new design allowed for a 40% increase in efficiency and has become the design of choice for Bitter plate based resistive magnets.

== Current density and magnetic flux density ==

Unlike a copper wire, the current density of a current carrying disc is not uniform across its cross-sectional area, but is instead a function of the ratio of the inner diameter of the disc to an arbitrary radius within the disc. The implications of this relationship is that the current density decreases with an increase in radius. As such, the bulk of the current is flowing closer to the inner radius of the disc. Large discs (i.e., disc with a large difference between their inner and outer radius) will have a larger discrepancy in the current density between the inner and outer portions of the disc. This will reduce the efficiency and cause additional complications in the system because there will be a more substantial temperature and stress gradient along the disc. As such, a series of nested coils is often used as it will more evenly distribute the current across a large combined area as opposed to a single coil with large discs.

The non-uniform current density must also be considered when calculating the magnetic flux density. Ampère&#x27;s Law for a basic current carrying loop of wire gives that the on-axis magnetic flux is proportional to the current running through the wire and is related to the basic geometry of the loop, but is not concerned with the geometry of the cross section of the wire. The current density is uniform across the cross-sectional area of a wire. This is not the case for a Bitter disc. As such, the current term must be replaced with terms discussing the cross-sectional area of the disc and the current density. The equation for the on-axis magnetic flux density of a Bitter disc becomes much more complex as a result.

The differential flux density is related to the current density and the differential area. The introduction of a &quot;space factor&quot; must be included to compensate for variations in the disc related to cooling and mounting holes.

== Records ==
The strongest continuous magnetic fields on Earth have been produced by Bitter magnets. The strongest continuous field achieved solely with a resistive magnet is 41.5 tesla , produced by a Bitter electromagnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. 

 the strongest continuous field achieved by a room temperature magnet is 37.5T produced by a Bitter electromagnet at the Radboud University High Field Magnet Laboratory in Nijmegen, Netherlands.

The strongest continuous manmade magnetic field, 45T, was produced by a hybrid device, consisting of a Bitter magnet inside a superconducting magnet. The resistive magnet produces 33.5T and the superconducting coil produces the remaining 11.5T. The former magnet requires 30MW of power, the latter must be kept at using liquid helium, taking 6 weeks to cool. It costs $1452 per hour to run at full field. In 2019, another partially-superconducting electromagnet achieved the world record for a static DC magnetic field: 45.5T.

<text>Nimrod Racing Automobiles (sometimes referred to as Aston Martin Nimrod) was a partnership founded in 1981 between racing driver and car dealer Robin Hamilton and chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda, Victor Gauntlett. The project was intended to build sports prototypes for the World Endurance Championship and IMSA GT Championship using Aston Martin V8 engines. Although Aston Martin did not own the project, they offered their support for the chance to see success for their name in motorsports without the heavy cost of running their own team.

==NRA/C2==
Nimrod built three NRA/C2s for competition in 1982, with two being run by the works team while the third was sold to Dawnay Racing, a team owned by the then AMOC president Viscount Downe. The cars were capable of running both in the World Endurance Championship&#x27;s Group C specification and IMSA GT&#x27;s GTP specification.

Combining a production-based V8 engine from the V8 and V8 Vantage models, the engine was refined by Aston Martin Tickford to handle the increased output. Eric Broadley designed the chassis while his employer Lola Cars International built the tubs. Ray Mallock would later evolve the NRA/C2&#x27;s design into a B-spec model for the 1983 season.

==Team history==
Debuting at the 1000 km of Silverstone, Nimrod entered one of their own cars alongside the Dawnay Racing privateer entry. Nimrod faced mechanical troubles and did not finish, although Viscount Downe had a sixth-place finish. Problems continued for Nimrod Racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans where their race was ended early with an accident. Nimrod&#x27;s only success for the season came at the 1000km Spa, where one of their two cars finished, taking eleventh place. The combined results of Nimrod and Viscount Downe earned Aston Martin third in the constructors championship that year.

For 1982, with the evolved NRA/C2, Nimrod Racing would turn to the IMSA GT Championship in North America due to EMKA Racing taking over Aston Martin&#x27;s factory-backed efforts in Europe with their own car. Nimrod suffered throughout the season, earning their only success as the 12 Hours of Sebring with a fifth-place finish, third in the GTP class. The team would struggle to finish races for the rest of the season before financial trouble eventually forced them to return to Europe.

Following their disappointing return to Europe, Nimrod Racing Automobiles closed due to continued financial troubles, ending the short life of the project. A new chassis had been under development at the time, known as NRA/C3, yet was never completed before the team was dissolved. Privateers continued to use Nimrod&#x27;s NRA/C2 until the 1984 24 Hours of Le Mans, where two cars ran by Dawnay racing were destroyed in a fiery crash at the Mulsanne straight.

The Debate Team at St. Mary&#x27;s is also particularly strong, and competes against Seisen International School, The American School in Japan, the International School of the Sacred Heart, and Yokota High School. The team has won the annual Kanto Plains Debate Tournament three years in a row, from 2010 to 2012. It also won in 2021, with all three All-Stars being from St. Mary&#x27;s. 

The Speech Team at SMIS is also a strong team, and they compete in the annual Speech Contest amongst other KPASSP schools. In the most recent tournament, held at Seisen in Fall 2012, the SMIS Speech Team won second place.

Each year, the Math Contest team, composed of students skilled at math, take part in the Math Field Day, a tournament for KPASSP students. St. Mary&#x27;s tends to do particularly well there too, with usually at least 1 member of the team in the Top 5 at every grade level.

<text>The Aston Martin Bulldog, styled by William Towns, is a British, one-off concept vehicle produced by Aston Martin in 1979. The code name for the project was DP K901. Initially, a production run of 15–25 cars was planned, but the project was deemed too costly and only one was built. It is currently owned by Phillip Sarofim.

== History ==
The Bulldog - named after a Scottish Aviation Bulldog aeroplane flown by Aston Martin&#x27;s then managing director, Alan Curtis, but nicknamed &quot;K9&quot;, after the robotic dog from the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV series - was designed to show off the capabilities of Aston Martin&#x27;s new engineering facility in Newport Pagnell, as well as to chase after the title of fastest production car in the world. The car was officially launched on 27 March 1980 at the Bell Hotel at Aston Clinton. Although the car was built in the UK, it is left-hand-drive. The Bulldog&#x27;s sharp wedge shape was designed by William Towns. The car has five centre-mounted, hidden headlamps and gull-wing doors. The interior is upholstered in leather with walnut trim and uses multiple LED buttons like the Lagonda. Aston Martin planned to build 15–25 Bulldogs, but in 1981 Victor Gauntlett became chairman of the company and decided the project would be too costly, so the Bulldog project was shelved. In 1984 Aston Martin sold the Bulldog to a middle eastern collector for £130,000. The owner added both rear view mirrors and cameras. The Bulldog later was sold to an American collector and spent some time in the United States; it was later in storage in different places. 

It was shown at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2009, and at Aston Martin&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration at Kensington Park Gardens in July 2013.

It was found in storage in the Far East, and offered for sale in the UK. It was now green, compared to original exterior colours of silver and light grey. The interior had also been changed from the original dark brown and black to light tan. In 2020 the car was purchased by an American owner Phillip Sarofim and a full restoration project managed by Victor Gauntlett&#x27;s son Richard was organised.

Under its new ownership, plans were unveiled in early 2021 for Classic Motor Cars Ltd in Bridgnorth to perform a nut and bolt restoration with the aim of reaching 200mph. In November 2021 the car&#x27;s rebuild had been completed and the car achieved a speed of 162mph (261 km/h) on its initial shakedown on the main runway at RNAS Yeovilton. 

On 6 June 2023 BBC Radio 4&#x27;s news reported that the car had reached its promised 200 mph speed at Campbeltown Airport in Scotland, reaching a speed of 205.4 mph (330.55 km/h).

On 18 August 2024, the Bulldog was entered into the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance where it won first place in the &quot;Wedge-shaped Concept Cars and Prototypes (Late)&quot; class.

== Performance ==

The Bulldog is powered by a 5.3 litre V8 engine with twin Garrett turbochargers that produces 600 bhp (447 kW; 608 PS). The engine was capable of 700 bhp (522 kW; 710 PS) on the test bed, and maximum torque. When it came out, Aston Martin claimed the car was capable of 237 mph (381 km/h), but the highest speed the car was recorded reaching at that time was 191 mph (307 km/h) during a test run at the Motor Industry Research Association track in late 1979. The wedge-shaped design gave the Bulldog a drag coefficient of 0.34.

<text>The Fires of Heaven is a fantasy novel by American writer Robert Jordan, the fifth book in his series &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;. It was published by Tor Books and released on October 15, 1993.

It is the first novel in the series to not involve an appearance by each of the three ta&#x27;veren from the Two Rivers, due to Perrin&#x27;s absence. &quot;The Fires of Heaven&quot; consists of a prologue and 56 chapters.

==Plot summary==
In Rhuidean, worried by news that Aiel from other clans join the cause of his enemy Couladin, Rand al’Thor confers with the Clan Chiefs who have recognised him as the Car’a’carn – Chief of Chiefs – on how to win over the four remaining Clans. Darkhounds attack and he kills them with balefire, a powerful weave that burns a person&#x27;s thread backwards through the Pattern, undoing their past actions for a short time prior to being consumed by balefire. Egwene al&#x27;Vere continues to chafe under the instruction of Aiel Wise Ones, eager to learn faster than they think is wise, and Moiraine Damodred grows increasingly desperate to find her way into Rand&#x27;s circle of trust.

In Tanchico, Nynaeve and Elayne set out for the White Tower—only to receive news that it has suffered a schism. Elaida, a Red sister and former advisor to Queen Morgase Trakand, has deposed and replaced the Former Amyrlin Seat and ally Siuan Sanche.

Unwilling to accept an outsider as their prophesied hero, the Shaido and their allies follow Couladin across the Dragonwall to conquer the “treekillers” and wetlanders. Rand leads the seven Aiel Clans who have recognised him in pursuit and is followed in turn by the four of the undecided Aiel Clans. Along the way they are ambushed by Darkfriends and Shadowspawn but arrive in time to save the city of Cairhien and defeat the Shaido, in part thanks to the memories of long dead generals the Eelfinn have placed in Matrim Cauthon&#x27;s mind. Couladin is killed in single combat by Mat, while Rand is attacked from afar by either Rahvin or Sammael during the course of the battle.

As Rand establishes his control of Cairhien, a nation torn apart by scheming and war, he learns that the Forsaken Rahvin has deposed Queen Morgase who is presumed dead. Furious at himself for not acting sooner, Rand prepares to travel to Andor personally and kill Rahvin in revenge, but is delayed by Moiraine. Lanfear attacks Rand who is unwilling to fight back. Rand is saved by the sacrifice of Moirane who foresaw Lanfear&#x27;s attack.

Siuan, Leane and Min make way to Salidar, where the Aes Sedai who have escaped the Tower after Elaida&#x27;s coup have made a temporary base. Siuan subtly convinces Sheriam and the other Aes Sedai there that they must support Rand. Gareth Bryne follows shortly after, in pursuit of Siuan, and the Aes Sedai have him agree to help build an army for them.

Meanwhile, Nynaeve and Elayne seek out the rebel Aes Sedai accompanied by Thom and Juilin, discovering the forkroot herb that incapacitates channelers. Stuck in cities that are occupied by the Whitecloaks and with Elaida&#x27;s agents trying to capture Elayne, they disguise themselves and join a travelling circus menagerie, performing acts through villages and towns. Despite Egwene warning Nynaeve through a dream about the dangers of the world of dreams, Nynaeve still visits Tel’aran’rhiod alone trying to work with Birgitte to track the Forsaken Moghedien. Eventually Moghedien traps Nynaeve and Birgitte in the world of dreams, and the pair narrowly escapes, at the cost of Birgitte being pushed into the waking world severely injured. Elayne bonds Birgitte as her warder to help save her life.

The girls make their way to Samara, which is rife with troubles. Masema - who has named himself the prophet and taken over the city with zealous followers of the Dragon Reborn - and the Whitecloaks who have entered the town are on the brink of war. Nynaeve meets Galad there again, who has joined the Whitecloaks. Both he and Masema promise to help them get a ship to escape the city. After much trouble, Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom and Juilin, now accompanied by a band of Shienaran soldiers, make way to Salidar.

Nynaeve confronts Moghedien in a dream again, but this time she is successful in ensnaring her with an a&#x27;dam. Finding out that Rand may be in danger, she drags the Forsaken along to help save him through the world of dreams.

Rand Skims to Caemlyn, where his forces enter a trap laid by Rahvin. Lightning bolts triggered by Rahvin kill Mat, Asmodean and Aviendha, which causes Rand to recklessly attack the Forsaken. His battle with Rahvin leads him into the world of dreams, where with the assistance of Nynaeve he destroys Rahvin with Balefire. Upon returning to the waking world, he discovers that his balefire undid Rahvin&#x27;s killings of Mat, Aviendha and Asmodean. Before waking, Nynaeve realises Moghedien is posing as a refugee in the rebel Aes Sedai camp and doses her with forkroot, allowing her to be captured in the real world.

<doc id="549609" wikidata="Q6972569" url="?curid=549609" title="National Farmers' Union of England and Wales">
<text>The National Farmers&#x27; Union (NFU) is an employer association representing farming and growing businesses within England and Wales.

The NFU originated as the Lincolnshire Farmers&#x27; Union (LFU) which was founded in 1904. Over the next four years, similar farmers&#x27; organisations were established in neighbouring counties. In 1908, these organisations formed the current National Farmers&#x27; Union. Colin Campbell was its first president.

The organisation has been led by Tom Bradshaw as president since 2024.

==History==

=== Background tensions ===
The late 19th century coincided with increased struggle between three main groups:
*farmworkers, those farming on land on which they had no control over;
*tenant farmers, those renting the land to farm; and 
*landowners, those owning the agricultural land.

The rise of the labour movement saw farmworkers organise agricultural trade unions such as the Lincolnshire Labour League and the Warwickshire Agricultural Labourers Union. These unions initially achieved modest victories and growth, but a series of unsuccessful attempts to use collective action resulted in the decline and dissolution of early farmworkers&#x27; unions.

In response to the victory of the Liberal Party in the 1906 UK general election, many farm owners took revenge against farmers suspected of radical views or of Liberal sympathies. On 20 July 1906, the Eastern Counties Agricultural Labourers &amp; Small Holders Union was formed in an attempt to combat these retributions, and further renew unionisation efforts among farmworkers.

Further angered in their opposition to potential land reform by the Liberal government, the Central Land Association (CLA) was formed to represent landlords&#x27; interests against their farmers, and against the Liberal government.

=== Formation and growth ===

In 1904, the Lincolnshire Farmers&#x27; Union (LFU) was founded to represent tenant farmers, in part against both increasingly unionised farmworkers, and against landlords.

On 10 December 1908, a meeting was held at the Smithfield Show to discuss the formation of a national organisation formed from the LFU. The meeting resulted in the formation of the National Farmers&#x27; Union. By 1913, it had 20,000 members—a majority being tenant-farmers—and excluded landowners but allowed owner-occupying farmers.

The NFU&#x27;s first president, Colin Campbell, worked to get new branches off the ground, encourage membership and establish the NFU&#x27;s credibility with government, at a time when farming was going through the longest and deepest depression in its history, as imports of cheap grain and frozen meat flooded in from abroad.

The NFU stood six candidates in the 1918 general election, none of whom were elected. In the 1922 general election, it stood three unsuccessful NFU candidates under its own name, and sponsored four successful Conservative Party candidates. It again sponsored Conservative candidates in 1923 and 1935 elections, but has not done so since.

Campbell was succeeded as NFU President in 1921 by Richard Robbins, an employers&#x27; representative on the Agricultural Wages Board.

On 3 December 1955, 12 Welsh members of the NFU left and formed the rival Farmers&#x27; Union of Wales. Verley Merchant, the NFU&#x27;s Welsh Secretary, responded to the formation by saying &quot;We will smash you in three months&quot;.

=== Recent history ===
In 1972, the NFU, alongside other farming employers&#x27; associations, set up the British Agriculture Bureau to represent their interests in the European Economic Community and later the European Union.

In 2000, with the National Farmers&#x27; Union of Scotland, the Ulster Farmers&#x27; Union, and other farming and food organisations, the NFU founded the Assured Food Standards company which administers the Red Tractor food quality mark.

In 2003 Ben Gill stood down as NFU president. Both deputy president Tim Bennett, and Derek Mead—a founding member of Farmers for Action (FFA) as well as a NFU Council member—stood as candidates. Tim Benntt successfully defeated Derek Mead. In late 2005, Derek Mead along with Farmers for Action chairman David Handley, established the pressure group Better NFU over what they saw as the failures of the NFU&#x27;s leadership. Better NFU also received support from Zac Goldsmith and Robin Page. Following, the pressure groups&#x27; formation David Handley announced he would challenge sitting NFU President Tim Bennett for the position. Handley said wished to see the NFU be more proactive and democratic, while his opponents feared he would turn the NFU into a larger version of the FFA. Deputy President Peter Kendall also announced his candidacy. Peter Kendall won ahead of both in the 2006 leadership contest. Handley would describe Kendall as more collaborative than prior NFU Presidents.

As a part of the UK quango reforms by the Cameron–Clegg government, in 2013 the government prepared to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board—the body which had been responsible for regulating farm workers&#x27; wages. As pressure grew to maintain the board, the NFU lobbied in support of abolishing it. The government and the NFU were successful and in 2013 the board was abolished. In the same year, the NFU campaigned against the imposition of any cap on subsidies that farmers could receive.

In 2016, the Ethical Consumer Research Association published a report &quot;Understanding the NFU - an English Agribusiness Lobby Group&quot;. The report described the NFU as promoting policies that benefit big agribusinesses at the expense of farm workers pay and conditions, the environment, and animal welfare.

During the Brexit referendum, the NFU Council voted overwhelmingly to endorse the Remain campaign, but did not actively campaign on the issue. In the lead-up to the referendum, the NFU commissioned a report by Wageningen University which found that two of three Brexit scenarios could increase farm-gate prices.

In 2018, the NFU Council elected Minette Batters, deputy president of the NFU since 2014, as the NFU&#x27;s president. She defeated the only other candidate, Guy Smith, who became her deputy. She stepped down as president in February 2024 and was succeeded by Tom Bradshaw without any challengers.

In the October 2024 budget, the Labour government announced reforms to inheritance tax which revoke the exemptions for agricultural estates. From April 2026, these estates will be taxed at 20% (half the standard rate) but the first £1million of the property value will continue to be exempt. The NFU opposed the reforms, and responded by organising a protest in London.

In 2025 NFU held an AgriFutures Diversity Conference at STEAM house in Birmingham to promote inclusivity in agriculture. 

The archives of the NFU are deposited with the Rural History Centre at Reading University.

==Structure and function==

The NFU is registered as an employer association with the Certification Office for Trade Unions and Employers&#x27; Associations. Despite potential confusion due to &quot;Union&quot; being in the NFU&#x27;s name, it is not a trade union.

The NFU is governed by its constitution and rules, which state that the NFU shall maintain a number of bodies which are responsible for the governance of the NFU. These include the NFU Council, Governance Board, Policy Board, National Commodity Boards, Regional Commodity Boards, an Audit and Remuneration Committee and Legal Board and Regional Boards.

The NFU is led by its president (currently Tom Bradshaw since 2024). The position is elected by the 92 member NFU Council, the NFU&#x27;s governing body.

The NFU is closely associated with the insurance company NFU Mutual.

Prior to its abolition in 2013, the National Farmers&#x27; Union nominated eight employers&#x27; representatives to the Agricultural Wages Board of England and Wales.

=== NFU Cymru ===

NFU Cymru is the constituent Welsh branch of the NFU. It was formed in 1999 in response to Welsh devolution and the formation of the Welsh Senedd. NFU Cymru&#x27;s current president is Aled Jones who has held the role since 2022.

NFU Cymru is based at the Royal Welsh Showground in Builth Wells.

NFU Cyrmu nominates one of the two employers&#x27; representatives on the seven-member Agricultural Advisory Panel for Wales.

=== British Agriculture Bureau ===
The British Agriculture Bureau (BAB) is the joint office of the NFU, the National Farmers&#x27; Union of Scotland and Ulster Farmers&#x27; Union in Brussels. The BAB lobbies for the British farming industry in regards to European Union policy.

<text>Miljenko Jergović (born 28 May 1966) is a prominent Bosnian writer.

==Biography==
Born in Sarajevo, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia to Croatian parents, Jergović received his M.A. in literature from the Sarajevo University. While at high-school, he started working as a journalist in printed and electronic media, as a contributor to literary and youth magazines, and was soon recognized as Croatia&#x27;s media correspondent from Sarajevo.

==Writing==

Jergović&#x27;s novels treat his family members and their histories. He is also a journalist and has published a collection of his articles in &quot;Historijska čitanka&quot; (&quot;A Reader in History,&quot; 1996).

Jergović writes a column in the Serbian daily &quot;Politika&quot;, for &quot;Vreme&quot; magazine and a regular column in the Croatian daily &quot;Jutarnji list&quot; entitled &quot;Sumnjivo lice&quot; (trans. &quot;suspicious character&quot;, lit. &quot;suspicious face&quot;).

==Works==
His novel &quot;Buick Riviera&quot; was made into a movie in 2008 by filmmaker Goran Rušinović, and the two were in turn awarded the Golden Arena for Best Screenplay. According to the author himself, it is a &quot;novella&quot; set in North American countryside, dealing with the conflict of a Serbian refugee from Bosnia, probably a war criminal, and a Muslim refugee who had spent twenty years in the United States. Its heroes, who always carry with them their native lore, their religion and their mentality, though they have numerous reasons for feelings of love and understanding of others, become victims of their own inability to rise above their national background, above their old hatreds and the burden of historical conflicts.

Miljenko Jergovic wrote another novel or &quot;documented diary&quot; – &quot;Volga, Volga&quot;, a book about a car and his driver. This is a complicated story about guilt and death, the Yugoslav war and internal conflicts. As Jergovic is a great storyteller, he starts with the outside: Volga is not only black but glossy black like a piano. The reader realizes a main effect of storytelling: that war destroys, while stories nurture and continue life. Focal characteristics of the book are desire and strangeness, sadness and anger. Jergović’s car is a &quot;documentary fantasy&quot; and the story is about a generation living a lie. Jergović’s Yugoslavia lost in dreams of acting, the desire for truth is opposed illusions and dreams, lies and legends. Jergovic the master of melancholy presents driving as a journey into the past, awakens memories of companions, times of sadness and loneliness. A central figure in the novel is Jalal Pljevljak, who is the experienced driver and a Muslim believer, whose faith prohibits the consumption of alcohol, drunk, and so risked disaster. Although the reader gets the key to a mysterious accident, the second impression prevails: the uncertainty about where the boundaries between fact, facts, legends, dreams and lies are. The truth about things, it shows the contrasting perspectives of game storytelling, not just a matter of personal integrity and identity. Thus, the author briefly illuminates the history of the former Yugoslavia. As the scene of religious, ethnic and political relations and conflict within the former multinational federation determines the flow and actions, so, for example, accused Pljevljak, both Croat and Muslim. At the end of the wars in the nineties it was very popular among intellectuals and yellow press to relativize the guilt of the pre-war crime and surrender it to forgetfulness. So, the case Pljevljak for a reader is a metaphor of the fate of the whole country.

==Literary circles==

A number of private conflicts in literary circles drew public attention to disagreement among famous writers. Namely, issues in the Croatian Writers&#x27; Society created fragmentation and an alleged unjust disqualification of writers on political grounds. Over the course of his career, Jergović was involved in these issues, as were many other noteworthy writers. In October 2002, Jergović was elected to the Croatian Writers&#x27; Society board of directors. In 2003, there was criticism that one of CWS founders, Velimir Visković, was judging CWS members on political grounds. This was revealed when Drago Štambuk pointed out Visković&#x27;s former association with the HDZ government. In April 2006, Jergović became involved in a literary dispute with Dražen Katunarić over Jergović&#x27;s text on Houellebecqu, which Jergović&#x27;s considered charlatan for being based on the Qur&#x27;an. Katunarić said that such texts with a Sarajevan and Islamic basis are not accepted in Zagreb. To which Jergović responded for him to put a gun to his head. This controversy encouraged Zdravko Zima to resign his membership in the Croatian Writers&#x27; Society because he felt the leadership wasn&#x27;t distancing themselves from the attacks on Katunarić. In April 2007, Jergović himself withdrew from CWS. Jergović said that the society contrasted his attitude to Croatian literature and literature in general. A number of other writers cut ties with the association in a similar fashion, including Ivan Lovrenović who resigned because he felt Velimir Visković&#x27;s disqualification called for the real and symbolic dismissal of Jergović in 2011.

In 2009, Visković made public claims about Jergović reaffirming Chetniks in Serbia and setting out to market books for a Serbian market. Visković made these claims in response to an interview Jergović gave. Some questioned whether the reason for the conflict with Jergović was Visković&#x27;s life project – the Encyclopedia of Croatian Literature. When CWS members asked Visković to apologize, he refused, citing years of insults to him, his family and other prominent writers.

==Personal life==
Born in Sarajevo in 1966, Jergović spent half of his life in his hometown. He also spent the first year of the Bosnian War, more precisely the Siege of Sarajevo there, before moving to Zagreb in 1993.

Jergović has been known as an avid supporter of Sarajevo football club FK Željezničar, whose fan he has been since he was a kid, having a membership card of the club as well, renewing it in July 2019.

==Awards==
In 2012, he received the Angelus Central European Literature Award for his book &quot;Srda pjeva, u sumrak, na Duhove&quot; (&quot;Srda Sings at Dusk On Pentecost&quot;) and in 2018 he won the Georg Dehio Book Prize. In 2024 he received the Vilenica Prize.

<text>A file is a tool used to remove fine amounts of material from a workpiece. It is common in woodworking, metalworking, and other similar trade and hobby tasks. Most are hand tools, made of a case hardened steel bar of rectangular, square, triangular, or round cross-section, with one or more surfaces cut with sharp, generally parallel teeth. A narrow, pointed tang is common at one end, to which a handle may be fitted.

A rasp is a form of file with distinct, individually cut teeth used for coarsely removing large amounts of material.

Files have also been developed with abrasive surfaces, such as natural or synthetic diamond grains or silicon carbide, allowing removal of material that would dull or resist steel files, such as ceramic.

== History ==
Early filing or rasping has prehistoric roots and grew naturally out of the blending of the twin inspirations of cutting with stone cutting tools (such as hand axes) and abrading using natural abrasives, such as well-suited types of stone (for example, sandstone). Relatedly, lapping is also quite ancient, with wood and beach sand offering a natural pair of lap and lapping compound. The Disston authors state, &quot;To abrade, or file, ancient man used sand, grit, coral, bone, fish skin, and gritty woods,—also stone of varying hardness in connection with sand and water.&quot;

The Bronze Age and the Iron Age had various kinds of files and rasps. Archaeologists have discovered rasps made from bronze in Egypt, dating back to the years 1200–1000 BC. Archaeologists have also discovered rasps made of iron used by the Assyrians, dating back to the 7th Century BC.

During the Middle Ages files were already quite advanced, thanks to the extensive talents of blacksmiths. By the 11th century, there already existed hardened files that would seem quite modern even to today&#x27;s eyes. But although they existed, and could even have spread widely, in a geographical sense, via trade, they were not widespread in the cultural sense of the word—that is, most people, and even many smiths, did not have them. For example, in the 13th century, ornamental iron work at Paris was done skillfully with the aid of files, but the process was a secret known only to a master craftsman. The Disston authors state, &quot;It was not until the fourteenth century, however, that those who practiced art in ironwork began to use other tools, besides heat and the hammer, regularly.&quot; This statement could mislead in the sense that stoning (with sandstone) and lapping (with wood, sand, and water) have never been rare activities among humans, or especially smiths. But the point is that modern iron or steel files, with teeth and hardening, and the material culture of intricate filing that would lead to locksmithing and gunsmithing, for example, are what took time to become common. But by the late Middle Ages, the transition was extensive. The Disston authors mention Nuremberg, Sheffield, and Remscheid (they use the &quot;Reimscheid&quot; spelling) as leading centers of production for files as well as tools in general. The activity in Remscheid reflects the metalworking spirit of the Rhine-Ruhr region in general (including Essen, Düsseldorf, and Cologne) rather than representing a single village of geniuses in isolation. (Considering the Disston authors&#x27; mention of the blacksmith guilds of 13th-century Florence and 15th-century England, coupled with their mention of Nuremberg, Sheffield, and Remscheid, the region that sweeps from Florence through Nuremberg, the Rhine-Ruhr, the Netherlands, and up to Sheffield, can be compared to the modern economics notation of the Blue Banana.) Most files of the period were smithed by hand in a sequence in which the iron was forged (heated and hammered), then the teeth were cut with a chisel (some of this action was just as much upsetting/swaging as it was cutting), and then the piece was hardened (by heating and then quenching), followed sometimes by tempering. Among the drawings of Leonardo da Vinci is a sketch of a machine tool for the cutting of files (the chisel would make one strike, swaging a tooth, then automatically advance into position for the next tooth, and strike again).

Prior to the industrialization of machining and the development of interchangeable parts during the 19th century, filing was much more important in the construction of mechanisms. Component parts were roughly shaped by forging, casting, and by primitive machining operations. These components were then individually hand-fitted for assembly by careful and deliberate filing. The potential precision of such fitting is much higher than generally assumed, but the components of such hand-fit assemblies are decidedly not interchangeable with those from another assembly. Locks, clocks, and firearms (flintlocks and earlier) were manufactured in this way for centuries before the Industrial Revolution.

Machining in the mid-19th century was heavily dependent on filing, because milling practice was slowly evolving out of its infancy. As late as the early 20th century, manufacturing often involved filing parts to precise shape and size. In today&#x27;s manufacturing environment, milling and grinding have generally replaced this type of work, and filing (when it occurs at all) usually tends to be for deburring only. Skillful filing to shape and size is still a part of diemaking, moldmaking, toolmaking, etc., but even in those fields, the goal is usually to avoid handwork when possible.

== Types ==
Files come in a wide variety of materials, sizes, shapes, cuts, and tooth configurations. The cross-section of a file can be flat, round, half-round, triangular, square, knife edge or of a more specialized shape. Steel files are made from high carbon steel
 (1.0 to 1.25% carbon) and may be through hardened or case hardened.

There is no unitary international standard for file nomenclature; however, there are many generally accepted names for certain kinds of files. A file is &quot;blunt&quot; if its sides and width are both parallel throughout its length. It is &quot;tapered&quot; if there is a reduction in its dimensions from its heel toward its point. A file may taper in width, in thickness, or both. A &quot;tang&quot; is a protrusion at the heel, tapered, parallel sided, or conical, for gripping, inserting in a handle, or mounting in a chuck.

The &quot;cut&quot; of the file refers to how fine its teeth are. They are defined as (from roughest to smoothest): rough, middle, bastard, second cut, smooth, and dead smooth. A &quot;single-cut&quot; file has one set of parallel teeth while a &quot;cross-cut&quot; or &quot;double-cut&quot; file has a second set of cuts forming diamond shaped cutting surfaces. In Swiss-pattern files the teeth are cut at a shallower angle, and are graded by number, with a number 1 file being coarser than a number 2, etc. Most files have teeth on all faces, but some specialty flat files have teeth on only one face or one edge, so that the user can come right up to another edge without damaging the finish on it.

Some of the common shapes and their uses:

* Barrette files are tapered in width and thickness, coming to a rounded point at the end. Only the flat side is cut, and the other sides are all safe. For doing flat work.
* Checkering files parallel in width and gently tapered in thickness. They have teeth cut in a precise grid pattern, and are used for making serrations and doing checkering work, as on gunstocks.
* Crochet files are tapered in width and gradually tapered in thickness, with two flats and radiused edges, cut all around. Used in filing junctions between flat and curved surface, and slots with rounded edges.
* Crossing files are half round on two sides with one side having a larger radius than the other. Tapered in width and thickness. For filing interior curved surfaces. The double radius makes possible filing at the junction of two curved surfaces or a straight and curved surface.
* Dreadnought (curved teeth) and millenicut (straight teeth) files both have heavily undercut, sharp but coarse teeth. Both can be used for rapidly removing large quantities of material from thick aluminum alloy, copper or brass. Today, the millenicut and dreadnought have found a new use in removing plastic filler materials such as two-part epoxies or styrenes such as those commonly used in automobile body repairs.
* Equalling files are parallel in width and thickness. Used for filing slots and corners.
* Farrier Rasp files are tanged rasps used mainly by farriers and blacksmiths. They are flat with a rasp on one side and double cut on the reverse.
* Fret files are square or rectangular with three flat sides and one side having a concave groove. They are used by luthiers to file a rounded &quot;crown&quot; on the frets of guitars and other fretted instruments. The flat faces are used to dress the ends of the frets, removing the sharp edges left after the frets are trimmed to length.
*Half round ring files taper in width and thickness, coming to a point, and are narrower than a standard half round. Used for filing inside of rings.
*Joint round edge files are parallel in width and thickness, with rounded edges. The flats are safe (no teeth) and cut on the rounded edges only. Used for making joints and hinges.
* Knife files are tapered in width and thickness, but the knife edge has the same thickness the whole length, with the knife edge having an arc to it. Used for slotting or wedging operations.
* Nut files are fine, precise files in sets of graduated thickness, used by luthiers for dressing the slots at the end of the neck which support the strings of guitars, violins etc., in the correct position.
* Pillar files are parallel in width and tapered in thickness for perfectly flat filing. Double cut top and bottom with both sides safe, these are long, narrow files for precision work.
* Pippin files are tapered in width and thickness, generally of a teardrop cross section and having the edge of a knife file. Used for filing the junction of two curved surfaces and making V-shaped slots.
*Planemaker&#x27;s float Floats are straight, single-cut files which taper used for cutting, flattening and smoothing wood, particularly in making wooden hand planes.
* Round parallel files are similar to round files, except that they do not taper. Shaped like a toothed cylinder.
* Saw sharpening files are usually single cut to deliver a smooth finish. They are suited to sharpening saw blades and dressing tool edges, especially where a finer, sharper edge or smoother surface finish is desired. The Chainsaw file is one example, used primarily for sharpening chainsaws. These appear to have a round cross-section, but are actually shaped to fit snugly against the cutting edge of a chainsaw&#x27;s teeth.
* Slitting files are parallel in width with a diamond-shaped cross section. Thinner than knife files and use for filing slots.
* Warding files are parallel in thickness, tapered in width, and thin. Like a hand or flat file that comes to a point on the end. Used for flat work and slotting.

=== Diamond files ===
Instead of having teeth cut into the file&#x27;s working surface, diamond files have small particles of industrial diamond embedded in their surface (or into a softer material that is bonded to the underlying surface of the file). The use of diamonds in this manner allows the file to be used effectively against extremely hard materials, such as stone, glass or very hard metals such as hardened steel or carbide against which a standard steel file is ineffective. Diamond files are also the only type that may be used with a back-and-forth motion without damaging the file. These may also be called diamond laps, as the &quot;teeth&quot; are not regular projections, as in a file, but particles, usually shaped and located randomly and held in place by a softer (any other) material.
=== Needle files ===
The image to the left shows a selection of needle files in an assortment of cross sectional shapes.

Needle files are small files that are used in applications where the surface finish takes priority over metal removal rates but they are most suited for smaller work pieces. They are often sold in sets, including different shapes.
=== Riffler files ===
Riffler files are small to medium-sized files in an assortment of cross sectional shapes and profiles. The varying profiles and shapes enable them to be used in hard to reach, or unusually shaped areas. They are often used as an intermediate step in die making where the surface finish of a cavity die may need to be improved, e.g. in plastic injection moulding or die casting.
=== Machine files ===
Files are produced specifically for use in a &quot;filing machine&quot;, which is similar in appearance to a scroll saw with a vertically reciprocating file mounted in the middle of a table. A workpiece is manipulated around the file&#x27;s face as the shape requires.

A cone point (as pictured in the top and bottom files at left) allows a file to center itself in its mount. Files with flat mounting surfaces must be secured with set screws.

Filing machines are rarely seen in modern production environments, but may be found in older toolrooms or diemaking shops as an aid in the manufacture of specialist tooling.
=== Escapement files ===

Escapement files, also known as watchmaker&#x27;s files, are a classification of short, (very) thin files with bastard-cut (medium coarseness) or embedded diamond surfaces, similar to needle files in form and function but smaller. Typical dimensions are on the order of approximately 100–140 mm (4–5 in.) in length and 3–5 mm (– in.) in width. Best used for fine, delicate work on small pieces or mechanisms (such as escapements), escapement files are commonly used by clock and watchmakers, as well as in crafting jewelry.

=== Dental files ===

During root canal therapy, round files ranging from diameter files are used to smooth the narrow canals of the interior of the tooth and thus facilitate disinfection of the internal surface. Typically the files are made of stainless steel or nickel titanium (NiTi) and come in a variety of styles. Mechanized files, known as rotary files, are also commonly used. These files attach to the head of a specific oscillating or rotating drill.

== Use ==
Files have forward-facing cutting teeth, and cut most effectively when pushed over the workpiece. A variety of strokes are employed to stabilize the cutting action and produce a varied result. &quot;Draw filing&quot; is an operation in which the file is grasped at each end, and with an even pressure alternately pulled and pushed perpendicularly over the work. A variation involves laying the file sideways on the work, and carefully pushing or pulling it across the work. This catches the teeth of the file sideways instead of head on, and an extremely fine shaving action is produced. There are also varying strokes that produce a combination of the straight ahead stroke and the drawfiling stroke, and very fine work can be attained in this fashion. Using a combination of strokes, and progressively finer files, a skilled operator can attain a surface that is perfectly flat and near flawless finish.

&quot;Pinning&quot; refers to the clogging of the file teeth with &quot;pins&quot;, which are material shavings. These pins cause the file to lose its cutting ability and can scratch the workpiece. A &quot;file card&quot;, which is a brush with metal bristles, is used to clean the file. (The name, &quot;card&quot;, is the same as used for the &quot;raising cards&quot; (spiked brushes) used in woolmaking.) Chalk can help prevent pinning.

<doc id="549614" wikidata="Q425185" url="?curid=549614" title="Glucokinase">
<text>Glucokinase () is an enzyme that facilitates phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. Glucokinase occurs in cells in the liver and pancreas of humans and most other vertebrates. In each of these organs it plays an important role in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism by acting as a glucose sensor, triggering shifts in metabolism or cell function in response to rising or falling levels of glucose, such as occur after a meal or when fasting. Mutations of the gene for this enzyme can cause unusual forms of diabetes or hypoglycemia.

Glucokinase (GK) is a hexokinase isozyme, related homologously to at least three other hexokinases. All of the hexokinases can mediate phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which is the first step of both glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. However, glucokinase is coded by a separate gene and its distinctive kinetic properties allow it to serve a different set of functions. Glucokinase has a lower affinity for glucose than the other hexokinases do, and its activity is localized to a few cell types, leaving the other three hexokinases as more important preparers of glucose for glycolysis and glycogen synthesis for most tissues and organs. Because of this reduced affinity, the activity of glucokinase, under usual physiological conditions, varies substantially according to the concentration of glucose.
==Nomenclature==
Alternative names for this enzyme are: human hexokinase IV, hexokinase D, and ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1 (previously 2.7.1.2). The common name, glucokinase, is derived from its relative specificity for glucose under physiologic conditions.

Some biochemists have argued that the name glucokinase should be abandoned as misleading, as this enzyme can phosphorylate other hexoses in the right conditions, and there are distantly related enzymes in bacteria with more absolute specificity for glucose that better deserve the name and the EC 2.7.1.2. Nevertheless, glucokinase remains the name preferred in the contexts of medicine and mammalian physiology.

Another mammalian glucose kinase, ADP-specific glucokinase, was discovered in 2004. The gene is distinct and similar to that of primitive organisms. It is dependent on ADP rather than ATP (suggesting the possibility of more effective function during hypoxia), and the metabolic role and importance remain to be elucidated.

==Catalysis==

=== Substrates and products===
The principal substrate of physiological importance of glucokinase is glucose, and the most important product is glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). The other necessary substrate, from which the phosphate is derived, is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) when the phosphate is removed. The reaction catalyzed by glucokinase is shown in the inset.

ATP participates in the reaction in a form complexed to magnesium (Mg) as a cofactor. Furthermore, under certain conditions, glucokinase, like other hexokinases, can induce phosphorylation of other hexoses (6 carbon sugars) and similar molecules. Therefore, the general glucokinase reaction is more accurately described as:
::Hexose + → hexose- + + 

Among the hexose substrates are mannose, fructose, and glucosamine, but the affinity of glucokinase for these requires concentrations not found in cells for significant activity. Nonetheless, the specificity for glucose is much less clear than was long thought, and by the usual criteria for specificity fructose is a good substrate.

===Kinetics===
Three important kinetic properties distinguish glucokinase from the other hexokinases, allowing it to function in a special role as glucose sensor.
# Glucokinase has a lower affinity for glucose than the other hexokinases. Glucokinase changes conformation and/or function in parallel with rising glucose concentrations in the physiologically important range of 4–10 M (72–180 mg/dL). It is half-saturated at a glucose concentration of about 8 mM (144 mg/dL).
# Glucokinase is not inhibited by physiological concentrations of its product, glucose-6-phosphate. This allows continued signal output (e.g., to trigger insulin release) amid significant amounts of its product
#Another distinctive property of glucokinase is its moderate cooperativity with glucose, with a Hill coefficient (&quot;h&quot;) of about 1.7.

These features allow it to regulate a &quot;supply-driven&quot; metabolic pathway. That is, the rate of reaction is driven by the supply of glucose, not by the demand for end products.

Because of the cooperativity, the kinetic interaction of glucokinase with glucose does not follow classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Rather than a &quot;K&quot;m for glucose, it is more accurate to describe a half-saturation level &quot;S&quot;0.5, the concentration at which the enzyme is 50% saturated and active.

The &quot;S&quot;0.5 and &quot;h&quot; result in an inflection of the curve enzyme activity as a function of glucose concentration at about 4 mM. In other words, at a glucose concentration of about 72 mg/dL, which is near the low end of the normal range, glucokinase activity is most sensitive to small changes in glucose concentration.

As glucokinase is a monomeric enzyme with only a single binding site for glucose the cooperativity cannot be explained in terms of classical models of equilibrium cooperativity, but requires a kinetic explanation, such as a slow-transition model or a &quot;memonical&quot; model that invokes enzyme memory.

The kinetic relationship with the other substrate, MgATP, can be described by classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an affinity at about 0.3–0.4 mM, well below a typical intracellular concentration of 2.5 mM. The fact that there is nearly always an excess of ATP available implies that ATP concentration rarely influences glucokinase activity.

The maximum specific activity (&quot;k&quot;cat) of glucokinase when saturated with both substrates is 62/s.

The pH optimum of human glucokinase was identified only recently and is surprisingly high, at pH 8.5–8.7.

A &quot;minimal mathematical model&quot; has been devised based on the above kinetic information to predict the beta cell glucose phosphorylation rate (BGPR) of normal (&quot;wild type&quot;) glucokinase and the known mutations. The BGPR for wild type glucokinase is about 28% at a glucose concentration of 5 mM, indicating that the enzyme is running at 28% of capacity at the usual threshold glucose for triggering insulin release.

===Mechanism===
The sulfhydryl groups of several cysteines surround the glucose binding site. All except cys 230 are essential for the catalytic process, forming multiple disulfide bridges during interaction with the substrates and regulators. At least in the beta cells, the ratio of active to inactive glucokinase molecules is at least partly determined by the balance of oxidation of sulfhydryl groups or reduction of disulfide bridges.

These sulfhydryl groups are quite sensitive to the oxidation status of the cells, making glucokinase one of the components most vulnerable to oxidative stress, especially in the beta cells.

===Interactive pathway map===
== Structure ==
Glucokinase is a monomeric protein of 465 amino acids and a molecular weight of about 50 kDa. There are at least two clefts, one for the active site, binding glucose and MgATP, and the other for a putative allosteric activator that has not yet been identified.

This is about half the size of the other mammalian hexokinases, which retain a degree of dimeric structure. Several sequences and the three-dimensional structure of the key active sites are highly conserved both in intra-species homologs and across species from mammals to yeast. The ATP binding domain, for example, are shared with hexokinases, bacterial glucokinases, and other proteins, and the common structure is termed an &quot;actin fold&quot;.

==Genetics==
Human glucokinase is coded for by the &quot;GCK&quot; gene on chromosome 7. This single autosomal gene has 10 exons.
 Genes for glucokinase in other animals are homologous to human &quot;GCK&quot;.

A distinctive feature of the gene is that it begins with two promoter regions. The first exon from the 5&#x27; end contains two tissue-specific promoter regions. Transcription can begin at either promoter (depending on the tissue) so that the same gene can produce a slightly different molecule in liver and in other tissues. The two isoforms of glucokinase differ only by 13–15 amino acids at the N-terminal end of the molecule, which produces only a minimal difference in structure. The two isoforms have the same kinetic and functional characteristics.

The first promoter from the 5&#x27; end, referred to as the &quot;upstream&quot; or neuroendocrine promoter, is active in pancreatic islet cells, neural tissue, and enterocytes (small intestine cells) to produce the &quot;neuroendocrine isoform&quot; of glucokinase. The second promoter, the &quot;downstream&quot; or liver promoter, is active in hepatocytes and directs production of the &quot;liver isoform.&quot; The two promoters have little or no sequence homology and are separated by a 30 kbp sequence which has not yet been shown to incur any functional differences between isoforms. The two promoters are functionally exclusive and governed by distinct sets of regulatory factors, so that glucokinase expression can be regulated separately in different tissue types. The two promoters correspond to two broad categories of glucokinase function: In liver, glucokinase acts as the gateway for the &quot;bulk processing&quot; of available glucose, while, in the neuroendocrine cells, it acts as a sensor, triggering cell responses that affect body-wide carbohydrate metabolism.

==Distribution among organ systems==
Glucokinase has been discovered in specific cells in four types of mammalian tissue: liver, pancreas, small intestine, and brain. All play crucial roles in responding to rising or falling levels of blood glucose.
*The predominant cells of the liver are the hepatocytes, and GK is found exclusively in these cells. During digestion of a carbohydrate meal, when blood glucose is plentiful and insulin levels are high, hepatocytes remove glucose from the blood and store it as glycogen. After completion of digestion and absorption, the liver manufactures glucose from both non-glucose substrates (gluconeogenesis) and glycogen (glycogenolysis), and exports it into the blood, to maintain adequate blood glucose levels during fasting. Because GK activity rises rapidly as the glucose concentration rises, it serves as a central metabolic switch to shift hepatic carbohydrate metabolism between fed and fasting states. Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by GK facilitates storage of glucose as glycogen and disposal by glycolysis. The separate liver promoter allows glucokinase to be regulated differently in hepatocytes than in the neuroendocrine cells.
*Neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas, gut, and brain share some common aspects of glucokinase production, regulation, and function. These tissues are collectively referred to as &quot;neuroendocrine&quot; cells in this context.
**Beta cells and alpha cells of the pancreatic islets
***Beta cells release insulin in response to rising levels of glucose. Insulin enables many types of cells to import and use glucose, and signals the liver to synthesize glycogen. Alpha cells produce less glucagon in response to rising glucose levels, and more glucagon if blood glucose is low. Glucagon serves as a signal to the liver to break down glycogen and release glucose into the blood. Glucokinase in beta cells serves as a glucose sensor, amplifying insulin secretion as blood glucose rises. 
***In the pancreatic beta-cell, glucokinase is a key regulator enzyme. Glucokinase is very important in the regulation of insulin secretion and has been known as the pancreatic beta-cell sensor. Mutations in the gene encoding glucokinase can cause both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia because of its central role in the regulation of insulin release.
**Glucose-sensitive neurons of the hypothalamus
***In response to rising or falling levels of glucose, cells in the hypothalamus polarize or depolarize. Among the neuroendocrine reactions of the central nervous system to hypoglycemia is activation of the adrenergic responses of the autonomic nervous system. Glucokinase likely serves as a glucose signal here as well. Glucokinase has also been found in cells of the anterior pituitary.
**Enterocytes of the small intestine
***This is the least-understood of the glucokinase sensor systems. It seems likely that responses to incoming glucose during digestion play a role in the incretin amplification of insulin secretion during a meal, or in the generation of satiety signals from gut to brain.

==Distribution among species==
Liver glucokinase occurs widely but not universally throughout vertebrate species. The gene structure and amino acid sequence are highly conserved among most mammals (e.g., rat and human glucokinase is more than 80% homologous). However, there are some unusual exceptions: For example, it has not been discovered in cats and bats, though some reptiles, birds, amphibians, and fish have it. Whether glucokinase occurs similarly in the pancreas and other organs has not yet been determined. It has been postulated that the presence of glucokinase in liver reflects the ease with which carbohydrates can be included in the animals&#x27; diets.

==Function and regulation==
Most of the glucokinase in a mammal is found in the liver, and glucokinase provides approximately 95% of the hexokinase activity in hepatocytes. Phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by glucokinase is the first step of both glycogen synthesis and glycolysis in the liver.

When ample glucose is available, glycogen synthesis proceeds at the periphery of the hepatocytes until the cells are replete with glycogen. Excess glucose is then increasingly converted into triglycerides for export and storage in adipose tissue. Glucokinase activity in the cytoplasm rises and falls with available glucose.

G6P, the product of glucokinase, is the principal substrate of glycogen synthesis, and glucokinase has a close functional and regulatory association with glycogen synthesis. When maximally active, GK and glycogen synthase appears to be located in the same peripheral areas of hepatocyte cytoplasm in which glycogen synthesis occurs. The supply of G6P affects the rate of glycogen synthesis not only as the primary substrate, but by direct stimulation of glycogen synthase and inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase.

Glucokinase activity can be rapidly amplified or damped in response to changes in the glucose supply, typically resulting from eating and fasting. Regulation occurs at several levels and speeds, and is influenced by many factors that affect mainly two general mechanisms:
#Glucokinase activity can be amplified or reduced in minutes by actions of the glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP). The actions of this protein are influenced by small molecules such as glucose and fructose.
#The amount of glucokinase can be increased by synthesis of new protein. Insulin is the principal signal for increased transcription, operating mainly by way of a transcription factor called sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) in the liver. This occurs within an hour after a rise in insulin levels, as after a carbohydrate meal. 

===Transcriptional===
Insulin acting via the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) is thought to be the most important direct activator of glucokinase gene transcription in hepatocytes. SREBP1c is a basic helix-loop-helix zipper (bHLHZ) transactivator. This class of transactivators bind to the &quot;E box&quot; sequence of genes for a number of regulatory enzymes. The liver promoter in the first exon of the glucokinase gene includes such an E box, which appears to be the principal insulin-response element of the gene in hepatocytes. It was previously thought that SREBP1c must be present for transcription of glucokinase in hepatocytes however, it was recently shown that glucokinase transcription was carried out normally in SREBP1c knock out mice. SREBP1c increases in response to a high-carbohydrate diet, presumed as a direct effect of frequent insulin elevation. Increased transcription can be detected in less than an hour after hepatocytes are exposed to rising insulin levels.

Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate () also stimulates GK transcription, it seems by way of Akt2 rather than SREBP1c. It is not known whether this effect is one of the downstream effects of activation of insulin receptors or independent of insulin action. Levels of play other amplifying roles in glycolysis in hepatocytes.

Other transacting factors suspected of playing a role in liver cell transcription regulation include:
# Hepatic nuclear factor-4-alpha (HNF4α) is an orphan nuclear receptor important in the transcription of many genes for enzymes of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It activates &quot;GCK&quot; transcription.
# Upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) is another basic helix-loop-helix zipper (bHLHZ) transactivator.
# Hepatic nuclear factor 6 (HNF6) is a homeodomain transcriptional regulator of the &quot;one-cut class.&quot; HNF6 is also involved in regulation of transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes such as glucose-6-phosphatase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.

===Hormonal and dietary===
Insulin is by far the most important of the hormones that have direct or indirect effects on glucokinase expression and activity in the liver. Insulin appears to affect both glucokinase transcription and activity through multiple direct and indirect pathways. While rising portal vein glucose levels increase glucokinase activity, the concomitant rise of insulin amplifies this effect by induction of glucokinase synthesis. Glucokinase transcription begins to rise within an hour of rising insulin levels. Glucokinase transcription becomes nearly undetectable in prolonged starvation, severe carbohydrate deprivation, or untreated insulin-deficient diabetes.

The mechanisms by which insulin induces glucokinase may involve both of the major intracellular pathways of insulin action, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) cascade, and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) cascade. The latter may operate via the FOXO1 transactivator.

However, as would be expected given its antagonistic effect on glycogen synthesis, glucagon and its intracellular second messenger cAMP suppresses glucokinase transcription and activity, even in the presence of insulin.

Other hormones such as triiodothyronine () and glucocorticoids provide permissive or stimulatory effects on glucokinase in certain circumstances. Biotin and retinoic acid increase GCK mRNA transcription as well as GK activity. Fatty acids in significant amounts amplify GK activity in the liver, while long chain acyl CoA inhibits it.

===Hepatic===
Glucokinase can be rapidly activated and inactivated in hepatocytes by a novel regulatory protein (glucokinase regulatory protein), which operates to maintain an inactive reserve of GK, which can be made quickly available in response to rising levels of portal vein glucose.

GKRP moves between nucleus and cytoplasm of the hepatocytes and may be tethered to the microfilament cytoskeleton. It forms reversible 1:1 complexes with GK, and can move it from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. It acts as a competitive inhibitor with glucose, such that the enzyme activity is reduced to near-zero while bound. GK:GKRP complexes are sequestered in the nucleus while glucose and fructose levels are low. Nuclear sequestration may serve to protect GK from degradation by cytoplasmic proteases. GK can be rapidly released from GKRP in response to rising levels of glucose. Unlike GK in beta cells, GK in hepatocytes is not associated with mitochondria.

Fructose in tiny (micromolar) amounts (after phosphorylation by ketohexokinase to fructose-1-phosphate (F1P)) accelerates release of GK from GKRP. This sensitivity to the presence of small amounts of fructose allows GKRP, GK, and ketohexokinase to act as a &quot;fructose sensing system,&quot; which signals that a mixed carbohydrate meal is being digested, and accelerates the utilization of glucose. However, fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) potentiates binding of GK by GKRP. F6P decreases phosphorylation of glucose by GK when glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis are underway. F1P and F6P both bind to the same site on GKRP. It is postulated that they produce 2 different conformations of GKRP, one able to bind GK and the other not.

===Pancreatic===
Although most of the glucokinase in the body is in the liver, smaller amounts in the beta and alpha cells of the pancreas, certain hypothalamic neurons, and specific cells (enterocytes) of the gut play an increasingly appreciated role in regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. In the context of glucokinase function, these cell types are collectively referred to as neuroendocrine tissues, and they share some aspects of glucokinase regulation and function, especially the common neuroendocrine promoter. Of the neuroendocrine cells, the beta cells of the pancreatic islets are the most-studied and best-understood. It is likely that many of the regulatory relationships discovered in the beta cells will also exist in the other neuroendocrine tissues with glucokinase.

====A signal for insulin====
In islet beta cells, glucokinase activity serves as a principal control for the secretion of insulin in response to rising levels of blood glucose. As G6P is consumed, increasing amounts of ATP initiate a series of processes that result in release of insulin. One of the immediate consequences of increased cellular respiration is a rise in the NADH and NADPH concentrations (collectively referred to as NAD(P)H). This shift in the redox status of the beta cells results in rising intracellular calcium levels, closing of the KATP channels, depolarization of the cell membrane, merging of the insulin secretory granules with the membrane, and release of insulin into the blood.

It is as a signal for insulin release that glucokinase exerts the largest effect on blood sugar levels and overall direction of carbohydrate metabolism. Glucose, in turn, influences both the immediate activity and the amount of glucokinase produced in the beta cells.

====Regulation in β cells====
Glucose immediately amplifies glucokinase activity by the cooperativity effect.

A second important rapid regulator of glucokinase activity in β cells occurs by direct protein-protein interaction between glucokinase and the &quot;bifunctional enzyme&quot; (phosphofructokinase-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase), which also plays a role in the regulation of glycolysis. This physical association stabilizes glucokinase in a catalytically favorable conformation (somewhat opposite the effect of GKRP binding) that enhances its activity.

In as little as 15 minutes, glucose can stimulate &quot;GCK&quot; transcription and glucokinase synthesis by way of insulin. Insulin is produced by the beta cells, but some of it acts on β cell B-type insulin receptors, providing an autocrine positive-feedback amplification of glucokinase activity. Further amplification occurs by insulin action (via A-type receptors) to stimulate its own transcription.

Transcription of the &quot;GCK&quot; gene is initiated through the &quot;upstream,&quot; or neuroendocrine, promoter. This promoter, in contrast to the liver promoter, has elements homologous to other insulin-induced gene promoters. Among the probable transacting factors are Pdx-1 and PPARγ. Pdx-1 is a homeodomain transcription factor involved in the differentiation of the pancreas. PPARγ is a nuclear receptor that responds to glitazone drugs by enhancing insulin sensitivity.

====Association with insulin secretory granules====
Much, but not all, of the glucokinase found in the cytoplasm of beta cells is associated with insulin secretory granules and with mitochondria. The proportion thus &quot;bound&quot; falls rapidly in response to rising glucose and insulin secretion. It has been suggested that binding serves a purpose similar to the hepatic glucokinase regulatory protein—protecting glucokinase from degradation so that it is rapidly available as the glucose rises. The effect is to amplify the glucokinase response to glucose more rapidly than transcription could do so.

====Suppression of glucagon in α cells====
It has also been proposed that glucokinase plays a role in the glucose sensing of the pancreatic α cells, but the evidence is less consistent, and some researchers have found no evidence of glucokinase activity in these cells. α cells occur in pancreatic islets, mixed with β and other cells. While β cells respond to rising glucose levels by secreting insulin, α cells respond by reducing glucagon secretion. When blood glucose concentration falls to hypoglycemic levels, α cells release glucagon. Glucagon is a protein hormone that blocks the effect of insulin on hepatocytes, inducing glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and reduced glucokinase activity in hepatocytes. The degree to which glucose suppression of glucagon is a direct effect of glucose via glucokinase in α cells, or an indirect effect mediated by insulin or other signals from beta cells, is still uncertain.

===Hypothalamic===
While all neurons use glucose for fuel, certain &quot;glucose-sensing neurons&quot; alter their firing rates in response to rising or falling levels of glucose. These glucose-sensing neurons are concentrated primarily in the ventromedial nucleus and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which regulate many aspects of glucose homeostasis (especially the response to hypoglycemia), fuel utilization, satiety and appetite, and weight maintenance. These neurons are most sensitive to glucose changes in the 0.5–3.5 mM glucose range.

Glucokinase has been found in the brain in largely the same areas that contain glucose-sensing neurons, including both of the hypothalamic nuclei. Inhibition of glucokinase abolishes the ventromedial nucleus response to a meal. However, brain glucose levels are lower than plasma levels, typically 0.5–3.5 mM. Although this range is matches the sensitivity of the glucose-sensing neurons, it is below the optimal inflection sensitivity for glucokinase. The presumption, based on indirect evidence and speculation, is that neuronal glucokinase is somehow exposed to plasma glucose levels even in the neurons.

===Enterocytes and incretin===
While glucokinase has been shown to occur in certain cells (enterocytes) of the small intestine and stomach, its function and regulation have not been worked out. It has been suggested that here, also, glucokinase serves as a glucose sensor, allowing these cells to provide one of the earliest metabolic responses to incoming carbohydrates. It is suspected that these cells are involved in incretin functions.

==Clinical significance==
Because insulin is one of, if not the most important, regulators of glucokinase synthesis, diabetes mellitus of all types diminishes glucokinase synthesis and activity by a variety of mechanisms. Glucokinase activity is sensitive to the oxidative stress of cells, especially the beta cells.

At least 497 mutations of the human glucokinase gene &quot;GCK&quot; have been discovered, that can change the efficiency of glucose binding and phosphorylation, increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of beta cell insulin secretion in response to glucose, and producing clinically significant hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

===Diabetes mellitus===
&quot;GCK&quot; mutations reduce the functional efficiency of the glucokinase molecule. Heterozygosity for alleles with reduced enzyme activity results in a higher threshold for insulin release and persistent, mild hyperglycemia. This condition is referred to as maturity onset diabetes of the young, type 2 (MODY2). The most recent overview of &quot;GCK&quot; mutation that were observed in patients claims 791 mutations, of which 489 are thought to cause the MODY diabetes and therefore reduce the functional efficiency of the glucokinase molecule.

Homozygosity for &quot;GCK&quot; alleles with reduced function can cause severe congenital insulin deficiency, resulting in persistent neonatal diabetes.

===Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia===
Some mutations have been found to enhance insulin secretion. Heterozygosity for gain of function mutations reduces the threshold glucose that triggers insulin release. This creates hypoglycemia of varying patterns, including transient or persistent congenital hyperinsulinism, or fasting or reactive hypoglycemia appearing at an older age. The most recent overview of &quot;GCK&quot; mutation that were observed in patients claimed 17 &quot;GCK&quot; mutations to cause hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.

Homozygosity for gain of function mutations has not been found.

==Research==
Several pharmaceutical companies are researching molecules that activate glucokinase in hope that it will be useful in the treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

<doc id="549615" wikidata="Q944734" url="?curid=549615" title="Chigwell">
<text>Chigwell is a town and civil parish in the Epping Forest District of Essex, England. It is part of the urban and metropolitan area of London, and is adjacent to the northern boundary of Greater London. It is on the Central line of the London Underground. In 2011 the parish had a population of 12,987.

==History==
The manor of Chigwell was held by Earl Harold under Edward the Confessor. From the 1550s it was the property of the Hicks Beach family. 

The parish church of St Mary the Virgin dates back to the 12th century and is a Grade II* listed building.
Opposite the church is the Kings Head Hotel, a 17th century coaching inn.

===Toponymy===
According to P. H. Reaney&#x27;s &quot;Place-Names of Essex&quot; the name means &#x27;Cicca&#x27;s well&#x27;, Cicca being an Anglo-Saxon personal name. In medieval sources the name appears with a variety of spellings including &quot;Cinghe uuella&quot; and Chikewelle&quot;. Folk etymology has sought to derive the name from a lost &quot;king&#x27;s well&quot;, supposed to have been to the south-east of the parish near the border of what is now the London Borough of Redbridge. There were several medicinal springs in Chigwell Row documented by Miller Christy in his book &quot;History of the mineral waters and medicinal springs of the county of Essex&quot;, published in 1910. The 18th-century historian Nathaniel Salmon stated that the &quot;-well&quot; element in the name derives from Anglo-Saxon &quot;weald&quot; (wood).

The land registration map of Redbridge Council shows &quot;Chig Well (site of)&quot; as being located to the rear of the house located at 67 Brocket Way, Chigwell.

===Economic development===
Traditionally a rural farming community, but now largely suburban, Chigwell was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. It is referred to by Charles Dickens in his novel &quot;Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of &#x27;Eighty&quot;; the Maypole Inn is based on the King&#x27;s Head inn, though the name was taken from the Maypole public house in Chigwell Row. It is likely Dickens was aware of both hostelries, since he frequently visited Chigwell, which he described in a letter to John Forster as &quot;the greatest place in the world ... Such a delicious old inn opposite the churchyard ... such beautiful forest scenery ... such an out of the way rural place...&quot;.

===Local government===
The Chigwell civil parish was part of Epping Rural District from 1894 to 1933, with local government split between Chigwell Parish Council, Epping Rural District Council and Essex County Council. Following a county review order in 1933, Chigwell formed together with Buckhurst Hill and Loughton the Chigwell Urban District, with the Chigwell Urban District Council replacing both the parish and rural district councils. When Greater London was created in 1965 a small, more densely populated section to the southeast was transferred to the London Borough of Redbridge; this area is now known as the Manford estate and continues to be within the Chigwell post town. The rest of Chigwell Urban District was incorporated into the Epping Forest District in 1974. Parish councils were re-established for Chigwell and Loughton, and for the first time in Buckhurst Hill, in 1996.

===RAF Chigwell===
From 1933 to 1958 there was an RAF presence at Roding Valley Meadows (near what is now the David Lloyd Leisure Centre). It served first to provide barrage balloon protection during the Second World War and was involved in the rollout of Britain&#x27;s coastal nuclear early warning system during the Cold War. In 1953 it briefly housed the RAF contingent taking part in the Coronation celebrations. Some of the RAF Chigwell site is now part of the Local Nature Reserve, Roding Valley Meadows LNR.

==Governance==
The local council of the civil parish is Chigwell Parish Council. The parish council originally existed from 1894 to 1933, and was created again in 1996. The parish council offices are located on Hainault Road. Councillors are elected from three wards: Grange Hill, Chigwell Row and Chigwell Village. Local councillors are also elected to Epping Forest District Council and Essex County Council.

==Geography==

The hamlet of Chigwell Row lies towards the east of Chigwell, near Lambourne; this part of the parish is well forested and mostly rural. Grange Hill is the area around the junction of Manor Road and Fencepiece Road/Hainault Road, extending as far as the boundary with Redbridge including the Limes Farm estate. Chigwell has a population of around 12,500 and is generally considered a wealthy area, characterised by large suburban houses, notably in Manor Road, Hainault Road and Chigwell High Road, which featured in the popular English situation comedy &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; (although many of the outside locations used in that programme were not in Chigwell).

==Education==

Schools in the area include Chigwell Primary Academy, Limes Farm Infants School &amp; Nursery, Limes Farm Junior School, Guru Gobind Singh Khalsa College, West Hatch High School and Chigwell School, a private school, which was founded from a bequest by Samuel Harsnett, Archbishop of York, in 1629, among whose past pupils are William Penn, who later went on to found Pennsylvania, and actor Sir Ian Holm. The diarist John Aubrey recorded that it was at Chigwell School that Penn had a mystical vision, which influenced his later conversion to Quakerism. The original 17th-century schoolroom where Penn was taught still stands, and is now the school library.

==Culture==

Tottenham Hotspur Football Club had its training facilities in the area until May 2012, when it moved to a new facility in Enfield, northeast London. However, the club still runs training sessions for local youth on the Limes Farm estate through the summer months. Many past and present players and staff have homes in the area. Leyton Orient Football Club also have a training ground in Chigwell, adjacent to Chigwell School&#x27;s fields.

A David Lloyd Leisure Centre, situated off Roding Road by the M11 motorway, contains indoor and outdoor tennis courts, swimming pools and gymnasium. Also in the area are a Holmes Place Health Club, Topgolf playing Centre and Chigwell Golf Club. Chigwell Cricket Club is based at the Old Chigwellians Club in Roding Lane. Chigwell also plays host to the Old Loughtonians Hockey Club.

There are two pubs, the King William IV and the Two Brewers.

Ye Olde King&#x27;s Head, which was operated as a pub until 2011, is said to be the Maypole Inn in Dickens&#x27; &quot;Barnaby Rudge&quot;. The building was subsequently sold to local resident Lord Sugar&#x27;s property company Amsprop which now leases the Grade I Listed building to the Sheesh Turkish restaurant.

Until their closure in 2002, Chigwell had night clubs, known collectively as the Epping Forest Country Club. There is a Local Nature Reserve at Roding Valley Meadows off Roding Lane which follows the River Roding up to Loughton.

The TV series &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot; was set in Chigwell.

==Transport==

All bus services are Transport for London services, except the 804. Route 150 just penetrates into Chigwell Row. Routes 362 and 462 serve only Grange Hill. Route 275 just passes through Tomswood Road and the westernmost section of Manor Road. Chigwell is served by Chigwell station and Grange Hill station (further south bordering Hainault), both on the Central line of the London Underground. For a more frequent service to London there are also nearby Buckhurst Hill, Woodford, Loughton and Hainault stations as services between Grange Hill and Woodford are limited to three trains per hour in each direction, with an increased service during morning peak hours.

<text>The Battle of Harpers Ferry was fought September 12–15, 1862, as part of the Maryland Campaign of the American Civil War. As Confederate Army General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Confederate army invaded Maryland, a portion of his army under Major General Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson surrounded, bombarded, and captured the Union garrison at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia).

As Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia advanced down the Shenandoah Valley into Maryland, he planned to capture the garrison at Harpers Ferry to secure his line of supply back to Virginia. Although he was being pursued at a leisurely pace by Major General George B. McClellan&#x27;s Army of the Potomac, outnumbering him more than two to one, Lee chose the risky strategy of dividing his army and sent one portion to converge and attack Harpers Ferry from three directions. Colonel Dixon S. Miles, Union commander at Harpers Ferry, insisted on keeping most of the troops near the town instead of taking up commanding positions on the surrounding heights. The slim defenses of the most important position, Maryland Heights, first encountered the approaching Confederates on September 12, but only brief skirmishing ensued. Strong attacks by two Confederate brigades on September 13 drove the Union troops from the heights.

During the fighting on Maryland Heights, the other Confederate columns arrived and were astonished to see that critical positions to the west and south of town were not defended. Jackson methodically positioned his artillery around Harpers Ferry and ordered Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to move down the west bank of the Shenandoah River in preparation for a flank attack on the Federal left the next morning. By the morning of September 15, Jackson had positioned nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and at the base of Loudoun Heights. He began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless and agreed with his subordinates to raise the white flag of surrender. Before he could surrender personally, he was mortally wounded by an artillery shell and died the next day. After processing more than 12,000 Union prisoners, Jackson&#x27;s men then rushed to Sharpsburg, Maryland, to rejoin Lee for the Battle of Antietam.

==Background==
Harpers Ferry is a small town at the confluence of the Potomac River and the Shenandoah River, the site of a historic Federal arsenal founded by President George Washington in 1799 and a bridge for the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad across the Potomac. In 1859 it was the site of the abolitionist John Brown&#x27;s attack on the Federal arsenal.

At the time the garrison at Harpers Ferry – officially the Railroad Brigade of the Middle Department, Eighth Army Corps, the purpose of which was to protect the strategically vital Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, where they passed through the area, and the lower Shenandoah Valley—was the last remaining sizable Union force south of the Potomac River, consisting of about 10,400 men, later joined by 2,500 from the Union garrison at Martinsburg—plus a large cache of small arms as well as artillery pieces, wagons, and Union uniforms. The town was virtually indefensible, as it was dominated on all sides by higher ground. To the west, the ground rose gradually for about a mile and a half to Bolivar Heights, a plateau high, that stretches from the Potomac to the Shenandoah; further west and parallel was Schoolhouse Ridge. To the south, across the Shenandoah, Loudoun Heights overlooks from . And to the northeast, across the Potomac, the southernmost extremity of Elk Ridge forms the 1,476-foot-high crest of Maryland Heights. A Federal soldier wrote that if these three heights could not be held, Harpers Ferry would be &quot;no more defensible than a well bottom.&quot;

As Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia (ANV) advanced into Maryland, Lee expected that the Union garrisons that potentially blocked his supply line in the Shenandoah Valley, at Winchester, Martinsburg, and Harpers Ferry, would be cut off and abandoned without firing a shot, but the garrisons, Harpers Ferry specifically, were still manned. Lee planned to capture the garrison to secure his logistical support and potential retreat back to Virginia.

Although he was being pursued at a measured pace by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and the Union Army of the Potomac, which outnumbered him by more than two to one, Lee chose the risky strategy of dividing his army in order to seize Harpers Ferry. While the rest of the ANV remained at Boonsboro—later minus the corps of Maj. Gen. James Longstreet which Lee sent north to Hagerstown to protect against the reported movement of Pennsylvania militia there, which proved illusory—Lee sent three columns of troops to converge and attack Harpers Ferry from separate directions. The largest column, 11,500 men under Jackson, was to recross the Potomac and circle around to the west of Harpers Ferry and attack it from Bolivar Heights, while the other two columns, under Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws (8,000 men) and Brig. Gen. John George Walker (3,400), were to capture Maryland Heights and Loudoun Heights respectively, commanding the town from the east and south.

McClellan had wanted to add the Harpers Ferry garrison to his field army, but general-in-chief Henry Halleck had refused, saying that the movement would be too difficult and that the garrison had to defend itself &quot;until the latest moment,&quot; or until McClellan could relieve it. Halleck had probably expected its commander, Col. Dixon Stansbury Miles, to show some military knowledge and courage. Miles was a 38-year veteran of the U.S. Army and the Mexican–American War, but who had been disgraced after the First Battle of Bull Run when a court of inquiry held that he had been drunk during the battle. Miles swore off liquor and was sent to the supposedly quiet post at Harpers Ferry. His garrison comprised 14,000 men, many inexperienced, including 2,500 who had been forced out of Martinsburg by the approach of Jackson&#x27;s men on September 11.

On the night of September 11, McLaws arrived at Brownsville, 6 miles northeast of Harpers Ferry. He left 3,000 men near Brownsville Gap to protect his rear and moved 3,000 others toward the Potomac River to seal off any eastern escape route from Harpers Ferry. He dispatched the veteran brigades of Brig. Gens. Joseph B. Kershaw and William Barksdale to seize Maryland Heights on September 12. The other Confederate columns were making slow progress and were behind schedule. Jackson&#x27;s men were delayed at Martinsburg. Walker&#x27;s men were ordered to destroy the aqueduct carrying the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal across the Monocacy River where it empties into the Potomac, but his engineers had difficulty demolishing the stone structure and the attempt was eventually abandoned.

Walker reentered Virginia, in Loudoun County on September 9, across from Point of Rocks. Walker was escorted by Col. E.V. White, Loudoun native, and his 35th Virginia Cavalry Battalion. White was unhappy with the assignment and preferred to be with the rest of the army. Unfortunately White had gotten into an altercation with Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart in Frederick and was subsequently ordered back to Virginia by Lee. White led Walker on a meandering route around the Short Hill Mountain to reach the base of Loudoun Heights four days later on September 13. So the attack on Harpers Ferry that had been planned for September 11 was delayed, increasing the risk that McClellan might engage and destroy a portion of Lee&#x27;s army while it was divided.

==Battle==

===September 12===

Miles divided his 10,400 garrison troops into four brigades, making sure that the raw, inexperienced men he had recently received were balanced by more experienced soldiers. He positioned two brigades, about 7,000 men, on Bolivar Heights, in a line that stretched from the Potomac River to the Shenandoah. On nearby Camp Hill, he placed a 1,000-man brigade of heavy artillery and supporting infantry to cover the position on Bolivar Heights. Miles did not position men on Loudoun Heights, considering it the least important of the heights as he deemed it too difficult for Confederate artillery to be placed there; in any event, any Rebel force there could be attacked by the artillery on Maryland Heights. Miles did not believe that the Rebels would come by that route, and would instead approach via Bolivar Heights. 

The defenses of the most important position, Maryland Heights, were designed to fight off raiders, but not to hold the heights themselves. There was a powerful artillery battery halfway up the heights: two naval Dahlgren rifles, one 50-pounder Parrott rifle, and four 12-pounder smoothbores, which could protect the Camp Hill and Bolivar Heights positions. On the crest, Miles assigned Col. Thomas H. Ford of the 32nd Ohio Infantry to command parts of four regiments, 1,600 men. Some of these men, including those of the 126th New York, had been in the Army only 21 days and lacked basic combat skills; they had only just arrived at Harpers Ferry. They erected primitive breastworks and sent skirmishers a quarter-mile in the direction of the Confederates. On September 12 they encountered the approaching men from Kershaw&#x27;s South Carolina brigade, who had been moving slowly through the very difficult terrain on Elk Ridge. Rifle volleys from behind abatis caused the Confederates to stop for the night.

===September 13===
Kershaw began his attack at about 6:30 a.m., September 13. He planned to push his own brigade directly against the Union breastworks while Barksdale&#x27;s Mississippians flanked the Federal right. Kershaw&#x27;s men charged into the abatis twice and were driven back with heavy losses. The inexperienced New York troops were holding their own. Their commander, Col. Ford, felt ill that morning and stayed back two miles (3 km) behind the lines, leaving the fighting to Col. Eliakim Sherrill, the second-ranking officer. Sherrill was wounded by a minié ball through the cheek and tongue while rallying his men and had to be carried from the field, making the green troops grow panicky. As Barksdale&#x27;s Mississippians approached on the flank, the New Yorkers broke and fled rearward. Although Maj. Sylvester Hewitt ordered the remaining units to reform farther along the ridge, orders came at 3:30 p.m. from Col. Ford to retreat. (In doing so, he apparently neglected to send for the 900 men of the 115th New York, waiting in reserve midway up the slope.) His men destroyed their artillery pieces and crossed a pontoon bridge back to Harpers Ferry. Ford later insisted he had the authority from Miles to order the withdrawal, but a court of inquiry concluded that he had &quot;abandoned his position without sufficient cause,&quot; and recommended his dismissal from the Army.

During the fighting on Maryland Heights, the other Confederate columns arrived—Walker to the base of Loudoun Heights at 10 a.m. and Jackson&#x27;s three divisions (Brig. Gen. John R. Jones to the north, Brig. Gen. Alexander R. Lawton in the center, and Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to the south) to the west of Bolivar Heights at 11 a.m.—and were astonished to see that these positions were not defended. Inside the town, the Union officers realized they were surrounded and pleaded with Miles to attempt to recapture Maryland Heights, but he refused, insisting that the force on Bolivar Heights would protect the town. He exclaimed, &quot;I am ordered to hold this place and God damn my soul to hell if I don&#x27;t.&quot; In fact, Jackson&#x27;s and Miles&#x27;s forces to the west of town were roughly equal, but Miles was ignoring the threat from the artillery massing to his northeast and south.

Late that night, Miles sent Capt. Charles Russell of the 1st Maryland Cavalry with nine troopers to slip through the enemy lines and take a message to McClellan, or any other general he could find, informing them that the besieged town could hold out only for 48 hours. Otherwise, he would be forced to surrender. Russell&#x27;s men slipped across South Mountain and reached McClellan&#x27;s headquarters at Frederick. The general was surprised and dismayed to receive the news. He wrote a message to Miles that a relief force was on the way and told him, &quot;Hold out to the last extremity. If it is possible, re-occupy the Maryland Heights with your whole force.&quot; McClellan ordered Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin and his VI Corps to march from Crampton&#x27;s Gap to relieve Miles. Although three couriers were sent with this information on different routes, none of them reached Harpers Ferry in time.

===September 14===

While battles raged at the passes on South Mountain, Jackson had methodically positioned his artillery around Harpers Ferry. This included four Parrott rifles to the summit of Maryland Heights, a task that required 200 men wrestling the ropes of each gun. Although Jackson wanted all of his guns to open fire simultaneously, Walker on Loudoun Heights grew impatient and began an ineffectual bombardment with five guns shortly after 1 p.m. Jackson ordered A.P. Hill to move down the west bank of the Shenandoah in preparation for a flank attack on the Federal left the next morning.

That night, the Union officers realized they had less than 24 hours left, but they made no attempt to recapture Maryland Heights. Unbeknownst to Miles, only a single Confederate regiment now occupied the crest, after McLaws had withdrawn the remainder to meet the Union assault at Crampton&#x27;s Gap.

Col. Benjamin F. &quot;Grimes&quot; Davis proposed to Miles that his troopers of the 8th New York Cavalry, the Loudoun Rangers, the 12th Illinois Cavalry and some smaller units from Maryland and Rhode Island, attempt to break out. Cavalry forces were essentially useless in the defense of the town. Miles dismissed the idea as &quot;wild and impractical,&quot; but Davis was adamant and Miles relented when he saw that the fiery Mississippian intended to break out, with or without permission. Davis and Col. Arno Voss led their 1,400 cavalrymen out of Harpers Ferry on a pontoon bridge across the Potomac, turning left onto a narrow road that wound to the west around the base of Maryland Heights in the north toward Sharpsburg. Despite a number of close calls with returning Confederates from South Mountain, the cavalry column encountered a wagon train approaching from Hagerstown with James Longstreet&#x27;s reserve supply of ammunition. They were able to trick the wagoneers into following them in another direction and they repulsed the Confederate cavalry escort in the rear of the column, and the southern teamsters found themselves surrounded by Federals in the morning. Capturing more than 40 enemy ordnance wagons, Davis had lost not a single man in combat, the first great cavalry exploit of the war for the Army of the Potomac.

===September 15===
At dawn, McLaws&#x27; repositioning of his Confederate troops—8,000 men in two lines across the floor of Pleasant Valley—was revealed to Franklin, who had been tasked by McClellan to &quot;cut off, destroy or capture McLaws&#x27; command and relieve Colonel Miles.&quot; It was a bluff by McLaws, and it worked because Franklin was convinced that he was outnumbered two-to-one and that it would be &quot;suicidal to attack&quot; the Confederate formation. The deceived Franklin thus halted only six miles from Harpers Ferry; there would be no relief for Miles&#x27; garrison.

By the morning of September 15, Jackson had positioned nearly 50 guns on Maryland Heights and at the base of Loudoun Heights, prepared to enfilade the rear of the Federal line on Bolivar Heights. Jackson began a fierce artillery barrage from all sides and ordered an infantry assault for 8 a.m. Miles realized that the situation was hopeless. He had no expectation that relief would arrive from McClellan in time and his artillery ammunition was in short supply. At a council of war with his brigade commanders, he agreed to raise the white flag of surrender. But he would not be personally present at any ceremony. He was confronted by a captain of the 126th New York Infantry, who said, &quot;For ——&#x27;s sake, Colonel, don&#x27;t surrender us. Don&#x27;t you hear the signal guns? Our forces are near us. Let us cut our way out and join them.&quot; But Miles replied, &quot;Impossible. They will blow us out of this place in half an hour.&quot; As the captain turned away in disdain, a shell exploded, shattering Miles&#x27;s left leg. So disgusted were the men of the garrison with Miles&#x27;s behavior, which some claimed involved being drunk again, it was difficult to find a man who would take him to the hospital. He was mortally wounded and died the next day. Some historians have speculated that Miles was struck deliberately by fire from his own men. With Miles incapacitated, the formal surrender of the garrison to Jackson was undertaken by Brigadier General Julius White—a political general who had commanded the Union forces from the Martinsburg garrison, and who had come to Harper&#x27;s Ferry with his troops, but, although senior to Miles, had not taken command of the garrison there, deferring instead to the commander on the scene.

==Aftermath==
Jackson had achieved victory at minor expense. The Confederate Army sustained 286 casualties (39 killed, 247 wounded), mostly from the fighting on Maryland Heights, while the Union Army sustained 12,636 (44 killed, 173 wounded, 12,419 captured). It was the largest surrender of Federal forces during the Civil War, and the largest number of United States troops to surrender until the fall of Bataan in the Philippines during World War II. The Union garrison also surrendered 13,000 small arms, 200 wagons, and 73 artillery pieces. The list of captured artillery pieces included one 50-pounder Parrott rifle (spiked), six M1841 24-pounder howitzers, four 20-pounder Parrott rifles, eight M1841 12-pounder field guns (2 spiked), four 12-pounder Napoleons (2 spiked), six M1841 6-pounder field guns, two 10-pounder Dahlgren guns (spiked), 10 3-inch Ordnance rifles, and six 3-inch James rifles.

Confederate soldiers feasted on Union food supplies and helped themselves to fresh blue Federal uniforms, which would cause some confusion in the coming days. About the only unhappy men in Jackson&#x27;s force were the cavalrymen, who had hoped to replenish their exhausted mounts, but were not able to because of Col. Grimes Davis&#x27; breakout.

Jackson sent off a courier to Lee with the news. &quot;Through God&#x27;s blessing, Harper&#x27;s Ferry and its garrison are to be surrendered.&quot; As he rode into town to supervise his men, Union prisoners lined the roadside, eager for a look at the famous Stonewall. One of them observed Jackson&#x27;s dirty, seedy uniform and remarked, &quot;Boys, he isn&#x27;t much for looks, but if we&#x27;d had him we wouldn&#x27;t have been caught in this trap.&quot; By early afternoon, Jackson received an urgent message from General Lee, telling him to get his troops to Sharpsburg as quickly as possible. Jackson left A.P. Hill at Harpers Ferry to manage the parole of Federal prisoners and began marching to join the Battle of Antietam.

==Inquiry==
The War Department appointed a special commission under Major General David Hunter to determine the reasons for the loss at Harpers Ferry. During 15 days of testimony, resulting in over 900 pages of evidence, the commission focused on Miles&#x27; competence and loyalty, his defense of the garrison, the action of his subordinate officers, and missed opportunities for escape and rescue. 

The commission found that a primary cause of the defeat lay in the actions of Colonel Thomas H. Ford in his defense of Maryland Heights, which it found to be &quot;without ability&quot;. Ford&#x27;s abandonment of his post was seen to be without sufficient cause, and his general military capacity was determined to be of nature as to disqualify him from further military command. General John E. Wool, who as commander of the Middle Department in Baltimore was Miles&#x27; superior until he was placed under McClellan&#x27;s orders, and who had ordered Miles to defend &quot;at all hazards&quot; the indefensible position, received censure for putting Miles in command at Harpers Ferry. General McClellan also came in for criticism for failing to relieve and protect the garrison.

Finally, although Colonel Miles was dead, and the commission expressed some reluctance to criticize an officer who could not speak on his own behalf, he was nevertheless described as having &quot;incapacity, amounting to almost imbecility [for] the shameful surrender of this important post.&quot; The commission opined that if McClellan&#x27;s forces had been faster to reach Harpers Ferry, or if Miles had managed to hold on without surrendering so quickly, &quot;the enemy would have been forced to raise the siege, or have been taken in detail.&quot;

General Henry Halleck—who, as General-in-Chief had refused McClellan&#x27;s request to attach the Harpers Ferry garrison to the Army of the Potomac, thus denying him an additional 11,000 troops, and leaving Miles in an untenable situation—was not mentioned in the commission&#x27;s criticism.

==Battlefield preservation==

The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield in nine acquisitions since 2002, much of which has been incorporated into the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, which also preserves portions of the battlefield. Additional areas are preserved within the Harpers Ferry Historic District and the National Register of Historic Places listed B &amp; O Railroad Potomac River Crossing.

<doc id="549620" wikidata="Q507177" url="?curid=549620" title="Harold H. Burton">
<text>Harold Hitz Burton (June 22, 1888 – October 28, 1964) was an American politician and lawyer. He served as the 45th mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, as a U.S. Senator from Ohio, and as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

Born in Boston, Burton practiced law in Cleveland after graduating from Harvard Law School. After serving in the United States Army during World War I, Burton became active in Republican Party politics and won election to the Ohio House of Representatives. After serving as the mayor of Cleveland, Burton won election to the United States Senate in 1940. After the retirement of Associate Justice Owen J. Roberts, President Harry S. Truman successfully nominated Burton to the Supreme Court. Burton served on the Court until 1958, when he was succeeded by Potter Stewart.

Burton was known as a dispassionate, pragmatic, somewhat plodding jurist who preferred to rule on technical and procedural rather than constitutional grounds. He was also seen as an affable justice who helped ease tension on the court during an extremely acrimonious time. He wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath&quot; (1951) and &quot;Lorain Journal Co. v. United States&quot; (1951). He also helped shape the Court&#x27;s unanimous decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954).

==Early life==
Harold Hitz Burton was born in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, the second son of Anna Gertrude (Hitz) and Alfred Edgar Burton. His older brother was named Felix Arnold Burton. Harold&#x27;s father was an engineer and the first Dean of Student Affairs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1902-1921), reporting to the president. He taught at MIT before being selected as dean. As a former explorer, Burton had accompanied Robert Peary on several expeditions to the North Pole.

Harold&#x27;s mother died young. In 1906, his father married Lena Yates, a poet and artist from England who later took the name of Jeanne D&#x27;Orge. They met that year on a walking trip in France. Yates published children&#x27;s books as Lena Dalkeith. The couple had three children: Christine, Virginia (1909–1968), and Alexander Ross Burton. The half siblings developed warm relationships over time. Virginia became an author and illustrator.

Burton attended Bowdoin College, where he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, was quarterback of the football team, and graduated summa cum laude. His roommate and Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Theta chapter) brother was Owen Brewster, later a U.S. Senator from Maine. Burton went on to Harvard Law School, graduating in 1912.

Felix Arnold Burton became an architect after also attending Bowdoin. The Burton brothers and J. Edgar Hoover were second cousins on their mothers&#x27; side. Their common great-grandparents were Johannes (Hans) Hitz, first Swiss Consul General to the United States, and his wife Anna Kohler.

==Marriage and family==
Burton married Selma Florence Smith in 1912. They had four children: Barbara (Mrs. Charles Weidner), William (who served on the USS Samuel B. Roberts (DE-413) during WWII, in the Ohio House of Representatives and was a noted trial lawyer), Deborah (Mrs. Wallace Adler), and Robert (a distinguished attorney and counsel to athletes).

==Early career==
After graduation and marriage, Burton moved with his wife to Cleveland and began the practice of law there. However, in 1914, he joined his wife&#x27;s uncle as a company attorney for Utah Power and Light Company in Salt Lake City. He later worked for Utah Light and Traction, and then for Idaho Power Company and Boise Valley Traction Company, both in Boise, Idaho.

== Military service ==
Burton&#x27;s interest in military service was evident from his high school years at West Newton, where military training was part of the curriculum. He aspired to attend the United States Naval Academy but was prevented from doing so due to a slight heart murmur. Instead, he attended Bowdoin College and later Harvard Law School, but his fascination with military affairs persisted.

Anticipating the United States&#x27;s involvement in World War I, Burton attended a military training camp in Salt Lake City in 1916. After the U.S. declared war in April 1917, he enlisted in the United States Army in May 1917. He attended officer training at the Presidio in San Francisco, graduating as a second lieutenant after three months.

Assigned to the 361st Infantry Regiment of the 91st Infantry Division at Camp Lewis near Tacoma, Washington, Burton commanded Company A. He trained his men rigorously, aiming for high performance standards. Burton developed a close relationship with his regimental commander, Colonel William Davis, who became a mentor to him.

In June 1918, Burton was sent to France ahead of his division to attend a field officer school. Upon completing the course, he rejoined his regiment near Saint-Mihiel in August 1918. He was appointed as the regimental operations officer, a new role responsible for ensuring that orders were effectively communicated and executed throughout the regiment.

Burton first saw combat during the Meuse–Argonne Offensive. On September 26, 1918, he and Colonel Davis left their command post to follow the first wave of the offensive. Burton was responsible for overseeing movements and maintaining communications within the regiment, often risking his life to deliver orders under heavy fire. The unit included the Cleveland Grays. During this period, he narrowly avoided several artillery attacks and once captured two German snipers despite being unarmed.

Promoted to captain, Burton also served as assistant regimental adjutant. After eight days of intense combat, the regiment was relieved on October 4, 1918. The 91st Division was then transferred to Belgium to assist French forces. During operations near Audenarde, Burton took command of the regiment&#x27;s forces in the city after Colonel Davis was killed by artillery fire. He established his command post in the town hall, continuing operations despite ongoing shelling.

For his service, Burton received several decorations. He was awarded the Belgian Croix de guerre on December 17, 1918, &quot;for extraordinary heroism and gallantry in action during the advance from the Lys to beyond the Scheldt River in the vicinity of Audenarde, Belgium.&quot; He also received a Meritorious Citation Certificate from General John J. Pershing &quot;for exceptionally meritorious and conspicuous services during the Argonne Offensive.&quot;

After the Armistice on November 11, 1918, Burton remained in Europe for occupation duties until 1919. Upon returning to the United States, he was honorably discharged at Camp Sherman in Ohio, rejoined his family in Cleveland, resumed his law practice, and taught at Western Reserve University Law School. Continuing his military involvement, Burton served as a captain in the Ohio National Guard with the 331st Infantry Regiment, 83rd Infantry Division, for nearly two decades. In 1921, he authored the regimental history of the 361st Infantry Regiment, titled &quot;600 Days&#x27; Service&quot; and joined several veterans&#x27; organizations, including the Army and Navy Union, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the American Legion.

==Politics==

In the late 1920s, Burton entered politics as a Republican. He was elected to the East Cleveland Board of Education in 1927 and to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1928. After serving briefly in the Ohio House, he became law director for the City of Cleveland in 1929 before returning to private practice in 1932.

In 1935, Burton was elected mayor of Cleveland. He worked on issues of continuing assimilation of immigrant populations, supporting industry in the city, and dealing with transportation needs. Re-elected twice, he served until entering the U.S. Senate in 1941. For his decorous personal life and opposition to organized crime, he was dubbed &quot;the Boy Scout Mayor.&quot;

In 1940, Burton was elected to the U.S. Senate, with 52.3% of the vote, defeating John McSweeney. He served on the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, which monitored the U.S. war effort during World War II. Also on the committee was then-Senator Harry S. Truman.

==Supreme Court==
===Nomination===
Justice Owen J. Roberts announced his resignation from the Supreme Court on June 30, 1945, effective July 31, 1945. President Truman decided, as a bipartisan gesture, to appoint a Republican to replace him. He selected Burton as someone whom he knew and respected. Burton&#x27;s nomination was presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 18, and the Senate unanimously approved it the next day. Burton resigned from the Senate on September 30, 1945, and was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court on October 1. Burton was the last sitting member of Congress to be appointed to the Court. (Sherman Minton, a former senator, was appointed in 1949.)

===Judicial philosophy and working style===
According to biographer Eric W. Rise, Burton appeared to lack an overarching judicial philosophy. He favored judicial restraint and most of his decisions were based on narrow procedural grounds rather than the Constitution. His judicial restraint, however, was informed by his political views, not by a legal philosophy, and he tended to defer to legislative and executive branch judgments because he agreed with them personally. This pragmatism won him the respect of his fellow justices, and served as a unifying influence on the Court when the other justices were split on constitutional issues but could come together on technical or procedural grounds.

From 1945 to 1953, Burton was usually in the centrist majority on the court, sometimes finding himself in a slightly more conservative majority on some issues. He was part of the &quot;Vinson bloc&quot;, which included Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Associate Justices Tom C. Clark, Sherman Minton, and Stanley Forman Reed. These five voted together 75 percent of the time in non-unanimous decisions. However, beginning with the appointment of Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1953, and more so after the appointment of William J. Brennan Jr. in 1956, Burton found himself increasingly in the minority.

Burton biographer Mary Frances Berry has written that Burton knew &quot;he was not brilliant and that writing came hard&quot;, and therefore not only worked very hard on his decisions but attempted to show this work by outlining all the precedents he had considered before reaching a conclusion. Burton insisted on having all precedents researched before writing his opinions, wrote the first draft of his opinions himself, and was well known for working long hours in his office. His hard work earned him respect and praise from his colleagues, but his working style also limited his judicial output. Outside the Court, the press and some prominent legal scholars depicted Burton as mediocre, plodding, a weak legal mind, and more concerned with social activities.

Burton was also very well-liked by all his colleagues, and his easy-going nature helped to ease tensions on the Court.

===Cold War, loyalty oath, and subversion rulings===
The Cold War led state and federal governments to enact a wide variety of laws and regulations aimed at curbing espionage and subversion. Burton consistently showed deference to government restrictions on free speech, voting to uphold government action 27 out of 28 times. He also wrote several important decisions. His basic approach toward these questions was judicial deference, as exemplified in his strong dissent in &quot;Duncan v. Kahanamoku&quot;, 327 U.S. 304 (1946). His first important majority opinion came in &quot;Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath&quot;, 341 U.S. 123 (1951), where a group had challenged the authority of the U.S. Attorney General to unilaterally declare groups to be Communist. Despite a significant split among the justices, Burton wrote a plurality decision in which he disposed of the case on technical grounds. He argued that the listing was technically legal but that in a court of law the Attorney General had to offer evidence of subversion, which he had not.

Burton also joined the majority in three important Fifth Amendment cases. In &quot;Emspak v. United States&quot;, 349 U.S. 190 (1955), he voted with the majority to extend the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to testimony before congressional committees. He also joined the majority in &quot;Ullmann v. United States&quot;, 350 U.S. 422 (1956), an important decision which upheld the Immunity Act of 1954 (which stripped the right against self-incrimination from persons given immunity from federal prosecution). Burton&#x27;s narrow procedural approach proved important in &quot;Beilan v. Board of Education&quot;, 357 U.S. 399 (1958). Two years earlier, six justices had formed a majority in &quot;Slochower v. Board of Higher Education of New York City&quot;, 350 U.S. 551 (1956), holding it unconstitutional for a school board to fire an employee for exercising their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. In &quot;Beilan&quot;, a teacher was dismissed not for exercising Fifth Amendment rights but for refusing to answer a question at all. Despite the retirement of Sherman Minton (who had joined his dissent in &quot;Slochower&quot;), Burton&#x27;s narrow procedural approach in &quot;Beilan&quot; won over Justices Felix Frankfurter and John Marshall Harlan II and (with the support of new Justice Charles Evans Whittaker), Burton was able form a majority upholding the school district&#x27;s action.

At times, Burton&#x27;s pragmatism could lead to important legislative outcomes. He joined the 7-to-1 majority in &quot;Jencks v. United States&quot;, 353 U.S. 657 (1957), in which the Court reversed the conviction of a labor leader under federal loyalty laws because the defendant was not given permission to view the evidence against him. Burton agreed with the majority, although he added the caveat that such evidence should first be reviewed by a district court judge to ensure that no national security secrets were revealed. Burton&#x27;s view was subsequently adopted by Congress with passage of the Jencks Act in 1958.

In one of his last opinions in the area, Burton voted to limit the application of the Smith Act in &quot;Yates v. United States&quot;, 354 U.S. 298 (1957). The majority had overturned the conviction of seven individuals using the &quot;clear and present danger&quot; First Amendment doctrine by concluding they had advocated violent overthrow of the government as an abstract doctrine, not as advocacy to action. Burton wrote an opinion concurring in the outcome, but cast his vote on narrow procedural grounds.

===Church and state===
Generally, Burton favored a strict separation of church and state. But his pragmatic approach to law sometimes caused him to dissent from majorities favoring a strict separation. For example, in &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot;, 330 U.S. 1 (1947), Justice Hugo Black&#x27;s 5-4 majority opinion held that while the Constitution required a strict separation between church and state, it was constitutionally permissible for a school district to reimburse parents when their children rode public school buses to religious schools so long as all such parents and religions were treated equally. Burton initially was predisposed to declare the law constitutional. Heavy lobbying from justices Felix Frankfurter, Robert H. Jackson, and Wiley Blount Rutledge changed his mind. Burton dissented in the case not because he disagreed with Black&#x27;s emphasis on the strict separation between church and state but because he believed that the state law violated the strict separation doctrine laid out by Black.

The following year, Burton joined Black in the majority in &quot;McCollum v. Board of Education&quot;, 333 U.S. 203 (1948). At issue was a state law which gave students &quot;release time&quot; to attend religious instruction on school grounds during the school day. The majority struck down the law as a violation of the First Amendment. Burton joined the majority only after Black agreed not to extend his ruling to release time programs that involved off-site religious instruction.

&quot;Zorach v. Clauson&quot;, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), was factually similar to &quot;McCollum&quot;, although there was no instruction on school grounds. Although Burton&#x27;s law clerks argued that the school was tacitly instructing children to attend religious classes, Burton disagreed, characterizing the dismissal as akin to excusing a child from school for a doctor&#x27;s appointment. Burton joined the 6-to-3 majority.

===Criminal procedure===
Burton was deferential to the state on criminal procedure and law-and-order issues. Beginning with &quot;Betts v. Brady&quot;, 316 U.S. 455 (1942), the Supreme Court had ruled in a wide range of cases that except in cases of illiteracy, mental incapacity, or especially complicated cases, defendants did not have an absolute right to be informed of their right to counsel or to have counsel appointed for them by the state. The Court had opportunity to revisit &quot;Betts&quot; in &quot;Bute v. Illinois&quot;, 333 U.S. 640 (1948), where a felon appealed his conviction because the trial court had not advised him of his right to counsel and because the plaintiff felt he had been rushed to trial, claims he felt violated constitutional guarantees to a fair trial and due process of law. Burton wrote for a 5-to-4 majority that the Constitution did not require a state to advise a defendant about his rights to counsel, or to provide such counsel, if the crime is not a capital offense. Applying the 14th Amendment to the states in this area &quot;would disregard the basic and historic power of the states to prescribe their own local court procedures,&quot; Burton wrote. Yet, &quot;Bute&quot; was notable for carving out a capital-case exemption to &quot;Betts&quot;. Much criticized at the time for being inconsistent with &quot;Betts&quot;, the &quot;Bute&quot; decision unintentionally established grounds for the Supreme Court to whittle away at &quot;Betts&quot;, so that by 1962 some legal scholars were already arguing the Court had effectively overruled &quot;Betts&quot;. &quot;Betts&quot; and &quot;Bute&quot; were unanimously overruled in &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;, 372 U.S. 335 (1963).

Another case decided the same year as &quot;Bute&quot; illustrates Burton&#x27;s reliance on personal views as a guide to court action. Gilbert Thiel suffered a mental breakdown and leapt from a moving Southern Pacific Railroad passenger car, severely injuring himself. Thiel argued that railway personnel should have stopped him. The trial court blocked hourly-wage workers from being selected for the jury, which Thiel alleged biased the jury against him. Burton was powerfully motivated by a need to protect the Supreme Court&#x27;s reputation, which he felt would be sullied if it approved such a distasteful practice. The majority in &quot;Thiel v. Southern Pacific Co.&quot;, 328 U.S. 217 (1946), narrowed its opinion to address only the facts regarding jury selection, and therefore did not decide whether the jury actually was biased against Thiel. This helped to win Burton&#x27;s approval as well.

Burton&#x27;s belief that criminal procedure should be left to the states influenced his views in other cases as well. In &quot;Griffin v. Illinois&quot;, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), a majority held that an indigent criminal defendant could not be denied transcripts of the trial. Burton wrote a dissent, joined by justices Minton, Harlan, and Reed, in which he strongly defended the federal nature of criminal procedure. Burton also wrote a stinging dissent in &quot;Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber&quot;, 329 U.S. 459 (1947). The state of Louisiana attempted to execute convicted murderer Willie Francis on May 3, 1946, but the employee and assistant were both drunk while setting up the electric chair, and Francis did not die. The state sought to execute him again, but Francis claimed this violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The state&#x27;s failure to execute Francis the first time should mark the end of the attempt, Burton wrote. Additional attempts constituted cruel and unusual punishment: &quot;It is unthinkable that any state legislature in modern times would enact a statute expressly authorizing capital punishment by repeated applications of an electric current separated by intervals of days or hours until finally death shall result.&quot; It was an opinion that showed &quot;considerable foresight&quot; regarding the Supreme Court&#x27;s future capital punishment jurisprudence.

===Antitrust===
Burton&#x27;s greatest contribution to Supreme Court jurisprudence came in the area of antitrust law. In &quot;American Tobacco Co. v. United States&quot;, 328 U.S. 781 (1946), Burton wrote for a near-unanimous court (Justice Rutledge had written a separate concurrence) that the Sherman Antitrust Act barred the mere existence of combinations or conspiracies which created monopolistic or oligopolistic market power, regardless of whether that power was actually used. Legal scholar Eugene V. Rostow declared Burton&#x27;s decision would usher in a new era of swift, effective antitrust enforcement. But Burton&#x27;s analysis cut both ways. In &quot;United States v. Columbia Steel Company&quot;, 334 U.S. 495 (1948), the same reasoning was used to allow U.S. Steel to buy out the much smaller Columbia Steel. Even though Columbia Steel was the largest steel manufacturer on the West Coast, Burton joined the majority in holding that the acquisition did not violate the Clayton Antitrust Act because Columbia Steel represented such a small percentage of overall American steel production. The &quot;Columbia Steel&quot; decision shocked antitrust advocates.

Yet, in &quot;Lorain Journal Co. v. United States&quot;, 342 U.S. 143 (1951), Burton wrote for a unanimous court that a monopoly could not use its power to retain its monopoly position. In that case, the &quot;Lorain Journal&quot; newspaper attempted to use its market power to prevent advertisers from placing ads with a new, competing radio station. The case became noted for extending the federal government&#x27;s antitrust power to local markets. In &quot;Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States&quot;, 345 U.S. 594 (1953), the majority held that the &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; newspaper did not violate the Sherman Antitrust Act by forcing advertisers to buy space in both its evening and morning editions. Burton (joined by Black, Douglas, and Minton) strongly dissented. The Sherman Act barred all monopolistic market power, he argued, whether it was used to create or maintain a monopoly, or whether it was used to harm the public (through monopolistic pricing) or users (as in the &quot;Times-Picayune&quot; &quot;must buy&quot; case).

Burton wrote the lone dissent in &quot;Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc.&quot;, 346 U.S. 356 (1953). A majority of the justices had disposed of the case in a &quot;per curiam&quot; decision, citing the ruling in &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot;, 259 U.S. 200 (1922). Citing extensive statistics about the farm system, broadcasting revenues, and national advertising campaigns, Burton concluded it was unreasonable to claim that major league baseball was not engaged in interstate commerce. He strongly criticized the majority for incorrectly construing &quot;Federal Baseball Club&quot;, and said the majority was wrong to assume that because the Sherman Antitrust Act did not explicitly cover baseball that baseball was intended to be exempt.

A notable exception to the broad application of antitrust law came in Burton&#x27;s dissent in &quot;United States v. E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.&quot;, 353 U.S. 586 (1957). The DuPont chemical company had purchased a substantial bloc of stock in General Motors. Subsequently, General Motors purchased most of its paints and fabrics from DuPont. A majority of the court held that this vertical integration constituted a violation of the Clayton Antitrust Act. Burton, dissenting, was highly skeptical that the Clayton Act applied to vertical integration, and strongly criticized the majority&#x27;s logic concerning market power. Burton found that DuPont simply didn&#x27;t have the market power the majority claimed it did. The dissent drew widespread praise from legal scholars.

===Racial segregation===
Burton&#x27;s other major contribution to Supreme Court jurisprudence came in the area of racial segregation. Burton had been a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People from 1941 to 1945, and was a dependable vote for civil rights on the high court. One of the exceptions was his first civil rights case on the Court, &quot;Morgan v. Virginia&quot;, 328 U.S. 373 (1946). Burton was the lone dissenter in the case, which involved the racial segregation of interstate buses with curtains. Burton argued that, in the absence of a federal statute, each state should be free to establish its own laws on racial segregation.

After his vote in &quot;Morgan&quot;, Court observers believed that Burton could not be counted on to vote to expand or protect civil rights. It surprised legal analysts, then, when Burton joined the unanimous majority in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;, 334 US 1 (1948), a landmark case that held courts could not enforce racially-restrictive real estate covenants.

In a string of votes over the next three years, Burton voted to undermine the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, 163 U.S. 537 (1896). He joined the unanimous majority in &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;, 339 U.S. 629, in 1950, which held that &quot;separate but equal&quot; professional legal education was unconstitutional. Heman Marion Sweatt, an African American man, was refused admission to the all-white University of Texas School of Law. One of the first cases to find that &quot;separate but equal&quot; was not equal, the case deeply influenced the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; four years later. During the &quot;Sweatt&quot; deliberations, Burton came to the conclusion that &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; should be reversed. He informed the other justices about his conclusion the during post-oral argument conference on &quot;Sweatt&quot;. The same year, Burton joined the unanimous majority in &quot;McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents&quot;, 339 U.S. 637, which racially desegregated all graduate schools in the United States on essentially the same grounds as &quot;Sweatt&quot;. Burton subsequently wrote the unanimous majority opinion in &quot;Henderson v. United States&quot;, 339 U.S. 816 (1950). The case involved interstate travel on a passenger train. Henderson, an African-American federal worker, held a ticket that cost the same and allegedly provided the same level of service as a ticket sold to a white passenger. Nevertheless, Henderson was denied seating in the dining car after attendants seated white passengers at the tables reserved for blacks. Although the &quot;Sweatt&quot; and &quot;McLaurin&quot; courts had ruled on constitutional grounds, Burton hesitated to do so if there were procedural or technical grounds available. In &quot;Henderson&quot;, Burton was able to form a unanimous majority by basing his decision on the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, rather than the 14th Amendment.

By 1953, Burton&#x27;s thinking on racial segregation had evolved to embrace a constitutional attack on &quot;Plessy&quot;. That year, the Supreme Court took up &quot;Terry v. Adams&quot;, 345 U.S. 461, a case in which a whites-only private political club dominated the local Democratic primary election in an electoral district where Republicans were not competitive. This system served to disenfranchise black voters. The federal district and appellate courts had upheld the constitutionality of the system, persuaded that the club was purely private and thus no state action was involved. At the first post-oral argument conference held by the justices, Burton was adamant that the Supreme Court reverse and declare the practice unconstitutional. The justices took a widely varying approach to the case. The opinion of the Court was authored by Hugo Black, and joined only by Burton and Douglas. Frankfurter, personally at odds with Black, authored a separate opinion agreeing with Black&#x27;s, but which he refused to have listed as &quot;concurring&quot;. Clark authored a concurrence, which was joined by Vinson, Reed, and Jackson. Surprisingly, Burton joined Black in declaring the whites-only club in violation of the 15th Amendment. Black won over all but one justice (Minton) by agreeing to remand the case to the district court for a solution, but not specifying what that solution should be.

====Role in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;====
Burton played a crucial role in the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot;, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). Several cases alleging unconstitutional racial discrimination in elementary and secondary public schools were coming before the court in 1952. In the first sign that Burton was ready to reverse &quot;Plessy&quot;, on June 7 he voted with Clark and Minton to grant certiorari to both &quot;Brown&quot; and another case, &quot;Briggs v. Elliott&quot;, 342 U.S. 350 (1952). The Supreme Court subsequently agreed to also hear &quot;Bolling v. Sharpe&quot;, 347 U.S. 497 (1954), &quot;Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot;, 103 F. Supp. 337 (1952), and &quot;Gebhart v. Belton&quot;, 91 A.2d 137 (Del. 1952). Oral argument in all five cases was heard in early December 1952. The justices held their first post-oral argument judicial conference on the cases on December 13. Burton, Black, Douglas, and Minton had all come out against racial segregation in the public schools during the conference. Clark seemed unsure, but it appeared that he could be persuaded to join the majority. Burton himself noted in his diary that he felt the court was likely to vote 6-to-3 to bar racial discrimination in schools, but not on constitutional grounds. Other justices were not so sure. William O. Douglas believed that five justices would vote to uphold &quot;Plessy&quot;: Vinson, Clark, Frankfurter, Jackson and Reed. Among these, Frankfurter and Jackson exhibited the most doubt about &quot;Plessy&quot;. Douglas even worried that a 5-to-4 decision would be reached in which schools would be given a decade or more to bring unequal African American schools up to par. Vinson was a fence-sitter of a different kind: he was deeply troubled by the effect a desegregation order would have on the nation. It was likely that, even if Vinson joined a majority in barring &quot;separate but equal&quot; in public schools, he would do so only on narrow, technical grounds—leading to a plurality decision, a fragmented court, and a ruling lacking in legal and moral weight. Frankfurter, who personally believed racial segregation to be &quot;odious&quot;, argued for the cases to be held over to the next term and reargued. A majority of the court agreed. Some hoped for changes in the political landscape that would make a decision easier, while others worried about the effect a divided opinion would have. On June 8, the Supreme Court issued its order, scheduling reargument for October 12, 1953.

Chief Justice Fred Vinson died unexpectedly of a heart attack on September 8, 1953. On September 30, President Eisenhower nominated Earl Warren, the outgoing Republican governor of California, to replace Vinson as Chief Justice. The news was not unexpected; Warren had declined a fourth term as governor on September 2, and he had long been seen as a favorite for a Supreme Court nomination. Warren&#x27;s was a recess appointment, which meant he would have to give up his seat unless the Senate confirmed him before the end of its next session. Warren was sworn in as Chief Justice on October 5. Warren&#x27;s nomination was sent to the Senate on January 11, 1954. Senator William Langer, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, kept the nomination bottled up for seven weeks in order to hold hearings on unsubstantiated charges that Warren was a Marxist and controlled by the California liquor lobby. Warren&#x27;s nomination was forwarded to the Senate on February 24 on a favorable 12-to-3 vote, and the Senate confirmed him on March 1 on a voice vote after just eight minutes of discussion.

Even before oral reargument, Warren was convinced that &quot;Plessy&quot; had to be reversed and racial discrimination in public education ended. Warren perceived Burton as a key ally in overturning &quot;Plessy&quot;. Immediately after his swearing-in ceremony, Warren worked hard to become as friendly as possible with Burton, quietly seeking him out before any of the more senior justices. (Had Warren&#x27;s actions become widely known, he would have offended court tradition and the other justices.)

Reargument in &quot;Brown&quot; and the other cases was set for early December 1953. The first post-oral reargument conference was held December 12, at which time Warren made it very clear he would join Black, Burton, Douglas, and Minton in voting to overturn &quot;Plessy&quot;. Warren believed a unanimous decision in &quot;Brown&quot; was necessary to win public acceptance for the decision. Stanley Forman Reed appeared to Warren to be the justice most comfortable with segregation and &quot;Plessy&quot;, but even Reed admitted on December 12 that what was constitutional in 1896 might not be in 1953, due to changing circumstances. Warren went to work on Reed immediately. During the lunch break on December 12, Warren invited Reed to lunch, accompanied by Burton, Black, Minton, and Douglas. The social pressure on Reed continued for the next five days, as he lunched daily with Warren, Burton, Black, and Minton. Burton wholeheartedly supported Warren&#x27;s attempt to forge a unanimous majority, and Warren accurately judged Burton to be his most valuable ally. Burton not only pushed for pragmatic solutions, which helped win over Reed, but proved to be articulate, passionate, and persuasive—which few on the Court expected. As the justices continued to debate its approach to &quot;Brown&quot; and the other cases in conferences, in memoranda, and privately among themselves, Burton worked to alleviate fears about implementation by talking freely about his experiences as mayor of Cleveland. Burton had ended racial discrimination in healthcare by hiring African American nurses to work in whites-only hospitals. This had gone relatively smoothly, and black nurses earned widespread respect among white citizens for their professionalism.

The efforts of Warren and Burton paid off. The Supreme Court handed down a unanimous decision in &quot;Brown&quot; on May 17, 1954. Pragmatically, Warren declined to overturn &quot;Plessy&quot;, but argued that it did not apply to the field of public education. Implementation of the decision was left up to district courts, at a later date.

During part of his time on the Supreme Court, Burton kept notes on all judicial conferences as well as a diary in which he documented the discussions he had with other justices. Burton&#x27;s diary has proven to be an invaluable resource in understanding how Earl Warren achieved unanimity on &quot;Brown&quot;.

===Retirement===
By June 1957, Burton began suffering from significant shaking in his hands. As the October 1957 term began, his handwriting became difficult to read, and he began taking longer afternoon naps. He was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The shaking in his left arm had become so severe by the start of 1958 that he decided to retire from the Supreme Court. He informed President Dwight D. Eisenhower of his decision in March. Worried about other domestic and international events, Eisenhower asked Burton to consider staying one more year, and make no public announcement. Burton agreed. In the meantime, arrangements were made to give Burton&#x27;s law clerks positions at the United States Department of Justice should Burton retire before the end of the October 1958 Supreme Court term.

Burton&#x27;s condition worsened, and in June 1958 he was advised by his doctors to retire. Burton informed Chief Justice Earl Warren of his decision, and Warren urged him to stay on the Court at least until September 30. A week later, Attorney General William P. Rogers met with Burton to discuss rumors that Burton was retiring. Once more, Burton reiterated his desire to leave the Court, and Rogers, too, asked him to remain until September 30. Various crises and events conspired to keep Burton from meeting with the president until July 17, at which time Burton privately informed Eisenhower of his intention to resign. (Burton had turned 70 years old on June 22, enabling him to retire at full pay.)

Eisenhower asked Burton to keep the resignation private for a time. In part, this was because Eisenhower wanted time to consider a replacement without public pressure. Additionally, Eisenhower was worried that a resignation now might create unnecessary complications for the Supreme Court, which had agreed to hear &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot;. This case concerned the Little Rock Nine, a group of African American students barred from enrolling at Little Rock Central High School by Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas. William G. Cooper and other members of the Little Rock school district board of education had alleged they could not implement the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot;, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), because of public hostility and the opposition of Governor Faubus and the state legislature. The case was clearly headed for the Supreme Court: The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas had ruled in favor of the school district, and the NAACP had appealed both to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court (which, on June 30, declined to hear the appeal until the Court of Appeals had ruled but which also had advised the Court of Appeals to rule swiftly—before the school year began).

The Supreme Court held a special summer session on September 11 and issued its decision on September 29, after which Burton informed his law clerks and the rest of the Supreme Court of his decision to retire.

Burton publicly announced his retirement from the Supreme Court on October 6, 1958. Burton publicly announced that he was suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He retired on the advice of physicians, who said the condition might improve without the stress from his Court position. His last day at the Supreme Court was October 13.

==Late life==
Following his retirement from the Supreme Court, Burton sat by designation for several years on panels of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

He died on October 28, 1964, in Washington, D.C., from complications arising from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, kidney failure, and pulmonary trouble. His remains were interred at Highland Park Cemetery in Cleveland.

==Legacy==
Cleveland&#x27;s Main Avenue Bridge was renamed in his honor in 1986.

His papers and other memorabilia are primarily in four collections. Bowdoin College has 750 items including documents concerning 47 judicial opinions. The Hiram College Archives collection holds 69 items. The Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress has 187 ft. (120,000 items) consisting mainly of correspondence and legal files. The Western Reserve Historical Society has 10 linear ft. relating mainly to his tenure as mayor of Cleveland; the collection contains correspondence, reports, speeches, proclamations, and newspaper clippings relating to routine administrative matters and topics of special interest during Burton&#x27;s mayoralty. Other papers repose at various institutions around the country, as part of other collections.

<text>Lucius Domitius Alexander (died 310), probably born in Phrygia, was vicarius of Africa when Emperor Maxentius ordered him to send his son as hostage to Rome. Alexander refused and proclaimed himself emperor in 308.

The most detailed if somewhat confusing description of the insurrection is given by Zosimus (II, 12 and 14). He reports that Maxentius sent his portrait to Africa to gain recognition as Emperor there. The troops resisted because of their loyalty to Galerius. Maxentius ordered Domitius Alexander, the vicar of Africa, to send his son to Rome to secure his loyalty. Alexander refused and was crowned Emperor by his army. The incident was probably caused by the conflict between Maxentius and his father Maximian in April 308, and Zosimos confused Galerius with Maximian in his account.

Apart from the provinces in north Africa (today&#x27;s Algeria, Tunisia and western Libya), Domitius Alexander also controlled Sardinia. At the time of his accession, he was already at an advanced age. There is evidence in an inscription (CIL viii, 22183) that Alexander and Constantine I allied themselves in opposition to Maxentius. Salama suggests that, at the latest, the pact was entered into by autumn of 310.

Maxentius sent his praetorian prefect Rufius Volusianus and a certain Zenas to quell the rebellion, and Alexander was taken prisoner and then executed by strangulation. Apparently, his troops did not offer much resistance. Maxentius retaliated with confiscations of the property of alleged supporters of Alexander. The year of the end of Alexander&#x27;s reign is subject to debate, although it was certainly in either late 309 or early 310.

<text>Shearwater Heliport , formerly known as Canadian Forces Base Shearwater and commonly referred to as CFB Shearwater and formerly named HMCS &quot;Shearwater&quot;, is a Canadian Forces facility located east southeast of Shearwater, Nova Scotia, on the eastern shore of Halifax Harbour in the Halifax Regional Municipality. Following a base rationalization program in the mid-1990s, the Canadian Forces closed CFB Shearwater as a separate Canadian Forces base and realigned the property&#x27;s various facilities into CFB Halifax.

Shearwater Heliport is operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). The primary RCAF lodger unit is 12 Wing, commonly referred to as 12 Wing Shearwater, which is headquartered at Shearwater Heliport and provides maritime helicopter operations in support of the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) from Shearwater Heliport and Maritime Forces Pacific (MARPAC) from Arundel Castle in British Columbia. 

Shearwater Jetty, the former CFB Shearwater Annex, provides dock facilities in support of Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic and MARLANT warships.

==History==
===1918–1939===
Shearwater is the second-oldest military aerodrome in Canada. In August 1918 the US Navy established Naval Air Station Halifax, or NAS Halifax, at Baker Point on the shores of Eastern Passage to conduct anti-submarine air patrols. Lieutenant Richard E. Byrd was Officer-in-Charge US Naval Air Force in Canada, with six Curtiss HS-2L flying boats operating from NAS Halifax and six from NAS Sydney. Naval air operations in Nova Scotia were intended to be taken over by the Royal Canadian Naval Air Service (RCNAS), but the war ended before the RCNAS could train sufficient personnel.

Following the end of the First World War, the United States Navy gifted its aircraft and flying facilities in Nova Scotia to the Canadian government. The six aircraft at Sydney were shipped to Halifax for storage and the buildings sold at auction. One of the five stations established by the Flying Operations Branch of the Canadian Air Board during their first season of operations in 1920 was the Dartmouth Air Station at the former NAS Halifax. Initially, the station&#x27;s primary role was overhauling the HS-2L flying boats and dispatching them by air or rail to other stations, where they formed the backbone of civil government flying operations for several years.

In addition to serving as the main repair and overhaul depot for the Air Board&#x27;s HS-2L flying boats, the Dartmouth Air Station also conducted flying operations. In most years the station flew fewer hours than the other Air Board stations, though some aerial photography operations, surveys, and exercises with the Royal Canadian Navy were carried out each year. 

Following the cancellation of part-time training for military pilots on 31 March 1922, the Air Board restructured its flying operations, merging the Flying Operations Branch into the Canadian Air Force in June. Changes to the organization of the air stations were deferred to the fall to avoid administrative issues during the flying season. On 25 November 1922 the Dartmouth Air Station was renamed CAF Unit Dartmouth and the civilian personnel were commissioned or enlisted into the Canadian Air Force. The name changed again when the Canadian Air Force was granted the &quot;royal&quot; prefix effective 13 March 1923, becoming RCAF Unit Dartmouth, then RCAF Station Dartmouth in early October. None of these changes, nor the official formation of the Royal Canadian Air Force on 1 April 1924, substantially altered the role of the station.

Though the scale of flying operations had increased substantially in 1923 and 1924, the year-round maintenance operations did not continue after the winter of 1923–24. At the end of the 1924 flying season the station was placed on &quot;care and maintenance&quot; with only a skeleton staff to maintain the buildings. The station re-opened in the late spring of 1925 to resume photographic survey operations and artillery co-operation exercises. In July 1925, retroactive to 1 April, all the RCAF&#x27;s civil operations stations were re-designated as numbered squadrons, with Dartmouth becoming No. 4 (Operations) Squadron. 

No. 4 Squadron was inactive from the end of the 1925 flying season, but re-opened the station in 1927 and flew more hours than any previous year. Operations for 1927 were mainly photographic surveys using a Canadian Vickers Varuna, but also included some early experiments in forest dusting with a Keystone Puffer. On 1 July 1927 the RCAF&#x27;s civil operations were transferred to the new Directorate of Civil Government Air Operations (CGAO), and No. 4 (Operations) Squadron again became the Dartmouth Air Station. This directorate was nominally civilian, the director reporting directly to the Deputy Minister of National Defence, but was still staffed almost entirely by attached or seconded RCAF personnel. The following year all photographic operations were re-organized as independent detachments reporting directly to CGAO headquarters, and the Dartmouth Air Station was placed on &quot;care and maintenance&quot; again at the end of the 1927 season. The facilities continued to be used by mobile photographic detachments operating into the Maritimes from the Ottawa Air Station.

In May 1932 detachments of the Ottawa Air Station were formed at Dartmouth, Shediac, and Gaspé to assist the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in combatting rum-running. On 1 November 1932 the Civil Government Air Operations directorate was merged back into the RCAF amid major budget cuts to all government flying. 

On 16 April 1934, No. 5 (Flying Boat) Squadron was officially formed at Halifax to control the five patrol detachments on the east coast (additional detachments had been formed at Sydney and Rimouski in 1933). The headquarters of No. 5 Squadron moved to Dartmouth on 1 November 1934. When the RCAF decided, in 1937, to primarily operate landplanes for the defence of the Atlantic coast, Dartmouth was one of four locations selected for construction of a land aerodrome. The station officially became RCAF Station Dartmouth again on 1 April 1938 when a station headquarters was established to control both No. 5 Squadron and No. 4 Repair Depot.

===World War II===
The station was known as RCAF Station Dartmouth through the Second World War.

====Aerodrome====
In approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as RCAF Aerodrome - Dartmouth, Nova Scotia at with a variation of 23 degrees west and elevation of . The field was listed as &quot;all hard surfaced&quot; and had four runways but only the first is readable as follows:
By January 1943 the runway information had been updated and the four runways were listed as follows:
===Post-war===
In 1948, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) took over the facility, naming it HMCS &quot;Shearwater&quot; (after the First World War sloop of the same name), also known as Royal Canadian Naval Air Station Shearwater (RCNAS Shearwater).

The combined land and sea-based aerodromes were used to station carrier-based maritime patrol and fighter aircraft. Shearwater was also the home to early experiments with ship-borne helicopters—something which was copied by navies around the world. During the 1960s, the aerodrome at the former RCAF Station Debert was attached to HMCS &quot;Shearwater&quot; as a training location for carrier landings.

The February 1, 1968 unification of the three service branches into the Canadian Forces saw HMCS &quot;Shearwater&quot; change its name to Canadian Forces Base Shearwater (CFB Shearwater).

Base rationalization and defence budget cutbacks for the Canadian Forces during the mid-1990s saw a largely administrative move when the formation CFB Shearwater stood down and the facilities transferred to the formation CFB Halifax and aircraft operations becoming the responsibility of newly formed 12 Wing. 12 Wing is headquartered at Shearwater and reports to 1 Canadian Air Division.

==Heliport conversion project==
During the late 1990s and early 2000s the Shearwater airfield was scaled back significantly as the facility transitioned to a heliport with surplus lands identified and transferred to Canada Lands Company. Prior to 2002, Shearwater had two asphalt runways:

By 2002 only runway 10/28 remained open. As part of the Department of National Defence&#x27;s Shearwater Heliport Conversion Project, runway 10H/28H was reduced in length to the east end only in July 2007. At the same time, runway 16H/34H was reopened, but for helicopter operations only.

These changes allowed for heliport operations including instrument approaches and were accompanied with the construction of other non-airfield facilities in support of the Maritime Helicopter Project. Shearwater Heliport opened July 31, 2008, consisting of a new 16H/34H and various helipads for helicopter operations only.

As part of the heliport conversion project, the old runway 16/34 was permanently closed and placed outside (east) of a new fence for the Shearwater Heliport, as shown in the Canada Flight Supplement effective 31 July 2008. This land for the old runway 16/34 was then transferred by the Department of National Defence to the Canada Lands Company for sale. On 3 April 2009 the land for the old runway 16/34 was re-transferred from Canada Lands Company back to DND, however its future use is unknown.

Shearwater Heliport&#x27;s primary mission remains as a heliport in support of the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s Maritime Forces Atlantic warships with shipborne helicopters operated by 12 Wing, a unit of the Royal Canadian Air Force.

12 Wing&#x27;s squadrons at Shearwater Heliport in Nova Scotia and at Arundel Castle in British Columbia operate the Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone. There are numerous construction projects ongoing at Shearwater Heliport in support of the Maritime Helicopter Project, including the Maritime Helicopter Training Centre where No. 406 Squadron will be located, as well as a new No.423 (MH) Squadron hangar facility, a new 12 Air Maintenance Squadron facility with six repair bays, and a new Operational Support Facility where the Helicopter Operational Test and Evaluation Facility (HOTEF) and various 12 Wing headquarter functions will be located.

==Current operations==
Current operations at Shearwater are administratively and operationally part of CFB Halifax and revolve around two functionally separate facilities:

* Shearwater Heliport - heliport and related infrastructure largely supports the operations of 12 Wing, a unit of the RCAF which provides maritime helicopter services to the Royal Canadian Navy; and
* Shearwater Jetty - docks and shore-based infrastructure largely supports the fleet operations of Maritime Forces Atlantic and function as the home to Fleet Diving Unit Atlantic (FDU-A), as well as providing secure docking facilities (isolated from downtown Halifax) for visiting NATO warships including nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers.
* adjunct facilities formerly aligned with CFB Shearwater such as the Hartlen Point Golf Course are now attached to CFB Halifax
*Regional Cadet Support Unit (Atlantic) is also based at Shearwater.

===12 Wing===
The Shearwater Heliport is the location of the headquarters of 12 Wing, whose sole purpose is to support and operate shipborne helicopters for the Royal Canadian Navy. 12 Wing is a RCAF unit and reports to 1 Canadian Air Division.

12 Wing operates out of two locations with four squadrons:

* Shearwater Heliport
**406 Maritime Operational Training Squadron is an operational training squadron for training all maritime helicopter aircrew in the Canadian Forces.
**423 Maritime Helicopter Squadron is an operational squadron at Shearwater Heliport which provides CH-148 Cyclone helicopters for Maritime Forces Atlantic warships.
**12 Air Maintenance Squadron provides aircraft maintenance and engineering support to 12 Wing&#x27;s operational squadrons.
**Helicopter Operational and Test Evaluation Facility (HOTEF) is responsible for researching and testing state-of-the-art equipment to help enable crews to operate efficiently, ashore or while deployed.
* Arundel Castle
** 443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron is an operational squadron which operates CH-148 Cyclone helicopters for Maritime Forces Pacific warships.

==Air shows==
Beginning in the 1970s, CFB Shearwater began hosting an Armed Forces Day every fall, typically on the weekend following Labour Day, and included an air show where the long and wide runways at Shearwater hosted some of the largest aircraft in the world, including the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s C-5 Galaxy transport planes and B-52 Stratofortress bombers.

By the 1980s this air show came to be named the &quot;Shearwater International Air Show&quot; and was a popular event for military aviation enthusiasts in Eastern Canada and the Northeastern United States as the location of CFB Shearwater, coupled with the popularity of the Halifax area among military aircrew, resulted in heavy international participation from the RCAF, as well as the USAF, United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, Royal Air Force and numerous other NATO air forces in Europe.

Defence cutbacks and unit and facility realignments from 1994 to 1996 saw CFB Shearwater stand down as a separate formation and the facility merged as an airfield attached to CFB Halifax. At this time, the military-organized &quot;Shearwater International Air Show&quot; was transferred to a civilian organization that saw the event renamed to the &quot;Nova Scotia International Air Show.&quot;

Organizers of the &quot;Nova Scotia International Air Show&quot; continued to make use the Shearwater airfield for both ground displays and the air show component until 2002. Modifications to the airfield from 2002 onward as part of the Shearwater Heliport Conversion Project saw runways closed, eliminating the ability of fixed-wing aircraft to land at Shearwater, forcing the airshow to remove the static (ground) display component of the event, with the air show component continuing to be staged in the skies over Shearwater (using the nearby Halifax Stanfield International Airport as the fixed-wing airfield).

The inconvenience of not having a ground component for the &quot;Nova Scotia International Air Show&quot; as a result of the Shearwater Heliport Conversion Project saw the entire event moved to Halifax Stanfield International Airport beginning in 2004. From 2004 to 2008 the show was held at Halifax Stanfield International Airport which allowed for both static (ground) display and air show at the same venue, however the airport was deemed unsuitable due to numerous interruptions in the air show component by civilian air traffic movements.

The air show moved to Yarmouth Airport in 2009 but returned to Shearwater in 2010, the first time since 2003 that an air show was held at the historic airfield (but again with no ground component). In 2011 the air show was renamed the &quot;Atlantic Canada International Airshow&quot; and was held at the Summerside Airport, formerly CFB Summerside, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of that base. Organizers have stated that the &quot;Atlantic Canada International Air Show&quot; will likely rotate through the Shearwater airfield every second year.

==Accidents and incidents==
*31 May 1957: An RCN McDonnell F2H-3 Banshee, BuNo &quot;126313&quot;, Sqn. No. 104 of VF-870, spiraled out of control after its right wing broke in half during a high-speed flyby. The canopy was observed to separate from the aircraft, but the pilot did not eject and was killed when the plane slammed into McNabs Island. The crash was attributed to improperly manufactured fittings in the folding wing mechanism, and most RCN and US Navy Banshees were grounded until improved fittings could be installed.
*27 August 1957: An RCN F2H-3 Banshee, BuNo &quot;126306&quot;, Sqn. No. 103 of VF-870, was performing touch-and-go landings on runway 16 when it collided with an RCN General Motors TBM-3E Avenger, BuNo &quot;53358&quot;, of squadron VC-921, that was taking off from intersecting runway 20. The pilots of both aircraft were killed. Due to an inoperable radio, the Banshee pilot did not hear instructions from the control tower to go around, and apparently did not see red flares launched from the control tower due to patchy fog over the airfield and a possible lack of situational awareness.
* 25 October 1960: An RCN F2H-3 Banshee, BuNo &quot;126415&quot;, struck a portable practice landing mirror and tow truck that had been left on runway 16R after an earlier CS2F Tracker landing exercise was postponed due to rain. Two VF-870 Banshees were subsequently cleared for a formation landing and continuing rain prevented the pilots from seeing the unlit mirror in time to take evasive action; one aircraft struck the mirror at high speed, shearing off the left-hand wingtip and auxiliary wingtip fuel tank, demolishing the mirror, and damaging the tow truck. The pilot was able to maintain directional control and stop the Banshee on the runway, but the impact caused irreparable internal damage to the airframe, and the aircraft was written off. The incident is attributed to the failure of Shearwater air traffic controllers to alert the pilots that the mirror was parked on the runway.

<text>The Eagle Talon is a sport compact hatchback coupé manufactured as part of a joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi in two generations starting from the 1989 model year. 

The cars were marketed by Eagle as well as rebadged variants, the Plymouth Laser and Mitsubishi Eclipse.

The last model year for the Eagle Talon, as well as the Eagle division of Chrysler, was 1998.

==Characteristics==
The Talon, Laser and Eclipse were badge variants using the Chrysler D platform, manufactured at the DSM (Diamond Star Motors joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi) manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois. All three vehicles were mechanically identical (when comparing the same option level) including engine, transmission, and drivetrain.

Cosmetically, differences between the three were found in wheels, availability of colors, taillights, front and rear bumpers, and spoilers. The Talon featured a two-tone body color with a black &#x27;greenhouse&#x27; (roof, pillars, door-mounted mirrors) regardless of the body color. Available transmissions were a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. A hood bulge on the left-hand side of the car was needed for camshaft clearance when equipped with the &quot;4G63&quot; engine. All versions featured this hood design including the base DL model.

==First generation (1990)==
The first-generation Talon was released in mid-1989 as a 1990 model and continued through 1994. This era of DSM vehicles is referred to as the first-generation, or &quot;1G&quot;. However, there were two 1G styles. The 1990 and 1991 &quot;1GA&quot; models featured pop-up headlights and a &quot;6-bolt&quot; engine, while the 1992 through 1994 &quot;1GB&quot; models featured exposed composite-style headlights with integrated turn signals and a &quot;7-bolt&quot; engine.

The 1993 and 1994 base model DL was front-wheel drive and included a 1.8 L engine (&quot;4G37&quot;). The ES model (or just the base Talon before 1993) included a naturally aspirated 2.0  L Mitsubishi 4G63 engine. The TSi and TSi AWD models used the same engine but added an intercooled Mitsubishi &quot;14b&quot; turbocharger producing , rated at on TSi AWD models. The front-drive TSi model was rated at due to a restrictive exhaust system, and the automatic transmission versions were rated at due to a 13g turbo. The 1990 turbo models were only available with a five-speed manual transmission. 

All 1G Talons(and DSMs) built after VIN xxxxxxxxNE005602 or from May 1992, received a freer revving &quot;7-bolt&quot; bottom-end engine that was also used in the new 1992 Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. The engine included lighter rods, a 7-bolt lighter crankshaft, as well as a larger one-piece crankshaft girdle and bracing.

===1G trim levels===
*Eagle Talon base – 1990–1992
*&quot;TSi FWD Turbo&quot; – 1990–1994
*&quot;TSi AWD Turbo&quot; – 1990–1994
*&quot;DL&quot; – 1993–1994
*&quot;ES&quot; – 1993–1994

===Production numbers===
* 1990: 32,708
* 1991: 33,537
* 1992: 27,945
* 1993: 26,740
* 1994: 24,040

===Awards===
The Eagle Talon TSi and TSi AWD were on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s 10 Best list for 1990, 1991 and 1992.
Talon models also shared the &quot;10 Best&quot; designation with the other Mitsubishi versions from 1989 through 1992.

==Second generation (1995)==
The second-generation (or &quot;2G&quot;) Eagle Talon was introduced in 1995 simultaneously with its Mitsubishi Eclipse counterpart, while the Plymouth Laser version was discontinued. Mechanically, the new Talon and Eclipse models were almost identical to the engines in the turbocharged versions with an increase in output due to a redesigned intake and exhaust, higher 8.5:1 (vs. 7.8:1) compression pistons, and new turbocharger. The new T25 turbocharger, sourced from Garrett, had a boost increase to of peak boost and was smaller than the previous Mitsubishi built 14b turbo that was on 1G models. The T25 spooled up faster than the previous turbocharger to increase the turbo response or reduce turbo lag. 

While the 1G had MacPherson struts in the front, the 2G had double-wishbone in the front and multilink suspension in the rear. The double-wishbone suspension improved the roll-camber curve in the front for better handling.

The differences between the Eagle Talon and its Mitsubishi equivalent were more substantial than in the first-generation models. The rear fascia of the Talon featured a bumper cap with a dip in the middle to allow for a high-mounted rear license plate; rear light clusters incorporating amber turn signals (the Eclipse used red turn signals); reverse lights as part of the main rear tail light clusters (the Eclipse&#x27;s reverse lights were mounted separately and lower around the mid-mounted license plate); and a sickle-shaped rear spoiler for the TSi and TSi AWD version mounted at the base of the rear window that was painted black regardless of body color (the Eclipse used a body-colored, conventional &quot;basket handle&quot; spoiler mounted on the rear deck). ESi models (non-turbo) did not receive side skirts, while TSi and TSi AWD models received side skirts that had the words &quot;16V DOHC TURBO&quot; embossed on the sections behind the doors and ahead of the rear wheels. Minor differences in the front bumper included the lack of a body-colored splitter in the central air intake compared to the Eclipse, slightly differently shaped fog lamps, and the entire air intake section was recessed into the bumper cover compared to the flush intakes of the Eclipse. The Talon featured a black roof while the Eclipse had a body-colored top. Lastly, the &quot;Eagle&quot; and either &quot;ESi&quot;, &quot;TSi&quot;, or &quot;TSi AWD&quot; badges were embossed, body-colored plastic that was glued to the rear bumper below the taillights on the Talon, while the Eclipse used simple stickers placed on the hatch to denote make and trim level.

For the 1997 model year, a design update occurred for both the Talon and the Eclipse that is sometimes referred to as &quot;2Gb&quot;. The front and rear fascias were heavily revised to incorporate more aggressive-looking features. At the front, a larger air intake was created and the &quot;Eagle&quot; emblem was enlarged and embossed into the center of the bumper cap (as opposed to a badge that inset into a similarly shaped hole). A new high-mount spoiler replacing the previous flush-mounted &quot;sickle&quot; spoiler. Side skirts were dropped from TSi and TSi AWD models. Embossed lettering &quot;16V DOHC TURBO&quot; was added between the doors and rear wheels. All badging on the sides and rear of the car was now changed to contrasting colors instead of body-colored. Plastic moldings on the bumper caps and doors were added. The TSi and TSi AWD models&#x27; aluminum wheels were increased to and the styling was angular replacing the curved design of the wheel&#x27;s five-spokes.

The TSi and TSi AWD models again featured an intercooled turbocharged engine, now replacing the 14B Mitsubishi turbo with a Garrett &quot;T25&quot; model. Although the &quot;T25&quot; was a smaller turbo, it spooled faster at a lower rpm resulting in increased low-end acceleration performance. The TSi AWD model retained the all-wheel drive drivetrain.

===Discontinuation===
By 1998, the Talon was the last model in the declining Eagle lineup and the rarest Talon model year. Amid declining sales, Chrysler management decided to stop promoting the Eagle brand. The last Eagle Talon rolled off the assembly line on February 10, 1998.

==Eagle Jazz==
In 1994, a concept car called the &quot;Eagle Jazz&quot; was developed for the 1995 automobile show circuit. &quot;It was a sporty sedan with a rounded hatchback tail. Built into that was a hatch-within-a-hatch, so a driver could easily open the rear end to store cargo.&quot; It was considered by some to have &quot;a strange resemblance to a 4-door Eagle Talon&quot;. Some of the Eagle Jazz concept designs and ideas resurfaced in the second-generation Chrysler Concorde.

==Motorsport==
The Talon won the SCCA World Challenge touring car championship from 1990 until 1991 and the GT Touring championship from 1993 through 1995. Along with Oldsmobile (Achieva 1992–1994), Eagle is one of only two American brands to win the TC championship in the 1990s. As of 2020, GM&#x27;s Oldsmobile Achieva and Chevy Sonic (TCB) have accomplished this feat, along with Chrysler&#x27;s Eagle Talon. The Dodge Shelby Charger won SSA of the predecessor SCCA / Escort Endurance Championship in 1986, and its Eagle Talon TSI AWD won SSA in 1989.
*1989 - AWD Turbo - Escort Endurance Class A Championship for co-drivers Bobby &amp; Tommy Archer
*1990 - FWD Turbo - Escort World Challenge Super Production Class Championship for driver Bobby Archer
*1991 - FWD Non-Turbo - Escort World Challenge Super Production Class Championship for driver Mitch Wright 
*1992 - FWD Non-Turbo - Escort World Challenge Class D Championship for driver Neil Hanneman
*1993 - FWD Turbo - Escort World Challenge Class B Championship for driver Willy Lewis
*7 straight SCCA Pro Racing Championships - Eagle Talon HKS &amp; Archer Racing dominated

==The TSi name==
Before the introduction of the Talon, the TSi (Turbo Sport Intercooled) nameplate was used on the 1986 through 1989 Mitsubishi Starion wide-body versions that were marketed as Dodge, Plymouth, or Chrysler &quot;Conquest&quot; model.

The TSi nameplate was used on a version of the Jeep Grand Cherokee (ZJ) during 1997 and 1998. Marketed as a sportier model, the TSi featured a monochromatic paint scheme with indigo-blue accented trim, a styling feature that was previously available on the Talon. 

The TSi name reappeared, as a high-performance model for the Chrysler Sebring sedan, for the 2005 and 2006 model years.

<text>Markowa is a village in Łańcut County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in south-eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Markowa. It lies approximately south-east of Łańcut and east of the regional capital Rzeszów.

==History==
The village was founded in the 14th century by the Polish noble family of Pilecki, and was settled by the descendants of German colonists, who called it &quot;Markhof&quot;. The Pileckis also founded a Catholic parish in the village.
During World War II it was under German occupation.

On 24 March 1944 a patrol of German police came to the house of Józef and Wiktoria Ulma, where they found eight Jewish members of the Szall and Goldman families. At first the Germans executed all the Jews. Then they shot the pregnant Wiktoria and her husband. When the six children began to scream at the sight of their parents&#x27; bodies, Joseph Kokott, a German police officer (Volksdeutsche from Koblov in Hlučín Region), shot them after consulting with his superior. The other killers were Eilert Dieken, Michael Dziewulski and Erich Wilde. Afterwards the Germans robbed the house and workshop of the Ulma family and organized an alcoholic libation. On the 60th anniversary of this tragedy, a memorial was erected in memory of the family. The family was beatified by the Catholic Church, with the ceremony taking place in Markowa on 10 September 2023 by papal delegate Cardinal Marcello Semeraro. Other Polish families also hid Jews in Markowa, and at least 17 Jews survived the German occupation and the Holocaust in five Polish homes.

The Markowa Ulma-Family Museum of Poles Who Saved Jews in World War II is located in the village.

However, memory of the tragedy in Markowa has been politically used to support a view that can be summed up as follows: Since Poles saved Jews, it cannot be that Poles murdered Jews or handed them over to the Germans. Memory of the tragedy is used to portray wartime Poland as a &quot;Republic of the Just&quot; of a heroic people.

<doc id="549631" wikidata="Q2039285" url="?curid=549631" title="Arthur Rowley">
<text>George Arthur Rowley Jr. (21 April 1926 – 19 December 2002), nicknamed &quot;The Gunner&quot; because of his explosive left-foot shot, was an English football player and cricketer. He holds the record for the most goals in the history of English league football, scoring 434 from 619 league games. He was the younger brother of Manchester United footballer Jack Rowley. He was shortlisted for inclusion into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2008.

He holds the club record for the most goals in a single season at both Leicester City and Shrewsbury Town, scoring 44 goals in 42 league matches at Leicester in 1956–57 and 38 goals in 43 games for Shrewsbury in 1958–59. He is also Shrewsbury&#x27;s record league goalscorer with 152 league goals. He is Leicester&#x27;s second all-time top goalscorer, netting 265 times for the Foxes, 8 goals short of Arthur Chandler&#x27;s record.

==Early life==
George Arthur Rowley was the third son of Mark Rowley, a well known goalkeeper playing semi-professionally in the Birmingham League. Born in Wolverhampton where he was educated at Dudley Road School and later at St Peter&#x27;s Collegiate School, he started his career originally as a centre-half before moving up front where his prowess in the forward line won him an early selection into the school&#x27;s first team. He went on to win local honours with Wolverhampton and County honours with both Birmingham and Staffordshire. He was selected for England schoolboys but the outbreak of the war robbed him of the opportunity.

==Playing career==
===Manchester United===
On leaving school in 1940, Rowley went to work for a sheet metal firm doing war work before joining his older brother Jack in Manchester. Thus Rowley began his career at Manchester United, signing as an Amateur just four days after his 15th birthday. The following day, 26 April 1941, at 15 years and 5 days old, he became the youngest ever player to feature in the Manchester United first team when he lined up alongside Jack in a war-time league match against Liverpool at Anfield.

Rowley went on to play seven times for the United first team before being released in May 1944.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Rowley also played regularly as an amateur at Wolverhampton Wanderers as guest during the war, before turning professional with West Bromwich Albion later in the summer of 1944. However, he struggled at The Hawthorns both to score goals and gain a regular place in the first team.

===Fulham===
Albion sold Rowley early in the 1948–49 season to Fulham, where he immediately found his goal-scoring touch, scoring 19 goals in 22 appearances as he helped the side to the Second Division title.

Rowley failed to recapture his form in the First Division as he scored only 7 goals.

===Leicester City===
At the end of his first season in the top flight he was sold to Leicester City. There was much criticism from Leicester fans originally towards manager Norman Bullock on signing the relatively unproven Rowley as a replacement for the well-liked Jack Lee. However, after a slow start as a centre forward, Bullock moved Rowley into the &quot;number 10&quot; inside left role which is where he would make his name at the Foxes, on 23 September, in which Rowley scored Leicester&#x27;s consolation goal in a 2–1 defeat to Coventry City.&quot; By the end of his debut season, his 28 goals had appeased the crowd, though the club still finished in a disappointing 14th position.

It was in his second season that Rowley began to make a name for himself as he broke Arthur Chandler&#x27;s club record for the most goals in a season, netting 38 times. He then broke his own record again the following season, scoring 41 times in 42 games, 39 of these goals coming in the league, earning him the Second Division golden boot award. He scored a further 36 goals in the 1953–54 season helping fire Leicester to the Second Division title.

However, Leicester lasted just one season in the First Division as they were relegated back to the second tier at the first attempt. A couple of seasons later, in 1956–57, Rowley broke the club record for the most goals in a season for the third time, scoring 44 times in 42 games (this record still stands today), again earning him the Second Division top goalscorer award and again leading Leicester to the Second Division title. Rowley scored a further 20 times in 25 games in 1957–58 to help Leicester this time avoid relegation back to the second tier.

However Dave Halliday decided to sell Rowley in the summer of 1958 when he was just 8 goals short of Arthur Chandler&#x27;s club record for the all-time top goalscorer. This led to a loss of faith by the fans and ultimately his sacking 2 months into the 1958–59 season.

In his 8 seasons at Filbert Street overall, Rowley scored 265 goals in 321 games, including 16 hat-tricks.

===Shrewsbury Town===
In the summer of 1958 Rowley left Leicester, who were playing in the First Division, to become the player-manager of Shrewsbury Town of the newly created Fourth Division. In his first season at the Gay Meadow Rowley led Shrewsbury to promotion with a haul of 38 goals in 43 games, winning the Fourth Division golden boot. He followed that up in the Third Division as he continued scoring prolifically, netting 32, 28, 23 and 24 times over the next four seasons, before falling away in his last couple of seasons with the club as he began to put on weight and became less mobile, but his influence on the pitch was still to be seen, even employing himself as a makeshift defender on occasion, before finally retiring in 1965.

==Management career==
===Sheffield United===
After retiring as a player Rowley managed Shrewsbury for another four years before becoming manager of Sheffield United on 11 July 1968. United had just been relegated to Division Two but despite good signings who would later gain the team promotion, results were disappointing and he was sacked on 6 August 1969.

He managed Southend United from 1970 to 1976 and was also assistant manager of Telford United and manager of non-league Knighton Town and Oswestry Town before leaving football.

==Cricketing career==
Rowley represented Shropshire in three Minor Counties Championship matches between 1961 and 1962 as a right-handed batsman and a leg break bowler, and played at club level for Rolls-Royce in Shrewsbury.

==Later life==
Rowley made his home in the suburb of Copthorne, Shrewsbury. He continued to visit the Gay Meadow as a spectator. In 2000, he was voted by Shrewsbury Town their &#x27;player of the century&#x27;. He died in December 2002 aged 76 and was buried on Saturday 26 December (Boxing Day) in Shrewsbury General Cemetery in Longden Road. His headstone, in Plot 18, describes him as a &quot;record breaking football hero&quot;.

==Honours==

*Second Division champions: 1948–49

Leicester City
*Second Division champions: 1953–54, 1956–57

<text>Karaman is a city in south central Turkey, located in Central Anatolia, north of the Taurus Mountains, about south of Konya. It is the seat of Karaman Province and Karaman District. Its population is 175,390 (2022). The town lies at an average elevation of . The Karaman Museum is one of the major sights.
==Etymology==
The town owes its name to Karaman Bey, who was one of the rulers of the Karamanid dynasty. The former name &quot;Laranda&quot; which in turn comes from the Luwian language &quot;Larawanda&quot;, literally means &quot;sandy, a sandy place&quot;.

==History==

In ancient times, Karaman was known as Lānda in Hittite and Laranda (). In the 6th century BC it came under Achaemenid rule until 322 BC, when it was destroyed by Perdiccas, a former general of Alexander the Great, after he had defeated Ariarathes I, king of Cappadocia.
It later became a seat of Isaurian pirates. At some point it was possessed by Antipater of Derbe.
It belonged to the Roman and later Byzantine Empires until it was captured by the Seljuks in the early 12th century. Karaman was occupied by Frederick Barbarossa in 1190 and by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia between 1211 and 1216. In 1256, the town was taken by Karaman Bey and was renamed Karaman in his honour. From 1275, Karaman was the capital of the Karamanid beylik.

In 1468 the Karamanids were conquered by the Ottomans and in 1483 the capital of the province was moved to Konya. Karaman has retained ruins of a Karamanid castle and some walls, two mosques and a Koran school (&quot;madrasah&quot;) from that age. A mihrab from a mosque from Karaman can now be found in the Çinili Pavilion near the Archeology Museum in Istanbul.
The Karamanslis were Cappadocian Turkomans who fought the Ottomans. Later they integrated into the empire.

There was a Roman Catholic titular see for the city.
The poet Yunus Emre () resided in Karaman during his later years and is believed to lie buried beside the Yunus Emre Mosque. A small adjacent park is adorned with quotations from his verse, many of them graffiti-splattered. In 1222, the Sufi preacher Bahaeddin Veled arrived in town with his family, and the Karamanoğlu emir built a &quot;madrasah&quot; to accommodate them. Veled&#x27;s son was the famous Rumi, who married his wife, Gevher Hatun, while his family was living in Karaman. It was here, too, that Rumi&#x27;s mother died in 1224. She was buried, along with other family members, in the Aktekke Mosque (also known as the Mader-i Mevlana Cami), which Alaeddin Ali Bey had built to replace the original &quot;madrasah&quot; in 1370.

When Thomas Jefferson fought Libya&#x27;s Barbary pirates, he replaced one member of the al-Qaramanli dynasty with another as Pasha.

<doc id="549642" wikidata="Q44724" url="?curid=549642" title="Amazonas (Colombian department)">
<text>Amazonas () is a department of Southern Colombia. It is the largest department in area while having the third smallest population among the departments. Its capital is Leticia and its name comes from the Amazon River, which drains the department.

It is made up entirely of Amazon Rainforest territory. The southern portion of the department, south of the Putumayo River, is called the &quot;Amazonian Trapeze&quot;, which includes the triple border of Colombia, Peru and Brazil, and its southern limit is the Amazon River.
== Toponymy ==
The department name comes from the name of the Amazon River. The river was named by the Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana (1511–1546), who, on his voyage of exploration, said he was attacked by &quot;fierce females&quot; who looked like Amazons of the Greek mythology; however, the existence of a female warrior tribe in that time hasn&#x27;t been demonstrated and it is possible that they were long-haired Native American warriors who impressed the conqueror, who called the jungle and the river with the name of Amazon.

== Demographics ==
The following ethnic groups are found in the department: Bora, Cocama, Macuna, Mirana, Okaina, Ticunas, Tucano, Uitoto, Yagua, and Yucuna, among others. 
These groups are more than 5,000 years old. In 2018, the population comprised 76,589 people.
== National parks ==
The Amazonas Department covers of protected area, most of it under the name of &quot;forest reserve&quot; since 1959. There are currently four &quot;National Parks&quot; (Amacayacú, Cahuinarí, Rio Puree, and Yagoje Apaporis).

<doc id="549644" wikidata="Q230223" url="?curid=549644" title="Arauca Department">
<text>Arauca () is a department of Eastern Colombia located in the extreme north of the Orinoco Basin of Colombia (the Llanos Orientales), bordering Venezuela. The southern boundary of Arauca is formed by the Casanare and Meta Rivers, separating Arauca from the departments of Casanare and Vichada. To the west, Arauca borders the department of Boyacá. The Caño Limón oil fields located within Arauca account for almost a third of the Colombian oil output. Its capital is the town of Arauca.

== Etymology ==
The name Arauca is believed to derive from the name of an Indigenous people, who are thought to be related to the Arawak or Arhuaco people. Some have also speculated that the name Arauca is connected with the Araucanian or Mapuche Indians of Chile and Argentina.

== History ==
The first conquistador to set foot in the region of present-day Arauca was Nikolaus Federmann in 1539. He was a soldier in the company of Georg von Speyer, who passed through the south of present-day Venezuela and the eastern part of what is today known as Colombia. In 1659, the Catholic missions were establishing new settlements in tribal Guahibo, U&#x27;wa, Aeric and Chirico tribal lands.

In the eighteenth century, being expelled from the Jesuits under Viceroy Pedro Mesia de la Zerda, the Augustinian Recollect succeeded in their mission of evangelization. They founded five centers of the catechism: Solitude of Cravo, Cuiloto San Javier, San Jose del Ele, Lipa San Joaquin and San Fernando de Arauca.

In 1810, the Araucanian territory became part of the newly created province of Casanare and in 1819 Arauca was incorporated into the province of Cundinamarca. By 1857, Arauca was made part of the Sovereign State of Boyacá, that later became the Boyacá department. In 1891, the Arauca police station was established with chief executive Pedro León Acosta. By decree 113 of January 20, 1955, the territory was elevated to the national quartermaster, and finally, with the Constitution of July 5, 1991, Arauca became a department. Arauca is the regional capital since 1911.

=== Political and administrative evolution ===
* 1550: The New Kingdom of Granada is officially established under the Audiencia
* 1810: With the division into new units, the Arauca territory becomes part of the province of Casanare
* 1818: Under president Fernando Serrano and Santander, General Commander of the patriotic forces, Arauca becomes provisional capital of the Republic
* 1819: The province of Casanare became part of the Department of Cundinamarca
* 1831: With the dissolution of Gran Colombia, Arauca remains part of the province of Casanare
* 1886: With the creation of the departments, Arauca becomes part of the Department of Boyacá
* 1911: Creation of the Special Commissioner of Arauca; capital of Arauca
* 1955: The Araucanian territory acquired the status of National Quartermaster
* 1960: Boyacá Arauca is created

== Geography ==
Its territory covers an area of 23,818 km2, predominantly composed of plains.

== Ethnography ==

The Colombian census does not collect data on race and ethnicity, but compiled population estimates of the five groupings are:
* Indigenous Latino (93.70%)
* Afro-Colombians (4.07%)
* Native Tribal American or Tribal Indigenous (2.22%)
* Roma (0.01%)
* Asian (0.01%)

There are small numbers of descendants of European immigrants: the Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian, French, British, Dutch, Polish, Greek and Arab (i.e. Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian) nationalities.

Many Venezuelan nationals live in the department; around 10-15 percent of the population is of Venezuelan origin.

== Indigenous population ==

The department&#x27;s total indigenous population amounts to 3591 people. Across the department 26 &quot;resguardos&quot; are located in an area of . Six indigenous groups populate this region; U&#x27;wa with 1,124 members; Betoye at 800, Sikuani number 782, 441 Hitnü are registered, Kuiba count up to 241, Hitanü are listed at 110, the Chiricoa amount to 63 and thirty Piapoco are registered in Arauca. The predominant ethnic group in the department are the U&#x27;wa. They are located in the northeastern foothills of the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes, until the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy in Boyacá. Its total population is estimated at 7231 people, belong to the Chibcha language family. U&#x27;wa means &quot;intelligent people who can speak&quot;.

The Betoye with 800 members constitutes the second-largest ethnic group in the department. They inhabit the banks of the Cravo Norte River and the municipality of Tame. The area of its territory is . Their language is considered part of the Chibcha language family. Although not retaining their original language, the people speak a mixture of Betoye with Spanish. Certain grammatical structures of the Betoye language persist in this mixture.

The Guahibo are subdivided into tribes known as Sikuani, Kuiba, Chiricoa, Hitanü (iguana) and Hitnü (Macaguane), who speak Arawakan languages.

== Economy ==
The main economical activity of Arauca is centered around the oil industry, with the Caño Limón oilfields as the most important source. The soils of the region have shown good conditions for growing cacao, bananas, cassava, rice, corn and fruit trees, as well as industrial crops such as African palmtree, sorghum, soybeans and sesame. Livestock farming is another important factor of the department&#x27;s economy.

== Municipalities ==

<text>East Williamsburg is a neighborhood in the northwestern portion of Brooklyn, New York City, United States. East Williamsburg consists roughly of what was the 3rd District of the Village of Williamsburgh and what is now called the East Williamsburg In-Place Industrial Park (EWIPIP), bounded by the neighborhoods of Northside and Southside Williamsburg to the west, Greenpoint to the north, Bushwick to the south and southeast, and both Maspeth and Ridgewood in Queens to the east. Much of this area is still referred to as either Bushwick, Williamsburg, or Greenpoint with the term East Williamsburg falling out of use since the 1990s.

== History ==
In the 18th century, Bushwick was already an established town, and the waterfront area that provided ferry service to the island of Manhattan was simply known as Bushwick Shore. The land of scrub bush that stood between Bushwick Shore and the town of Bushwick was known as Cripplebush. During the Revolutionary War occupation of the area by the British, the land was cleared, with the wood of the thickets being used for fuel. In 1800, Richard M. Woodhull purchased the waterfront property and laid out a settlement, naming it Williamsburgh after his friend and surveyor Colonel Jonathan Williams. Williamsburgh was incorporated as a village in 1827 (as a part of the town of Bushwick), and included 26 streets running East to West and 12 streets east of the shore line running North to South.

On April 18, 1835, the village of Williamsburg was extended eastward to Bushwick Avenue and to Flushing Avenue on the Southeast (then known as Newtown Road). The region that is now circumscribed on the west by Union Ave, on the south by Broadway, then along Flushing Avenue to Bushwick Avenue on the east and on the north (approximately) by the Newtown Creek was designated as the Third District of the Village of Williamsburg in 1835. At this time, the three districts of Williamsburg were more commonly known as the North Side, South Side, and the New Village. The names &quot;North Side&quot; and &quot;South Side&quot; remain in common usage today, but the name for the Third District has changed often. The New Village became populated by Germans and for a time was known by the sobriquet of &quot;Dutchtown&quot;. In 1844, Williamsburg separated from the Town of Bushwick and became the Town and Village of Williamsburg. Parts of the Third District were known as &quot;Irish Town&quot; and &quot;The Green&quot; during the latter half of the 19th century.

In 1854, Williamsburg was incorporated into the City of Brooklyn, which was one of the original six Dutch Townships of western Long Island. Upon consolidation with Brooklyn in 1854, Districts one (North Side) and two (South Side) became, respectively, Wards 14 and 13 of the City of Brooklyn. The third District was split and became Wards 15 and 16 of the City of Brooklyn. Ward 15 was the section north of Ten Eyck Street, between Union Avenue and Bushwick Avenue, with the addition of the portion of Ainslie, Grand, Hope, and South Second Streets between west of Union Avenue and east of Rodney Street. Ward 16 was the section south of Ten Eyck Street, bounded by Broadway, Flushing Avenue, and Bushwick Avenue.

== Demographics ==
Based on data from the 2010 United States census, the population of East Williamsburg was 34,158, an increase of 2,280 (7.2%) from the 31,878 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 43.1% (14,706) White, 9.3% (3,189) African American, 0.1% (40) Native American, 12.7% (4,354) Asian, 0.1% (21) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (115) from other races, and 1.6% (561) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 32.7% (11,172) of the population.

As according to the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, there were between 20,000 and 29,999 White residents and 10,000 to 19,999 Hispanic residents; however, Black and Asian residents were each between 5,000 and 9,999 residents.

== Transportation ==
East Williamsburg is well served by the New York City Subway. It is mainly served by the Grand Street, Montrose Avenue, and Morgan Avenue stops of the BMT Canarsie Line (). On the border with Bedford-Stuyvesant is the Flushing Avenue stop of the BMT Jamaica Line () and the Flushing Avenue stop of the IND Crosstown Line ().

East Williamsburg is also served by the B24 bus on Kingsland and Meeker Avenues, the B57 on Flushing Avenue, the B60 on Montrose, Johnson and Morgan Avenues, the Q54 on Metropolitan Avenue and Grand Street, and the Q59 on Grand Street.

The Kosciuszko Bridge (carrying Interstate 278) and the Grand Street Bridge across the Newtown Creek connect East Williamsburg with Maspeth, Queens.

== Boundaries ==

East Williamsburg is in Brooklyn Community Board 1 and is bounded by the East River, Kent Avenue, Flushing Avenue, and the Newtown Creek.

However, various parts of the East Williamsburg are served by different post offices. The neighborhood includes the zip codes 11211, served by the Williamsburg Post Office at 263 S. 4th Street; 11206, served by the Metropolitan-Bushwick Post Office at 47 Debevoise Street; 11222, served by the Greenpoint Post Office at 66 Meserole Avenue; and 11237, served by the Wyckoff Heights-Bushwick Post Office at 86 Wyckoff Avenue.

There are several public housing projects in East Williamsburg, including the Williamsburg Houses, Borinquen Plaza Houses, Cooper Park Houses, John Francis Hylan Houses, and the Bushwick Houses.

Greenspaces include Cooper Park.

== Subsections ==

=== East Williamsburg Industrial Park ===

The eastern half of East Williamsburg, roughly bounded by the Newtown Creek on the east and by I-278 and Flushing Avenue on the north and south, respectively, is mostly zoned for industry with some residential housing mixed among the warehouses and factories. The section is currently referred to by the city as the East Williamsburg Industrial Park (EWIP), or formally the East Williamsburg In-Place Industrial Park (EWIPIP). The western boundary runs approximately along Kinsgland Ave, then Morgan Avenue and then just east of Bushwick Avenue.

The EWIP is one of eight In-Place Industrial Parks in New York City and is managed by the East Williamsburg Valley Industrial Development Corporation (EWVIDCO), a company founded in 1982 with the goal of revitalizing East Williamsburg by attracting new businesses, providing business assistance to existing firms and grow overall job opportunities in the neighborhood.

Historically, this neighborhood was not part of the Village of Williamsburgh. In the late 19th century the region east of the present-day Humboldt Street, west of the Newtown Creek, south of Meeker Avenue, and north of Metropolitan Avenue was the 18th ward of the City of Brooklyn. The north part of the EWIP is served by the Greenpoint Post Office and is considered by some to be part of Greenpoint. The portion of the EWIP to the south of Metropolitan Avenue was historically part of Bushwick and is still referred by many as being in Bushwick.

For many years a well-known landmark in East Williamsburg was a pair of cylindrical natural gas holders located on Maspeth Avenue, built in 1927 and 1948 by Brooklyn Union Gas, and demolished in 2001.

=== East of Bushwick Avenue ===
The section of Brooklyn that lies east of Bushwick Avenue, bordered by Metropolitan Avenue and Flushing Avenue on the North and South, is referred to some as being part of East Williamsburg since the region is part of EWIP. Factories and warehouses are being decommissioned due to heavy and light industry leaving the area. An example of this can be seen in the adjacent picture which shows the two loft buildings on McKibbin St., 255 McKibbin and 248 McKibbin. At present it lies within the boundaries of Community Board 1, the Brooklyn Community Board for Greenpoint and Williamsburg.

== Library ==
The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL)&#x27;s Bushwick branch is located at 340 Bushwick Avenue near Seigel Street. The Bushwick branch was founded in 1903 and its current building opened in 1908.

== Culture ==
There are several communities and neighborhoods within East Williamsburg. Since the late 19th century, most of the immigrants to this section have come from Italy or from Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries. Graham Avenue (also known as Avenue of Puerto Rico to the south of Grand Street, and Via Vespucci to the north), Grand Street, and Metropolitan Avenue are the main shopping districts. The Moore Street Market, often referred to as La Marqueta de Williamsburg, is located at 110 Moore Street.
The first wave of Italian immigration to East Williamsburg occurred in the second half of the 19th century. By the late 1880s, the neighborhood along Graham Avenue was inhabited by many Italian immigrants, as evidenced by The Our Lady of the Snow Society at 410 Graham Avenue, established in 1888. Italians also attended St. Cecilia&#x27;s Catholic Church at 84 Herbert Street, which was established in 1871 and run mainly by Irish. Other Italian societies in the neighborhood include Sabino Society on Withers St., the San Cono Society on Ainslie St. A second wave of Italian immigration occurred from World War II until the 1970s. While the neighborhood has changed significantly, the established Italian community still thrives along the north end of Graham avenue, also referred to as &quot;Via Vespucci&quot;. The neighborhood also was home to The Motion Lounge, the former nightclub at 420 Graham Avenue owned by Bonanno crime family caporegime Dominick Napolitano.

There are also many Puerto Rican residents. The south end of Graham Avenue (also known as &quot;Avenue of Puerto Rico&quot;) has been the center of a Latin American immigrant neighborhood since the 1950s.

Since the 1990s, the area has seen a great influx of young artists, professionals, students and &quot;hipsters&quot;, mainly due to its close proximity to Manhattan and major universities (e.g. Pratt Institute, New York University, School of Visual Arts, Fashion Institute of Technology, The New School) and the relatively inexpensive rent.
The rent is rising however, and the influx of said students has made housing more competitive pushing out those who cannot afford the rising cost of living in the north.

<text>Arauca is a municipality and capital city of the Arauca Department of Colombia. Its full name is Villa de Santa Bárbara de Arauca, it is located at N 07° 05′ 25″ - W 70° 45′ 42″. The Municipality of Arauca has a total population of 85,585 (2018 census).

==History==
The Arauca region was explored by the German conquistador Jorge de la Espira, or Georg von Speyer, in 1536. The early Spanish did not stay because they were on the quest for El Dorado. However, they were later followed by Jesuits and land-grantees who founded the first settlements.

Arauca was founded on December 4, 1780, by Juan Isidro Daboín on the site of an indigenous hamlet of about ten families called Guahibo. Arauca was named after the Arauca River, which now separates it from Venezuela, which river in turn was named for the indigenous people the Arauca. The area is flat and subject to frequent flooding from the river.

At one point, it was the capital of the New Granada Province of Casanare which was much larger than the current Department of Casanare.
In addition, the Villa de Santa Bárbara de Arauca, has been:
* Capital of the Republic, under the revolutionary government, constituted July 16, 1816;
* Capital of the Police District (Comisaría especial) since 1911;
* Capital of the Province (Intendencia Nacional) of Arauca, 1955–1991;
* Oil capital of Colombia since 1986;
* Capital of the Department of Arauca since 1991.

==Climate==

==Demographics==
===Ethnic groups===
The White and Mestizo people dominate the city making up 92.4% of its population together. Blacks make up 5.9% of the city and Indigenous people make up 1.7% of the city.

==Economy==

Since its founding, Arauca&#x27;s primary business has been the raising of cattle, and this is still true. But increasingly, since 1984 it is the exploitation of nearby petroleum (oil sands) that has provided the bulk of municipal income in recent years. The building of the bridge, Puente José Antonio Páez, connecting it with Venezuela stimulated the economy, as did completion of the highway to Bogotá, known as &quot;The Route of the Liberators&quot; (&quot;La Ruta de los Libertadores&quot;). Arauca is now on the main surface route between Caracas and Bogotá.

<doc id="549662" wikidata="Q230602" url="?curid=549662" title="Cauca Department">
<text>Cauca Department (, ) is a department of Southwestern Colombia. Located in the southwestern part of the country, facing the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Valle del Cauca Department to the north, Tolima Department to the northeast, Huila Department to the east, and Nariño Department to the south. Putumayo and Caqueta Departments border the southeast portion of Cauca Department as well. It covers a total area of , the 13th largest in Colombia. Its capital is the city of Popayán. The offshore island of Malpelo belongs to the department. It is located in the southwest of the country, mainly in the Andean and Pacific regions (between 0°58′54″N and 3°19′04″N latitude, 75°47′36″W and 77°57′05″W longitude) plus a tiny part (Piamonte) in the Amazonian region. The area makes up 2.56% of the country.

==Administrative Division==
Cauca Department is divided into 42 municipalities, 99 districts, 474 police posts and numerous villages and populated places. The municipalities are grouped into 27 circles and 29 notaries: a circle-based registration in Popayán and eight sectional offices based in Bolívar, Caloto, Puerto Tejada, Santander de Quilichao, Patia, Guapi and Silvia, makes up the judicial district of Popayán. This district possesses 8 judicial circuit seats in Popayán, Bolívar, Caloto, Guapi, Patia, Puerto Tejada, Santander de Quilichao and Silvia. The department makes up the constituency of Cauca.

==Physiography==
The relief of the territory of the department of Cauca belongs to the Andean system at the macro level seven distinguishing morphological units:
# the Pacific Plate
# the Pubenza Valley
# the Western Cordillera
# the Central Cordillera
# the Popayán Plateau
# the Colombian Massif
# the Patía Valley
# a small sliver of the Amazon Basin

The Pacific Plate comprises two sectors, firstly the alluvial coastal belt or platform characterized by low, swampy, mangrove forest with many rivers estuaries subject to the ebb and flow of tides, the remainder is a plain or hills comprising the western slopes of the western cordillera.

The western cordillera in Cauca extends from southwest to northeast. Among the most important landmarks are the blade of Napí, the hills of Guaduas, Munchique, and Naya, and the Cauca River Valley. The central mountain range crosses the department from south to north; relevant landmarks include Sotará Colcano, Petacas Nevado del Huila, and the departmental boundary.

The highlands of Popayán, sandwiched between the Western and Central Cordilleras, is seen as a landmark within the plateau of the hill of La Tetilla. Among the most representative landmarks of the Colombian Massif, shared with the department of Huila, are the Páramo del Buey, the volcanoes of Cutanga and Puracé, the peak of Paletará, and the Sierra Nevada of Coconucos. Patia Valley, where the Patia River runs north–south and framed by the Central and Western mountain ranges, extends into Nariño Department. The Amazonian salient corresponds to the so-called Bota Caucana, through which flows the Japurá River.

==Colombian Massif==
The Colombian Massif, also called the Nudo de Almaguer, is a mountainous section of Andean natural region formed by the convergence of two major mountain ranges, the Central and the Eastern cordilleras. The massif extends through the departments of Cauca, Huila, and Nariño. 
Towards the south, the Colombian Massif is continued by the Pasto Massif and towards the north it diverges forming the Central and Eastern Andes. The Colombian Massif is a strategic national and international level, given its significance for water production, biodiversity and ecosystems, an area that represents a special conformation of the regions with more potential for development in Colombia.

==Hydrography==
Cauca Department can be divided into the following hydrographic regions:
# The Cauca river system, consisting of five major basins: Alto Cauca, Pacific, Alto Magdalena, Patia and Caqueta. Alto Cauca, the most important, is formed by the Cauca River and its tributaries: Palo, Guengué, Negro, Teta, Desbaratado, and Quilichao, Mondomo, Ovejas, Pescador, Robles, Piedras, Sucio, Palacé, Cofre, Honda, Cajibío, Piendamó, Tunia, Molino, Timbío and Blanco.
#Patia basin, consists of the Patia River and its tributary rivers Guachinoco, Ismita, Bojoleo, El Guaba, Sambingo and Mayo.
#Outside the Patia basin, the Pacific slope is mainly drained by the rivers Guapi, Timbiquí, Saija and Micay.
#Alto Magdalena, whose main river is the Páez River which is fed by the rivers: San Vicente, Moras, Ullucos, Negro y Negro de Narvaez, and the streams: Toez, Símbola, Salado, Gualcar, Gallo, Macana, Honda and Totumo.
#Caquetá basin, consists of the Caquetá River into which the rivers Cusiyaco, Cascabelito, Verdeyaco, Mandiyaco, Fragua, Cascabel, Curiaco and Pacayaco flow.

Gorgonilla and Gorgona islands are located in the Pacific Ocean and belong to Cauca Department.

==Economy==

The Cauca economy is based primarily on agriculture and livestock production, forestry, fishing and trade. Agriculture has been developed and modernized in the northern department, with the main crops being sugar cane, cane panela, conventional maize, rice, corn tech, banana, agave, yucca, potatoes, coconut, sorghum, cocoa, groundnut, and palm.

In the Pacific region is extracted gold, silver and platinum. Other non-precious minerals that are exploited are sulfur, asbestos, limestone, talc, gypsum and coal. The manufacturing industry is located in Popayán, Santander de Quilichao, Puerto Tejada with factories of food, beverages, dairy products, paper, packaging, wood processing, sugar industry and paper processing for export. The main centers of commercial activity are Popayán, Santander de Quilichao, Patia, Puerto Tejada, Piendamó and Corinto.

<text>Cesar Department () or simply Cesar () is a department of Colombia located in the north of the country in the Caribbean region, bordering to the north with the Department of La Guajira, to the west with the Department of Magdalena and Department of Bolivar, to the south with Department of Santander, to the east with the Department of North Santander, and further to the east with the country of Venezuela (Zulia State). The department capital city is Valledupar.

The region was first inhabited by indigenous peoples known as Euparis in the Valley of Upar and Guatapuris in the Valley of the Cesar river, among these were the Orejones pertaining to the Toupeh, Acanayutos pertaining to the Motilon and Alcoholades pertaining to the Chimila. The first European to explore the area was Spanish Captain Peter Vadillo, but German Ambrose Alfinger savagely conquered the region in 1532.

From 1996 to 2006 paramilitary groups committed gross human rights violations affecting tens of thousands of victims in the Cesar mining region.

==Etymology==

The &quot;Cesar&quot; name is an adaptation from the Chimila indigenous word &quot;Chet-tzar&quot; or &quot;Zazare&quot; (&quot;calm water&quot;) into Spanish, in reference to the Cesar River. The valley that its basin covers is also named after the river and extends through most of the department. The department of Cesar was created in 1967 by decree and the name officially adopted.

== Geography ==

The department of Cesar is located in northern Colombia bordering to the north with the department of La Guajira, to the east with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, to the west with the department of Magdalena, to the southwest with the Department of Bolivar and to the south with the departments of North Santander and Santander covering a total area of 22,905 km2.

The majority of the Department is flat in 57% of the total area and 43% mountainous mainly in the Serranía del Perijá and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain ranges.

===Ecoregions===

The Department of Cesar contains five Ecoregions; the Serranía del Perijá mountain range, the valley of the Cesar River, the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range, the valley of the Magdalena River and the Cienaga de Zapatosa marshes complex.

====Serranía del Perijá mountain range====

The &quot;Serranía del Perijá&quot; mountain range covers most of the eastern side of the Department of Cesar between its border with Venezuela and the Department of North Santander, approximately 300 km in length penetrating into the Department of La Guajira to the north and covering 27% of the total area of Cesar. The Serranía del Perijá covers, partially or totally the area of 17 municipalities in the Department of Cesar; Aguachica, Codazzi, Becerril, Chimichagua, Chiriguana, Curumani, Gonzalez, La Gloria, La Jagua de Ibirico, Los Robles La Paz, Manaure, Pailitas, Pelaya, Rio de Oro, San Alberto, San Diego and San Martin. There are also the indigenous reserves pertaining to the Yukpas people; Iroka, Socorpa and Menkue-Misaya-La Pista; and to the Wiwas people; Caño Padilla, El Rosario-Bella Vista-Yucatán and Campoalegre.

Approximately 70% of the mountain range preserves unique flora and fauna and some 20 rivers are born in the mountain range among other minor streams, flowing into the Department of Cesar and feeding the Magdalena and Cesar river basins and the Cienaga de Zapatosa marshes. The Colombian government declared it a National Forest Reserve.

====Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range====

The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range is an isolated mountain range located in the northwestern region of the Department of Cesar. The mountain range is shared with by Department of La Guajira, which covers the northern area, the Department of Magdalena to the western side and the Department of Cesar which covers the southern face, covering a total area of 16,615 km2 (1&#x27;661,500 ha) of which 380,000 ha pertain to the Department of Cesar. The Cesar River and the western side of its basin is born on the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, including the Guatapuri, Badillo, Ariguani, Cesarito, Los Clavos, Garupal and Rio Seco rivers. The mountains are within the boundaries of the municipalities of Pueblo Bello, Valledupar, El Copey and Bosconia.

The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta was declared by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve on October 29, 1993.

===Climate===
Climate in the Department of Cesar presents variations in climate depending on altitude, as well as rainfall precipitations. Mountain climate in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serranía del Perijá become cooler with higher altitude, reaching freezing low temperatures on the snowy peaks. Lowlands average a temperature throughout the year of . These lower lands present a hot and drier climate, with annual precipitation less than a year. The mountainous regions are characterized by low temperatures with snow on high altitude peaks and precipitation reaching more than a year.

== History ==
===Pre-Colombian===

The region was first inhabited by indigenous peoples known as Euparíes in the Valley of Upar and Guatapuríes in the Valley of the Cesar river, among these were the Orejones pertaining to the Tupe, Acanayutos pertaining to the Motilon and Alcoholados pertaining to the Chimila.

Spanish chronicles describe the tribes as being part of a federation of tribes led by a single chief (Cacique), with the village of &quot;Eupari&quot; as the largest and central to the other villages. These tribes are believed to be related to the Mesoamerican culture, the Caribs and Arawaks, directly associated to the Muisca culture in the Colombian eastern branch of the Andes.

Archeological findings has shown that the indigenous in the area worked with stones and wood, including a boomerang shaped weapon found in a cemetery at Los Robles La Paz.

===Spanish conquest and colonization===

The first European to explore the area was Spanish Captain Pedro de Vadillo, but German Ambrosio Alfínger savagely conquered the region in 1531. In 1550 the village of Valle de Upar was founded by Hernando de Santana and Juan de Castellanos.&lt;

===Republican era===

In 1813, María de la Concepción Loperena proclaimed the independence of Valledupar and donated 300 horses to Simón Bolívar. In 1829 Valledupar became a Cantón of the Province of Santa Marta. By Law 15 of 1850, Valledupar was segregated from Santa Marta becoming the Province of Valledupar. In 1857 became a province of the State of Magdalena and by Law of December 29, 1864, became the Department of Valledupar pertaining to State of Magdalena. On December 21, 1967, the Department of Cesar was created officially.

===Modern era===
From 1996 to 2006 paramilitary groups committed gross human rights violations affecting tens of thousands of victims in the Cesar mining region. Prodeco, a subsidiary of Glencore, and the US Drummond Company collaborated with the paramilitaries in order to continue coal mining.

==Politics==

==== Department Assembly ====

=== Administrative divisions ===

==== Municipalities ====
The Department of Cesar is formed by 25 municipalities, some 171 corregimientos, 990 veredas and 10 indigenous reserves.

For administrative reasons the Department of Cesar is subdivided into 4 strategic regions:

* the Northern Subregion covering the municipalities of Valledupar, Codazzi, Pueblo Bello, La Paz, Manaure and San Diego;
* the Northwestern Subregion covering the municipalities of Bosconia, El Copey, El Paso and Astrea;
* the Central Subregion covering the municipalities of Curumani, Becerril, Chiriguana, La Jagua de Ibirico, Chimichagua, Tamalameque and Pailitas; and
* the Southern Subregion covering the municipalities of Aguachica, Gamarra, Gonzalez, La Gloria, Pelaya, Rio de Oro, San Alberto and San Martin.

== Economy ==

The economy of the César Department is sustained by the agricultural sector, secondly by a services industry following with commercial industry and mining. Cattle raising is exploited extensively (using large farms), and for this reason large portions of forests have been chopped off to create corrals. In agriculture, plantations of cotton, rice, sugar cane, oil palm, cassava and plantain. Services are centered on commerce and the industry is represented by oil products, fats and milk derived products. As one of the biggest water resources areas of Colombia, if not America, part of the Magdalena River crosses the Department and helps create the Cienaga de Zapatosa (Zapatosa Marsh) along with the Cesar river. It has a great potential to develop a fishing industry also.

The area between La Loma and La Jagua de Ibirico is the major coal-producing region of Colombia.

<doc id="549666" wikidata="Q2746216" url="?curid=549666" title="Culture of Portugal">
<text>The culture of Portugal designates the cultural practices and traditions of the Portuguese people. It is rooted on the interactions between many different civilizations that inhabited the area during the past millennia. From prehistoric cultures, to its Pre-Roman civilizations (such as the Lusitanians, the Gallaeci, the Celtici, and the Cynetes, amongst others), passing through its contacts with the Phoenician-Carthaginian world, the Roman period (see Hispania, Lusitania and Gallaecia), the Germanic invasions of the Suebi, Buri (see Kingdom of the Suebi) and Visigoths (see Visigothic Kingdom), Viking incursions, Sephardic Jewish settlement, and finally, the Moorish Umayyad invasion of Hispania and the subsequent expulsion during the Reconquista, all have influenced the country&#x27;s culture and history.

The name of Portugal itself reveals much of the country&#x27;s early history, stemming from the Roman name &quot;Portus Cale&quot;, a Latin name meaning &quot;Port of Cale&quot; (Cale likely is a word of Celtic origin - Cailleach-Bheur her other name; the Mother goddess of the Celtic people as in Calais, Caledonia, Beira. She was the one who, with a hammer created mountains and valleys; the one who hid in stones and trees - Mother nature), later transformed into &quot;Portucale&quot;, and finally into &quot;Portugal&quot;, which emerged as a county of the Kingdom of León see County of Portugal) and became an independent kingdom in 1139. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal was a major economic, political, and cultural power, its global empire stretching from the Americas, to Africa, and various regions of Asia and Oceania. 

Portugal, as a country with a long history, is home to several ancient architectural structures, as well as typical art, furniture and literary collections mirroring and chronicling the events that shaped the country and its peoples. It has a large number of cultural landmarks ranging from museums to ancient church buildings to medieval castles. Portugal is home to fifteen UNESCO World Heritage Sites, ranking it 8th in Europe and 17th in the world.

==Overview==

The Portuguese participate in many cultural activities, indulging their appreciation of art, music, drama, and dance. Portugal has a rich traditional folklore (&quot;Ranchos Folclóricos&quot;), with great regional variety. Many cities and towns have a museum and a collection of ancient monuments and buildings. Many towns have at least a cinema, some venues to listen to music and locations to see arts and crafts. In the larger cities visits to the theatre, concerts or galleries of modern exhibitions are popular, and Portugal can boast not only international-scale venues in Lisbon, Porto, Braga, Guimarães and Coimbra but also many acclaimed artists from various disciplines. The importance of the arts is illustrated by the fact that on the death of Amália Rodrigues, the &quot;Queen of Fado&quot; (fado is Portugal&#x27;s national music) in October 1999, three days of national mourning was declared. In 1998, José Saramago, one of Portugal&#x27;s well-known writers, was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Lisbon (1994), Porto (2001) and Guimarães (2012) were all designated European Capitals of Culture, contributing to a current renaissance in artistic creation, and in 2004 Portugal hosted the European football finals in specially constructed stadiums.

In smaller towns and villages, cultural activity may revolve around local folklore, with musical groups performing traditional dance and song. Local festivities are very popular during the summer season in all kinds of localities ranging from villages to cities, as well as beach holidays from July to September. Portuguese people in almost all major towns and the cities like to know their places which are generally well equipped with modern facilities and offer a wide variety of attractions ranging from shops and stores of the most renowned brands to cinemas, restaurants and hypermarkets. Café culture is also regarded as an important cultural feature of the Portuguese. As the most popular sport, football events involving major Portuguese teams are always widely followed with great enthusiasm. There are a few bullrings in Portugal, although the passion for bullfighting was traditionally more popular in the Ribatejo and Alentejo regions.

==Architecture==



Since the second millennium BC, there has been important construction in the area where Portugal is situated today. Portugal boasts several scores of medieval castles, as well as the ruins of several villas and forts from the period of Celtic and Roman occupation. Modern Portuguese architecture follows the most advanced trends seen in European mainstream architecture with no constraints, though preserving some of its distinct characteristics. The azulejo and the Portuguese pavement are two typical elements of Portuguese architecture. Portugal is perhaps best known for its distinctive Late-Gothic Manueline architecture, with its intricate designs attributed to Portugal&#x27;s Age of Discoveries.

Another type of architecture is , owing to King John V&#x27;s long reign which lasted 44 years. Thanks to the gold from Brazil, John V of Portugal could afford foreign artists such as Nicolau Nasoni, to build outstanding works of art. The creations of Portuguese artists can be identified throughout the country, in the altars of gilded panels, blue and white tiles which adorn churches, halls, staircases and gardens.

It was during this period of prosperity, that some of the greatest Portuguese artworks were completed, including: the Royal Building of Mafra, the Clérigos Church (also known as Tower of the Clerics), the Baroque Library Biblioteca Joanina, the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte in Braga, the Shrine of Our Lady of Remedies in Lamego or the Mateus Palace in Vila Real. Because of the history of the Portuguese Empire, several countries across the world are home to sizeable heritages of Portuguese colonial architecture, notably Brazil and Uruguay in the Americas, Angola, Cabo Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Benin, Ghana, Morocco, Guinea Bissau, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique in Africa, and China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Timor Leste in Asia. Notable Portuguese architects of the past have included Diogo de Arruda (15–16th c.), João Antunes (17th c.), Eugénio dos Santos and Carlos Mardel (18th c.), José Luis Monteiro (19th c.), Raul Lino, Cassiano Branco and Fernando Távora (20th c.). Famous living architects include Gonçalo Byrne, Eduardo Souto de Moura (Pritzker winner), António Maria Braga, João Carrilho da Graça and Álvaro Siza Vieira (Priktzer winner).

There are also variations of these dances called the Chamarita in the Azores. Dance apparel is highly varied, ranging from work clothes to Sunday&#x27;s best, with rich distinguished from the poor.

==Cinema==

In the 1990s around 10 full-length fictional works were produced per annum, Portugal&#x27;s filmmakers tending to be artisans. Financing of Portuguese cinema is by state grants and from television stations. The internal market is very small and Portuguese penetration of international markets is fairly precarious. A film is considered a success when it draws an audience of more than which few Portuguese films manage to achieve.
Director Manoel de Oliveira was the oldest director in the world, and continued to make films until his death on 2 April 2015, at the age of 106. Since 1990 he made an average of one film per annum. He has received international recognition awards and won the respect of the cinematography community all over the world. Retrospectives of his works have been shown at the Los Angeles Film Festival (1992), the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (1993), the San Francisco Film Festival, and the Cleveland Museum of Art (1994). Despite his international recognition, the films of Oliveira (and that of other Portuguese directors) are neglected locally.

João César Monteiro, a member of the generation that founded the &quot;New Portuguese Cinema&quot; in the 1960s which was influenced by the Nouvelle Vague, a provocative film maker in the 1990s made &quot;O Último Mergulho&quot; (1992), &quot;A Comédia de Deus&quot; (1995), &quot;Le Bassin de John Wayne&quot; (1997) and &quot;As Bodas de Deus&quot; (1998). &quot;A Comédia de Deus&quot; won the Jury&#x27;s Special Prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1995.

Teresa Villaverde is a younger filmmaker and in the 1990s she surfaced as a director, her film (&quot;Três Irma&#x27;s&quot;, 1994) won the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival.

Significant comedy films of the 1930s and 1940s include: &quot;A Canção de Lisboa&quot; (1933) directed by José Cottinelli Telmo, starring Vasco Santana and Beatriz Costa, the second Portuguese sound feature film (the first was A Severa, a 1931 documentary by Manoel de Oliveira, was originally filmed without soundtrack, which was added afterwards), and still one of the best-loved films in Portugal, with several of its lines and songs still being quoted today; &quot;O Pai Tirano&quot; (lit. The Tyrant Father) (1941), directed by António Lopes Ribeiro, starring Vasco Santana, Francisco Ribeiro and Leonor Maia and one of the best-known comedies of the Golden Age of Portuguese Cinema; &quot;O Pátio das Cantigas&quot; (lit. The Courtyard of Songs), a comedy/ musical from 1942 directed by Francisco Ribeiro, with Vasco Santana (as Narciso), António Silva (as Evaristo), Francisco Ribeiro (as Rufino) and others. It&#x27;s a portrait of the relations between neighbours in a Lisbon courtyard. A story made of small episodes of humor, friendship, rivalry, and love.

===Alcoholic beverages===

Portugal is a country of wine lovers and winemakers, known since the Roman Empire-era; the Romans immediately associated Portugal with its God of Wine Bacchus.

Beer is also widely consumed, with the largest national beer brands being Sagres and Super Bock. Liqueurs, like Licor Beirão and Ginjinha, are popular.

==Literature==
Portuguese literature has developed since the 12th century from the lyrical works of João Soares de Paiva, Paio Soares de Taveirós and King Denis of Portugal. They wrote mostly from Galician-Portuguese and oral traditions known as &quot;Cantigas d&#x27;amor e amigo&quot; and &quot;Cantigas de escárnio e maldizer&quot;, which were consecutively performed by troubadours and joglars.

Following chroniclers such as Fernão Lopes after the 15th century, fiction has its roots in chronicles and stories linked to theatre, following Gil Vicente, the father of Portuguese theatre, whose works were often criticisms and satires of society in his time.

Classical lyrical works, include The Lusiads (&quot;Os Lusíadas&quot;) by Luís de Camões, a national epic book of the history of Portugal which incorporates elements of Ancient Greek mythology, written in the 16th century. 

Romanticism and Realism period authors from 19th century including Antero de Quental, Almeida Garrett, Camilo Pessanha, Camilo Castelo Branco, Eça de Queiroz, Alexandre Herculano, Ramalho Ortigão, Júlio Dinis and others.

Following the Carnation Revolution in 1974, the Portuguese society, after several decades of repression, regained freedom of speech.

José Saramago received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1998.

Herberto Hélder, one of the major Portuguese poets of the second half of the twentieth century, has been an influence, among many others, to the young generation of highly considered Portuguese poets and, to a lesser extend, fiction writers from a recent wave of writers such as Valter Hugo Mãe, José Luís Peixoto, Gonçalo M. Tavares, Jorge Reis-Sá, Maria Antonieta Preto, José Ricardo Pedro and others.

==Music==

Polyphonic music, employing multiple vocal parts in harmony, was developed in the 15th century. The Renaissance fostered a rich output of compositions for solo instruments and ensembles as well as for the voice.

The 1960s started a period of expansion and innovation with pop, rock and jazz introduced and evolving, political song developed, the fado of Lisbon and the Coimbra were revitalized. Music from the former colonies occupied an increasingly important place in the capital&#x27;s musical life and local styles of rap and hip hop emerged.

The modern revival of academic music was primarily work of Luís de Freitas Branco, and continued by Joly Braga Santos. Composers like António Victorino de Almeida, Jorge Peixinho, Miguel Azguime, Pedro Amaral, and João Pedro Oliveira are known internationally. Orchestras include the Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa and the Gulbenkian Orchestra. Oporto has had its own symphony orchestra since 1962, when the Chamber Orchestra was set up by the Gulbenkian Foundation. Lisbon also has a metropolitan orchestra, and the National Theatre of São Carlos in Lisbon, which was built in the late 18th century, has its own orchestra and ballet company. Among notable pianists, Maria João Pires has won worldwide acclaim.

Cultural centres such as the Belém Cultural Centre and the Culturgest, both in Lisbon, have expanded opportunities for major concerts. Madredeus is among the most successful popular music groups. Singer Dulce Pontes is also widely admired, and Carlos Paredes is considered by many to be Portugal&#x27;s finest guitarist. Folk music and dancing and the traditional fado remain the country&#x27;s fundamental forms of musical expression.

===Traditional or Folk music===

In all the times and all places mankind always showed great ingenuity making sound and music from existing materials in its natural environment. The voice and the clapping of hands can certainly be considered the first instrumental forms used by man.

The Iberian Peninsula was home to a lot of different peoples and cultures, so its normal to these cultures to influence the others but still retain a little of their aspects - this happened with the Portuguese music.

Portuguese folk music is the joint of the traditional songs of a community that express through a poetic character their beliefs and tell their history to other people and generations. The danças do vira (Minho), Pauliteiros de Miranda (Miranda), Corridinho do Algarve or Bailinho (Madeira), are some examples of dances created by the sound of folk. Some of the typical instruments used are a guitar, mandolin, bagpipes, accordion, violin, drums, Portuguese guitar and an enormous variety of wind and percussion instruments.
Contemporary bands include Dazkarieh, Cornalusa, Gaitúlia, Strella do Dia etc.

===Philharmonic music===
In the popular culture the philharmonic bands represent each locality and play different types of music, from popular to classical. Lidia Costa, Carlos Marques, Alberto Madurai, José Caminos and Railcar Morays are some of the most important names in philharmonic music.

===Fado===
Fado (translated as destiny or ) is a music genre which can be traced from the 1820s, but possibly with much earlier origins. It is characterized by mournful tunes and lyrics, often about the sea or the life of the poor. The music is usually linked to the Portuguese word &quot;saudade&quot;, a unique word with no accurate translation in any other language. (Home-sickness has an approximate meaning. It is a kind of longing, and conveys a complex mixture of mainly nostalgia, but also sadness, pain, happiness and love).

There are two main varieties of fado, namely those of the cities of Lisbon and Coimbra. The Lisbon style is the most popular, while Coimbra&#x27;s is the more refined style. Modern fado is popular in Portugal, and has produced many renowned musicians. According to tradition, to applaud fado in Lisbon you clap your hands, in Coimbra you cough as if clearing your throat.

Mainstream fado performances during the 20th century included only a singer, a Portuguese guitar player and a classical guitar player but more recent settings range from singer and string quartet to full orchestra.

The ingredients of Fado are a shawl, a guitar, a voice and heartfelt emotion.

Themes include: destiny, deep-seated feelings, disappointments in love, the sense of sadness and longing for someone who has gone away, misfortune, the ups and downs of life, the sea, the life of sailors and fishermen, and last but not least &quot;Saudade&quot; (one of the main themes used in fado, that means a kind of longing).

Fado is probably the oldest urban folk music in the world and represents the heart of the Portuguese soul, and for that matter fado performance is not successful if an audience is not moved to tears.

===Classical music===
Portugal has been an important centre of practice and production of music over the centuries, as the music history of Portugal expresses. In contemporary classical music, notable Portuguese musicians include the pianists Artur Pizarro, Maria João Pires and Equeira Costa, and the composers: Fernando Lopes-Graça, Emmanuel Nunes, João Pedro Oliveira, Jorge Peixinho, Constança Capdeville, Clotilde Rosa, Fernando Corrêa de Oliveira, Cláudio Carneyro, Frederico de Freitas, Joly Braga Santos and Isabel Soveral.

===Portuguese rock===

The Portuguese rock started to be noted in 1980 with the release of Ar de Rock by Rui Veloso, which was the first popular Portuguese rock song, other Portuguese bands and singers such as Sétima Legião, , Jafumega, Mão Morta, Taxi, Peste e Sida, were popular too. Before that, Portugal had a vibrant underground progressive rock scene in the 1970s like Tantra, Quarteto 1111, José Cid and others in 1950 and 1960 rock and roll scene with bands like Os Conchas and Os Sheiks. Among the numerous bands and artists which followed its genesis, are Xutos &amp; Pontapés, GNR, Quinta do Bill, UHF, The Gift and Moonspell.

===Popular music===
The 1980s and 1990s were marked by the search for a new musical discourse in urban popular music, the increase, commodification and industrialization of musical production, and the mediatization and expansion of music consumption. The boom in Portuguese musical production was accompanied by both the diversification of the musical domains and styles produced and consumed in Portugal and the emergence of new styles which are increasingly taking the global market into account. The denominated Pop music uses melodies easily to memorize, becoming very popular and commercial; it&#x27;s also characterized by the amount of publicity made (through videos, magazines, appealing clothing, etc.).

It is possible to note two stylistic tendencies in the popular music of the 1980s and 1990s:
* A musical discourse created by Portuguese musicians that is integrated within the major international developments experienced by commercial popular music;
* A new musical style that vindicates its Portugueseness by both drawing upon various musical elements which musicians and audiences alike identify as Portuguese and emphasizing the Portuguese language.

===Canções de intervenção (political songs)===
Political songs () played an important part in the protests against the totalitarian regime that ruled Portugal from 1926 up to the 1974 revolution. Once it was created as an object to criticize what was wrong, mainly in a political point of view. One of its main protagonists was José (Zeca) Afonso (1929–1987) but others also contributed to its development, for example Adriano Correia de Oliveira, José Mário Branco, , , José Jorge Letria, José Barata Moura and Sérgio Godinho. They traced a new course for urban popular music and influenced a further generation of musicians, some of whom also participated in the protest movement and are still active, including Fausto, Vitorino, and Júlio Pereira, among others.

This musical style reflects a confluence of influences from traditional music, French urban popular songs of the 1960s, African music and Brazilian popular music. By the late 1970s the revolutionary climate had subsided and the need to express political militancy through song was no longer felt by poets, composers and singers, who subsequently redefined both their role and their creative contribution.

===Hip hop===

Hip hop has been important since the 1980s with areas like Amadora, Cacém and the South Bank of the Tagus are considered to be the cradle of Hip Hop Tuga.

The compilation called &quot;Rapublica&quot; released in 1994, which featured young rising artists and groups such as Black Company and Boss AC, is responsible for establishing hip hop in Portugal. The refrain from a song called &quot;Não sabe nadar, yo&quot; (&quot;Can&#x27;t swim, yo!&quot;) was used by the president of Portugal, Mário Soares in a speech about the cave painting in Foz Côa saying that &quot;As gravuras não sabem nadar, yo!&quot; (&quot;The engravings can&#x27;t swim, yo!&quot;).

Apart from Lisbon, other urban centers also established vibrant hip hop scenes during the early nineties, especially Porto, that gave birth to important groups such as Mind Da Gap. More recently other local scenes have also developed on other urban centers, such as Coimbra and Faro.

There are two major showcase events, Flowfest and Hip Hop Porto. Flowfest, in Coimbra, started in 2005. Hip Hop Porto is a free event held at Casa da Música, in September. It features mainly the northern hip hop names as headliners, drawing a very local audience. Its first edition in 2005 carded Rodney P, NBC, Blackmastah, Bomberjack, Rui Miguel Abreu, etc. Usually the event is held outdoors, but in 2006 the heavy rains made the event relocate to the parking lot of the building, causing a really &quot;underground&quot; look.

===Students festivals===

Festivals organised by students of several higher education institutions, take place every year across the country. The &#x27;Queima das Fitas&#x27; in Coimbra and Porto and &#x27;Enterro da Gata&#x27; in Minho. Summer festivals include Vilar de Mouros Festival, Festival Sudoeste, Rock in Rio Lisboa, Super Bock Super Rock, Festival de Paredes de Coura, Boom Festival, Ilha do Ermal Festival, etc.

==Painting==

Portuguese art was very restricted in the early years of nationality, during the reconquista, to a few paintings in churches, convents and palaces.

It was after the 15th century, with national borders established and with the discoveries, that Portuguese art expanded. Some kings, like John I already had royal painters. It is during this century that Gothic art was replaced by a more humanistic and Italian-like art.

During the reign of King Alfonso V, an important Portuguese artist Nuno Gonçalves shaped Portuguese art, leading it to gain local characteristics (&quot;Escola Nacional&quot;, National School). His influence on Portuguese art continued after his death. He was the royal painter for the famous &quot;Retábulo do Altar das Relíquias de São Vicente&quot; in the Cathedral of Lisbon (&quot;Sé de Lisboa&quot;). The painting caught fire and was replaced by a Baroque structure. Parts of his work still exist and can be found in the &quot;Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga National&quot; (Museum of Ancient Art).

During the Golden Age of Portugal, in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Portuguese artists were influenced by Flemish art, and were in turn influential on Flemish artists of the same period. During this period, Portuguese art became internationally well-known, mostly because of its very original and diverse characteristics, but little is known about the artists of this time due to the medieval culture that considered painters to be artisans. The anonymous artists in the Portuguese &quot;escolas&quot; produced art not only for metropolitan Portugal but also for its colonies, namely Malacca or Goa and even Africa, gratifying the desires of local aristrocratic clients and religious clients.

In the 19th century, naturalist and realist painters like Columbano, Henrique Pousão and Silva Porto revitalized painting against a decadent academic art.

In the early 20th century, Portuguese art increased both in quality and quantity, mainly due to members of the Modernist movement like Amadeo de Souza Cardoso and Almada Negreiros. In the post-war years the abstractionist painter Vieira da Silva settled in Paris and gained widespread recognition, as did her contemporary Paula Rego.

==Theater==
Portugal never developed a great Dramatic theatre tradition due primarily to the fact that the Portuguese were more passionate about lyric or humorous works than dramatic art. Gil Vicente is often seen as the father of Portuguese theatre - he was the leading Portuguese playwright in the 16th century. During the 20th century, theatre found a way to reach out to the people, specially the middle class, through what in Portugal is known as &quot;Revista&quot; - a form of humorous and cartoonish theatre designed to expose and criticize social (and political) issues, but in a way that entertains and amuses the audience.

Gil Vicente (1435–1536) is considered the first great Portuguese playwright. Frequently called the father of Portuguese theatre, he portrays the society of the 16th century. Anticipating the 17th-century French writer Jean-Baptiste de Santeul&#x27;s well-known phrase &quot;castigat ridendo mores&quot;, Gil Vicente became famous for his satirical plays such as the &quot;Triologia das Barcas&quot; (&quot;Auto da Barca do Inferno&quot; (1517), &quot;Auto da Barca do Purgatório&quot; (1518); &quot;Auto da Barca da Glória&quot; (1518)). In these plays, he creates some characters who are representative of their social group. This results in not only comical, but also strong critical situations. Gil Vicente also wrote other important plays such as &quot;Auto da Índia&quot; (1509), &quot;Auto da Fama&quot; (1510), and &quot;Farsa de Inês Pereira&quot; (1523).

Another relevant playwright of the 16th century is António Ferreira (1528–1569), who wrote &quot;Castro&quot; (1587), a well-known tragedy about the forbidden love between D. Pedro I and D. Inês de Castro. António Ferreira is considered the father of Renaissance culture in Portugal.

One of the most famous playwrights of the 18th century is António José da Silva (1705–1739), commonly known as &quot;O Judeu&quot; because of his Judaic origins. He wrote several plays such as &quot;Os Encantos de Medeia&quot; (1735), &quot;As Variedades de Proteu&quot; (1737) and &quot;Precipício de Faetonte&quot; (1738).

Almeida Garrett (1799–1854) was a turning point in Portuguese literature as far as the themes are concerned. His most outstanding play is &quot;Frei Luís de Sousa&quot; (1844), which became a classic of Portuguese theatre. Garrett also wrote &quot;Um Auto de Gil Vicente&quot; (1838), &quot;Filipa de Vilhena&quot; (1846) and &quot;O Alfageme de Santarém&quot; (1842). These three plays as well as &quot;Frei Luís de Sousa&quot; are somehow connected with Portuguese history. Furthermore, Garrett is also the founder of the &quot;Conservatório Geral de Arte Dramática&quot; as well as of the &quot;Teatro Nacional D. Maria II&quot;.

In the late 19th century, two Portuguese playwrights of Goan descent, Lucasinho Ribeiro and João Agostinho Fernandes, emerged as leading figures for introducing &quot;tiatr&quot;, a musical theatre based on Portuguese theatre &quot;teatro&quot;. Ribeiro was the first to introduce the art form in Bombay, British India, and later in Assagão, Portuguese Goa.

As far as the 20th century is concerned, it&#x27;s worth noticing Bernardo Santareno&#x27;s (1920–1980) work. His most famous play is &quot;O Judeu&quot;, based upon the life of António José da Silva, mentioned above. Santareno also wrote &quot;A Promessa&quot; (1957), &quot;O Crime da Aldeia Velha&quot; (1959) and &quot;Anunciação&quot; (1962). Most of his plays deal with universal questions such as liberty, oppression and discrimination.

Born in 1926, Luís de Sttau Monteiro (1926–1993) wrote several plays, some of them portraying and criticising Portuguese society of his time. His most famous play is &quot;Felizmente Há Luar&quot; (1961), which is a strong criticism of the political context of that time (dictatorship – Estado Novo). &quot;O Barão&quot; (1965), &quot;A Guerra Santa&quot; (1967) and &quot;Sua Excelência&quot; (1971) were also written by Sttau Monteiro.

In the 20th century, theatre in Portugal became more popular with the &quot;Revista&quot; – a comical and satirical form of theatre. It is a creative way of expressing one&#x27;s ideas as well as criticising political and social problems. The most important actors who performed this form of theatre in the 20th century were Vasco Santana (1898–1958), Beatriz Costa (1907–1996) and Ivone Silva (1935–1987). Nowadays it is worth mentioning Maria João Abreu, José Raposo and Fernando Mendes, who perform this form of theatre at the well known &quot;Parque Mayer&quot; (a theatre district in Lisbon where the &quot;Revista&quot; used to be performed).

Important Portuguese actors include Ruy de Carvalho, Eunice Muñoz, Rui Mendes, Irene Cruz and Luís Miguel Cintra.

In later years, theatre in Portugal has developed into many other forms as in any other European country. Almost every repertoire can be seen in Portugal. Many companies have the works of Shakespeare, Molière, Brecht, Becket or Chekhov, and Portuguese classic and modern authors on their repertoire. Other companies show more experimental projects. All this makes the theatre repertoire very varied. Some of the most important professional theatre companies nowadays are: Teatro da Cornucópia, Teatro da Comuna, Teatro Aberto, Teatro Meridional, Teatro da Garagem, Companhia de Teatro de Almada, Companhia Teatral do Chiado, A Barraca, Teatro dos Aloés, Teatro Praga, Artistas Unidos, Seiva Trupe, As boas raparigas, ACTA, among many others.

Portugal hosts several festivals such as FITEI, ACERT, FIAR, and the International Theatre Festival of Almada (FITA).

== Fashion and design ==

Industrialized, export-oriented fashion and design in clothing, footwear, kitchenware and furniture industries, was pioneered by fashion designers like Eduarda Abbondanza, Mário Matos Ribeiro, Ana Salazar, José António Tenente, João Tomé, Francisco Pontes or Manuela Gonçalves, as well as textile industry industrialists established in places like Vale do Ave, in clothing; several entrepreneurs of the Portuguese footwear industry; Vista Alegre Atlantis and Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro, in tableware and kitchenware; and businesspersons of the old-established furniture industry heavily concentrated in and around places such as Paços de Ferreira and Paredes. Corkware and other cork-based products such as furniture, decorative items and floor and wall coatings, are also distinctive products found among typical designer creations of Portuguese origin.

Filigree began to be produced in Portugal in the 8th century with the arrival of Arab migrants after the Umayyad invasion of Iberian Peninsula, who brought new patterns with them. With time, the peninsula began to produce different filigree patterns, but while in Spain the filigree jewellery-making tradition became less relevant, in Portugal it was perfected. After the 18th century, Portuguese Filigree already had its own distinctive imagery, motifs and shapes. Filigree from the 17th and 18th centuries became famous for their extraordinary complexity. Gold and silver filigree jewellery of delicate and artistic design is still made in considerable quantities throughout the country, particularly filigree hearts, which are iconic symbols of Portuguese jewellery-making.

==Folklore==

, , , , , , and are mythical beings that form part of Portuguese folklore. These legends and traditions are preserved in the lore and literature of older generations, frequently seen as the remains of pre-Christian traditions. The lore associates the ancient monuments to the legends of the Enchanted Mouras and nearly every Portuguese town has a tale of a Moura Encantada.

==Festivities and holidays==
During the summer, in the month of June, festivities dedicated to three saints known as &quot;Santos Populares&quot; take place all over Portugal. Why the populace associated the saints to these pagan festivities is not known. But they are possibly related to Roman or local deities from the time before Christianity spread in the region. The three saints are Saint Anthony, Saint John and Saint Peter. Common fare in these festivities are wine, &quot;água-pé&quot; (mostly grape juice), and traditional bread along with sardines. During the festivities are many weddings, traditional street dances and fireworks.

Saint Anthony is celebrated on the night of 12th-13 June, especially in Lisbon (where that saint was born and lived most of his life), with &quot;Marchas Populares&quot; (a street carnival) and other festivities. In the meantime, several marriages known as &quot;Casamentos de Santo António&quot; (Marriages of Saint Anthony) are made. But the most popular saint is Saint John, he is celebrated in many cities and towns throughout the country on the night of the 23rd-24th, especially in Porto and Braga, where the sardines, &quot;caldo verde&quot; (traditional soup) and plastic hammers to hammer in another person&#x27;s head for luck are indispensable. The final saint is Saint Peter, celebrated in the night of 28th-29th, especially in Póvoa de Varzim and Barcelos, the festivities are similar to the others, but more dedicated to the sea and with an extensive use of fire (&quot;fogueiras&quot;). In Póvoa de Varzim, there is the &quot;Rusgas&quot; in the night, another sort of street carnival. Each festivity is a municipal holiday in the cities and towns where it occurs.

Carnival is also widely celebrated in Portugal, some traditional carnivals date back several centuries. Loulé, Alcobaça, Mealhada, Funchal, Torres Vedras, Ovar and Figueira da Foz, among several other localities, hold several days of festivities, with parades where social and political criticism abound, along with music and dancing in an environment of . There are some localities which preserve a more traditional carnival with typical elements of the ancient carnival traditions of Portugal and Europe. However, several parades in most localities have adopted many elements of the tropical Brazilian Carnival.

On January 6, Epiphany is celebrated by some families, especially in the North and Center, where the family gathers to eat &quot;Bolo Rei&quot; (literally, King Cake, a cake made with crystallized fruits); this is also the time for the traditional carols - &quot;As Janeiras&quot;, the new year&#x27;s Wassailing.

Saint Martin Day, is celebrated on November 11. This day is the peak of three days, often with very good weather, it is known as &quot;Verão de São Martinho&quot; (&quot;Saint Martin summer&quot;), the Portuguese celebrate it with &quot;jeropiga&quot; (a sweet liqueur wine) and roasted Portuguese chestnuts (&quot;castanhas assadas&quot;), and it is called &quot;Magusto&quot;.

==Sports and games==


Football is the most popular sport in Portugal. Football started to become well known in Portugal in the final decades of the 19th century, brought by Portuguese students who returned from England.

The first person responsible for its implementation was Guilherme Pinto Basto (according to some people, his brothers Eduardo and Frederico brought the first ball from England). It was he who had the initiative to organise an exhibition of the new game, which took place in October 1888 in Cascais, and it was also Pinto Basto who organized the first official football match in January of the following year. The match, played where today is found the &quot;Campo Pequeno Bullring&quot; in Lisbon, involved opposing teams from Portugal and England. The Portuguese team won the game 2–1. Consequently, football started attracting the attention of the high society, being distinguished by the Luso-British rivalry.

Later, the game spread, being practiced in colleges, and leading to the foundation of clubs all over the country. Until the end of the century, associations such as &quot;Clube Lisbonense&quot;, &quot;Carcavelos&quot;, &quot;Braço de Prata&quot;, the &quot;Real Ginásio Clube Português&quot;, the &quot;Estrela Futebol Clube&quot;, the &quot;Futebol Académico&quot;, the &quot;Campo de Ourique&quot;, the Oporto Cricket, and the &quot;Sport Clube Vianense&quot; were founded to practice this sport or created sections for competing. The first match, between Lisbon and Porto, took place in 1894, attended by King D. Carlos. The &quot;Clube Internacional de Futebol&quot; (founded in 1902) was the first Portuguese team to play abroad defeating, in 1907, the &quot;Madrid Futebol Clube&quot; in the Spanish capital.

The oldest football club in Portugal is &quot;Futebol Clube do Porto&quot; which was founded in 1893 (as Foot-Ball Club do Porto). &quot;Sport Lisboa e Benfica&quot; was born in 1904, with Cosme Damião and other people being the founders (the club maintained the foundation date of &quot;Sport Lisboa&quot;, founded in 1904, when in 1908 assimilated the &quot;Grupo Sport Benfica&quot;, founded in 1906). The &quot;Boavista Futebol Clube&quot; was founded in 1903. The &quot;Sporting Clube de Portugal&quot; was founded in 1906 by the Viscount of Alvalade and his grandson José de Alvalade. They are all clubs that traditionally have several sports activities but they give great distinction to football, making use of teams of professional players, which frequently participate in European competitions.

In April 2010, the Portugal national football team was ranked 3rd out of 207 countries by FIFA. The legendary Eusébio is still a symbol of Portuguese football. Luís Figo was voted 2001 Player of the Year by FIFA, after finishing 2nd in 2000. Manuel Rui Costa and Cristiano Ronaldo are also noteworthy, although Vítor Baía is the player in history with most titles won, including all European club cups. Moreover, José Mourinho is regarded as one of the most successful and well-paid football managers in football&#x27;s history. The main domestic football competition is the Primeira Liga, where the dominating teams are S.L. Benfica, FC Porto, and Sporting CP. Portugal hosted and nearly won EURO 2004, getting defeated in the final by surprise winner Greece. The Portuguese national team also reached the semi-finals of the FIFA World Cup twice, in 1966, when Eusébio was the top scorer, with 9 goals, and also in 2006. The year 2006 was the year that Portugal nearly won the FIFA World Cup tournament, ranking 4th overall, being defeated by France and Germany. This was the first time since 1966, that the Portuguese football team had advanced to such a high qualifying round in a World Cup tournament. The national team defeated hosts France in the 2016 edition of the UEFA Euro, their first major international trophy.

Other than football, many other professional and well organized sport competitions take place every season in Portugal, including basketball, swimming, athletics, tennis, gymnastics, futsal, handball, and volleyball among the hundreds of sports played in this country.

Road cycling, with &quot;Volta a Portugal&quot; as the most important race, is also popular.

In rink hockey, Portugal is the country with the most world titles: 15 World Championships and 20 European Championships, and in rugby sevens, the Portuguese team has won many international trophies, having as of July 2006, five European Championship titles.

Golf is also worth mentioning, since its greatest players play in the sunny region of the Algarve, during the &quot;Algarve Open&quot;.

The Autódromo Fernanda Pires da Silva in the Estoril, near Lisbon, is the main Portuguese race track, where many motorsport competitions are held, including the World Motorcycling Championship and A1 Grand Prix.

Rallying (with the Rally of Portugal and Rally Madeira) and off-road (with the Baja Portugal 1000 and recently Lisboa-Dakar) events also have international recognition.

Triathlon is also giving important steps, thanks to the world cup leader Vanessa Fernandes, and her European and world titles. She is also the duathlon European and world champion.

The national team of shooting sports won the gold medal in the teams event, and Paulo Cleto won silver in the single men&#x27;s competition.

Martial arts like judo have also brought many medals to this country, namely Telma Monteiro, who conquered gold twice at the European Championships in the -52 kg category, bronze in 2005 world championship in Cairo, and achieved silver in 2007 World Judo Championships. Nuno Delgado, who conquered the bronze medal in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, also became the European champion in 1999 (in Bratislava), and vice-champion in the year of 2003.

Manuel Centeno is also a major name in Portuguese sports, as he conquered the national, European and the world titles, in 2006 in bodyboarding after being the European champion back in 2001.

In surfing, Justin Mujica, European surfing champion in 2004, is now back in the competitions after recovering from a knee injury. Tiago Pires reached the number one position at ASP WQS rating, and will probably be part of the main surfing competition. Ruben Gonzalez is an international acclaimed surfer and the only one to achieve the national title in two consecutive tournaments.

The Portuguese team of basketball made a unique qualification to the European Championships and made through the second round, where it was eliminated.

&quot;Os Lobos&quot; (Portugal national rugby union team) made a dramatic qualification to the 2007 Rugby World Cup, becoming the world&#x27;s only all-amateur team ever to qualify for that kind of event.

In fencing, Joaquim Videira won the silver medal at the épée 2006 World Fencing Championships, and has conquered numerous medals in the world cup.

The major Portuguese professional sports leagues, championships and events include:
* Portuguese Football Championship and Cup of Portugal in football.
* Portuguese Futsal First Division in futsal.
* Portuguese Basketball League in basketball.
* Portuguese Roller Hockey First Division in rink hockey.
* Portuguese Handball League in handball.
* Campeonato Nacional Honra/Super Bock in rugby.
* Portuguese Volleyball League A1 in volleyball.
* Portuguese Beach Soccer League in beach soccer.
* Volta a Portugal in road cycling.
* Rally of Portugal in motor racing.

The country has an ancient martial art known as &quot;Jogo do Pau&quot; (Portuguese Stick Fencing), which is used for self-protection and for duels between young men in disputes over young women. Having its origin in the Middle Ages, Jogo do Pau uses wooden staves as a combat weapon.

Other sports are the &quot;Jogos Populares&quot;, a wide variety of traditional sports played for fun.

In addition to this, other popular sport-related recreational outdoor activities with thousands of enthusiasts nationwide include airsoft, fishing, golf, hiking, hunting, and orienteering.

<doc id="549667" wikidata="Q230584" url="?curid=549667" title="Chocó Department">
<text>Chocó Department () is a department of the Pacific region of Colombia known for hosting the largest Afro-Colombian population in the nation, and a large population of Amerindian and mixed African-Amerindian Colombians. It is in the west of the country, and is the only Colombian department to have coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. It contains all of Colombia&#x27;s border with Panama. Its capital is Quibdó.

Chocó has a diverse geography, unique ecosystems and unexploited natural resources; however, its population has one of the lowest standards of living of all departments in Colombia. A major factor cited by the government is the rugged, montane rainforest environment and the hot, hyperhumid climate. These factors have limited any significant infrastructure improvements to the region, and Chocó remains one of the most isolated regions of Colombia, with no major transportation infrastructure built since initial foundations were laid down in 1967 for a highway connecting Chocó with the city of Medellín.

The area has little access to medical care. In August 2016, Colombian media reported that some 50 children starved in less than three months, creating awareness of the grave condition Chocó’s inhabitants are facing. That same year, an additional 10 adults and senior citizens, of the indigenous community in Chocó, died due to preventable causes such as malaria and diarrhea. In spite of the department’s ranking of “world&#x27;s rainiest lowland” (the Chocó–Darién moist forests ecoregion), with close to of annual precipitation, Quibdó lacks sanitary drinking water.
==History==

The first city founded by conquistadors in mainland America was Santa María la Antigua del Darién, founded by Vasco Núñez de Balboa in 1510 and disestablished in 1524, just 14 years later.
The department was created in 1944. Its low population, mountainous and inhospitable topography, and distance from Bogotá resulted in Chocó receiving little attention from the Colombian government. During the reign of military dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, his administration proposed to eliminate Chocó and divide its territory between the departments of Antioquia and Valle del Cauca. But the 1957 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of General Gabriel París Gordillo overthrew Pinilla&#x27;s government and ended such plans.

==Geography==
The Chocó Department makes up most of the ecoregion known as El Chocó that extends from Panama to Ecuador.

The municipality of Lloró holds the record for the world’s highest average annual precipitation, measured at which makes it the wettest place in the world. Three large rivers drain the Chocó Department, the Atrato (which runs north, with tributaries that also flow north), the San Juan, and the Baudó. Each has many tributaries. The Baudó Mountains on the coast and the inland Cordillera Occidental are cut by low valleys, with an altitude less than 1,000 meters, that form most of the territory. Most of the Chocó is thick rainforest. Much of the wood for Colombia&#x27;s internal consumption is harvested from the Chocó, with a small percentage harvested for export.
Chocó Department produces the majority of Colombia&#x27;s significant platinum output (28,359 ounces of platinum in 2011). Chocó is also Colombia&#x27;s top gold-producing region (653,625 ounces in 2011). In the late 19th century, it attracted a variety of miners from many countries seeking to make their fortunes in gold.

== Biodiversity ==
The Chocó is a Key Biodiversity Area (KBA). According to the United Nations Development Program, it contains the &#x27;greatest plant biodiversity on the planet (and) twenty-five percent of the plant and bird species living in this region are endemic.&#x27; Globally, Chocó is among 25 regions classified as priority biodiversity hotspots. 

Threats to this rich biodiversity, despite the region&#x27;s conservation priority status, are many. Approximately 80% of the forest has been converted to other uses, such as slash-and-burn and intensive agriculture, inappropriate and illegal logging, and cattle ranching.

Measuring the extent of biodiversity loss in Chocó thus far was previously difficult due to the remoteness of most of the region. However, with advances in LiDAR imaging and the efforts of various nonprofit conservation organizations, there is much documentation to identify and quantify the environmental degradation and biodiversity loss. 

For example, a 2019 analysis of more than 80,000 ha of LiDAR samples to quantify the vegetation structure, disturbance, and elevation in Chocó forests, a loss of more than 115 million tons of dry biomass, or 58 million tons of carbon was documented.

El Pangán ProAves Reserve, in the biogeographic region of Chocó, charged with protecting area&#x27;s biodiversity, with special consideration of protecting bird species, is greatly challenged and not sufficiently equipped to meet the numerous conservation threats to a great diversity of fauna and flora that include 300 bird species. Forest degradation takes at least 50 years to regenerate, and regeneration efforts are not keeping pace with the rate of further deforestation. Soil erosion, negative effects on species&#x27; feeding and reproductive cycles, fragmentation of habitat, and loss of species are all consequences of this large-scale deforestation.

==Demographics==

The Chocó is inhabited predominantly by Afro-Colombians, descendants of enslaved Africans imported and brought to this area by the Spanish colonizers after conquering the Americas. The second largest race/ethnic group are the Embera, a Native American people. More than half of their total population in Colombia lives in Chocó, some 35,500. They practice hunting and artisan fishing and live near rivers.

The total population as of 2005 was less than half a million, with more than half living in the Quibdó valley. According to a 2005 census the ethnic composition of the department is:

* Blacks, Mulattos and Zambos (82.1%)
* Amerindians or Indigenous (12.7%)
* Whites, Castizos and Mestizos (5.2%)

==Towns and municipalities==
Quibdó is the largest city, with a population of almost 100,000. Other important cities and towns include Istmina, Condoto, Alto Baudó, Riosucio and El Carmen de Atrato in the interior, Acandí on the Caribbean Coast, and Bahía Solano on the Pacific Coast.

Resorts and Tourist destinations include Capurganá on the Caribbean Coast, and Juradó, Nuquí, and Solano Bay on the West Coast.

<text>Yozgat is a city in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey. It is the seat of Yozgat Province and Yozgat District. Its population is 92,643 (2022).

==History==
Formerly known as Bozok, the area surrounding Yozgat hosted many civilizations such as that of Pteria. and Corniaspa (East of Yozgat).

The first surveys were started in the year 1993. Since then archaeologists have uncovered countless artifacts belonging to 5 different ancient civilizations from the area and as well as artifacts that belong to 5 different eras – the Bronze, Hellenistic, Hittite, Copper and Upper Byzantine eras.

Surface excavations and surveys were also undertaken on the Kerkenes plateau by Dr. Geoffery Summers, a British archaeologist. The plateau is believed to be the home to the lost city of Pteria. The search for this lost city as well as other old world constructions began in 2013, and it plans to go on till the month of August as well. The expedition covers an area which is surrounded by walls and is known to date back to almost 2600 years.

According to historical reports, Pteria was destroyed, burned and abandoned during the Battle of Pteria between the Lydians and the Medes. This battle ended during a solar eclipse on 28 May 585 BC, and it was understood to be an omen that the gods wanted the fighting to stop.

Another excavation site in the region that deserves to be mentioned is in Kusaklu Tumulus. A team headed by Dr. Stefania Mazzoni has been working at the site since the year 2008, and it is believed that the Hittite civilization as well as the city of Zippalandawas once existed in the region. As a part of these excavations a 2000-year-old Roman bath that was said to be used to heal people from their wounds has been discovered. Traces of the Roman, Seljuq, Byzantine and Ottoman eras have also been found in the region.

With so much of history yet to be uncovered from a single city, archaeologists remain hopeful of unearthing many more wonders of the ancient world in the next few months. It has already been proved that the area was home to numerous civilizations that date all the way back to the Roman era. Archaeologists remain hopeful of managing to unearth many more old world structures and secrets as time passes by.

After the old administrative center of the region, Tavium (Büyüknefes), became ruined, a new centre was created by Çapanoğlu, the founder of a powerful derebey family and called Bozok.

=== Ottoman era ===
The Ottoman Empire annexed Yozgat in 1398. At around 1911, it was the chief town of a sanjak of the same name in the Ankara Vilayet. There was a trade in yellow madder (Stil de grain yellow) and mohair. The sanjak was very fertile, and contained good breeding-grounds in which cattle, horses and even camels were reared for the local agriculture and foreign trade.

Yozgat was the site of a prisoner of war camp in the First World War, holding British and Empire officers captured at the Siege of Kut, including E. H. Jones and C. W. Hill, whose escape attempts were recounted in the book &quot;The Road to En-dor&quot;.

==Geography==
The town is located at an elevation of 4,380 ft (1,335 m), situated 105 mi (170 km) east of Ankara, near the head of a narrow valley through which the Ankara–Sivas road runs. Like much of the Anatolian Plateau, the lands around Yozgat have been deforested over thousands of years of human habitation. This makes the climate and weather harsh, in summers and winters. However, Turkey has taken great steps to reforest at least some of the region.

===Climate===
Yozgat has a continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dsb&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Dc&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and warm, dry summers. Hottest month averages at during the day. Winter temperatures can drop as low as at the height of the season.

==Sights==
The main sights of the city of Yozgat are the Yozgat Clock Tower built in 1908 and the Çapanoğlu Mosque built by the Çapanoğlu family, who are the founders of Yozgat. Yozgat Pine Grove National Park is an area of in which different types of pine trees grow, some up to 500 years old.

==Sport==

The city&#x27;s football team Yozgatspor plays in the Turkish Regional Amateur League.

<doc id="549672" wikidata="Q238645" url="?curid=549672" title="Guainía Department">
<text>Guainía (; Yuri language: &quot;Land of many waters&quot;) is a department of Eastern Colombia. It is in the east of the country, bordering Venezuela and Brazil. Its capital is Inírida. In 1963 Guainía was split off from Vaupés department. The northern part and the Inírida River are included in the Orinoco basin; the rest is part of the Amazon basin. The Guaviare River is the main area of colonization; many &quot;colonos&quot; come from the Colombian Andean zone, most of them from Boyacá. They are followed by the &quot;llaneros&quot;, people from the Eastern plains (Llanos). The population is mainly composed of Amerindians, and the largest ethnic groups are the &quot;Puinaves&quot; (from the &quot;makú-puinave&quot; family) and the &quot;curripacos&quot; (from the &quot;Arawak&quot; family). There are a total of 24 ethnic groups in the department; many of them speak four Indigenous languages besides Spanish and Portuguese.

== Municipalities ==
There are two municipalities in Guainía: Inírida, its capital, and Barranco Minas. The rest of the territory is subdivided in &quot;corregimientos departamentales&quot;, a pending figure due to public disorder.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlSentencia C-141/01&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This case happens only in Amazonas, Vaupés and Vichada. Barranco Minas is the second biggest population and a municipality since 2019; it is located on the Guaviare River.

The Guainía corregimientos are:
# Cacahual
# La Guadalupe
# Mapiripana
# Morichal Nuevo
# Pana Pana
# Puerto Colombia
# San Felipe

<text>Guaviare () is a department of Colombia. It is in the southern central region of the country. Its capital is San José del Guaviare. Guaviare was created on July 4, 1991, by the new Political Constitution of Colombia. Up until that point, it was a national territory that operated as a commissariat, segregated from territory of the then Commissariat of Vaupés on December 23, 1977.

== History ==
Originally inhabited by the indigenous Nukak people, Guaviare was one of the regions colonized during the Amazon rubber boom of the 1910s and 1940s. Many families migrated from the centre of the country, seeking fast revenue and escaping from the bi-partisan violence taking place in other regions of Colombia. Nevertheless, the &#x27;rubber fever&#x27; ended quickly, leaving the new inhabitants of Guaviare alone in an immense rainforest difficult to conquer. The boom of cocaine in the second half of the 20th century attracted new colonizers who migrated from other impoverished regions attracted by the coca revenues.  Following this new wave of colonization, the territory started growing almost of coca per year. Several segments of Guaviare&#x27;s territory were controlled by drug traffickers and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC) guerrilla group during this period in which violence was widespread and clashes between the factions of the Colombian armed conflict were constant. According to Colombia&#x27;s Victims Unit, the conflict in Guaviare has had more than 93,000 victims since 1985, with more than 83,000 displaced and 6,612 dead.

The Colombian government&#x27;s efforts to fight against coca cultivation have faced several difficulties. Aerial aspersion of glyphosate over the coca crops was suspended by a judicial order as it was potentially risky for the health of the inhabitants. Additionally, plans to replace coca with other crops have encountered legal, environmental, and economic restrains that limit their viability. None of these crops could match the level of profit that coca provided. The introduction of cattle to the region has reduced the farmers&#x27; dependence on coca by generating alternative sources of income. However, deforestation caused by cattle-ranching has led to droughts, fires, and loss of biodiversity.

The demobilization of the FARC in 2016 has led to the improvement of the living conditions in rural areas of Guaviare, although FARC dissident groups that did not demobilize still exert territorial control of some zones of the department.

==Demographics==
=== Racial makeup ===

* Indigenous Latinos (90.09%)
* Afro-Colombians (5.86%)
* Amerindians or Indigenous (4.05%)

The Nukak, a nomadic tribe that was uncontacted until 1988, live in Guaviare.

<text>Alois Hitler (né Schicklgruber; 7 June 1837 – 3 January 1903) was an Austrian civil servant in the customs service, and the father of German dictator Adolf Hitler.

Alois Schicklgruber was born out of wedlock. His mother was Maria Schicklgruber, but his biological father remains unknown. This uncertain parentage has led to claims that Alois&#x27;s third wife, Klara (Adolf&#x27;s mother), may have also been either Alois&#x27;s first cousin once removed or his half-niece.

Alois married his first wife, Anna, in 1873. In 1876, Alois convinced the Austrian local authorities to acknowledge his deceased stepfather Johann Georg Hiedler as his biological father. This meant that Klara legally became Alois&#x27;s first cousin once removed. Alois then legally changed his last name to that of his deceased stepfather Johann, but the authorities misspelled the last name as &quot;Hitler&quot; for unknown reasons. 

Also in 1876, while Alois was still married to his first wife, Anna, he hired his relative Klara as a household servant, and began an affair with her. Their relationship continued in secrecy until Alois&#x27;s second wife, Franziska, died and Klara became pregnant, which prompted Alois to marry her in 1885. According to a close friend, Alois was &quot;awfully rough&quot; with his wife Klara and &quot;hardly ever spoke a word to her at home&quot;. Alois treated his children with similar contempt and often beat them.

==Early life==
Alois Hitler was born Alois Schicklgruber in the hamlet of Strones, a parish of Döllersheim in the Waldviertel of northwest Lower Austria; his mother was a 42-year-old unmarried peasant Maria Schicklgruber, whose family had lived in the area for generations. At his baptism in Döllersheim, the space for his father&#x27;s name on the baptismal certificate was left blank and the priest wrote &quot;illegitimate&quot;. His mother cared for Alois in a house she shared with her elderly father, Johannes Schicklgruber.

Sometime later, a man named Johann Georg Hiedler moved in with the Schicklgrubers. He married Maria when Alois was five, and Maria died when Alois was nine. By the age of 10, Alois had been sent to live with Johann Georg Hiedler&#x27;s younger brother, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, who owned a farm in the nearby village of Spital (south of Weitra). Alois attended elementary school and took lessons in shoemaking from a local cobbler. Growing up in the same household with Alois was Johanna, the mother of his future wife Klara.

At the age of 13, Alois left Johann Nepomuk Hiedler&#x27;s farm in Spital and went to Vienna as an apprentice cobbler, working there for about five years. In response to a recruitment drive by the Austrian government offering employment in the civil service to people from rural areas, Alois joined the frontier guards (customs service) of the Austrian Finance Ministry in 1855 at the age of 18.

===Uncertain identity of biological father===
Historians have proposed various candidates as Alois&#x27;s biological father: Johann Georg Hiedler, his younger brother Johann Nepomuk Hiedler (or &quot;Hüttler&quot;), and Leopold Frankenburger (a purportedly Jewish man, whose existence has never been found to be documented). Johann Georg Hiedler became the stepfather of five-year-old Alois and many years later, he was posthumously declared the legal birth father of Alois.

According to historian Frank McDonough, the most plausible theory is that Johann Georg Hiedler was actually the birth father. But the birth father may alternatively have been his younger brother Johann Nepomuk Hiedler. Regardless of how Nepomuk was related to Alois, if at all, Nepomuk was certainly the maternal grandfather of Alois&#x27;s third wife (Adolf Hitler&#x27;s mother) Klara.

Historian Werner Maser suggests that Alois&#x27;s biological father was not Johann Georg Hiedler, but rather Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, who raised Alois through adolescence and later willed to Alois a considerable portion of his life savings, although he never publicly admitted to being Alois&#x27;s natural father. According to Maser, Nepomuk was a married farmer who had an affair with Maria Schicklgruber and then arranged to have his single brother Johann Georg Hiedler marry Alois&#x27;s mother Maria to provide a cover for Nepomuk&#x27;s desire to assist and care for Alois without upsetting his wife. If the theory is true, then Alois&#x27;s third wife Klara was also Alois&#x27;s half-niece, but Adolf Hitler biographer Joachim Fest believes that any attempts to pin down whether Johann Georg Hiedler or Johann Nepomuk Hiedler was Alois&#x27;s father will &quot;peter out in the obscurity of confused relationships marked by meanness, dullness, and rustic bigotry&quot;.

In 1931 Adolf Hitler ordered the (SS) to investigate the rumors regarding his ancestry, and they found no evidence of any Jewish ancestors. After the Nuremberg Laws came into effect in Nazi Germany, Hitler ordered the genealogist Rudolf Koppensteiner to publish a large illustrated genealogical tree showing his ancestry. This was published in the book (&quot;The Pedigree of the Leader&quot;) in 1937 and purported to show that Hitler&#x27;s family were all Austrian Germans with no Jewish ancestry and that Hitler had an unblemished &quot;Aryan&quot; pedigree. Alois himself had claimed Johann Georg Hiedler was his biological father, and a priest accordingly amended Alois&#x27;s birth certificate in 1876, which was considered certified proof for Hitler&#x27;s ancestry; thus Hitler was considered a &quot;pure&quot; Aryan. Also in 1876, Alois hired 16-year-old Klara as a household servant.

Although Johann Georg Hiedler was considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler by the Third Reich, the question of who his grandfather really was has caused much speculation, and the answer remains unknown. As German historian Joachim Fest wrote:

Following the war, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s former lawyer, Hans Frank, claimed that Hitler told him in 1930 that one of his relatives was trying to blackmail him by threatening to reveal his alleged Jewish ancestry. Adolf Hitler asked Frank to find out the facts. Frank says he determined that at the time Maria Schicklgruber gave birth to Alois, she was working as a household cook in the town of Graz, that her employers were a Jewish family named Frankenberger, and that her child might have been conceived out of wedlock with the family&#x27;s 19-year-old son, Leopold Frankenberger.

Opponents of the Frankenberger thesis have asserted that all Jews had been expelled from the province of Styria – which includes Graz – in the 15th century by Maximilian I, and that they were not officially allowed to return until the 1860s, when Alois was around 30. Also, there is no evidence of a Frankenberger family living in Graz at that time. Scholars such as Ian Kershaw and Brigitte Hamann dismiss the Frankenberger hypothesis, which had only Frank&#x27;s speculation to support it, as baseless.

Kershaw cites several stories circulating in the 1920s about Hitler&#x27;s alleged Jewish ancestry, including one about a &quot;Baron Rothschild&quot; in Vienna in whose household Maria Schicklgruber had worked for some time as a servant. Kershaw discusses and also lists Hitler&#x27;s family tree in his biography of Adolf Hitler and gives no support to the Frankenberger tale. Hans Frank himself seemed skeptical about Hitler&#x27;s possible Jewish ancestry, saying &quot;The fact that Adolf Hitler had no Jewish blood in his veins, seems, from what has been his whole manner, so blatant to me that it needs no further word&quot;. Further, Frank&#x27;s story contains several inaccuracies and contradictions, such as the statement Frank made that Maria Schicklgruber came from &quot;Leonding near Linz&quot;, when in fact she came from the hamlet of Strones, near the village of Döllersheim.

In 2019, gender psychologist Leonard Sax published a paper title &quot;: revisiting the question of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s paternal grandfather&quot;. Sax claims that Hamann, Kershaw, and other leading historians relied, either directly or indirectly, on a single source for the claim that no Jews were living in Graz prior to 1856: that source was the Austrian historian Nikolaus von Preradovich, whom Sax showed was a fervent admirer of Adolf Hitler. Sax cited primary Austrian sources from the 1800s to demonstrate that there was in fact – &quot;a small, now settled community&quot; – of Jews living in Graz prior to 1856. Sax&#x27;s article has been picked up by a number of news outlets. 

Sax argued that one factor in Hitler&#x27;s extreme antisemitism was &quot;his intense need to prove&quot; that he was not Jewish. British historian Richard J. Evans dismissed Sax&#x27;s arguments and claims and stated: &quot;Even if there were Jews living in Graz in the 1830s, at the time when Adolf Hitler&#x27;s father Alois was born, this does not prove anything at all about the identity of Hitler&#x27;s paternal grandfather.&quot; Evans argued that speculation about Hitler&#x27;s ancestry persists &quot;because some people have found his deep and murderous anti-Semitism hard to explain unless there were personal motives behind it ... This seems to be the motivation for Dr. Leonard Sax, a psychiatrist, not a historian, making his claims&quot;.

Ron Rosenbaum suggests that Frank, who had turned against Nazism after 1945 but remained an anti-Semitic fanatic, made the claim that Hitler had Jewish ancestry as a way of proving that Hitler was a Jew and &quot;not&quot; an Aryan. A genetic study that collected DNA of 38 living relatives of Hitler concluded that, with high probability, Hitler&#x27;s genotype included the E1b1b DNA haplogroup. An author of the study stated:

==Career as customs official==
Schicklgruber was a Liberal, Pan-German and German nationalist, but was loyal to the Emperor of Austria. Initially Schicklgruber made steady progress in the semi-military profession of customs official. The work involved frequent reassignments and he served in a variety of places across Austria. By 1860, after five years of service, he reached the rank of &quot;Finanzwach-Oberaufseher&quot; (Revenue guard Senior warden, analogous to an Army Corporal). By 1864, after special training and examinations, Schicklgruber had advanced to &quot;provisorischer Amtsassistent&quot; (provisional Office assistant, analogous to a provisional Second lieutenant) and was serving in Linz, Austria. He later became a &quot;Zollamts-Official&quot; (Inspector of customs, i.e. (First) Lieutenant) posted at Braunau am Inn in 1875. Then his career suddenly came to a nearly dead end when it took him 17 years to get his last promotion. In 1892, he eventually rose to &quot;provisorischer&quot; resp., and in 1894 to &quot;definitiver Zolloberamts-Official&quot; (definite senior inspector of customs, i.e. Army captain). Schicklgruber (from 1877 under his new surname Hitler) could go no higher because he lacked the necessary school degrees.

===Change of surname===
As a rising young junior customs official, he used his birth name of Schicklgruber, but in mid-1876, 39 years old and well established in his career, he asked permission to use his stepfather&#x27;s family name. He appeared before the parish priest in Döllersheim and asserted that his father was Johann Georg Hiedler, who had married his mother and now wished to legitimize him. Three relatives appeared with him as witnesses, one of whom was Johann Nepomuk, Hiedler&#x27;s brother. The priest agreed to amend the birth certificate, the civil authorities automatically processed the church&#x27;s decision and Alois Schicklgruber had a new name. The official change, registered at the government office in Mistelbach in 1877, transformed him into &quot;Alois Hitler&quot;. It is not known who decided on the spelling of &quot;Hitler&quot; instead of &quot;Hiedler&quot;. Johann Georg&#x27;s brother was sometimes known by the surname &quot;Hüttler&quot;.

Historian Bradley F. Smith states that Alois Schicklgruber openly admitted having been born out of wedlock before and after the name change. Alois may have been influenced to change his name for the sake of legal expediency. Historian Werner Maser claims that in 1876, Franz Schicklgruber, the administrator of Alois&#x27;s mother&#x27;s estate and also an uncle of Alois, transferred a large sum of money (230 gulden) to him. Supposedly, Johann Georg Hiedler, who died in 1857, relented on his deathbed and left an inheritance to his illegitimate stepson (Alois) together with his surname. Some Schicklgrubers remain in the Waldviertel.

==Personal life==
===Illegitimate daughter===
In early 1869, Alois Hitler had an affair with Thekla Penz (born 24 September 1844) of Leopoldstein, Arbesbach, in the district of Zwettel, Lower Austria. This led to the birth of Theresia Penz on 31 October 1869. Thekla later married a man by the name of Horner, while Theresia married Johan Ramer.

===Early married life===
Alois Hitler was 36 years old in 1873 when he married for the first time. Anna Glasl-Hörer was a wealthy, 50-year-old daughter of a customs official. She was infirm when they married and was either an invalid or became one shortly afterwards. Not long after marrying his first wife, Alois began an affair with Franziska &quot;Fanni&quot; Matzelsberger, one of the young female servants employed at the Pommer Inn, house number 219, in the town Braunau am Inn, where he was renting the top floor as a lodging. Smith states that Alois had numerous affairs in the 1870s, resulting in his wife initiating legal action; on 7 November 1880, Alois and Anna separated by mutual agreement but remained married. The 19-year-old Matzelsberger became the 43-year-old Hitler&#x27;s mistress.

In 1876, four years before separating from Anna, he had hired Klara Pölzl as a household servant. She was the 16-year-old granddaughter of his step-uncle Nepomuk (who may also have been his biological father or uncle). If Nepomuk were Alois Hitler&#x27;s biological father then Klara was Alois&#x27;s half-niece; alternatively, if Johann Georg were Alois’s biological father, then Klara was Alois’s first cousin once removed. Matzelsberger demanded that the &quot;servant girl&quot; Klara find another job, and Hitler sent Klara Pölzl away.

On 13 January 1882, Matzelsberger gave birth to Hitler&#x27;s illegitimate son, also named Alois, but since they were not married, the child&#x27;s last name was Matzelsberger, making him &quot;Alois Matzelsberger&quot;. Alois Hitler kept Fanni Matzelsberger as his mistress while his lawful wife (Anna from whom he had separated) grew sicker and died on 6 April 1883. The next month, on 22 May at a ceremony in Braunau with fellow custom officials as witnesses, Alois, 45, married Matzelsberger, 21. He then legitimized his son as Alois Hitler Jr. The second child of Alois (Senior) and his wife Fanni was Angela, born on 28 July 1883.

Alois was secure in his profession and no longer an ambitious climber. Historian Alan Bullock described him as &quot;hard, unsympathetic and short-tempered&quot;. His wife Fanni, still only 23, acquired a lung disorder and became too ill to function. She was moved to Ranshofen, a small village near Braunau. During the last months of Fanni&#x27;s life, Klara Pölzl returned to Alois&#x27;s home to look after the invalid and the two children (Alois Jr. and Angela). Fanni Hitler, the second wife of Alois Hitler, died in Ranshofen on 10 August 1884 at the age of 23. After Fanni’s death, Klara Pölzl remained in his home as housekeeper.

===Marriage to Klara Pölzl and family life===
Pölzl was soon pregnant by Alois Hitler. Historian Bradley Smith writes that if Hitler had been free to do as he wished, he would have married Pölzl immediately in 1884, but because of the 1877 affidavit concerning his last name and paternity, Hitler was now legally Pölzl&#x27;s first cousin once removed, too close to marry. He submitted an appeal to the church for a humanitarian waiver.

Permission from Rome arrived, and on 7 January 1885 a wedding was held at Hitler&#x27;s rented rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn. A meal was served for the few guests and witnesses. Hitler then went to work for the rest of the day. Even Klara found the wedding to be a short ceremony. During their marriage, and consistent with Alois&#x27;s father perhaps being the same person as Klara’s maternal grandfather, Alois and Klara continued to address each other as &quot;uncle&quot; and &quot;niece&quot;.

On 17 May 1885, four months after the wedding, the new Frau Klara Hitler gave birth to her first child, Gustav. In 1886, she gave birth to a daughter, Ida. In 1887, Otto was born but died days later. During the winter of 1887–1888, diphtheria struck the Hitler household, resulting in the deaths of both Gustav (8 December) and Ida (2 January).

On 20 April 1889, she gave birth to another son, future dictator of Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler. Adolf was a sickly child, and his mother fretted over him. Alois was 51 when he was born, and had little interest in child-rearing; he left it all to his wife. When not at work he was either in a tavern or busy with his hobby, beekeeping. Alois was transferred from Braunau to Passau. He was 55, Klara 32, Alois Jr. 10, Angela 9, and Adolf was three years old.

Beginning on 1 August 1892, the family lived at Theresienstrasse 23 in Passau. One month after Alois accepted a better-paying position in Linz, on 1 April 1893 his wife and the children moved to a second floor room at Kapuzinerstrasse 31 in Passau. Klara had just given birth to Edmund, so it was decided she and the children would stay in Passau for the time being. On 21 January 1896, Paula, Adolf&#x27;s younger sister, was born. She was the last child of Alois Hitler and Klara Pölzl. Alois was often home with his family. He had five children ranging in age from infancy to 14. Edmund (the youngest of the boys) died of measles on 2 February 1900.

Alois wanted his son Adolf to seek a career in the civil service. However, Adolf had become so alienated from his father that he was repulsed by his wishes. He sneered at the thought of a lifetime spent enforcing petty rules. Alois tried to browbeat his son into obedience, while Adolf did his best to be the opposite of whatever his father wanted.

Robert G. L. Waite noted, &quot;Even one of his closest friends admitted that Alois was &#x27;awfully rough&#x27; with his wife [Klara] and &#x27;hardly ever spoke a word to her at home&#x27;.&quot; If Alois was in a bad mood, he picked on the older children or Klara herself, in front of them. Alois&#x27;s grandson, William Patrick Hitler said that he had heard from his father, Alois Jr., that Alois Hitler Sr. used to beat his children. After Hitler and his eldest son Alois Jr. had a climactic and violent argument, Alois Jr. left home, and the elder Alois swore he would never give the boy a penny of inheritance beyond what the law required. According to reports, Alois Hitler liked to lord it over his neighbors, and even beat his own family’s dog until it would wet the floor.

Alois has been described as &quot;an authoritarian, overbearing, domineering husband and a stern, masterful, and often irritable father&quot; and as a &quot;strict, short-tempered patriarch who demanded unquestioning respect and obedience from his children and used the switch whenever his expectations were not met.&quot;

==Retirement and death==

In February 1895, Alois Hitler purchased a house on a plot in Hafeld near Lambach, approximately southwest of Linz. The farm was called the &quot;Rauscher Gut&quot;. He moved his family to the farm and retired on 25 June 1895 at the age of 58, after 40 years in the customs service.

On the morning of 3 January 1903, Alois went to the Gasthaus Wiesinger (no. 1 Michaelsbergstrasse, Leonding) as usual to drink his morning glass of wine. He was offered the newspaper and promptly collapsed. He was taken to an adjoining room and a doctor was summoned, but he died at the inn, probably from a pleural hemorrhage. Adolf Hitler, who was 13 when his father died, wrote in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; that he died of a &quot;stroke of apoplexy&quot;. In his book, &quot;The Young Hitler I Knew&quot;, Hitler&#x27;s childhood friend August Kubizek recalled, &quot;When the fourteen-year-old (sic) son saw his dead father, he burst out into uncontrollable weeping.&quot;

===Removal of tombstone===

On 28 March 2012, by the account of Kurt Pittertschatscher, the pastor of the parish, the tombstone marking Alois Hitler&#x27;s grave and that of his wife Klara was removed. The decision was made by a descendant of the family, according to the local mayor Walter Brunner. The descendant is said to be &quot;an elderly female relative of Alois Hitler&#x27;s first wife, Anna&quot;. The removal was welcomed by local authorities, due to issues with the upkeep of the grave, as well as the fact that the grave was being &quot;misused for gatherings of sympathisers&quot;. In 2011, for example, a vase with the word &quot;unvergesslich&quot; (unforgettable), with the two s-letters marked in the style of the doppelte Siegrune associated with the SS was left at the site. &quot;The Upper Austrian Network Against Fascism&quot; also approved of the removal, calling it a &quot;welcome success&quot;, with Robert Eiter from the organization commenting that &quot;a lot of flowers and wreaths were deposited there from people who clearly were admirers&quot;.

Since the rights to the burial plot have relinquished, it can now be re-assigned. A stonemason was employed to remove the old headstone, and the plot was covered in white gravel and a tree, which has since been removed. It is not known whether the remains of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s parents are still interred there.

<text>The Shadow Rising is a fantasy novel by American author Robert Jordan, the fourth book in his series &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;. It was published by Tor Books and released on September 15, 1992. The unabridged audio book is read by Michael Kramer and Kate Reading.

At 393,823 words, &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot; is the longest book of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; while featuring fewer pages than &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;. &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot; consists of 58 chapters. It is the only book in the main sequence of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; not to contain a prologue, although its first chapter fulfills much the same narrative purpose.

==Plot summary==
Rand al&#x27;Thor has just claimed the crystal sword &quot;Callandor&quot; to prove himself the Dragon Reborn. He is approached by Lanfear who tells him of the Forsaken&#x27;s plans. The fortress known as the Stone of Tear is stormed by Trollocs and Fades, sent by another Forsaken (Sammael), while a third, Semirhage, sends her followers into the Stone to oppose Sammael&#x27;s forces. In defense, Rand uses &quot;Callandor&quot; to create a lightning storm killing all the Trollocs and Fades.

Rand then decides that he must travel to the Aiel Waste, to be acknowledged as the Aiel&#x27;s prophesied leader. Before leaving, Rand, Mat Cauthon and Moiraine Damodred visit a &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; that lets them talk to a mysterious snakelike race called the Aelfinn, who seemingly know the answer to any question. Mat learns from them that he must go to Rhuidean or die and also that he is destined to marry someone called &quot;the Daughter of the Nine Moons&quot;. Egwene al&#x27;Vere and the Aiel woman Aviendha are summoned to the Aiel Waste, Egwene to learn Dreamwalking and Aviendha to become a Wise One. Thus, Rand, Mat, Moiraine, Egwene, and Aviendha all travel to the Aiel Waste.

Other characters in the Stone of Tear also learn that they must travel elsewhere. Perrin Aybara hears of trouble in The Two Rivers, his native region, and returns there accompanied by Faile Bashere, Loial and three Aiel warriors: Gaul, Bain and Chiad. Elayne Trakand, Nynaeve al&#x27;Meara, and Thom Merrilin depart to Tarabon to hunt the Black Ajah. Finally, Min Farshaw arrives in Tar Valon to report to the Amyrlin Siuan Sanche. Moving forward, &quot;The Shadow Rising&quot; follows four groups of characters in four plotlines.

===Aiel Waste===
Rand uses a portal stone to transport Mat, Egwene, Moiraine, and the Aiel from the Stone of Tear to the Aiel Waste, and are met by Taardad and Shaido Aiel.

Moiraine, Aviendha, Mat and Rand enter Rhuidean, the legendary forbidden city of the waste, where each enters a &quot;ter&#x27;angreal.&quot;

While inside his &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot;, Rand relives portions of his paternal ancestors lives (before and after the Breaking) and discovers the Aiel were once pacifists serving the Aes Sedai. Adherence to pacifism still lives on in the Tinkers, while others known as the &#x27;Jenn Aiel&#x27; transported a large collection of &quot;angreal&quot;, &quot;sa&#x27;angreal&quot; and &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; to Rhuidean. Rand emerges from the &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; with dragon markings on both arms; proof that he is the &quot;Car&#x27;a&#x27;carn&quot;, the &#x27;Chief of Chiefs&#x27; of the Aiel.

Mat enters his &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; seeking more answers from the &#x27;Aelfinn&#x27;. Instead, he encounters the foxlike &#x27;Eelfinn&#x27; who bargain for gifts versus answering questions. Mat ignorantly requests several gifts from them: fluency in the Old Tongue, memories of his own ancestors, a spear called an &quot;ashandarei&quot;, and a medallion &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; that protects against the One Power. Afterwards Rand finds Mat hanging from the Tree of Life (the price for the gifts he received). After his revival by Rand, Mat dons a black scarf to hide the scars around his neck.

Moiraine visits the three-hooped &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; used by the Wise Ones, gaining limited knowledge of the future.

The Wise Ones task Aviendha with teaching Rand the Aiel customs as they travel to Cold Rocks Hold. They are met en route by Darkfriends and the Forsaken Lanfear and Asmodean disguised as merchants. After arrival at &quot;Al&#x27;cair Dal&quot;, both Rand al&#x27;Thor and Couladin of the Shaido Aiel claim to be the messiah &#x27;He Who Comes With the Dawn&#x27;. To validate his claim, Rand reveals the secret history of the Aiel during the Age of Legends, but this incites an uproar among the Aiel. Rand prevents a riot by summoning a rainstorm to the Aiel Waste. Asmodean uses the momentary in-fighting amongst the Aiel as cover to seek out the &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot; access keys to the Choedan Kal (the most powerful &quot;sa&#x27;angreal&quot; ever created).

Rand chases Asmodean to Rhuidean where both simultaneously grasp the access key. The sudden power surge enables Rand to sever Asmodean&#x27;s link to the Dark One (which marks Asmodean as a traitor to the rest of the Forsaken). Asmodean begrudgingly relents to teach Rand how to channel the One Power after Lanfear hobbles Asmodean&#x27;s own access to it. Rand returns to Al&#x27;cair Dal to find most of the Aiel acknowledging him as the Car&#x27;a&#x27;carn.

===The Two Rivers===
Padan Fain drives the Children of the Light to the Two Rivers to exact vengeance on Rand.

The Shadow deploys Slayer, a mysterious and powerful agent together with a large host of Trollocs to kill Fain, endangering the Two Rivers.

Perrin&#x27;s homecoming is dashed with tragedy when he learns Trollocs have killed his family. Perrin rallies new allies; Verin Mathwin, Alanna Mosvani, Aes Sedai searching for potential pupils, and the Tinker Aram (who has abandoned his people&#x27;s pacifism) to fight the Trollocs. It is revealed later that Fain killed Perrin&#x27;s family.

With the help of Tam al&#x27;Thor (Rand&#x27;s adoptive father) and Abell Cauthon (Mat&#x27;s father), Perrin convinces the people of the Two Rivers to fight for themselves. Perrin leads them against the Trollocs and earns the nicknames &#x27;Lord Perrin&#x27; and &#x27;Perrin Goldeneyes.&#x27;

Before the showdown with the Trollocs, Perrin marries Faile and tasks her with travelling to Caemlyn and asking Queen Morgase to lend soldiers in their fight.

The Children of the Light, led by Dain Bornhald, interject themselves and demand Perrin&#x27;s arrest to try him for the murders of other whitecloaks. Perrin agrees to give himself up if the Children will fight alongside the Two Rivers when the Trollocs attack.

Slayer is killing wolves in &quot;Tel&#x27;aran&#x27;rhiod&quot; but retreats when he is attacked and defeated by Perrin.

Despite their loss of Perrin, the Trollocs are defeated by the Two Rivers forces. The Children of the Light reneged on their agreement and sat out the battle, so Perrin and the Two Rivers folk force the Children to leave.

With his plans ruined, Fain departs for the White Tower.

===Tanchico in Tarabon===
Nynaeve and Elayne, along with Thom Merrilin and Juilin Sandar, are taken to Tanchico by the Sea Folk who reveal their own prophecies about Rand.

They meet Bayle Domon and Seanchan woman Egeanin. During their mission to smoke out the Black Ajah they also encounter Moghedien, one of the Forsaken. They discover that the enemy&#x27;s goal is a male &quot;a&#x27;dam&quot;, held in the private collection of the Panarch Amathera, which they plan to use to control Rand.

Nynaeve and Elayne save Amathera from the Black Ajah and take the &quot;a&#x27;dam&quot; and a seal on the Dark One&#x27;s prison from her palace.

Moghedien attacks and personally duels Nynaeve, finding that they are roughly equal in power. Nynaeve defeats Moghedien and shields her, but the Black Ajah cause a distraction with a balefire-creating &quot;ter&#x27;angreal&quot;, letting Moghedien escape. Finally, they send Domon and Egeanin to destroy the &quot;a&#x27;dam&quot;.

===White Tower===
Min continues to report to the Amyrlin and tries to avoid suspicion by taking the guise of Elmindreda, a giddy, empty-headed woman. She finds herself caught in a coup where Elaida and her supporters depose Siuan and Leane Sharif, her Keeper of the Chronicles, for secretly aiding Rand.

Siuan and Leane are both &quot;stilled&quot; (their ability to channel the One Power severed) and Elaida becomes the next Amyrlin.

Min frees Siuan and Leane, and all three are assisted in escape by Gawyn Trakand. Gawyn has joined the coup on Elaida&#x27;s side, and killed several Siuan supporters, but Min convinces him to turn a blind eye to their escape as a personal favor to her. Logain Ablar, a former False Dragon who has been &quot;gentled&quot; (the male equivalent of &quot;stilling&quot;) joins their escape from Tar Valon.

<text>Huila () is one of the departments of Colombia. It is located in the southwest of the country, and its capital is Neiva.

== Demography and Ethnography ==
Huila department had a population of 1,122,622 inhabitants in 2020, of which 679,667 (60.54%) live in urban areas and 442,955 (39.46%) in the rest of the &quot;Huilense&quot; territory. This amounts to 2.5% of the total Colombian population. The majority of it is settled in the Magdalena valley, the main urban centers being Neiva and Garzón, due to the possibilities offered by commercial-type agricultural economy, oil production, access to basic public services and roads connected to the central road axis along the Magdalena. The rest of the population is located on the coffee belt, standing out Pitalito and La Plata; the North Subregion is undergoing a decrease in its rural population, mainly attributable to alterations of agricultural and oil activities on the landscape. The average population density in the department is 59.88 inhabitants / km2, with the highest densities in Neiva (223.72), Pitalito (200.1) and Garzón (162.45), and with the lowest in the municipalities of Colombia and Villavieja (7.83 and 10.91 respectively).

=== Ethnography ===
According to DANE, the racial composition of Huila is as follows: 98.43% recognize themselves as Whites and Mestizos, while only 1.57% as an ethnic population (Amerindians and Afro/Mulattos). This makes it one of departments with the highest percentage of non-ethnic affiliated population in the country.

==Geography==
According to the Agustín Codazzi Geographic Institute (IGAC), Huila&#x27;s surface area is 19,890 km², which is about 1.74% of the total surface area of Colombia.

The south of the department is located in the Colombian Massif. The Cordillera Oriental branches off from the Colombia Massif here. This is caused by the rise of the Magdalena River (also called Yuma River), Colombia&#x27;s longest river and its largest basin. The Magdalena River has two large dams: Betania and El Quimbo.

Colombia&#x27;s third highest peak, Nevado del Huila volcano, is also located in this department.

<doc id="549691" wikidata="Q5176530" url="?curid=549691" title="Council of governments">
<text>Councils of governments (CoGs—also known as regional councils, regional commissions, regional planning commissions, and planning districts) are regional governing and/or coordinating bodies that exist throughout the United States. CoGs are normally controlled by their member local governments, though some states have passed laws granting CoGs region-wide powers over specific functions, and still other states mandate such councils.

==Organization and function==
CoG members are drawn from the county, city, and other government bodies within its area. CoGs can offer planning, coordination, and technical assistance to their members, administer programs at a regional level, and act as intermediaries between the local government members and the state or federal government. A typical council is defined to serve an area of several counties, and addresses issues such as regional and municipal planning, economic, and community development, pollution control, transit administration, transportation planning, human services, and water use. Councils of governments also play a role in regional hazard mitigation and emergency planning and in the collection, analysis, distribution of demographic and cartographic/GIS data.

==Federal transportation planning==
CoGs may either be distinct from—or encompass—regional Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and Rural Transportation Planning Organizations (RTPOs). MPOs are multi-governmental urban transportation planning entities that arose out of the requirements of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962, which made federal financing for urban transportation projects contingent upon the existence of a &quot;continuing, comprehensive, urban transportation planning process undertaken cooperatively by the states and local governments&quot;. RTPOs are bodies similar to, and inspired by the model of MPOs, but organized for rural areas. Though RTPOs existed for decades, they were only formally recognized by on a federal level by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) of 2012. Of the 556 CoGs in the US, 165 operate an associated MPO, and 265 operate an associated RTPO.

==History==
Though voluntary non-profit regional organizations had existed for several decades before, CoGs in their modern form began in 1947, with the Atlanta Regional Metropolitan Planning Commission, followed by the Northern Virginia Regional Planning Commission in December of the same year. By 1950, there were 18 CoG/regional planning organizations in the US, and by 1953, the number of such bodies had increased on 40. CoGs saw explosive growth during the 1960s and 1970s, driven by federal and state funding incentives and mandates. At present, the National Association of Regional Councils estimates that currently &quot;of the 39,000 local, general purpose governments in the United States (counties, cities, townships, towns, villages, boroughs) a total of more than 35,000 are served by [CoGs]&quot;.

== By state ==

There are some U.S. states with many councils of government:

* Councils of governments in California
*Councils of governments in Connecticut
*Councils of governments in North Carolina

==Councils of CoGs==
Several national organizations exist to serve the needs (and lobby for the interests of) regional CoGs. These include the National Association of Regional Councils (formerly the National Service to Regional Councils), the National Association of Development Organizations, and the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations.

Similar associations (most voluntary, but some state-mandated) also exist at the state level. They include:
*California Association of Councils of Government 
*Michigan Association of Regions
*New York State Association of Regional Councils
*Northern Arizona Council of Governments
*Texas Association of Regional Councils
*Virginia Association of Planning District Commissions

<text>Meta () is a department of Colombia. It is close to the geographic center of the country, to the east of the Andean mountains. A large portion of the department, which is also crossed by the Meta River, is covered by a grassland plain known as the Llanos. Its capital is Villavicencio. The department has a monument placed in the very geographic centre of Colombia, at a place known as Alto de Menegua, a few kilometers from Puerto López.

Achagua, which is similar to Piapoco, is an Indigenous language spoken by a minority in the department.

<doc id="549702" wikidata="Q230217" url="?curid=549702" title="Nariño Department">
<text>Nariño () is a department of Colombia named after independence leader Antonio Nariño. Its capital is Pasto. It is in the west of the country, bordering Ecuador and the Pacific Ocean. 

Nariño has a diverse geography and varied climate according to altitude: hot in the plains of the Pacific and cold in the mountains, where most of the population resides, a situation that is repeated in a north-south direction. Other important cities include Tumaco and Ipiales.

==History==

The territory was occupied during the Pre-Columbian era by numerous Indian tribes, including Quillacingas, Awá, Pasto, and Tumas. The first European conquistador who entered the territory was Andagoya Pascual in 1522, who traveled from the Colombian Pacific coast and then used information obtained by Francisco Pizarro to organize the expedition that culminated in the conquest of Peru.

Juan de Ampudia and Pedro de Añazco first explored the mountainous part of the department, commissioned by Sebastián de Belalcázar in 1535, who then toured the territory in 1536 and reached Popayán and remained for some time before leaving for Spain.

<text>Zakros ( also Zakro or Kato Zakro) is a Minoan archaeological site on the eastern coast of Crete in Lasithi, Greece. It is regarded as one of the six Minoan palaces, and its protected harbor and strategic location made it an important commercial hub for trade to the east.

The town was dominated by the Palace of Zakro, originally built around 1900 BC, rebuilt around 1600 BC, and destroyed around 1450 BC along with the other major centers of Minoan civilization. Extensive ruins of the palace remain, and are a popular tourist destination.

Zakros is sometimes divided into &quot;Epano Zakros&quot; (&quot;Upper Zakros&quot;), the portion higher up on the hillside, and &quot;Kato Zakros&quot; (&quot;Lower Zakros&quot;), the part near the sea. A Minoan villa was discovered on the road from Epano Zakos near the gorge. It is dated to the Minoan LM IA period (c. 1700–1625 BC), before the construction of the palace. A pithos found there had a Linear A inscription around its rim recording a large quantity (32 units) of wine. A ravine (usually referred to as a gorge in archaeological publications) known as the &quot;Ravine of the Dead&quot; runs through both the upper and lower parts of the ancient site, named after the numerous burials that have been found in the caves along its walls.

==History==

The site was first occupied in the Early Minoan III to Middle Minoan IA period (c. 2000 BC). The monumental construction at the site proceeded in two phases. The Old Palace was built late in the Middle Minoan period and then destroyed by a large seismic event c. 1700 BC. At that point the New Palace was constructed. It was destroyed in another seismic event c. 1450 BC (between the Late Minoan IA and Late Minoan IB periods). There was a limited degree of occupation which then ceased entirely c. 1200 BC (Late Minoan III period). A 3 meter wide slab paved guttered road, built during the ProtoPalatial period, connected Kato Zakros and its harbor. It led to the northeast gate of the palace. During the Minoan era the sea level dropped 4 times (−4.00 ± 0.30 m, −2.85 ± 0.30 m, −1.25 ± 0.05 m, and −0.50 ± 0.05 m), or the land rose, of major significance to a harbor city. To the north a large Protopalatial and Neopalatial town occupied the hills around the palace. The town, like the palace, was laid out with a rectilinear paved road system. Based on the road width and lack of wheel wear it is assumed that transport was by pack animals.

It has been proposed that the ancient name of the site was Ditka.

==Archaeology==

The site was first recorded by Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt in 1851.

The site was visited by Arthur Evans, excavator of Knossos, in 1894 and 1896. Zakro was excavated by D. G. Hogarth of the British School of Archaeology at Athens under the auspices of the Cretan Exploration Fund in 1901 working primarily in the central area, Ayios Antonios. Finds included bronze tools, pottery, loom weights, furniture, and a winepress (7 have now been found in total, all in the town area). In a stone cellar in one of the 12 homes excavated on the hill to the northeast a small horde of bronze implements was found including two axe heads and three lances. Some of the pottery from later contexts was of Mycenaean Greek type. Some small sites (Xerokambolina, Ambelis, Anthropolites, Tou Koukou to Kephali, and S&#x27; tas Tavernas) in the upper Zakros Valley near Espano Zakros were also examined. Two pits were excavated by Hogarth, the primary one being 16 feet in diameter and 18 feet deep with a deposit of 8 feet in depth at the bottom (with the top 3 feet disturbed by looting villagers). Artifacts, primarily pottery, found in the pit date to the LM IA period. A single Linear A inscribed roundel (3.00 by 2.80 by 1.20 centimeters) was found, in the same deposit with a Linear A tablet and a number of clay sealings. Three of the sealings were inscribed with Cretan hieroglyphs. The deposit was in a destruction layer dated between layers LM IA and LM IB. Human remains were found in caves at the gorge.
In 1961, Nikolaos Platon resumed the excavation and discovered the Palace of Zakro (the New Palace). The palace (or administrative center), with an area of about 8000 square meters and with about 150 rooms, featured two large paved courtyards, one central and one to the west. His work there continued until he died in 1992 and appears to have then been continued by Lefteris Plato. Much of the focus of excavation was on the slope northeast of the palace including the &quot;Strong Building&quot;, &quot;Little Tower Building&quot;, and the &quot;Pottery Stores Building&quot;. During excavation an irrigation project to the west of the site revealed Middle Minoan tomb enclosures at Pezoules Kephala. Two enclosures were excavated, one a single tomb and one a multi-chambered tomb. Articulated skeletons were recovered and later examined. This site has yielded several clay tablets with Linear A inscriptions. Copper oxhide ingots dated to LM IA were found. One Egyptian stonebridge‑spouted jar which had been locally modified was found.
A number of seals, mainly of steatite, and clay sealings have been found at Zakros. Two Egyptian Early Dynastic bowls were found in the cult repository of the Palace. It is thought that they stemmed from the widespread trade in robbed Egyptian tomb artifacts in that period. Zakros is the second largest source of recovered Linear A inscriptions, after Haghia Triada. In total 591 documents were found consisting of 31 tablets and 560 sealed documents.

Many of the excavated artifacts are housed at the Heraklion Archaeological Museum. Some items, given to Hogarth by the Cretan government, are housed at the Ashmolean Museum.

<doc id="549710" wikidata="Q254451" url="?curid=549710" title="Cecilia Gallerani">
<text>Cecilia Gallerani (; early 1473 – 1536) was the favourite and most celebrated of the many mistresses of Ludovico Sforza, known as Lodovico il Moro, Duke of Milan. She is best known as the subject of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s painting &quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot; (). While posing for the painting, she invited Leonardo, who at the time was working as court artist for Sforza, to meetings at which Milanese intellectuals discussed philosophy and other subjects. Gallerani herself presided over these discussions.

== Family and early life ==
Cecilia was born in early 1473 into a large family from Siena. Her father&#x27;s name was Fazio Gallerani. He was not a member of the nobility, but he occupied several important posts at the Milanese court, including the position of ambassador to Republic of Florence and Republic of Lucca. Her mother was Margherita Busti, the daughter of a noted doctor of law.

She was educated alongside her six brothers in Latin and literature. In 1483 at the age of ten, Cecilia was betrothed to Stefano Visconti, but the betrothal was broken off in 1487 for unknown reasons. In May 1489, she left home for the Monastero Nuovo, and it was possibly there that she met Ludovico.

== Mistress of Ludovico Sforza ==
Gallerani was a lifelong scholar with a musical gift and love of poetry, which she composed in Latin and Italian. She became a mistress of the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza &quot;il Moro&quot; when she was 16 or 18 and enjoyed entertaining the intellectual elite out of her apartments in his Milanese castle and seat of the ducal court at the Porta Giovia. It is supposed that she was Sforza&#x27;s preferred partner but too low in social rank to be a politically acceptable match; after their son Cesare was born on 3 May 1491, Sforza continued to provide for the family with palatial homes, an arranged marriage for Gallerani with an Italian count, and senior church appointments for Cesare in Milan. 

Gallerani and son continued to live in Castello Sforza for up to a year, around when the duke&#x27;s long-negotiated marriage to a daughter of the Duke of Ferrara (and niece of the Queen of Hungary) could be celebrated. The 16-year-old Duchess Beatrice d&#x27;Este discovered the liaison and insisted on their removal. They were first installed in the Verme Palace until Gallerani was given a palace in Carmagnola in 1492, when she married the son of a duke of the House of Carminati who had pledged service to Sforza.

===&quot;Lady with an Ermine&quot;===

Although at times the details have been disputed, Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s famous lifelike portrait is considered by experts to be of Cecilia Gallerani while she still lived in Castello Sforzeco; in 1992 Shell and Sironi concluded it to have been painted around 1490 by cross-referencing and correcting the interpretation of contemporaneous evidence. Da Vinci was the Castello Sforza court artist and engineer, yet it is believed he never painted the Duchess, which could mean she refused her own sitting on the basis of insult relating to the mistress. (He later painted other mistresses and the second wife of Sforza.) Da Vinci used the ermine/stoat as a symbol of purity in his works and wrote about its meaning. But other theories on its meaning include that it is a play on Cecilia&#x27;s last name and the Greek word for the animal (gallay) and/or an emblem of Sforza, whose sobriquet became &#x27;l&#x27;Ermellino&#x27; after being awarded the Order of the Ermine by the King of Naples. Art critics have noted that the skulls and hands/paws of the two figures are remarkably similar and these subtle details not only a testament to the skill of Da Vinci but also a hint at symbolism. 

The academic disagreements over the year and subject of the painting (but not its authenticity) owe to a lack of artifacts describing the work before its purchase in 1800 by Polish Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski as a gift to his mother Princess Isabella. But correspondence exists about a portrait of Gallerani once borrowed by Isabella d&#x27;Este who was herself a known admirer of da Vinci&#x27;s artwork. In her reply to the request, Gallerani said it no longer looked like her because she had been so young then and &quot;nobody seeing it and me together would suppose it was made for me&quot;. &quot;Though reluctant because it no longer resembled her, Cecilia complied, and by the following month the picture was gratefully returned&quot;.

== Later life, death, and legacy ==
The Countess and Count Ludovico &quot;Il Bergamino&quot; were given a palace, as their wedding gift by Duke Sforza in 1492. They had five children. After the deaths of both her son in 1512 and husband in 1515, she retired to San Giovanni in Croce, a castle near Cremona that had been enfeoffed to the Count&#x27;s father by the Duke.

Gallerani died on an unknown date in 1536. She was purportedly buried in the Carminati family tomb in the Church of San Zavedro in San Giovanni in Croce.

Bandello described her as a patron of the arts. According to others, her salon was the first in Europe.

== Issue ==
By her lover Ludovico Sforza, she had a son: 

* Cesare Sforza (3 May 1493 – 4 January 1514), a cleric who was made the abbot of the Church of San Nazaro Maggiore of Milan in 1498 and became canon of Milan in 1505.

By her husband, she had four sons and a daughter: 

* Giovan Pietro, Earl of San Giovanni in Croce; he married Bona Monastirolo, daughter of Lucrezia Crivelli (another former mistress of Ludovico Sforza) and her husband; 
* Girolamo;
* Francesco; in 1534 he married Isabella Sforza (1503–1561), natural daughter of Giovanni Sforza, but the marriage was declared &quot;nullius&quot; for &quot;spiritual relative&quot; (his mother was Isabella&#x27;s godmother); he later married Ludovica Secca;
* Ascanio;
* Maria Felice; she married Anchise Visconti d&#x27;Aragona, lord of Oleggio Castello.

== Cultural references ==
The Leonardo portrait of Gallerani plays an important role in the plot of the alternative historical novel &quot;Fatherland&quot; by Robert Harris. In the novel, the painting is misappropriated by corrupt Nazi officials during World War II. The book&#x27;s epilogue states that in real life, the portrait &quot;was recovered from Germany at the end of the war and returned to Poland.&quot;

The portrait also takes center stage in the novel &quot;The Night Portrait&quot; by Laura Morelli. The novel splits timelines between the late 1400s to depict Leonardo painting the portrait, and the 1940s, as the Nazis and the &quot;Monument Men&quot; contend over the painting.

<text>Putumayo () is a department of Southern Colombia. It is in the south-west of the country, bordering Ecuador and Peru. Its capital is Mocoa.

The word &quot;putumayo&quot; comes from the Quechua languages. The verb &quot;p&#x27;utuy&quot; means &quot;to spring forth&quot; or &quot;to burst out&quot;, and &quot;mayu&quot; means river. Thus it means &quot;gushing river&quot;.

==History==

Originally, the southwestern area of the department belonged to the Cofán Indians, the northwestern to the Kamentxá Indians, the central and southern areas to tribes that spoke Tukano languages (such as the Siona), and the eastern to tribes that spoke Witoto languages. Part of the Kamentxá territory was conquered by the Inca Huayna Cápac in 1492, who, after crossing the Cofán territory, established a Quechua population on the valley of Sibundoy, known today as Ingas. After the Inca defeat in 1533, the region was invaded by the Spanish in 1542, and from 1547 was administered by Catholic missions.

The current territory of Putumayo was linked to Popayan during the Spanish Colonial Period and in the first Republican decades belonged to the &quot;Azuay Department&quot;, which included territories in Ecuador and Perú. Later a long process of territorial redistributions began:

* 1831: Popayán Province.
* 1857: Estado Federal del Cauca.
* 1886: Cauca Department.
* 1905: .
* 1909: .
* 1912: Comisaría Especial del Putumayo.
* 1953: Department of Nariño.
* 1957: Comisaría Especial del Putumayo.
* 1968: Intendencia Especial del Putumayo.
* 1991: Putumayo Department.

<doc id="549713" wikidata="Q1138197" url="?curid=549713" title="Cowes Week">
<text>Cowes Week ( ) is one of the longest-running regular regattas in the world. With 40 daily sailing races, around 500 boats, and 2500 competitors ranging from Olympic and world-class professionals to weekend sailors, it is the largest sailing regatta of its kind in the world. Having started in 1826, the event is held in August each year on the Solent (the area of water between southern England and the Isle of Wight made tricky by strong double tides), and is run by Cowes Week Limited in the small town of Cowes on the Isle of Wight.

==Description==
Cowes Week is held at the beginning of August, set after Glorious Goodwood in the social calendar, which in most years means from the first Saturday after the last Tuesday in July, until the following Friday. It is occasionally moved to another week if the state of the tides in the normal week is unfavourable or, as in 2012, to avoid a clash with the Olympic Games. The regatta was famous for its fireworks on the final Friday, however there has not been a display since 2019. The display had taken place on the final Friday of the event since the early days and was an iconic finale.

Typically Cowes Week up to forty starts a day for classes of cruiser-racers, one designs and keelboats; around 500 boats and 2,500 competitors take part. During this time the Solent, which is a busy commercial waterway, is filled with boats of all classes and is particularly colourful due to the spinnakers (the large rounded sail hoisted at the front of a yacht when running downwind). The different classes of boats are split into either White Group (dayboats) and Black Group (larger boats with cabins).

As well as the sailing activities, the week includes a large number of onshore events including live music and cocktail parties. Marquees are erected in the marinas serving food and drink, and the crowds overflow from busy public houses and restaurants around the narrow high street – the town becomes a hive of activity into the early hours of each morning. Around 100,000 visitors are attracted to Cowes by the festival atmosphere of the event each year in addition to all the competitors.

From 1995 to 2008 its official title was Skandia Cowes Week, named after title sponsor Skandia the Swedish financial services group. From 2011 to 2016 its official title was Aberdeen Asset Management Cowes Week, named after the title sponsor. For 2017 and 2018 the event was known as Lendy Cowes Week, after Lendy Limited took over title sponsorship. In 2019, Lendy ceased to be title sponsors. Other supporters include Communications Sponsor aql.

==History==

The festival originates from the Prince Regent&#x27;s interest in yachting which continued after he became George IV in 1820. The first race started at 09:30 on Thursday 10 August 1826 with the prize of a &quot;Gold Cup of the value of £100&quot; and was held under the flag of the Royal Yacht Club, which later became the Royal Yacht Squadron. Another race was held the next day for prize money only (£30 for first place, £20 for second).

Until World War I, big cutters and raters were raced by gentlemen amateurs employing skippers and crew. In the 1920s and 1930s, there were cruiser handicap classes and local one-designs (although the six to eight and twelve metre classes attracted the most racing interest). Following World War II, when there was a revival of big yacht racing, ocean racing classes started to predominate, especially after the first Admiral&#x27;s Cup event was held in 1957 and the growth in popularity of the two ocean-going races that start and finish the regatta &quot;The Channel&quot; and &quot;the Fastnet&quot;. The Fastnet, which rounds the Fastnet rock far out in the Atlantic and can be dangerous, is held in odd-numbered years only.

In the decades following World War II, yachting moved away from its image as a rich man&#x27;s sport to one which is enjoyed by many today in modest self-skippered 30 to 40 foot yachts. The attraction of Cowes Week has also given life to many water-based activities and sailing schools promoting the sport of sailing to all age groups and walks of life. Although certain functions in the week are still the preserve of the elite or members-only clubs, Cowes Week encompasses a wide range of events and attractions open to the public, marketed to a very diverse range of interests.

Key shoreside events of Cowes Week include the festivities within Cowes Yacht Haven, on Cowes Parade and at Shepards Wharf Marina. Each of these venues offer entertainment for the general public as well as those racing.

Traditionally at the end of the Cowes Week event, a fireworks display is held. This has occurred for more than 150 years. In recent years contributions to the funding of the display have been requested by the community who enjoy and benefit from them.

In 2012 Mrs Gillian Smith became the first female Principal Race Officer to oversee the racing.

==Major trophies==

&quot;The Queen&#x27;s Cup&quot; was presented to the Royal Southampton Yacht Club by Queen Victoria in 1897, her Diamond Jubilee year. Eleven boats entered the first Queen&#x27;s Cup race on 9 August 1897. It was won by Latana, a 165-ton yawl owned by Mr W M Johnstone, by far the biggest boat in the race. The Cup was subsequently raced for on the opening day of Cowes Week but, shortly after the turn of the 20th century, it was mysteriously lost. Re-discovered in 1937 in a second-hand shop in Cardiff by a club member, Captain &quot;Jonah&quot; Jones, the Cup was bought back for the princely sum of £35. The Queen&#x27;s Cup has traditionally been awarded by the RSY. to the IRC Class 0 winner racing on the first Saturday of the event.

In 1950, Sir Peter Scott suggested to King George VI that larger yachts should compete for a new trophy as it was felt that the America&#x27;s Cup could not be restarted after the war. It was time for another competition of international significance to be introduced. King George was in favour and presented a trophy to the Royal Yachting Association, naming it &quot;The Britannia Cup&quot;. It certainly acted as a stimulus to big boat racing after the war. This competition also gave points towards the Admiral&#x27;s Cup. The Britannia Cup was first won in 1951 by Taisser IV and Group Captain R J S Barton. The Britannia Cup is awarded to the winner of the class nominated by the Royal Yacht Squadron on the Tuesday of the event, this is usually IRC Class 0 or IRC Class 1.

The &quot;New York Yacht Club Challenge Cup&quot; was presented by the New York Yacht Club in 1951 on 100th Anniversary of America&#x27;s victory which led to the commencement of the America&#x27;s Cup. It was presented to the Royal Yacht Squadron for races during Cowes Week Class 1. In 1957, with the advent of the Admiral&#x27;s Cup, points won in this race counted towards the Admiral&#x27;s Cup. In some ways the Admiral&#x27;s Cup was an extension of the N.Y.Y.C. Cup in that Miles Wyatt and four friends presented this overall trophy to encourage overseas yachts to race at Cowes. Latifa, owned by Michael Mason, first won the Cup in 1951. The New York Yacht Club Challenge Cup is awarded to the winner of the class nominated by the Royal Yacht Squadron on the Wednesday of the event, this is usually IRC Class 0 or IRC Class 1.

The &quot;Young Skipper&#x27;s Trophy&quot; is awarded to the Skipper, aged under 25 on the Sunday immediately after the event, who achieves the best results over the course of the entire Week. The competition is open to young skippers across all classes. The Trophy was first presented by Skandia at the 1995 event and recognises the success of the yachtsmen and women of the future.

The overall winner of Cowes Week is awarded with a special Scottish quaich &quot;Overall Winner Trophy&quot;

The Overall Winner Trophy is awarded to the winner of either Black Group or White Group, determined by the overall winner on points.

==In art==

French painter Raoul Dufy has depicted the races and Royal Yacht Squadron in several works of the late 1920s and early &#x27;30s, the most famous one of which is now in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C.

J.M.W. Turner also made a series of paintings, watercolours and pencil sketches of the regatta while visiting Cowes Castle in 1827.

<text>Quindío () is a department of Colombia. It&#x27;s located in the western central of the country, specifically in the Andean region. Its capital is Armenia. It&#x27;s famous for the quality of the coffee plantations, colorful architecture, benign weather, variety of hotel accommodations and tourist landmarks. This department is located in a strategic area, in the center of the triangle formed by the three main cities of the country: Bogotá, Medellín and Cali. Quindío is the second-smallest Colombian department (0.2% of the national territory) with 12 municipalities. Ethnographically and culturally, it belongs to the Paisa region.

== History ==

Before the Spanish invasion the entire area was inhabited by the peoples of the Quimbaya civilization until the 10th century B.C. At the time of Spanish conquest the area was inhabited by indigenous people of Carib descent known as the Pijao tribes. The native population was gradually reduced due to slavery, armed confrontations, and massacres during the Rubber boom, causing the territory to remain mostly uninhabited over the following centuries. At the present time, only a small population of nearly 2000 Amerindians remains in an indigenous reservation near La Tebaida.

The first settlement to be founded in the area was Salento in 1842. In the 19th century northern peasants from Antioquia set out to settle in the area and their goal was to stay there permanently in a process known as Colonización antioqueña (Antioquian Colonisation). Due to the inaccessibility of the territory and the lack of roads, trade and communications were made through mule caravans (arriería) or by porters such as the silleros. 

In 1905, the old Department of Antioquia was partitioned into two, giving rise to the new Department of Caldas, which at the time included the modern department of Risaralda. In 1908 Quindio territory, then in jurisdiction of the Cauca Department, was annexed to Caldas department.

== Geography ==

Most of its surface is occupied for the western face of the Cordillera Central. Highest mountain: (Nevado del Quindío) high. The lowest area is the valley of La Vieja River, high.

This department consists entirely of mountain landscapes covered in tropical rainforest and Guadua bamboo forests. The ground is enriched with ancient volcanic eruptions, raising its fertility. There are also many rivers and streams, including the Quindío River which rises in the Cocora Valley.

The weather varies widely, having two rainy seasons (April and November) separated by two dry seasons. The annual precipitation is around and comes from the humidity of winds from the Pacific Ocean being cooled as they rise over the Andes. The average temperature is between in the La Vieja river valley and in Salento.

== Quindío wax palm tree ==

With law 61 of 1985, the Colombian Congress adopted the Quindío wax palm tree, &quot;Ceroxylon quindiuense&quot;, a local endangered species adapted to high altitudes, as the National Tree. As ratified on September 16, 1985, by the then president of Colombia, Belisario Betancur, the law states: &quot;The species commonly known as the Quindío wax palm tree, scientific name Ceroxylon quindiuense, is declared the national tree and symbol of our fatherland. The national government is empowered to buy as much land as needed to create wildlife sanctuaries with the purpose of preserving this national symbol and its natural environment. It is forbidden to cut down the Quindío wax palm tree. The punishment for doing so shall be a fine and a term in jail&quot;.&quot;

The Quindío wax palm tree was nearly driven to extinction by the extraction of the resinous substance that it exudes. Furthermore, its leaves were widely used for the celebration of Holy Week processions, especially that of Palm Sunday.

== Economy ==
Quindío&#x27;s economy is based mainly in the harvest of coffee. It is one of the most important producers of Colombian coffee. The department belongs to the Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis which is the center of production and export of the highest quality coffee in Colombia. Plantain, cassava, Salentune potato and sugarcane are also cultivated, mostly for sale in local markets.

===The Quimbayan Christmas Panther===
The Quimbayan Christmas Panther is an indigenous &amp; sacred animal recognized by indigenous and mestizo communities in the Quindío Department of Colombia. Belief in the Christmas Panther (el puma de navidad) has developed throughout the history of the Quimbayan holiday known as the Alumbrado de Navidad (see Feast of the Immaculate Conception), celebrated on the 7th of December in recognition of the Roman Catholic belief in the Immaculate Conception of Christ. It is believed that the significance of the puma stems from the arrival of ethnically Spanish colonialists from Antioquia in the region during the 1850s. The colonialist&#x27;s Catholic traditions of using candlelight to celebrate the Immaculate Conception was combined with belief of the local Quimbaya tribe in the effect that fire (luces de fogota) had in protecting against panther attacks as pumas and other local fauna are believed to fear fire. Thus, in an instance of religious syncretism, the Alumbrado de Navidad and the symbolism of the puma to native peoples were linked. It is still a common practice to display the symbol of the panther (in the form of sculptures made of &quot;terra cotta&quot;, cloth, plastic, etc.) in conjunction with the lighting of candles on the night of December the 7th. Such religious syncretism is especially visible in the rural pueblos of Quindío where many residents claim full or partial descent from Quimbaya native peoples of the region.(the Quimbayan christmas panther is blue with yellow tail).

== Fauna and Flora ==

Quindío is the natural habitat of 520 species of birds and about 60 species of mammals. Many of them are endemisms. The area has the largest number of Heliconia species in the world and a large numbers of species of orchids, mainly of the genera Cattleya, Odontoglossum, Miltonia, Phragmipedium and Peristeria. The natural forests typical of the area, such as the páramo, and the cloud forest, are decreasing progressively due to agricultural activities. As a result, many of the endemic species are threatened, endangered or critically endangered. Some of them are: 
* Yellow-eared parrot
* Andean guan
* Colombian weasel
* Epicrionops columbianus caecilian
* Mano de Oso tree.
