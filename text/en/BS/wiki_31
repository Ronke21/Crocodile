<text>The neuroscience of religion, also known as neurotheology, and as spiritual neuroscience, attempts to explain religious experience and behaviour in neuroscientific terms. It is the study of correlations of neural phenomena with subjective experiences of spirituality and hypotheses to explain these phenomena. This contrasts with the psychology of religion which studies mental, rather than neural states.

Supporters of the neuroscience of religion say there is a neurological and evolutionary basis for subjective experiences traditionally categorized as spiritual or religious. The field has formed the basis of several popular science books.

==Introduction==
&quot;Neurotheology&quot; is a neologism that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs, experiences and practices. Other researchers prefer to use terms like &quot;spiritual neuroscience&quot; or &quot;neuroscience of religion&quot;. Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as:
* The perception that time, fear or self-consciousness have dissolved
* Spiritual awe
* Oneness with the universe
* Ecstatic trance
* Sudden enlightenment
* Altered states of consciousness

==Terminology==
Aldous Huxley used the term &quot;neurotheology&quot; for the first time in the utopian novel &quot;Island&quot;. The discipline studies the cognitive neuroscience of religious experience and spirituality. The term is also sometimes used in a less scientific context or a philosophical context. Some of these uses, according to the mainstream scientific community, qualify as pseudoscience. Huxley used it mainly in a philosophical context.

==Theoretical work==
In an attempt to focus and clarify what was a growing interest in this field, in 1994 educator and businessman Laurence O. McKinney published the first book on the subject, titled &quot;Neurotheology: Virtual Religion in the 21st Century&quot;, written for a popular audience but also promoted in the theological journal &quot;Zygon&quot;. According to McKinney, neurotheology sources the basis of religious inquiry in relatively recent developmental neurophysiology. According to McKinney&#x27;s theory, pre-frontal development, in humans, creates an illusion of chronological time as a fundamental part of normal adult cognition past the age of three. The inability of the adult brain to retrieve earlier images experienced by an infantile brain creates questions such as &quot;where did I come from&quot; and &quot;where does it all go&quot;, which McKinney suggests led to the creation of various religious explanations. The experience of death as a peaceful regression into timelessness as the brain dies won praise from readers as varied as writer Arthur C. Clarke, eminent theologian Harvey Cox, and the Dalai Lama and sparked a new interest in the field. 

What Andrew B. Newberg and others &quot;discovered is that intensely focused spiritual contemplation triggers an alteration in the activity of the brain that leads one to perceive transcendent religious experiences as solid, tangible reality. In other words, the sensation that Buddhists call &quot;oneness with the universe&quot;.&quot; The orientation area requires sensory input to do its calculus. &quot;If you block sensory inputs to this region, as you do during the intense concentration of meditation, you prevent the brain from forming the distinction between self and not-self,&quot; says Newberg. With no information from the senses arriving, the left orientation area cannot find any boundary between the self and the world. As a result, the brain seems to have no choice but &quot;to perceive the self as endless and intimately interwoven with everyone and everything.&quot; &quot;The right orientation area, equally bereft of sensory data, defaults to a feeling of infinite space. The meditators feel that they have touched infinity.&quot;

The radical Catholic theologian Eugen Drewermann developed a two-volume critique of traditional conceptions of God and the soul and a reinterpretation of religion (Modern Neurology and the Question of God) based on current neuroscientific research.

However, it has also been argued &quot;that neurotheology should be conceived and practiced within a theological framework.&quot;

==Experimental work==
In 1969, British biologist Alister Hardy founded a Religious Experience Research Centre (RERC) at Oxford after retiring from his post as Linacre Professor of Zoology. Citing William James&#x27;s &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; (1902), he set out to collect first-hand accounts of numinous experiences. He was awarded the Templeton Prize before his death in 1985. His successor David Hay suggested in &quot;God&#x27;s Biologist: A Life of Alister Hardy&quot; (2011) that the RERC later dispersed as investigators turned to newer techniques of scientific investigation.

===Magnetic stimulation studies===

During the 1980s Michael Persinger stimulated the temporal lobes of human subjects with a weak magnetic field using an apparatus that popularly became known as the &quot;God helmet&quot; and reported that many of his subjects claimed to experience a &quot;sensed presence&quot; during stimulation. This work has been criticised,
 though some researchers have published a replication of one God Helmet experiment.

Granqvist &quot;et al.&quot; claimed that Persinger&#x27;s work was not double-blind. Participants were often graduate students who knew what sort of results to expect, and there was the risk that the experimenters&#x27; expectations would be transmitted to subjects by unconscious cues. The participants were frequently given an idea of the purpose of the study by being asked to fill in questionnaires designed to test their suggestibility to paranormal experiences before the trials were conducted. Granqvist &quot;et al.&quot; failed to replicate Persinger&#x27;s experiments double-blinded, and concluded that the presence or absence of the magnetic field had no relationship with any religious or spiritual experience reported by the participants, but was predicted entirely by their suggestibility and personality traits. Following the publication of this study, Persinger &quot;et al.&quot; dispute this. One published attempt to create a &quot;haunted room&quot; using environmental &quot;complex&quot; electromagnetic fields based on Persinger&#x27;s theoretical and experimental work did not produce the sensation of a &quot;sensed presence&quot; and found that reports of unusual experiences were uncorrelated with the presence or absence of these fields. As in the study by Granqvist &quot;et al.,&quot; reports of unusual experiences were instead predicted by the personality characteristics and suggestibility of participants. One experiment with a commercial version of the God helmet found no difference in response to graphic images whether the device was on or off.

===Neuropsychology and neuroimaging===
The first researcher to note and catalog the abnormal experiences associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was neurologist Norman Geschwind, who noted a set of religious behavioral traits associated with TLE seizures. These include hypergraphia, hyperreligiosity, reduced sexual interest, fainting spells, and pedantism, often collectively ascribed to a condition known as Geschwind syndrome.

Vilayanur S. Ramachandran explored the neural basis of the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE using the galvanic skin response (GSR), which correlates with emotional arousal, to determine whether the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE was due to an overall heightened emotional state or was specific to religious stimuli. Ramachandran presented two subjects with neutral, sexually arousing and religious words while measuring GSR. Ramachandran was able to show that patients with TLE showed enhanced emotional responses to the religious words, diminished responses to the sexually charged words, and normal responses to the neutral words. This study was presented as an abstract at a neuroscience conference and referenced in Ramachandran&#x27;s book, &quot;Phantoms in the Brain&quot;, which was not published as a peer-reviewed scientific article.

Research by Mario Beauregard at the University of Montreal, using fMRI on Carmelite nuns, has purported to show that religious and spiritual experiences include several brain regions and not a single &#x27;God spot&#x27;. As Beauregard has said, &quot;There is no God spot in the brain. Spiritual experiences are complex, like intense experiences with other human beings.&quot; The neuroimaging was conducted when the nuns were asked to &quot;recall&quot; past mystical states, not while actually undergoing them; &quot;subjects were asked to remember and relive (eyes closed) the most intense mystical experience ever felt in their lives as a member of the Carmelite Order.&quot;
A 2011 study by researchers at the Duke University Medical Center found hippocampal atrophy is associated with older adults who report life-changing religious experiences, as well as those who are &quot;born-again Protestants, Catholics, and those with no religious affiliation&quot;.

A 2016 study using fMRI found &quot;a recognizable feeling central to ... (Mormon)... devotional practice was reproducibly associated with activation in nucleus accumbens, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and frontal attentional regions. Nucleus accumbens activation preceded peak spiritual feelings by 1–3 s and was replicated in four separate tasks. ... The association of abstract ideas and brain reward circuitry may interact with frontal attentional and emotive salience processing, suggesting a mechanism whereby doctrinal concepts may come to be intrinsically rewarding and motivate behavior in religious individuals.&quot;

===Psychopharmacology===
Some scientists working in the field hypothesize that the basis of spiritual experience arises in neurological physiology. Speculative suggestions have been made that an increase of N,N-dimethyltryptamine levels in the pineal gland contribute to spiritual experiences. It has also been suggested that stimulation of the temporal lobe by psychoactive ingredients of magic mushrooms mimics religious experiences. This hypothesis has found laboratory validation with respect to psilocybin.

<doc id="542380" wikidata="Q6941905" url="?curid=542380" title="Music history of the United States during the colonial era">
<text>The colonial history of the United States began in 1607 with the colonization of Jamestown, Virginia. Music of all genres and origins emerged as the United States began to form. From the Indigenous spiritual music to the African banjos, music in the United States is as diverse as its people. In New England, the music was very religious and was vitally important in the rising of American music. The migration of people southward led to the settling of the Appalachian Mountains. There many poor Europeans inhabited and brought country blues and fiddling. As music spread, the religious hymns were still just as popular. The first New England School, Shakers, and Quakers, which were all music and dance groups inspired by religion, rose to fame. In 1776, St. Cecilia Music Society opened in the Province of South Carolina and led to many more societies opening in the Northern United States.  African slaves were brought to the United States and introduced the music world to instruments like the xylophone, drums and banjo. The diverse music of the United States comes from the diverse type of people who first colonized this country.

==Indigenous music==
Native Americans in the United States had no indigenous traditions of classical music, nor a secular song tradition. Their music is spiritual in nature, performed usually in groups in a ritual setting important to Native American religion.

It was not until the 1890s that Native American music began to enter the American establishment. At the time, the first pan-tribal cultural elements, such as powwows, were being established, and composers like Edward MacDowell and Henry Franklin Belknap Gilbert used Native themes in their compositions. It was not until the much later work of Arthur Farwell, however, that an informed representation of Native music was brought into the American classical scene, part of the Indianist movement.

==Appalachian folk music==
The Appalachian Mountains have long been a center for cultural innovation, in spite of only sparse settlement by Native Americans and Europeans alike. Due to complex geologic reasons, the mountains and subranges were difficult to cross and included ridges of uninhabitable quartz mixed with valleys of soil unsuitable for agriculture. As a result, immigration of Europeans and their African slaves tended to be southern in direction, along the Piedmont area, and the Appalachian region was populated by poor Europeans. These Europeans were of English, Scots-Irish, German, and Huguenot origin. This settlement occurred primarily from 1775 to 1850.

English, Anglo-Irish, and Border Scottish tunes and ballads continued evolving from their distant roots along the Appalachians, eventually forming the major basis for jug bands, country blues, hillbilly music and a mix of other genres which eventually became country music. These folk tunes adopted characteristics from multiple sources, including British broadside ballads (which switched their themes from love to a distinctly American preoccupation with masculine work like mining or sensationalistic disasters and murder), African folk tunes (and their lyrical focus on semi-historical events) and minstrel shows and music halls. Popular ballads included &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; and &quot;Matty Groves&quot;. The banjo was also introduced, having gone through numerous geographic movements since its invention by the Arabians and subsequent travel across Africa, the Atlantic and throughout the Americas.

===Fiddling===
Appalachian fiddle styles are mostly derived from those brought to the colonies by English settlers. It is often claimed that the &quot;Scotch snap&quot; popularized by Niel Gow influenced Appalachian fiddling; however, according to historian Michael Newton, this is not true. Newton has claimed that English, Scottish, Irish, and American fiddle styles developed around the same time and are more like &quot;cultural cousins&quot; of one another. Appalachian technique was altered during the next century, with European waltzes and polkas being most influential. Square dances, based on the cotillion, and cakewalks, an African American imitation of white dances and the Virginia Reel arose during the 19th century.

===Lined-out hymnody===
Lined-out hymnody, a religious music style perpetuated by the Old Regular Baptists, Primitive Baptists, et al., is often studied and classified as folk music. See Old Regular Baptist, Lined-Out Hymnody.

==New England colonial music==
The religious singing traditions of New England played an important role in the early evolution of American music. Beginning with the Pilgrim colonists, who brought the &quot;Ainsworth Psalter&quot; with them to the New World, church hymns were popular across the region. Common New Englanders soon developed their own traditions, which were viewed by some as degenerate and wanton.

===New England choral traditions===

The original Puritan immigrants to New England sang a number of spiritual psalms, but generally disliked secular music, or at least those varieties which they viewed as encouraging immorality and disorder. They also objected to the use of musical instruments in churches and a complex vocal liturgy, both being associated with Roman Catholicism. The well-known minister Cotton Mather wrote, in &quot;Directions for a Candidate of the Ministry&quot;, on the subject:

The &quot;Ainsworth Psalter&quot; provided most of the tunes in use in New England church music until the late 17th century, when congregations abandoned the Psalter, claiming the tunes were too complex and difficult to sing.

The Bay Psalme Book (&quot;The Whole Booke of Psalmes Faithfully Translated into English Metre&quot;) was published in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1640; it was the first book of any kind printed in the English colonies of North America. It became the standard used by New England churches for many years, though it contained no music itself, merely providing psalms and pointing readers to other prominent publications. The Bay Psalm Book was faithful to its source, but did not produce beautiful singing. In 1651, then, a third edition was extensively revised by Henry Dunster and Richard Lyon, and became known as the New England Psalm Book; this became the standard for many years. In 1698, the ninth edition was printed and it was the first time that printed notation was used. By this point, the evolution from the &quot;Ainsworth Psalter&quot; to the New England Psalm Book had steadily dwindled the number of tunes in use.

The practice of lining out was often common, though its presence and utility depended on the degree of illiteracy found in congregation—generally, illiteracy was common, as was lining out. This was the process of a leader presenting one line of a song, then maintaining the first note for the congregation to match as they responded with the same line. This technique was also common in churches of Appalachia, such as the Regular Baptists of Kentucky.

====The organ and the birth of the church band====

Organs were the only instrument in use in church music during this era, and even this was not without controversy. During the colonial era, in churches in the Calvinist tradition - including in most Puritan meetinghouses - only unaccompanied singing was permitted during worship. Indeed, after the death of Thomas Brattle, treasurer of Harvard College in 1713, he bequeathed his organ to the Brattle Square Church in Boston, but the church (which he had founded) did not think it proper, and gave it to the King&#x27;s Chapel, which was the Anglican. Still, the organ was used in other New England churches. The first organ said to be designed for church use was installed in Newport, Rhode Island in 1733. Organs, however, were expensive and difficult to play. Only the largest churches could afford an organ and organist, and so many used more portable instruments, such as the bass fiddle, which was called &quot;God&#x27;s fiddle&quot; to distinguish it from the much-maligned &quot;Devil&#x27;s fiddle&quot; (violin). Later, other instruments like the ophicleide, trombone, cornet, German flute, bassoon, violin and clarinet were added, thus birthing the church band.

===Secular folk music===

Though it had long been supposed that the religious aversion to secular music inhibited instrumental folk music in New England, recent research by Barbara Lambert, focused on the Boston area, shows otherwise. Personally owned instruments recorded included the cittern, virginals, soprano clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, fife, flute, viol and violin and fiddle and the Mrs. Healy pipe.

Despite some hostility on the part of ministers like Increase Mather, dance music was popular in the New England colonial era, especially by the early 18th century, as the local population boomed with an influx of more settlers.

Broadside ballads were also known. As in British music, these were printed songs performed to a well-known tune, and included border ballads like &quot;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&quot;.

Though there is much in primary sources referring to folk music of the time, it is virtually all written by those who condemned the songs as uncouth. As such, little is objectively known. There was a distinction between the &quot;Regular Singing&quot; style of zealous reformers, mostly clergymen educated at Harvard, and the &quot;Common Way&quot; of the folk. Reformers included prominent clergymen like Thomas Walter and Nathaniel Chauncey, many of whom regarded their style of &quot;regular&quot; singing as more sophisticated as well as more devout. The evidence, however, indicates that the common people&#x27;s music was more complex, using techniques like ornamentation.

The formation of schools and societies promoting regular singing helped to spread the practice, and instruction books were published.

===John Wesley&#x27;s legacy and the spread south===
In the 18th century, Americans composed a number of their own hymns, often based on the Old Testament; the English nonconformist Isaac Watts, especially his &quot;Hymns and Spiritual Songs&quot;, was also very popular. John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, played a major role in revivalist hymnody after a trip to Georgia in 1735 at the invitation of James Oglethorpe. Wesley and his brother, Charles Wesley, went with Oglethorpe and twenty-six Moravian missionaries. The Moravian singing inspired John Wesley to study their music. He published a collection of translations of German hymns in 1737, &quot;A Collection of Psalms and Hymns&quot;, then returned to England in 1738, attending meetings of the Moravian Brethren in London. There, during a reading of Luther&#x27;s preface to the Epistle to the Romans, Wesley had a spiritual experience and found his faith in Christ rejuvenated.

====Great Awakening====
After returning to America, Wesley became an important preacher in a rise of fervent Christianity called the Great Awakening, along with George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards, among others. Wesley and his brother began writing a number of hymns, at first just words, and then with music beginning with a collection usually called the &quot;Foundery Collection&quot;.

Wesley and some other preachers fought against the embellishment of his hymns. In 1761, Wesley&#x27;s collection &quot;Select Hymns, with Tunes Annext: Designed Chiefly for Use of the People Called Methodists&quot; directed singers to follow the tunes &quot;exactly as printed&quot; and to &quot;sing in tune&quot;; both directions were impractical, since most of the worshippers likely couldn&#x27;t read music or carry a tune.

Nevertheless, the Great Awakening (and other hymnal styles from New England) spread south and changed from Wesley&#x27;s strict formulas. John Cennick (known for widespread hymns like &quot;Jesus My All to Heaven Is Gone&quot;) and John Newton are likely the two most important individuals in the creation of Great Awakening-era hymns, which were sung at camp meetings. These hymns, sung at large gatherings, especially in the south, provided a basis for gospel and blues in the late 19th and early 20th century. Some of the common features included Cennick&#x27;s innovation of hymns sung as a dialogue, as well as Newton, a former slave trader who converted after reading &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot; by Thomas à Kempis, who wrote more than two hundred hymns that drew on his own experiences wrestling with sin, and proved extremely popular.

====First New England School====

Compared with the older songs, Wesley and other new composers wrote with a simple structure. Rural farmers and workers expanded on these structures, creating complex songs which some musical conservatives railed against to no avail. It was in this context that a wave of itinerant singing masters, including William Billings, arose, creating hymns that remain standard across the country. This field was called the First New England School. Following Billings&#x27; pioneering footsteps were Supply Belcher, Andrew Law, Daniel Read, Jacob Kimball, Jeremiah Ingalls, John Wyeth, James Lyon, Oliver Holden, Justin Morgan and Timothy Swan.

The First New England School is usually considered the first uniquely American invention in music. The most characteristic feature was that the voices, male and female respectively, doubled their parts in any octave in order to fill out the harmony; this generated a texture of close-position chords that was unknown in European traditions.

William Billings was of special importance and popularity. A native of Boston, Billings was a tanner by trade, and was mainly self-taught in music. He did not always follow the standard rules of composition in his works, and has thus been called the &quot;first American composer to emphasize strongly a creative independence and to flaunt his personal idiosyncrasies in both his music and (especially) his published writings&quot;. He taught a famous singing school in Stoughton, Massachusetts in 1774. A few of the singers later formed the Stoughton Musical Society, a choral organization consisting of 25 men.

Supply Belcher, born in Stoughton, Massachusetts, though later based out of Farmington, Maine, is also especially well known. His only published tunebook was 1794&#x27;s &quot;The Harmony of Maine&quot;, which included anthems, fuging pieces, psalms and hymns, a number of which were secular. His songs were distinctively folky and down-to-earth. His contemporary Daniel Read, a Massachusetts-born musician who later moved to New Haven, Connecticut, was a popular musician who supported himself almost entirely off the sale of tunebooks. His first publication was entitled &quot;The American Singing Book; or, a New and Easy Guide to the Art of Psalmody Devised for the Use of Singing Schools in America&quot;. The title&#x27;s use of &quot;psalmody&quot; is here referring to singing societies which were spreading across the country, and is used without religious connotations.

Billings, Belcher and Read were the beginning of a chain of tunebook compilers that grew increasingly secular, as the art of psalmody lost its religious importance. Other Massachusetts-born compilers followed in their footsteps, beginning with Jeremiah Ingalls of Newbury, Vermont. Their songs were generally fugues, and were disapproved of by religious authorities. Andrew Law was an important compiler as well; he felt that American music should be more like European, and is best known for organizing singing schools and tunebooks. In addition, he composed several songs of note, and invented a kind of musical notation called shape note.

===Shakers===

The Shakers, or United Society of Believers in Christ&#x27;s Second Appearing, were a religion founded near Manchester, England, in the mid-1700s, and rose to prominence under the leadership of Ann Lee (Mother Ann). Lee had been born poor, and worked as a child in a cotton factory before her parents married her to a blacksmith. After giving birth to four children, all of whom died in infancy, Mother Ann came to view sexual intercourse as evil. Celibacy became an integral part of her religion. She was jailed for disturbing the Sabbath in 1772. Two years later, Shakers started moving to North America, settling in New England and as far south as New York. The rituals that Mother Ann designed, which she claimed to have seen in visions, included passionate dances that represented part of a battle between the holy Shakers and the devil and the flesh. Though their strange customs and British mannerisms drew some hostility from the colonists, as the American Revolutionary War was brewing, the Shakers grew in number and eventually spread as far south as Kentucky. Though Mother Ann died in 1784, the Shaker traditions lived on. Their best known dance song is Simple Gifts, used by Aaron Copland in his ballet score Appalachian Spring.

==European professionals==

In 1766, Charlestown (Charleston), South Carolina became the home of the St. Cecilia Society, the first musical society in North America. At the time, Charleston was a cultural center, attracting a number of musicians from Europe. In the decades after the Revolution, more northern cities like Philadelphia, New York and Boston largely took Charleston&#x27;s place. Philadelphia, home of the esteemed Alexander Reinagle, John Christopher Moller, Rayner Taylor and Susannah Haswell Rowson, was especially renowned for musical development. Reinagle became the most influential figure in Philadelphia&#x27;s musical life, organizing a number of concerts, organizations and musical events.

The English singer Benjamin Carr was especially notable. He arrived in New York in 1793, along with his brother and father. They soon became prominent music publishers and vendors, owning stores in New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Carr himself was a composer, organist, pianist and a publisher and editor. They published, in Philadelphia, &quot;The President&#x27;s March&quot; in 1793; written by Philip Phile, &quot;The President&#x27;s March&quot; is one of the most enduring of American patriotic songs. The march was soon politicized, adopted by the Federalists as a rallying song.

The British James Hewitt was one of the most distinguished musicians of early American history. He was already renowned in London before moving across the Atlantic, accompanied by Belgian composer and violinist Jean Gehot. Hewitt became established in New York, organizing concerts and other musical events. His opera &quot;Tammany; or, The Indian Chief&quot; became controversial after its first performance. It was the first American opera to deal with Native Americans, and was sponsored by the New York Tammany Society, an anti-Federalist organization. Hewitt was the target of much invective from Federalists as a result.

The English organist, choirmaster and composer William Selby was a major figure in Boston&#x27;s musical life, along with the Dutch organist, violinist and composer Peter Albrecht van Hagen and German oboist Johann Christian Gottlieb Graupner.

==Gentleman amateur composers==

The great urban centers of the mid-Atlantic included cities like Philadelphia and Baltimore, and it was there that European classical traditions were best represented. Philip Phile, Johann Friedrich Peter and Alexander Reinagle were prominent composers of the era, though Francis Hopkinson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence from Philadelphia, remains the best-known. One of his compositions, &quot;My Days Have Been So Wondrous Free&quot;, is well-remembered as the first art song from the United States (though this is disputed); it is, however, lacking in originality and innovation to set it apart from European compositions.

At the time, professional musicians were looked-down upon and considered coarse. Gentlemen performers played often, mostly for other aristocratic audiences, and without pay. As the United States developed, the south became the land of deep socioeconomic divisions. Land ownership and the possession of chattel slavery became an integral component of a gentleman&#x27;s livelihood, while in the north, the idea of a landed aristocracy never carried as much weight.

===Lowell Mason===
Perhaps the most influential early composer was Lowell Mason. A native of Boston, Mason campaigned against the use of shape-note notation, and for the education in standard notation. He worked with local institutions to release collections of hymns and maintain his stature. Opposed to the shape-note tradition, Mason pushed American music towards a European model.

==Rural Pennsylvanian music==
Rural Pennsylvania in the colonial era was home to religious minorities like the Quakers, as well as important Moravian and Lutheran communities. While the Quakers had few musical traditions, Protestant churches frequently made extensive use of music in worship J. F. Peter emerged from the Moravian tradition, while Conrad Beissel (founder of the Ephrata Cloister) innovated his own system of harmonic theory. The Lutheran traditions of Johann Sebastian Bach, Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel and Walther were propagated in Pennsylvania, and the city of Bethlehem remains a center of Lutheran musical traditions today.

===Mennonites===
The Mennonites, followers of Menno Simons, settled in Germantown after emigrating from the German Palatinate and Switzerland between 1683 and 1748. They were led by Willem Rittinghuysen (grandfather of astronomer and mathematician David Rittenhouse). The Mennonites used a hymnbook from Schaffhausen, reprinted in Germantown in 1742 as &quot;Der Ausbund Das ist etliche schöne christliche Lieder&quot;.

===Ephrata Cloister===
The Ephrata Cloister (&quot;Community of the Solitary&quot;) was founded in what is now Lancaster County on the Cocalico River in 1720. This was a group of Seventh Day Baptists led by Peter Miller and Conrad Beissel, who believed in using music as an integral part of worship. Beissel codified the Ephrata Cloister&#x27;s unique tradition in his &quot;Beissel&#x27;s Dissertation on Harmony&quot;; here, he divided notes into two types. These were &quot;masters&quot;, or notes belonging to the common chord, and &quot;servants&quot;, or all other notes. Accented syllables in Beissel&#x27;s works always fell on master notes, leaving servant notes for unaccented syllables. The Ephrata Cloister&#x27;s hymnbook was large, consisting of more than 1,000 hymns, many of which were accompanied by instruments including the violin. Many of these hymns were published in the 1740s and 50s.

===Moravian Church===
Founded in 1457, the Moravian Church originally spread across Moravia, Poland and Bohemia before persecution forced the remaining faithful to Saxony, where they lived under the protection of Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. Zinzendorf wrote hymns, and led the Moravians to America, where they began missionary work in Georgia but with little success. They moved on to Pennsylvania, and founded the town of Bethlehem on the banks of the Lehigh River. A group then left for Salem, North Carolina (now a part of Winston-Salem).

Both in Salem and Bethlehem, Moravians continued to use music in their ceremonies. Instruments included organs and trombones, and voices were usually in choirs. Players generally played on rooftops for most any occasion, ensuring that they could be heard for great distances. A legend has arisen claiming that a group of Native American warriors approached a Moravian settlement during the French and Indian War, but left after hearing a trombone choir because they believed it to be the voice of their Great Spirit. Moravians were devoted to missionary work, especially among African slaves and Native Americans; in 1763, they published a collection of hymns in the Delaware language.

Moravians also had a tradition of secular art music that included the famed composer Johann Friedrich Peter, who was a German born in the Netherlands who emigrated to Bethlehem in 1770. He brought with him copies of compositions by Joseph Haydn, Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach, Johann Stamitz and C. F. Abel. After living in Bethlehem for a time, Peter moved to Salem, where he founded the Collegium Musicum (in 1786) and collected hundreds of symphonies, anthems and oratorios. It was during this period that Peter also composed a number of well-respected instrumental pieces for twio violins, two violas and a cello; he also composed sacred anthems like &quot;It Is a Precious Thing&quot; and arias like &quot;The Lord Is in His Holy Temple&quot;.

The Moravian Church continued to produce a number of renowned composers into the 19th century, including John Antes as well as Francis F. Hagen, Johann Christian Bechler, Edward W. Leinbach, Simon Peter, David Moritz Michael, Georg Gottfried Müller, Peter Wolle, Jeremiah Dencke and Johannes Herbst. Herbst was also a noted collector, whose archives, left to the Salem church after his death, were made public in 1977; these included more than 11,000 pages of content. Salem has gradually become the center for Moravian musical innovation, partially due to the presence of the Moravian Music Foundation.

===Pietists===
In 1694, Johannes Kelpius brought a group of German Pietists to the banks of the Wissahickon Creek in southeastern Pennsylvania. These became known as the Hermits or Mystics of the Wissahickon; this 1871 map of Wissahickon Creek notes a Kelpius spring and Hermits Glen. Kelpius was a musician, and he and his followers brought with them instruments that became an integral part of church life. Kelpius was also a composer, and is sometimes called the first Pennsylvanian composer, based on his unproven authorship of several hymns in &quot;The Lamenting Voice of the Hidden Love&quot;. It is likely that he wrote the text, though the tunes are mostly based on German songs; the English translations in the collection are attributed to Christopher Witt, an Englishman who immigrated and joined the mystics, also building them a pipe organ, said to be the first privately owned organ in North America.

In 1703, Justus Falckner was ordained as pastor of the Gloria Dei Church; Falckner evidently believed that music was a very important element of missionary work, writing to Germany to ask for an organ, which he said would attract more Native American converts. Falckner was a Lutheran who wrote hymns such as &quot;Rise, Ye Children of Salvation&quot;.

===Harmony Society===
In 1803 and 1804, a group of Christian pietists led by George Rapp arrived from Württemberg, Germany, settled in Harmony, Pennsylvania, and formed the Harmony Society in 1805. The group lived communally, were pacifistic, advocated celibacy, and music was a big part of their lives. The Harmonites (or Harmonists) wrote their own music and even had an orchestra. The Society lasted until 1906, but their final settlement, Old Economy Village (now Ambridge, Pennsylvania) contains archives with sheet music that is still performed at special community events.

==African Americans==
Brought to the United States as early as 1619, enslaved Africans were from a variety of tribes from West Africa, including the Ashanti, Yoruba, Bini, Congo and Dahomean tribes. They spoke hundreds of languages; some came from rival tribes, or isolated communities with little connection to anyone else until the arrival of the slave traders. Some of the larger groups had extensive contact with the Muslims of North Africa and the distant cultures of East and Southern Africa.

Enslaved individuals brought with them work songs, religious music and dance, and a wide variety of instruments, including kalimba, xylophone, flutes and rattles. Perhaps the most important characteristic, however, was the call-and-response vocal style, in which a singer and the audience trade lines back-and-forth. This practice lent itself well to the burgeoning New England hymn tradition, and the two fields began commingling early in the nation&#x27;s history. Another unusual characteristic of much African music is that, rather than begin and end a tune or phrase on a pure note as in Western music, African singers would slide onto or below the note.

The most distinctive component of African music, however, is the focus on the rhythm. In this respect, African folk styles are far more complex than anything developed anywhere else in the world. African music is usually polyrhythmic, made by a wide variety of percussion instruments, both pitched and unpitched, using numerous kinds of natural materials. Polythythms were imported along with slaves to the New World, where it has found its way to genres ranging from African American gospel to pop-swing and rock and roll.

Many slavers encouraged enslaved individuals to sing as they work, believing that it improved morale and made them work harder. They generally required that all tunes remain cheerful and pleasant in tone to ensure that this occurred. This music, when accompanied, used only a single drum or other object used for percussion. Since they were often without instruments, clapping and foot-stomping became an integral part of the music of enslaved people. The banjo and various kinds of drums were the most important instruments, but enslaved Africans also used varieties of panpipes, notched gourds played with a scraper (similar to a güiro) and rattles. The thumb piano was also known, similar to the African mbira or sanza. In addition, Black individuals soon mastered European instruments like the clarinet, oboe, French horn and, most importantly, the violin. Often, prominent gentlemen had enslaved Black people act as musicians and entertainers. Some became quite prominent, like Virginia&#x27;s Sy Gilliat, who performed at state balls in Williamsburg. His assistant after the capitol moved to Richmond was known as London Brigs and was a renowned player.

===Drums===
Enslaved Africans in places like Haiti, Brazil and the Dominican Republic retained the use of drums, and their percussion has formed an integral part of Afro-Caribbean and Latin music. In the British North American colonies, however, drums were prohibited; colonial slavers had feared drums would be used as communication between enslaved people, and that the drums&#x27; use may aid uprisings and rebellions. Drums did, however, remain a prominent part of the music of the French colony of Louisiana.

===Banjo===
The banjo was a feature of enslaved Black life in America, mentioned by Thomas Jefferson, for example, in his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;, in which he referred to it as a &quot;banjar&quot; and noted that the instrument came from Africa. Other names included &quot;bangoe&quot;, &quot;banshaw&quot;, &quot;bangelo&quot;, &quot;banza&quot;, &quot;bangil&quot; and &quot;banjer&quot;. The instrument was described in West Africa as early as 1620 by Richard Jobson, but was present for some time before.

In North America, the banjo was typically made by hollowing out a gourd or calabash and attaching a long neck. Enslaved people then stretched a piece of animal hide, usually raccoon, over the bowl and attached four strings. Jefferson claimed that the &quot;banjar&quot; with which he was familiar was tuned to E-A-d-g.

<doc id="542386" wikidata="Q2557643" url="?curid=542386" title="Btrieve">
<text>Btrieve is a transactional database (navigational database) software product. It is based on Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM), which is a way of storing data for fast retrieval. There have been several versions of the product for DOS, Linux, older versions of Microsoft Windows, 32-bit IBM OS/2 and for Novell NetWare.

It was originally a record manager published by SoftCraft. Btrieve was written by Doug Woodward and Nancy Woodward and initial funding was provided in part by Doug&#x27;s brother Loyd Woodward. Around the same time as the release of the first IBM PCs, Doug received 50% of the company as a wedding gift and later purchased the remainder from his brother. After gaining market share and popularity, it was acquired from Doug and Nancy Woodward by Novell in 1987, for integration into their NetWare operating system in addition to continuing with the DOS version. The product gained significant market share as a database embedded in mid-market applications in addition to being embedded in every copy of NetWare 2.x, 3.x and 4.x since it was available on every NetWare network. After some reorganization within Novell, it was decided in 1994 to spin off the product and technology to Doug and Nancy Woodward along with Ron Harris, to be developed by a new company known as Btrieve Technologies, Inc. (BTI).

Btrieve was modularized starting with version 6.15 and became one of two database front-ends that plugged into a standard software interface called the MicroKernel Database Engine. The Btrieve front-end supported the Btrieve API and the other front-end was called Scalable SQL, a relational database product based upon the MKDE that used its own variety of Structured Query Language, otherwise known as SQL. After these versions were released (Btrieve 6.15 and ScalableSQL v4) the company was renamed to Pervasive Software prior to their IPO. Shortly thereafter the Btrieve and ScalableSQL products were combined into the products sold as Pervasive.SQL or PSQL, and later Actian Zen. Btrieve continued for a few years while ScalableSQL was quickly dropped. Customers were encouraged to upgrade to Pervasive.SQL, which supported both SQL and Btrieve applications.

==Architecture==


Btrieve is not a relational database management system (RDBMS). Early descriptions of Btrieve referred to it as a &quot;record manager&quot; (though Pervasive initially used the term navigational database but later changed this to transactional database) because it only deals with the underlying record creation, data retrieval, record updating and data deletion primitives. It uses ISAM as its underlying indexing and storage mechanism. A key part of Pervasive&#x27;s architecture is the use of a MicroKernel Database Engine, which allows different database backends to be modularised and integrated easily into their DBMS package, Pervasive.SQL. This has enabled them to support both their Btrieve navigational database engine and an SQL-based engine, Scalable SQL.

Current versions of Btrieve support system transactions and user transactions, where system transactions are a bundle of non-transactional operations and/or user transactions, whereas user transactions are transactions that work on actual data in the database. System transactions were developed to allow multiple transactions to be done in a batch and to make data recovery easier.

The Btrieve file format consists entirely of pages, which are the data that move between memory and storage when the engine performs an input/output operation. Versions prior to 6.0 merely used data pages, index pages and a file control record. The file had an index for searching that linked to physical pages. Beginning with version 6.0 logical pages were used. Logical are mapped to physical pages (pages at a fixed location in the file) on the disk by page allocation tables. The file control record contains important information about Btrieve files, such as the number of pages in current use. To avoid database corruption, Btrieve uses two methods of updating records: &quot;pre-image paging&quot; in Btrieve versions before 6.0, and &quot;shadow paging&quot; in subsequent versions. It was primarily the change-over from pre-image paging to shadow-paging, which necessitated radical file format changes, that caused compatibility issues between version 6 and previous versions.

==History==
Btrieve has been owned and developed by four different companies: SoftCraft, Novell, Btrieve Technologies, Inc. (later renamed Pervasive Software), and Actian Corporation. They have a committed and loyal developer-base and according to company literature, they remain fully committed to the product. Pervasive Software set up a &quot;Btrieve Society&quot; to recognise existing developers.

Under DOS, Btrieve up to version 5, was a terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR) which functioned as an application programming interface (API) database engine, supplying applications programs with function calls to implement a multi-user database with record locking. The network version worked in a similar way.

In the early years, DOS versions up to version 5 sold for a price of around US$1,000, but the executable TSR database engine file could be distributed with applications without charge.

===SoftCraft years===
The product was launched in February 1982 by SoftCraft, a firm located in Austin, Texas, by Doug and Nancy Woodward. Doug became the vice-president and handled software development, Nancy became the president of the company. They released a number of versions over the next few years: in February 1983 they released the Btrieve 2.x series, and when MS-DOS 2.0 developed support for file and directory handles, they released Btrieve 3.0. When MS-DOS 3.1 standardised its internal interfaces in March 1985, they released Btrieve 3.1 C/S one month later, which had network and client/server support. In February 1986, Btrieve 4.0 was released, and when the 4.1 upgrade was released it gained support for extended key types and supplemental indexes.

Although Btrieve was fairly popular, it was an API database engine. The killer-app database manager on the PC, dBase II and its successors, were database management systems (DBMS) which could be used either as a free-standing, general-purpose application, or a database programming language. Btrieve was also more expensive to buy than dBase, although run-time licensing was free of charge. Btrieve grew to a developer base of over 5,000 users and was widely used in the financial area. The company took some time to create a user interface for the product, however in 1984 they released Xtrieve, a menu-driven program that used a new .DDF data dictionary to enforce relational database rules.

===Novell acquisition===

In 1987, Novell started diversifying and buying companies to add to their NetWare operating system. One of the companies they purchased was SoftCraft. Nancy Woodward became the Vice-President and General Manager of Novell&#x27;s Austin operations while Doug Woodward became the Vice-President of Advanced Database Technologies. Early the next year, Btrieve 5.0 was released to run as a native NetWare application, or Value Added Process. According to Jim Kyle, &quot;it had auto-increment key types, the BROUTER network process server, data-only and key-only files, and optional data compression&quot;. Version 5.1 was released in 1990 with increased file-handling transaction capability, logging and roll-forward operations, along with several API enhancements. Several versions were created for DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows. Version 6.0 was released in June 1992. However, it was not promoted extensively by Novell, and due to enhancements, (such as the change from pre-imaging to shadow-paging) it was incompatible with previous versions of Btrieve. The market did not increase much for Btrieve and it did not see wide adoption due to these issues.

When the company was acquired by Novell, SoftCraft had been working on a product called XQL, an SQL interpreter designed to better deal with industry standard SQL, which the Xtrieve package was not fully compliant with. This became the basis for NetWare SQL, which was initially released in 1989, and was a bare-bones SQL interpreter which implemented the base IBM version of SQL.

===Btrieve Technologies, Inc.===

By 1994, Novell had largely given up on attempting to make NetWare into a complete alternative operating system, and started selling off many of the companies it had acquired only a few years earlier. They had minimally promoted Btrieve, largely due to the delay (24 months) in releasing version 6. Negotiations between The Woodwards and Novell were entered into, and after two years Novell announced on 26 Jan, 1994 that it was going to transfer ownership of Btrieve to Btrieve Technologies, Incorporated (also known as BTI). On 29 April 1994, the transfer was completed and Nancy Woodward became the Chairman of BTI and Doug Woodward was made the Chief Technical Officer. The CEO position was given to Ron Harris, a former employee of Texas Instruments, and one of the founding employees of Citrix Systems, Inc. where he was employed first as Director of Strategic Planning, then as Vice-President of Marketing, and finally as the Product Group Vice President.

Btrieve was totally rewritten, and on 1 July 1994 Btrieve 6.15 for DOS, Windows and OS/2 was released. Novell SQL was renamed to Scalable SQL reflecting the change in ownership of the company. In 1995, version 6.15 was released for Novell NetWare, Windows NT Server and for Windows NT/95, and thus became a cross-platform database product. The concept of a Micro Kernel Database Engine (MKDE) was introduced in this version.

===Pervasive Software===
In 1996, the company renamed itself to Pervasive Software, and their product to Pervasive.SQL. In 1997, the company went public. They did this in order to allow greater penetration of the relational database market and to re-align as an SQL vendor, though they are still marketing and developing Btrieve. Pervasive completed its IPO in September. The company continued using the MKDE in version 6.30. In 1997, Pervasive released ScalableSQL 4.0, a relational database product, and Btrieve 7.0.

In 2000, Novell was criticized after it ceased bundling Pervasive.SQL with NetWare from version 5.1 onwards; instead, it shipped with a trial version that shut down after 90 days. The latest version, Pervasive PSQL Summit v11, was released in September 2010.

===Actian Corporation===
In 2013, Actian Corporation acquired Pervasive Software. In February 2016 Actian released Btrieve 12.

==Versions==

===Btrieve for DOS===
There was one DOS client-based configuration of Btrieve created by SoftCraft. SoftCraft&#x27;s definition of a client-based version was a &quot;Btrieve engine running on a particular workstation.&quot; This meant the record-management engine connected directly to the files via operating system functions and modified the records accordingly, whether the files were local or on a network. The client-based engine allowed five concurrent users to access the database at any one time. All record processing was done on the workstation the engine was installed on. In later versions, Btrieve for DOS could use either of two modes: what they called SEFS (Single-Engine File Sharing) or MEFS (Multi-Engine File Sharing).

===Btrieve for NetWare===
Btrieve for NetWare was essentially the same as Btrieve for DOS with some extra features available only on NetWare at the time. It ran a server process, called codice_1, on the file-sharing server and this managed data input/output in conjunction with the network file system. The server process was first implemented for NetWare 2.x as a NetWare &quot;Value-Added Process&quot; (VAP) called codice_2, then as a &quot;NetWare Loadable Module&quot; (NLM) for NetWare 3.x (and later versions). codice_1 was the database engine that dealt with access to records, however it also accepted requests for the transmission of requested data to another server via the codice_4 process.

Btrieve used &quot;requesters&quot; to make database input/output requests from the client workstation. The requesters were available for DOS, OS/2, Microsoft Windows, and UnixWare. The program codice_5 accepted input/output requests via the Btrieve API and relayed them to codice_1. It then handled the responses from codice_1 and relayed them back to the appropriate application.

The codice_4 process allowed for incoming requests to be &quot;routed&quot; to a copy of the database on another server. It was loaded on the NetWare server and dealt with communication between multiple server processes running on the file-server through the use of two &quot;File Server Tables&quot;. According to Pervasive, these provide a list of &quot;server names and addresses, and the &quot;Server Routing Table&quot;&quot;. BROUTER also enabled communication requests to be routed to the correct server via SPX by looking up the codice_9 NetWare Loadable Module and coordinated locks and other mechanisms that controlled access to the data in the Btrieve database.

Btrieve for DOS used the SEFS and MEFS modes for file sharing, and because it was able to run on a network it was able to use exclusive and concurrent transactions.

===Btrieve for Windows===
Btrieve for Windows was created before the company rewrote the codebase to use the MKDE. It featured SEFS and MEFS file sharing mechanisms; used shadow-paging and allowed for exclusive and concurrent locks. It handled version 6.x and 6.1 files differently. Version 6.x files could handle operations on part of a record rather than locking the entire record. It handled records larger than 64KB, implemented VATs, ACSs, new data types, allowed for percentage operations (where the record could be located and manipulated by the physical location in the file) and handled duplicate keys. Version 6.x was capable of dropping or adding any index on the fly (version 6.0 and below could drop only supplemental indexes). Version 6.1 files allowed for concurrent and system transactions, the optional renumbering of keys, case insensitive ACS tables, and enhanced locking operations.

Btrieve for Windows could run as a client to the database that utilized SEFS or MEFS modes, or it could directly access the Btrieve server.

====Client-based Btrieve====

The client-based version of Btrieve has all the database files either directly on the local computer or via a mapped network drive (set up via the DOS codice_10 command).

Applications make a function call to codice_11, a loader and requester interface. The loader and requester module verify the codice_12 configuration file is correctly set up to load the client-based Btrieve engine. In turn, this loads the local interface to the btrieve engine (codice_13). If necessary, this local interface loads the Btrieve engine (codice_14) into memory and sends the necessary database requests to it. The database engine then calls various Win32 system libraries to perform file operations on the database files.

====Client-based Btrieve accessing server-based Btrieve====
The client-based version of Btrieve for Windows could access server-based versions of Btrieve via a DOS-based &quot;requester&quot;. The requestor required the use of DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) which allowed program access to DOS extended memory accessible only via the CPU&#x27;s Protected Mode.

As with the client-based interface, the Btrieve-based application makes a call to the codice_11 loader and requester interface library. This library checks the codice_12 file to see if it needs to access data on the local system or whether it needs to access data on a remote server. If it needs to access the server, then it uses the Windows version of DPMI to access a DOS-based requester named codice_5. The requester then establishes a network connection to the server, which processes the request and passes back a message to the requester when the database request is completed.

===Btrieve for Windows NT/Windows 95===
Btrieve for Windows NT and Windows 95 was released in 1995, along with Btrieve for Netware and Btrieve for Windows NT Server. It had reached version 6.15 and started using the MKDE. The file sharing mechanisms remained the same, as it still used SEFS and MEFS file sharing modes, shadow-paging and allowed for exclusive and concurrent locks. This version of Btrieve allowed for null values in keys, which meant that a record could be entered into the database when information on the key was not available. It meant the key would not be included into the index, and this helped decrease unnecessary searching of the database via the index. It also introduced the concept of a &quot;system transaction&quot; and a &quot;user transaction&quot;. (see &quot;System and user transactions&quot;). The MKDE also allowed gaps between auto-incremented keys. Variable-tail allocation tables were introduced in version 6.15, so they were included in the Windows NT/95 build of Btrieve.

There are two configurations of Btrieve for Windows NT/95, standalone workstation and client/server.

====Standalone workstation====

When using the &quot;standalone workstation&quot; configuration of Btrieve, all processing of records is done on the local workstation. The workstation relies on the underlying mechanisms of Windows to allow the MKDE (program codice_18) to gain direct access to the database files, and uses lock files to deal with concurrency issues.

In this configuration, the application makes calls to the Btrieve API, or Microkernel Interface (codice_19). The call is then processed by the interface and passed to the MKDE (codice_18) which uses the underlying operating system file system (whether it be network or local) to directly access the database files.

This leads to some peculiar issues. If Btrieve uses Windows file sharing and has the database engine open files directly on a file share, for instance, and there is network instability (e.g. a network cable is disconnected) during an update the fields used to link one Btrieve file to another can become unsynchronized (to all intents and purposes the data loses its relationships or links to other data) and the database file itself can get corrupted (though the chance of this is reduced due to pre-image paging).

====Client/Server====

When using the &quot;client/server&quot; (or &quot;Server edition&quot;) configuration of Btrieve, processing of records is generally done on a Windows file server via a mapped drive (a way of mapping a file share to a &quot;virtual&quot; disk drive in Windows via the codice_10 command). It utilises the permissions that you are assigned when authenticating, either log-on permissions, or permissions given when codice_10 is utilized.

On Windows 95, the MKDE interface (a Windows dynamic link library (DLL) called codice_19) determines what database access method is in use via the configuration file. If it detects both the client/server and workstation engines are installed on the same machine, it checks whether the target is set to workstation or server. If running on Windows NT and the server process codice_24 is running along with the standalone workstation process codice_18 it looks in the registry to determine if the target is a server or workstation. In both cases, if the MKDE interface is set to workstation, (the &quot;Standalone workstation&quot; configuration) it uses the MKDE (codice_18) to access the file directly. If it is set to server, the MKDE interface on the client uses a communications module (on Windows 95 this is codice_27, on Windows NT this is codice_28) that &quot;talks&quot; to the server. The server itself has its own matching communications module (again either codice_27 or codice_28) that resides on the mapped drive. The server DLL communicates with the server MKDE (codice_24) which updates records, then sends a confirmation that the operation succeeded, back through the communications module to the client.

The advantage of this system is, if a network connection failure occurs, the MKDE on the server will be able to detect it and recover in a more graceful manner than the workstation configuration is able to.

====Configuration====

A configuration utility was included with Btrieve to alter MKDE settings. The settings that could be changed were:

* File settings: this category contains settings related to files, file handles, record locks, indexes, and log files. The number of open files and logical file handles was set in here, as well as the number of record locks per client; index balancing and an option to create files in pre 6.x format are in this category. It also controlled whether the Microkernel kept a log of operations executed on selected files. In this section the method of file sharing could be set to either MEFS or SEFS. The system transaction hold limit sets the number of system transactions performed during write operations for shared files.
* Memory organisation: this category contained settings related to the size of buffers the Microkernel needed to allocate for various purposes.
* Client/System transactions: this category contains settings related to transactions, including the number supported and how and when they will be logged.
* System resources/directories: this category contains settings related to the number of clients and threads supported as well as the location of various system files.
* Trace operations: this category contains settings related to tracing various Btrieve operations. Tracing is an advanced feature used mainly for debugging purposes.

===Pervasive.SQL 7===
Pervasive.SQL 7 was released in March, 1998, and included Scalable SQL 4 and Btrieve 7.0. Btrieve 7.0 ran on the same platforms as Btrieve 6.x: Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51 &amp; 4, Netware and DOS. However, the company changed to a component-based architecture called SmartComponents to resolve compatibility issues with upgrades. This used a component identification scheme both embedded into the file and encoded into the file name, along with dynamic binding of &quot;glue files&quot; (DLLs loaded into memory only when needed). The dynamic binding of components was done using a new &quot;Abstract OS Services DLL&quot; that looked for the latest version of the appropriate needed component via the file name encoding. This &quot;glue module&quot; is then loaded into memory and used. The old log file format of Btrieve 6.x was also replaced with a new centralised log called codice_32 and that had a unified and enhanced log file format. They also improved their error messages and error message reporting mechanisms.

The MKDE was retained in Pervasive.SQL 7. However, due to the new component architecture&#x27;s dynamic binding, the internal architecture was modified. The application using Btrieve calls a services manager which then searches through various configured directories for specific encoded filename. The file name loaded for Btrieve files in Backus–Naur form is:

 &lt;filename&gt; ::= &lt;platform-code&gt; &quot;BIF&quot; &lt;major-functional-level&gt; &lt;minor-functional-level&gt;
 &lt;platform-code&gt; ::= &quot;W1&quot; | &quot;W2&quot; | &quot;W3&quot; | &quot;W9&quot; | &quot;WT&quot; | &quot;NW&quot; | &quot;O3&quot;
 &lt;major-functional-level&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt;
 &lt;minor-functional-level&gt; ::= &lt;number&gt; &lt;number&gt;
 &lt;number&gt; ::= &quot;0&quot; | &quot;1&quot; | &quot;2&quot; | &quot;3&quot; | &quot;4&quot; | &quot;5&quot; | &quot;6&quot; | &quot;7&quot; | &quot;8&quot; | &quot;9&quot;

The &quot;glue&quot; module, which is a DLL, is loaded into memory and becomes the interface to the MKDE. The MKDE then determines whether it is configured to be a workstation-based configuration or a server-based configuration. It then passes requests via its communications &quot;requester&quot; module onto the database server, or directly modifies the database files if configured in workstation mode.

===Pervasive.SQL 2000/2000i===
Pervasive.SQL 2000 and Pervasive.SQL 2000i use essentially the same architecture as Pervasive.SQL 7, though 2000i includes i*Net server. It uses the same component model, has the ability to use the Btrieve or Scalable SQL engines and continues using an MKDE. This version included support for Red Hat Linux, Caldera OpenLinux, SUSE and Solaris. It also had better integration with Terminal Services, though only one instance of the database engine may run on any terminal server platform. You cannot run separate copies of the database engine within two or more terminal sessions.

===Pervasive.SQL V8===
Introduced in December 2002, Pervasive.SQL V8 improves the performance of both Btrieve and SQL applications using a number of new technologies.
*Client side caching greatly improves read performance by maintaining a portion of the database&#x27;s contents on the local PC.
*Turbo Write Acceleration (TWA) groups disk writes into groups, minimizing interactions with disk.
*Transaction Logging provides a slightly less failure protection than transaction durability, but improves overall performance.

The V8 Security Feature Pack (a mid-release product update designated 8.5) added important new security features designed to lock down Pervasive.SQL data files. Prior to 8.5, access to Btrieve data was controlled by the operating system&#x27;s security mechanism. This meant that any user who needed read/write access to the database, also needed read/write access to the underlying data files. 8.5 introduced new security models, which allow administrators to control access to the Btrieve data using database security. Once activated, database security no longer requires that the user has access to the underlying files. In addition, client/server configurations no longer require the use of network shares or mapped drives. Applications can reference secure Btrieve data using a URI connection string.

===Pervasive PSQL v9===
Pervasive PSQL v9 includes new Java GUIs, built on the Eclipse framework. These GUIs are available for both Microsoft Windows and Linux. In addition, v9 included many SQL performance and syntax updates, improving both the speed and flexibility of all of the SQL interfaces - ADO.Net, JDBC, ODBC, and OLE DB. Finally, PSQL v9 expanded the Btrieve maximum file size from 64GB in 8.x and earlier file formats to 128 GB in 9.0 format files, and again to 256GB for files in the 9.5 file format.

In conjunction with PSQL v9 Pervasive reintroduced the DDF Builder utility and added support for text searching with the Full Text Search (FTS) add-on, which was later removed from the product line. DDF Builder provides a mechanism for Btrieve users to define the meta data for existing Btrieve files, thus allowing Btrieve data to be accessible via SQL tools and utilities.

All versions of the MKDE retain full backward read-level compatibility with earlier versions of Btrieve, including those that pre-date introduction of the MKDE itself, and do not change the file&#x27;s version unless specifically requested to do so. Btrieve files that are in the 5.x or older file formats MUST be rebuilt (using the GUI or command line Rebuild utilities) to 6.x or newer format to support database writes from the 9.0 or newer database engine.

===Pervasive PSQL v10===
Pervasive PSQL v10 was released in September 2007 and was the first version of Pervasive PSQL Server and Client to provide support for 64-bit operating systems. The Btrieve API and distributing tuning interface (DTI) were both enhanced to support 64-bit. Pervasive PSQL Workgroup and other components of the SDK were not enhanced for 64-bit support.

The release of Pervasive PSQL v10 was timed to offer support for the then newly available Windows Vista and soon to arrive Windows Server 2008 operating systems. Pervasive PSQL v10 Server, Workgroup and Client all support Windows Vista. Pervasive PSQL v10 Server is Certified for Windows Server 2008.

Also included in Pervasive PSQL v10 was Xtreme input/output (XIO), a 32-bit Windows database accelerator that enabled access of extended memory to expand the database cached past the normal 2GB limit on 32-bit Windows systems. Xtreme input/output also included update compression algorithms and streamlined writing techniques to improve database input/output performance.

Digital license enforcement, called Product Authorization, was introduced for the Pervasive PSQL product line with Pervasive PSQL v10. Product Authorization was initially implemented with trial downloads and e-commerce orders. Products sold through the Pervasive Distributor and ISV partners were upgrade to include product authorization with the release of Pervasive PSQL v10 SP3 in November 2009. Pervasive PSQL v10 SP3 was also released as a Windows 7 compatible application.

Pervasive PSQL v10 retained backward compatibility by using the 9.5 file format with an increase in the maximum data file size to 256GB and increase in the maximum page size to 16,384 bytes.

Support for NetWare, Windows NT, Windows 98, Windows ME, DOS 6.22 and 16-bit applications were dropped with Pervasive PSQL v10. Although the Windows and Linux versions of Pervasive PSQL v9 products are no longer sold, Pervasive still sells and supports Pervasive PSQL v9 for NetWare.

In 2010, Pervasive Software released Pervasive PSQL v11, which allows users to take full advantage of multithreading for faster database processing.

===Pervasive PSQL v11===
Pervasive PSQL v11 was released in September 2010. One of the key drivers of the engineering effort behind Pervasive PSQL v11 was the redesign of the database engine to increase performance and scalability on multi-core CPU&#x27;s. Pervasive PSQL v11 optimizes parallel threads performing similar activities, allowing the database to engage multiple cores during task execution. PSQL v11 also provides enhancements to the low-level synchronization mechanisms in the navigational interface. Multiple users can read the same cached file pages simultaneously and their operations can proceed on independent cores. Non-user activity such as checkpoints and log management can run on separate cores and multiple users accessing independent files can proceed on different cores.

Multi-core support is available with all versions of PSQL v11: 32- and 64-bit Windows and Linux Servers, and 32-bit Workgroup. Internal testing at Pervasive documented performance increases of 300% when comparing PSQL v10 to PSQL v11 on an 8-core server running Microsoft 2008 Enterprise Server SP2(64-bit).

(IPv6) support on Windows is included in Pervasive PSQL v11 with continued support for IPv4 environments. Pervasive PSQL v11 supports IPv6 with both the Btrieve and DTI (Distributed Tuning Interface) access methods.

64-bit server versions of PSQL v11 include a 64-bit relational/SQL engine as well as the 64-bit navigational/Btrieve engine, along with a 64-bit ODBC driver. The driver is installed with the 64-bit versions of PSQL Server and PSQL Client.

Pervasive updated the PSQL software development kit with the addition of the Pervasive PSQL ADO.NET Data Provider 3.5. The Data Provider 3.5 is compliant with .NET Framework versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.5 SP1 and 4.0, and runs under .NET Framework 4.0 with support for Entity Framework 1.0 features. Pervasive PSQL v11 also updated the PDAC (Pervasive Direct Access Components) access method with support for Embardacero&#x27;s RAD Studio 2009 and RAD Studio 2010.

Product Authorization was extended in Pervasive PSQL v11 to include OEM customers, along with the introduction of a web-based portal for OEM&#x27;s to generate keys and manage licenses for PSQL v11. Telephone authorization (a method of authorizing Pervasive PSQL without requiring an Internet connection) was first introduced with PSQL v11 and made available to all Pervasive customers.

Pervasive PSQL v11 continues with the 9.5 file format, maintaining backward compatibility with previous releases.

Support for Windows 2000 was dropped with Pervasive PSQL v11.

===Pervasive PSQL Ecosystem===
Pervasive now offers a number of add-on products which extend the basic features of the PSQL DBMS. The latest versions of each of the products, AuditMaster v7, Backup Agent v3, and DataExchange v4, were released in December 2010.

*Pervasive AuditMaster provides real-time auditing of all database interactions, whether Btrieve or SQL. Logs of data events can be queried to track changes to sensitive data. Alerts can also be created to notify the appropriate personnel or launch the associated process.
*Pervasive Backup Agent manages PSQL&#x27;s continuous operations mode and allows backup software to reliably copy online databases.
*Pervasive DataExchange provides data synchronization and replication between two or more PSQL engines, ensuring that critical data is always available.

===Btrieve 12===
In February 2016 Actian announced Btrieve 12. Actian say Btrieve 12 has new features, is compatible with Microsoft Windows Vista to 10, and Windows Server 2008 and 2012, and is file format and API compatible with Btrieve 6.15, allowing it to read and write Btrieve 6.15 files from earlier 16-bit and DOS applications.

<text>The director-general of the World Trade Organization is the officer of the World Trade Organization (WTO) responsible for supervising and directing the organization&#x27;s administrative operations. Since the World Trade Organization&#x27;s decisions are made by member states, either through a Ministerial Conference or through the General Council, the director-general has little power over matters of policy – the role is primarily advisory and managerial in nature. The director-general supervises the WTO secretariat of about 700 staff and is appointed by WTO members for a term of four years.

The post of Director-General had been vacant since 31 August 2020, after the resignation of Roberto Azevêdo of Brazil who had held the post since 1 September 2013. On February 5, 2021, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria secured the support of the United States for Director-General of the WTO. Okonjo-Iweala assumed office on 1 March 2021, and became both the first woman and the first African to hold this position.

Before the formation of the WTO, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) had a series of directors-general. Peter Sutherland was the last director-general of GATT and the first of the WTO.

==List of directors-general==
This is a list of former holders of the office of Director-General. The post was created in 1995, although the earlier office of Executive Secretary is often seen as a direct equivalent.
===2020 director-general selection===

In May 2020, Director-General Azevedo announced that he would step down on 31 August 2020, a year before his mandate was due to expire. On 17 August 2020, human rights organizations urged the member nations to reject the nomination of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Mohammad Al-Tuwaijri, citing the country&#x27;s poor human rights records.

General Council Chair David Walker initiated a process of consultation with members from 7 September 2020 onwards, through which the field of candidates was gradually reduced until an appointment was to be made. Eight candidates were put forward by WTO member governments to succeed Azevedo.

The final selection required a consensus of the 164 member countries and was expected to take place in November, 2020. However, due to &quot;the health situation and current events&quot; the meeting was postponed.

<doc id="542392" wikidata="Q7248701" url="?curid=542392" title="2004 Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leadership election">
<text>On January 23, 2004, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leader Ernie Eves announced his intention to step down as leader before the fall of 2004. Eves was elected party leader in the party&#x27;s 2002 leadership election, and became Premier of Ontario. He led the party to defeat in the 2003 provincial election.

Under the Ontario PC Party Constitution, a leadership election could not be called until Eves submitted a formal request to the Party Executive. He did not do so until June, and a few days later, on June 13, the Party Executive called a leadership election for September 18, 2004. The leadership vote was won by John Tory with approximately 54% of the vote on the second ballot.

==Candidates==

*Jim Flaherty was the provincial Minister of Finance under Mike Harris, and Eves&#x27; Minister of Enterprise, Opportunity and Innovation. He was the runner-up to Eves in the 2002 leadership election. Flaherty was a social conservative, whose 2002 campaign focused on law and order and neo-conservative wedge issues.
*Frank Klees was the Chief Government Whip in the Harris government, and Minister of Tourism and of Transportation in the Eves government. His campaign criticized the Harris-Eves government for its reliance on unelected advisors, and promised to return the party to the grassroots. He also argued for health care reform, particularly the introduction of private health care for those who can afford it.
*John Tory, a centrist, Red Tory ideologically, was principal secretary to Bill Davis, who was Premier of Ontario from 1971 to 1985. Tory had been the CEO of Rogers Cablesystems. He ran a strong campaign for Mayor of Toronto in the 2003 civic election. His campaign leaned more to the political centre and appealed to Red Tories.

==Possible candidates who did not run==

*Elizabeth Witmer has been a Waterloo, Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) since 1990. She served as Minister of Health and then Minister of the Environment under Mike Harris, and Minister of Education and Deputy Premier under Ernie Eves. Witmer was a candidate in the 2002 race that selected Eves. She had considered running in the 2004 race, but decided to endorse John Tory instead.
*John Baird, MPP for Nepean since 1995, was mentioned as a possible candidate, but decided to support Jim Flaherty.
*Cam Jackson, a Tory MPP since 1985 from Burlington, Ontario and variously Minister of Tourism, Citizenship and Seniors in the Harris and Eves governments, was rumoured to be considering a run, but decided to endorse John Tory.

==Debates==

The first of three candidates&#x27; debates occurred in Ottawa on July 26. The second debate occurred in Sudbury on August 17. The final debate was held in London, Ontario on August 30. While the third debate was a restrained affair the first two were marked by clashes between Flaherty and Tory as Flaherty accused his rival of not being a real conservative and being out of touch and elitist.

Final candidate speeches were made at the convention in Toronto on September 17. Flaherty made the unusual decision to deliver his speech in his home town of Whitby and have it broadcast live to the convention. This was criticized as being &quot;gimmicky&quot; and reminiscent of the disastrous Magna budget and as demonstrating a hostility to Toronto. The criticisms of Flaherty&#x27;s decision overshadowed the contents of his speech.

==Issues==

Flaherty&#x27;s campaign was strongly critical of outgoing leader Ernie Eves accusing him of abandoning the &quot;Common Sense Revolution&quot; and arguing for a return to the policies of Mike Harris. A social conservative, Flaherty was perceived to be in favour of taking the party into a more right wing direction on social issues but said little of this during the actual campaign. John Tory&#x27;s campaign hearkened back to the party&#x27;s success under Bill Davis and argued that Ontarians were tired of divisiveness and polarization and that a more moderate direction was needed if the party was to succeed.

Tory, a former candidate for Mayor of Toronto, also emphasised the importance of urban issues and appealing to residents of Ontario&#x27;s largest city which had shut the Tories out in the 2003 provincial election. He also argued against the privatization of crown corporations such as the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, which had been advocated by his rivals. Klees ran as a grassroots candidate, arguing that the party had been the captive of unelected backroom consultants during the Harris and Eves years and had cut off not only party members but backbench MPPs.

Klees ran as a defender of the Common Sense Revolution but, unlike Flaherty, was not seen as a social conservative. He was the only candidate to argue in favour of &quot;two tier&quot; health care and privatization within medicare.

==Process==

The Ontario Progressive Conservatives use a system similar to that used by the federal Conservative Party of Canada in its leadership election. Each provincial riding association has up to 100 Electoral Votes that will be allocated among the candidates by proportional representation according to the votes cast by party members within the riding. This is not a pure &quot;one member one vote&quot; system since each riding generally has equal weight. (Ridings with fewer than 100 voting party members are allocated one Electoral Vote per voting member; ridings with 100 or more voting party members are allocated 100 Electoral Votes.)

This system is designed to favour candidates who can win support across the province and win in a majority of ridings. This replicates what is necessary for a party to win a general election - though without the &quot;first past the post&quot; feature of elections under the Westminster system. The party will use a preferential ballot on which voters rank their choices. If no candidate wins a majority of Electoral Votes, then the third-place candidate is eliminated, and his votes are redistributed according to second-choice rankings.

Members could only vote in person on September 18, or at the September 13 advance poll, or by proxy. Mail-in, phone-in and Internet voting are not permitted. Only party members in good standing as of 6:00 p.m., EDT, August 7, 2004, were eligible to vote. According to the party, there were 61,104 eligible voters, only 25,323 of whom cast ballots for a turnout of 41.4%.

Party president Blair McCreadie announced that candidates would be under a spending cap of $1 million, which is less than the $1.5 million permitted in the last leadership contest.

The leadership election was administered by an impartial Leadership Election Committee chaired by McCreadie and co-chaired by MPP Julia Munro. The Chief Election Officer was Tom Barlow.

<text>The Copeland Islands is a group of three islands in the north Irish Sea, north of Donaghadee, County Down, Northern Ireland, consisting of Lighthouse Island (also known as Old Island), Copeland Island (also known as Big Island) and Mew Island. They lie within the civil parish of Bangor.

Along with Lambay Island and Ireland&#x27;s Eye off County Dublin, the islands are the only other one of the 258 sometime inhabited islands of Ireland which lie on the east coast.

==Etymology==
The Copeland Islands most likely derive their name from the de Coupland family, who settled in the Newtownards area, at the northern end of the Ards Peninsula, along with other Normans in the 12th century. This family also lent their name to other landmarks in the vicinity such as Copeland Water near Carrickfergus and the townland of Ballycopeland in the civil parish of Donaghadee.

The earliest possible recorded name for the islands, however, may be the Old Norse &#x27; (&#x27; meaning &#x27;merchant&#x27; and &#x27; meaning &#x27;island&#x27;), recorded in the Norse &#x27;, and dated to 1230. It has been suggested that &#x27;Kaupmann&#x27; developed into &#x27;Copman&#x27; and then into &#x27;Copeland&#x27;, with the form &#x27;Copman&#x27; recorded several times in the late 16th century in reference to the islands.

The original Irish name for the islands is unknown. However, it has been suggested that the 1570s usage of &#x27;Helaine Harr[o]n[e]&#x27; may be an attempt at Anglicising the Irish name &#x27; (island of the (kidney-shaped) ridge). The modern Irish name, however, is a Gaelicisation of Copeland Islands into &#x27;.

==History==

There are three islands included in the Copeland Islands: the Great Copeland Island (also known as Big Island or Copeland Island), the Lighthouse Island (also known as Old Island, which does not have a lighthouse now), and Mew Island, which does have a lighthouse. Over a century ago, Lighthouse Island had a population of about 100, including a school master with 28 pupils.

In 1671, James Ross obtained a fee farm grant of the islands, and in 1770 David Kerr bought them from The 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil (by the second creation). As the islands were a danger to ships, a light beacon was made on Lighthouse Island (also known as Old Island or Cross Island) in about 1715; it burned over 400 tons of coal every year. In 1796, the new British and Irish Lighthouse Board announced the erection of oil lamps and, in 1813, the new lighthouse was built. In 1884, a new lighthouse was built on Mew Island. In 1954, the Bird Observatory was established by Arnold Benington.

Hans Sloane visited the islands and noted how &quot;how the sea wrens laid their eggs on the ground so thick that they had difficulty in passing along without treading on them while the birds screamed overhead.&quot;

Until the 20th century, the islands were used by smugglers who brought tobacco and spirits through the islands and into County Down.

==Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI)==
Copeland Islands ASSI is located off the County Down coast of Northern Ireland and comprises The Great Copeland, Lighthouse Island and Mew Island. The islands are important sites for breeding seabirds and waders, in addition to their coastal plant communities and geological features.

Big Copeland supports the most diverse range of habitats of the three islands. Communities influenced by the sea are found around the shore with maritime cliff vegetation and pockets of salt marsh also present. The centre of the island is occupied by semi-improved wet grassland with frequent areas of marsh.

==Flora==
The vegetation on Light House Island consists of short rabbit grazed turf with large areas of rank bracken (&quot;Pteridium aquilinum&quot;) and Himalayan balsam (&quot;Impatiens glandulifera&quot;). Notable species include English stonecrop (&quot;Sedum anglicum&quot;), rock sea-spurrey (&quot;Spergularia rupicola&quot;), Scots lovage (&quot;Ligusticum scoticum&quot;) and sea purslane (&quot;Halimione portulacoides&quot;). Lighthouse Island represents the southern limit for Scots lovage in Europe and the northern limit for sea purslane in Ireland. Other plants on the islands include &quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot;, &quot;Hyacinthoides hispanica&quot;, &quot;Dactylorhiza purpurella&quot; and &quot;Centaurium erythraea&quot;.

Mew Island is dominated by rank stands of grass and bracken but, as on all the islands, notable areas of inter-tidal and exposed rock habitat are present.

===Algae===
The marine algae of the Lighthouse Island and the Mew Islands was studied in 1975 and the 56 species, or genera, identified were listed and published.

===Lichens===
Nineteen species of lichens were collected in 1984, the identifications were confirmed or corrected by Dr A Fletcher. As far as is known these are the only records of lichens from the Lighthouse Island.

*&quot;Lecanora atra&quot; (Huds.) Ach.
*&quot;Lecanora gangaleoides&quot; (Nyl.)
*&quot;Ochrolechia parella&quot; (L.) Massel
*&quot;Parmelia caperata&quot; (L.) Ach.
*&quot;Ramalina siliquosa&quot; (Huds.) A.L.Sm.

*&quot;Anaptychia fusca&quot; (Huds.) Vainio
*&quot;Diplotomma chlorophaeum&quot; (Hepp ex Mull.Argh.) Szat.
*&quot;Lecanora ploytropa&quot; (Hoffm.) Rabenh.
*&quot;Lecanora rupicola&quot; (L.) Zahlbr.
*&quot;Lecidella subincongrua&quot; (Nyl.) Hertel and Luckert
*&quot;Ochrolechia parella&quot; (L.) Massel
*&quot;Parmelia sulcata&quot; Taylor
*&quot;Polysporina simplex&quot; (Davies) Vezda
*&quot;Rhizocarpon constrictum&quot; Malme
*&quot;Rhizocarpon geographicum&quot; (L.) DC
*&quot;Verrucaria ditmarsica&quot; Erichen
*&quot;Verrucaria maura&quot; Wahlenb.

==Fauna==
The islands are internationally important sites for breeding populations of Manx shearwater and Arctic tern and nationally important sites for breeding Mediterranean gull, common gull and common eider. The Manx shearwater colony on Copeland Islands holds more than 1.7% of the world population. The colony is in excess of four thousand pairs. The rabbit populations on the islands play an important role in the breeding success of the Manx shearwater as the latter mainly nest in the rabbit burrows that honeycomb the islands. Grazing by rabbits maintains a short sward, which is desirable for the fledglings.

Great Copeland has an internationally important Arctic tern colony, with some 550 pairs. The site now represents the largest colony for this species in Ireland. Mew Island has been an important tern colony in the past and it is hoped that positive management will encourage terns to become re-established. The islands are the most important breeding sites in Northern Ireland for common gull with over 250 pairs present. Big Copeland has recently held Northern Ireland&#x27;s first successful breeding pair of Mediterranean gull. The islands are home to a nationally important population of breeding eider duck. In total the three islands account for 14% of the Irish population. Non-breeding eider form part of the nationally important population that occurs along the Outer Ards coast and Belfast Lough areas.

Other breeding colonies of note include black guillemot, water rail and stock dove. The latter species has suffered a dramatic decline in Northern Ireland, but numbers have increased on Copeland with some 100 pairs now breeding. Breeding waders such as lapwing and snipe may be found further inland. Here the taller vegetation, interspersed with open areas, provides an ideal breeding habitat. Birds of prey favour the islands when the breeding season is over. Hen harrier, sparrowhawk, buzzard, kestrel, merlin and peregrine falcon are all seen regularly.

Mammals, such as the grey seal, common seal, harbour porpoise, bottlenose dolphin, common minke whale, common dolphin and otter have been reported from the Copeland Islands.

Lepidoptera have also been recorded. 19 species of butterflies, 31 species of macro-Lepidoptera and three species of micro-Lepidoptera.

A beetle new to Northern Ireland was recorded in 2013: &quot;Diplapion confluens&quot; (Kirby).

==Lighthouses==

A light station was established on Lighthouse Island in the early 18th century and a lighthouse built in 1815. It has been inactive since 1884, when the lighthouse was abandoned in favour of the Mew Island Lighthouse, but the ruined stump of the 16 m (52 ft) stone tower remains. The ruins of the keeper&#x27;s house have been rebuilt to house a bird observatory. The island is now owned by the National Trust and operated by the volunteer members of the Copeland Bird Observatory.

The Mew Island Lighthouse is currently active, and was converted to automatic operation with the lighthouse keepers permanently withdrawn in 1996.

==&quot;Princess Victoria&quot; ferry disaster==
On 31 January 1953, , a British Transport Commission ferry sailing from Stranraer to Larne, sank off the Copeland Islands in a heavy storm with the loss of 135 lives.

<text>Stress–strain analysis (or stress analysis) is an engineering discipline that uses many methods to determine the stresses and strains in materials and structures subjected to forces. In continuum mechanics, stress is a physical quantity that expresses the internal forces that neighboring particles of a continuous material exert on each other, while strain is the measure of the deformation of the material.

In simple terms we can define stress as the force of resistance per unit area, offered by a body against deformation. Stress is the ratio of force over area (S = R/A, where S is the stress, R is the internal resisting force and A is the cross-sectional area). Strain is the ratio of change in length to the original length, when a given body is subjected to some external force (Strain= change in length÷the original length). 

Stress analysis is a primary task for civil, mechanical and aerospace engineers involved in the design of structures of all sizes, such as tunnels, bridges and dams, aircraft and rocket bodies, mechanical parts, and even plastic cutlery and staples. Stress analysis is also used in the maintenance of such structures, and to investigate the causes of structural failures.

Typically, the starting point for stress analysis are a geometrical description of the structure, the properties of the materials used for its parts, how the parts are joined, and the maximum or typical forces that are expected to be applied to the structure. The output data is typically a quantitative description of how the applied forces spread throughout the structure, resulting in stresses, strains and the deflections of the entire structure and each component of that structure. The analysis may consider forces that vary with time, such as engine vibrations or the load of moving vehicles. In that case, the stresses and deformations will also be functions of time and space.

In engineering, stress analysis is often a tool rather than a goal in itself; the ultimate goal being the design of structures and artifacts that can withstand a specified load, using the minimum amount of material or that satisfies some other optimality criterion.

Stress analysis may be performed through classical mathematical techniques, analytic mathematical modelling or computational simulation, experimental testing, or a combination of methods.

The term stress analysis is used throughout this article for the sake of brevity, but it should be understood that the strains, and deflections of structures are of equal importance and in fact, an analysis of a structure may begin with the calculation of deflections or strains and end with calculation of the stresses.

==Scope==

===General principles===
Stress analysis is specifically concerned with solid objects. The study of stresses in liquids and gases is the subject of fluid mechanics.

Stress analysis adopts the macroscopic view of materials characteristic of continuum mechanics, namely that all properties of materials are homogeneous at small enough scales. Thus, even the smallest particle considered in stress analysis still contains an enormous number of atoms, and its properties are averages of the properties of those atoms.

In stress analysis one normally disregards the physical causes of forces or the precise nature of the materials. Instead, one assumes that the stresses are related to strain of the material by known constitutive equations.

By Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, any external forces that act on a system must be balanced by internal reaction forces, or cause the particles in the affected part to accelerate. In a solid object, all particles must move substantially in concert in order to maintain the object&#x27;s overall shape. It follows that any force applied to one part of a solid object must give rise to internal reaction forces that propagate from particle to particle throughout an extended part of the system. With very rare exceptions (such as ferromagnetic materials or planet-scale bodies), internal forces are due to very short range intermolecular interactions, and are therefore manifested as surface contact forces between adjacent particles — that is, as stress.

===Fundamental problem===
The fundamental problem in stress analysis is to determine the distribution of internal stresses throughout the system, given the external forces that are acting on it. In principle, that means determining, implicitly or explicitly, the Cauchy stress tensor at every point.

The external forces may be body forces (such as gravity or magnetic attraction), that act throughout the volume of a material; or concentrated loads (such as friction between an axle and a bearing, or the weight of a train wheel on a rail), that are imagined to act over a two-dimensional area, or along a line, or at single point. The same net external force will have a different effect on the local stress depending on whether it is concentrated or spread out.

===Types of structures===
In civil engineering applications, one typically considers structures to be in static equilibrium: that is, are either unchanging with time, or are changing slowly enough for viscous stresses to be unimportant (quasi-static). In mechanical and aerospace engineering, however, stress analysis must often be performed on parts that are far from equilibrium, such as vibrating plates or rapidly spinning wheels and axles. In those cases, the equations of motion must include terms that account for the acceleration of the particles. In structural design applications, one usually tries to ensure the stresses are everywhere well below the yield strength of the material. In the case of dynamic loads, the material fatigue must also be taken into account. However, these concerns lie outside the scope of stress analysis proper, being covered in materials science under the names strength of materials, fatigue analysis, stress corrosion, creep modeling, and other.

==Experimental methods==
Stress analysis can be performed experimentally by applying forces to a test element or structure and then determining the resulting stress using sensors. In this case the process would more properly be known as &quot;testing&quot; (destructive or non-destructive). Experimental methods may be used in cases where mathematical approaches are cumbersome or inaccurate. Special equipment appropriate to the experimental method is used to apply the static or dynamic loading.

There are a number of experimental methods which may be used:

*Tensile testing is a fundamental materials science test in which a sample is subjected to uniaxial tension until failure. The results from the test are commonly used to select a material for an application, for quality control, or to predict how a material will react under other types of forces. Properties that are directly measured via a tensile test are the ultimate tensile strength, maximum elongation and reduction in cross-section area. From these measurements, properties such as Young&#x27;s modulus, Poisson&#x27;s ratio, yield strength, and the strain-hardening characteristics of the sample can be determined.
*Strain gauges can be used to experimentally determine the deformation of a physical part. A commonly used type of strain gauge is a thin flat resistor that is affixed to the surface of a part, and which measures the strain in a given direction. From the measurement of strain on a surface in three directions the stress state that developed in the part can be calculated.
* Neutron diffraction is a technique that can be used to determine the subsurface strain in a part.
*The photoelastic method relies on the fact that some materials exhibit birefringence on the application of stress, and the magnitude of the refractive indices at each point in the material is directly related to the state of stress at that point. The stresses in a structure can be determined by making a model of the structure from such a photoelastic material.
*Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is a technique used to study and characterize viscoelastic materials, particularly polymers. The viscoelastic property of a polymer is studied by dynamic mechanical analysis where a sinusoidal force (stress) is applied to a material and the resulting displacement (strain) is measured. For a perfectly elastic solid, the resulting strains and the stresses will be perfectly in phase. For a purely viscous fluid, there will be a 90 degree phase lag of strain with respect to stress. Viscoelastic polymers have the characteristics in between where some phase lag will occur during DMA tests.

==Mathematical methods==
While experimental techniques are widely used, most stress analysis is done by mathematical methods, especially during design.

===Differential formulation===
The basic stress analysis problem can be formulated by Euler&#x27;s equations of motion for continuous bodies (which are consequences of Newton&#x27;s laws for conservation of linear momentum and angular momentum) and the Euler-Cauchy stress principle, together with the appropriate constitutive equations.

These laws yield a system of partial differential equations that relate the stress tensor field to the strain tensor field as unknown functions to be determined. Solving for either then allows one to solve for the other through another set of equations called constitutive equations. Both the stress and strain tensor fields will normally be continuous within each part of the system and that part can be regarded as a continuous medium with smoothly varying constitutive equations.

The external body forces will appear as the independent (&quot;right-hand side&quot;) term in the differential equations, while the concentrated forces appear as boundary conditions. An external (applied) surface force, such as ambient pressure or friction, can be incorporated as an imposed value of the stress tensor across that surface. External forces that are specified as line loads (such as traction) or point loads (such as the weight of a person standing on a roof) introduce singularities in the stress field, and may be introduced by assuming that they are spread over small volume or surface area. The basic stress analysis problem is therefore a boundary-value problem.

===Elastic and linear cases===
A system is said to be elastic if any deformations caused by applied forces will spontaneously and completely disappear once the applied forces are removed. The calculation of the stresses (stress analysis) that develop within such systems is based on the theory of elasticity and infinitesimal strain theory. When the applied loads cause permanent deformation, one must use more complicated constitutive equations, that can account for the physical processes involved (plastic flow, fracture, phase change, etc.)

Engineered structures are usually designed so that the maximum expected stresses are well within the realm of linear elastic (the generalization of Hooke’s law for continuous media) behavior for the material from which the structure will be built. That is, the deformations caused by internal stresses are linearly related to the applied loads. In this case the differential equations that define the stress tensor are also linear. Linear equations are much better understood than non-linear ones; for one thing, their solution (the calculation of stress at any desired point within the structure) will also be a linear function of the applied forces. For small enough applied loads, even non-linear systems can usually be assumed to be linear.

===Built-in stress (preloaded) ===

A preloaded structure is one that has internal forces, stresses, and strains imposed within it by various means prior to application of externally applied forces. For example, a structure may have cables that are tightened, causing forces to develop in the structure, before any other loads are applied. Tempered glass is a commonly found example of a preloaded structure that has tensile forces and stresses that act on the plane of the glass and in the central plane of glass that causes compression forces to act on the external surfaces of that glass.

The mathematical problem represented is typically ill-posed because it has an infinitude of solutions. In fact, in any three-dimensional solid body one may have infinitely many (and infinitely complicated) non-zero stress tensor fields that are in stable equilibrium even in the absence of external forces. These stress fields are often termed hyperstatic stress fields and they co-exist with the stress fields that balance the external forces. In linear elasticity, their presence is required to satisfy the strain/displacement compatibility requirements and in limit analysis their presence is required to maximise the load carrying capacity of the structure or component.

Such built-in stress may occur due to many physical causes, either during manufacture (in processes like extrusion, casting or cold working), or after the fact (for example because of uneven heating, or changes in moisture content or chemical composition). However, if the system can be assumed to behave in a linear fashion with respect to the loading and response of the system, then effect of preload can be accounted for by adding the results of a preloaded structure and the same non-preloaded structure.

If linearity cannot be assumed, however, any built-in stress may affect the distribution of internal forces induced by applied loads (for example, by changing the effective stiffness of the material) or even cause an unexpected material failure. For these reasons, a number of techniques have been developed to avoid or reduce built-in stress, such as annealing of cold-worked glass and metal parts, expansion joints in buildings, and roller joints for bridges.

===Simplifications===

Stress analysis is simplified when the physical dimensions and the distribution of loads allow the structure to be treated as one- or two-dimensional. In the analysis of a bridge, its three dimensional structure may be idealized as a single planar structure, if all forces are acting in the plane of the trusses of the bridge. Further, each member of the truss structure might then be treated a uni-dimensional members with the forces acting along the axis of each member. In which case, the differential equations reduce to a finite set of equations with finitely many unknowns.

If the stress distribution can be assumed to be uniform (or predictable, or unimportant) in one direction, then one may use the assumption of plane stress and plane strain behavior and the equations that describe the stress field are then a function of two coordinates only, instead of three.

Even under the assumption of linear elastic behavior of the material, the relation between the stress and strain tensors is generally expressed by a fourth-order stiffness tensor with 21 independent coefficients (a symmetric 6 × 6 stiffness matrix). This complexity may be required for general anisotropic materials, but for many common materials it can be simplified. For orthotropic materials such as wood, whose stiffness is symmetric with respect to each of three orthogonal planes, nine coefficients suffice to express the stress–strain relationship. For isotropic materials, these coefficients reduce to only two.

One may be able to determine &quot;a priori&quot; that, in some parts of the system, the stress will be of a certain type, such as uniaxial tension or compression, simple shear, isotropic compression or tension, torsion, bending, etc. In those parts, the stress field may then be represented by fewer than six numbers, and possibly just one.

===Solving the equations===
In any case, for two- or three-dimensional domains one must solve a system of partial differential equations with specified boundary conditions. Analytical (closed-form) solutions to the differential equations can be obtained when the geometry, constitutive relations, and boundary conditions are simple enough. For more complicated problems one must generally resort to numerical approximations such as the finite element method, the finite difference method, and the boundary element method.

==Factor of safety==

The ultimate purpose of any analysis is to allow the comparison of the developed stresses, strains, and deflections with those that are allowed by the design criteria. All structures, and components thereof, must obviously be designed to have a capacity greater than what is expected to develop during the structure&#x27;s use to obviate failure. The stress that is calculated to develop in a member is compared to the strength of the material from which the member is made by calculating the ratio of the strength of the material to the calculated stress. The ratio must obviously be greater than 1.0 if the member is to not fail. However, the ratio of the allowable stress to the developed stress must be greater than 1.0 as a factor of safety (design factor) will be specified in the design requirement for the structure. All structures are designed to exceed the load those structures are expected to experience during their use. The design factor (a number greater than 1.0) represents the degree of uncertainty in the value of the loads, material strength, and consequences of failure. The stress (or load, or deflection) the structure is expected to experience are known as the working, the design or limit stress. The limit stress, for example, is chosen to be some fraction of the yield strength of the material from which the structure is made. The ratio of the ultimate strength of the material to the allowable stress is defined as the factor of safety against ultimate failure.

Laboratory tests are usually performed on material samples in order to determine the yield and ultimate strengths of those materials. A statistical analysis of the strength of many samples of a material is performed to calculate the particular material strength of that material. The analysis allows for a rational method of defining the material strength and results in a value less than, for example, 99.99% of the values from samples tested. By that method, in a sense, a separate factor of safety has been applied over and above the design factor of safety applied to a particular design that uses said material.

The purpose of maintaining a factor of safety on yield strength is to prevent detrimental deformations that would impair the use of the structure. An aircraft with a permanently bent wing might not be able to move its control surfaces, and hence, is inoperable. While yielding of material of structure could render the structure unusable it would not necessarily lead to the collapse of the structure. The factor of safety on ultimate tensile strength is to prevent sudden fracture and collapse, which would result in greater economic loss and possible loss of life.

An aircraft wing might be designed with a factor of safety of 1.25 on the yield strength of the wing and a factor of safety of 1.5 on its ultimate strength. The test fixtures that apply those loads to the wing during the test might be designed with a factor of safety of 3.0 on ultimate strength, while the structure that shelters the test fixture might have an ultimate factor of safety of ten. These values reflect the degree of confidence the responsible authorities have in their understanding of the load environment, their certainty of the material strengths, the accuracy of the analytical techniques used in the analysis, the value of the structures, the value of the lives of those flying, those near the test fixtures, and those within the building.

The factor of safety is used to calculate a maximum allowable stress:
formula_1

==Load transfer==
The evaluation of loads and stresses within structures is directed to finding the load transfer path. Loads will be transferred by physical contact between the various component parts and within structures. The load transfer may be identified visually or by simple logic for simple structures. For more complex structures more complex methods, such as theoretical solid mechanics or numerical methods may be required. Numerical methods include direct stiffness method which is also referred to as the finite element method.

The object is to determine the critical stresses in each part, and compare them to the strength of the material (see strength of materials).

For parts that have broken in service, a forensic engineering or failure analysis is performed to identify weakness, where broken parts are analysed for the cause or causes of failure. The method seeks to identify the weakest component in the load path. If this is the part which actually failed, then it may corroborate independent evidence of the failure. If not, then another explanation has to be sought, such as a defective part with a lower tensile strength than it should for example.

==Uniaxial stress==
A linear element of a structure is one that is essentially one dimensional and is often subject to axial loading only. When a structural element is subjected to tension or compression its length will tend to elongate or shorten, and its cross-sectional area changes by an amount that depends on the Poisson&#x27;s ratio of the material. In engineering applications, structural members experience small deformations and the reduction in cross-sectional area is very small and can be neglected, i.e., the cross-sectional area is assumed constant during deformation. For this case, the stress is called &quot;engineering stress&quot; or &quot;nominal stress&quot; and is calculated using the original cross section.
formula_2
where P is the applied load, and Ao is the original cross-sectional area.

In some other cases, e.g., elastomers and plastic materials, the change in cross-sectional area is significant. For the case of materials where the volume is conserved (i.e. Poisson&#x27;s ratio = 0.5), if the &quot;true stress&quot; is desired, it must be calculated using the true cross-sectional area instead of the initial cross-sectional area, as:
formula_3
where

The relationship between true strain and engineering strain is given by
formula_4

In uniaxial tension, true stress is then greater than nominal stress. The converse holds in compression.

==Graphical representation of stress at a point==
&quot;Mohr&#x27;s circle&quot;, &quot;Lame&#x27;s stress ellipsoid&quot; (together with the &quot;stress director surface&quot;), and &quot;Cauchy&#x27;s stress quadric&quot; are two-dimensional graphical representations of the state of stress at a point. They allow for the graphical determination of the magnitude of the stress tensor at a given point for all planes passing through that point. Mohr&#x27;s circle is the most common graphical method.
&quot;Mohr&#x27;s circle&quot;, named after Christian Otto Mohr, is the locus of points that represent the state of stress on individual planes at all their orientations. The abscissa, formula_5, and ordinate, formula_6, of each point on the circle are the normal stress and shear stress components, respectively, acting on a particular cut plane with a unit vector formula_7 with components formula_8.

===Lamé&#x27;s stress ellipsoid===

The surface of the ellipsoid represents the locus of the endpoints of all stress vectors acting on all planes passing through a given point in the continuum body. In other words, the endpoints of all stress vectors at a given point in the continuum body lie on the stress ellipsoid surface, i.e., the radius-vector from the center of the ellipsoid, located at the material point in consideration, to a point on the surface of the ellipsoid is equal to the stress vector on some plane passing through the point. In two dimensions, the surface is represented by an ellipse (Figure coming).

===Cauchy&#x27;s stress quadric===
The Cauchy&#x27;s stress quadric, also called the &quot;stress surface&quot;, is a surface of the second order that traces the variation of the normal stress vector formula_9 as the orientation of the planes passing through a given point is changed.

The complete state of stress in a body at a particular deformed configuration, i.e., at a particular time during the motion of the body, implies knowing the six independent components of the stress tensor formula_10, or the three principal stresses formula_11, at each material point in the body at that time. However, numerical analysis and analytical methods allow only for the calculation of the stress tensor at a certain number of discrete material points. To graphically represent in two dimensions this partial picture of the stress field different sets of contour lines can be used:
* &quot;Isobars&quot; are curves along which the principal stress, e.g., formula_12 is constant.
* &quot;Isochromatics&quot; are curves along which the maximum shear stress is constant. These curves are directly determined using photoelasticity methods.
* &quot;Isopachs&quot; are curves along which the mean normal stress is constant.
* &quot;Isostatics&quot; or &quot;stress trajectories&quot; are a system of curves which are at each material point tangent to the principal axes of stress - see figure 
* &quot;Isoclinics&quot; are curves on which the principal axes make a constant angle with a given fixed reference direction. These curves can also be obtained directly by photoelasticity methods.
* &quot;Slip lines&quot; are curves on which the shear stress is a maximum.

<text>In algebra, a binomial is a polynomial that is the sum of two terms, each of which is a monomial. It is the simplest kind of a sparse polynomial after the monomials.

==Definition==
A binomial is a polynomial which is the sum of two monomials. A binomial in a single indeterminate (also known as a univariate binomial) can be written in the form
:formula_1
where and are numbers, and and are distinct non-negative integers and is a symbol which is called an indeterminate or, for historical reasons, a variable. In the context of Laurent polynomials, a &quot;Laurent binomial&quot;, often simply called a &quot;binomial&quot;, is similarly defined, but the exponents and may be negative.

More generally, a binomial may be written as:
:formula_2

==Examples==
:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6

==Operations on simple binomials==
*The binomial , the difference of two squares, can be factored as the product of two other binomials:
::formula_7
:This is a special case of the more general formula:
::formula_8
:When working over the complex numbers, this can also be extended to:
::formula_9
*The product of a pair of linear binomials and is a trinomial:
::formula_10
*A binomial raised to the th power, represented as can be expanded by means of the binomial theorem or, equivalently, using Pascal&#x27;s triangle. For example, the square of the binomial is equal to the sum of the squares of the two terms and twice the product of the terms, that is:
::formula_11
:The numbers (1, 2, 1) appearing as multipliers for the terms in this expansion are the binomial coefficients two rows down from the top of Pascal&#x27;s triangle. The expansion of the th power uses the numbers rows down from the top of the triangle.
*An application of the above formula for the square of a binomial is the &quot;-formula&quot; for generating Pythagorean triples:
:For , let , , and ; then .
* Binomials that are sums or differences of cubes can be factored into smaller-degree polynomials as follows:
::formula_12
::formula_13

<text>Goodbye (also called Goodbye Cream) is the fourth and final studio album by Cream, with three tracks recorded live, and three recorded in the studio. The album was released after Cream disbanded in November 1968.

== Background and recording ==
Just before Cream&#x27;s third album, &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot;, was to be released, the group&#x27;s manager Robert Stigwood announced that the group would disband after a farewell tour and a final concert at the Royal Albert Hall in November. The group started their farewell tour on 4 October 1968 in Oakland, California and 15 days later on 19 October the group performed at The Forum in Los Angeles where the three live recordings on &quot;Goodbye&quot; were recorded with Felix Pappalardi and engineers Adrian Barber and Bill Halverson. Just after their farewell tour concluded in November (and just prior to the final Royal Albert Hall show on 26 Nov), Cream recorded three songs over three days at Wally Heider Studios in Los Angeles with producer Felix Pappalardi and engineer Damon Lyon-Shaw, with overdubs at IBC Studios in London a month later. Each of the three songs was penned by a different member of the band. The songs &quot;Badge&quot; and &quot;Doing That Scrapyard Thing&quot; featured Eric Clapton using a Leslie speaker, while all three recordings featured keyboard instruments played by either Jack Bruce or Felix Pappalardi. Present at the Wally Heider sessions on 21 November was George Harrison, credited on the album sleeve for contractual reasons as &quot;L&#x27;Angelo Misterioso&quot;, who contributed rhythm guitar to &quot;Badge&quot;, the song he co-wrote with Clapton. 

In a 1969 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, producer Phil Spector told a possibly apocryphal story about how Atlantic Records head Ahmet Ertegun caused the album to happen: &quot;Like the Cream are breakin&#x27; up, and he said, &#x27;like man you have to do a final album for me.&#x27; They said, &#x27;Why man, we hate each other,&#x27; or somethin&#x27; like that. Ahmet said, &#x27;Oh no man, you have to do one more album for me. Jerry Wexler has cancer, and he’s dyin&#x27; and he wants to hear one more album from you.&#x27; So they go in, make the album and he says, &#x27;Like man, Jerry Wexler isn’t dyin&#x27;, he’s much better, he’s improved.&#x27;”

== Compiling, artwork, and packaging ==
The original plan for &quot;Goodbye&quot; was to make it a double album, with one disc featuring studio recordings and the other with live performances, like &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot;. With a lack of quality material on hand, however, the album was only one disc with three live recordings and three studio recordings.

The original LP release of the album was packaged in a gatefold sleeve with art direction handled by Haig Adishian. The outer sleeve featured photography by Roger Phillips with a cover design by Alan Aldridge Ink Studios featuring the group doing a showbiz soft shuffle with top hats and silver silk tails, while the inner sleeve featured an illustration of a cemetery by Roger Hane that had the song titles on tombstones. A compact disc reissue of the album for the Cream Remasters series in 1998 featured an inlay photograph and had the inner-sleeve illustration in the liner notes of the album.

==Release==
&quot;Goodbye&quot; was released on 5 February 1969 by Atco Records in the United States, debuting in the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart on 15 February and a month later in Europe by Polydor Records. It debuted at No. 1 in the United Kingdom on 15 March, staying in that position for four non-consecutive weeks, and peaked at No. 2 in the United States. A single, &quot;Badge&quot;, was released from the album a month later and hit No. 18 on the UK charts. Interest in the now-defunct group was so intense at this point that the album&#x27;s release pushed two of the group&#x27;s earlier albums, &quot;Fresh Cream&quot; and &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot;, to both peak at No. 7 on the UK chart in late February 1969.

== Critical reception ==

The album was received well by &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, whose Nick Logan wrote an article-long review discussing each track. He praised the version of &quot;I&#x27;m So Glad&quot; for &quot;being as good as they&#x27;ve ever done it and suffice to say the musicianship is stunning&quot;, while noting &quot;Badge&quot; as &quot;compelling listening&quot; and pinpointing &quot;What a Bringdown&quot; as Jack Bruce&#x27;s favorite of the studio tracks. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote &quot;no drum solos on this one, but all three are in superb form&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; was slightly less enthusiastic, stating &quot;a worthwhile souvenir though nothing superastonishing to fill us with desperate regrets it&#x27;s all over&quot;, naming &quot;What a Bringdown&quot; as the best track and &quot;a mild knockout&quot;. Over in America, &quot;Cashbox&quot; penned a short review which simply stated &quot;the group has a reservation for the charts with this set, and should claim it in short order&quot;.

In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, music critic Ray Rezos felt Cream deserved to depart with a better album. He wrote that most of the live songs sounded inferior to the original recordings and that the studio tracks were marred by the same flaw as on &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot;, namely the presence of blues playing on songs whose compositions were not blues in his opinion. Nonetheless, &quot;Goodbye&quot; was voted the 148th best rock album of all time in Paul Gambaccini&#x27;s 1978 poll of 50 prominent American and English rock critics, issued as the book &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice: Top 200 Albums&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called &quot;Goodbye&quot; a work of &quot;hard, heavy rock&quot; and &quot;strong moments&quot; rather than cohesiveness, with live music that is generally better than on &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; and a side of studio recordings that also found Cream &quot;at something of a peak&quot;. Robert Christgau also reacted favourably to the album, citing it as his favourite record from the group. J. D. Considine was less impressed in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (1992), deeming &quot;Goodbye&quot; an incomplete record with &quot;exquisite studio work&quot; but mediocre live performances.

== Track listing ==
* Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1–6 on CD reissues.
Notes:
* [1–3] recorded live at The Forum, Los Angeles, 19 October 1968.
* Original pressings of the album (as well as the single) list composer credit on &quot;Badge&quot; to Clapton alone.
* &quot;Anyone for Tennis&quot; was originally released as a non-album single, as well as by Atco on the soundtrack album to the film &quot;The Savage Seven&quot; (catalogue no. SD 33-245, 1968). The song was subsequently sometimes included on pressings of &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; (1968) and later pressings of &quot;Goodbye&quot; by Polydor.

<doc id="542405" wikidata="Q7100251" url="?curid=542405" title="Orchestra hit">
<text>An orchestra(l) hit or stab is an isolated staccato note or chord synthesized from the sounds of many orchestral instruments together. The orchestra hit sound was propagated by the use of early samplers, particularly the Fairlight CMI&#x27;s ORCH2 sample. The sound is used in pop, hip hop, jazz fusion, techno, and video game genres to accentuate passages of music.

The orchestra hit has been identified as a &quot;hip hop cliché&quot;. In 1990, &quot;Musician&quot; magazine stated that Fairlight&#x27;s ORCH5 sample was &quot;the orchestral hit that was heard on every rap and techno-pop record of the early 1980s&quot;. The orchestra hit has been described as popular music&#x27;s equivalent to the Wilhelm scream, a sound effect widely used in film.

== History ==
Precursors to the popular samples can be found in contemporary classical music, for example in Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Firebird&quot;.

Use of short samples (such as the orchestra hit) became popular in the early 1980s with the advent of digital samplers. These devices allowed sounds to be replayed at specific times and at regular intervals by sequencing, which was extremely difficult through previous methods of tape splicing. Samplers also began to allow sections of audio to be edited and played by a keyboard controller.

The orchestra hit was popularised in Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot; (1982) and used soon after in Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. Other examples of use in popular music include En Vogue&#x27;s &quot;Hold On&quot; (1990) and Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (1985). Yes&#x27;s &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; (1983) used an orchestra hit which was sampled from Funk, Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Kool is Back&quot;. By the mid-1980s, the orchestra hit had become commonplace in hip hop music, and its ubiquitous use became a cliché. Use in other genres extends to jazz funk, where it was used on the title track of Miles Davis&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Tutu&quot;. By the mid-1990s the sound had begun to be used in Caribbean music.

Anne Dudley and Trevor Horn used an orchestra hit with the Art of Noise as a sound effect rather than a melodic instrument. The sample was used in &quot;Close (to the Edit)&quot;, where it was sequenced alongside sound effects of chainsaws, breaking glass and motorcycles. Similarly, the brass orchestra hits in &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; are used as a rhythmic device, rather than an effect to evoke a specific environment (in a similar way to samples in Yes&#x27;s earlier recordings). The stabs in the song may also be substitutes for other instruments in the rhythm section, possibly drum fills, and the use of orchestra hits and other samples is particularly noticeable between the first chorus and the start of the guitar solo. High-pitched versions of the orchestra hit were used in many late 80s and 90s songs in Eastern Europe, for example one notable use there was in the song &quot;&quot; () by Greek singer Thanos Kalliris in 1997.

Orchestra hits are sometimes used in film music to represent loud noises such as closing doors.

== Technical ==
Orchestra hit is defined in the General MIDI sound set. It is assigned voice 56, in the ensemble sub group.

The Fairlight CMI synthesizer included a sampled orchestra hit voice, which was later included in many sample libraries. The voice was given the name ORCH5, and was possibly the first famous orchestra hit sample. The sound was a low-resolution, eight-bit digital sample from a recording of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Firebird Suite&quot; – specifically, the chord that opens the &quot;Infernal Dance&quot; section, pitched down a minor sixth. It was sampled by David Vorhaus. Music magazine &quot;The Wire&quot; suggests that the prototype sample is owned by Vivian Kubrick.

Early orchestra hits were short in duration (often less than a second) both due to the nature of the sound (a staccato note) and the restrictions on sampler memory. A compromise for longer durations would be lower bitrates, which would leave the sample with little timbre.

Fairlight produced a number of orchestra hit samples, including a chord version (TRIAD), a percussion version (ORCHFZ1) and a looped version (ORCH2). Samples ORCH4, ORCH5 and ORCH6 were located on the CMI&#x27;s disk 8, within the STRINGS1 library.

The Chord is an F minor sixth chord.

== Samples ==
The following samples are examples of orchestra hit voices on different sound modules. Each note is played at C4 (see scientific pitch notation).

<doc id="542406" wikidata="Q977134" url="?curid=542406" title="Spark Matsunaga">
<text>Spark Masayuki Matsunaga (, October 8, 1916April 15, 1990) was an American politician and attorney who served as United States Senator for Hawaii from 1977 until his death in 1990. Matsunaga also represented Hawaii in the U.S. House of Representatives and served in the Hawaii territorial house of representatives. A member of the Democratic Party, Matsunaga introduced legislation that led to the creation of the United States Institute of Peace and to reparations to Japanese-American World War II detainees.

==Early life==
Born Masayuki Matsunaga on October 8, 1916, the Territory of Hawaii island of Kauai, Spark Matsunaga was Japanese-American. His parents had emigrated to the United States from Japan. When he was eight, he was nicknamed Sparky after Spark Plug, a character in the comic strip Barney Google and Snuffy Smith. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree with honors in education from the University of Hawaiʻi in 1941.

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, the AJA (Americans of Japanese ancestry) soldiers in the Hawaii National Guard were reorganized into a new Army unit named the Hawaiian Provisional Infantry Battalion. On June 5, 1942, six months after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, a U.S. Army transport ship Maui, quietly departed Honolulu Harbor with the 1,432 men of the unit. On June 12, 1942, just before the Battalion arrived in Oakland, California, the unit learned that it had been redesignated the 100th Infantry Battalion (Separate), meaning they were a separate unit and not part of any regiment or military unit. The men adopted &quot;Remember Pearl Harbor&quot; as their unit&#x27;s motto. The training record of the 100th Infantry Battalion (Sep) at Camp McCoy, plus the service of the Varsity Victory Volunteers in Hawaiʻi, led the War Department to authorize the formation of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team (RCT) on February 1, 1943. Matsunaga was twice wounded in battle in Italy during World War II. He served with the renowned 442nd Regimental Combat Team and was released from the Army as a captain. Matsunaga graduated from Harvard Law School in 1951.

==Political career==

Matsunaga served as a prosecutor and was a member of the Hawaii territorial House of Representatives.

After Daniel Inouye was elected to the Senate, Matsunaga succeeded him as the state&#x27;s sole member of the House of Representatives. After Hawaii was split into districts for the 1970 elections, Matsunaga was elected for , comprising Honolulu&#x27;s inner ring, and held that seat until 1976. That year, with Hiram Fong retiring, Matsunaga defeated Hawaii&#x27;s other House representative, Patsy Mink, for the Democratic Party nomination for Senator. Matsunaga then defeated former Republican governor William Quinn in the general election and went on to serve in the United States Senate from 1977 until his death in 1990.

In 1984, following many years of effort from Matsunaga, Congress passed a bill creating the U.S. Institute for Peace.

For 22 years, Matsunaga presented legislation in Congress for the creation of the position of United States Poet Laureate. In 1985, a bill was finally passed authorizing the position of Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress.

Matsunaga was instrumental in the passage of a redress bill for people of Japanese descent who were detained in the United States during World War II. The $1.25 billion bill provided $20,000 to each detainee and also apologized to the detainees.

Matsunaga was known for his sense of humor. One famous incident involved Matsunaga and then-Secretary of State Alexander Haig at a White House reception for Japanese Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki in 1981. Haig reportedly mistook Matsunaga for a member of the Japanese delegation and asked if he spoke English. Matsunaga replied, &quot;Yes, Mr. Secretary, I do — and I had the honor of voting for your confirmation the other day.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Matsunaga was married to the former Helene Hatsumi Tokunaga and had three daughters and two sons.

Matsunaga had prostate cancer at the end of his life; by January 1990, he announced that the cancer had spread to his bones. He later went to Toronto General Hospital for treatment, and died there on April 15, 1990, at the age of 73. His flag-draped casket lay in state in the rotunda of the State Capitol in Honolulu.

==Legacy==

In 1997, Matsunaga&#x27;s widow donated his papers to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. There were approximately 1200 boxes of material including documents, photographs, videos, and memorabilia from his 28 years in Congress. Also in the papers are professional and personal materials from his pre-Congressional life; especially noteworthy are documents, letters, photographs, and memorabilia from his Army service in the 100th Infantry Battalion.

A bronze statue honoring him is in the Spark M. Matsunaga International Children&#x27;s Garden For Peace at the Storybook Theatre of Hawaii in his hometown of Hanapepe, Kauai. As of 1999, Matsunaga&#x27;s portrait appears on US Series I Bonds in the $10,000 denomination. There is also an elementary school in Germantown, Maryland and a VA Medical Center in Honolulu named after him.

<text>Elías Antonio &quot;Tony&quot; Saca González (born 9 March 1965) is a Salvadoran politician who was President of El Salvador from 1 June 2004 to 1 June 2009. He is currently serving a minimum 10-year prison sentence on corruption charges.

==Early life==
Born in Santa Elena, Usulutan, Saca is of Palestinian descent on his father&#x27;s side, from a family of Catholic immigrants who arrived in El Salvador in the early 20th century from the town of Bethlehem. Saca&#x27;s Muslim maternal grandfather, Musa Ali Saleh, changed his name to Moises Gonzalez. Saca&#x27;s maternal side is the Flores family.

Prior to becoming president, Saca was a broadcast journalist, specializing in sports radio and a prominent businessman. He attended the University of Central America. He is an outspoken Evangelical Protestant and has expressed his faith through his historic friendliness with Salvadoran and American Protestant churches.

Saca married Ana Ligia Mixco Sol de Saca on 11 August 1989. The couple have three children, Gerardo Antonio, Jose Alejandro and Christian Eduardo.

==Presidency (2004-2009)== 

On 21 March 2004, Saca was elected President of El Salvador, and on 1 June 2004 succeeded President Francisco Flores. Both Saca and Flores are members of the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance party, generally known by its Spanish-language acronym ARENA. Like Flores, Saca was part of ARENA&#x27;s moderate wing.

During the election campaign, some commentators criticized Saca&#x27;s lack of political experience. In the election, Saca defeated leftist Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) candidate, Schafik Hándal, also of Arab descent. The election results were:
* Antonio Saca (ARENA) 57.7%
* Schafik Handal (FMLN) 35.6%
* Héctor Silva (CDU-PDC) 3.9%
* Others 2.8%

In August 2004, President of the Republic of China Chen Shui-bian awarded Saca the Order of Brilliant Jade with Grand Cordon.

The ARENA party expelled Saca in December 2009 for his suspected involvement in getting certain ARENA legislators to defect to a new party, the Grand Alliance for National Unity, in cooperation with the ruling FMLN government.

===Policies===
President Saca initiated the &quot;Solidarian Network plan&quot; in October 2005 with international aid from European countries such as Spain. This plan was aimed at communities considered below the poverty line. A map of poor areas was developed, and financial aid in the amount of $15 to $20 per month per family was to be distributed in the designation areas. The plan was initiated in the Balsam Range municipalities (Cordillera del Balsamo), such as Jicalapa, in La Libertad department.

With his embracing of the free-market and pro-United States policies like those pursued by Flores, Saca was the clear favorite of the United States government in the 2004 presidential election. Saca was one of a few leaders in Latin America to send troops to Iraq, though he was the only one to maintain them on extended deployment. El Salvador&#x27;s military commitment in Iraq ended in early 2009.

Many attribute Saca&#x27;s pro-U.S. attitude to the fact that he was openly supported by members of the Republican Party and the George W. Bush Administration during his political campaign in the 2004 elections. In the opinion of many analysts, the U.S. right wing felt confident that Saca would head a conservative government in line with their interests.

The FMLN accused the United States of intervening in the electoral process because several high-ranking officials warned that U.S. relations with El Salvador would be seriously threatened if Handal won the elections. This opinion was reinforced by the fact that ARENA assured that the United States could deport Salvadorans living there if the leftist candidate won.

==Allegations of corruption==
President Saca was the subject of widespread allegations of corruption. A secret cable from the American Embassy in San Salvador, made public by Wikileaks, cites lawmakers from Saca&#x27;s own ARENA party and business figures as raising specific concerns about Saca abusing the power of the presidency for his own personal gain. Such corruption &quot;went beyond the pale&quot; even by Salvadoran standards. According to the cable: &quot;While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behavior by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy (and son of controversial ARENA founder) Roberto D&#x27;Aubuisson told Poloff that Saca “deliberately ignored” his Public Works Minister&#x27;s government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca&#x27;s family business interests.&quot;
The U.S. Embassy cable also made mention of Saca&#x27;s multimillion-dollar mansion constructed during his presidency: &quot;Saca also accumulated conspicuous assets – including a mansion in San Salvador and large landholdings in La Union that do not square with the investments and income he had prior to assuming the presidency.&quot;

Another classified U.S. Embassy cable reported that ARENA expelled Saca, &quot;charging that he had misspent $219 million of unaccounted-for government funds, and citing improprieties in the 2008-2009 electoral process, claiming Saca had pressured mayors to vote for specified candidates under penalty of being excluded as ARENA municipal candidates.&quot; The ARENA leadership, according to the cable, &quot;said Saca improperly transferred government funds to bolster his own image, despite funding shortages for public health and safety. Saca defended himself in a December 13 telephone interview with center-left online newspaper El Faro . . . . He also claimed the funding transfer was authorized by law.&quot;

In the midst of a political campaign, the former president was sued on 21 October 2013 for corruption and money laundering. On 7 March 2016, the El Salvador Supreme Court ordered Saca to stand trial for illegal enrichment. On 12 September 2018, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison by a tribunal.

==2014 presidential election==
Saca was a candidate in the 2 February 2014 elections. Though he leans politically to the right, Saca and the deputies aligned with him have often allied with the FMLN in the National Assembly to vote against ARENA, offering Saca a degree of political influence. He was running as part of a coalition of small parties called UNIDAD, which included groups from both the center-left and center-right, but was not expected to win. In fact, he lost.

==Operation &quot;Destape a la Corrupción&quot;==
In the night of Saturday, 29 October 2016, Saca, was captured on alleged corruption charges by the police; according to the Prosecutor, Saca has been arrested for alleged illicit enrichment, unlawful association, and money laundering. Julio Rank (ex-secretary of communications), Cesar Funes (ex-secretary of the youth), and four other former officials in his government were also arrested. Prosecutor has accused him and the others for diverting from the public coffers a total of $246 million.

The initial hearing was held in the Fourth Court of Peace of San Salvador, in three sessions, one per day, resulting that on Saturday, 5 November, the Judge ordered the continuation of the process to the stage of investigation and the detention of those involved, including Saca.

==Conviction and imprisonment==
On 12 September 2018, Saca received a 10-year prison sentence after he pled guilty to embezzlement and money laundering charges involving more than $300 million of public funds. On 18 September 2019, Saca received two more years in prison after pleading guilty to attempting to bribe a court employee with around $10,000 in exchange for information concerning a charge brought against him. At the time of his second conviction, Saca was already serving his 10-year prison sentence. The Salvadoran Supreme Court upheld Saca&#x27;s 10-year prison sentence on 26 December 2019, and also ordered him to return some $260 million that he embezzled. The Supreme Court also upheld convictions against three former officials from Saca&#x27;s inner circle and three his former presidential employees, and also ordered them to return stolen money as well. Saca&#x27;s six co-defendants had received prison sentences ranging from 3 to 16 years.

On 5 January 2021, both Saca and his wife Ana Ligia de Saca were convicted of illicit enrichment and were order to repay the Salvadoran government $4.4 million. On 4 June 2021, Ana Ligia de Saca and her brother Oscar Edgardo Sol Mixco would be sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of money laundering and were ordered to repay $17.6 million to the Salvadoran government.

<doc id="542410" wikidata="Q137165" url="?curid=542410" title="Thermus aquaticus">
<text>Thermus aquaticus is a species of bacteria that can tolerate high temperatures, one of several thermophilic bacteria that belong to the &quot;Deinococcota&quot; phylum. It is the source of the heat-resistant enzyme &quot;Taq&quot; DNA polymerase, one of the most important enzymes in molecular biology because of its use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA amplification technique.

==History==

When studies of biological organisms in hot springs began in the 1960s, scientists thought that the life of thermophilic bacteria could not be sustained in temperatures above about . Soon, however, it was discovered that many bacteria in different springs not only survived, but also thrived in higher temperatures. In 1969, Thomas D. Brock and Hudson Freeze of Indiana University reported a new species of thermophilic bacteria which they named &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot;. The bacterium was first isolated from Mushroom Spring in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park, which is near the major Great Fountain Geyser and White Dome Geyser, and has since been found in similar thermal habitats around the world.
Decades later, this discovery had profound implications, including the invention of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) by biochemist Kary Mullis, which revolutionized DNA research and earned Mullis a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993. PCR facilitated advancements in medical diagnostics, genetics, and other fields. After Kary Mullis&#x27; discovery of PCR, Cetus awarded him $10,000. However, Cetus later sold the PCR patent to F. Hoffmann-La Roche (Roche) for $300 million. This transaction left Mullis feeling cheated throughout his life. Roche has since profited immensely from the PCR patent, with annual PCR-related sales reaching $5.4 billion in 2022. Despite these profits, neither the National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park, nor the state of Wyoming have received any share of these revenues. Recognizing the scientific and financial potential of Yellowstone&#x27;s extremophiles, biotechnology companies like Diversa signed agreements with the National Park Service for bioprospecting. This led to further scientific exploration and potential commercial applications, despite some environmental concerns. Overall, Brock&#x27;s initial discovery in Yellowstone&#x27;s hot springs paved the way for significant scientific breakthroughs, demonstrating the importance of basic research in driving innovation and technological advancements.

==Biology==
&quot;T. aquaticus&quot; shows best growth at , but can survive at temperatures of . It primarily scavenges for protein from its environment as is evidenced by the large number of extracellular and intracellular proteases and peptidases as well as transport proteins for amino acids and oligopeptides across its cell membrane. This bacterium is a chemotroph—it performs chemosynthesis to obtain food. However, since its range of temperature overlaps somewhat with that of the photosynthetic cyanobacteria that share its ideal environment, it is sometimes found living jointly with its neighbors, obtaining energy for growth from their photosynthesis. &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; normally respires aerobically but one of its strains, &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot; Y51MC23, is able to be grown anaerobically.

The genetic material of &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; consists of one chromosome and four plasmids, and its complete genome sequencing revealed that it contains two full and two partial prophages, as well as numerous CRISPR loci.

==Morphology==
&quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot; is generally of cylindrical shape with a diameter of 0.5 μm to 0.8 μm. The shorter rod shape has a length of 5 μm to 10 μm. The longer filament shape has a length that varies greatly and in some cases exceeds 200 μm. &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; has shown multiple possible morphologies in different cultures, rod-shaped or as short filaments. The rod-shaped bacteria have a tendency to aggregate. Associations of several individuals can lead to the formation of spherical bodies 10 μm to 20 μm in diameter, also called rotund bodies. These bodies are not composed of cell envelope or outer membrane components as previously thought, but are instead made from remodelled peptidoglycan cell wall. Their exact function in the survival of &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; remains unknown but has been theorised to include temporary food and nucleotide storage, or they may play a role in the attachment and organisation of colonies.
Thermus aquaticus is a typical gram-negative bacterium, which indicates that its cell walls have considerably less peptidoglycan compared to gram-positive counterparts. In the presence of sunlight, Thermus can display hues ranging from yellow to pink or red, which are visible in hot springs. Additionally, Thermus aquaticus may possess flagella for motility or remain immotile.

==Enzymes from &quot;T. aquaticus&quot;==
&quot;T. aquaticus&quot; has become famous as a source of thermostable enzymes, particularly the &quot;Taq&quot; DNA polymerase, as described below.

===Aldolase===
Studies of this extreme thermophilic bacterium that could be grown in cell culture was initially centered on attempts to understand how enzymes, which are normally inactive at high temperature, can function at high temperature in thermophiles. In 1970, Freeze and Brock published an article describing a thermostable aldolase enzyme from &quot;T. aquaticus&quot;.

===RNA polymerase===
The first polymerase enzyme isolated from &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; in 1974 was a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, used in the process of transcription.

===&quot;Taq&quot; I restriction enzyme===

Most molecular biologists probably became aware of &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; in the late 1970s or early 1980s because of the isolation of useful restriction endonucleases from this organism. Use of the term &quot;Taq&quot; to refer to &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot; arose at this time from the convention of giving restriction enzymes short names, such as Sal and Hin, derived from the genus and species of the source organisms.

===DNA polymerase (&quot;Taq pol&quot;)===

DNA polymerase was first isolated from &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; in 1976. The first advantage found for this thermostable (temperature optimum 72°C, does not denature even in 95 °C) DNA polymerase was that it could be isolated in a purer form (free of other enzyme contaminants) than could the DNA polymerase from other sources. Later, Kary Mullis and other investigators at Cetus Corporation discovered this enzyme could be used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process for amplifying short segments of DNA, eliminating the need to add E. coli polymerase enzymes after every cycle of thermal denaturation of the DNA. The enzyme was also cloned, sequenced, modified (to produce the shorter &#x27;Stoffel fragment&#x27;), and produced in large quantities for commercial sale. In 1989 &quot;Science&quot; magazine named Taq polymerase as its first &quot;Molecule of the Year&quot;. In 1993, Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work with PCR.

===Other enzymes===
The high optimum temperature for &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; allows researchers to study reactions under conditions for which other enzymes lose activity. Other enzymes isolated from this organism include DNA ligase, alkaline phosphatase, NADH oxidase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, amylomaltase, and fructose 1,6-disphosphate-dependent L-lactate dehydrogenase.

==Controversy==
The commercial use of enzymes from &quot;T. aquaticus&quot; has not been without controversy. After Brock&#x27;s studies, samples of the organism were deposited in the American Type Culture Collection, a public repository. Other scientists, including those at Cetus, obtained it from there. As the commercial potential of &quot;Taq&quot; polymerase became apparent in the 1990s, the National Park Service labeled its use as the &quot;Great &quot;Taq&quot; Rip-off&quot;. Researchers working in National Parks are now required to sign &quot;benefits sharing&quot; agreements that would send a portion of later profits back to the Park Service.

<text>In commutative algebra, Krull&#x27;s principal ideal theorem, named after Wolfgang Krull (1899–1971), gives a bound on the height of a principal ideal in a commutative Noetherian ring. The theorem is sometimes referred to by its German name, &quot;Krulls Hauptidealsatz&quot; (from &#x27; (&quot;Principal&quot;) +&#x27; + &quot;&quot; (&quot;theorem&quot;)).

Precisely, if &quot;R&quot; is a Noetherian ring and &quot;I&quot; is a principal, proper ideal of &quot;R&quot;, then each minimal prime ideal containing &quot;I&quot; has height at most one.

This theorem can be generalized to ideals that are not principal, and the result is often called Krull&#x27;s height theorem. This says that if &quot;R&quot; is a Noetherian ring and &quot;I&quot; is a proper ideal generated by &quot;n&quot; elements of &quot;R&quot;, then each minimal prime over &quot;I&quot; has height at most &quot;n&quot;. The converse is also true: if a prime ideal has height &quot;n&quot;, then it is a minimal prime ideal over an ideal generated by &quot;n&quot; elements.

The principal ideal theorem and the generalization, the height theorem, both follow from the fundamental theorem of dimension theory in commutative algebra (see also below for the direct proofs). Bourbaki&#x27;s &quot;Commutative Algebra&quot; gives a direct proof. Kaplansky&#x27;s &quot;Commutative Rings&quot; includes a proof due to David Rees.

== Proofs ==
=== Proof of the principal ideal theorem ===
Let formula_1 be a Noetherian ring, &quot;x&quot; an element of it and formula_2 a minimal prime over &quot;x&quot;. Replacing &quot;A&quot; by the localization formula_3, we can assume formula_1 is local with the maximal ideal formula_2. Let formula_6 be a strictly smaller prime ideal and let formula_7, which is a formula_8-primary ideal called the &quot;n&quot;-th symbolic power of formula_8. It forms a descending chain of ideals formula_10. Thus, there is the descending chain of ideals formula_11 in the ring formula_12. Now, the radical formula_13 is the intersection of all minimal prime ideals containing formula_14; formula_2 is among them. But formula_2 is a unique maximal ideal and thus formula_17. Since formula_18 contains some power of its radical, it follows that formula_19 is an Artinian ring and thus the chain formula_11 stabilizes and so there is some &quot;n&quot; such that formula_21. It implies:
:formula_22,

from the fact formula_23 is formula_8-primary (if formula_25 is in formula_23, then formula_27 with formula_28 and formula_29. Since formula_2 is minimal over formula_14, formula_32 and so formula_33 implies formula_34 is in formula_23.) Now, quotienting out both sides by formula_36 yields formula_37. Then, by Nakayama&#x27;s lemma (which says a finitely generated module &quot;M&quot; is zero if formula_38 for some ideal &quot;I&quot; contained in the radical), we get formula_39; i.e., formula_40 and thus formula_41. Using Nakayama&#x27;s lemma again, formula_42 and formula_43 is an Artinian ring; thus, the height of formula_8 is zero. formula_45

=== Proof of the height theorem ===
Krull’s height theorem can be proved as a consequence of the principal ideal theorem by induction on the number of elements. Let formula_46 be elements in formula_1, formula_2 a minimal prime over formula_49 and formula_6 a prime ideal such that there is no prime strictly between them. Replacing formula_1 by the localization formula_52 we can assume formula_53 is a local ring; note we then have formula_54. By minimality of formula_2, it follows that formula_8 cannot contain all the formula_57; relabeling the subscripts, say, formula_58. Since every prime ideal containing formula_59 is between formula_8 and formula_2, formula_62 and thus we can write for each formula_63,
:formula_64
with formula_65 and formula_66. Now we consider the ring formula_67 and the corresponding chain formula_68 in it. If formula_69 is a minimal prime over formula_70, then formula_71 contains formula_72 and thus formula_73; that is to say, formula_74 is a minimal prime over formula_70 and so, by Krull’s principal ideal theorem, formula_76 is a minimal prime (over zero); formula_8 is a minimal prime over formula_78. By inductive hypothesis, formula_79 and thus formula_80. formula_45

<text>Charles Elmer Hires (August 19, 1851 – July 31, 1937) was an American pharmacist and an early promoter of commercially prepared root beer. He founded the Charles E. Hires Co., which manufactured and distributed Hires Root Beer.

==Early life==
Hires was born on August 19, 1851, to John and Mary Hires in the Roadstown section of Hopewell Township, New Jersey. At age 12, his parents sent him to work as an apprentice at a drugstore owned by his brothers-in-law. When he was 16, he moved to Philadelphia, where he worked in a pharmacy. He saved until he had nearly $400, when he started his own drugstore.

==Career==
Hires reportedly learned about root beer on his honeymoon in New Jersey, where the woman who ran the hotel served an herbal tea made from roots known as &quot;root tea&quot;. His friend Russell Conwell, who went on to found Temple University, suggested that &quot;root beer&quot; would be more appealing to the working class. Hires packaged a dry mixture in boxes and sold it to housewives and proprietors of soda fountains. They needed to mix in water, sugar, and yeast.

The drink was slow to catch on, but Conwell persuaded Hires to present his product at the 1876 U.S. Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. To make it stand out, he called his drink &quot;the temperance drink&quot; and &quot;the greatest health-giving beverage in the world.&quot; Soon after, business flourished and Hires opened a factory at 117-119 Arch Street in Philadelphia.

Hires did not drink and marketed root beer as an alternative to alcohol. Following an analysis that suggested there was alcohol in root beer, the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union launched a boycott of his product. Hires ran his own analysis and advertised heavily that the amount of alcohol was about the same as in a half loaf of bread.

==Personal life==
Hires married Clara Kate Smith in 1875. After her death in 1910, he married Emma Waln. 

==Death==
Hires died from a stroke at his home in Haverford, Pennsylvania, on July 31, 1937, at the age of 85. Melrose, the family&#x27;s estate in Merion Station, Pennsylvania, is now the site of Temple Adath Israel of the Main Line.

<doc id="542431" wikidata="Q2444982" url="?curid=542431" title="Noetherian module">
<text>In abstract algebra, a Noetherian module is a module that satisfies the ascending chain condition on its submodules, where the submodules are partially ordered by inclusion.

Historically, Hilbert was the first mathematician to work with the properties of finitely generated submodules. He proved an important theorem known as Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem which says that any ideal in the multivariate polynomial ring of an arbitrary field is finitely generated. However, the property is named after Emmy Noether who was the first one to discover the true importance of the property.

==Characterizations and properties==

In the presence of the axiom of choice, two other characterizations are possible: 
*Any nonempty set &quot;S&quot; of submodules of the module has a maximal element (with respect to set inclusion). This is known as the maximum condition.
*All of the submodules of the module are finitely generated.

If &quot;M&quot; is a module and &quot;K&quot; a submodule, then &quot;M&quot; is Noetherian if and only if &quot;K&quot; and &quot;M&quot;/&quot;K&quot; are Noetherian. This is in contrast to the general situation with finitely generated modules: a submodule of a finitely generated module need not be finitely generated.

==Examples==
*The integers, considered as a module over the ring of integers, is a Noetherian module.
*If &quot;R&quot; = M&quot;n&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) is the full matrix ring over a field, and &quot;M&quot; = M&quot;n&quot; 1(&quot;F&quot;) is the set of column vectors over &quot;F&quot;, then &quot;M&quot; can be made into a module using matrix multiplication by elements of &quot;R&quot; on the left of elements of &quot;M&quot;. This is a Noetherian module.
*Any module that is finite as a set is Noetherian.
*Any finitely generated right module over a right Noetherian ring is a Noetherian module.

==Use in other structures==
A right Noetherian ring &quot;R&quot; is, by definition, a Noetherian right &quot;R&quot;-module over itself using multiplication on the right. Likewise a ring is called left Noetherian ring when &quot;R&quot; is Noetherian considered as a left &quot;R&quot;-module. When &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring the left-right adjectives may be dropped as they are unnecessary. Also, if &quot;R&quot; is Noetherian on both sides, it is customary to call it Noetherian and not &quot;left and right Noetherian&quot;.
The Noetherian condition can also be defined on bimodule structures as well: a Noetherian bimodule is a bimodule whose poset of sub-bimodules satisfies the ascending chain condition. Since a sub-bimodule of an &quot;R&quot;-&quot;S&quot; bimodule &quot;M&quot; is in particular a left &quot;R&quot;-module, if &quot;M&quot; considered as a left &quot;R&quot;-module were Noetherian, then &quot;M&quot; is automatically a Noetherian bimodule. It may happen, however, that a bimodule is Noetherian without its left or right structures being Noetherian.

<text>In information theory, the information content, self-information, surprisal, or Shannon information is a basic quantity derived from the probability of a particular event occurring from a random variable. It can be thought of as an alternative way of expressing probability, much like odds or log-odds, but which has particular mathematical advantages in the setting of information theory.

The Shannon information can be interpreted as quantifying the level of &quot;surprise&quot; of a particular outcome. As it is such a basic quantity, it also appears in several other settings, such as the length of a message needed to transmit the event given an optimal source coding of the random variable.

The Shannon information is closely related to &quot;entropy&quot;, which is the expected value of the self-information of a random variable, quantifying how surprising the random variable is &quot;on average&quot;. This is the average amount of self-information an observer would expect to gain about a random variable when measuring it.

The information content can be expressed in various units of information, of which the most common is the &quot;bit&quot; (more formally called the &quot;shannon&quot;), as explained below.

The term &#x27;perplexity&#x27; has been used in language modelling to quantify the uncertainty inherent in a set of prospective events.

== Definition ==
Claude Shannon&#x27;s definition of self-information was chosen to meet several axioms:

# An event with probability 100% is perfectly unsurprising and yields no information.
# The less probable an event is, the more surprising it is and the more information it yields.
# If two independent events are measured separately, the total amount of information is the sum of the self-informations of the individual events.

The detailed derivation is below, but it can be shown that there is a unique function of probability that meets these three axioms, up to a multiplicative scaling factor. Broadly, given a real number formula_1 and an event formula_2 with probability formula_3, the information content is defined as follows:
formula_4

The base &quot;b&quot; corresponds to the scaling factor above. Different choices of &quot;b&quot; correspond to different units of information: when , the unit is the shannon (symbol Sh), often called a &#x27;bit&#x27;; when , the unit is the natural unit of information (symbol nat); and when , the unit is the hartley (symbol Hart).

Formally, given a discrete random variable formula_5 with probability mass function formula_6, the self-information of measuring formula_5 as outcome formula_2 is defined as
formula_9

The use of the notation formula_10 for self-information above is not universal. Since the notation formula_11 is also often used for the related quantity of mutual information, many authors use a lowercase formula_12 for self-entropy instead, mirroring the use of the capital formula_13 for the entropy.

For a given probability space, the measurement of rarer events are intuitively more &quot;surprising&quot;, and yield more information content, than more common values. Thus, self-information is a strictly decreasing monotonic function of the probability, or sometimes called an &quot;antitonic&quot; function.

While standard probabilities are represented by real numbers in the interval formula_14, self-informations are represented by extended real numbers in the interval formula_15. In particular, we have the following, for any choice of logarithmic base:

* If a particular event has a 100% probability of occurring, then its self-information is formula_16: its occurrence is &quot;perfectly non-surprising&quot; and yields no information.
* If a particular event has a 0% probability of occurring, then its self-information is formula_17: its occurrence is &quot;infinitely surprising&quot;.

From this, we can get a few general properties:

* Intuitively, more information is gained from observing an unexpected event—it is &quot;surprising&quot;. 
** For example, if there is a chance of Alice winning the lottery, her friend Bob will gain significantly more information from learning that she won than that she lost on a given day. (See also &quot;Lottery mathematics&quot;.)
* This establishes an implicit relationship between the self-information of a random variable and its variance.

=== Relationship to log-odds ===
The Shannon information is closely related to the log-odds. In particular, given some event formula_2, suppose that formula_19 is the probability of formula_2 occurring, and that formula_21 is the probability of formula_2 not occurring. Then we have the following definition of the log-odds:
formula_23

This can be expressed as a difference of two Shannon informations:
formula_24

In other words, the log-odds can be interpreted as the level of surprise when the event &quot;doesn&#x27;t&quot; happen, minus the level of surprise when the event &quot;does&quot; happen.

=== Additivity of independent events ===
The information content of two independent events is the sum of each event&#x27;s information content. This property is known as additivity in mathematics, and sigma additivity in particular in measure and probability theory. Consider two independent random variables formula_25 with probability mass functions formula_26 and formula_27 respectively. The joint probability mass function is

formula_28

because formula_29 and formula_30 are independent. The information content of the outcome formula_31 isformula_32
See &quot;&quot; below for an example.

The corresponding property for likelihoods is that the log-likelihood of independent events is the sum of the log-likelihoods of each event. Interpreting log-likelihood as &quot;support&quot; or negative surprisal (the degree to which an event supports a given model: a model is supported by an event to the extent that the event is unsurprising, given the model), this states that independent events add support: the information that the two events together provide for statistical inference is the sum of their independent information.

==Relationship to entropy==
The Shannon entropy of the random variable formula_33 above is defined as
formula_34
by definition equal to the expected information content of measurement of formula_33.
The expectation is taken over the discrete values over its support. 

Sometimes, the entropy itself is called the &quot;self-information&quot; of the random variable, possibly because the entropy satisfies formula_36, where formula_37 is the mutual information of formula_5 with itself.

For continuous random variables the corresponding concept is differential entropy.

== Notes ==
This measure has also been called surprisal, as it represents the &quot;surprise&quot; of seeing the outcome (a highly improbable outcome is very surprising). This term (as a log-probability measure) was introduced by Edward W. Samson in his 1951 report &quot;Fundamental natural concepts of information theory&quot;. An early appearance in the Physics literature is in Myron Tribus&#x27; 1961 book &quot;Thermostatics and Thermodynamics&quot;.

When the event is a random realization (of a variable) the self-information of the variable is defined as the expected value of the self-information of the realization.

==Examples==

=== Fair coin toss ===
Consider the Bernoulli trial of tossing a fair coin formula_5. The probabilities of the events of the coin landing as heads formula_40 and tails formula_41 (see fair coin and obverse and reverse) are one half each, formula_42. Upon measuring the variable as heads, the associated information gain is
formula_43so the information gain of a fair coin landing as heads is 1 shannon. Likewise, the information gain of measuring tails formula_44 isformula_45

=== Fair die roll ===
Suppose we have a fair six-sided die. The value of a dice roll is a discrete uniform random variable formula_46 with probability mass function formula_47The probability of rolling a 4 is formula_48, as for any other valid roll. The information content of rolling a 4 is thusformula_49of information.

=== Two independent, identically distributed dice ===
Suppose we have two independent, identically distributed random variables formula_50 each corresponding to an independent fair 6-sided dice roll. The joint distribution of formula_5 and formula_52 isformula_53

The information content of the random variate formula_54 is
formula_55
and can also be calculated by additivity of events
formula_56

==== Information from frequency of rolls ====
If we receive information about the value of the dice without knowledge of which die had which value, we can formalize the approach with so-called counting variables
formula_57
for formula_58, then formula_59 and the counts have the multinomial distribution
formula_60

To verify this, the 6 outcomes formula_61 correspond to the event formula_62 and a total probability of . These are the only events that are faithfully preserved with identity of which dice rolled which outcome because the outcomes are the same. Without knowledge to distinguish the dice rolling the other numbers, the other formula_63 combinations correspond to one die rolling one number and the other die rolling a different number, each having probability . Indeed, formula_64, as required.

Unsurprisingly, the information content of learning that both dice were rolled as the same particular number is more than the information content of learning that one dice was one number and the other was a different number. Take for examples the events formula_65 and formula_66 for formula_67. For example, formula_68 and formula_69.

The information contents are
formula_70
formula_71

Let formula_72 be the event that both dice rolled the same value and formula_73 be the event that the dice differed. Then formula_74 and formula_75. The information contents of the events are
formula_76
formula_77

==== Information from sum of die ====

The probability mass or density function (collectively probability measure) of the sum of two independent random variables is the convolution of each probability measure. In the case of independent fair 6-sided dice rolls, the random variable formula_78 has probability mass function formula_79, where formula_80 represents the discrete convolution. The outcome formula_81 has probability formula_82. Therefore, the information asserted isformula_83

=== General discrete uniform distribution ===

Generalizing the example above, consider a general discrete uniform random variable (DURV) formula_84 For convenience, define formula_85. The probability mass function is formula_86In general, the values of the DURV need not be integers, or for the purposes of information theory even uniformly spaced; they need only be equiprobable. The information gain of any observation formula_87 isformula_88

==== Special case: constant random variable ====
If formula_89 above, formula_5 degenerates to a constant random variable with probability distribution deterministically given by formula_91 and probability measure the Dirac measure formula_92. The only value formula_5 can take is deterministically formula_94, so the information content of any measurement of formula_5 isformula_96In general, there is no information gained from measuring a known value.

=== Categorical distribution ===
Generalizing all of the above cases, consider a categorical discrete random variable with support formula_97 and probability mass function given by

formula_98

For the purposes of information theory, the values formula_99 do not have to be numbers; they can be any mutually exclusive events on a measure space of finite measure that has been normalized to a probability measure formula_100. Without loss of generality, we can assume the categorical distribution is supported on the set formula_101; the mathematical structure is isomorphic in terms of probability theory and therefore information theory as well.

The information of the outcome formula_102 is given

formula_103

From these examples, it is possible to calculate the information of any set of independent DRVs with known distributions by additivity.

==Derivation==
By definition, information is transferred from an originating entity possessing the information to a receiving entity only when the receiver had not known the information a priori. If the receiving entity had previously known the content of a message with certainty before receiving the message, the amount of information of the message received is zero. Only when the advance knowledge of the content of the message by the receiver is less than 100% certain does the message actually convey information.

For example, quoting a character (the Hippy Dippy Weatherman) of comedian George Carlin:&quot;Weather forecast for tonight: dark.&quot; 

&quot;Continued dark overnight, with widely scattered light by morning.&quot; Assuming that one does not reside near the polar regions, the amount of information conveyed in that forecast is zero because it is known, in advance of receiving the forecast, that darkness always comes with the night.

Accordingly, the amount of self-information contained in a message conveying content informing an occurrence of event, formula_104, depends only on the probability of that event.

formula_105
for some function formula_106 to be determined below. If formula_107, then formula_108. If formula_109, then formula_110.

Further, by definition, the measure of self-information is nonnegative and additive. If a message informing of event formula_111 is the intersection of two independent events formula_112 and formula_113, then the information of event formula_111 occurring is that of the compound message of both independent events formula_112 and formula_113 occurring. The quantity of information of compound message formula_111 would be expected to equal the sum of the amounts of information of the individual component messages formula_112 and formula_113 respectively:
formula_120

Because of the independence of events formula_112 and formula_113, the probability of event formula_111 is
formula_124

However, applying function formula_106 results in
formula_126

Thanks to work on Cauchy&#x27;s functional equation, the only monotone functions formula_106 having the property such that
formula_128
are the logarithm functions formula_129. The only operational difference between logarithms of different bases is that of different scaling constants, so we may assume

formula_130

where formula_131 is the natural logarithm. Since the probabilities of events are always between 0 and 1 and the information associated with these events must be nonnegative, that requires that formula_132.

Taking into account these properties, the self-information formula_133 associated with outcome formula_104 with probability formula_135 is defined as:
formula_136

The smaller the probability of event formula_104, the larger the quantity of self-information associated with the message that the event indeed occurred. If the above logarithm is base 2, the unit of formula_138 is shannon. This is the most common practice. When using the natural logarithm of base formula_139, the unit will be the nat. For the base 10 logarithm, the unit of information is the hartley.

As a quick illustration, the information content associated with an outcome of 4 heads (or any specific outcome) in 4 consecutive tosses of a coin would be 4 shannons (probability 1/16), and the information content associated with getting a result other than the one specified would be ~0.09 shannons (probability 15/16). See above for detailed examples.

<text>In geometry, a locus (plural: &quot;loci&quot;) (Latin word for &quot;place&quot;, &quot;location&quot;) is a set of all points (commonly, a line, a line segment, a curve or a surface), whose location satisfies or is determined by one or more specified conditions.

The set of the points that satisfy some property is often called the &quot;locus of a point&quot; satisfying this property. The use of the singular in this formulation is a witness that, until the end of the 19th century, mathematicians did not consider infinite sets. Instead of viewing lines and curves as sets of points, they viewed them as places where a point may be &quot;located&quot; or may move.

==History and philosophy==
Until the beginning of the 20th century, a geometrical shape (for example a curve) was not considered as an infinite set of points; rather, it was considered as an entity on which a point may be located or on which it moves. Thus a circle in the Euclidean plane was defined as the &quot;locus&quot; of a point that is at a given distance of a fixed point, the center of the circle. In modern mathematics, similar concepts are more frequently reformulated by describing shapes as sets; for instance, one says that the circle is the set of points that are at a given distance from the center.

In contrast to the set-theoretic view, the old formulation avoids considering infinite collections, as avoiding the actual infinite was an important philosophical position of earlier mathematicians.

Once set theory became the universal basis over which the whole mathematics is built, the term of locus became rather old-fashioned. Nevertheless, the word is still widely used, mainly for a concise formulation, for example:
* &quot;Critical locus&quot;, the set of the critical points of a differentiable function.
* &quot;Zero locus&quot; or &quot;vanishing locus&quot;, the set of points where a function vanishes, in that it takes the value zero.
* &quot;Singular locus&quot;, the set of the singular points of an algebraic variety.
* &quot;Connectedness locus&quot;, the subset of the parameter set of a family of rational functions for which the Julia set of the function is connected.

More recently, techniques such as the theory of schemes, and the use of category theory instead of set theory to give a foundation to mathematics, have returned to notions more like the original definition of a locus as an object in itself rather than as a set of points.

==Examples in plane geometry==
Examples from plane geometry include:
* The set of points equidistant from two points is a perpendicular bisector to the line segment connecting the two points.
* The set of points equidistant from two intersecting lines is the union of their two angle bisectors.
* All conic sections are loci:
** Circle: the set of points at constant distance (the radius) from a fixed point (the center).
** Parabola: the set of points equidistant from a fixed point (the focus) and a line (the directrix).
** Hyperbola: the set of points for each of which the absolute value of the difference between the distances to two given foci is a constant.
** Ellipse: the set of points for each of which the sum of the distances to two given foci is a constant

Other examples of loci appear in various areas of mathematics. For example, in complex dynamics, the Mandelbrot set is a subset of the complex plane that may be characterized as the connectedness locus of a family of polynomial maps.

==Proof of a locus==
To prove a geometric shape is the correct locus for a given set of conditions, 
one generally divides the proof into two stages: the proof that all the points that satisfy the conditions are on the given shape, and the proof that all the points on the given shape satisfy the conditions.

== Examples ==
===First example===
Find the locus of a point &quot;P&quot; that has a given ratio of distances &quot;k&quot; = &quot;d&quot;1/&quot;d&quot;2 to two given points.

In this example &quot;k&quot; = 3, &quot;A&quot;(−1, 0) and &quot;B&quot;(0, 2) are chosen as the fixed points.

: &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is a point of the locus
: formula_1
: formula_2
: formula_3
: formula_4
: formula_5

This equation represents a circle with center (1/8, 9/4) and radius formula_6. It is the circle of Apollonius defined by these values of &quot;k&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;B&quot;.

===Second example===

A triangle &quot;ABC&quot; has a fixed side [&quot;AB&quot;] with length &quot;c&quot;. 
Determine the locus of the third vertex &quot;C&quot; such that
the medians from &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are orthogonal.

Choose an orthonormal coordinate system such that &quot;A&quot;(−&quot;c&quot;/2, 0), &quot;B&quot;(&quot;c&quot;/2, 0). 
&quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is the variable third vertex. The center of [&quot;BC&quot;] is &quot;M&quot;((2&quot;x&quot; + &quot;c&quot;)/4, &quot;y&quot;/2). The median from &quot;C&quot; has a slope &quot;y&quot;/&quot;x&quot;. The median &quot;AM&quot; has slope 2&quot;y&quot;/(2&quot;x&quot; + 3&quot;c&quot;).
:&quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is a point of the locus
:formula_7 the medians from &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are orthogonal
:formula_8 
:formula_9 
:formula_10 
:formula_11

The locus of the vertex &quot;C&quot; is a circle with center (−3&quot;c&quot;/4, 0) and radius 3&quot;c&quot;/4.

===Third example===

A locus can also be defined by two associated curves depending on one common parameter. If the parameter varies, the intersection points of the associated curves describe the locus.

In the figure, the points &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are fixed points on a given line &quot;m&quot;. The line &quot;k&quot; is a variable line through &quot;K&quot;. The line &quot;l&quot; through &quot;L&quot; is perpendicular to &quot;k&quot;. The angle formula_12 between &quot;k&quot; and &quot;m&quot; is the parameter.
&quot;k&quot; and &quot;l&quot; are associated lines depending on the common parameter. The variable intersection point &quot;S&quot; of &quot;k&quot; and &quot;l&quot; describes a circle. This circle is the locus of the intersection point of the two associated lines.

===Fourth example===

A locus of points need not be one-dimensional (as a circle, line, etc.). For example, the locus of the inequality is the portion of the plane that is below the line of equation .

<doc id="542471" wikidata="Q608708" url="?curid=542471" title="RÚV">
<text>Ríkisútvarpið (, ; abbr. RÚV ) is Iceland&#x27;s national public-service broadcasting organization.

Founded in 1930, it operates from studios in the country&#x27;s capital, Reykjavík, as well as regional centres around the country. RÚV operates an online news service, which is the fourth most visited website in Iceland. In 2016, 88% of Icelanders consumed RÚV content every week.

The service broadcasts an assortment of general programming to a wide national audience via two broadcast radio stations: Rás 1 and Rás 2; and one full-time television channel of the same name, RÚV. A supplementary, part-time TV channel, RÚV 2, transmits live coverage of major cultural and sporting events, as required, as well as some Icelandic programmes with English subtitles. RÚV also distributes online-only channels content for children and the elderly. 

RÚV is funded by a flat earmarked government tax collected from every income tax payer, as well as from on-air advertising. All of RÚV&#x27;s content is free-to-air and open in Iceland.

==History==
The Icelandic National Broadcasting Service commenced operations in 1930 with the launch of Icelandic state radio, &quot;Útvarp Reykjavík&quot; (Radio Reykjavík). RÚV has been a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union since 1956. 

=== Radio ===

==== Longwave broadcasts ====

RÚV began radio broadcasting on longwave in 1930 at Vatnsendhæð, near Reykjavík. In 1938, the transmitted power was increased 100kW. In 1991, the original 1930 longwave transmitter tower at Vatnsendi collapsed. As a result, later in the decade the Hellissandur longwave transmitter was taken into use at 189 kHz, converted from a LORAN-C mast, making it Western Europe&#x27;s tallest radio mast at its time of closure.

In 1938, the first medium-wave broadcasting in Iceland commenced in East Iceland at Eiðar. In 1966, the transmitter was converted to longwave, at a power of 20kW. In 1998 the mast was reconstructed at a height of 220m and its power increased to 100kW, at 207kHz.

Since 1999, longwave broadcasts were a mix of Rás 1 and Rás 2 content. The longwave transmissions were intended to fill gaps in the FM coverage, serve the Icelandic fishing fleet and serve as an back up during emergencies. 

RÚV began the retirement of its longwave transmissions in 2023, citing its inadequacy as a backup service as most vehicles and radios do not support longwave broadcasts anymore. In 2023, the Eiðar longwave transmitter was demolished, ceasing 207kHz transmissions. The Hellissandur transmitter would later end broadcasts in October 2024, marking the end of longwave broadcasts in Iceland although the mast remained in place.

==== Shortwave and medium-wave broadcasting ====
Shortwave broadcasts were used for long distance transmission, mostly for seafarers and Icelanders abroad. They were used intermittently for important broadcasts. Shortwave broadcasts ceased on 1 July 2007, after the introduction of satellite broadcasts. Smaller medium-wave repeaters were previously operated for areas which were poorly served by the longwave service.

==== FM broadcasting ====
FM broadcasting began in 1959 at its main Vatnsendi site, later expanding nationwide. Stereo transmissions began in 1980. In 1983 RÚV&#x27;s second radio station was launched, Rás 2. The original station was then renamed Rás 1. In 2023, as a result of LW transmissions retiring, RÚV committed to expanding the FM network further. 

In 2004, RÚV launched a non-talk, automated classical and jazz radio station called Rondó, based on the word rondo. In 2020, Rondó was discontinued on FM (due to the closure of Vatnsendi site) but continued on DVB and on the internet.

=== Television ===

RÚV commenced television transmissions in 1966, and colour transmissions began in 1977. In 1981, the first live satellite programmes were broadcast, from the then-newly inaugurated satellite ground station Skyggnir.

Since 1986, the year in which its monopoly as the only permitted domestic broadcaster ended, RÚV has faced competition from a number of private broadcasting companies, most notably the 365 corporation.

RÚV&#x27;s teletext service, &quot;Textavarpið&quot;, was inaugurated on the 25th anniversary of Icelandic television in 1991. As of 2023 it is still operating.

In May 2007, RÚV began direct satellite TV broadcasts over DVB-S from Intelsat 10-02 satellite with a frequency of 11182 V 3100 7/8, supplemented by Rás 1 and Rás 2 over DTV radio. This was later moved to the Thor 5 satellite, in order to service fishing fleets around Iceland and remote areas where the terrestrial network does not reach. Telenor ASA ran the service by contract until it ceased by the end of 2024, the service was encrypted and was only available on request. 

High definition digital television broadcasts in 1080i began in 2013, over a DVB-T2 network. Television was broadcast in analogue until the digital switchover in 2015, when the last analogue transmitter at Vatnsendi was switched off. The analogue transmissions used a network of 180 analogue transmitters. 

In 2021, television transmissions for the Reykjavík area were moved from Vatnsendi to Úlfarsfell, ending 70 years of broadcasting from the location.

== Programming ==
RÚV is obliged by the terms of its charter to &quot;promote the Icelandic language, Icelandic history, and Iceland&#x27;s cultural heritage&quot; and &quot;honour basic democratic rules, human rights, and the freedom of speech and opinion&quot;. It carries a substantial amount of arts, media, and current affairs programming, in addition to which it also supplies general entertainment in the form of feature films and such internationally popular television drama series as &quot;Lost&quot; and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. RÚV&#x27;s lineup also includes sports coverage, documentaries, domestically produced entertainment shows, and children&#x27;s programming.

The RÚV newsroom, providing news for both television and radio, is amongst the most time-honoured and respected in Iceland. On weekdays, the Rás 2 radio network includes 35 minutes of regional opt-outs for local news coverage.

&quot;Gettu betur&quot; is a popular annual quiz tournament pitting teams from senior secondary schools around Iceland against each other in five rounds which are broadcast on radio and TV. Popular viewing also includes the Eurovision Song Contest, to which RÚV has sent participants on Iceland&#x27;s behalf since 1986. In sports, RÚV traditionally carries live coverage of such major events as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup, although it lost the right to broadcast the 2006 World Cup, having been outbid by commercial broadcaster 365 in 2002. It did, however, show the 2010 World Cup tournament.

== Services ==
RÚV broadcasts two linear television channels and three radio stations, each with a certain target market. In accordance with its duty as a public broadcasting service, Sjónvarpið, the television network, broadcasts a news bulletin in Icelandic Sign Language for the deaf and hard of hearing. In addition, the Rás 1 radio channel broadcasts detailed weather reports for the benefit of Icelandic seafarers and others. 

=== Television channels ===

* RÚV Television (also known as &quot;Sjónvarpið&quot;) – main channel with generalist programming
* RÚV 2 – part-time &quot;special events&quot; channel
* KrakkaRÚV – an online service aimed at children and young people, launched in 2015

Those who watch television on the internet outside Iceland can only watch selected programs on RÚV and RÚV 2 channels due to broadcasting rights.

=== Radio stations ===

* Rás 1 (Channel 1) – News, weather, current affairs, culture
* Rás 2 (Channel 2) – Pop and rock music
* Rondó – Non-stop classical music and jazz (DVB-T2 and web only)

==Distribution==
As of 2023, most of the population accesses RÚV through the internet. FM radio broadcasts remain popular however, 30% of Icelanders listen to Rás 1 and 61% listen to Rás 2 in a given week. This can be attributed to Iceland&#x27;s high car ownership.

=== Radio ===
RÚV&#x27;s radio stations, Rás 1 and Rás 2, are broadcast on FM through a network of 230 FM transmitters. RÚV intends to strengthen its FM network over the coming years in light of their plan to closing their longwave services in 2024.

The radio stations are also broadcast via terrestrial DTV radio on DVB-T2, as well as through internet radio. There are no plans to implement DAB radio in Iceland.

=== Television ===
The television network, RÚV and RÚV 2, is broadcast terrestrially in 1080i HD on a DVB-T2 network operated by Vodafone Iceland by contract until 2028. The broadcasts are free-to-air and reach 99.9% of the population. According to a 2022 survey, only 1% of the population uses terrestrial broadcasts to watch RÚV.

Due to the prevalence of fiber internet connections in Iceland, the most popular way to view broadcasts is through the internet. RÚV is available through managed IPTV systems on Síminn and Vodafone. RÚV also offers all of its content on their website, as well as through OTT services. RÚV also offers an app for Apple TV, iOS, Android TV and Android. Webcasts are open and free when accessed from Iceland, however some programming is not available internationally due to licencing issues. It is possible to login using an Icelandic digital ID to have full access to broadcasts internationally.

<text>The Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT; Turkish: ) is the national public broadcaster of Turkey, founded in 1964. TRT was for many years the only television and radio broadcaster in Turkey. Before the introduction of commercial radio in 1990, and subsequently commercial television in 1992, it held a monopoly on broadcasting. More recent deregulation of the Turkish television broadcasting market produced analogue cable television. Today, TRT broadcasts around the world, including in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, the United States, and Australia.

Around 70% of TRT&#x27;s funding comes from a license tax on television and radio receivers. Additionally, a 2% TRT tax was added to the electricity bills until January 2022. As these are hypothecated taxes, as opposed to the money allocated to general government funds, the principle is similar to that of the television licence levied in a number of other countries, such as the BBC in the United Kingdom. The rest of TRT&#x27;s funding comes from government grants (around 20%), with the final 10% coming from advertising.

== History ==
TRT&#x27;s predecessor, was one of 23 founding broadcasting organisations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950; it would return to the EBU fold as TRT in 1972. The original company started radio test broadcasts in 1926, with a studio built in Istanbul in 1927 and a studio in Ankara following in 1928.

Test transmissions started on TRT 1 on 31 January 1968. A full national television schedule, which at that time linked the areas in and around Ankara, Istanbul, and İzmir, started in December 1971. TRT renewed its membership in the European Broadcasting Union (having been a founding member previously offering only radio) starting on 26 August 1972, with Turkey&#x27;s first Eurovision Network event, a football match (Turkey vs. Italy), airing across Europe on 13 January 1973. TRT also joined the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union in 1976, the same year their first colour television test was showcased via laboratory at the general assembly of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference.

All programming was in black and white from the start of test transmissions in 1968 until the New Year&#x27;s Eve programming on 31 December 1981, when the first on-air colour tests started. The entire lineup switched to colour on 15 March 1984.

TRT organised the Eurovision Song Contest 2004, with the semi-final on 12 May 2004 and the final on 15 May 2004.

On 19 May 2012, TRT 1 HD started simulcasting with TRT 1 upscaled to full HD 16:9 DVB-S2 standard.

In January 2018, TRT celebrated its 50th anniversary. All TRT channels broadcast a collection of old idents and news studio (still being modern logo) as part of the celebration in form of nostalgia. Each day new idents were made. This event also happened in 1978, 1988, 1998 and 2008.

On 9 May 2023, TRT Diyanet Children&#x27;s channel started its test broadcast.

During the July 2016 coup attempt, TRT offices in Istanbul and Ankara were raided by lieutenant colonel Umit Gencer and other soldiers. TRT news anchor Tijen Karas was forced to read a statement from the plotters live on TV declaring the coup. After the coup attempt, people in TRT were either fired or forced to retire. According to Haber-Sen Union, 1800 workers were forced to retire. The union protested this situation on 21 November 2018 in Istanbul, Ankara, Diyarbakir and Brussels. During the protests, TRT employees stated that they were exposed to psychological pressure defined as MOBING. TRT employee Osman Köse stated that more than 3,000 TRT employees had been transferred to other state institutions and 5,000 people had been dismissed from TRT. Many TRT employees were dismissed and imprisoned on charges related to the coup attempt. According to the list published in the &#x27;Resmi Gazete&#x27; of the state, 312 people were dismissed. According to a report provided by Gülen-linked NGO Stockholm Center for Freedom (SCF), approximately 150 TRT employees were accused of being members of a &#x27;terrorist organisation&#x27;.

== Exportation of TRT programmes ==
TRT, recognized as Turkey&#x27;s state television broadcaster and engaged in public broadcasting, initially captured viewership with imported programs, series, and films from abroad, gradually expanding its screens to include domestic productions and producing its own content. Examining television studies at both international and national levels reveals that the societal, economic, and sociological challenges within countries have consistently been reflected in cinema or television productions throughout different periods.

Turkish TV series, widely popular within Turkey, have now gained international recognition, surpassing expectations and serving as a promotional tool for Turkey, leading the country to become the second-largest exporter of TV series globally as of 2018. Turkey, exporting its TV programmes internationally since 1981, particularly highlighted by the export of the series &quot;Aşk-ı Memnu&quot; first aired on TRT in 1975 to France, has become the second-largest exporter of TV series globally after the United States as of 2019, and in 2022, it is known that around 100 Turkish series were exported to 150 countries, emphasizing the economic significance and communicative role of TV series. Turkish dramas have evolved from domestic productions to globally exported products, competing with local shows and U.S. imports in terms of viewership, and they have also expanded their reach to countries beyond their linguistic regions, including Azerbaijan, other Turkic-speaking nations, and Western Europe, where a significant expatriate Turkish audience resides. Considering all these, it can be noted that “Turkish TV series now reach 400 million viewers worldwide”. Since 2000, Turkish soap operas have consistently grown in production, achieving significant success locally and expanding their influence globally through exports, initially in regions culturally connected to the former Ottoman Empire such as the Balkans and the Middle East, and subsequently reaching as far as Latin America, China, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and more. It should be also stated that &quot;after 2010, the film and television sector received growing support from the Ministry of Customs and Trade to promote exports in the sector&quot;. It is scholarly stated that &quot;over the twelve-year period from 2010 to 2022, information indicates that TRT has undertaken 50 different television projects in the &#x27;family&#x27; genre, constituting approximately 55.55% of the total TV series broadcasting during this period&quot;. Turkish television soap operas blend globalized consumerism and romantic love, transcending national boundaries, yet they also portray traditional family structures and gender roles, setting them apart from the American prototype—a characteristic referred to as the &quot;Turkish touch&quot;. Similarly, TV series, initially exported to the Middle East and Balkan countries, have gradually been sold to various countries, including the United States, turning the present-day TV industry into a massive globalized sector and representing a significant counterflow in the global circulation of cultural products. Besides, &quot;Turkish serials for television have typically been sold to international broadcasters in packages of 100 commercial hours per show. In another noteworthy development, TRT has been offering its original productions free of charge for international viewers, either dubbed or subtitled, on their YouTube platforms&quot;.

When Turkish exports initially gained popularity in the Middle East and Balkans, there was a prevailing belief that the resonance of content and characters with the cultural preferences of the audiences explained their widespread appeal. However, as research indicates that transnational viewers in the Middle East find the stories, traditions, and family relations relatable to their own reality, it is noteworthy that Turkish TV exports have also garnered popularity in diverse regions such as Africa, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Overall, Turkey is implementing a new foreign policy, aimed at expanding connections beyond the Western world, grounded in acknowledging historical, cultural, and political ties with the MENA and Central Asia; and the Turkish government is actively striving to establish Turkey as a global and regional leader.

TRT Persian launched in December 2024 aimed at Iran and international news in Persian for Iranian and international Persian audiences. Zahid Sobacı, director-general of TRT, previously said that TRT Persian would be launched by the end of 2024 and emphasized twice that “we must disturb Iran.”

<doc id="542488" wikidata="Q209727" url="?curid=542488" title="Palmitic acid">
<text>Palmitic acid (hexadecanoic acid in IUPAC nomenclature) is a fatty acid with a 16-carbon chain. It is the most common saturated fatty acid found in animals, plants and microorganisms. Its chemical formula is , and its C:D ratio (the total number of carbon atoms to the number of carbon-carbon double bonds) is 16:0. It is a major component of palm oil from the fruit of &quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot; (oil palms), making up to 44% of total fats. Meats, cheeses, butter, and other dairy products also contain palmitic acid, amounting to 50–60% of total fats.

Palmitates are the salts and esters of palmitic acid. The palmitate anion is the observed form of palmitic acid at physiologic pH (7.4). Major sources of C16:0 are palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and milk fat.

==Occurrence and production==
Palmitic acid was discovered by Edmond Frémy (in 1840) in the saponification of palm oil, which process remains today the primary industrial route for producing the acid. Triglycerides (fats) in palm oil are hydrolysed by high-temperature water and the resulting mixture is fractionally distilled.

===Dietary sources===
Palmitic acid is produced by a wide range of plants and organisms, typically at low levels. Among common foods it is present in milk, butter, cheese, and some meats, as well as cocoa butter, olive oil, soybean oil, and sunflower oil, (see table). Karukas contain 44.90% palmitic acid. The cetyl ester of palmitic acid, cetyl palmitate, occurs in spermaceti.

==Biochemistry==
Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid produced during fatty acid synthesis and is the precursor to longer fatty acids. As a consequence, palmitic acid is a major body component of animals. In humans, one analysis found it to make up 21–30% (molar) of human depot fat, and it is a major, but highly variable, lipid component of human breast milk. Palmitate negatively feeds back on acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which in turn is used to add to the growing acyl chain, thus preventing further palmitate generation.

Some proteins are modified by the addition of a palmitoyl group in a process known as palmitoylation. Palmitoylation is important for localisation of many membrane proteins.

==Applications==
=== Surfactant ===
Palmitic acid is used to produce soaps, cosmetics, and industrial mold release agents. These applications use sodium palmitate, which is commonly obtained by saponification of palm oil. To this end, palm oil, rendered from palm trees (species &quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot;), is treated with sodium hydroxide (in the form of caustic soda or lye), which causes hydrolysis of the ester groups, yielding glycerol and sodium palmitate.

=== Foods ===
Because it is inexpensive and adds texture and &quot;mouthfeel&quot; to processed foods (convenience food), palmitic acid and its sodium salt find wide use in foodstuffs. Sodium palmitate is permitted as a natural additive in organic products.

=== Military ===
Aluminium salts of palmitic acid and naphthenic acid were the gelling agents used with volatile petrochemicals during World War II to produce napalm. The word &quot;napalm&quot; is derived from the words naphthenic acid and palmitic acid.

==Research==
It is well accepted in the medical community that palmitic acid from dietary sources raises low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol. The World Health Organization have stated there is convincing evidence that palmitic acid increases cardiovascular disease risk.

A 2021 review indicated that replacing dietary palmitic acid and other saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fatty acids, such as oleic acid, could reduce several biomarkers of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

<text>Bibliomancy is the use of books in divination. The use of sacred books (especially specific words and verses) for &quot;magical medicine&quot;, for removing negative entities, or for divination is widespread in many religions of the world.

==Terminology==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;bibliomancy&quot; (etymologically from and ) &quot;divination by books, or by verses of the Bible&quot; was first recorded in 1753 (&quot;Chambers&#x27; Cyclopædia&quot;). Sometimes this term is used synonymously with &quot;stichomancy&quot; (from ) &quot;divination by lines of verse in books taken at hazard&quot;, which was first recorded (Urquhart&#x27;s &quot;Rabelais&quot;).

&quot;Bibliomancy&quot; compares with &quot;rhapsodomancy&quot; (from ) &quot;divination by reading a random passage from a poem&quot;. A historical precedent was the ancient Roman practice of sortes (&#x27;sortilege, divination by drawing lots&#x27;) which specialized into &quot;sortes Homericae&quot;, &quot;sortes Virgilianae&quot;, and &quot;sortes Sanctorum&quot;, using the texts of Homer, Virgil, and the Bible.

==Method==

The diviner selects a book that is believed to hold truth. They open it at a random page, and place their finger in a random place on that page. They then read the one or two sentences that they find themselves pointing to.

Among Christians, the Bible is most commonly used (in the &quot;Sortes Sanctorum&quot;), and in Islamic cultures the Quran. In the Middle Ages the use of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; was common in Europe and known as the &quot;sortes Virgilianae&quot;. In the classical world the &quot;sortes Virgilianae&quot; and &quot;sortes Homericae&quot; (using the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;) were used.

In Iran, bibliomancy using &quot;The Divān of Hafez&quot; is the most popular for this kind of divination, but by no means the only kind. The Quran, as well as the Mathnawī of Rumi may also be used. Fāl-e Ḥafez may be used for one or more persons.

There is a prevalent practice among certain, particularly messianic, members of Chabad-Lubavitch Chasidic movement to use the Igrot Kodesh, a thirty-volume collection of letters written by their leader Menachem Mendel Schneerson for guidance.

Another variant requires the selection of a random book from a library before selecting the random passage from that book. This also holds if a book has fallen down from a shelf on its own. English poet Robert Browning used this method to ask about the fate of his attraction to Elizabeth Barrett (later known as Elizabeth Barrett Browning). He was at first disappointed to choose the book &quot;Cerutti&#x27;s Italian Grammar&quot;, but on randomly opening it his eyes fell on the following sentence: &quot;if we love in the other world as we do in this, I shall love thee to eternity&quot; (which was a translation exercise).

== In Islam ==

Bibliomancy has a long history in Islamic culture, using both secular and religious books, especially the Quran. The Persian word Falnama or Falnamah (&quot;Book of omens&quot; or &quot;Book of divinations&quot;) covers two forms of bibliomancy used historically in Iran, Turkey, and India. Quranic Falnamas were sections at the end of Quran manuscripts used for fortune-telling based on a grid. It was common for Quran manuscripts produced in India and Iran to have folios at the end specifically for divination, from at least the late 14th century to the 19th. In the 16th century, Falnama manuscripts were introduced that used a different system; individuals performed purification rituals, opened a random page in the book and interpreted their fortune in light of the painting and its accompanying text. Only a few illustrated Falnamas now survive; these were commissioned by rich patrons and are unusually large books for the time, with bold, finely executed paintings.

Falnama manuscripts were unusually large books; the surviving examples range from to more than high. The paintings combined secular and religious imagery and their depiction of religious and mythical figures was very influential on other works. Each painting told the story of an event, although there was no narrative for the book as a whole; the order of paintings was random. They were consulted to divine the prospects for a major decision (such as a business venture, marriage, or house move) or to divine the condition of absent relatives or friends. To answer a question, readers would perform ablutions, recite prayers from the Quran and then open the book at a random page. The text explained whether the prediction was favourable, unfavourable, or middling. For example, a painting of the Sun would suggest a favourable outcome while a villain usually meant a disastrous outcome. To avoid the worst outcomes, the text recommended pious acts such as prayer, pilgrimage, or kindness to others.

==In fiction==

*In &quot;Michael Strogoff&quot; (1876) by Jules Verne, Feofar Khan judged Michael Strogoff to blindness after pointing randomly in the Koran at the phrase: &quot;And he will no more see the things of this earth.&quot;
*In &quot;The Book of Webster&#x27;s&quot; (1993) by J. N. Williamson, the sociopathic protagonist Dell uses the dictionary to guide his actions.
*In the short story &quot;The Ash-tree&quot; by M. R. James, bibliomancy is used to produce a warning message from the Bible.
*The novel &quot;The First Verse&quot; by Barry McCrea tells the story of Niall Lenihan, a student who falls in with a &#x27;cult&#x27; whose members use &quot;sortes&quot; to guide them.
*In Wilkie Collins&#x27; 1868 novel &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, the narrator Gabriel Betteredge routinely practices bibliomancy using the pages of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. This is a good example of intertextuality, since Crusoe himself uses bibliomancy in his journey toward redemption. 
*In &quot;Lirael&quot;, by Garth Nix, &quot;The Black Book of Bibliomancy&quot;, a fake book, is mentioned.
*In Augusten Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Running with Scissors&quot;, bibliomancy (referred to as &quot;Bible-dipping&quot;) is used by one of the main characters.
* The narrator of Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot;Travels With My Aunt&quot; recounts that his late father used to practice bibliomancy with the writings of Walter Scott: &quot;Once, when he was suffering severely from Constipation, he opened &quot;Rob Roy&quot; at random and read out &quot;Mr Owen entered. So regular were the motions and habits of this worthy man&quot;. (&quot; Travels With My Aunt&quot;, Ch.16.)

<text>Zits is a comic strip written by cartoonist Jerry Scott and illustrated by Jim Borgman about the life of Jeremy Duncan, a 17-year-old high school junior (he was 15 when the comic started). The comic debuted in July 7, 1997 in over 200 newspapers, and by 1998 it was included in &quot;more than 1,700 newspapers worldwide in 45 countries and is translated into 15 different languages.&quot; &quot;Zits&quot; has received multiple awards and continues to be syndicated by King Features.

Set in central Ohio suburbia, the strip centers on Jeremy as he tries to balance his family life, social life, the academic demands of high school and his plans for the future, often with a heavy dose of surrealism, making it stand out from being just a typical teenager cartoon strip.

==Origin==
In 1996, Jerry Scott was drawing &quot;Baby Blues&quot;, a comic strip about raising children he co-wrote with Rick Kirkman. He realized, however, that his profession as an independent cartoonist was limited to whatever joke he could conceive next. A friend suggested he begin a strip about a teenager. Scott heeded the proposition but was unsatisfied with his character&#x27;s sketches, finding them similar to those of his existing strip. After Scott discussed the issue with his artist friend Jim Borgman, the two corresponded with one another over the next few months and eventually collaborated on the characters that would become the Duncans. King Features, already distributing &quot;Baby Blues&quot; and Borgman&#x27;s editorial cartoons, began running the new comic strip in 1997 with Scott writing and Borgman drawing.

Charles Schulz liked the new strip, but added, &quot;&quot;Zits&quot; is the worst name for a comic strip since &quot;Peanuts&quot;.&quot; Said quote would later be printed on the back of the compilation book &quot;Humongous Zits&quot;, along with a ripped-out piece of paper with multiple different names considered (such as &quot;Jeremy&quot;, &quot;Yo.&quot;, and &quot;My So-Called Life and Stuff&quot;), with &quot;Zits&quot; circled last as the final choice.

To create each installment, Jerry Scott comes up with an idea and then writes and sketches a fully scripted layout, which Jim Borgman draws finished art for, occasionally embellishing or replacing Scott&#x27;s layouts if he feels he can make the strip&#x27;s visual more lively.

==Main characters==

===Jeremy Duncan===
Jeremy Michael Duncan is an intelligent, 17-year-old high school junior (earlier a 15-year-old freshman) who aspires to be a rock musician. He is named after Jeremy Clyde of the 1960s rock duo Chad and Jeremy (although one strip shows his parents named him after a lyric in &quot;Joy to the World&quot; by Three Dog Night, &quot;Jeremiah was a bullfrog&quot;) and was once mentioned to have an older brother named Chad, who is away in college. Jeremy spends much of his time with his friends and trying to impress love interest and part-time girlfriend, Sara Toomey. Jeremy was once told by his mother he was conceived to the Led Zeppelin song &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. When not at school or with his friends, Jeremy is often embarrassed and/or lectured by his parents, Walt and Connie Duncan.

He is shown as having an ability to tell who is calling on the telephone and for what reason when it rings (sometimes even before it rings).

He usually wears his purple shirt over a black T-shirt, blue jeans, and fat tongued Sneakers. He is extremely tall, even when slouching. Jeremy spent time restoring a 1962 Volkswagen Type 2 van with his best friend Hector Garcia, which they hoped to drive across the country when they turned 16. The van was in running condition but did not run very well considering its age. In the spring of 2023, the van was flattened by a speeding garbage truck. Jeremy barely fits in the replacement car his half of the insurance money bought him. Jeremy is also the lead singer and guitarist of his garage band, which goes by many names including &quot;Chickenfist&quot;, &quot;Goat Cheese Pizza&quot;, &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Hat&quot;, and &quot;Angry Dwarfs&quot;. In May 2017, his band received their first business engagement, a 6-year-old&#x27;s birthday party. In July 2017 the band had their first &quot;adult&quot; engagement at the Arthur C. Coachella Senior Citizen Center, where the geriatric audience gave them a much better reception, with them constantly shouting &quot;Turn It Up!&quot;. After the band debuted in a Battle of the Bands competition, Jeremy received his first kiss from Sara and the relationship took off. Since then, Jeremy and Sara have gone through many arguments, breakups and reconciliations. For all of Jeremy&#x27;s flaws, however, he retains a high sense of morality and integrity as can be seen in the story arc where he steals a signpost with his name on it, only to return it to the police to free himself of the guilt he feels (although he uses Hector&#x27;s name when turning it over). On another occasion, Jeremy is overwhelmed by a school essay he has to write and all the other commitments he has made. A fellow student, Phoebe, suggests he use a website to pull a bootleg essay off the Internet. In the end, however, Jeremy&#x27;s sense of ethics overcomes the desire to plagiarize, and he spends the night writing the essay himself. In late 2000s strips, Jeremy received his learners&#x27; permit. In September 2007 strips, Jeremy&#x27;s mother refers to his being a sophomore in high school. As of 2009 strips, Jeremy is claimed to be 16. On the August 23, 2009 strip, his driver&#x27;s license was shown.

Running gags in the strip include depictions of Jeremy&#x27;s room as being so messy that Connie has to dig a tunnel to reach him, his tallness and growth spurts, and his ability to consume vast quantities of food in seconds (either by literally inhaling or shoveling it in; one strip even showed him unhinging his jaw to eat a large sandwich).

===Connie Duncan===
Connie Duncan is Jeremy&#x27;s mother, born about 1955. She is a child psychologist, but works only part-time after Jeremy&#x27;s birth, and her profession is rarely mentioned except in early strips. On January 20, 2025, Connie found out she got a job as counselor at Jeremy&#x27;s school. She is also an aspiring writer, having begun work on a book titled: &quot;Coping Effectively with Your Teen&quot;. Jeremy constantly interrupts her work with menial requests or by being too loud and she has yet to even finish the first chapter. Besides being the family homemaker, Connie acts the disciplinarian for Jeremy. She is frequently seen waking him up for school, berating him for not following directions, and driving him to various destinations. Though Jeremy does not share much with his parents, Connie is always more than willing to listen to him. She describes a conversation with him as &quot;coaxing a smile out of a clam full of Botox&quot;. In the strip, she is portrayed a few times as a forgetful .

While Connie means well for Jeremy, she has the tendency to be over-controlling. She consistently reads personal items in Jeremy&#x27;s room, gets upset when Jeremy makes any hint of wanting more privacy, and wants to do everything for him (except homework, which neither of his parents can do).

===Walter &quot;Walt&quot; Duncan===
Walt Duncan is Jeremy&#x27;s father, an orthodontist who, like Connie, finds it almost impossible to hold a conversation with his son. Walt is portrayed as clueless and old-fashioned about technology, especially computers and video players. Despite Jeremy&#x27;s attempts to explain how to use devices, Walt is unable to comprehend even the most basic functions. Walt is shown as having problems with math, as all he knows is the Pythagorean theorem. He has been shown to think that a fan belt is part of a search engine and that &quot;Googling&quot; somebody means having sexual intercourse with them. His interactions with Jeremy&#x27;s peers cause intense embarrassment for his son, as Walt makes comments such as &quot;What&#x27;s up, dood?&quot;, not knowing the meaning behind them. He is the designated clothes launderer, often getting into arguments with Jeremy over notes in pockets, socks inside-out, and other pet peeves. Overweight and balding, Walt wears oversized blue pants, a plain white T-shirt, black vest, and combover (Jeremy has commented that this makes him look like a Wal-Mart greeter). Walt occasionally reveals memories that attest to a wilder youth, but most of these anecdotes are nonsense. According to Connie, his army jacket which &quot;holds &quot;awful&quot; memories&quot; was picked up by Walt at a thrift shop on a day when &quot;the traffic was terrible&quot;, left Woodstock to paint his aunt&#x27;s house when it began to rain, and when dating Connie, he once gave her a bong, mistaking it for a flower pot. In one instance, Walt recalls how uninhibited he felt one night at a Moby Grape concert. This shocking recollection causes him to forbid Jeremy from attending a similar concert. Another time, Walt reveals he has had a peace sign tattoo since the late 1960s, which has expanded along with his rear end, and is described to now be the size of a stop sign.

However, at times, he has been as cool as he can be to his son, like when he got a guitar pick from one of Jeremy&#x27;s favorite bands who turned out also to be orthodontists.

===Hector Garcia===
Hector Garcia is Jeremy&#x27;s best friend and is a guitarist/vocalist in Jeremy&#x27;s band. The two spend a lot of their time hanging out, much of it trying to restore the VW van and dreaming about where their future road trip will take them. In practice, the two have not gotten far toward restoring the van past making it run, as the boys usually end up lying on the roof of the van, talking. Hector used to date Autumn, a militant vegetarian who refers to Jeremy as &quot;carnivore&quot;, &quot;predator&quot;, &quot;vampire&quot;, and &quot;flesh-eater&quot; or the like whenever she sees him with meat. He has the ability to grow facial hair on command. Hector is from a Spanish-speaking family and lives with his parents, grandparents, and multiple younger siblings and is apparently Roman Catholic. Around the same time Jeremy learned he was conceived to &quot;Stairway to Heaven,&quot; Hector revealed he learned that when his parents conceived him, blueberry muffins were burning in the oven.

Over the course of a story arc in 2011, Hector received a complete makeover from the Posse. The makeover has stuck since, ultimately giving him a new character design.

===Sara Toomey===
Sara Toomey is Jeremy&#x27;s on-again/off-again girlfriend. Although Jeremy thinks the world of her, she apparently likes Jeremy a lot, but has thought of him as a &quot;salvageable male&quot;. Her parents are divorced and her behavior wavers between kindness and aggravation. She and Jeremy have broken up many times, but they always seem to make up sooner or later. Sara&#x27;s genuine kindness and generosity is evident in one story arc where she cuts her hair short and donates her ponytail to a charity for children undergoing chemotherapy. In the January 15, 2008, strip, Jeremy revealed he did not want to date Sara exclusively anymore, but was upset when she readily accepted this change. Sara has a locker next to Jeremy in their second year.

===Pierce===
Pierce is another of Jeremy&#x27;s close friends, and the drummer of Jeremy&#x27;s band (after the old drummer, Y.A., quit the band) who, as his name implies, has much of his body pierced; in a 2008 storyline, Jeremy learned that when not in the presence of his friends, Pierce finds himself compelled to remove his piercings and dress like a preppy. Unlike most of Jeremy&#x27;s close friends, Pierce&#x27;s last name has not been revealed. He explains this early on, before realizing he has to get braces:

:Pierce: &quot;I have a stud in my tongue, posts in my lips, rings in my nose and eyebrows, and twelve earrings on each ear. I defy anyone to find a way to attach more metal to my head.&quot;
:Walt: &quot;Pierce, you need braces.&quot;

Pierce is worried by this until Walt says, &quot;Don&#x27;t think of it as getting braces... think of it as getting your smile pierced.&quot; which makes Pierce so happy, he hugs him. After he gets his braces he shows them off for a while and describes them to Jeremy like they were a work of art. In 2016, he had them removed. Additionally, he has Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Chapel mural tattooed on the roof of his mouth.

Despite his rebellious appearance, Pierce is actually very courteous and often tries to help out, but usually fails due to his interests and ideals. He is also very caring towards his pets and toward others, which he fulfills by donating to charities. Once, when Jeremy asked him to purchase a necklace for Sara for him, Pierce bought a necklace with a pair of jeweled skulls with intertwined snakes in the eye sockets, framed by a barbed-wire heart. He has also been described as a very polite and cautious driver by Sara&#x27;s mom. He began dating D&#x27;ijon after she went to see him get another stud in his tongue. Like Hector&#x27;s girlfriend, Autumn, Pierce is an animal activist and environmentalist and has been known to wear tofu shoes because leather uses cow hides, rubber uses oil, and wood uses trees. A running gag in the comic features Pierce pulling the fire alarm at school. Pierce is quite naïve - in one instance his uncle &quot;sold&quot; Pierce T-shirts for the band with the &quot;Goat Cheese Pizza&quot; Logo for $100.00, when the going rate was $2.00.

==Supporting characters==

===Clapton===
Clapton is an often-silent brown cat (breed unknown), adopted by the Duncans in a 2020 strip. She seems to have one eye missing, though this has not yet been explained or addressed by the strip or characters. She is shown to have many of Jeremy&#x27;s traits, such as heavy sleeping; in the October 30, 2021 strip, she sleeps soundly on Pierce&#x27;s drums while the latter plays, leading him to remark that Clapton &quot;will be fine&quot; despite the noise of the trick-or-treaters the following night.

===Phoebe===
Phoebe is one of Jeremy&#x27;s classmates and is presented as a hyperbolic overachiever, using any means necessary to excel academically and enter a &quot;high-power college&quot;. She also consumes massive amounts of caffeine and has an espresso machine in her locker, which annoys almost everyone. She is constantly padding her college resume. Sadly, Phoebe is so obsessed with success that she has no sense of right and wrong, and will do nearly anything dishonest to get ahead, such as downloading bootleg reports off the Internet. (Jeremy did not take her suggestion to do so, and she got caught.) She has no pupils in her eyes, which she claims is due to selling her soul for a 4.3 GPA.

===D&#x27;ijon===
D&#x27;ijon is an African-American student at Jeremy&#x27;s high school. She is Pierce&#x27;s girlfriend and one of Sara&#x27;s friends. She has dreadlocks, a copy of Edvard Munch&#x27;s &quot;The Scream&quot; tattooed on her tongue and occasionally wanders around with Pierce after connecting their respective earrings. Her real name is Dionne; apparently, she started doing the &quot;apostrophe thing&quot; in 7th grade.

===Autumn===
Autumn is Hector&#x27;s ex-girlfriend and a strict vegetarian, whose social graces are as lacking as her personal hygiene (she appears to have more hair under her arms than on her head). She is noted for her extreme liberal and environmentalist political actions such as freeing 50,000 live crickets in the school to spare them from dissection (this only led to them being killed by the school being sprayed by an exterminator.) Autumn despises Jeremy and has called him &quot;flesh eater&quot;, &quot;vampire&quot;, &quot;murderer&quot; and &quot;cannibal&quot; for eating meat.

===Brittany===
Brittany is another of Jeremy&#x27;s classmates and is the information pipeline for the sophomore class. She has the &quot;great gift&quot; of being able to critique the shortcomings of others. Despite her negativity, Jeremy has several times sought her advice. In one story arc, while she is advising Jeremy about a Christmas present for Sara, she says she is lucky to be Jewish.

===Timothy &quot;Tim&quot; Olsen===
Tim Olsen is a shy, moody classmate of Jeremy&#x27;s and the bassist of the band. His mother had breast cancer, and thinking the chemotherapy would make her hair fall out (thus Tim&#x27;s shaved head), Jeremy and Hector shaved their heads as a token of empathy and comfort. It was not until afterward that they discovered she still had all her hair.

===The Posse===
The Posse is a trio of vapid girls: Zuma, Redondo and LaJolla. The three have reportedly been &quot;best friends forever&quot; and &quot;share the same taste in fashion... finishing each other&#x27;s sentences.&quot; All three girls are named after beaches in California. Zuma is portrayed in one comic as one very obsessed with her makeup and clothes, even going so far as to change her Social Security number so it is &quot;cuter&quot;; this extends to all of the girls to an extent, however, as they were once &quot;held hostage by their hair&quot; when they were supposed to have been helping Jeremy with a biology lab project. The Posse has the ability to outsource their emotions to each other.

===Richandamy===
&quot;Richandamy&quot;, as their classmates have nicknamed them, are boyfriend and girlfriend Rich and Amy who are generally seen in a constant, intertwined hug. One is rarely seen without the other, except for bathroom situations. They hug so hard that they can feel each other&#x27;s pores and even undergo cellular mitosis. Their embrace is fodder for much disgust and ridicule among their classmates, triggering many cynical comments. They broke up briefly in November 2006, and Rich was shown to have his arms locked in a &quot;permahug&quot; even without Amy in them. Richandamy were based on a couple who Jim Borgman knew in college.

==Guest appearances==

===Chad Duncan===
Chad Duncan is Jeremy&#x27;s older brother by four years. He attends college and is an overachiever and the object of much jealousy by Jeremy. In his first few appearances, Chad was said to be the perfect child, having his face slightly obscured, and having a more muscular build. He was later re-drawn as looking like an older version of Jeremy with a goatee. Chad is an occasional character and rarely appears, typically showing up during the holiday seasons and leaving abruptly. In one strip, he told Jeremy he had been there for two weeks already. After Jeremy said he needed to pay more attention, Chad replied, &quot;That&#x27;s what I keep telling your sister.&quot; Chad is a business major, &quot;with a minor in uncommunication&quot;, according to Walt, as he almost never calls home.

===Viral===
Viral is another of Jeremy&#x27;s classmates and friends. Viral is an over-achiever, tending to do many things at once (being class president, captain of the JV volleyball team, as well as many other activities) or better than normally expected. It has been revealed that Jeremy has a slight crush on her, although he is still faithful to Sara. Viral is a bit like Phoebe (for example, Viral also has a GPA above 4.0) but much more principled, and outgoing, and is energetic without a caffeine addiction. Viral also has been perceived as a perfectionist, as well as attentive. Viral first appeared in the comic strip on November 7, 2007.
It is possible that Viral may have been Jeremy&#x27;s girlfriend for a time (or someone introduced for a future love triangle with Sara; indeed, her name is an anagram for &#x27;RIVAL&#x27;)—during the story arc where Jeremy is caught driving past Viral&#x27;s house 63 times (of which Pierce is so proud that he breaks down crying), the Judge references Viral as Jeremy&#x27;s girlfriend, and Jeremy does not deny it. She began to appear less in the months after this story arc, and since then, seems to have been dropped from the strip.

===Becker===
Becker, or Rebecca, is a fast-paced girl who is Jeremy&#x27;s love interest beginning in 2008 strips. They first meet in the coffee shop, where she added her phone number to Jeremy&#x27;s cell phone and talked to him (never letting Jeremy get in a word edgewise) followed by a kiss that makes Jeremy infatuated with her. However, Becker has not appeared in the strip since this story arc, save for a brief mention in the September 7, 2008 strip.

===Albert Tang===
Albert Tang is another classmate of Jeremy&#x27;s, first appearing in a strip that was centered around Jeremy&#x27;s birthday. They had both been in class when the teacher mentioned someone&#x27;s birthday was coming soon. Jeremy dreads that the teacher will mention his. When the teacher goes on to tell the class about Albert&#x27;s instead, Jeremy exclaims &quot;Hey, what about me?!&quot; He returned to the strip in December 2008, asking Sara to the high school&#x27;s winter formal. He used a rose and love note while Jeremy dressed up in a gorilla suit. Sara picked Albert. He was also mentioned in December 2010 when Pierce decoded a mumbled message from Jeremy about him studying the wrong chapter for a test. Jeremy was both sorry and amused at this.

===Billy===
Billy is one of Jeremy&#x27;s classmates; they are distant friends. Billy is openly gay, although this is only mentioned in a small number of strips. Billy once participated in a poker game with Jeremy and a few of their other peers from school.

===Guidance counselor===
The guidance counselor at Jeremy&#x27;s high school is a blond woman whose words and advice to Jeremy are often not heard because Jeremy&#x27;s mind is lost in erotic fantasies about her, whenever he is in her presence.

==Recognition and future developments==
&quot;Zits&quot; runs in over 1,500 newspapers worldwide. Writer Jerry Scott received the National Cartoonists Society (NCS) Reuben Award in 2001. The strip itself has been translated into at least ten languages, including German, Chinese, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish and Estonian.&quot; Additionally, both Scott and Jim Borgman received the NCS Award for Best Newspaper Comic Strip two years running, as well as the Max &amp; Moritz Medal for Best International Comic. As of 2009, the creators portray Jeremy as a 16-year-old, and say this will probably not change. Borgman comments that the strip is inexorably built around the humorous tension of Jeremy living under his parents&#x27; rules and that, without this tension, the strip would cease to be humorous. There is some disagreement among them, however, as to how deep the characters should develop. Borgman would like the series to tackle complicated issues such as AIDS, drugs, and premarital sex, while Scott prefers not to &quot;see the 6 o&#x27;clock news...on the funny pages.&quot;
==Books==
&quot;Zits&quot; comic strips are collected in two formats. The first is as a &quot;Zits Sketchbook&quot; and these are numbered sequentially. They contain approximately one year of collected &quot;Zits&quot; strips. The second format is as a &quot;Zits Treasury&quot;. This format combines the material from the two previous &quot;sketchbooks&quot;. After sketchbook #15 was published in 2012, this format was dropped, and since then only treasuries have been published. In 2013, Scott and Borgman created an illustrated novel entitled &quot;Zits: Chillax&quot; based on their comic strip.

<doc id="542507" wikidata="Q174654" url="?curid=542507" title="The Secret of Chimneys">
<text>The Secret of Chimneys is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by The Bodley Head in June 1925 and in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company later in the same year. It introduces the characters of Superintendent Battle and Lady Eileen &quot;Bundle&quot; Brent. The UK edition retailed at seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) and the US edition at $2.00.

At the request of George Lomax, Lord Caterham reluctantly agrees to host a weekend party at his home, Chimneys. A murder occurs in the house, beginning a week of fast-paced events with police among the guests.

The novel was well received at first publication, described as more than a murder mystery, as it is a treasure hunt. Later reviews found it a first-class romp and one of the author&#x27;s best early thrillers. The most recent review says the novel requires a hefty suspension of disbelief.

==Plot summary==
When they meet up in Bulawayo, Anthony Cade agrees to take on two jobs for his friend James McGrath. Anthony heads for London to deliver the draft of a memoir to a publisher, who has pledged to pay £1000 if it is delivered by a certain date; and to return a packet of compromising letters to the woman who wrote them. In England, politician George Lomax persuades Lord Caterham to host a house party at Chimneys. George&#x27;s cousin Virginia Revel is invited, as is Hiram Fish, a collector of first edition books, along with the principals in a political scheme to restore the monarchy in Herzoslovakia – while assuring that newly discovered oil there will be handled by a British syndicate.

On Cade&#x27;s first day in London, he is approached by two Herzoslovakian men who try to acquire the manuscript. The first, a Count supporting the Royalist faction, tries to buy the manuscript, offering to outbid the publisher, to suppress any embarrassing information it might contain; Cade politely but firmly refuses. The second, a member of a violent revolutionary group, demands Cade hand it over at gunpoint; Cade disarms the man and sends him away. Later that night, Cade discovers his waiter sneaking into his hotel room; the waiter escapes with the packet of letters. The publisher calls Cade the next day, telling him that their employee Mr Holmes will arrive to pick up the memoir. This was written by the late Count Stylptitch of Herzoslovakia; now that oil has been discovered, the nation is in turmoil between republicans and royalists. On advice, Cade puts a dummy package in the hotel safe.

The thief brings one letter to Virginia Revel at her home, as it is her name signed to each letter. Unaware she did not write the letters, and that her husband is dead, he attempts to blackmail her. On a whim, she pays some money, and promises more the next day. When she arrives home the next day, she finds him shot dead in her house, and Anthony Cade on her door step. Cade removes the body, dumping it along a road in the country and hiding the gun up a tree, to avoid a scandal and allow Virginia to proceed to Chimneys.

At Chimneys, Prince Michael, presumed heir to the vacant throne of Herzoslovakia, is killed the night of his arrival. Cade was at Chimneys that same evening, leaving footprints outdoors but not indoors. He boldly introduces himself to Superintendent Battle, explaining the story of the memoirs, and persuading Battle of his innocence in the murder. After seeing that the dead prince is the same man as &quot;Mr Holmes&quot;, Cade pursues his own ideas in finding the murderer, while Battle leads the main investigation. The next heir to the throne, Nicholas, cousin to Michael, was raising money on his expectations in America. Cade checks out the governess, a recent addition to the household; he travels to France to speak with her prior employer.

The Koh-i-Noor diamond had been stolen from the Tower of London and replaced by a paste copy some years earlier, by a French jewel thief named King Victor. Chimneys is one place where it may be hidden, though many searches have not found it. King Victor was released from prison in France a few months earlier, so Battle expects he will seek to recover it. The night Cade is in France, there is a break-in at Chimneys. Virginia Revel hears the noise, and sees one or two men taking old armour apart. She and Bill Eversleigh do not catch the thief. The next night, the three wait for a second attempt; they catch M. Lemoine of the Sûreté, on the track of King Victor. Battle has been waiting for him. The stolen letters reappear in Cade&#x27;s room. It is revealed the letters were coded messages written to King Victor by an accomplice. Battle realizes the thieves want him to decode the letter that points to the location of the stolen gem. This is done, revealing the clue: &quot;Richmond seven straight eight left three right&quot;. Battle follows the Richmond clue to a brick in a hidden passage, which in turn reveals a puzzling . Cade slips out to Dover, to find an address on a slip of paper given him by Boris Anchoukoff, valet to the late prince. He finds the meeting of King Victor&#x27;s gang; Hiram Fish, really a Pinkerton detective on the thief&#x27;s trail for his crimes in America; and the real M Lemoine tied up as a hostage.

At Chimneys, all are gathered to hear the mysteries explained. In the library, Boris finds Miss Brun with a pistol, attempting to get the jewel. They struggle; the gun goes off in her hand, killing her. Miss Brun had killed Prince Michael, because he had recognized her as someone else. She was the last queen consort of Herzoslovakia, thought to have been murdered with her husband in the revolution; but she escaped. She wrote the coded letters to Captain O&#x27;Neill, an alias of King Victor, and signed them with the name of Virginia Revel, who had been living in Herzoslovakia with her husband, a British diplomat. Cade introduces the real M Lemoine to the group, while Hiram Fish snares King Victor, who has been posing as the French detective and in America as Nicholas. Anthony Cade gave &quot;Mr Holmes&quot; the dummy package; he gives the real memoirs to Jimmy McGrath to earn his £1000. Cade and Fish solve the conundrum; it points to a rose bush on the grounds, where the Koh-i-Noor is subsequently recovered. Anthony presents himself as the missing Prince Nicholas, ready to ally with the British syndicate. He offers himself as Herzoslovakia&#x27;s next king. Earlier that day, he married Virginia, who will be his queen.

==Literary significance and reception==
&quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; reviewed the novel in its issue of 9 July 1925 and, after setting up the story, stated favourably that &quot;there is ... a thick fog of mystery, cross-purposes and romance, which leads up to a most unexpected and highly satisfactory ending&quot;.

The reviewer for &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote on 28 June 1925: &quot;Mrs Christie plunges lightheartedly into a real welter of murders, innocently-implicated lookers-on, Balkan politics (of the lighter Ruritanian kind), impersonators, secret societies, ciphers, experts, secret hiding-places, detectives (real and pretended), and emerges triumphantly at the end, before her readers are too hopelessly befogged. Nobody is killed who matters much. The right people marry, after it all, having first endeared themselves to us by their frivolous attitude to the singularly animated doings around them.&quot; The reviewer concluded that Christie&#x27;s &quot;ingenuity and clear-headedness are really remarkable.&quot;

The review in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; of 16 July 1925 began, &quot;Despite Herzoslovakian politics and a background of oil and finance, this new novel by Agatha Christie gets a grip of the reader when it comes down to the business of disposing of a corpse, innocently come by but not to be repudiated without danger of grave scandal&quot; and went on to say, &quot;It is an exciting story with a bewildering array of potential murderers and a curious collection of detectives, amateur and professional, and with a crook of international importance and (alleged) consummate ability.&quot; The review concluded: &quot;There is more than murder in this story; there is a treasure hunt in it, not for gold but a diamond, and the story is suitably staged for the main part at Chimneys, that historic mansion whose secret will be found in Chapter XXIX, though the wise in these matters may have discovered it a little earlier&quot;.

Robert Barnard said it is important to remember when this novel was written &quot;If you can take all of the racialist remarks, which are very much of their time, this is a first-class romp, all the better for not being of the &#x27;plot to take over the world&#x27; variety. It concerns the throne and crown jewels of Herzoslovakia, and combines such Hope-ful [&quot;sic&quot;] elements with bright young things and some effective caricatures.&quot; His final decision on the novel overall was that it was &quot;By far the least awful of the early thrillers.&quot;

Charles Osborne: &quot;The Secret of Chimneys is one of the best of Agatha Christie&#x27;s early thrillers (...). Her attitude to democracy is so unsympathetic, at least as expressed by a character of whom Mrs Christie evidently approves, that it reveals an unexpectedly authoritarian aspect of the author&#x27;s nature&quot;.

In his analysis of Christie&#x27;s Notebooks published in 2010 and 2012, Christie expert and archivist John Curran wrote that &quot;a hefty suspension of disbelief is called for if some aspects of the plot are to be accepted.&quot; Curran considered the novel an &quot;enjoyable but preposterous romp ... littered with loose ends, unlikely motivations and unconvincing characters&quot; and regarded Christie&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Brown Suit&quot; and &quot;The Seven Dials Mystery&quot; &quot;if not more credible, at least far less incredible&quot; than &quot;Chimneys&quot;.

==References and allusions==

===References to actual places===
The Blitz Hotel is in part a reference to London&#x27;s Ritz Hotel, though the location of the Blitz matches that of the Savoy Hotel, where César Ritz had been manager, and which is close to the Embankment. Christie uses the same location (and the same name for it) in the 1924 short stories &quot;Blindman&#x27;s Buff&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Was No. 16&quot;, which later formed part of the 1929 collection &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;.

===References in other works===
The fictional country of Herzoslovakia makes a return appearance in the short story &quot;The Stymphalean Birds&quot; which was first published in the April 1940 issue of the &quot;Strand Magazine&quot; and later appeared in the 1947 collection &quot;The Labours of Hercules&quot;. It is also briefly mentioned in the 1940 novel &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot;.

Christie later used the &quot;Chimneys&quot; mansion, along with the characters of Bill Eversleigh, Bundle, George Lomax, Tredwell, and Lord Caterham from this book, in the 1929 novel &quot;The Seven Dials Mystery&quot;.

===Allusions to real events===
The novel was written in 1925. The characters in the story refer to events that occurred about 7 years earlier, that is, at the end of the Great War when the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires were broken up. The war is never mentioned directly. Instead, in Chapter 19, Superintendent Battle says: &quot;Just over seven years ago, there was a lot what they called reconstruction going on especially in the Near East.&quot; At the same time, many royal persons were in England, including the Queen of Herzoslovakia, and Count Stylptitch; all the Balkan states were interested parties in discussions taking place. It is at this time that the Koh-i-noor diamond disappeared in the plot. Later, in an unspecified year, the Herzoslovakians rose up against the king and his commoner wife. About that time, Mrs Virginia Revel and her husband Tim were part of the diplomatic mission from the UK to Herzoslovakia, so that Mrs Revel had met Prince Michael; she was the only such person at the house party, to know Prince Michael, but not the only person in the house. The time immediately after the war was when the theft, solved in this novel, happened.

This was the last novel published under Christie&#x27;s six-book contract with the Bodley Head which had been agreed back in 1919. Christie had signed without literary agent representation and had come to resent its terms which she stated were unfair. Her future books in the UK were all published by William Collins &amp; Sons (with the sole exception of &quot;The Hound of Death&quot;) once a new and more favourable contract had been signed with them by her newly appointed agent, Edmund Cork of Hughes Massey. Cork became a lifelong friend.

This novel was much admired by her future mother-in-law, Mrs Marguerite Mallowan, who penned a note in a leather-bound copy she commissioned of this book together with &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; and &quot;The Hollow&quot;. The note read &quot;Passing a bookshop while I was in Paris in 1932, I bought &quot;The Secret of Chimneys&quot;, now almost unobtainable. I had just heard of Agatha Christie. Though not a reader of detective stories, her book captivated me so much that I never left it until I had finished it. Soon after she married my son, whom she had met in Mesopotamia while he was working under Sir Leonard Woolley. Later I read &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot; which, I think, made her reputation universal. Lastly came &quot;The Hollow&quot;, a book dear to me as revealing her artistic, simple and sincere temperament. This is the reason for my choice of these three books to be bound together. I wish them to be a testimony of my admiration for her art, and above all, of my gratitude for her loving kindness through all the years I have known her&quot;. The copy of the book was sold at auction in September 2006.

===Book dedication===
In the Bantam edition, the dedication is to &quot;Punkie&quot;, who is Madge, Christie&#x27;s older sister. In other editions the dedication reads:&quot;To my Nephew. In memory of an inscription at Compton Castle and a day at the Zoo.&quot;

The &quot;nephew&quot; was Jack Watts (1903–1961), the son of Christie&#x27;s brother-in-law and sister James and &#x27;Madge&#x27; Watts. Christie became very close to her nephew after his birth when she was thirteen and joined her mother in looking after him at his home, Abney Hall, when her sister and brother-in-law went on skiing holidays to St Moritz and at Christmas. She writes enthusiastically about her memories of this time in the foreword to her 1960 collection of short stories &quot;The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding&quot;. The references to Compton Castle and the zoo are obscure. It is possible that the house &quot;Chimneys&quot; is based on Compton Castle, but Abney Hall is equally probable. Christie gives no description of “Chimneys” in the book, merely stating that &quot;Descriptions of that historic place can be found in any guidebook.”

===Dustjacket blurb===
The dustjacket front flap of the first edition carried no specially written blurb. Instead, both the front and back flap carried advertisements for Christie&#x27;s five other Bodley Head books together with one or two short quotes from reviews of those books.

===International titles===
This novel has been translated to various languages other than its original English. At least seventeen languages are known to have translated versions of this novel, some published as recently as 2014 and 2015. This is in keeping with the author&#x27;s reputation for being the most translated author.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==

===Stage adaptation (1931)===
&quot;The Secret of Chimneys&quot; was adapted by Christie into a stage play in 1931 but its planned performance was cancelled. Nonetheless, a copy was placed in the British Library where it was located and a copy provided to Christie&#x27;s daughter, at whose request its existence was not revealed publicly. Twenty years later, another copy surfaced in Canada, where it received its world premiere on 16 October 2003.

===Television adaptation (2010)===
An adaptation was produced for the fifth series of &quot;Marple&quot;, with Julia McKenzie as the lead. The adaptation retains Chimneys as the setting. However, the substitution of Miss Marple as the main detective is only the first of many changes made to the story, which amalgamates and renames several characters, turns the political connection (transferred from the fictitious Herzoslovakia to Austria) into one of several red herrings, and comprehensively changes both the murderer&#x27;s identity and motive. It also features elements from the Miss Marple short story, &quot;The Herb of Death&quot;.

Its cast includes Edward Fox as Lord Caterham, Anthony Higgins as Count Ludwig, Jonas Armstrong as Anthony Cade, Charlotte Salt as Virginia Revel and Dervla Kirwan as Bundle. Dervla Kirwan, in her late thirties, played Bundle, who, though still the daughter of Lord Caterham, was cast as the sister of 23-year-old Lady Virginia Revel (Charlotte Salt), an unrelated character in the original story. Of the two, Lady Virginia appeared to have more in common with the Bundle of the novels. The &quot;Radio Times&quot; observed that this production was &quot;classic Agatha Christie, even though it&#x27;s only distantly related to her original ... purists will be utterly flummoxed – and the plot has more holes in it than the murder victim&quot;.

===Graphic novel adaptation (2007)===
&quot;The Secret of Chimneys&quot; was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 20 August 2007, adapted by François Rivière and illustrated by Laurence Suhner (). This was translated from the edition first published in France by Emmanuel Proust éditions in 2002 under the title of &quot;Le Secret de Chimneys&quot;.

<text>John Easton Mills (October 14, 1796 – November 12, 1847) served briefly as mayor of Montreal, Quebec.

In March 1846, Montreal city council deadlocked on the choice of a mayor. Mills had ten votes, and incumbent mayor James Ferrier had nine, but Ferrier voted for himself twice, in accordance with existing rules. Municipal paralysis ensued until December 1846, when Mills was elected decisively.

==Typhus outbreak==

In 1847 there was a major outbreak of typhus in Montreal among Irish immigrants. Mills organized measures to contain the epidemic and volunteered to tend to the sick, whereupon he contracted the disease himself and died after less than one year in office.

He shared the Venice Film Festival‘s Volpi Cup for Best Actor as part of the ensemble cast of Robert Altman film &quot;Streamers&quot; (1983). He went on to play lead roles in several high-profile films throughout the 1980s, including &quot;Birdy&quot; (1984), &quot;Vision Quest&quot; (1985), and &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988). He gained further prominence for playing U.S. Marine James T. &quot;Joker&quot; Davis in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987). 

Other notable films include &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; (1990), &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; (1995), &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), and &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023).

He was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special for &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Modine, the youngest of seven children, was born on March 22, 1959, in Loma Linda, California, the son of Dolores (née Warner), a bookkeeper, and Mark Alexander Modine, who managed drive-in theaters. He is the nephew of the stage actress Nola Modine Fairbanks, and the great-grandson of the prospector and pioneer Ralph Jacobus Fairbanks. One of his other great-grandfathers was a Swedish immigrant. Modine lived in Utah for several years, moving every year or two. The drive-in theaters his father managed were being torn down because the land beneath them exceeded the value of the theaters. The Modine family returned to Imperial Beach, California, where Matthew attended and graduated from Mar Vista High School in 1977.

== Career ==
=== Film ===
Modine&#x27;s first film role was in John Sayles&#x27; film &quot;Baby It&#x27;s You&quot; (1983). Also that year, he co-starred in the sex comedy &quot;Private School&quot;, with Phoebe Cates and Betsy Russell. His performances caught the eye of director Harold Becker, who cast him in &quot;Vision Quest&quot; (1985, filmed 1983), based on Terry Davis&#x27;s novel. The director Robert Altman propelled Modine to international stardom with his 1983 film adaptation of David Rabe&#x27;s play &quot;Streamers&quot;. Modine played Mel Gibson&#x27;s brother in &quot;Mrs. Soffel&quot; (1984) and starred with Nicolas Cage in Alan Parker&#x27;s &quot;Birdy&quot; (1984); the film was awarded Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival. Modine turned down the role of LT Pete &quot;Maverick&quot; Mitchell in &quot;Top Gun&quot; (played by Tom Cruise), because he felt the film&#x27;s pro-military stance went against his politics.
Modine may be best known for his role as Private/Sergeant J.T. &quot;Joker&quot; Davis, the central character of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s Vietnam War film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987). Subsequently, Modine played the dangerous young criminal Treat in Alan Pakula&#x27;s 1987 film adaptation of Lyle Kessler&#x27;s stageplay &quot;Orphans&quot;. Modine played the goofy, earnest FBI agent Mike Downey in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s screwball comedy &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988) opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. In 1990, he led the cast of &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;, a fictionalized account of the B-17 Flying Fortress. Modine&#x27;s subsequent roles included Drake Goodman in the thriller &quot;Pacific Heights&quot; (1990), Dr. Don Francis in the HBO film &quot;And the Band Played On&quot; (1993), and Dr. Ralph Wyman in the Robert Altman film &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993). For his work in &quot;And the Band Played On&quot;, he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television and for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Special, and for his work in &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, he received a special Golden Globe Award for the ensemble cast. 

In 1995, Modine appeared opposite Geena Davis in the romantic action-adventure film &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot;. He was nominated for a second Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television for his work in the 1997 television film &quot;What the Deaf Man Heard&quot;. Modine made his feature directorial debut with &quot;If... Dog... Rabbit...&quot; (1999), which came after the success of three short films debuting at the Sundance Film Festival: &quot;When I Was a Boy&quot;, co-directed with Todd Field; &quot;Smoking&quot;, written by David Sedaris; and &quot;Ecce Pirate&quot;, written by Modine.

In 2003, he guest-starred in &quot;The West Wing&quot; episode &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;. He portrayed the character Marco, who went to high school with C.J. Cregg (Allison Janney) and who helped her deal with her father&#x27;s steady mental decline due to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Modine agreed to take the role because he is a longtime friend of Janney. (The two appeared together in a theatrical production of the play &quot;Breaking Up&quot; directed by Stuart Ross). That same year, he played Fritz Gerlich in the CBS miniseries &quot;&quot; (2003). 

In 2004, Modine appeared in &quot;Funky Monkey&quot; as ex-football star turned spy Alec McCall, who teams up with super-chimp Clemens and his friend Michael Dean (Seth Adkins) to take down the villainous Flick (Taylor Negron). The film was critically panned, yet has gained a cult status. In 2005, Abel Ferrara&#x27;s &quot;Mary&quot; won the Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. In the film, Modine portrays a director recounting the story of Mary Magdalene (Juliette Binoche). The following year, he guest-starred in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode &quot;Rage&quot; as a serial killer of young girls. In 2010, Modine appeared in &quot;The Trial&quot;, which was awarded the Parents Television Council&#x27;s Seal of Approval™. The PTC said: &quot;&#x27;The Trial&#x27; combines the best features of courtroom drama, murder mystery, and character story. &#x27;The Trial&#x27; is a powerful drama which shows the power of healing and hope.&quot; Modine played a corrupt Majestic City developer named &quot;Sullivan Groff&quot; throughout Season 3 on &quot;Weeds&quot;. Groff has affairs with Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker) and Celia Hodes (Elizabeth Perkins). Also in 2010, Modine appeared in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Too Big to Fail&quot;, a film about the Wall Street financial crisis. Modine stars as John Thain, former Chairman and CEO of Merrill Lynch. 

His dark comedy &quot;I Think I Thought&quot; (2008) debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival. The film tells the story of a Thinker (Modine) who ends up in Thinkers Anonymous. Other short films include &quot;To Kill an American&quot;, &quot;Cowboy&quot;, and &quot;The Love Film&quot;. In 2011, he completed &quot;Jesus Was a Commie&quot;, an avant-garde-dialectical conversation about the world and the prominent issues of modern society. Modine co-directed the short film with Terence Ziegler, the editor of &quot;I Think I Thought&quot;. Modine&#x27;s short films have played internationally. Modine completed two more independent films, &quot;Family Weekend&quot; (2013) and &quot;Girl in Progress&quot; (2012), opposite Eva Mendes. In 2012, he appeared in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; as Deputy Commissioner Peter Foley, a Gotham City police officer and peer to Gary Oldman&#x27;s Commissioner James Gordon. In February 2013, Modine was cast in Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s animated film &quot;Last Days of Coney Island&quot; after coming across the film&#x27;s Kickstarter campaign online. In 2014, he co-starred with Olivia Williams, Richard Dillane, and Steve Oram in the horror mystery film &quot;Altar&quot;. In 2015, he played Ivan Turing in the TNT supernatural medical drama &quot;Proof&quot;.

In 2016, Modine played Dr. Martin Brenner in the Netflix original series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. In 2017, he and his &quot;Stranger Things&quot; castmates won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. In 2017, Matthew Modine was featured in the music video for &quot;1-800-273-8255&quot;, a song by American hip hop artist Logic. Modine was part of &quot;Speed Kills&quot; released in November 2018 as well as several upcoming films such as &quot;Foster Boy&quot;, &quot;Miss Virginia&quot;, and &quot;The Martini Shot&quot;. In 2023 he portrayed Vannevar Bush in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s biographical thriller &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;.

=== Theater ===
Modine appeared in Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Finishing the Picture&quot; at Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre, in Miller&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection Blues&quot; at London&#x27;s Old Vic, and in a stage adaptation of Harper Lee&#x27;s &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (as Atticus Finch) at Connecticut&#x27;s Hartford Stage (This production of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; became the most successful play in the theatre&#x27;s 45-year history), and in 2022/23 at London&#x27;s Gielgud Theatre.

==Personal life==
Modine married Caridad Rivera, a makeup and wardrobe stylist, in 1980. They have two children: Boman, an assistant film director; and Ruby Modine, an actress, singer and ballet dancer.

Modine is the subject of the 2005 song &quot;Matthew Modine&quot; by Pony Up.

===Activism===

Cycling has been Modine&#x27;s main mode of transportation since he moved to New York City from Utah in 1980. He heads a pro-bike organization called &quot;Bicycle for a Day&quot; and was honored for his work on June 2, 2009, by the environmental arts and education center on the East River, Solar 1.

In 2019, Modine ran unsuccessfully for SAG-AFTRA national presidential election, challenging incumbent Gabrielle Carteris. Modine&#x27;s campaign manager and a number of other union members filed protests after the result, alleging election violations. The complaints were unsuccessful, and the investigation found no reason to set aside Cateris&#x27;s election. Modine ran again in 2021 and was defeated by Fran Drescher by a margin of 52.5% to 47.5%.

<doc id="542520" wikidata="Q3324325" url="?curid=542520" title="Flat morphism">
<text>In mathematics, in particular in the theory of schemes in algebraic geometry, a flat morphism &quot;f&quot; from a scheme &quot;X&quot; to a scheme &quot;Y&quot; is a morphism such that the induced map on every stalk is a flat map of rings, i.e.,

:formula_1

is a flat map for all &quot;P&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. A map of rings formula_2 is called flat if it is a homomorphism that makes &quot;B&quot; a flat &quot;A&quot;-module. A morphism of schemes is called faithfully flat if it is both surjective and flat.

Two basic intuitions regarding flat morphisms are: 
*flatness is a generic property; and 
*the failure of flatness occurs on the jumping set of the morphism.

The first of these comes from commutative algebra: subject to some finiteness conditions on &quot;f&quot;, it can be shown that there is a non-empty open subscheme formula_3 of &quot;Y&quot;, such that &quot;f&quot; restricted to &quot;Y&quot;′ is a flat morphism (generic flatness). Here &#x27;restriction&#x27; is interpreted by means of the fiber product of schemes, applied to &quot;f&quot; and the inclusion map of formula_3 into &quot;Y&quot;.

For the second, the idea is that morphisms in algebraic geometry can exhibit discontinuities of a kind that are detected by flatness. For instance, the operation of blowing down in the birational geometry of an algebraic surface can give a single fiber that is of dimension 1 when all the others have dimension 0. It turns out (retrospectively) that flatness in morphisms is directly related to controlling this sort of semicontinuity, or one-sided jumping.

Flat morphisms are used to define (more than one version of) the flat topos, and flat cohomology of sheaves from it. This is a deep-lying theory, and has not been found easy to handle. The concept of étale morphism (and so étale cohomology) depends on the flat morphism concept: an étale morphism being flat, of finite type, and unramified.

== Examples/non-examples ==
Consider the affine scheme morphism

:formula_5

induced from the morphism of algebras

:formula_6

Since proving flatness for this morphism amounts to computing

:formula_7

we resolve the complex numbers

:formula_8

and tensor by the module representing our scheme giving the sequence of formula_9-modules

:formula_10

Because is not a zero divisor we have a trivial kernel, hence the homology group vanishes.

=== Miracle flatness ===
Other examples of flat morphisms can be found using &quot;miracle flatness&quot; which states that if you have a morphism formula_11 between a Cohen–Macaulay scheme to a regular scheme with equidimensional fibers, then it is flat. Easy examples of this are elliptic fibrations, smooth morphisms, and morphisms to stratified varieties which satisfy miracle flatness on each of the strata.

===Hilbert schemes===
The universal examples of flat morphisms of schemes are given by Hilbert schemes. This is because Hilbert schemes parameterize universal classes of flat morphisms, and every flat morphism is the pullback from some Hilbert scheme. I.e., if formula_12 is flat, there exists a commutative diagram

: formula_13

for the Hilbert scheme of all flat morphisms to formula_14. Since formula_15 is flat, the fibers formula_16 all have the same Hilbert polynomial formula_17, hence we could have similarly written formula_18 for the Hilbert scheme above.

===Non-examples===

====Blowup====
One class of non-examples are given by blowup maps

:formula_19

One easy example is the blowup of a point in formula_20. If we take the origin, this is given by the morphism

:formula_21 sending formula_22

where the fiber over a point formula_23 is a copy of formula_24, i.e.,

:formula_25

which follows from

:formula_26

But for formula_27, we get the isomorphism

:formula_28

The reason this fails to be flat is because of the Miracle flatness lemma, which can be checked locally.

====Infinite resolution====
A simple non-example of a flat morphism is formula_29 This is because

:formula_30

is an infinite complex, which we can find by taking a flat resolution of ,

:formula_31

and tensor the resolution with , we find that

:formula_32

showing that the morphism cannot be flat. Another non-example of a flat morphism is a blowup since a flat morphism necessarily has equi-dimensional fibers.

==Properties of flat morphisms==
Let formula_11 be a morphism of schemes. For a morphism formula_34, let formula_35 and formula_36 The morphism &quot;f&quot; is flat if and only if for every &quot;g&quot;, the pullback formula_37 is an exact functor from the category of quasi-coherent formula_38-modules to the category of quasi-coherent formula_39-modules.

Assume formula_11 and formula_41 are morphisms of schemes and &quot;f&quot; is flat at &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. Then &quot;g&quot; is flat at formula_42 if and only if &quot;gf&quot; is flat at &quot;x&quot;. In particular, if &quot;f&quot; is faithfully flat, then &quot;g&quot; is flat or faithfully flat if and only if &quot;gf&quot; is flat or faithfully flat, respectively.

===Fundamental properties===
* The composite of two flat morphisms is flat.
* The fiber product of two flat or faithfully flat morphisms is a flat or faithfully flat morphism, respectively.
* Flatness and faithful flatness is preserved by base change: If &quot;f&quot; is flat or faithfully flat and formula_34, then the fiber product formula_44 is flat or faithfully flat, respectively.
* The set of points where a morphism (locally of finite presentation) is flat is open.
* If &quot;f&quot; is faithfully flat and of finite presentation, and if &quot;gf&quot; is finite type or finite presentation, then &quot;g&quot; is of finite type or finite presentation, respectively.

Suppose formula_11 is a flat morphism of schemes.

* If &quot;F&quot; is a quasi-coherent sheaf of finite presentation on &quot;Y&quot; (in particular, if &quot;F&quot; is coherent), and if &quot;J&quot; is the annihilator of &quot;F&quot; on &quot;Y&quot;, then formula_46, the pullback of the inclusion map, is an injection, and the image of formula_47 in formula_48 is the annihilator of formula_49 on &quot;X&quot;.
* If &quot;f&quot; is faithfully flat and if &quot;G&quot; is a quasi-coherent formula_50-module, then the pullback map on global sections formula_51 is injective.

Suppose formula_52 is flat. Let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be &quot;S&quot;-schemes, and let formula_53 and formula_3 be their base change by &quot;h&quot;.

* If formula_11 is quasi-compact and dominant, then its base change formula_56 is quasi-compact and dominant.
* If &quot;h&quot; is faithfully flat, then the pullback map formula_57 is injective.
* Assume formula_11 is quasi-compact and quasi-separated. Let &quot;Z&quot; be the closed image of &quot;X&quot;, and let formula_59 be the canonical injection. Then the closed subscheme determined by the base change formula_60 is the closed image of formula_53.

===Topological properties===
If formula_11 is flat, then it possesses all of the following properties:

*For every point &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot; and every generization &quot;y&quot;′ of , there is a generization &quot;x&quot;′ of &quot;x&quot; such that .
*For every point &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, formula_63.
*For every irreducible closed subset &quot;Y&quot;′ of &quot;Y&quot;, every irreducible component of &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;Y&quot;′) dominates &quot;Y&quot;′.
*If &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;′ are two irreducible closed subsets of &quot;Y&quot; with &quot;Z&quot; contained in &quot;Z&quot;′, then for every irreducible component &quot;T&quot; of &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;Z&quot;), there is an irreducible component &quot;T&quot;′ of &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;Z&quot;′) containing &quot;T&quot;.
*For every irreducible component &quot;T&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, the closure of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is an irreducible component of &quot;Y&quot;.
*If &quot;Y&quot; is irreducible with generic point &quot;y&quot;, and if &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;y&quot;) is irreducible, then &quot;X&quot; is irreducible.
*If &quot;f&quot; is also closed, the image of every connected component of &quot;X&quot; is a connected component of &quot;Y&quot;.
*For every pro-constructible subset &quot;Z&quot; of &quot;Y&quot;, formula_64.

If &quot;f&quot; is flat and locally of finite presentation, then &quot;f&quot; is universally open. However, if &quot;f&quot; is faithfully flat and quasi-compact, it is not in general true that &quot;f&quot; is open, even if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are noetherian. Furthermore, no converse to this statement holds: If &quot;f&quot; is the canonical map from the reduced scheme &quot;X&quot;red to &quot;X&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; is a universal homeomorphism, but for &quot;X&quot; non-reduced and noetherian, &quot;f&quot; is never flat.

If formula_11 is faithfully flat, then:
*The topology on &quot;Y&quot; is the quotient topology relative to &quot;f&quot;.
*If &quot;f&quot; is also quasi-compact, and if &quot;Z&quot; is a subset of &quot;Y&quot;, then &quot;Z&quot; is a locally closed pro-constructible subset of &quot;Y&quot; if and only if &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;Z&quot;) is a locally closed pro-constructible subset of &quot;X&quot;.

If &quot;f&quot; is flat and locally of finite presentation, then for each of the following properties P, the set of points where &quot;f&quot; has P is open:
*Serre&#x27;s condition S&quot;k&quot; (for any fixed &quot;k&quot;).
*Geometrically regular.
*Geometrically normal.

If in addition &quot;f&quot; is proper, then the same is true for each of the following properties:
*Geometrically reduced.
*Geometrically reduced and having &quot;k&quot; geometric connected components (for any fixed &quot;k&quot;).
*Geometrically integral.

===Flatness and dimension===
Assume formula_66 and formula_67 are locally noetherian, and let formula_11.

*Let &quot;x&quot; be a point of &quot;X&quot; and . If &quot;f&quot; is flat, then . Conversely, if this equality holds for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;X&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay, and &quot;Y&quot; is regular, and furthermore &quot;f&quot; maps closed points to closed points, then &quot;f&quot; is flat.
*If &quot;f&quot; is faithfully flat, then for each closed subset &quot;Z&quot; of &quot;Y&quot;, .
*Suppose &quot;f&quot; is flat and &quot;F&quot; is a quasi-coherent module over &quot;Y&quot;. If &quot;F&quot; has projective dimension at most &quot;n&quot;, then formula_49 has projective dimension at most &quot;n&quot;.

===Descent properties===
* Assume &quot;f&quot; is flat at &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. If &quot;X&quot; is reduced or normal at &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;Y&quot; is reduced or normal, respectively, at &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Conversely, if &quot;f&quot; is also of finite presentation and &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;y&quot;) is reduced or normal, respectively, at &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;X&quot; is reduced or normal, respectively, at &quot;x&quot;.
* In particular, if &quot;f&quot; is faithfully flat, then &quot;X&quot; reduced or normal implies that &quot;Y&quot; is reduced or normal, respectively. If &quot;f&quot; is faithfully flat and of finite presentation, then all the fibers of &quot;f&quot; reduced or normal implies that &quot;X&quot; is reduced or normal, respectively.
* If &quot;f&quot; is flat at &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, and if &quot;X&quot; is integral or integrally closed at &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;Y&quot; is integral or integrally closed, respectively, at &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).
* If &quot;f&quot; is faithfully flat, &quot;X&quot; is locally integral, and the topological space of &quot;Y&quot; is locally noetherian, then &quot;Y&quot; is locally integral.
* If &quot;f&quot; is faithfully flat and quasi-compact, and if &quot;X&quot; is locally noetherian, then &quot;Y&quot; is also locally noetherian.
* Assume &quot;f&quot; is flat and &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are locally noetherian. If &quot;X&quot; is regular at &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;Y&quot; is regular at &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Conversely, if &quot;Y&quot; is regular at &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) is regular at &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;X&quot; is regular at &quot;x&quot;.
* Assume &quot;f&quot; is flat and &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are locally noetherian. If &quot;X&quot; is normal at &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;Y&quot; is normal at &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Conversely, if &quot;Y&quot; is normal at &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) is normal at &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;X&quot; is normal at &quot;x&quot;.

Let be faithfully flat. Let &quot;F&quot; be a quasi-coherent sheaf on &quot;Y&quot;, and let &quot;F&quot;′ be the pullback of &quot;F&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;′. Then &quot;F&quot; is flat over &quot;Y&quot; if and only if &quot;F&quot;′ is flat over &quot;Y&quot;′.

Assume &quot;f&quot; is faithfully flat and quasi-compact. Let &quot;G&quot; be a quasi-coherent sheaf on &quot;Y&quot;, and let &quot;F&quot; denote its pullback to &quot;X&quot;. Then &quot;F&quot; is finite type, finite presentation, or locally free of rank &quot;n&quot; if and only if &quot;G&quot; has the corresponding property.

Suppose is an &quot;S&quot;-morphism of &quot;S&quot;-schemes. Let be faithfully flat and quasi-compact, and let &quot;X&quot;′, &quot;Y&quot;′, and &quot;f&quot;′ denote the base changes by &quot;g&quot;. Then for each of the following properties P, if &quot;f&quot;′ has P, then &quot;f&quot; has P.

*Open.
*Closed.
*Quasi-compact and a homeomorphism onto its image.
*A homeomorphism.
Additionally, for each of the following properties P, &quot;f&quot; has P if and only if &quot;f&quot;′ has P.
*Universally open.
*Universally closed.
*A universal homeomorphism.
*Quasi-compact.
*Quasi-compact and dominant.
*Quasi-compact and universally bicontinuous.
*Separated.
*Quasi-separated.
*Locally of finite type.
*Locally of finite presentation.
*Finite type.
*Finite presentation.
*Proper.
*An isomorphism.
*A monomorphism.
*An open immersion.
*A quasi-compact immersion.
*A closed immersion.
*Affine.
*Quasi-affine.
*Finite.
*Quasi-finite.
*Integral.

It is possible for &quot;f&quot;′ to be a local isomorphism without &quot;f&quot; being even a local immersion.

If &quot;f&quot; is quasi-compact and &quot;L&quot; is an invertible sheaf on &quot;X&quot;, then &quot;L&quot; is &quot;f&quot;-ample or &quot;f&quot;-very ample if and only if its pullback &quot;L&quot;′ is &quot;f&quot;′-ample or &quot;f&quot;′-very ample, respectively. However, it is not true that &quot;f&quot; is projective if and only if &quot;f&quot;′ is projective. It is not even true that if &quot;f&quot; is proper and &quot;f&quot;′ is projective, then &quot;f&quot; is quasi-projective, because it is possible to have an &quot;f&quot;′-ample sheaf on &quot;X&quot;′ which does not descend to &quot;X&quot;.

<text>The list of Ohio Townships provides an alphabetic list of the 1362 current and historic townships in Ohio. While some have been totally absorbed into cities or villages, becoming paper townships, the list does not give historic names for any that were renamed.

The 2018-2019 Ohio Municipal, Township and School Board Roster (maintained by the Ohio Secretary of State) lists 1,308 townships, with a 2010 population totaling 5,623,956. When paper townships are excluded, but name variants counted separately (e.g. &quot;Brush Creek&quot; versus &quot;Brushcreek&quot;, &quot;Vermilion&quot; versus &quot;Vermillion&quot;), there are 618 different names used by townships statewide, including 451 names used only once. On the opposite end of the spectrum, forty-three townships are named &quot;Washington&quot;, and eight other names are used for twenty or more townships each.

<doc id="542529" wikidata="Q1863438" url="?curid=542529" title="Thomas Crawford (sculptor)">
<text>Thomas Gibson Crawford (March 22, 1814 – October 10, 1857) was an American sculptor who is best known for his numerous artistic contributions to the United States Capitol, including the &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot; atop its dome.

==Early life==
Crawford was born in New York City in 1814, of Irish parentage, the son of Aaron and Mary (née Gibson) Crawford. In his early years, he was at school with Page, the artist. His proficiency in his studies was hindered by the exuberance of his fancy, which took form in drawings and carvings. His love of art led him, at the age of 19, to enter the New York City studios of John Frazee and Robert Eberhard Launitz, artists and artificers in marble.

In 1834, he went abroad for the promotion of artistic studies, and in the summer of 1835 took up his residence in Rome, for life as it proved. Launitz had provided Crawford with a letter of introduction to Bertel Thorvaldsen and upon arriving in Rome, Crawford became a pupil of Thorwaldsen. Under his guidance, Crawford devoted himself to the study both of the antique and of living models.

==Career==

His first ideal work was a group of &quot;Orpheus and Cerberus&quot;, executed in 1839, and purchased, some years later, for the Boston Athenaeum, and now displayed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. This was followed by a succession of groups, single figures, and bas-reliefs, whose rapid production bore witness to the fertility as well as the versatility of his genius. Among these are &quot;Adam and Eve&quot; and a bust of Josiah Quincy, in 1900 in the Boston Athenaeum; &quot;Hebe and Ganymede&quot;, presented to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts by C. C. Perkins, and a bronze statue of Beethoven, presented by the same gentleman to the Boston Music Hall, which now resides at the New England Conservatory; &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;, in the Lenox Library; &quot;Mercury and Psyche&quot;; &quot;Flora&quot;, now in the gallery of the late Mrs. A. T. Stewart; an Indian girl; &quot;Dancing Jenny&quot;, modelled from his own daughter; and a statue of James Otis, which once adorned the chapel at Mount Auburn Cemetery, Cambridge. In 1838, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.
In 1849, while on a visit to this country, he received from the state of Virginia an order for a monument to be erected in Richmond. He immediately returned to Rome and began the work, of which the design was a star of five rays, each one of these bearing a statue of some historic Virginian, Patrick Henry and Thomas Jefferson among the number. The work is surmounted by a plinth, on which stands an equestrian statue of George Washington. These statues, modeled in Rome, were cast at a Munich foundry.

===U.S. Capitol===
Crawford&#x27;s most important works after these were ordered by the federal government for the United States Capitol at Washington. First among these was a marble pediment bearing life-size figures symbolical of the progress of American civilization; next in order came a bronze figure &quot;Freedom Triumphant in War and Peace&quot; which surmounts the dome; and last of these, and of his life-work, was a bronze door on which are modelled various scenes in the public life of Washington. Prominent among Crawford&#x27;s works was also his statue of an Indian chief, much admired by the English sculptor Gibson, who proposed that a bronze copy of it should be retained in Rome as a lasting monument.

His major accomplishments include the figure above the dome of the United States Capitol entitled &quot;Freedom Triumphant in War and Peace&quot;, the &quot;Revolutionary War Door&quot; in the House wing, and the bronze doors and pediment statues for the Senate wing. He was only able to begin the bas-reliefs for the bronze doors, which were afterwards completed by W. H. Rinehart.

==Personal life==
In 1844, he married Louisa Cutler Ward, a daughter of Julia (née Cutler) Ward and banker Samuel Ward. Among her siblings was brother Samuel Cutler Ward, who married Emily Astor (daughter of William Backhouse Astor Sr.) and sister Julia Ward, who married Samuel Gridley Howe. Together, Thomas and Louisa were the parents of four children, including:

* Mary Crawford Fraser (1851–1922), a writer who in 1874 married diplomat Hugh Fraser (1837–1894), who served as the United Kingdom&#x27;s Ambassador to Japan from 1889 to 1894 during the reign of Queen Victoria and Emperor Meiji.
* Francis Marion Crawford (1854–1909), a writer who married Elizabeth Berdan, the daughter of the Union General Hiram Berdan, in 1884.
* Anne Crawford, Baroness von Rabé (1846-1912), writer of an early vampire story, &quot;A Mystery of the Campagna&quot;.

In politics he was a liberal, in religion a Protestant, in character generous and kindly, and adverse to discords, professional or social.

Crawford began experiencing significant deterioration in his vision in 1856, which ended his career. He sought medical treatment in Paris, Rome, and London, and physicians discovered cancer of the eye and cancer of the brain. He died in London on October 10, 1857. His body was returned to the United States, and buried in an unmarked grave at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

* &quot;Mexican Girl Dying&quot; (1848)
* &quot;Statue of Freedom&quot; (1862)
* Progress of Civilization Pediment (1863)

<text>Arachidic acid, also known as icosanoic acid, is a saturated fatty acid with a 20-carbon chain. It is a minor constituent of cupuaçu butter (7%), perilla oil (0–1%), peanut oil (1.1–1.7%), corn oil (3%), and cocoa butter (1%). The salts and esters of arachidic acid are known as arachidates.

Its name derives from the Latin &quot;arachis&quot;—peanut. It can be formed by the hydrogenation of arachidonic acid.

Reduction of arachidic acid yields arachidyl alcohol.

Arachidic acid is used for the production of detergents, photographic materials and lubricants.

<text>Kelvinbridge is the common name of the Great Western Bridge, a cast iron road and pedestrian bridge located in the West End of the city of Glasgow, Scotland, built to carry the Great Western Road (A82) at a high level across the River Kelvin. Completed in 1891 by Bell &amp; Miller, it replaced an older stone bridge (completed 1840), and has a similar design to the Partick Bridge crossing the same river, located a short distance to the south-west. It has been a Category A listed structure since 1986.

In the early 19th century, the first Great Western Bridge (1825) provided a crossing point across the boundary of the city and into the neighbouring burgh of Hillhead, which was incorporated into the city later. It was at a low level, whereas the second, larger bridge was built over a high span.

The river lends its name to adjacent places at several points along its course (Kelvindale, Kelvingrove Park, Kelvinhaugh and Kelvinside for example) and so there are several &#x27;Kelvin Bridges&#x27;, including one several miles away in Torrance.
Adjacent to the bridge is Kelvinbridge subway station on the Glasgow Subway - one of the deepest on the circuit due to the proximity of the river - on the south east-side of the bridge. This was also the location of Kelvinbridge railway station on the Glasgow Central Railway. Due to these other uses, the name Kelvinbridge is also used to refer to the residential areas in the vicinity of the bridge, encompassing parts of the neighbourhoods of Woodside, Woodlands, Kelvinside and Hillhead.

The Glasgow Academy private school is nearby on the Hillhead side of the valley, with Lansdowne Church (1863) - featuring a spire which at is among the tallest structures in the city - on the opposite bank. Due to the proximity of the University of Glasgow, the Kelvinbridge locality accommodates many students. In 2019, the area was included in a list of the 50 &quot;coolest neighbourhoods in the world&quot; by Time Out magazine.

<text>Tintin and the Lake of Sharks () is a 1972 French-Belgian animated adventure film based on &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, directed by Raymond Leblanc. It was not written by Hergé (who merely supervised), but by the Belgian comics creator Greg (Michel Regnier), a friend of Hergé. It was later adapted into a comic book with still images from the film used as illustrations

==Plot==
One night, in Brussels, Belgium, a pair of criminals discreetly break into the aquarium and steal a large priceless pearl. As soon as the security guards on duty see the empty shell, they rush away to raise the alarm. The criminals take advantage of the guards&#x27; absence by discreetly placing a fake pearl, the same size as the real one, in the shell. When the guards return with the director and the director sees the fake pearl, he thinks the guards were making it up, but then has second thoughts about the incident as a similar case happened at another museum two weeks before.

Meanwhile, Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock arrive in Syldavia, a country in the Balkans. They have come to join their friend Professor Calculus who has rented a villa near a lake in order to build his latest invention. At the airport they run into Thompson and Thomson, who are also heading for Calculus on a special mission.

The four men and dog fly by hired plane to Calculus&#x27; house, but during the flight they get into some engine trouble and the pilot bails out with the only parachute. Tintin attempts to safely land the plane, but it ends up on the edge of a cliff and on fire. They are saved with the help of two local children, Niko and his sister Nushka, and their dog Gustav. But as it turns out, the crash was deliberately set up, as the pilot contacts his superior (&quot;Mr. Big&quot;/&quot;King Shark&quot;) via a walkie-talkie, hidden in his binoculars, to inform him that the plan has failed.

The children give their new friends a lift in their wagon, but as they learn of their destination, they warn them that there is a curse on the lake, at the bottom of which is an old submerged town. The party finally arrives at Calculus&#x27; villa where he demonstrates his invention: a camera which can project holographic images. His ultimate aim is to create a machine which will make actual copies of physical objects. Later, over dinner, Thompson and Thomson explain that they are Calculus&#x27; bodyguards as they suspect that a criminal organization specializing in making art forgeries wants to steal his machine. Eventually, everybody goes to bed. In the middle of the night, Snowy wakes up Tintin at one point after hearing a noise outside, but Tintin shakes it off as bird calls. In fact, the noise is made by Calculus&#x27; housekeeper, Madame Flik, who is in league with &quot;Mr. Big&quot; as well.

Next morning, while Tintin explores the local country with Niko and Nushka (unaware that there are cameras spying on his every move), and the Captain and the detectives play a game of golf, Snowy runs into a frogman who has obtained from Madame Black some plans stolen from Calculus&#x27; laboratory. The frogman escapes by jumping into the lake, but Snowy manages to bite off a part of one of his flippers. After the Captain and the detectives tell Tintin what has happened, he gives the dogs the bitten-off flipper to sniff. While Gustav leads Haddock to a pile of abandoned tires, Tintin follows Snowy to a buried chain which, when pulled, opens a passage to a hidden cave where the criminals have stashed the stolen art. After getting sealed inside the cave, Tintin finds an underwater tunnel leading out to the lake. On his way through, Tintin gets trapped by a wire net, but Snowy (who remained outside the cave) dives in and chews through the net, saving Tintin from drowning.

Back at home, Calculus demonstrates his new invention to the children—a machine that can copy any object from a piece of special soap. Unfortunately the effects are as yet short-lived, as the copied objects shortly turn back into their original substance. The criminals attack Calculus and the detectives with laughing gas and take the children away. Tintin and Haddock pursue them but fail to rescue Niko and Nushka. The criminals leave behind a message on a tape player from their leader, &quot;King Shark&quot;, who tells the heroes (with a voice which is startingly familiar to Tintin) that they will get the children back in return for Calculus&#x27; invention. Tintin himself is to do the exchange and is not to call the police.

Tintin, Haddock, Calculus and the detectives search the house for bugs, and Tintin discovers a secret passage that leads to Madame Black&#x27;s walkie-talkie hidden in the empty well, catching Madam Black in the process. Tintin decides to contact the police and comes up with a ruse to cover his tracks. Tintin and Snowy set off to the local town and just happen to meet their old friend, the opera singer Bianca Castafiore, who gives him a lift in her car to the town and even helps him in getting to the police. The chief of police listens to his story, but he is limited in what he can do since half the lake is in the jurisdiction of Borduria, a rival nation, and there are thus risks of a diplomatic incident.

Two days pass before Tintin finally returns to Calculus&#x27; house with the shark-like submarine which Calculus built during the search for &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;. The plan is that Tintin will meet the crooks on the beach, and Haddock will follow him in the sub. At the meeting point, criminals pick Tintin up in a submarine, and they head underwater to the flooded city where their base is situated. The mastermind behind this operation is revealed to be none other than Tintin&#x27;s nemesis Rastapopoulos, now calling himself &quot;King Shark&quot;/&quot;Mr. Big&quot;. Rastapopoulos promises to set Niko and Nushka free for the device, but, unaware of Tintin&#x27;s arrival, the children escape from their cell and hijack an underwater tank.

Rastapopoulos takes over control of the tank with his computer, but he then notices Captain Haddock&#x27;s sub on his monitor and uses the tank to fire torpedoes at Haddock, which provokes a fight between Tintin and the other gangsters as he attempts to stop Rastapopoulos. Haddock&#x27;s mini-sub is hit, jamming its propulsion, and the tank is returned to the base by remote control. While waiting for the children to return, Rastapopoulos takes Tintin to his office and shows him his art collection, gloating that with Calculus&#x27; machine, they can make multiple copies of all the stolen masterpieces and sell them off for huge amounts of money.

Rastapopoulos tries out Calculus&#x27; machine by cloning a cigar box, but the imitation proves highly unstable and grows to monstrous size, almost crushing Rastapopoulos and his lieutenant. In a rage, Rastapopoulos locks Tintin and the children in a chamber, but then learns that police boats are patrolling the lake. He therefore decides to evacuate the base and orders his men to take all the art he has in the underwater city to the cave. He then floods the chamber Tintin and the children are in with water. As soon as the water has reached a device high on the wall, the base will self-destruct.

Haddock manages to regain control of the disabled submarine and makes his way to the surface, encountering Thompson and Thomson and the chief of the Syldavian police in a patrol boat. Down below, with all of his men having evacuated the base, Rastapopoulos and his lieutenant leave the base in the submarine. Tintin and the children manage to get free and escape through an airlock in life jackets, just before the base explodes. They then reach the surface and rejoin their friends and the police. The police have captured all of Rastapopoulos&#x27; men, but the mastermind himself has already crossed the border in his submarine. Since they are not Syldavian officials and therefore not bound by international conventions, Tintin and Haddock insist in going after Rastapopoulos in a motor boat.

In order to pass the border posts, Rastapopoulos tries to navigate the sub through an underwater tunnel, but forgets to lower the sub&#x27;s periscope, which hits a low rock and breaks, causing the sub to crash and get flooded. The villains make for the surface, but they are captured by Tintin and Haddock as soon as they attempt to leave the wrecked vessel. In the end, the Thompsons, Calculus, Niko, Nushka, and Gustav welcome Tintin, Snowy and Haddock back from their submarine vessel mission. Finally, Rastapopoulos and his seamen are taken away to Klow Prison by Syldavian Police Officials. Tintin, Snowy and Haddock return to Calculus&#x27; villa and are welcomed by a huge party of villagers who want to celebrate the end of the terror imposed by the gang, and Bianca Castafiore, who makes Haddock flee the party. Haddock tries to have a quiet moment to drink some whiskey, but gets his bottle destroyed by the Thompson twins playing golf. Initially, the captain is annoyed but laughs over it with everyone.

<doc id="542549" wikidata="Q1045096" url="?curid=542549" title="South Kensington">
<text>South Kensington is a district just west of Central London in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Historically it settled on part of the scattered Middlesex village of Brompton. Its name was supplanted with the advent of the railways in the late 19th century and the opening (and shutting) and naming of local tube stations. The area has many museums and cultural landmarks with a high number of visitors, such as the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Adjacent affluent centres such as Knightsbridge, Chelsea and Kensington, have been considered as some of the most exclusive real estate in the world.

==History==
Following the 1851 Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, an area, west of what is now Exhibition Road, was purchased by the commissioners of the exhibition, in order to create a base for institutions dedicated to the arts and sciences, leading to the foundation of the Royal Albert Hall, three museums, the Royal School of Mines later a world renowned technological university, the Royal College of Music and the Royal College of Organists there. The market gardens of the rural area began to make way for a series of hospitals, such as the Brompton Hospital and the New Cancer Hospital along nearby Fulham Road. Adjacent landowners began to develop the land in the 1860s as a result of the transport hub and the general urbanisation boom west of London, and led to the eventual absorption of Brompton and its station into Kensington. It was sealed by the arrival of the Metropolitan and District Railways at Brompton, but for public relations reasons, it was re-named &quot;South Kensington&quot; in 1868. To facilitate public access to the museums, the railway company built a pedestrian tunnel directly from the station concourse to an exit halfway up Exhibition Road, next to the now defunct Royal Mail sorting office, to avoid crowds having to cross the Cromwell Road.

In 1906 the new Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway company opened the Brompton Road tube station in the vicinity, thus adding a link directly to the political, commercial and financial heart of the capital in Westminster, the West End and the City of London, but owing to under use, it was shut in 1934. During the Second World War it was used by the 26th (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade.

Since the First World War it has become a cosmopolitan area attracting Belgian and French refugees, but also Poles during the Second World War and after, as well as latterly Spanish, Italian, and American expatriates. Some residents also have a Middle Eastern origin. The French presence is emphasised by the Lycée Français Charles de Gaulle, the French Institute, housing a theatre now used as the Ciné Lumière with nearby the Alliance française, as well as the Consulate General of France, not far from the French Embassy in Knightsbridge. With a French bookshop and many international cafés in the area, it has been called &quot;Paris&#x27;s 21st arrondissement&quot;.

===Iranian Embassy siege===
In April and May 1980 a group of six Iranian Arabs entered the Iranian Embassy in South Kensington and took the staff, visitors and a diplomatic policeman hostage. There followed a six-day siege during which one of the hostages was killed. The British SAS finally stormed the building in a 17-minute operation, bringing out the hostages and the one surviving gunman, who was subsequently sentenced to 27 years in prison for his part in the offences.

==Geography==

As is often the case in other areas of London, the boundaries for South Kensington are arbitrary and have altered with time. This is due in part to usage arising from the tube stops and other landmarks which developed across Brompton. A contemporary definition is the commercial area around the South Kensington tube station and the adjacent garden squares and streets (such as Onslow Square and Thurloe Square, opposite the Victoria and Albert Museum). To the north is the Kensington Gore, to the south the winding Fulham Road and streets leading to Sloane Square and to the west, the residential and hotel area of Gloucester Road. South Kensington station lies on the junction of several thoroughfares: principally the Old Brompton Road, Harrington Road and Pelham Street and a stone&#x27;s throw from the arterial Cromwell Road. It is furthermore criss-crossed by the Exhibition Road and the stately Queen&#x27;s Gate and Prince Consort Road. Until road lay-out improvements in 2012, the area was afflicted with traffic congestion and likened to a series of traffic islands.

Modern development of the area is the result of the creation of the temporary &quot;Albertopolis&quot; reached by Exhibition Road, whose terrain now includes the Natural History Museum, the Geological Museum, the Science Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London Oratory and since 1915, the Lycée Français. Other local institutions include the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum, Polish Hearth Club, London Goethe-Institut, the Royal Albert Hall, Imperial College London, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal College of Art, the Royal College of Music and between 1903 and 1991, the Royal College of Organists, West London Air Terminal, the Ismaili Centre, London and the late comer 1960s Baden-Powell House some of which are administratively within the City of Westminster, but considered to be &quot;within range of South Kensington&quot;. Although the SW7 postcode mainly covers South Kensington, it goes into Knightsbridge. The only Royal Mail Post Office in South Kensington closed in 2019.

==Places of worship==
The first church to rise among the fields at Brompton was the socially notable, but widely considered architecturally ugly, Holy Trinity Brompton in 1829. It served a wide area from the Kensington Canal in the west to the Kensington Turnpike in the north. The first incumbent, one Percival Frye, just happened to be the nephew of Archdeacon Alfred Pott, vicar of the neighbouring Kensington parish. It was followed by:

* St Mary The Boltons (1849–1850)
* All Saints&#x27; Church, Ennismore Gardens (1849) by Lewis Vulliamy; in 1978 this became the Russian Orthodox Dormition Cathedral
* The Brompton Oratory (1853), an architecturally imposing Roman Catholic church 
* St Paul&#x27;s, Onslow Square (consecrated in 1860)
* St Peter&#x27;s, Cranley Gardens (1866–1867), since 1973 the Armenian cathedral in London
* St Stephen&#x27;s, Gloucester Road (1866–1867)
* St Augustine&#x27;s, Queen&#x27;s Gate (1877), a &quot;High church project&quot;
* Holy Trinity Prince Consort Road (1899)
* Deutsche Evangelische Christuskirche (1904–1905)

==Trivia==
The area is the subject of Donovan&#x27;s song &quot;Sunny South Kensington&quot;, about the area&#x27;s reputation as the hip part of London in the 1960s.

Roman Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965) was partly filmed in South Kensington.

Morgan cars, a British family-owned hand built sportscar company, operates a main dealership out of Astwood Mews in South Kensington.

Christie&#x27;s auction house had a second London salesroom in the Old Brompton Road, South Kensington from 1975, which primarily handled the middle market. Christie&#x27;s permanently closed the South Kensington salesroom in July 2017 as part of their restructuring plans announced March 2017. The closure was due in part to a considerable decrease in sales between 2015 and 2016 in addition to the company expanding its online presence.

Tim Waterstone opened his first eponymous Waterstones bookshop in 1982 in Old Brompton Road. It has given way to a Little Waitrose.

Caffè Nero also started life as a single coffee shop in Old Brompton Road, opened by Ian Semp in 1990. It was subsequently bought out and became a chain.

<doc id="542552" wikidata="Q5539857" url="?curid=542552" title="George Grant (philosopher)">
<text>George Parkin Grant (13 November 1918 – 27 September 1988) was a Canadian philosopher, university professor and social critic. He is known for his Canadian nationalism, a political conservatism that affirms the values of community, equality and justice and his critical, philosophical analysis of the social and political effects of limitless technological progress. As a practising Christian, Grant conceived of time as the moving image of an eternal order illuminated by love.

Many of his writings express a complex meditation on and dialogue with the great thinkers of Western civilization including the &quot;ancients&quot; such as Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine of Hippo as well as &quot;moderns&quot; such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Leo Strauss, James Doull, Simone Weil and Jacques Ellul. Grant distinguished between civilizations of antiquity in which people believed that sacred stories, rituals and myths revealed universal order and the civilizations of modernity that came into being with the rise of Western science, the rapid development of industrial technologies and the prevailing belief that human beings are free to create (or will) their own order.

&quot;We can hold in our minds the enormous benefits of technological society, but we cannot so easily hold the ways it may have deprived us,&quot; Grant wrote, &quot;because technique is ourselves.&quot; He argued that the technological society has destroyed &quot;the very systems of meaning&quot; along with the language that expressed the highest human purposes. &quot;Our vision of ourselves as freedom in an indifferent world could only have arisen in so far as we had analyzed to disintegration those systems of meaning, given in myth, philosophy and revelation, which had held sway over our progenitors.&quot;

Grant vigorously opposed euthanasia, which he defined as &quot;deliberately causing the death of someone who is not already dying,&quot; and abortion, except where the mother&#x27;s life is in danger, or in psychologically traumatizing instances of rape, especially of young girls. In the case of abortion, he argued that a woman&#x27;s right to choose one &quot;can only be made law by denying to another member of our species the right to exist&quot; and, in the case of euthanasia, he wrote that rather than killing patients, doctors can alleviate their pain and fear. He warned that legal access to euthanasia (or assisted suicide) and abortion on demand could result in the killing of people considered less human or less valuable such as the aged, handicapped or the infirm.

Although he is considered the main theoretician of red Toryism, he expressed dislike of the term when applied to his deeper philosophical interests, which he saw as his primary work as a thinker. Recent research on Grant uncovers his debt to a neo-Hegelian idealist tradition, Canadian idealism, that had a major influence on many Canadian scholars and Canadian political culture more broadly.

== Family ==
Grant was born in Toronto on 13 November 1918, the son of Maude Erskine (née Parkin) and William Lawson Grant. He came from a distinguished Canadian family of scholars and educators. His father was the principal of Upper Canada College, and his paternal grandfather George Monro Grant was the dynamic principal of Queen&#x27;s University. His maternal grandfather was Sir George Robert Parkin, also a principal at Upper Canada College, whose daughter Alice married Vincent Massey, the Canadian diplomat and first Canadian-born Governor General of Canada. Both of his grandfathers were strong proponents of the bonds between Canada and the British Empire, and this greatly influenced their grandson. His nephew Michael Ignatieff is a public intellectual and former Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian House of Commons. His niece Caroline Andrew was a political scientist. On 1 July 1947 he married Sheila Allen whom he had met at Oxford.

== Education and teaching ==
Grant was educated at Upper Canada College and Queen&#x27;s University from which he graduated with a history degree. He attended Balliol College at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, a trust his grandfather, George Parkin, had headed at one time. Upon winning the Rhodes Scholarship, he enrolled towards a degree in law at Oxford, but after the Second World War ended, and Grant had experienced a deeper personal engagement with Christianity, he decided to change studies. His Doctor of Philosophy research was interrupted by the war, and he was already teaching in Dalhousie University&#x27;s philosophy department when he completed his thesis, &quot;The Concept of Nature and Supernature in the Theology of John Oman&quot;, during a year-long sabbatical in 1950. Grant was a faculty member at Dalhousie twice (1947–1960, 1980–1988), and at York University (1960–1961; he resigned before teaching) and McMaster University&#x27;s religion department (1961–1980), which he founded and led in the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1977, he became an editorial advisor of the journal &quot;Dionysius&quot;, which published his essay &quot;Nietzsche and the Ancients: Philosophy and Scholarship&quot; in 1979.

In &quot;George Grant: A Biography&quot; his struggles as a self-taught philosopher are highlighted.

Grant was not readily accepted into the traditional academic community of scholars in Canada. Resistance was provoked by some of Grant&#x27;s less &quot;progressive&quot; stances, most notably the definition of philosophy he published in 1949: &quot;The study of philosophy is the analysis of the traditions of our society and the judgment of those traditions against our varying intuitions of the Perfections of God&quot;. Especially angered and upset was Fulton Anderson of the University of Toronto&#x27;s philosophy department. Grant&#x27;s definition is telling, in that it marks his take on philosophy&#x27;s human perspective, which did not necessarily include assumptions regarding the objectivity of science, or the acceptance of the Enlightenment&#x27;s fact–value distinction.

Throughout his career Grant was seen as a unique voice within academic institutions, and thus had strong appeal beyond the strict &quot;community of scholars&quot;. In fact, Grant criticized the trend in universities to move away from the &quot;unity&quot; of the traditional academy to a &quot;multi-versity&quot; comprising separate hives of undergraduate students, graduate students, professional faculties, and professors (years before the American Allan Bloom would become famous for similar themes).

Grant died from pancreatic cancer on 27 September 1988, at the age of 69.

== Politics and philosophy ==
In 1965 Grant published his most widely known work, &quot;Lament for a Nation&quot;, in which he deplored what he claimed was Canada&#x27;s inevitable cultural absorption by the United States, a phenomenon he saw as an instance of &quot;continentalism&quot;. He argued that the homogenizing effect in current affairs during the period when it was written would see the demise of Canadian cultural nationality. The importance of the text is reflected in its selection in 2005 as one of &quot;The Literary Review of Canada&quot; 100 most important Canadian books. Grant articulated a political philosophy which was becoming known as red Toryism. It promoted the collectivist and communitarian aspects of an older English conservative tradition, which stood in direct opposition to the individualist traditions of liberalism and subsequently neo-liberalism.

The subjects of his books, essays, public lectures, and radio addresses (many on CBC Radio in Canada) quite frequently combined philosophy, religion, and political thought. Grant strongly critiqued what he believed were the worst facets of modernity, namely unbridled technological advancement and a loss of moral foundations to guide humanity. He defined &quot;philosophy&quot; as the search for the &quot;purpose and meaning and unity [of] life&quot;. What he proposed in place of the modern spirit was a synthesis of Christian and Platonic thought which embodied contemplation of the &quot;good&quot;. It is a synthesis that was given form by his neo-Hegelian Canadian idealism, which had been a part of his upbringing (his grandfather had been student of John Caird and a close friend of John Watson) but only really took explicit form when he was introduced to Hegel&#x27;s work by James Doull.

His first book, &quot;Philosophy in the Mass Age&quot; (1959), was his most explicitly Hegelian book. It began as a series of CBC lectures, and in it he posed the question of how human beings can reconcile moral freedom with acceptance of the view that an order exists in the universe beyond space and time. He applied a neo-Hegelian concept of history to the modern dilemma of reconciling freedom and order. He saw history as the progressive development of humanity&#x27;s consciousness of freedom and argued that Canada&#x27;s unique combination of British traditional institutions and American individualism put it at the forefront of this final stage of history. In 1965, furious that the Liberal government had agreed to accept nuclear weapons, he published &quot;Lament for a Nation&quot;. At this point, Grant had been influenced by Leo Strauss and his neo-Hegelian conception of historical progress became more restrained, losing the hope that we had reached or were on the verge of reaching the fullest consciousness of freedom. &quot;Lament for a Nation&quot; created a sensation with its argument that Canada was destined to disappear into a universal and homogeneous state whose centre was the United States. The idea of progress had lost its connection to our moral development and had been co-opted into a utilitarian mastery of nature to satisfy human appetites. &quot;Technology and Empire&quot; (1969), a collection of essays edited by poet and friend Dennis Lee, deepened his critique of technological modernity; and &quot;Time as History&quot;, his 1969 Massey Lecture, explained the worsening predicament of the West through an examination of the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche. Grant&#x27;s works of the 1960s had a strong influence on the nationalist movement of the 1970s, though many of the New Left were uncomfortable with Grant&#x27;s conservatism, his conventional Anglican Tory beliefs, Christian-Platonist perspective, and his uncompromising position against abortion.

Grant&#x27;s last work was &quot;Technology and Justice&quot; (1986), which he prepared together with his wife, Sheila Grant. His three-decades-long meditation on French philosopher Simone Weil&#x27;s works led to the conclusion that there were fundamental moral and spiritual flaws in Western civilization, consigning it to a fate of inevitable collapse. Nevertheless, Grant affirmed his belief that a better civilization could eventually replace it.

==Honours==
In 1981, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for having &quot;become a major force in Canadian intellectual life&quot; and was also awarded the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s Pierre Chauveau Medal. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

In 1965 Grant&#x27;s book &quot;Lament for a Nation: The Defeat of Canadian Nationalism&quot; was voted one of &quot;The Literary Review of Canada&quot; 100 most important Canadian books.

<text>Patrick George Binns (born October 8, 1948), is a Canadian diplomat, the 30th premier of Prince Edward Island from 1996 to 2007 and Canadian Ambassador to Ireland from 2007 to 2010.

Binns has a long history of public service, most notably being the 30th Premier of PEI for 11 years, during which time he was the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island.

During his premiership, Binns was known as the province&#x27;s &quot;affable and unassuming premier.&quot;

He also served as Canada&#x27;s Consul General in Boston, Massachusetts.

==Before the premiership==

Binns was born in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, and graduated from the University of Alberta in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts. In 1971, he earned a Master of Arts in Community Development while working for the government of Alberta as a community development officer. In 1972, Binns began working for the Prince Edward Island Rural Development Council and met and married Carol MacMillan of Stratford, PEI. While working for the P.E.I. government from 1974 to 1978, Binns helped create and run the Regional Service Centres in the province&#x27;s east. In 1978, he received the Queen&#x27;s Silver of Jubilee for Outstanding Public Service.

Binns entered politics in 1978 when he was elected as a MLA for the district of 4th Kings. He was subsequently re-elected in 1979 and 1982, serving various portfolios as Minister of Industry (1983), Community Affairs (1980), Fisheries (1982–83), Environment (1979), Labour (1979), and Municipal Affairs (1979) under Premier James Lee.

From 1984 to 1988, Binns was the MP for Cardigan, serving as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries in the Brian Mulroney government. Binns subsequently established an edible bean farm in Hopefield (Island Bean Limited) and operated a management consultant firm, Pat Binns &amp; Associates.

==Premiership==

===First term (1996 to 2000)===

Binns entered the provincial PC Party leadership race to succeed Patricia Mella in 1996 and won a convincing first ballot victory on May 5 over Charlottetown businessman Wes MacAleer and O&#x27;Leary Veterinarian Dr. Gary Morgan. He immediately set about organizing the party for an election expected within months. Binns took over a party with only a single member in the 32 seat Provincial Legislature. Binns campaigned on a platform of strengthening health care and education, encouraging economic development, and energizing communities. A provincial election was planned for late May by Premier Catherine Callbeck, only to be called off by Callbeck at the last minute at a nominating convention on the night of the planned election call. Subsequent media polls showed a surge in popularity for the PC Party. Callbeck resigned shortly afterwards and a leadership convention was held in the fall, electing provincial Cabinet Minister Keith Milligan as Callbeck&#x27;s successor as Liberal leader and Premier.

Binns&#x27; PC Party defeated the Liberal Party led by Milligan in the general election on November 18, 1996, gathering 18 seats to the Liberals&#x27; 8, and the NDP&#x27;s 1. This was the first provincial general election contested under a new single member, 27 seat system, replacing the previous dual member, 16 seat system.

===Second term (2000 to 2003)===

Binns&#x27; won a second mandate in 2000 when his PC Party swept 26 of 27 seats, leaving a single opposition Liberal in the legislature. Both Liberal Party Leader Wayne Carew and NDP Leader Dr. Herb Dickieson were defeated.

The second term of the Binns government saw continued economic growth with new business investment, economic diversification, export and tourism growth, and construction of the Atlantic Technology Centre in Charlottetown as a catalyst for development of the burgeoning IT sector. Investments continued in education and health care for extensive school construction and repair, creation of the PEI Cancer Treatment Centre in Charlottetown and Prince County Hospital in Summerside. The province&#x27;s first Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was also passed. During this time Prince Edward Island launched Waste Watch, becoming the first Canadian province to offer waste management services to every home and business resulting in a 65% waste diversion rate and closure of many community landfills. Investments were also made to expand renewable energy use with the development of the North Cape Wind Farm in West Prince, strengthening Prince Edward Island&#x27;s credentials as a national leader in environmental sustainability.

Among the major issues during this period included major financial pressures in the farm sector as a result of plant disease, overcapacity and closure of the US border due to trade issues. The tourism industry also experienced a downturn in the face of post-9/11 travel concerns and rising energy prices.

In 2001, Binns&#x27; government inaugurated the Disability Support Program intended to provide assistive devices and social integration assistance to Islanders with disabilities. A Human Rights complaint questioned whether the program was &quot;a service in the context of the Prince Edward Island Human Rights Act&quot;. In 2003 Binns&#x27; government commissioned the Baker Report. The report documented complaints under the DSP. Funding was restored to the DSP in 2007.

===Third term (2003 to 2007)===

The 2003 provincial election was held on September 29, 2003. The election date coincided with Hurricane Juan, a category 2 hurricane which swept over the central part of the province during the early morning hours, causing several million dollars in property damage and disrupting electricity service for days. The election date was not delayed or canceled, although the decision to do so rested with the Chief Electoral Officer and not the premier. Despite the weather, there was a customary high voter turnout (83%).

The election resulted in 23 Progressive Conservatives and 4 Liberals being elected, returning the PCs to Government. The Liberals were led by new leader Robert Ghiz who had replaced Interim Leader Ron MacKinley that spring. Under the leadership of Binns the PC Party won its third consecutive majority government, becoming the first Conservative Premier to accomplish this feat in over a century.

Binns&#x27; popularity was tested as the government weathered challenges on many fronts. Unpredictability in federal equalization, coupled with rising health care and energy costs and weakness in the primary and tourism sectors, put pressure on provincial finances. Clashes with the federal government over the fiscal imbalance and fisheries management continued for several years. Binns launched a Program Renewal process to streamline duplication and improve delivery of public services. The provincial public service was reduced by several hundred people as services were reorganized and administrative overlap was reduced in the health sector, evidenced by the disappearance of doctors in West Prince. These measures, along with a steadily growing economy, have led to continued improvement of public finances.

Other reforms in health included expanded used of nurse practitioners and better utilization of ground ambulance services, increased use of technology to improve service delivery, focused strategies for recruitment and retention of health care professionals, and restructuring health care delivery to accommodate the needs of an aging population.

Binns&#x27; government waited for federal ruling on same-sex marriage before allowing it in Prince Edward Island in 2004.

Binns sought an unprecedented fourth term majority during the 2007 provincial election, running on a policy of continued good governance and job creation, pointing to the Island&#x27;s increased prosperity under his tenure. The Leader of the Official Opposition Robert Ghiz ran a campaign centred on the theme of change, as well as promising increased funding to health care and post-secondary education while reducing gasoline and property taxes. The Liberal Party won 23 of the 27 seats, reversing the standings in the legislature at the time of dissolution.

Had Binns won the 2007 election, he would have tied the record set by former premier Alex Campbell who is the only Prince Edward Island premier to have been elected to four consecutive terms. Binns and his cabinet resigned June 12, 2007, being succeeded by the administration led by Robert Ghiz.

On August 30, 2007, Binns resigned as the PEI Progressive Conservative Party leader and Opposition leader, upon being named Ambassador of Canada to Ireland by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. In 2010 Binns accepted an appointment in Boston, Massachusetts, as Canadian Consul General to New England, replacing Neil LeBlanc.

==Personal life==

He is the father of Rob, Mark, Brad, and Lilly Binns.

Binns has six grandchildren, Kristen, Andrew, Olivia, Jackson, Elodie and Lachlan and resides with his wife Carol on the family farm in Hopefield, Prince Edward Island.

<text>Clear Grits were reformers in the Canada West district of the Province of United Canada, a British colony that is now the Province of Ontario, Canada. Their name is said to have been given by George Brown, who said that only those were wanted in the party who were &quot;all sand and no dirt, clear grit all the way through&quot;.

Their support was concentrated among southwestern Canada West farmers, who were frustrated and disillusioned by the 1849 Reform government of Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine&#x27;s lack of democratic enthusiasm. The Clear Grits advocated universal male suffrage, representation by population, democratic institutions, reductions in government expenditure, abolition of the Clergy Reserves, voluntarism, and free trade with the United States. Clear Grits from Upper Canada shared many ideas with Thomas Jefferson.

==History==
The Clear Grit platform was first laid out at a convention held at Markham in March 1850, which included the following planks:

#The abrogation of the rectories, and the secularization of the Clergy Reserves.
#Retrenchment in provincial expenditure.
#Abolition of the pensioning system.
#The appointment of all local officials by local municipal councils.
#Thorough judicial reform, especially the abolition of the court of chancery.
#A great extension of the elective franchise, and vote by ballot.
#Repeal of the law of primogeniture.
#Abolition of copyright.
#The right of the people to discuss peacefully any question affecting the government or constitution of the colony.
#Election of the three branches of the legislature by the people of the dominion.

Initially led by Peter Perry, they later came under the leadership of Toronto newspaper editor George Brown, and in 1857 joined with the Reform Party, which was a loose alliance of liberal-minded reformers that became the Ontario Liberal Party and Liberal Party of Canada.

==Impact==
The &quot;Clear Grits&quot; was one of a long series of farmer-based radical reform movements. Later examples were the United Farmers and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, the direct ancestor of the modern New Democratic Party.

<text>The Drude model of electrical conduction was proposed in 1900 by Paul Drude to explain the transport properties of electrons in materials (especially metals). Basically, Ohm&#x27;s law was well established and stated that the current and voltage driving the current are related to the resistance of the material. The inverse of the resistance is known as the conductance. When we consider a metal of unit length and unit cross sectional area, the conductance is known as the conductivity, which is the inverse of resistivity. The Drude model attempts to explain the resistivity of a conductor in terms of the scattering of electrons (the carriers of electricity) by the relatively immobile ions in the metal that act like obstructions to the flow of electrons.

The model, which is an application of kinetic theory, assumes that the microscopic behaviour of electrons in a solid may be treated classically and behaves much like a pinball machine, with a sea of constantly jittering electrons bouncing and re-bouncing off heavier, relatively immobile positive ions.

In modern terms this is reflected in the valence electron model where the sea of electrons is composed of the valence electrons only, and not the full set of electrons available in the solid, and the scattering centers are the inner shells of tightly bound electrons to the nucleus. The scattering centers had a positive charge equivalent to the valence number of the atoms.
This similarity added to some computation errors in the Drude paper, ended up providing a reasonable qualitative theory of solids capable of making good predictions in certain cases and giving completely wrong results in others. 
Whenever people tried to give more substance and detail to the nature of the scattering centers, and the mechanics of scattering, and the meaning of the length of scattering, all these attempts ended in failures.

The scattering lengths computed in the Drude model, are of the order of 10 to 100 interatomic distances, and also these could not be given proper microscopic explanations.

Drude scattering is not electron–electron scattering which is only a secondary phenomenon in the modern theory, neither nuclear scattering given electrons can be at most be absorbed by nuclei. The model remains a bit mute on the microscopic mechanisms, in modern terms this is what is now called the &quot;primary scattering mechanism&quot; where the underlying phenomenon can be different case per case.

The model gives better predictions for metals, especially in regards to conductivity, and sometimes is called Drude theory of metals. This is because metals have essentially a better approximation to the free electron model, i.e. metals do not have complex band structures, electrons behave essentially as free particles and where, in the case of metals, the effective number of de-localized electrons is essentially the same as the valence number.

The two most significant results of the Drude model are an electronic equation of motion,
formula_1
and a linear relationship between current density and electric field ,
formula_2

Here is the time, ⟨p⟩ is the average momentum per electron and , and are respectively the electron charge, number density, mass, and mean free time between ionic collisions. The latter expression is particularly important because it explains in semi-quantitative terms why Ohm&#x27;s law, one of the most ubiquitous relationships in all of electromagnetism, should hold.

Steps towards a more modern theory of solids were given by the following:
* The Einstein solid model and the Debye model, suggesting that the quantum behaviour of exchanging energy in integral units or quanta was an essential component in the full theory especially with regard to specific heats, where the Drude theory failed.
* In some cases, namely in the Hall effect, the theory was making correct predictions if instead of using a negative charge for the electrons a positive one was used. This is now interpreted as holes (i.e. quasi-particles that behave as positive charge carriers) but at the time of Drude it was rather obscure why this was the case.

Drude used Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics for the gas of electrons and for deriving the model, which was the only one available at that time. By replacing the statistics with the correct Fermi Dirac statistics, Sommerfeld significantly improved the predictions of the model, although still having a semi-classical theory that could not predict all results of the modern quantum theory of solids.

== History ==
German physicist Paul Drude proposed his model in 1900 when it was not clear whether atoms existed, and it was not clear what atoms were on a microscopic scale. In his original paper, Drude made an error, estimating the Lorenz number of Wiedemann–Franz law to be twice what it classically should have been, thus making it seem in agreement with the experimental value of the specific heat. This number is about 100 times smaller than the classical prediction but this factor cancels out with the mean electronic speed that is about 100 times bigger than Drude&#x27;s calculation.

The first direct proof of atoms through the computation of the Avogadro number from a microscopic model is due to Albert Einstein, the first modern model of atom structure dates to 1904 and the Rutherford model to 1909. Drude starts from the discovery of electrons in 1897 by J.J. Thomson and assumes as a simplistic model of solids that the bulk of the solid is composed of positively charged scattering centers, and a sea of electrons submerge those scattering centers to make the total solid neutral from a charge perspective. The model was extended in 1905 by Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (and hence is also known as the Drude–Lorentz model) to give the relation between the thermal conductivity and the electric conductivity of metals (see Lorenz number), and is a classical model. Later it was supplemented with the results of quantum theory in 1933 by Arnold Sommerfeld and Hans Bethe, leading to the Drude–Sommerfeld model.

Nowadays the Drude and Sommerfeld models are still significant to understanding the qualitative behaviour of solids and to get a first qualitative understanding of a specific experimental setup. This is a generic method in solid state physics, where it is typical to incrementally increase the complexity of the models to give more and more accurate predictions. It is less common to use a full-blown quantum field theory from first principles, given the complexities due to the huge numbers of particles and interactions and the little added value of the extra mathematics involved (considering the incremental gain in numerical precision of the predictions).

== Assumptions ==
Drude used the kinetic theory of gases applied to the gas of electrons moving on a fixed background of &quot;ions&quot;; this is in contrast with the usual way of applying the theory of gases as a neutral diluted gas with no background. The number density of the electron gas was assumed to be 
formula_3
where &quot;Z&quot; is the effective number of de-localized electrons per ion, for which Drude used the valence number, &quot;A&quot; is the atomic mass per mole, formula_4 is the mass density (mass per unit volume) of the &quot;ions&quot;, and &quot;N&quot; is the Avogadro constant.
Considering the average volume available per electron as a sphere:
formula_5
The quantity formula_6 is a parameter that describes the electron density and is often of the order of 2 or 3 times the Bohr radius, for alkali metals it ranges from 3 to 6 and some metal compounds it can go up to 10.
The densities are of the order of 1000 times of a typical classical gas.

The core assumptions made in the Drude model are the following:
* Drude applied the kinetic theory of a dilute gas, despite the high densities, therefore ignoring electron–electron and electron–ion interactions aside from collisions.
* The Drude model considers the metal to be formed of a collection of positively charged ions from which a number of &quot;free electrons&quot; were detached. These may be thought to be the valence electrons of the atoms that have become delocalized due to the electric field of the other atoms.
* The Drude model neglects long-range interaction between the electron and the ions or between the electrons; this is called the independent electron approximation.
* The electrons move in straight lines between one collision and another; this is called free electron approximation.
* The only interaction of a free electron with its environment was treated as being collisions with the impenetrable ions core.
* The average time between subsequent collisions of such an electron is , with a memoryless Poisson distribution. The nature of the collision partner of the electron does not matter for the calculations and conclusions of the Drude model.
* After a collision event, the distribution of the velocity and direction of an electron is determined by only the local temperature and is independent of the velocity of the electron before the collision event. The electron is considered to be immediately at equilibrium with the local temperature after a collision.

Removing or improving upon each of these assumptions gives more refined models, that can more accurately describe different solids:
* Improving the hypothesis of the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics with the Fermi–Dirac statistics leads to the Drude–Sommerfeld model.
* Improving the hypothesis of the Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics with the Bose–Einstein statistics leads to considerations about the specific heat of integer spin atoms and to the Bose–Einstein condensate.
* A valence band electron in a semiconductor is still essentially a free electron in a delimited energy range (i.e. only a &quot;rare&quot; high energy collision that implies a change of band would behave differently); the independent electron approximation is essentially still valid (i.e. no electron–electron scattering), where instead the hypothesis about the localization of the scattering events is dropped (in layman terms the electron is and scatters all over the place).

== Mathematical treatment ==

=== DC field ===
The simplest analysis of the Drude model assumes that electric field is both uniform and constant, and that the thermal velocity of electrons is sufficiently high such that they accumulate only an infinitesimal amount of momentum between collisions, which occur on average every seconds.

Then an electron isolated at time will on average have been travelling for time since its last collision, and consequently will have accumulated momentum
formula_7

During its last collision, this electron will have been just as likely to have bounced forward as backward, so all prior contributions to the electron&#x27;s momentum may be ignored, resulting in the expression
formula_8

Substituting the relations
formula_9
results in the formulation of Ohm&#x27;s law mentioned above:
formula_10

=== Time-varying analysis ===
The dynamics may also be described by introducing an effective drag force. At time the electron&#x27;s momentum will be:
formula_11
where formula_12 can be interpreted as generic force (e.g. Lorentz force) on the carrier or more specifically on the electron. formula_13 is the momentum of the carrier with random direction after the collision (i.e. with a momentum formula_14) and with absolute kinetic energy 
formula_15

On average, a fraction of formula_16 of the electrons will not have experienced another collision, the other fraction that had the collision on average will come out in a random direction and will contribute to the total momentum to only a factor formula_17 which is of second order.

With a bit of algebra and dropping terms of order formula_18, this results in the generic differential equation
formula_19

The second term is actually an extra drag force or damping term due to the Drude effects.

=== Constant electric field ===
At time the average electron&#x27;s momentum will be
formula_20
and then
formula_21
where denotes average momentum and the charge of the electrons. This, which is an inhomogeneous differential equation, may be solved to obtain the general solution of
formula_22
for . The steady state solution, , is then
formula_23

As above, average momentum may be related to average velocity and this in turn may be related to current density,
formula_9
and the material can be shown to satisfy Ohm&#x27;s law formula_25 with a DC-conductivity :
formula_26

=== AC field ===

The Drude model can also predict the current as a response to a time-dependent electric field with an angular frequency . The complex conductivity is
formula_27

Here it is assumed that:
formula_28
In engineering, is generally replaced by (or ) in all equations, which reflects the phase difference with respect to origin, rather than delay at the observation point traveling in time.

{m} \\
\mathbf{j}(t) &amp;= \Re{\left(\mathbf{j}(\omega) e^{-i\omega t}\right)} \\
\mathbf{j}(\omega) &amp;= - n e \frac{\mathbf{p}(\omega)}{m}=\frac{(n e^2/m)\mathbf{E}(\omega)}{1/\tau -i \omega}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
defining the complex conductivity from:
formula_29
We have:
formula_30

The imaginary part indicates that the current lags behind the electrical field. This happens because the electrons need roughly a time to accelerate in response to a change in the electrical field. Here the Drude model is applied to electrons; it can be applied both to electrons and holes; i.e., positive charge carriers in semiconductors. The curves for are shown in the graph.

If a sinusoidally varying electric field with frequency formula_31 is applied to the solid, the negatively charged electrons behave as a plasma that tends to move a distance apart from the positively charged background. As a result, the sample is polarized and there will be an excess charge at the opposite surfaces of the sample.

The dielectric constant of the sample is expressed as
formula_32
where formula_33 is the electric displacement and formula_34 is the polarization density.

The polarization density is written as
formula_35
and the polarization density with electron density is
formula_36
After a little algebra the relation between polarization density and electric field can be expressed as
formula_37
The frequency dependent dielectric function of the solid is
formula_38

{mc} \times \mathbf{B} &lt;/math&gt; in the equation of motion
* we assumed spatially uniform field: this is true if the field does not oscillate considerably across a few mean free paths of electrons. This is typically not the case: the mean free path is of the order of Angstroms corresponding to wavelengths typical of X rays.
The following are Maxwell&#x27;s equations without sources (which are treated separately in the scope of plasma oscillations), in Gaussian units:
formula_39
Then
formula_40
or
formula_41
which is an electromagnetic wave equation for a continuous homogeneous medium with dielectric constant formula_42 in the Helmoltz form 
formula_43
where the refractive index is formula_44 and the phase velocity is formula_45 
therefore the complex dielectric constant is 
formula_46
which in the case formula_47 can be approximated to:
formula_48 In SI units the formula_49 in the numerator is replaced by formula_50 in the denominator.
At a resonance frequency formula_51, called the plasma frequency, the dielectric function changes sign from negative to positive and real part of the dielectric function drops to zero.
formula_52
The plasma frequency represents a plasma oscillation resonance or plasmon. The plasma frequency can be employed as a direct measure of the square root of the density of valence electrons in a solid. Observed values are in reasonable agreement with this theoretical prediction for a large number of materials. Below the plasma frequency, the dielectric function is negative and the field cannot penetrate the sample. Light with angular frequency below the plasma frequency will be totally reflected. Above the plasma frequency the light waves can penetrate the sample, a typical example are alkaline metals that becomes transparent in the range of ultraviolet radiation.

=== Thermal conductivity of metals ===
One great success of the Drude model is the explanation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. This was due to a fortuitous cancellation of errors in Drude&#x27;s original calculation. Drude predicted the value of the Lorenz number: 
formula_53
Experimental values are typically in the range of formula_54 for metals at temperatures between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius.
{e}\right)^2 = 1.11 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{W}\Omega/\text{K}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Thermopower ===
A generic temperature gradient when switched on in a thin bar will trigger a current of electrons towards the lower temperature side, given the experiments are done in an open circuit manner this current will accumulate on that side generating an electric field countering the electric current. This field is called thermoelectric field:
formula_55
and is called thermopower. The estimates by Drude are a factor of 100 low given the direct dependency with the specific heat.
formula_56
where the typical thermopowers at room temperature are 100 times smaller, of the order of microvolts.
{2e} = 0.43 \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{V/K} &lt;/math&gt;
where the typical thermopowers at room temperature are 100 times smaller of the order of microvolts.

== Accuracy of the model ==
The Drude model provides a very good explanation of DC and AC conductivity in metals, the Hall effect, and the magnetoresistance in metals near room temperature. The model also explains partly the Wiedemann–Franz law of 1853.

Drude formula is derived in a limited way, namely by assuming that the charge carriers form a classical ideal gas. When quantum theory is considered, the Drude model can be extended to the free electron model, where the carriers follow Fermi–Dirac distribution. The conductivity predicted is the same as in the Drude model because it does not depend on the form of the electronic speed distribution. However, Drude&#x27;s model greatly overestimates the electronic heat capacity of metals. In reality, metals and insulators have roughly the same heat capacity at room temperature. Also, the Drude model does not explain the scattered trend of electrical conductivity versus frequency above roughly 2 THz.

The model can also be applied to positive (hole) charge carriers.

=== Drude response in real materials ===
The characteristic behavior of a Drude metal in the time or frequency domain, i.e. exponential relaxation with time constant or the frequency dependence for stated above, is called Drude response. In a conventional, simple, real metal (e.g. sodium, silver, or gold at room temperature) such behavior is not found experimentally, because the characteristic frequency is in the infrared frequency range, where other features that are not considered in the Drude model (such as band structure) play an important role. But for certain other materials with metallic properties, frequency-dependent conductivity was found that closely follows the simple Drude prediction for . These are materials where the relaxation rate is at much lower frequencies. This is the case for certain doped semiconductor single crystals, high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases, and heavy-fermion metals.

<text>Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District was a local government district and civil parish in north west Kent, England from 1934 to 1965.

It was formed in 1934 from the former area of Chislehurst Urban District, Sidcup Urban District and part of Bromley Rural District.

==London Boroughs==
In 1965 the parish and urban district were abolished and the settlements split again, roughly by the A20 road. Chislehurst became part of the London Borough of Bromley while Sidcup and North Cray formed part of the London Borough of Bexley in Greater London.

<doc id="542583" wikidata="Q415635" url="?curid=542583" title="Cholinesterase">
<text>The enzyme cholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8, choline esterase; systematic name acylcholine acylhydrolase) catalyses the hydrolysis of choline-based esters:

: an acylcholine + H2O = choline + a carboxylate

Several of these serve as neurotransmitters. Thus, it is either of two enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of these cholinergic neurotransmitters, such as breaking acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid. These reactions are necessary to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation. For example, in muscle contraction, acetylcholine at a neuromuscular junction triggers a contraction; but for the muscle to relax afterward, rather than remaining locked in a tense state, the acetylcholine must be broken down by a choline esterase. The main type for that purpose is acetylcholinesterase (also called choline esterase I or erythrocyte cholinesterase); it is found mainly in chemical synapses and red blood cell membranes. The other type is butyrylcholinesterase (also called choline esterase II or plasma cholinesterase); it is found mainly in the blood plasma.

== Types and nomenclature ==

The two types of cholinesterase are acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE). They differ by their respective preferences for substrates; the former hydrolyses acetylcholine more quickly, while the latter hydrolyses butyrylcholine more quickly.

The term &quot;cholinesterase&quot; is sometimes used to refer specifically to butyrylcholinesterase, but this usage produces the oddity that &quot;cholinesterase&quot; and &quot;false cholinesterase&quot; (&quot;pseudocholinesterase&quot;) under that scheme mean the same thing (confusingly), and acetylcholinesterase is then called &quot;true cholinesterase&quot; in contrast, producing the second oddity that &quot;cholinesterase&quot; and &quot;true cholinesterase&quot; then do not mean the same thing. But such usage is now outdated; the current, unambiguous HGNC names and symbols are acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE).

Acetylcholinesterase () (ACHE), also known as AChE, choline esterase I, RBC cholinesterase, or erythrocyte cholinesterase, true cholinesterase, choline esterase I, or (most formally) acetylcholine acetylhydrolase, is found primarily in the blood on red blood cell membranes, in neuromuscular junctions, and in other neural synapses. Acetylcholinesterase exists in multiple molecular forms. In the mammalian brain the majority of AChE occurs as a tetrameric, G4 form (10) with much smaller amounts of a monomeric G1 (4S) form.

Butyrylcholinesterase () (BCHE), also known as cholinesterase, choline esterase II, BChE, BuChE, pseudocholinesterase (PCE), plasma cholinesterase (PChE), serum cholinesterase (SChE), butylcholinesterase, or (most formally) acylcholine acylhydrolase, is produced in the liver and found primarily in blood plasma. The butyl and butyryl syllables both refer to butane with one of its terminal methyl groups substituted.

The half-life of BCHE is approximately 10 to 14 days. BCHE levels may be reduced in patients with advanced liver disease. The decrease must be greater than 75% before significant prolongation of neuromuscular blockade occurs with succinylcholine.

== Discovery ==

In 1968, Walo Leuzinger &quot;et al.&quot; successfully purified and crystallized acetylcholinesterase from electric eels at Columbia University, New York.

The 3D structure of acetylcholinesterase was first determined in 1991 by Joel Sussman &quot;et al.&quot; using protein from the Pacific electric ray.

Clinically useful quantities of butyrylcholinesterase were synthesized in 2007 by PharmAthene, through the use of genetically modified goats.

== Clinical significance ==

An absence or mutation of the BCHE enzyme leads to a medical condition known as pseudocholinesterase deficiency. This is a silent condition that manifests itself only when people that have the deficiency receive the muscle relaxants succinylcholine or mivacurium during a surgery.

Pseudocholinesterase deficiency may also affect local anaesthetic selection in dental procedures. The enzyme plays an important role in the metabolism of ester-based local anaesthetics, a deficiency lowers the margin of safety and increases the risk of systemic effects with this type of anaesthetic. The selection of an amide-based solution is recommended in such patients.

Elevation of plasma BCHE levels was observed in 90.5% of cases of acute myocardial infarction.

The presence of ACHE in the amniotic fluid may be tested in early pregnancy. A sample of amniotic fluid is removed by amniocentesis, and presence of ACHE can confirm several common types of birth defect, including abdominal wall defects and neural tube defects.

BCHE can be used as a prophylactic agent against nerve gas and other organophosphate poisoning.

Some early research points to genetic butylcholinesterase deficiency as a possible candidate component in sudden infant death syndrome.

The enzyme Acetylcholin esterase, and its inhibition, plays a role in the development of myofascial trigger points and the associated myofascial pain syndrome. By injecting a mouse with acetylcholin esterase inhibitors and electrical stimulation, the muscle develops trigger points.

== Inhibitors ==

A cholinesterase inhibitor (or &quot;anticholinesterase&quot;) suppresses the action of the enzyme. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of cholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing excessive salivation and eye-watering in low doses, followed by muscle spasms and ultimately death (examples are some snake venoms, and the nerve gases sarin and VX). One counteracting medication is pralidoxime. The so-called nerve gases and many substances used in insecticides have been shown to act by combining with a residue of serine in the active site of acetylcholine esterase, inhibiting the enzyme completely. The enzyme acetylcholine esterase breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is released at nerve and muscle junctions, in order to allow the muscle or organ to relax. The result of acetylcholine esterase inhibition is that acetylcholine builds up and continues to act so that any nerve impulses are continually transmitted and muscle contractions do not stop.

Among the most common acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are phosphorus-based compounds, which are designed to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The structural requirements are a phosphorus atom bearing two lipophilic groups, a leaving group (such as a halide or thiocyanate), and a terminal oxygen. The entry on Lawesson&#x27;s reagent has some details on one sub-class of the phosphorus-based compounds.

Some benzodiazepines, e.g., temazepam have an inhibitory effect on cholinesterase.

Cholinesterase levels can be used as an indirect marker of arsenic exposure.

Outside of biochemical warfare, anticholinesterases are also used for reversing medication induced paralysis during anesthesia; as well as in the treatment of myasthenia gravis, glaucoma, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Such compounds are used for killing insects in a range of products including sheep dip, organophosphate pesticides, and carbamate pesticides. In addition to acute poisoning as described above, a semi-acute poisoning characterized by strong mental disturbances can occur. Also, prolonged exposure can cause birth defects.

<doc id="542587" wikidata="Q1751466" url="?curid=542587" title="Coaxial">
<text>In geometry, coaxial means that several three-dimensional linear or planar forms share a common axis. The two-dimensional analog is &quot;concentric&quot;.

Common examples:

A coaxial cable has a wire conductor in the centre (D), a circumferential outer conductor (B), and an insulating medium called the dielectric (C) separating these two conductors. The outer conductor is usually sheathed in a protective PVC outer jacket (A). All these have a common axis. The dimension and material of the conductors and insulation determine the cable&#x27;s characteristic impedance and attenuation at various frequencies.

Coaxial rotors are a three-dimensional planar structure: a pair of helicopter rotors (wings) mounted one above the other on concentric shafts, with the same axis of rotation (but turning in opposite directions).

In loudspeaker design, coaxial speakers are a loudspeaker system in which the individual drivers are mounted close to one another on the same axis, and thus radiate sound along the same axis and roughly from the same point.

A coaxial weapon mount places two weapons on roughly the same axis – as the weapons are usually side-by-side or one on top of the other, and thus oriented in parallel directions – they are technically par-axial rather than coaxial, however the distances involved mean that they are effectively coaxial as far as the operator is concerned.

<text>A protein complex or multiprotein complex is a group of two or more associated polypeptide chains. Protein complexes are distinct from multidomain enzymes, in which multiple catalytic domains are found in a single polypeptide chain.

Protein complexes are a form of quaternary structure. Proteins in a protein complex are linked by non-covalent protein–protein interactions. These complexes are a cornerstone of many (if not most) biological processes. The cell is seen to be composed of modular supramolecular complexes, each of which performs an independent, discrete biological function.

Through proximity, the speed and selectivity of binding interactions between enzymatic complex and substrates can be vastly improved, leading to higher cellular efficiency. Many of the techniques used to enter cells and isolate proteins are inherently disruptive to such large complexes, complicating the task of determining the components of a complex.

Examples of protein complexes include the proteasome for molecular degradation and most RNA polymerases. In stable complexes, large hydrophobic interfaces between proteins typically bury surface areas larger than 2500 square Ås.

== Function ==

Protein complex formation can activate or inhibit one or more of the complex members and in this way, protein complex formation can be similar to phosphorylation. Individual proteins can participate in a variety of protein complexes. Different complexes perform different functions, and the same complex can perform multiple functions depending on various factors. Factors include:

* Cell compartment location
* Cell cycle stage
* Cell nutritional status

Many protein complexes are well understood, particularly in the model organism &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (yeast). For this relatively simple organism, the study of protein complexes is now genome wide and the elucidation of most of its protein complexes is ongoing. In 2021, researchers used deep learning software RoseTTAFold along with AlphaFold to solve the structures of 712 eukaryote complexes. They compared 6000 yeast proteins to those from 2026 other fungi and 4325 other eukaryotes.

==Types of protein complexes==

=== Obligate vs non-obligate protein complex ===
If a protein can form a stable well-folded structure on its own (without any other associated protein) &quot;in vivo&quot;, then the complexes formed by such proteins are termed &quot;non-obligate protein complexes&quot;. However, some proteins can&#x27;t be found to create a stable well-folded structure alone, but can be found as a part of a protein complex which stabilizes the constituent proteins. Such protein complexes are called &quot;obligate protein complexes&quot;.

=== Transient vs permanent/stable protein complex ===
Transient protein complexes form and break down transiently &quot;in vivo&quot;, whereas permanent complexes have a relatively long half-life. Typically, the obligate interactions (protein–protein interactions in an obligate complex) are permanent, whereas non-obligate interactions have been found to be either permanent or transient. Note that there is no clear distinction between obligate and non-obligate interaction, rather there exist a continuum between them which depends on various conditions e.g. pH, protein concentration etc. However, there are important distinctions between the properties of transient and permanent/stable interactions: stable interactions are highly conserved but transient interactions are far less conserved, interacting proteins on the two sides of a stable interaction have more tendency of being co-expressed than those of a transient interaction (in fact, co-expression probability between two transiently interacting proteins is not higher than two random proteins), and transient interactions are much less co-localized than stable interactions. Though, transient by nature, transient interactions are very important for cell biology: the human interactome is enriched in such interactions, these interactions are the dominating players of gene regulation and signal transduction, and proteins with &quot;intrinsically disordered regions&quot; (IDR: regions in protein that show dynamic inter-converting structures in the native state) are found to be enriched in transient regulatory and signaling interactions.

=== Fuzzy complex ===
Fuzzy protein complexes have more than one structural form or dynamic structural disorder in the bound state. This means that proteins may not fold completely in either transient or permanent complexes. Consequently, specific complexes can have ambiguous interactions, which vary according to the environmental signals. Hence different ensembles of structures result in different (even opposite) biological functions. Post-translational modifications, protein interactions or alternative splicing modulate the conformational ensembles of fuzzy complexes, to fine-tune affinity or specificity of interactions. These mechanisms are often used for regulation within the eukaryotic transcription machinery.

== Essential proteins in protein complexes ==

Although some early studies suggested a strong correlation between essentiality and protein interaction degree (the &quot;centrality-lethality&quot; rule) subsequent analyses have shown that this correlation is weak for binary or transient interactions (e.g., yeast two-hybrid). However, the correlation is robust for networks of stable co-complex interactions. In fact, a disproportionate number of essential genes belong to protein complexes. This led to the conclusion that essentiality is a property of molecular machines (i.e. complexes) rather than individual components. Wang et al. (2009) noted that larger protein complexes are more likely to be essential, explaining why essential genes are more likely to have high co-complex interaction degree. Ryan et al. (2013) referred to the observation that entire complexes appear essential as &quot;modular essentiality&quot;. These authors also showed that complexes tend to be composed of either essential or non-essential proteins rather than showing a random distribution (see Figure). However, this not an all or nothing phenomenon: only about 26% (105/401) of yeast complexes consist of solely essential or solely nonessential subunits.

In humans, genes whose protein products belong to the same complex are more likely to result in the same disease phenotype.

==Homomultimeric and heteromultimeric proteins==
The subunits of a multimeric protein may be identical as in a homomultimeric (homooligomeric) protein or different as in a heteromultimeric protein. Many soluble and membrane proteins form homomultimeric complexes in a cell, majority of proteins in the Protein Data Bank are homomultimeric. Homooligomers are responsible for the diversity and specificity of many pathways, may mediate and regulate gene expression, activity of enzymes, ion channels, receptors, and cell adhesion processes.

The voltage-gated potassium channels in the plasma membrane of a neuron are heteromultimeric proteins composed of four of forty known alpha subunits. Subunits must be of the same subfamily to form the multimeric protein channel. The tertiary structure of the channel allows ions to flow through the hydrophobic plasma membrane. Connexons are an example of a homomultimeric protein composed of six identical connexins. A cluster of connexons forms the gap-junction in two neurons that transmit signals through an electrical synapse.

===Intragenic complementation===

When multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a gene form a complex, this protein structure is referred to as a multimer. When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone. In such a case, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation (also called inter-allelic complementation). Intragenic complementation has been demonstrated in many different genes in a variety of organisms including the fungi &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;, &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;; the bacterium &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot;; the virus bacteriophage T4, an RNA virus and humans. In such studies, numerous mutations defective in the same gene were often isolated and mapped in a linear order on the basis of recombination frequencies to form a genetic map of the gene. Separately, the mutants were tested in pairwise combinations to measure complementation. An analysis of the results from such studies led to the conclusion that intragenic complementation, in general, arises from the interaction of differently defective polypeptide monomers to form a multimer. Genes that encode multimer-forming polypeptides appear to be common. One interpretation of the data is that polypeptide monomers are often aligned in the multimer in such a way that mutant polypeptides defective at nearby sites in the genetic map tend to form a mixed multimer that functions poorly, whereas mutant polypeptides defective at distant sites tend to form a mixed multimer that functions more effectively. The intermolecular forces likely responsible for self-recognition and multimer formation were discussed by Jehle.

== Structure determination ==

The molecular structure of protein complexes can be determined by experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography, Single particle analysis or nuclear magnetic resonance. Increasingly the theoretical option of protein–protein docking is also becoming available. One method that is commonly used for identifying the meomplexes is immunoprecipitation. Recently, Raicu and coworkers developed a method to determine the quaternary structure of protein complexes in living cells. This method is based on the determination of pixel-level Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency in conjunction with spectrally resolved two-photon microscope. The distribution of FRET efficiencies are simulated against different models to get the geometry and stoichiometry of the complexes.

==Assembly==

Proper assembly of multiprotein complexes is important, since misassembly can lead to disastrous consequences. In order to study pathway assembly, researchers look at intermediate steps in the pathway. One such technique that allows one to do that is electrospray mass spectrometry, which can identify different intermediate states simultaneously. This has led to the discovery that most complexes follow an ordered assembly pathway. In the cases where disordered assembly is possible, the change from an ordered to a disordered state leads to a transition from function to dysfunction of the complex, since disordered assembly leads to aggregation.

The structure of proteins play a role in how the multiprotein complex assembles. The interfaces between proteins can be used to predict assembly pathways. The intrinsic flexibility of proteins also plays a role: more flexible proteins allow for a greater surface area available for interaction.

While assembly is a different process from disassembly, the two are reversible in both homomeric and heteromeric complexes. Thus, the overall process can be referred to as (dis)assembly.

===Evolutionary significance of multiprotein complex assembly===
In homomultimeric complexes, the homomeric proteins assemble in a way that mimics evolution. That is, an intermediate in the assembly process is present in the complex&#x27;s evolutionary history.
The opposite phenomenon is observed in heteromultimeric complexes, where gene fusion occurs in a manner that preserves the original assembly pathway.

<text>Cork Institute of Technology (CIT; ) was an institute of technology, located in Cork, Ireland. Upon its dissolution, the institute had 17,000 students studying in art, business, engineering, music, drama and science disciplines. The institute had been named as Institute of Technology of the Year in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; University Guide for Ireland on numerous occasions. On 1 January 2021, the institute merged with the Institute of Technology, Tralee to become the Munster Technological University, Ireland&#x27;s second technological university.

Cork Institute of Technology consisted of two constituent faculties and three constituent colleges. The constituent faculties were Engineering and Science, and Business and Humanities. The constituent colleges were the CIT Crawford College of Art and Design, the CIT Cork School of Music and the National Maritime College of Ireland. Faculties were made up of Schools which in turn comprise two or more academic departments.

As of May 2020, CIT had 1,465 staff members of whom 862 were academic staff.

== History ==
Cork Institute of Technology, and its predecessor Cork RTC, developed from earlier institutions such as the Royal Cork Institution which existed from 1807 until 1861, and the Crawford Municipal Technical Institute which was founded in 1912, which trained students in Science and Engineering. In 1930 the City of Cork Vocational Education Committee was set up. Cork Regional Technical College was established in 1974 and the Crawford Institute was merged with the new Cork RTC in 1976.

Following enactment of the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992, it incorporated the Cork School of Music and the Crawford College of Art and Design on 1 January 1993. In late 1997 it was renamed from Regional Technical College, Cork, to Cork Institute of Technology.

James P. (Jim) Roche who was head of Crawford, became the first principal of Cork RTC. Dr. Patrick Kelleher became principal of the RTC in 1988, and the director of Cork IT until 2004. In 2007 the title of the head of the institute changed from &quot;Director&quot; to &quot;President&quot;. Dr. Brendan J. Murphy was director/president from 2004 until retiring in 2017. He was succeeded by Dr. Barry O&#x27;Connor.

In March 2008, it was announced that CIT was applying for university status. On 1 January 2021, the institute merged with the Institute of Technology, Tralee to become the Munster Technological University, Ireland&#x27;s second technological university.

==Staff==
The institute&#x27;s 2020 staff complement was 1,465, 862 being academic staff. The academic staff consisted of 473 permanent whole-time, 156 pro-rata part-time and 233 hourly-paid part-time members. The non-academic staff was composed of technical support, library, administrative and services staff. The non-academic staff members broke down as follows: 131 management, clerical, administrative and library; 177 student services, including examination invigilators; 82 technicians; 67 research staff; and 96 support staff including caretakers, attendants and cleaners.

== Research ==
Research was a core dimension of CIT activity. This is underlined by the fact that, after Dublin Institute of Technology, CIT has the most extensive delegated authority to award PhDs. In collaboration with a wide range of organisations including Higher Education Institutions, Industry, State and Voluntary Bodies, CIT is involved in research that contributes to supporting:
* Regional and National Industry.
* The National and EU knowledge economy and Innovation Base.
* Enhanced quality of life within Irish society.
* Quality research postgraduate education at Masters and PhD level.
* Quality undergraduate and taught postgraduate teaching and learning.

The main Institute research activity was primarily, though not exclusively, organised around three Strategic Research Clusters that reflect the CIT current dominant strategic research strengths and critical mass. There are also new and emerging areas of research and a number of long established centres that engage in research and consultancy. Across the Institute faculties and constituent colleges, academic staff research interests range across Engineering, Science, Business and Humanities, Music and Art. The CIT Research mission is to continue to build on niche strengths and to develop sustainable and productive research, innovation, technology transfer and postgraduate education across all its faculties.

CIT hosted the 2011 Collaborative European Research Conference at its Blackrock Castle Observatory.

=== NIMBUS Centre ===
On 17 January 2010, CIT took possession of the new NIMBUS Centre for Embedded Systems Research and, on 16 March 2010, 65 researchers and students relocated from diverse locations in CIT to the NIMBUS building.

Funded through the HEA Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) in 2007, NIMBUS was the first building nationally to be completed in the 4th cycle of PRTLI funding and reflects collaboration and project management by the CIT Development Office, the architects RKD, building contractors Walls and the team of researchers for whom the building was designed.

A research centre at the NIMBUS Centre is adjacent to and attached to the Rubicon Centre and its extension. The NIMBUS Centre provides space for up to 80 researchers, including facilities for undergraduate project students, visiting postgraduate students and researchers from other institutions and dedicated industry visitor workstations, where company researchers can work in collaboration with NIMBUS staff and use NIMBUS research facilities. A large area of the ground floor is given over to an open-plan laboratory space.

== Academic alliances ==
CIT holds a partnership with the Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences (h_da), Germany. CIT&#x27;s BA in Multimedia offers a joint accreditation from CIT and h_da.

CIT offer a number of degree courses in conjunction with University College Cork, including their BSc in Architecture and BSc in Biomedical Science.

The CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory runs a programme in partnership with the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center in Oakland, California.

CIT has also established various industrial alliances, particularly with Dell EMC and VMware, both of which have a business presence in Cork. The college also maintains close ties with Cisco Systems and the Cisco Networking Academy. CIT is itself both an official VMware and Cisco academy, as well as a Microsoft, Novell and ITIL academy.

== Incubation and innovation programmes ==
=== Rubicon Centre ===
The Rubicon Centre is a business incubation centre and is located on campus at CIT. Home to over 40 knowledge-based start-up companies, the centre is jointly financed by CIT &amp; Enterprise Ireland. Clients based at the Rubicon are at different stages of development, from concept stage to completing their first customer orders. In 2007, a second incubation facility was opened to accommodate the demand for on-campus incubation space. An extension to the existing building was due to be operational by June 2010.

The centre&#x27;s role as an incubator is to assist the formation and growth of early stage, knowledge intensive businesses, by providing physical space, in-house management support, access to advice and support from Institute resources.

=== Genesis Programme ===
The Genesis Enterprise Programme is based at CIT&#x27;s Rubicon Centre, offering participants the opportunity to avail of a 12-month rapid incubation programme that aims to support and accelerate graduate entrepreneurs in developing their business from a very early stage. It has been in operation since 1998. The programme supports entrepreneurs (for &quot;knowledge based&quot; fields &quot;with export potential&quot; such as Food, Information Technology, Biotech, Telecommunications, Renewable Energy, Medical Device and Automotive) in the South West region. It is supported by the Department of Education and Science, with participant support from Enterprise Ireland.

The programme is a full-time programme for graduates and is supported by University College Cork, Enterprise Ireland, Cork&#x27;s County and City Enterprise Boards, Údarás Na Gaeltachta, and Cork BIC.

=== Innovation prize ===
Run in association with the Cork Enterprise Board, the &#x27;CIT Prize for Innovation&#x27; awards those whose inventions and business ideas are judged &quot;most creative, novel, innovative, and likely to succeed in the marketplace&quot;. The prize is open to all departments and entrants may use a project that form part of their coursework for the year. Entrants must be full-time or part-time students (including postgraduate students) at CIT during the current academic year. The awards are accompanied by a series of cash prizes, and in 2010 a prize fund of €10,000 was allocated.

== Main campus ==

The main campus of some eighty acres is situated in Bishopstown, in the western suburbs of Cork city. It is equipped with theatres, lecture rooms, laboratories, drawing studios, a library, computer suites, open access computing centre and research units. Recreational facilities for students include a running track, tennis courts, all-weather pitch, a gymnasium and grass playing pitches. A new indoor swimming pool is located immediately adjacent to the institute. The campus holds a mixture of concrete panelled buildings and extensive modern brick architecture.

CIT&#x27;s main campus has won awards for its architectural design and aesthetics.

== Constituents ==
CIT has a number of constituent colleges and facilities. These are located off its main campus, and include the CIT Cork School of Music, CIT Crawford College of Art and Design, National Maritime College of Ireland and CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory.

=== CIT Cork School of Music ===

The CIT Cork School of Music is located in the centre of Cork City. The college was founded in 1878 and became a school of Cork Institute of Technology in 1993. The school operates primarily from a five-floor purpose-built conservatory which was built on the site of an earlier premises. It opened on Union Quay in 2007 and was designed by Murray O&#x27;Laoire and Buro Happold.

With over three thousand enrolments, CIT Cork School of Music offers conservatory music and drama courses, from pre-school kindermusic classes, part-time instrumental, vocal and drama lessons, life-long-learning classes and performance ensembles to its full-time degree courses at bachelors, masters and doctoral level. Four hundred third-level students study on the four-year BMus, BA in Popular Music, BA in Musical Theatre, and BA in Theatre &amp; Drama Studies; Masters in Performance and Music Technology; and PhD programmes.

Cork School of Music&#x27;s Union Quay building hosts sixty Steinway pianos. The acoustics were provided by Applied Acoustic Design. The building incorporates three performance spaces, the Curtis Auditorium, Stack &quot;Black Box&quot; Theatre and the main Atrium which also functions as an art gallery. The building has a recording suite, six lecture theatres, the Fleischmann Library, two audio labs, an I.T. lab, over 50 teaching and practice studios, 5 medium-sized classrooms, 5 full sized classrooms each acoustically isolated to also act as practice rooms. Under the same roof is the Off-Quay restaurant, and a common room for full-time students with large open plan areas on all floors.

=== CIT Crawford College of Art and Design ===

The CIT Crawford College of Art &amp; Design is a constituent college of Cork Institute of Technology. The CIT Crawford College offers full-time courses to bachelor&#x27;s degree, Masters and Higher Diploma levels, all validated by CIT and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC).

The college is sited in its own campus in Sharman Crawford Street, approximately four miles from the main CIT campus in Bishopstown. The Crawford College of Art &amp; Design is located near the primary art centres and schools in Cork.

CIT&#x27;s Department of Fine Art and the Department of Art &amp; Design Education are based at the Sharman Crawford Street campus, offering programmes in Fine Art, Ceramics and Art Education. CIT&#x27;s Department of Media Communications became part of the Crawford College in January 2010. However, both the Department of Media Communications and the Department of Art Therapy are based at the college&#x27;s Bishopstown campus.

Facilities at the Sharman Crawford Street campus include studios with personal work spaces for all students, and well-equipped workshops including ceramics, metal and wood fabrication, stone carving, foundry, photography, film and video, digital media, etching, lithography, silk screen and relief printmaking, textiles and stained glass. The library houses over 12,000 volumes, 45 periodicals and newspapers, and over 30,000 slides.

The CIT Crawford College of Art and Design has its origins in the Cork School of Design of 1850, which was associated with the Royal Cork Institution. The building that originally housed the college was built in 1724 as Cork&#x27;s Custom House. In 1979 the college was transferred to its current location on Sharman Crawford Street, near Saint Fin Barre&#x27;s Cathedral. The Crawford College of Art and Design has close ties to the Crawford Art Gallery, which is located in the college&#x27;s former building. The Crawford Art Gallery houses John Butt&#x27;s View of Cork, which was painted circa 1755, and shows the influence of Dutch trade on the early architecture of Cork.

Irish landscape painter James Brenan (RHA) was headmaster of the school from 1860 to 1889. It was he who influenced William Horatio Crawford, from the famous brewing family, to invest in the School, leading to the 1884 extension and subsequent renaming of the school to the Crawford Municipal School of Art. Under the Institutes of Technology Act 2006, the Crawford College of Art and Design became a designated school of the Cork Institute of Technology.

Principals of Crawford includes James Brenan, William Mulligan, Hugh Charde (1919-1937), John F. King, Jim Barry, Teddy Murphy and Jim Roche who was appointed in 1968, and went on to be the first principal of Cork RTC.

=== National Maritime College of Ireland ===
The National Maritime College of Ireland (NMCI) is a joint project between the Cork Institute of Technology and the Irish Naval Service.The joint delivery of programmes with the Defence Forces in Leadership, Management, Engineering and Computing up to and including Masters level. It is located in Ringaskiddy, County Cork, Ireland. The college provides a range of maritime qualifications, including at academic degree level, and its facilities can accommodate 750 students.

The college cost approximately €50 million when opened in October 2004 and was one of the first public private partnership type projects in education in the Republic of Ireland.

The college facilities include systems for training deck department personnel, including several bridge simulators, such as a 360-degree model and a 270-degree model. Workshops are provided for ropework and other deck associated skills, and simulators are provided for GMDSS training and cargo work. Engine department trainees avail of a fully functional engine room, which includes diesel engines, oil purifiers, air compressors, sewage treatment plant, fresh water generators and other equipment found on board oceangoing vessels. An engine room simulator is used to train personnel in watchkeeping, teamwork and process management. Common facilities include the survival training pool, helicopter dunker, lifeboats and firefighting training facility. Machine workshops are utilised to train engineers in turning, milling, grinding, welding and the use of hand tools for fabrication. There is a marine library on site, but with limited access.

In September 2006, King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway visited the NMCI, while on a state visit to Ireland, to promote maritime links between Cork and Oslo.

=== CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory ===

Blackrock Castle was originally built on the River Lee in 1582 by the citizens of Cork as a watch tower and fort, assuring trade ships of a safe haven, the Elizabethan government of the era ordering a round tower constructed to protect against marauding pirates and other invaders. Following a charter by James I in 1608, Blackrock Castle was handed over to the City of Cork. In 1722 the old tower was destroyed by fire and was rebuilt with an octagonal room topped with a cupola. The castle was used at this time as the Corporation banquet hall. In 1827 the castle was again destroyed by fire, before being rebuilt a year later, three additional storeys and out-buildings being added at that time. In 2002 the castle underwent an extensive refurbishment programme, and in August 2007, Blackrock Castle was re-opened to the public as the CIT Blackrock Castle Observatory.

&quot;Cosmos at the Castle&quot; is an interactive astronomy exhibit that takes place at the observatory, featuring four cinema sized screens that share information with visitors on the Big Bang, the evolution of life on Earth, and the existence of extraterrestrial life in the Universe.

The observatory also houses a team of astronomical researchers and scientists from CIT, most of which are engaged in the development of new technologies designed for searching for planets around distant stars, a project known as the Planet Search Programme. Most of the researchers come from the Astronomy and Instrumentation Group, based within the Department of Applied Physics and Instrumentation at CIT.

The observatory features a rooftop 16&quot; Meade reflector telescope. A monthly remote astronomy schools project is run at the observatory. The project is entitled Web of Stars, and is run in conjunction with the Chabot Space &amp; Science Center in Oakland, California.

CIT is the Irish partner in the Comenius funded European Union Hands on Universe project. This project trains teachers to use real astronomy data in the classroom to support the teaching of science and mathematics.

The castle hosted the 2011 Collaborative European Research Conference. In May 2011, a partnership between CIT and the National Space Centre was announced. The partnership saw the 32-metre satellite dish at Elfordstown Earthstation in Midleton, Co Cork, start a new life as a Deep Space Radio Telescope. The Deep Space Radio Telescope will be capable of detecting a host of cosmic phenomena. The dish was originally constructed in 1984 to take transatlantic telephone calls from Europe to the US, and was retired from use in the mid-1990s when the underground transatlantic cables were laid.

== Sport ==
The college has several full-size pitches, some of which are floodlit, catering to field sports, including Gaelic games, soccer and Gaelic games. The college&#x27;s primary hurling and Gaelic football pitch, located on campus, offers its own stadium. CIT&#x27;s athletics track is now one of the finest in the country, and also enjoys its own purpose-built stadium. In addition to its 9 playing pitches, two stadia and international standard athletics track, CIT also boasts on campus all-weather astroturf pitches, tennis courts and a sports hall. CIT offers students free membership to its small gym and weights room. LeisureWorld, one of Cork&#x27;s fitness and health facilities, is adjacent the campus, and offers special membership rates to CIT students and staff.

CIT&#x27;s sports grounds play host to competitions throughout the year, including schools matches in Gaelic football, hurling, soccer and rugby. In the past, CIT has hosted the Avonmore Milk Munster Youth&#x27;s Cup Rugby semi-finals, Simcox, Coirn Uí Mhuirí and various other competitions. The college&#x27;s facilities also cater to the training needs of various local and inter-county teams, including the Cork Ladies Football teams from underage to senior level, Cork Senior and Minor Camogies and the Cork Minor and Under-21 Hurlers. CIT is also the home ground for the Cork Admirals Flag Football games.

In 2009 CIT won the Sigerson Cup, the premier Gaelic football competition in Ireland for the first time, beating Dublin Institute of Technology by 5 points in the final. CIT enjoys a local rivalry with University College Cork.

Other sports offered by the college include martial arts such as aikido, judo, karate, kickboxing and taekwondo. In addition to Gaelic games, soccer and rugby, CIT has teams involved in field sports such as flag football and hockey. Canoeing, rowing, sailing, sub aqua, surfing, and swimming make up the college&#x27;s range of water sports, while many students also participate and compete in indoor sports such as aerobics, badminton, basketball, boxing, gymnastics, trampoling, pool, racquetball, table tennis and volleyball. Various other sports played at CIT include athletics, cycling, equestrian, golf, motorsport, mountaineering, rock-climbing, mountain biking, orienteering and tennis.

CIT annually awards sports bursaries to a wide range of sports for both senior and first-year students.

CIT&#x27;s Sports Office oversees the college&#x27;s sporting participation and facilities. The Office facilitates students and their clubs and is responsible for the management and upkeep of all sports facilities in the institute.

==Munster Technological University==

In May 2020, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the formal approval of Munster Technological university, to begin operations in January 2021.

The proposal had been building for 3 years. The University would offer a multi-campus institution spanning across Cork and Kerry, creating a second University in the region, and third in the province of Munster. A formal application for T.U. status was lodged in February 2019.

In May 2019, academic staff of C.I.T. and I.T. Tralee rejected the merger, and an international advisory panel visited the campuses.

<doc id="542616" wikidata="Q27776" url="?curid=542616" title="Adyghe language">
<text>Adyghe ( or ; also known as West Circassian) is a Northwest Caucasian language spoken by the western subgroups of Circassians. It is spoken mainly in Russia, as well as in Turkey, Jordan, Syria and Israel, where Circassians settled after the Circassian genocide (–1870) by the Russian Empire. It is closely related to the Kabardian (East Circassian) language, though some reject the distinction between the two languages in favor of both being dialects of a unitary Circassian language.

The literary standard of Adyghe is based on its Temirgoy dialect. Adyghe and Russian are the two official languages of the Republic of Adygea in the Russian Federation.

In Russia, there are around 128,000 speakers of Adyghe, almost all of them native speakers. In total, some 300,000 speak it worldwide. The largest Adyghe-speaking community is in Turkey, spoken by the diaspora from the Russian–Circassian War (–1864). In addition, the Adyghe language is spoken by the Cherkesogai in Krasnodar Krai.

Adyghe belongs to the family of Northwest Caucasian languages. Kabardian (also known as East Circassian) is a very close relative, treated by some as a dialect of Adyghe or of an overarching Circassian language. Ubykh, Abkhaz and Abaza are somewhat more distantly related to Adyghe.

== Dialects ==
=== The Black Sea coast dialects ===
*Shapsug dialect ()
**North Shapsugs, Great Shapsugs, Kuban Shapsugs () dialect
***Kfar Kama dialect ()
**Temirgoy-Shapsugs, Pseuşko accent ()
**South Shapsugs, Small Shapsugs, Coastal Shapsugs, Black Sea Shapsugs () dialect
**Hakuchi dialect ()
*Natukhai dialect ()
*Zhaney dialect

=== The Kuban River dialects ===
*Bzhedug dialect (): spoken by Circassians in the Republic of Adygea and the Biga district of the city of Çanakkale in Turkey
*Temirgoy (): literary standard of Adyghe. Also spoken by Circassians in the Republic of Adygea
*Abzakh dialect (): spoken by Circassians in the village of Rehaniya in Israel and Circassians in Syria from the Golan Heights
*Mamkhegh dialect
*Yegeruqay dialect
*Hatuqwai dialect
*Mequash dialect

== Phonology ==

Adyghe exhibits between 50 and 60 consonants depending on the dialect. All dialects possess a contrast between plain and labialized glottal stops. A very unusual minimal contrast, and possibly unique to the Abzakh dialect of Adyghe, is a three-way contrast between plain, labialized and palatalized glottal stops (although a palatalized glottal stop is also found in Hausa and a labialized one in Tlingit). The Shapsug (Black Sea) dialect of Adyghe contains a very uncommon sound: a voiceless bidental fricative , which corresponds to the voiceless velar fricative found in other varieties of Adyghe. This sound is only known to be used in the Black Sea dialect.

# These consonants exist only in borrowed words.
# Note: Adyghe has many consonants that appear across its dialects, and thus has a complex system of consonant allophony. More information on those can be found at Adyghe phonology.

In contrast to its large inventory of consonants, Adyghe has only three phonemic vowels in a vertical vowel system.

== Grammar ==

Adyghe, like all Northwest Caucasian languages, has a basic subject–object–verb typology and is characterised by the ergative construction of sentences.

== Orthography ==
The official alphabet for Adyghe is the Cyrillic script, which has been used since 1936. Before that, the Perso-Arabic script was used. A new Latin alphabet based on the Turkish alphabet is designed in Turkey with the motivation to make Adyghe and Kabardian education in Turkey easier.

=== Orthography rules ===
* The letter is not written after a , or a labialised consonant. For example: унэ &quot;house&quot; instead of уынэ.
* In case the letter is the first letter of a word or when it is not related to any other consonant, it is pronounced as . For example: унэ instead of уынэ. When it is related to a consonant, it becomes a vowel and pronounced as . For example: чэту &quot;cat&quot; instead of чэтыу.
* In case a labialised consonant is followed by a vowel , instead of the letter there is a . For example: гъогу &quot;road&quot; instead of гъуэгу.
* In case a labialised consonant is followed by a vowel or , the labialised consonant letter is written fully. For example: цуакъэ &quot;shoes&quot;.
* In case the letter is the first letter of a word or when it is not related to any other consonant, it is pronounced as [wɐ] . For example, о &quot;you&quot; instead of уэ.
* In case the letter is the first letter of a word or when it is not related to any other consonant, it is pronounced as . For example: еӏо &quot;he says&quot; instead of йэӏо. When it is related to a consonant, it becomes a vowel and pronounced as . For example: делэ &quot;fool&quot; instead of дэйлэ.
* In case the letter is the first letter of a word or when is not related to any other consonant, it is pronounced as . For example: илъэс &quot;year&quot; instead of йылъэс. When it is related to a consonant, it becomes a vowel and pronounced as . For example: сиӏ &quot;I have&quot; instead of сыйӏ.

=== Vowels ===
The vowels are written , and . Other letters represent diphthongs: represents , or , or , represent or , and represents or .

=== Other writing systems ===
The language of Adyghe is officially written in the Cyrillic script, and is also unofficially written in the Latin script. Before 1927, Adyghe was written in a version of the Perso-Arabic script; after the Soviet Latinisation campaign, an older variant of the Latin alphabet had been in use in the Soviet Union until 1938, when all Soviet languages transitioned into the Cyrillic alphabet.

Prior to the mid-19th century, Adyghe had no writing system. Starting from 1853, the process of creating an orthography for Adyghe was started. In Tbilisi in 1853, a document titled &quot;Primer of the Circassian Language&quot; (Archive) was published, in which an Perso-Arabic-based orthography influenced by the Ottoman Turkish alphabet was developed. This document became the first ever publication in Adyghe. In this document, several new letters were introduced to represent the consonants that exist in Adyghe language. This proposed orthography, although with many shortcomings, received widespread approval and usage. And thus, Perso-Arabic script became the accepted orthography for Adyghe.

Over the following decades, several authors attempted to further improve the Adyghe Arabic orthography. The most successful attempt was the alphabet created by Akhmetov Bekukh. In this version, letters were designated for vowel sounds, and the orthography was transformed from an &quot;Impure abjads to a true alphabet. In 1918, on the initiative of the Kuban Revolutionary Committee, a primer was published in Yekaterinodar. This official endorsement resulted in a literary boom in Adyghe and the publication of various newspapers, textbooks and other literature, including the &quot;Adyghe Maq&quot;, the main Adyghe language newspaper established in 1923.

During the abovementioned decades, parallel with this process, the Perso-Arabic orthography had also been standardized for the sister Circassian language of Kabardian. Although very similar in many aspects, there were minor variations, in which letters were included based on each respective phonology, and there were minor differences in presentation of a few consonants as well.

====Adyghe Arabic alphabet====
Below table shows the Adyghe Perso-Arabic alphabet as it was officially adopted between 1918 and 1927.

====Adyghe Latin alphabet====
The Adyghe orthography was officially switched to the Latin alphabet in 1927. The Adyghe Latin alphabet was compiled and finalized a year prior, in 1926. This alphabet was the sole official script in the Soviet Union. The Adyghe Latin alphabet consisted of 50 letters, many of them newly created, some even borrowed from Cyrillic. Another interesting feature of this iteration of the Adyghe Latin alphabet was that there was no distinction between lower case and upper case letters. Each letter only had one single case.

Below table shows Adyghe Latin alphabet as it was officially adopted between 1927 and 1938.

==== Latin Alphabet in Turkey (ABX Alphabet) ====
In 2012, the Circassian Language Association ( or Adıǵe Bze Xase, abbreviated as ABX; ; danef.com) in Turkey has issued a call for the Circassian people for the creation of a standard Latin script to be used by all Circassian people on the globe. Their main motivation for the creation of this alphabet was that the majority of Circassian people live in Turkey and use the Latin alphabet in their daily life because they know Turkish. However, when trying to teach the language to the younger generation, teaching them a new alphabet takes time and makes the process more laborsome. ABX has created a Latin script based on the Turkish alphabet and chose the Abzakh dialect as their base because it is the dialect with the most speakers in Turkey. However, the alphabet employed by the Circassian Language Association has been criticized by others. Some suggested that they created the alphabet without a good understanding of the Circassian phonology and have not even considered former Latin alphabets used to write Circassian and that the use of the Latin script would sever the ties with the homeland. Despite the criticism, the CLA has obtained a €40,000 funding from the European Union for the recording of the Circassian language with a Latin script and the preparation of multi-media learning materials for the language, and the materials created by ABX were accepted by the Ministry of National Education to be taught in Secondary Schools. This decision was protested and legally objected by the Federation of Caucasian Associations (; KAFFED) who created the materials for Circassian and Abaza languages with the Cyrillic script; however, the court ruled in favour of the Latin alphabet created by the CLA and continued the use of their alphabet in Circassian courses. Some glyphs in the Temirgoy-based Cyrillic alphabet have no equivalent in the Abzakh-based Latin alphabet because of dialectal differences. The most notable of these differences is the lack of differentiation between post-alveolar, alveolo-palatal and retroflex sounds. Though there are some additional letters in the alphabet for Kabardian, the materials in the CLA website are primarily in Adyghe.

1) Ć is the equivalent of both Кӏ and Чӏ and shows the ejective potalveolar affricate. Qq, on the other hand, only corresponds to Кӏ and shows an ejective velar plosive.

2) Ç normally stands for Ч but when it is followed by Ü and Ö, it is equivalent to Цу in the Cyrillic script.

3) É and İ are not direct equivalents of Е and И. The Cyrillic letters denote the [jɜ] and [jə] sounds at the beginning of syllables and [e] and [i] sounds at the end. The Latin letters are only used for the sounds [e] and [i]. The diphthongs are written as &quot;Ye&quot; and &quot;Yi&quot;, respectively.

4) Circassian languages do not have phonemic rounded vowels but the labialized consonants affect the vowels around them to create allophonic rounded vowels. The letters O, Ö, U and Ü are used to show these allophonic rounded vowels. O/Ö and U/Ü works similar to the vowel use О and У in the Adyghe Cyrillic alphabet with O/Ö showing labialized consonant+[ɜ] combinations and U/Ü the labialized consonant+[ə] combinations. However, Ö and Ü are used when these combinations occur next to postalveolar sounds (Ş, J, Ç). The diphthongal uses of О and У, i.e. [wɜ] and [wə], are written as &quot;We&quot; and &quot;Wı&quot;. Another use of Ö and Ü is writing Turkish loanwords containing these letters.

5) Wıçüpe (уцупэ; the place of stopping) is written with a ` (accent grave) or &#x27; (apostrophe) and has a complicated use. It is equivalent to Ӏ (palochka) in its use an ejective marker but not as the glottal stop. The glottal stop is not written as a letter but is implied through the use of consecutive vowels like in &quot;mıerıs&quot; (мыӀэрыс; apple). As many ejective sounds have their own letters (Ć, Ṕ, Q, Š, Ṫ), only some ejective sounds are written with the wıçüpe (ş`, ĺ`). Another use of wıçüpe is to show that an U at the end of a word represents a labialized consonant and not a labialized consonant + [ə] combination. For example, джэгу in Cyrillic is written cegu` to make sure that it is pronounced [d͡ʒɜgʷ] as a single syllable but wıçüpe is removed when the word takes a suffix and the allophonic [u] is audible, as in cegum [d͡ʒɜgum]. 

== Examples of literary Adyghe ==
=== Native vocabulary ===
=== Loanwords ===
* There are thirteen labialised consonants; however, in some dialects, there are three additional ones: , and .

== Adyghe outside Circassia ==
Adyghe is taught outside Circassia in Prince Hamza Ibn Al-Hussein Secondary School, a school for Jordanian Adyghes in Jordan&#x27;s capital city of Amman. This school, established by the Jordanian Adyghes with support from the late king Hussein of Jordan, is one of the first schools for the Adyghe communities outside Circassia. It has around 750 Jordanian Adyghe students, and aims to preserve the Adyghe language and traditions among future generations.

Adyghe is spoken by Circassians in Iraq and by Circassians in Israel, where it is taught in schools in their villages. It is also spoken by many Circassians in Syria, although the majority of Syrian Circassians speak Kabardian.

== Publications ==
There are many books written in or translated into Adyghe. An Adyghe translation of the Quran by Ishak Mashbash is available. The New Testament and many books of the Old Testament have been published in Adyghe by the Institute for Bible Translation in Moscow.

== Vitality ==
According to the UNESCO 2009 map entitled &quot;UNESCO Map of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot;, the status of the Adyghe language in 2009, along with all its dialects (Adyghe, Western Circassian tribes; and Kabard-Cherkess, Eastern Circassian tribes), is classified as vulnerable.

<doc id="542645" wikidata="Q207466" url="?curid=542645" title="Amylose">
<text>Amylose is a polysaccharide made of α--glucose units, bonded to each other through α(1→4) glycosidic bonds. It is one of the two components of starch, making up approximately 20–25% of it. Because of its tightly packed helical structure, amylose is more resistant to digestion than other starch molecules and is therefore an important form of resistant starch.

==Structure==

Amylose is made up of α(1→4) bound glucose molecules. The carbon atoms on glucose are numbered, starting at the aldehyde (C=O) carbon, so, in amylose, the 1-carbon on one glucose molecule is linked to the 4-carbon on the next glucose molecule (α(1→4) bonds). The structural formula of amylose is pictured at right. The number of repeated glucose subunits (n) is usually in the range of 300 to 3000, but can be many thousands.

There are three main forms of amylose chains can take. It can exist in a disordered amorphous conformation or two different helical forms. It can bind with itself in a double helix (A or B form), or it can bind with another hydrophobic guest molecule such as iodine, a fatty acid, or an aromatic compound. This is known as the V form and is how amylopectin binds to amylose in the structure of starch. Within this group, there are many different variations. Each is notated with V and then a subscript indicating the number of glucose units per turn. The most common is the V6 form, which has six glucose units a turn. V8 and possibly V7 forms exist as well. These provide an even larger space for the guest molecule to bind.

This linear structure can have some rotation around the phi and psi angles, but for the most part bound glucose ring oxygens lie on one side of the structure. The α(1→4) structure promotes the formation of a helix structure, making it possible for hydrogen bonds to form between the oxygen atoms bound at the 2-carbon of one glucose molecule and the 3-carbon of the next glucose molecule.

Fiber X-ray diffraction analysis coupled with computer-based structure refinement has found A-, B-, and C- polymorphs of amylose. Each form corresponds to either the A-, the B-, or the C- starch forms. A- and B- structures have different helical crystal structures and water contents, whereas the C- structure is a mixture of A- and B- unit cells, resulting in an intermediate packing density between the two forms.

==Physical properties==
Because the long linear chains of amylose more readily crystallize than amylopectin (which has short, highly branched chains), high-amylose starch is more resistant to digestion. Unlike amylopectin, amylose is insoluble in water. It also reduces the crystallinity of amylopectin and how easily water can infiltrate the starch. The higher the amylose content, the less expansion potential and the lower the gel strength for the same starch concentration. This can be countered partially by increasing the granule size.

==Function==
Amylose is important in plant energy storage. It is less readily digested than amylopectin; however, because of its helical structure, it takes up less space than amylopectin. As a result, it is the preferred starch for storage in plants. It makes up about 30% of the stored starch in plants, though the percentage varies by species and variety.

The digestive enzyme α-amylase breaks down starch molecules into maltotriose and maltose, which can be used as sources of energy.

Amylose is also an important thickener, water binder, emulsion stabilizer, and gelling agent in industrial and food-based contexts. Loose helical amylose chains have a hydrophobic interior that can bind to hydrophobic molecules such as lipids and aromatic compounds. The one problem with this is that, when it crystallizes or associates, it can lose some stability, often releasing water in the process (syneresis). When amylose concentration is increased, gel stickiness decreases but firmness increases. When other things, including amylopectin, bind to amylose, the viscosity can be affected, but incorporating κ-carrageenan, alginate, xanthan gum, or low-molecular-weight sugars can reduce the loss in stability. The ability to bind water can add substance to food, possibly serving as a fat replacement. For example, amylose is responsible for causing white sauce to thicken, but, upon cooling, the solid and the water will partly separate. Amylose is known for its good film-forming properties, useful in food packaging. Excellent film-forming behavior of amylose was studied already in 1950s. Amylose films are better for both barrier properties and mechanical properties when compared to the amylopectin films.

In a laboratory setting, it can act as a marker. Iodine molecules fit neatly inside the helical structure of amylose, binding with the starch polymer that absorbs certain known wavelengths of light. Hence, a common test is the iodine test for starch. If starch is mixed with a small amount of yellow iodine solution, a blue-black color will be observed. The intensity of the color can be tested with a colorimeter, using a red filter to discern the concentration of starch present in the solution. It is also possible to use starch as an indicator in titrations involving iodine reduction. It is also used in amylose magnetic beads and resin to separate maltose-binding protein.

==Recent studies==
High-amylose varieties of rice, the less sticky long-grain rice, have a much lower glycemic load, which could be beneficial for diabetics.

Researchers have identified the Granule Bound Starch Synthase (GBSS) as the enzyme that specifically elongates amylose during starch biosynthesis in plants. The waxy locus in maize encodes for the GBSS protein. Mutants lacking the GBSS protein produce starch containing only amylopectin, such as in waxy corn. In Arabidopsis leaves, another gene, encoding the Protein Targeting to STarch (PTST) protein, is required in addition to GBSS for amylose synthesis. Mutants lacking either protein produce starch without amylose. Genetically modified potato cultivar Amflora by BASF Plant Science was developed to not produce amylose.

<text>Visconte Maggiolo (1478 – after 1549), also spelled &quot;Maiollo&quot; and &quot;Maiolo&quot;, was a Genoese cartographer.

He was born in Genoa and maybe he was a fellow sailor of explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano. In 1511 he moved to Naples, where he produced three extant nautical atlases. Some historians say that he died of malaria in 1530; but archival documents show that he was still alive, in Genoa, at least in 1549, although he certainly was already dead in 1561.

In 1527, he created a map depicting Verrazzano&#x27;s travels. This map had a major error (the eponymous &quot;Verrazzano Sea&quot; and &quot;Verrazzano Isthmus&quot;, which depicted a large sea, believed to be the Pacific Ocean, across a narrow isthmus on the eastern coast of North America) as Verrazzano did not accurately describe the North American continent. This error continued to show up in maps for over a century. A copy of this 1527 map was destroyed during World War II.

There are numerous portolan charts, atlases and at least two other world maps made by Vesconte Maggiolo: one dated Genoa, 1531; another kept at a public library in Treviso (in Italian), is dated Genoa, 1549.

Although he specialized in the mapping of the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea, Maggiolo was the first to report in his atlas of 1548 the toponym of the South American river Rio de Amaxones.

<doc id="542656" wikidata="Q373901" url="?curid=542656" title="Monaghan">
<text>Monaghan ( ; ) is the county town of County Monaghan, Ireland. It also provides the name of its civil parish and Monaghan barony.

The population of the town as of the 2022 census was 7,894. The town is on the N2 road from Dublin to Derry and Letterkenny.
==Etymology==
The Irish name &quot;Muineachán&quot; derives from a diminutive plural form of the Irish word &quot;muine&quot; meaning &quot;brake&quot; (a thickly overgrown area) or sometimes &quot;hillock&quot;. The Irish historian and writer Patrick Weston Joyce interpreted this as &quot;a place full of little hills or brakes&quot;. Monaghan County Council&#x27;s preferred interpretation is &quot;land of the little hills&quot;, a reference to the numerous drumlins in the area.

==History==

===Early history===
The Menapii Celtic tribe are specifically named on Ptolemy&#x27;s 150 AD map of Ireland, where they located their first colony – Menapia – on the Leinster coast . They later settled around Lough Erne, becoming known as the Fir Manach, and giving their name to Fermanagh and Monaghan. Mongán mac Fiachnai, a 7th-century King of Ulster, is the protagonist of several legends linking him with Manannan mac Lir. They spread across Ireland, evolving into historic Irish (also Scottish and Manx) clans.

The Battle of Clontibret, fought between the forces of The Earl of Tyrone, &quot;An Ó Néill&quot; (The O&#x27;Neill), of Tír Eoghain, and the English Crown, was fought in northern County Monaghan in May 1595. The territory of Monaghan had earlier been wrested from the control of the MacMahon sept in 1591, when the leader of the MacMahons was hanged by authority of the Dublin government; this was one of the events that led to the Nine Years War and the Tudor conquest of Ireland.

In 1801, Monaghan Town, along with the rest of the Rossmore Estate, became the property of the Westenra family. The Rossmore Estate was inherited in August of that year by Warner Westenra, 2nd Baron Rossmore, from his uncle. The Westenra family remained as the principal landlords of Monaghan town up into the early twentieth-century. Their &#x27;ancestral seat&#x27; was established at Rossmore Castle (also known as Rossmore Park), a large country house mainly built in stages during the nineteenth-century on the south-western edge of Monaghan Town. The castle was mainly built in the neo-Jacobean style of architecture.

 The castle stood on the south-western edge of Monaghan town and was abandoned just after the Second World War. The ruins of the castle were blown up by Monaghan County Council in 1974.

===Transport===
The Ulster Canal through Monaghan linking the River Blackwater at Moy with the River Erne near Clones was built between 1825 and 1842. By the time it was completed, competition in the form of the Ulster Railway from Belfast to Clones was already under construction. The canal was never a commercial success and was formally abandoned in 1931.

The Ulster Railway linked Monaghan with and Belfast in 1858 and with the Dundalk and Enniskillen Railway at Clones in 1863. It became part of the Great Northern Railway in 1876. The partition of Ireland in 1922 turned the boundary with County Armagh into an international frontier, after which trains were routinely delayed by customs inspections. In 1957 the Government of Northern Ireland made the GNR Board close the line between and the border, giving the GNRB no option but to withdraw passenger services between the border and Clones as well. CIÉ took over the remaining section of line between Clones, Monaghan and Glaslough in 1958 but withdrew goods services between Monaghan and Glaslough in 1959 and between Clones and Monaghan in 1960, leaving Monaghan with no railway service.

===Twentieth century===
In February 1919 the first self-consciously proclaimed soviet in the United Kingdom was established at Monaghan Lunatic Asylum. This led to the claim by Joseph Devlin in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom that &quot;the only successfully conducted institutions in Ireland are the lunatic asylums&quot;.

On 17 May 1974 an Ulster loyalist car bomb exploded in the Friday evening rush hour, killing seven people. It was detonated outside Greacen&#x27;s public house on North Road in a car that had been stolen earlier that afternoon in Portadown, Northern Ireland. The bomb killed Paddy Askin (44), Thomas Campbell (52), Thomas Croarkin (36), Archie Harper (73, died four days later), Jack Travers (28), Peggy White (45) and George Williamson (72). It also injured scores of civilians and caused extensive damage to the fabric of the town with North Road and Mill Street among the areas worst affected. This was one of the few car bombings in the Republic during The Troubles, which were centred on Northern Ireland; three other bombs exploded on the same day in Dublin in what became known as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The Ulster loyalist paramilitary group Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) claimed responsibility in 1993.

A monument in memory of the victims was unveiled by the eighth President of Ireland Mary McAleese on 17 May 2004, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the atrocity. The sandstone and metal column containing seven light wells bearing the names of each of the seven victims of the bombing was designed by Ciaran O&#x27;Cearnaigh and stands as a reminder of one of the darkest days in Ireland&#x27;s modern history.

==Culture==

Monaghan continues to host one of Ireland&#x27;s most prestigious and established blues festivals, the Harvest Time Blues Festival. It is hosted every September across Monaghan town.

The Fiddler of Oriel Muineachán Competition (also known as Féile Oriel) first held in 1969 returned in 2009 to celebrate its fortieth anniversary. It is held every May Bank Holiday weekend.

Founded in 1974, Monaghan County Museum is recognised as one of the leading provincial museums in Ireland, with a prestigious Council of Europe Award conferred in 1980, among others, to its credit. The museum is located in a mid-Victorian stone building of three stories, formerly two separate town houses, on Hill Street. It aims to acquaint its visitors with the history of County Monaghan and its people.

The Garage Theatre is an arts facility located on the Monaghan Education Campus. It hosts a wide range of activities including drama, music, dance and film.

The town is home to Monaghan United Football Club, formerly of the League of Ireland Premier Division.

==Local government==

Local issues are dealt with by the Monaghan Municipal Council which elects six members, all of which are elected as members of Monaghan County Council. The town forms part of the Monaghan ward for local elections for elections to Monaghan County Council and part of the Cavan–Monaghan constituency for elections to Dáil Éireann. Monaghan Town Hall is a former bank branch dating from around 1880.

The largest party on the municipal council is Sinn Féin, which holds two of six seats. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil each hold one seat and there are two independent members.

==Town layout and architecture==
The centre of the town is made up of four interconnecting squares: Market Square (or Street), Church Square, The Diamond and Old Cross Square.

Dating from the seventeenth century, the oldest remaining architectural feature in Monaghan town is the &quot;Old Cross&quot; – located in Old Cross Square. It is not fully agreed that it is in fact a cross, but may in fact have been a seventeenth-century sundial. It was originally located in the Diamond, the traditional centre of the town, and was used as a hiring cross and for the attaching of proclamations. It was moved to its present location in 1876 to allow for the construction of the Rossmore Memorial. Two landmark buildings remain from the eighteenth century, Aviemore House (built in 1760) on Mill Street and the &quot;extremely elegant&quot; Market House (from 1792) on Market Square.

Monaghan is notable for the quality of its nineteenth-century architecture, which adds a sense of dignity to the attractive town centre and its environs. Of its Victorian buildings, the Monaghan Courthouse on Church Square, designed by Joseph Welland and built in 1830, is the most stately. With its sandstone facade of Doric columns supporting a pediment that bears the royal arms of the House of Hanover, Monaghan Courthouse constitutes an integral part of Church Square.

The Rossmore Memorial in The Diamond was built in 1876 as a memorial to The 4th Baron Rossmore, who died after a hunting accident at Windsor Castle in 1874. This Victorian monument, described by architectural historian C.E.B. Brett as &quot;formidable and striking&quot; is octagonal in shape, with central marble columns supporting a fountain. Around it, the eight grey columns support the pinnacled superstructure which rises to a dome. The dome is surmounted by a spire supported by yet more columns. The letters of Rossmore (also eight in number) are spaced out around the monument.
The Gothic-Revival St Macartan&#x27;s Cathedral by James Joseph McCarthy is recognised as being &quot;one of McCarthy&#x27;s best works: an excellent example of the High Victorian ecclesiastical style at its best, rich without ever being over-ornate&quot;. The building comprises a delicate rose window and an impressive soaring spire and took over thirty years to complete. Construction work began in 1861 and the cathedral was finally dedicated in 1892. Originally the nave was intended to be two bays longer but lack of funds meant that the design was cut back. The Cathedral sits on an imposing site overlooking the town. Occupying a similarly commanding site on the opposite side of the town is St Macartan&#x27;s College for boys (from 1840), a 17-bay classical structure with a bell tower and private chapel, by the Newry-born architect Thomas Duff.
Church Square is very much an environment in which the civic pride of Victorian improvers lives on in the satisfying essay in the Ruskinian-Gothic style that is the Bank of Ireland building, as much as in the peaks of St. Patrick&#x27;s Church of Ireland and the Dawson Obelisk. One of the most interesting aspects of Monaghan&#x27;s Victorian architectural heritage, which also includes the former railway station, the Orange Hall on North Road and the Westenra Hotel on the Diamond, is the rounded corners that connect the town&#x27;s buildings from one street or square to the next. This practice of rounding corners in order to open up panoramic vistas was carried out with unprecedented frequency in the town of Monaghan, and is still reflected today in the edifices of The Diamond, Church Square and Mill Street, helping to secure Monaghan&#x27;s status as one of Ulster&#x27;s more attractive large towns.

==Economy==
The town is a centre for the timber-frame house building industry with Kingspan Century being the largest of its kind in Europe. It is also the centre of a thriving agri business most notable of which is the mushroom industry. Engineering also features in the region with both Moffett and Combilift major participants in the materials handling market.

There is a campaign to boost tourism by reopening the Ulster Canal in a scheme which would eventually allow boats to travel from towns in Northern Ireland, such as Newry, by way of Monaghan to places as far south as Limerick, as well as Dublin.

Monaghan once had a thriving furniture manufacturing industry. Since 1990, this has diminished greatly under global competition. However, manufacturers such as Rossmore Furniture (which took its name from Rossmore Forest Park, situated just outside the town) continue to operate from the town.

==Education==
The town has four primary schools:
* Gaelscoil Ultain
* Monaghan Model School
* St. Louis Girls&#x27; National School
* Scoil Mhuire Muineachan - St. Mary&#x27;s Boys&#x27; School

and five secondary schools:
* St. Louis Secondary School
* St Macartan&#x27;s College
* Monaghan Collegiate School
* Coláiste Oiriall
* Beech Hill College

== Transport ==
Public transport operator Bus Éireann routes 32 , 65 , 162 , 175 , 182 all service the town.

TFI Local Link services the town via the following routes:

* M1 
* M2 
* M3 
* 176 

==Notable people==
*Jonathan Douglas, footballer
*The Rt Hon. Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, politician and co-founder of &quot;The Nation&quot;, subsequently the eighth Premier of Victoria, was born at 10 Dublin Street.
*Jim Lynagh, Republican who was a volunteer in the East Tyrone Brigade of the Provisional Irish Republican Army

In probability theory and statistics, the logistic distribution is a continuous probability distribution. Its cumulative distribution function is the logistic function, which appears in logistic regression and feedforward neural networks. It resembles the normal distribution in shape but has heavier tails (higher kurtosis). The logistic distribution is a special case of the Tukey lambda distribution.

== Specification ==

=== Cumulative distribution function ===
The logistic distribution receives its name from its cumulative distribution function, which is an instance of the family of logistic functions. The cumulative distribution function of the logistic distribution is also a scaled version of the hyperbolic tangent.

:formula_17

In this equation is the mean, and is a scale parameter proportional to the standard deviation.

=== Probability density function ===

The probability density function is the partial derivative of the cumulative distribution function:

: formula_18

When the location parameter  is 0 and the scale parameter  is 1, then the probability density function of the logistic distribution is given by

: formula_19

Because this function can be expressed in terms of the square of the hyperbolic secant function &quot;sech&quot;, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;sech-square(d) distribution&quot;. (See also: hyperbolic secant distribution).

=== Quantile function ===
The inverse cumulative distribution function (quantile function) of the logistic distribution is a generalization of the logit function. Its derivative is called the quantile density function. They are defined as follows:

:formula_20

:formula_21

=== Alternative parameterization ===
An alternative parameterization of the logistic distribution can be derived by expressing the scale parameter, formula_22, in terms of the standard deviation, formula_23, using the substitution formula_24, where formula_25. The alternative forms of the above functions are reasonably straightforward.

== Applications ==
The logistic distribution—and the S-shaped pattern of its cumulative distribution function (the logistic function) and quantile function (the logit function)—have been extensively used in many different areas.

=== Logistic regression ===
One of the most common applications is in logistic regression, which is used for modeling categorical dependent variables (e.g., yes-no choices or a choice of 3 or 4 possibilities), much as standard linear regression is used for modeling continuous variables (e.g., income or population). Specifically, logistic regression models can be phrased as latent variable models with error variables following a logistic distribution. This phrasing is common in the theory of discrete choice models, where the logistic distribution plays the same role in logistic regression as the normal distribution does in probit regression. Indeed, the logistic and normal distributions have a quite similar shape. However, the logistic distribution has heavier tails, which often increases the robustness of analyses based on it compared with using the normal distribution.

=== Physics ===
The PDF of this distribution has the same functional form as the derivative of the Fermi function. In the theory of electron properties in semiconductors and metals, this derivative sets the relative weight of the various electron energies in their contributions to electron transport. Those energy levels whose energies are closest to the distribution&#x27;s &quot;mean&quot; (Fermi level) dominate processes such as electronic conduction, with some smearing induced by temperature. However the pertinent &quot;probability&quot; distribution in Fermi–Dirac statistics is actually a simple Bernoulli distribution, with the probability factor given by the Fermi function.

The logistic distribution arises as limit distribution of a finite-velocity damped random motion described by a telegraph process in which the random times between consecutive velocity changes have independent exponential distributions with linearly increasing parameters.

=== Hydrology ===

In hydrology the distribution of long duration river discharge and rainfall (e.g., monthly and yearly totals, consisting of the sum of 30 respectively 360 daily values) is often thought to be almost normal according to the central limit theorem. The normal distribution, however, needs a numeric approximation. As the logistic distribution, which can be solved analytically, is similar to the normal distribution, it can be used instead. The blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the logistic distribution to ranked October rainfalls—that are almost normally distributed—and it shows the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of the cumulative frequency analysis.

=== Chess ratings ===
The United States Chess Federation and FIDE have switched its formula for calculating chess ratings from the normal distribution to the logistic distribution; see the article on Elo rating system (itself based on the normal distribution).

== Related distributions ==
* Logistic distribution mimics the sech distribution; they are different cases of the Champernowne distribution.
* If formula_26 then formula_27.
* If formula_28 U(0, 1) then formula_29, where formula_30 is the logit function.
* If formula_31 and formula_32 independently then formula_33.

<doc id="542667" wikidata="Q1137652" url="?curid=542667" title="Maastricht University">
<text>Maastricht University (abbreviated as UM; ) is a public research university in Maastricht, the Netherlands. Founded in 1976, it is the second youngest of the thirteen Dutch universities.

In 2023, 22,976 students studied at Maastricht University, 59% of whom were students from outside of the Netherlands, with over 4,000 employees. About half of the bachelor&#x27;s programmes are fully offered in English, while the other half is taught wholly or partly in Dutch. Most of the master&#x27;s and doctoral programmes are in English. Besides traditional programmes, Maastricht University also has three honours liberal arts colleges: University College Maastricht and the Maastricht Science Programme in the same liberal arts tradition. The satellite University College Venlo opened in 2015.

== History ==
Maastricht University was officially established in 1976. Faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the Dutch government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country&#x27;s medical training facilities. Political leaders in the province of Limburg, most notably Sjeng Tans, the chairman of the Labour Party and former member of the Limburg provincial council and Maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in Maastricht. This academic institution would be vital to sustain the intellectual life of the city, and indeed the whole province. Moreover, it was argued that the establishment of a university in Maastricht could contribute to the government&#x27;s restructuring efforts in this part of the Netherlands, which was experiencing economic challenges following the collapse of the Limburg coal mining industry.

The newly established school chose not to await official recognition but to start its educational programme in September 1974, adopting an innovative approach to academic education in the form of problem-based learning. About 50 students enrolled in the first academic year. By the end of 1975, the Dutch Parliament eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees. The new university, named &quot;Rijksuniversiteit Limburg&quot; (State University of Limburg), was officially established on 9 January 1976, when Queen Juliana of the Netherlands signed the university&#x27;s founding charter at a ceremony in the Basilica of Saint Servatius. Sjeng Tans became the university&#x27;s first president.

Soon after its establishment, the university gained political support to increase its funding and to expand into other academic fields. The faculty of law was created in 1981, followed by the faculty of economics in 1984. In 1994, the faculty of arts and culture and one year later the faculty of psychology were established. The faculty of humanities and sciences started in 2005, containing a variety of organisational units, such as the department of knowledge engineering and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance. Together with the faculty of health, medicine and life sciences (established in 2007 as a merger between the faculty of health sciences and the faculty of medicine) Maastricht University currently has six faculties.

The university was renamed &quot;Universiteit Maastricht&quot; in 1996 and added its English-language name in 2008. As of 2010, Maastricht University consists of six faculties offering 17 bachelor programmes, 56 master programmes and several Ph.D. programmes.

=== 2019 cyber attack ===
On December 23, 2019, Maastricht University suffered a major cyber-attack, more specifically a Microsoft Windows ransomware attack using &quot;Clop&quot;. The ransomware encrypted almost all Windows systems used by Maastricht University, making it impossible for students and staff members to access any university online services during the Christmas break. A ransom was set from the offenders, which allowed a decryption of the university systems after Maastricht University paid €200,000 in a Bitcoin transfer. The lessons resumed with no delays on 6 January, with most online services again available to both students and staff members.

In 2020, the public prosecutor service seized the cryptocurrency account in which the ransom was paid. Once the ransom was converted from Bitcoin to Euros, the University was able to recover €500.000, double of what was paid.

==Campuses==
Maastricht University is located in buildings in two separate locations in Maastricht. The arts, humanities and social science departments are housed in a number of historic buildings in the city center, while psychology, the medical and life sciences are based in the modern Randwyck campus on the outskirts of the city.

===City Centre Campuses===
The university&#x27;s arts, humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht&#x27;s city centre, west of the river Meuse. Most of the university&#x27;s inner city properties have official monumental status. As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed to the preservation and liveliness of Maastricht&#x27;s historic city centre.

====University buildings in Jekerkwartier====
The first building that was obtained by the university was the former Jesuit monastery and seminary at Tongersestraat, largely dating from the 1930s. Here, in 1974 the newly established medical school started. After the faculty of medicine moved to premises closer to the newly constructed university hospital, the Jesuit monastery became home to the Faculty of Economy, which is now the university&#x27;s largest academic unit in terms of student numbers. The building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant (&quot;mensa&quot; in Dutch) and a large lecture hall designed by Dutch architect Jo Coenen.

The Faculty of Law is housed in the building known as &quot;Oud Gouvernement&quot; in Bouillonstraat, which was completed in 1935 as the provincial government building. It was acquired by the UM in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new premises on the river Meuse in the southeastern part of the city. Opposite lies &quot;Slijpe Court&quot;, a 17th-century mansion that in 2002 was refurbished to house the Department of Knowledge Engineering of the Faculty of Humanities and Science.

The university&#x27;s administrative headquarters is located at &quot;Minderbroedersberg&quot;, in a former Franciscan monastery, which dates back to 1699 and was later used as a court house and prison. The UM acquired the building in order to make it their administrative center in 1999. The Minderbroedersberg, with its &quot;Aula&quot; (main hall), also serves as the university&#x27;s primary location for official academic ceremonies, such as Ph.D. conferrals.

At the bottom of the hill lies the former convent of the &quot;Bonnefanten&quot;, now the university&#x27;s Student Service Center, as well as a visitor center, including a gift shop. This building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent for nuns originally from Liège who were referred to as &quot;bons enfants&quot;, &quot;good children&quot;. In the twentieth century, the city&#x27;s art museum was established here and later took its name from the building, Bonnefantenmuseum. In 1979 the building became the main branch of the university library, until the library moved to its current location. The oldest part of the library building at Grote Looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and served as the city&#x27;s poor house and military hospital. In the 1970s, the city&#x27;s public library was built in the garden. In 1999 the city library moved to its current location at Centre Ceramique. The old library was then acquired by the UM. After major renovation and expansion works, the university library relocated here in 2003.

University College Maastricht is located at Zwingelput in a 15th-century béguinage, named &quot;Nieuwenhof&quot;. Maastricht Science College has its new home since 2012 in the renovated &quot;Hustinx Mansion&quot; in Kapoenstraat, which has a richly ornamented façade and a courtyard that is now covered.

Since 2013, the university has acquired several buildings on the site of the former Tapijn barracks, adjacent to the city park (&quot;Stadspark&quot;). Although outside the medieval centre, the area is still part of the Jekerkwartier. In 2019 the main U-shaped buildings were refurbished and enlarged with an underground atrium. They now house UM Learning Spaces. Other buildings at the Tapijn Campus are used temporarily by Knowledge Engineering and to help start-up enterprises.

====University buildings elsewhere in the city centre====
Several other university institutions are housed in buildings elsewhere in the city centre. The UM Language Centre is based in an old canon&#x27;s house at Sint Servaasklooster. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASoS) currently occupies three adjacent buildings on Grote Gracht. &quot;Soiron Mansion&quot;, built by the architect Matthias Soiron for his two brothers, canons of Saint Servatius Church, the former Ursuline girls schools, and &quot;Tilly Court&quot;, built for the Count of Tilly, the military governor of Maastricht, both date from the 18th century.


===Randwyck Campus===
The Randwyck campus was developed from the 1970s onwards and has become the center for the university&#x27;s psychology, health, medicine and life science activities. Here, plans for the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus are aimed at strengthening the scientific and economic impact of Randwyck. The Randwyck and Brightlands campuses are not to be confused with the failed Calatrava Campus, also in Randwyck, which in 2008 had to be abandoned after construction had already begun, because the cost spiraled out of control.

The focal point for the Randwyck campus is the academic hospital (azM), which moved here from its original location on the West bank of the Meuse river in 1992. Some of university buildings are physically connected to the hospital, built in the 1990s. The university and the AZM work together in the Maastricht University Medical Center+, established in 2008.

In 2019, UM bought an existing office blok in Paul-Henri Spaaklaan, which after refurbishment will house the Department of Knowledge Engineering.

===Satellite campuses===
In recent years, the university has opened offices in the northern Limburg city of Venlo, the Belgian capital of Brussels and the city of Bangalore, India.

The Maastricht University, Campus Venlo is located in the renovated &quot;Raad van Arbeid&quot; building at Nassaustraat, close to the center of Venlo. Maastricht University currently offers two Master&#x27;s programmes (Global Supply Chain Management, and Health Food Innovation Management) and a Bachelor&#x27;s programme (University College Venlo) at this campus . Courses at University College Venlo started in September 2015.

==Organisation==
===Governance===

At the central level, the university is governed by the Executive Board, consisting of a president, a vice-president and a rector. The Executive Board appoints faculty deans, other administrators and professors and has general management responsibilities. It is advised by the Supervisory Council that vets for instance the budget.
The University Council, an elected body representing all members of staff and students at the university, has a limited number of decision-making powers as well as general advising responsibilities regarding the university&#x27;s teaching and research programmes and in organisational and budgetary matters.

Maastricht University&#x27;s teaching and research programmes are primarily carried out along the lines of faculties. Within faculties, teaching and research activities may be further decentralised through departments, schools, institutes or colleges. The names of organisational (sub)units, however, do not necessarily indicate their position within the university&#x27;s organisational hierarchy. In 2009, for example, the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration was renamed school of business and Economics, even though it maintains the rank of a faculty.

The Board of Deans, consisting of all faculty deans and the Rector, acts as a coordinating and consulting body at the central level and is responsible for awarding doctoral degrees and honorary doctorates.

=== Faculties ===
==== Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences ====

The Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (FHML) was established in 2007 as a merger between the faculty of health sciences and the faculty of medicine. The latter was the first faculty to be established at Maastricht University. In 1980 the faculty of health sciences was founded. The broad range of disciplines it offered in healthcare sciences, made the faculty unique, not only in the Netherlands, but also in Europe. The format allowed students to integrate their discipline and research work into all areas related to society, health and disease. A one-year master&#x27;s program in global health is available.

The two united faculties have developed into a community of approximately 1950 students, with a staff of around 1200 (academics, administrative and support staff). Since 1992 staff and students are based in the Randwyck district, near the University Hospital (&quot;Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht&quot; or AZM) which opened in 1991. The AZM has been renamed MUMC+ (Maastrichts Universitair Medisch Centrum Plus).

==== Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience ====

Founded in 1995, the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience (FPN) is specialised in two contemporary approaches in psychology: cognitive psychology and biological psychology. It is home to around 1,500 students and 250 staff. The faculty offers a Dutch and English bachelor&#x27;s programme in psychology, two English-taught master&#x27;s programmes and one research master&#x27;s programme. The one-year master&#x27;s programme in psychology offers specialisations in neuropsychology, developmental psychology, cognitive neuroscience, health and social psychology, psychology and law, work and organisational psychology. In conjunction with the faculty of health, Medicine and Life Sciences, the two-year research master Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience offers six different specialisations: cognitive neuroscience, fundamental neuroscience, neuropsychology, drug development and neurohealth, neuroeconomics and psychopathology. The selective two-year master programme Forensic Psychology in English, offers theoretical, research and skills courses, to educate students to become scientist-practitioners in the field of forensic psychology and psychiatry. The faculty&#x27;s unique research infrastructure – including hypermodern high field MRI scanners – allows for groundbreaking research into the brain and behaviour.

==== School of Business and Economics ====
The School of Business and Economics (SBE) was founded in 1984. It is currently the biggest faculty within UM in terms of student numbers. Of the 4,200 students enrolled, more than 60% come from abroad. As a business school, SBE is accredited by EQUIS, AACSB and the Association of MBAs. According to the school&#x27;s website, this Triple Crown accreditation has only been achieved by 1% of business schools worldwide.
SBE offers bachelor&#x27;s programmes (B.Sc.) in International Business, Business Engineering, Economics and Business Economics, Fiscal Economics, and Econometrics and Operations Research, as well as a number of master&#x27;s programmes, executive master&#x27;s programmes and MBA&#x27;s. SBE students are represented by SCOPE Maastricht, the School&#x27;s general student association.

==== Faculty of Law ====

Maastricht University&#x27;s Faculty of Law (FL) was founded in 1981. Times Higher Education (THE) ranks the university&#x27;s Law programme at 40th in the world in 2020. It started with a programme in Dutch law, designed in line with UM&#x27;s problem-based learning principles. Ninety students enrolled in the first year. In the 1990s, the faculty introduced a new programme entitled the European Law School (ELS), which focused on European, comparative and international law. The programme was taught partly in English. A fully English-language ELS programme was established in 2007. It was the first English-language bachelor&#x27;s programme in law in the Netherlands. The faculty currently consists of about 2,500 students and 150 members of staff. It offers four bachelor&#x27;s (LL.B.) programmes: Dutch law, tax law, the Dutch-language ELS and the English-language ELS. In addition, the faculty offers seven master&#x27;s (LL.M.) programmes and three advanced master&#x27;s programmes, most of which are taught in English.

In research, the faculty&#x27;s Graduate School of Law has built a reputation in the areas of international, European and comparative law. 
The faculty participates in two national research schools, the School of Human Rights and the Ius Commune Research School, and is home to several research institutes: the Institute for Transnational Legal Research (METRO), the Maastricht Centre for Human Rights, the Institute for Globalisation and International Regulation (IGIR), the Montesquieu Institute Maastricht, the Institute for Corporate Law, Governance and Innovation Policies (ICGI), and the Maastricht European Private Law Institute (M-EPLI).

The faculty was initially located at the Nieuwenhof béguinage, currently home to University College Maastricht. With the number of students growing quickly, the faculty moved to its current location in 1990. This building, the former seat of the provincial government of Limburg, consists of tutorial rooms, lecture halls as well as staff offices. The building underwent major renovation works around 2009, which included a new common room and lunch counter for students, a garden terrace, and an additional lecture hall in the former ballroom.


==== Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences ====
The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, also known as FASoS, was founded in 1994. Currently FASoS hosts approximately 2000 students and around 240 staff members. Over 70% of the students are non-Dutch. Research and education is internationally oriented and all of the programmes are offered in English. The faculty is located in the centre of Maastricht, in four buildings on the Grote Gracht.

The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences offers four three-year bachelors programmes: Cultuurwetenschappen/Arts and Culture, European Studies, Digital Society and Global Studies, and eight one-year masters programmes: European Studies; Globalisation and Development Studies; European Public Affairs; European Studies on Society, Science and Technology; Arts and Heritage; Policy, Management and Culture; Media Culture; Art, Literature and Society; and Politics and Society. Furthermore, two two-year research masters are offered: Cultures of Arts, Science and Technology; and European Studies.

The Research Institute for Arts and Social Sciences encompasses all research of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. The Research Institute comprises four programmes: 1. Politics and Culture in Europe, 2. Science, Technology and Society, 3. Cultural Memory and Diversity and 4. Globalisation, Transnationalism and Development. The research area overlaps both the humanities and the social sciences. The faculty has a graduate school with an intake of about 10 PhD candidates each year.

==== Faculty of Science and Engineering====
The Faculty of Science and Engineering (FSE), formerly the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences, consists of:
* University College Maastricht (UCM)
* University College Venlo (UCV)
* Department of Advanced Computing Sciences (DACS)
* Maastricht Science Programme (MSP)
* Foundation Programme (FP)
* TIER: Top Institute for Evidence Based Education Research

=== Tuition and financial assistance ===

Tuition fees at Maastricht University vary, depending on nationality and study programme. Regular tuition fees for public universities in the Netherlands are determined annually by law. Statutory tuition fees currently amount to €2,060 annually for both bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programmes. Under European regulations, regular tuition levels are also applicable to foreign students from the European Economic Area, which includes all European Union member states. All other students pay institutional tuition fees, ranging from €7,500 to €10,000 annually for bachelor&#x27;s programmes and €13,000 or more annually for master&#x27;s programmes. Since 2012, students at the University College pay a surcharge on top of the statutory or institutional tuition fees to fund additional facilities, a student grants programme and student organisations at the college. An earlier plan to introduce a separate institutional fee at the University College was shelved after criticism from staff and students.

Ph.D. candidates (&quot;promovendi&quot;) at Maastricht University do not pay tuition as they have the rank of junior members of the academic staff. Ph.D. candidates are employed by the university or faculty on full-time, four-year contracts with regular, entry-level wages and employee benefits. Ph.D. appointments usually involve teaching responsibilities and limited administrative duties.

The Limburg University Fund, a fundraising foundation associated with the UM, administers a scholarship fund for students from emerging markets.

Maastricht University&#x27;s academic staff consists of about 1,900 members with a male/female ratio of 54/46. The number of support staff members amounts to 1,600, of which about 62% is female. Nearly 20% of UM&#x27;s staff members hold a foreign nationality. In 2014 about 17% of professors at Maastricht University were women, which is more or less the average in the Netherlands.

=== Teaching ===
Maastricht University awards degrees at all levels up to the title of &quot;doctor&quot;.

Teaching at Maastricht University is founded on the educational principles of problem-based learning (PBL). According to its website, UM is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes. In 1974, Maastricht&#x27;s newly established faculty of medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method. As PBL was originally designed for medical education, other faculties have developed a PBL approach that corresponds with the needs of their academic disciplines.

At the heart of Maastricht&#x27;s PBL philosophy is the idea that students are personally responsible for their own academic education. A typical UM course revolves around so-called &#x27;tutorial groups&#x27;. A tutorial group usually consists of 14 to 16 students, meeting once or twice a week to discuss self-identified problems on the basis of cases or situations described in the course manual. Each tutorial meeting consists of two parts: a post-discussion, where problems which have been identified at the previous session are discussed on the basis of assigned literature and sometimes with additional library research, followed by a pre-discussion of topics to be discussed at the next meeting. The tutorial group is chaired by a student member, who is expected to structure the discussion and ensure that every member of the group is able to participate. The instructor, typically named &#x27;tutor&#x27;, plays only a limited role during tutorials. Tutors will monitor discussions, provide feedback, and, where needed, help students in identifying relevant problems. Courses usually take seven weeks of tutorials followed by a final exam, but may also include writing or speaking assignments.

Even though traditional lecture-based teaching is at odds with the primarily self-guiding PBL approach, it has become customary in many programmes at Maastricht to include at least some lectures in courses to supplement the tutorial-based structure. Also, electronic learning methods are increasingly being used. As PBL courses are intensive, students can take only two or three courses at a time depending on the number of credit hours per course. The university&#x27;s Language Centre offers an introduction to Maastricht&#x27;s PBL approach for international students.

=== Rankings and reputation ===

According to &quot;Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2016&quot;, Maastricht University occupied 88th (121st as of 2021) position in the world ranking. 
QS World University Rankings 2017/18 ranked Maastricht University as the 200th best university in the world, while &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; (or &quot;Shanghai Ranking&quot;) counted Maastricht among the world&#x27;s top 300 universities, since 2011.

In the &quot;QS Top 50 Under 50&quot;, which ranks the top 50 universities under 50 years old around the world, UM reached the 19th place in 2021.

In a similar list published by THE (&quot;THE 100 Under 50 universities 2021&quot;), Maastricht University was placed at the 6th in the world.

In terms of specific areas of studies, THE ranks Maastricht University at 23rd in the field of &quot;Law,&quot; 64th in &quot;Clinical &amp; health&quot; and 72nd in &quot;Business &amp; Economics&quot; in the world for 2022. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; places the school of business and Economics at the 60th place in 2016.

The School of Business and Economics has been awarded the &#x27;Triple accreditation&#x27; by the prestigious AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA.

In addition to excellent medicine, business, and law programs, Maastricht University may perhaps be best known for the excellent reputation of its psychology department attracting students and researchers from across the world. Within the domain of biological psychology, Maastricht University is ranked 5th in the world. Among its excellent facilities, Maastricht University has one of only 5 fully operational Tesla 9.4 MRI scanners found worldwide allowing for ground breaking research in fields of psychology, psychiatry and neuroscience. Furthermore, Maastricht University is also ranked 5th in the world in fields of education and educational research.

=== Research ===

Research at Maastricht University concentrates on three major themes: Quality of Life, Learning and Innovation and Europe and a Globalising World. Examples of issues addressed through UM research are: healthy ageing, climate change, demographic changes, sustainability, the impact of technological developments, population ageing, healthy and affordable food, and the European integration process. A lot of this research is conducted in multidisciplinary teams and in institutes such as CARIM, the School for Cardiovascular Diseases.

A noted research platform is Scannexus (formerly known as: Brains Unlimited): a scanning lab at the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus, offering three MRI scanners with ultrahigh magnetic fields, including one of only four 9.4 Tesla scanners worldwide. Professor Rainer Goebel, director of the affiliated Maastricht Brain Imaging Centre (M-Bic), has been rewarded several large international research grants. The internationally renowned Tissue Regeneration group of Professor Clemens van Blitterswijk moved to Maastricht University in February 2014. His presence fits in the large investment programme &quot;Kennis-As Limburg&quot;, that aims to strengthen the provincial knowledge economy. So does the Institute of Nanoscopy, led by Professor Peter Peters.

In 2011 the number of dissertations at the University of Maastricht had reached 213; the number of scientific publications 3,567. Most PhD programmes take place in faculty research units (so-called graduate schools) or associated institutes.

<text>Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown (ITB) () established in 1999, was a third-level institution outside Dublin. In 2019, it merged with the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) and the Institute of Technology Tallaght (ITT) to form the new Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin). 

It was the last-founded Institute of Technology in Ireland. The campus is located within the Business and Technology Park on Blanchardstown Road North, about 15 km from Dublin City and close to the N3 (Navan Road). This is situated in the townland of Buzzardstown, in the civil parish of Mulhuddart.

ITB provided full-time and part-time higher education courses in a range of subjects, making awards at levels from higher certificate, to PhD.

==Historic statutes and governance==
===Statutory basis===
The Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act 1999 was enacted by the Oireachtas in July 1999, putting the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown on the same statutory footing as the twelve other Institutes of Technologies in Ireland already operating under the Regional Technical Colleges Acts 1992 and 1994. The institute also operated under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act,1999 and the Institutes of Technology Act 2006.

===Governance===
The institute was overseen by a statutory Governing Body, appointed by the Minister for Education and Science, with representation from the college community, broader local community, business interests and the State. Academic affairs and standards were controlled by the Academic Council.

===Delegated Authority===
ITB achieved delegated authority in 2006 and had the authority to award qualifications (on behalf of HETAC)) to those completing courses up to Level 9 of the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).

===Management===
Management of the institute was led by the President (previously Director), who leads a management team also comprising the Registrar, Secretary and Financial Controller, and Heads of Schools, Departments and other functions (such as the Estates Manager, IT Manager, HR Manager).

==Academic structure and courses==
===Schools and Departments of the Institute===
*School of Business &amp; Humanities
** Department of Business
** Department of Humanities
*School of Informatics &amp; Engineering
** Department of Computing and Creative Digital Media
** Department of Engineering

===Courses===
Full-time and part-time courses were, and are within TUD, offered in Applied Social Studies, Business, Computing, Digital Media, Engineering, Horticulture, Languages, Social and Community Development, Sports Management and Early Childhood Care &amp; Education, with awards made at higher certificate, ordinary degree, honours degree, Master&#x27;s Degree and PhD (doctoral research) levels.

===Research===
The research community at ITB was, and remains within TUD, involved with research and collaboration projects with industry, community organisations and different agencies in the locality. Some of these include National Road Authority, IBM, Intel, Havoc, Wavebob, ESB, Health Service Executive, SMEs on the Innovation Voucher Scheme.
As part of ITB&#x27;s strategic plan 2006-2011 &quot;Making Education Accessible&quot; ITB established itself as a member of the research community within the third level sector in Ireland. The LINC Centre (Learning and Innovation Centre) is the centre which supports the research activities taking place in the Institute supporting technology transfer activities, applied research links with industry and links to the funding agencies for the research activities in the institute.

==Campus==
The college had a campus within Fingal County Council&#x27;s College Business and Technology Park on Blanchardstown Road North, now designated TUD Blanchardstown Campus. The component buildings, with a total area of over 22,000 square metres, and capital cost exceeding €50 million, are:

* A Block: ITB&#x27;s first building, opened September 1999, contains computing and engineering laboratories, three large lecture theatres and offices for Academic Administration, Finance and Human Resources. It also has the counsellor&#x27;s office.
* Learning and Innovation Centre (LINC Building / B Block): Built May–October 2001, initially for workshops, and now hosting small business ventures and supporting college-industry links, as well as post-graduate research facilities.
* Multipurpose Building (C Block): Canteen, medical centre, Students&#x27; Union, chaplains&#x27; offices, sports hall and gym.
* D Block: Apprentice workshops, including electrical, masonry, carpentry and plumbing, as well as maintenance and goods receiving.
* E Block: A two-wing building containing classrooms, science laboratories, language laboratories, two large lecture theatres, most academic staff offices and the student helpdesk.
* F Block: Main entry point, holding the reception, marketing and management offices, and the largest lecture theatre.
* Library: With books primarily related to course work, DVDs and videos, and access to online information in the form of scientific journals, newspapers and databases.

==Student life==
===Sports===
The first sporting club was founded in ITB in 1999. Sports clubs in ITB include Gaelic games, soccer, futsal, pool, basketball, swimming, athletics, martial arts, rugby, badminton, boxing, golf, ski and Olympic handball. Many of these clubs compete at the inter varsity level and have won numerous awards.

ITB offers sports scholarships to full-time students to assist them in reaching their potential, both academically and in their chosen sport. In association with the Leinster GAA there are also a limited number of bursaries awarded to &quot;outstanding&quot; GAA players from Leinster who are registered students of ITB.

===Societies===
ITB also has a number of societies, including an Ethical Hacker Society, Golf Society, Poker and Music Societies.

===Students Union===
The Students Union ITBSU has four student board members, elected every year. Every student who registers at the institute is automatically a member, with a portion of their registration fee going to the upkeep of the Union. In return every student gets a vote in a first past the post system. The Student Union office is located upstairs in the C Block, beside the Common Room. It runs seminars on Student health issues, college outings, information campaigns, and oversees the management of student clubs and societies.

<doc id="542678" wikidata="Q7166649" url="?curid=542678" title="Per Bergersen">
<text>Per Natrud Bergersen (1 October 1960 – 28 June 1990) was a musician from Røros Municipality, Norway. He was killed by a friend in 1990, when 29 years old, with a shotgun. According to news reports the friend said that he did this at Bergersen&#x27;s request, as he wanted help committing suicide.

==Life==
Bergersen was born in Australia. His parents later divorced, with his father, the metallurgist Olav Bergersen, remaining in Australia while his mother, Ingrid Natrud, returned to Røros with her son. She died when he was 13 and he lived with a friend of hers, Reidun Roland. At 16 he began training as a car mechanic and moved to Fastevollen, outside Rorøs. After he turned 18 he moved back to his childhood home and lived off his inheritance from his mother, which included several paintings by Christian Krohg. He taught himself the guitar and started writing songs while living at Fastevollen; in 1983–84 he studied music at Skjeberg Folk High School in Sarpsborg.

==Musical career==
Prior to his untimely death Per Bergersen had published a demo tape, &quot;Redrum Psychosis&quot;, in 1985, and he also contributed a song, &quot;Duejakt&quot;, to a flexi single released by the anarchist journal &quot;Gateavisa&quot;. After his death, the LP &quot;PB&quot; was released by Røros fritidsklubb (a local youth club). 1000 copies were released, which quickly sold out. This LP has gained cult status in various milieux, and is sold used for more than $100. In 2021 it was re-released on CD. &quot;PB&quot; is mainly based on &quot;Redrum Psychosis&quot; and live recordings from Thomasgaarden, Røros, in 1990, the night before he was killed. The lyrics of his song &quot;Kyssing&quot; was used as the theme song of the Norwegian movie, &quot;Store gutter gråter ikke&quot;. There the song had the title &quot;Skyter meg på julaften&quot; which directly translated means &quot;I&#x27;ll shoot myself on Christmas Eve&quot;, which is the opening line of the song. Bergersen&#x27;s version was not included on &quot;PB&quot;.

Per Bergersen wrote most of his songs in Norwegian, although he also had three in English, and much of his material was very dark and sad, probably because of his own depressions and problems, having grown up with his mother until she died when he was 13. Some, however, also had a humorous and grotesque edge, whereas still others were social commentaries. Per Bergersen is considered among many people as the greatest (undiscovered) Norwegian songwriter to ever have lived, and in November 2010 the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation broadcast a half-hour-long documentary on Bergersen titled &quot;Ridder Sjanseløs&quot;. Most of his material would also classify as pretty strong comments towards society and social structures like the song &quot;Sachsenhausen&quot; which have a line that directly translated means something like, &quot;They will fire up the ovens for you or me, they don&#x27;t really care who they burn&quot;. Which must be seen in relation to how Per Bergersen probably felt as an outsider in society and being neither able nor welcome to participate on his own terms.

He has been named as an early influence by Mayhem.

<doc id="542686" wikidata="Q271643" url="?curid=542686" title="Amylopectin">
<text>Amylopectin is a water-insoluble polysaccharide and highly branched polymer of α-glucose units found in plants. It is one of the two components of starch, the other being amylose.

Plants store starch within specialized organelles called amyloplasts. To generate energy, the plant hydrolyzes the starch, releasing the glucose subunits. Humans and other animals that eat plant foods also use amylase, an enzyme that assists in breaking down amylopectin, to initiate the hydrolysis of starch.

Starch is made of about 70–80% amylopectin by weight, though it varies depending on the source. For example, it ranges from lower percent content in long-grain rice, amylomaize, and russet potatoes to 100% in glutinous rice, waxy potato starch, and waxy corn. Amylopectin is highly branched, being formed of 2,000 to 200,000 glucose units. Its inner chains are formed of 20–24 glucose subunits.

Dissolved amylopectin starch has a lower tendency of retrogradation (a partial recrystallization after cooking—a part of the staling process) during storage and cooling. For this main reason, the waxy starches are used in different applications mainly as a thickening agent or stabilizer.

== Structure ==
Amylopectin is a key component in the crystallization of starch&#x27;s final configuration, accounting for 70-80% of the final mass. Composed of α-glucose, it is formed in plants as a primary measure of energy storage in tandem with this structural metric.

Amylopectin bears a &quot;straight/linear&quot; chain along with a number of &quot;side chains&quot; which may be &quot;branched&quot; further. Glucose units are linked in a linear way with α(1→4) Glycosidic bonds. Branching usually occurs at intervals of 25 residues. At the places of origin of a side chain, the branching that takes place bears an α(1→6) glycosidic bond, resulting in a soluble molecule that can be quickly degraded as it has many end points onto which enzymes can attach. Wolform and Thompson (1956) have also reported α(1→3)linkages in case of Amylopectin. Amylopectin contains a larger number of Glucose units (2000 to 200,000) as compared to Amylose containing 200 to 1000 α-Glucose units. In contrast, amylose contains very few α(1→6) bonds, or even none at all. This causes amylose to be hydrolyzed more slowly, but also creates higher density and insolubility.

Amylopectin is divided into &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; helical chains of α-glucose. &quot;A&quot; chains are chains that carry no other chains, resulting in an eventual terminus, whereas &quot;B&quot; chains are chains that do carry other chains, perpetuating the amylopectin polymer. The ratio between these is usually between 0.8 and 1.4.

The formation of chain structures has a direct impact on the overall strength of the polymeric whole; the longer a chain is, the more differing the effects amylopectin will have on starch&#x27;s morphology. Packing of chains, inter block chain length (IB-CL), also has been correlated to have a direct positive impact on the gelatinization temperature of starch granules. In tandem, the IB-CL will increase as the length of &quot;B&quot; chains increases, meaning that as the length of individual &quot;B&quot; chains increases, as does the blocks between connections with other chains. Finally, in general, the more densely packed the resulting molecule of amylopectin, the higher the strength of the starch gel as a whole unit.

Starch utilizes the density-strength correlation of amylopectin as a measure of forming dense, strong bricks as a basis for the final starch configuration. Amylopectin in starch is formed into helices to compose hexagonal structures that will subsequently be differentiated into &quot;A&quot; (cereal) and &quot;B&quot; (high-amylose; tubular) type starch. Structurally, &quot;A&quot; is more compact, while &quot;B&quot; is looser, hence the higher concentration of amylose.

== History ==
The categorization of amylopectin began with the first observation in starch in 1716 by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, where he differentiated starch into two fundamental structural components.

The terms amylose and amylopectin where not coined until 1906, by French researchers Maquenee and Roux in the course of an examination of starch, where they explained variations in the properties of starches according to the mixture of these related substances and variable saccharification by malt extract. Since then and through the 1940s, research focused on various methods of separation, like fractional precipitation or enzymatically. This gave rise to the Meyer definition of amylose and &quot;reserv[ing] the name amylopectin to carbohydrates that are branched molecule, degraded by b-amylase only to the stage of residual dextrin&quot;. Meyer also proposed the tree like structure model for amylopectin.

The currently accepted structural model was proposed in 1972, based on the cluster organization of double helical structures. Other models have been proposed since, such as the Bertoft BB model, or building block and backbone model in 2012. This model claims short chains are the structural building blocks and long chains the backbone to carry the building blocks, and that the different lengths of chain are separated by their position and direction of elongation

== Metabolism ==
Both the formation and degradation of amylopectin is important to the metabolic processes of organisms. Amylopectin is one of the two dominant components of starch, and starch is a successful storage molecule for energy. Because of this, it is synthesized and broken down in most plants and cyanobacteria. In fact, amylopectin seems to rival glycogen, the energy storage molecule in animals, because it is able to store more glucose units and henceforth more energy.

The synthesis of amylopectin depends on the combined efforts of four different enzymes. These four different enzymes are:

# ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase)
# soluble starch synthase (SS)
# starch branching enzyme (BE)
# starch debranching enzyme (DBE)

Amylopectin is synthesized by the linkage of α(1→4) Glycosidic bonds. The extensive branching of amylopectin (α(1→6) Glycosidic bond) is initiated by BE and this is what differentiates amylose from amylopectin. DBE is also needed during this synthesis process to regulate the distribution of these branches.

The breakdown of amylopectin has been studied in context with the breakdown of starch in animals and humans. Starch is mostly composed of amylopectin and amylose, but amylopectin has been shown to degrade more easily. The reason is most likely because amylopectin is highly branched and these branches are more available to digestive enzymes. In contrast, amylose tends to form helices and contain hydrogen bonding.

The breakdown of starch is dependent on three enzymes, among others:

# alpha, beta amylases
# phosphorylases
# starch debranching enzyme (DBE)

There are enzymes that are involved in the synthesis and degradation of amylopectin that have isoforms that display different relationships with proteins and other enzymes. For example, there are many versions of SS (Starch Synthase). Even the third isoform (SS-III) has two different versions. It is believed that SS-I and SS-II both have a role in elongating the chains of amylopectin branches. SS-IV is also thought to be responsible for the leaf-like structure of starch granule clusters.

== Applications ==

=== Food ===
Amylopectin is the most common carbohydrate in the human diet and is contained in many staple foods. The major sources of amylopectin of starch intake worldwide are the cereals such as rice, wheat, and maize, and the root vegetables potatoes and cassava. Upon cooking, amylopectin in the starch is transformed into readily accessible glucose chains with very different nutritional and functional properties. During cooking with high heat, sugars released from amylopectin can react with amino acids via the Maillard reaction, forming advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), contributing aromas, flavors and texture to foods.

The amylose/amylopectin ratio, molecular weight and molecular fine structure influences the physicochemical properties as well as energy release of different types of starches, which affects the number of calories people consume from food. Amylopectin is also sometimes used as a workout supplement due to this caloric density and a correlation with muscle protein synthesis.

Industrially, amylopectin is used as a stabilizer and thickener, such as corn starch. Amylopectin has also been widely used for the development of edible coating films because of its abundance, cost-effectiveness, and excellent film-forming abilities. Amylopectin-based films have good optical, organoleptic and gas barrier properties, however, they have poor mechanical properties. Many attempts have been made to overcome these limitations, such as the addition of co-biopolymers or other secondary additives to improve the mechanical and tensile properties of the films. Properties of the amylopectin-based films can be influenced by many factors, including types of starch, temperature and time during film formation, plasticizers, co-biopolymers, and storage conditions.

=== Textiles ===
Historically, there is a long established use of starch in sizing applications for textiles. As a component of starch, amylopectin is responsible for the retrogradation or crystalline reordering of the starch, which adds rigidity.

This stiffening effect is used for several textile industry processes, such as printing and pressing, to maintain the shape of a fabric over time. Amylopectin is also used as a sizing agent for yarns, to reinforce and protects the fibers from abrasion and breakage during weaving.

=== Engineering ===
Starch and amylopectin are often used in adhesive formulas, and are increasingly examined for further use in construction

== Clinical applications ==
Amylopectin has seen a rise of use in biomedical applications due to its physiological factors, ease of availability, and low cost. Specifically, amylopectin has very advantageous biochemical properties due to its prevalence as a natural polysaccharide. This causes a high sense of biocompatibility with cells and molecules within the body. Amylopectin is also able to biodegrade to a high degree due to its high sense of crosslinking with 1,6 glycosidic bonds. The bonds easily broken down by the body can reduce molecular weight, expose certain regions, and interact certain bonds with clinical factors. Various physical, chemical, and enzymatic methods of modification have also been researched for amylopectin. These, generally, allow for enhanced and controllable properties which can be selected for the field of research performed. Amylopectin&#x27;s main role, clinically, is within its integration in starch. Function and structure of amylopectin is based on its integration with amylose and other bounded molecules. Separating these molecules and isolated amylopectin is quite difficult for researchers to perform.

=== Drug Delivery ===
Drug delivery refers to technology used to present a drug to a pre-determined region of the body for drug emission and absorption. Principles relating to route of administration, metabolism, site of specific targeting, and toxicity are most important within this field. Drugs administered orally (through mouth) are usually encapsulated in some structure in order to protect the drug from immune and biological responses. These structures aim to keep the drug intact until its site of action and release it at a correct dosage when exposed to a specific marker. Corn and potato starch are often used for this as they contain 60-80% amylopectin. They are mostly used in solid preparations: powders, granules, capsules, and tablets. As a natural polysaccharide, it has a compatible nature with anatomical structures and molecules. This prevents any sort of negative immune response, which is a highly controversial topic in drug delivery. Biodegradability of starch allows it to keep the drug intact until reaching its site of action. This allows the drug to avoid low pH situations such as the digestive system. Native starch can also be modified in physical, chemical, and enzymatic ways to improve mechanical or biochemical properties. Within drug delivery, physical modification include treatment under mechanical forces, heat, or pressure. Chemical modifications attempt to alter molecular structure which can include breaking or addition of bonds. Treating starch with enzymes can allow for increased water solubility.

=== Tissue Engineering ===
Tissue engineering aims to generate functional constructs which could replace or improve damaged or infected tissues or whole organs. Many of these constructs lead to infected tissue around the implant area. Coating these materials in amylopectin allows reduction in this infectious reaction. Since amylopectin is mainly used as a coating around these constructs in as it prevents following immune reactions. Since amylopectin is derived directly from a natural polysaccharide, it integrates well with tissues and cells. However, mechanical properties of amylopectin are not optimal due to its high level of crosslinking. This can be avoided by the formation of amylopectin fibers or by forming a nanocomposite with another more rigid polymer.

==== Fibers ====
Amylopectin-based fibers have been fabricated mainly by blending native or modified starches with polymers, plasticizers, cross-linkers, or other additives. Most amylopectin-based fibers are fabricated by electro-wet-spinning, however, the method is demonstrated to be suitable for starches with amylopectin content below 65% and sensitive to amylopectin content of starches. Electrospinning allows for amylopectin to coagulate and form a filament. Fibrous starches induce a more dense material, which can optimize the mechanical properties of starch. Fibers in biomaterials can be used for bone tissue engineering as suitable environment for bone tissue repair and regeneration. Natural bone is a complex composite material composed of an extracellular matrix of mineralized fibers containing living cells and bioactive molecules. Consequently, the use of fibers in biomaterial-based scaffolds offers a wide variety of opportunities to replicate the functional performance of bone. In the last decade, fiber-based techniques such as weaving, knitting, braiding, as well as electrospinning, and direct writing have emerged as promising platforms for making 3D tissue constructs.

==== Bionanocomposites ====
Nanoscience and nanotechnology have been emerging as a technology for the development of various hybrid and composite materials for biomedical applications. When nanomaterials are used for the development of the composites in biology, they are called bionanocomposites. Bionanocomposites have been used in tissue engineering to replace, support, or regenerate the cells, organs, or parts of human entity such that it can function as normal.

Amylopectin-based bionanocomposites are another important class of bionanomaterials, which are biodegradable, with higher mechanical properties, optical transparency, thermal stability, and barrier properties than thermoplastic starch. In conjunction with other nanomaterials like cellulose nanocrystals, nano-ZnO, nanoclay, biodegradable synthetic polymers, starch is one of the most popular materials for the preparation of bionanocomposites for various biomedical applications such as controlled drug release, scaffold for tissue engineering, and cement for bone regeneration. Amylopectin is usually combined with a synthetic polymer with higher elastic modulus and yield strength. This allows for starch to withstand the higher fluid flow and mechanical forces prevalent in bone, cardiac, and endothelial tissue.

<doc id="542689" wikidata="Q1493069" url="?curid=542689" title="Gamelan gong kebyar">
<text>Gamelan gong kebyar is a style or genre of Balinese gamelan music of Indonesia. &quot;Kebyar&quot; means &quot;to flare up or burst open&quot;, and refers to the explosive changes in tempo and dynamics characteristic of the style.

Gong kebyar music is based on a five-tone scale called &quot;pelog selisir&quot; (tones 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the 7-tone pelog scale), and is characterized by brilliant sounds, syncopations, sudden and gradual changes in sound colour, dynamics, tempo and articulation, and complex, complementary interlocking melodic and rhythmic patterns called kotekan.

== History ==
Gamelan gong kebyar was first documented to exist in North Bali in the early 1900s. The first public performance was in December 1915 at a gamelan gong competition in Jagaraga, North Bali.

Following their invasion of the island, Dutch occupiers responded to international criticism by building cultural institutions. They sponsored these competitions until Japanese forces ended their rule in World War II.

== Religious and cultural significance ==
In addition to island-wide arts competitions, gamelan gong kebyar has become an essential part of modern Bali Hindu ceremonies. They are required for annual birthday ceremonies for temples, &quot;odalan&quot;, as well as major holidays as accompaniment for sacred dances. They are also appropriate for the class of rituals centered around human life, &quot;Putra Manusia&quot;, such as weddings.

== Instruments ==
Instruments in gamelan gong kebyar offer a wide range of pitches and timbres, ranging five octaves from the deepest gongs to the highest key on a gangsa. The high end can be described as &quot;piercing&quot;, the low end &quot;booming and sustained,&quot; while the drums as &quot;crisp&quot;. Kebyar instruments are most often grouped in pairs, or &quot;gendered.&quot; Each pair consists of a male and female instrument, the female being slightly larger and slightly lower in pitch. &quot;See the tuning section in this article for more information.&quot;

=== Keyed instruments ===
Most instruments in kebyar are keyed metallophones, with bronze keys resting on suspended chords, over bamboo resonators. The instruments often have ornately carved wooden frames. The gangsa section in gamelan gong kebyar is the largest section, consisting of 13-14 players. Gangsa instruments are played with a mallet, called a &quot;panggul gangsa&quot;. The mallet differs in hardness depending on the instrument and its range. The keys are arranged from low to high, left to right. The key is struck with the hammer in one hand, and damped with the finger and second knuckle of the other hand. The keys can be played in one of three ways:

# Strike the key, and let resonate until sound fades.
# Strike the key, and damp immediately prior to, or simultaneous with, the striking of the next note in the melody. This is especially good for interlocking parts.
# Strike while damping. This gets a dry, pitched click.

The gangsa instruments play elaborate ornamentations (flowers) on the underlying melody (&quot;pokok&quot;, or trunk of the tree) of a piece of music. The explosive feeling of the gong kebyar style derives mainly from the dynamic range of these instruments, whose bright, sharp tones can sound anywhere from soft and sweet to extremely loud and aggressive. Each gendered male/female pair of gangsa is also divided into two interlocking melodic parts, &quot;polos&quot; (mostly plays on the beat) and the &quot;sangsih&quot; (mostly plays off the beat) during kotekan, which permits extremely rapid, virtuosic, and complex patterns to be played.

==== Gangsa kantilan ====
There are four kantilan in kebyar, two male and two female. &quot;See gendered instruments within this article.&quot; These instruments are the highest sounding in the kebyar ensemble, with its highest note being around C7. It has ten keys, and a range of two octaves, and is played with a wooden hammer. Players often sit on the floor to play this instrument.

==== Gangsa pemadé ====
There are also four in , two male and two female. These instruments also have ten keys, a range of two octaves, and are played with a wooden mallet, but are exactly one octave lower than kantilan. Players often sit on the floor to play this instrument.

==== Ugal ====
There is often only one &quot;ugal&quot; in the kebyar ensemble, and it is usually female. It is played by one of the leaders of the ensemble. A second, male ugal is sometimes used. The ugal is taller than the other gangsa, and the player sits on a short stool, so as to allow the player to cue the ensemble visually with ease. The instrument also has 10 keys, with a range of two octaves, and is played with a hard wooden mallet, slightly larger than the other and usually with additional ornamentations so the leader&#x27;s sometimes theatrical cues actively catch the light. Its notes are an octave lower than those of the . The ugals play a combination of gangsa parts and cues, melodic solos, and the underlying melody with flourishes. The first, front ugal cues and plays elements of the polos interlocking gangsa part (the part that plays more often on the beat), and if there is a second ugal, it plays elements of the sangsih part (gangsa notes more often off the beat).

==== Jublag ====
Higher in pitch than the jegog is the (or ; see related xylophone ). This instrument, like jegog, also requires long resonating bamboo tubes so is often played while sitting on a small stool, and consists of one female/male pair. These instruments have a range of one octave, in between and . Some have five keys (1, 2, 3, 5, and 6) but seven key &quot;jublag&quot; are also commonly found in Bali (though gong kebyar ensembles typically do not use notes 4 and 7, using only the pelog selisir scale). It usually plays at submultiples of the &quot;pokok&quot;; the keys are struck more frequently than the &quot;jegogan&quot; and usually less frequently than the &quot;ugal&quot; (playing the &quot;pokok&quot;). The &quot;jublag&quot; part is often the full &quot;pokok&quot; while the &quot;ugal&quot; part includes some ornamentations and flourishes; however, the &quot;jublag&quot; do not play full kebyar sequences, for example. This instrument is one octave above the &quot;jegogan&quot; and overlaps tones with the &quot;ugal&quot;.

==== Jegogan ====

There are two &quot;jegogan&quot; (shortened to &quot;jegog&quot; in everyday speech) in kebyar, one male and one female. These instruments have a range of one fifth, and are one octave below jublag. The keys are considerably larger than those of other &quot;gangsa&quot;, and are played with a large, cloth-coated, rubber-padded spherical mallet. The jegogan plays the deepest tuned notes in the ensemble, typically playing key notes in the underlying melody of a piece of music instead of every note of that melody.

=== Vertically suspended gong family ===
Gongs come in different sizes, and provide a structure for phrasing for the music by repeating a four or eight beat pattern. This pattern is called the gong cycle. Gongs are mounted vertically.

==== Gong gedé ====
Also referred to as just &quot;gong&quot;, &quot;gong gedé&quot; is the deepest, and most resonant. &quot;Gede&quot;, sometimes written &quot;gde&quot;, means &#x27;big&#x27; in Balinese. Because it is the largest of the gongs, it is considered to be the most sacred instrument in kebyar. It is never damped, always allowed to decay. Because of its deep tone, it penetrates through the ensemble and can be heard for miles. It is struck with a large, padded mallet.

==== Kempur ====
A medium-sized gong, the &quot;kempur&quot; is very similar to &quot;gong gedé&quot; as it has very similar qualities, but is just higher in pitch (about an octave and a fifth higher). It is struck with a large, padded mallet.

==== Klentong ====
Also known as the &quot;kemong&quot;, this is much smaller and higher in pitch than the &quot;kempur&quot;. It is struck with a harder mallet than either the &quot;gong gedé&quot; or &quot;kempur&quot;, which allows it to have a sharper attack.

=== Kettle gong family ===
Kettle gongs are round, bronze, and pitched. They are often mounted horizontally on suspended chords as part of a frame. Positioned this way, there is an opening on the bottom, slightly beveled bow on top, and a protruding center called the &quot;boss&quot;. The kettles are arranged from low to high, left to right. They are generally played with a wooden mallet wrapped in string on one end (to soften the attack) or the end of the mallet, which is bare, finished wood. Mallets are held one in each hand as extensions of pointed index fingers. There are four conventional strikes:

# On the boss with the stringed part of the mallet, and immediately released to let it vibrate freely.
# On the boss with the stringed part of the mallet but pressed to damp any vibration.
# On the bow of the kettle with the wood tip of the mallet, and allowed to ring freely.
# On the bow of the kettle with the wood tip of the mallet, but pressed to damp any ringing.

==== Frame mounted horizontal kettle gongs ====

===== Reyong =====
Also spelled &quot;reong&quot;, this instrument consists of 12 kettles mounted horizontally in a row on a frame. It is played by four musicians, each taking responsibility for 2 to 4 of its kettles. The players, who sit in a row, are split into two groups, the first consisting of the first and third players in the row, and the second consisting of the second and fourth players. Both people in the same group play the same part, but doubled an octave apart. The parts of group one and of group two, when played together, are interlocking. The &quot;reyong&quot; has both melodic and non-melodic percussive roles.

===== Trompong =====

The &quot;trompong&quot; is not usually used in kebyar, as it is associated with older genres such as gamelan gong gdé. When it is used, however, it is positioned in front of the ensemble, facing the audience. Constructed similarly to &quot;reyong&quot;, it consists of 10 kettles, with a range of two octaves. It is played by only one person, and that person may be a leader of the ensemble who sits on a short stool, playing the main melodic line. The trompong is also played by a dancer in dance pieces such as Kebyar Trompong and Kebyar duduk. Because of the size of the instrument, the melodies are composed to allow one to slowly shift one&#x27;s position to reach the extremes of its range.

==== Individual horizontal hand held kettle gongs ====

===== Tawa tawa =====
The &quot;tawa tawa&quot; is a small kettle held in the lap or arm and struck on the boss by a mallet with a soft round head. It plays the beats of the gong cycle and acts somewhat like a metronome.

===== Kempli or kajar =====
The and are small kettles set over cords strung on a boxlike stand. They are mainly used as tempo keeping instruments. They are usually played with a cord wrapped stick like those of the &quot;reyong&quot; and &quot;trompong&quot;. The kettle is struck on the boss while damped with the other hand to produce a sharper, dryer sound.

===== Kelenang =====
Also written &quot;klenang&quot;, it is a very small kettle, about 5 inches in diameter, either set on its own stand or held in the hands. It, too, is played with a cord wrapped stick. It plays every second beat of the tempo, usually alternating with the or .

===== Kajar =====
The &quot;kajar&quot; is a small kettle with a recessed boss, held on the lap and played with a hard stick. The &quot;kajar&quot; plays accents to important parts of the rhythm.

=== Primary rhythm instruments ===

==== Kendang ====
The &quot;kendang&quot; is a double-headed drum of jackfruit wood and cowhide. The exterior is shaped like a truncated cone while the negative space of the interior is sculpted like an hourglass. This shape and the cinching action of hide straps creates two distinct, approximate tunings in one drum. Like most gamelan instruments, &quot;kendang&quot; are paired: the larger, lead part female, &quot;wadon&quot;, and the other male, &quot;lanang&quot;. The surfaces inside the &quot;kendang wadon&quot; are carved straighter than those in the &quot;lanang&quot;, resulting in a more resonant, booming timbre.

Much like the syllables for pitches used for pitched instruments, &quot;kendang&quot; have a set of onomatopoetic spoken syllables for each stroke producing a total of 14 types of sound. &quot;Kendang&quot; are played with either bare hands only or bare hands plus one mallet. The &quot;kendang wadon&quot; player typically tops the hierarchy of the ensemble, setting tempi and aurally cuing transitions like a conductor.

The &quot;kendang&quot; part is the most complex in gong kebyar, drawing from a rich lexicon of rapid-fire, syncopated patterns to fit the mood and progression of pitched music. The &quot;lanang&quot; drummer is responsible for filling in an appropriate interlocking part. &quot;Kendang&quot; players may sit facing the same way, &quot;wadon&quot; in front and &quot;lanang&quot; behind.

==== Ceng-ceng ====
Pronounced /t͡ʃeŋ t͡ʃeŋ/, this instrument consists of several small, overlapping cymbals tied to a frame. The frame is often carved to look like an animal, most commonly a turtle, as a mythic turtle is said to carry the island of Bali on its back. The player holds a pair of matching cymbals with bamboo or textile handles, striking the stationary cymbals in quick, even succession or in asymmetrical accents with &quot;kendang&quot; or &quot;reyong&quot;.

=== Soft melody instruments ===

==== Suling ====
One of the two instruments able to bend pitch, the &quot;suling&quot; is a vertical bamboo flute. &quot;Suling&quot; come in a variety of sizes, from a piccolo-like &lt; 1 ft to a breathy 5 ft. The &quot;suling&quot; section doubles and ornaments the melody; the highest register &quot;suling&quot; has the freest rein to improvise. The player circular breathes to allow the pitch to be sustained into a constant tone. A peculiar quality of Balinese &quot;suling&quot;, distinct from Sundanese &quot;suling&quot;, is a combined vibrato from irregular flexing of the jaw and working of the tongue.

&quot;Suling&quot; have retained the complete septatonic tuning of court gamelan and can access tones in the pitch gaps of keyed instruments for effect.

==== Rebab ====
The &quot;rebab&quot; is a spike fiddle played with a bow. It is only sometimes used in &quot;kebyar&quot; as it is often drowned out by the metallophones. Its melodic line is similar to the &quot;suling&quot;, sometimes reaching pitches on a septatonic scale. It has only two strings tuned a Western fourth apart which never touch the unfretted fingerboard. This allows the player to change notes by pressing down on the string, bending the string sideways, sliding, or changing strings.

Unlike a Western string bow, the bow of the &quot;rebab&quot; is deeper and held underhand like that of a viola da gamba. The player&#x27;s thumb applies pressure directly on the hairs to control tension.

=== Tuning and gender ===
There is no standard pitch in any Balinese music. Generally speaking, all instruments in a gamelan gong kebyar ensemble are made and tuned at the same time. Each ensemble is tuned to itself, making it nearly impossible to remove an instrument from one ensemble to use it in another and have it match pitch. In any ensemble, however, instruments are gendered, and their individual tuning depends on that instrument&#x27;s gender.

Almost every instrument in a kebyar ensemble is paired with a male and female counterpart. Each instrument in a pair is tuned differently from its counterpart, one higher and one lower. Played at the same time, the higher instrument (known as &quot;pengisep&quot; or &quot;inhaler&quot;) and the lower instrument (known as the &quot;pengumbang&quot; or &quot;exhaler&quot;), produce a beating effect () by sympathetic resonance, creating an overall shimmering, pulsating quality. The female instrument is tuned lower, while the male instrument is tuned higher. For example, one note on a female might be tuned to 220 Hz, while the male might be tuned slightly higher to 228 Hz. Some kebyar ensembles are tuned so that the numban ensemble is tuned so that the beats are significantly faster for higher frequencies, with the lowest &quot;jegog&quot; notes nearly a quarter-tone apart. A gendered pair of gangsa will play interlocking kotekan melodies, such that in each pair one interlocking part (polos or sangsih) is on the female and the other on the male instrument. The second pair of that instrument (e.g., ) uses the opposite arrangement, so that there is one instrument of each gender playing each part: female polos, male sangsih, female sangsih, and male polos, for full balance.

== Kebyar music ==

=== Kebyar ===
Its namesake refers to the explosive, predominantly unmetered section marking the introduction and some transitions of kebyar compositions. The compositional style derives from &quot;kebyar legong&quot; of Buleleng, North Bali characterized by long, maximum-volume notes simultaneously struck by the whole ensemble, freely ringing glissandi, dramatic tempo changes, and rhythmic triplets.

===Tabuh kreasi baru===
 (&quot;new compositions&quot;) are the primary type of instrumental music in gamelan gong kebyar. Characterized by a succession of passages featuring each instrumental group, they were, &quot;rhapsodic,&quot; and, &quot;loosely constructed,&quot; at the beginning of the 20th century but became increasingly standardized.

=== Gong cycle ===
The music is divided into 4 beat groups, this whole rhythmic cycle is called the gongan. The gongs divide gongan into sections, gong ageng, the largest gong, marks the end of gongan, the smaller gongs mark the 4th or 8th beat and the smallest gongs outline the pulse.

<text>Denpasar (; Balinese: ᬤᬾᬦ᭄ᬧᬲᬃ Roman: &quot;Dénpasar&quot;) is the capital city of the province of Bali, Indonesia. Denpasar is the main gateway to the Bali island, the city is also a hub for other cities in the Lesser Sunda Islands.

With the rapid growth of the tourism industry in Bali, Denpasar has encouraged and promoted business activities and ventures, contributing to it having the highest growth rate in Bali Province. The population of Denpasar was 725,314 at the 2020 Census, down from 788,445 at the 2010 Census due to pandemic outflow; the official estimate as at mid 2022 was 726,808. The Denpasar metropolitan area centred on Denpasar (called Sarbagita) had 1,785,800 residents in mid 2022. Pandemic and travel related closures has further exacerbated the population loss.

==Etymology==
The name Denpasar – from the Balinese words &quot;den&quot;, meaning north, and &quot;pasar&quot;, meaning market – indicates the city&#x27;s origins as a market-town, on the site of what is now Kumbasari Market (formerly &quot;Peken Payuk&quot;), in the northern part of the modern city.

==History==

===Colonial era===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, Denpasar functioned as the capital of the Hindu Majapahit Kingdom of Badung, thus the city&#x27;s former name being Badung. The royal palace was looted and razed during the Dutch intervention in 1906. A statue in Taman Puputan (Denpasar&#x27;s central square) commemorates the 1906 &quot;Puputan&quot;, in which as many as a thousand Balinese, including the King and his court, committed mass suicide in front of invading Dutch troops, rather than surrender to them.

Tuban Airfield, now part of Denpasar International Airport, opened in 1931. It was seized by the Imperial Japanese forces in 1942 during World War II.

===Independence era===
In 1958, Denpasar became the seat of government for the Province of Bali. It remained the administrative centre of both Badung Regency and the City of Denpasar.

Both Denpasar and Badung Regency have experienced rapid physical, economic, social, and cultural growth. Denpasar has become not only the seat of government, but also the centre of commerce, education, industry, and tourism.

With an average population growth of 4.05% per annum, accompanied by rapid development, came a variety of urban problems. It was later resolved that meeting the needs and demands of the burgeoning urban community would be best addressed by giving Denpasar administrative independence from Badung Regency.

An agreement was reached to raise the status of Denpasar to that of an autonomous city and on 15 January 1992, Act No. 1 of 1992 officially established the City of Denpasar. It was inaugurated by the Minister of Home Affairs on 27 February 1992.

On 16 November 2009, in a further administrative realignment, Regulation Number 67 shifted the capital of Badung Regency from Denpasar to Mangupura.

==Geography==
Denpasar is located at an elevation of above sea level. While the total area of 125.98 km2 or 2.18% of the total area of Bali Province. From the use of land, 2,768 hectares of land are paddy, 10,001 hectares are dry land, while the remaining land area is 9 hectares.

Badung River divides Denpasar, after which the river empties into the Gulf of Benoa.

===Climate===
Denpasar, located just south of the equator, has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Aw&quot;) and is under the influence of the Australian monsoon system. Daytime temperatures typically range from 20°C to 33°C throughout the year. Between December and March, the West monsoon may bring heavy rain and high humidity, though days are generally sunny, with rain falling mainly at night and clearing quickly. From June to September, humidity is low, and evenings can be pleasantly cold.

==Demography==
The city&#x27;s population was counted as 788,445 in 2010, up from 533,252 in the previous decade. The official estimate as of mid-2022 was 726,808.

Denpasar&#x27;s population grew about 4% per year in the period from 2000 to 2010, Denpasar grew much faster from 2005 to 2010 than in the previous five years. The lingering effects of the 2002 Bali bombings had a major depressive effect on tourism, jobs, and immigration from other islands. If current trends had continued, Denpasar had been expected to easily surpass a million residents by the next census in 2020. The 2015 intercensal survey (SUPAS) claimed a population of 879,098 people for the city, but the 2020 Census demonstrated that the population had fallen to 725,314. There were some 7,098 more men than women in Denpasar in mid-2022.

Approximately 63.3% of the population are Hindus (BPS 2020), while Islam is the largest minority religion (28.65%), followed by Christianity (6.45%), Buddhism (1.47%), and Confucianism (0.03%).

==Administration==

Administratively, the city government consists of four districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), subdivided into 43 villages. Denpasar has developed numerous measures to improve public services.

===Districts===

Denpasar is divided into four districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), listed below with their officially estimated 2022 populations:
* Denpasar Selatan (South Denpasar) 217,548
* Denpasar Timur (East Denpasar) 128,540
* Denpasar Barat (West Denpasar) 207,384
* Denpasar Utara (North Denpasar) 173,336

===Greater Denpasar===
Greater Denpasar spills out into the tourist regions, including Kuta and Ubud. The continuous built-up area includes nearly all of Badung Regency (except Petang District), most of Gianyar Regency (except for Payangan, Tegallalang, and Tampaksiring Districts), and part of Tabanan Regency (Kediri and Tabanan Districts only). It is known as Sarbagita, a clipped compound of Denpa&quot;sar&quot;, &quot;Ba&quot;dung, &quot;Gi&quot;anyar, and &quot;Ta&quot;banan, made official by Presidential Regulation Number 45 of 2011, despite Tabanan just beginning to succumb to urban sprawl. See also List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia.

Notes: (a) Kuta Selatan, Kuta, Kuta Utara, Mengwi and Abiansemal Districts. (b) Sukawati, Blahbatuh, Ubud and Gianyar Districts. (c) Kediri and Tabanan Districts.

==Economy==
The development of tourism and structural changes in the economy have had a strong impact on Denpasar. Trade, hotels, and restaurants dominate the city&#x27;s gross regional domestic product.

Also boosting the economy of Denpasar is the production of craft items such as souvenir carvings and sculptures. The craft industry, however, is experiencing pressure due to the impact of the global financial crises and competition from other Asian developing countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, India, Malaysia, and China. These competitor countries maximize the scale of production by utilizing industrial technology, while at Denpasar the craft industry remains focused on traditional skills and hand-made goods, limiting the quantity of production.

==Architecture==

Bali was once known for its mud walls and thatched gates but gated residential developments and shop houses now characterize urban Bali.
During the late 19th century, the built environment was being constructed based on the political situation of the city. This resulted in the residence of the ruling family becoming the centre of the city.

Market squares played an important role in the Badung kingdom, and it continued to do so when the colonial powers came to exert control over Bali. Over the 20th century, Denpasar faced the challenges of changing urban landscapes brought about by political changes. The developments that were brought about by the colonial powers were regarded as eroding the indigenous culture of Bali. Although Denpasar became known as a &#x27;settler city&#x27;, there was still a strong attachment to the indigenous culture.

Denpasar has undergone massive unplanned development during the 21st century, due to the expansion of tourism leading to the construction of increasingly more modern facilities in the heart of the city. Nonetheless, the market square still plays an important role, with its façade representing traditional elements of the Balinese culture.

== Tourism ==
Denpasar has various attractions. The white sandy beaches are well-known all over the island. The surfing beach is Serangan Island. Sanur Beach has calmer waters and is excellent for sunbathing and kitesurfing.

Ten minutes from the Ngurah Rai International Airport lies the town of Kuta (within Badung Regency not administratively under the city jurisdiction), where most of the hotels, restaurants, malls, cafes, marketplaces, and spas that cater to tourists are located. In the Denpasar area, all kinds of Balinese handicrafts are represented in local shops. These include artwork, pottery, textiles, and silver. Batik cloth is sold all over Denpasar, and batik sarongs and men&#x27;s shirts are widely available.

==Education==
Denpasar has several notable universities and institutions. Some of them are
* Udayana University
* Warmadewa University
* University of National Education
* Dwijendra University
* Mahasaraswati University of Denpasar
* Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Denpasar
* Universitas Terbuka or Indonesia Open University, the only distance learning public university in Denpasar, providing distance education to its students.

==Transportation==

===Air===

The city is served by Ngurah Rai International Airport, one of the busiest in Indonesia.

===Sea===
Benoa Harbour is the entrance to the Denpasar by sea and is currently managed by PT Pelindo III. The port is located about 10 km from the city center, and has been operating since 1924.

===Land===
Public transport in Denpasar, especially for urban transportation, is becoming ineffective and inefficient, with only 30% of vehicles still in operation as of 2010. Public transport is not popular and is used by only about 3% of the total population. Meanwhile, the growth of private vehicle ownership is at 11% per year and is not comparable with the construction of new roads. Congestion in the city of Denpasar is unavoidable due to this reason.

Since August 2011, the city has operated a bus rapid transit system called Trans Sarbagita. Two main routes and some feeder lines are operated daily from 5 a.m. until 9 p.m. There is no dedicated lane for the buses: they run on main streets. In 2012 an average of 2,800 passengers per day used the service.

* Corridor 1 Kota–GWK
* Corridor 2 Kota–Nusa Dua

The central government&#x27;s Ministry of Transport initiated another system called Trans Metro Dewata on 7 September 2020. The system now serves 5 corridors, all also without separate lane, focusing more on the city.

* Corridor 1 (K1B): Sentral Parkir Kuta Badung – Terminal Pesiapan Tabanan
* Corridor 2 (K2B): GOR Ngurah Rai – Bandara Ngurah Rai
* Corridor 3 (K3B): Terminal Ubung – Pantai Matahari Terbit
* Corridor 4 (K4B): Terminal Ubung – Sentral Parkir Monkey Forest
* Corridor 5 (K5B): Sentral Parkir Kuta Badung–Terminal Ubung

Two major improvements to the road system were completed in 2013. In August, the underpass at the Dewa Ruci intersection was opened. It is slightly beyond the bounds of Denpasar but was co-financed by the town because of the expected positive effects on traffic in Denpasar.&lt;br&gt;Then the four-lane Bali Mandara Toll Road was opened on 1 October, connecting Benoa Harbor, Ngurah Rai Airport, and Nusa Dua.

==Sport==
Denpasar has hosted numerous international and national sporting events. Denpasar was the venue for the 2008 Asian Beach Games in Bali. Denpasar also held the 2009 Asian Archery Championships.

In football, Denpasar is home to the football club Perseden Denpasar, which plays in the Liga 3.

==Culture and sights==
While arts and culture in Denpasar are largely synonymous with Hindu art and culture, there has also been a high level of interaction with other cultures that accompanied the arrival of visitors from all walks of life. Traditional values inspired by Hindu religious rituals still strongly influence the city.

Traditional Balinese culture is still deeply rooted in Denpasar. It may include values, norms, and behavior in society based on patrilineal kinship systems. However, over time many of the customary laws have been disputed by people, especially regarding matters of gender and inheritance.

Denpasar has various sights to offer:
*&quot;Pura Jagatnatha&quot; is the most important Hindu temple of Denpasar. It was built in 1953.
*&quot;&quot; is the former royal palace of Denpasar, which was destroyed in a fire during the Dutch intervention in Bali (1906). The palace was rebuilt in a comparatively modest style and can be visited.
*&quot;Pura Maospahit&quot; is a Hindu temple that was built in the 14th century and was heavily damaged by the 1917 Bali earthquake and rebuilt afterward. The temple houses two impressive statues of Garuda and Batara Bayu, a mystic giant.
*&quot;Pura Pengerebongan &quot; is one of the Hindu temples in Denpasar whose existence is very strongly related to the history of the palace in Kesiman. The temple is located on Jalan WR. Supratman, Denpasar, has a unique history and traditional tradition, namely Ngerebong trance bulk which is held every Redite Pon Medangsia.
*&quot;St. Joseph Church&quot; is a Roman Catholic church built in a Hindu style.
*&quot;Bajra Sandhi Monument &quot;is a major landmark in Denpasar, set right in the centre of the Renon Square (otherwise locally referred to simply as, &#x27;Puputan Renon&#x27;). The site is adjacent to the Bali Governor&#x27;s office and is hard to miss with its grand structure that resembles a Balinese Hindu priest&#x27;s praying bell, or &#x27;bajra&#x27;. Inside the base is a museum that displays various historical dioramas of the people&#x27;s past struggle for independence.

===Museums===
The Bali Museum features Balinese art and history. The museum is built in the traditional Balinese style. There are four main buildings inside the museum, each with their unique specialization of exhibits.

<text>Bancroft () is a town located on the York River in Hastings County in the Canadian province of Ontario. It was first settled in the 1850s by descendants of the United Empire Loyalists and Irish immigrants. From the mid-1950s to about 1982, mining was the primary industry. A village until 1999, Bancroft then merged with Dungannon Township to form the Town of Bancroft. The population at the time of the 2021 Census was 4,065; the regional population is 60,000. There are 150,000 visitors to Bancroft, annually.

== History ==
By 1823, the government had purchased nearly two million acres of land from the Chippewa and Mississaga First Nations including a tract on the York River in Hastings County which had been established in 1792. The area was mapped in 1835 by explorer David Thompson.

The first family to build a cabin here, the Clarks in 1853, did so to take advantage of the fur trade. Early settlers included James Cleak and Alfred Barker from England who arrived in 1855, settling on Quarry Lake. They got jobs in administration; Cleak opened a small store and Barker became the first postmaster. Over the years the settlement grew quickly. In fact, there were 89 families by 1868. Lumber companies arrived to remove timber.

Some of the earliest settlers were United Empire Loyalists, but from 1856 to 1861, most were from Ireland, fleeing the problems caused by the Great Famine; many had farming experience and settled in the Township of Dungannon where the land was fertile. Most of the settlers were attracted to the area by the offer of free parcels that had been advertised in Great Britain. Some of the residents also sold furs, obtained through trapping.

Several colonization roads were built to the settlement in the 1850s70s, opening up the lands along the way to further settlement. The Hastings Road ran north. It was joined at Bancroft by the Mississippi Road running northwest from Plevna in Frontenac County and the Monck Road running west from Atherley on Lake Couchiching. This made Bancroft (then still known as York Mills) a significant crossroads.

The settlement had various names over the first years, York Mills, York River and York Branch. When the post office opened in 1861, it was called York River. A grist mill opened in 1865, gold was discovered in 1866 and other minerals would be discovered later. The discovery of sodalite by Frank Dawson Adams in 1892 led to the opening of he Princess Sodalite Mine. The first church and two schools were built in 1870. In 1879, the name of the settlement was changed to Bancroft by Senator Billa Flint, after the maiden name of his wife Elizabeth Ann Clement Bancroft. Flint convinced tradesmen to move to the area, which helped to attract more settlers. A woollen mill began operating in 1884.

The Central Ontario Railway arrived in 1900. In 1903, the Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway connected to the COR north of town at what is now Y Road, referring to the wye junction joining the two lines. They were beneficial in transporting settlers and goods; the railway would operate until 1982. Bancroft was incorporated as a village in December 1904. The first telephone in the village was at the railway station; it was connected in 1905. Electricity was not available until 1930.

Uranium was discovered in 1949 and construction of Faraday Mine started in 1952. The Red Cross Hospital opened in 1949. Faraday Mine was later renamed Madawaska Mine and operated until 1982. Other minerals were also mined over the years. The closing of the mine caused some economic hardship.

The Ontario Municipal Board approved a request for Bancroft village to become a town on August 9, 1995, with Bancroft Council bylaw 649-95 confirming the new status on 28 August 1995. In 1999, Bancroft merged with Dungannon Township to form the Town of Bancroft.

Paul Jenkins was elected as Mayor in the October 2018 municipal election. He was reelected in 2022.

== Housing ==
In 2021, Bancroft was ranked as the best place in Canada to buy real estate by &quot;MoneySense&quot;.

== Camping and hiking ==

=== Silent Lake Provincial Park ===
Nearby south on Highway 28 provides local camping opportunities. American sportsmen fished and hunted on this private lake for 40 years before it became a park. Silent Lake has a rocky and undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. A rugged trail circles the lake, and sections of groomed ski trails have been graded for mountain biking.

=== Algonquin Provincial Park ===
About an hour away on Highway 62 N - Highway 127 N - Highway 60 W, provides camping and hiking opportunities, beautiful forest and outdoor scenery. Portaging is quite common in this park. Algonquin offers many visitor attractions. Like Silent Lake, Algonquin has a rocky, treed and extensive undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. The OFSC trails through the park provide easy winter access by snowmobile.

One of the most common sights is the Canadian Moose.

=== Egan Chutes Provincial Park ===
Located 15 km east of Bancroft on highway 28. Egan Chutes Provincial Park is a nature reserve. The park is home to many local plants including Poplar, White Birch, Ash, Buffalo Berry, and Purple Flowering Raspberry. You can also find many different minerals including Nepheline, Blue Corundum, Zircon, Biotite, and Sodalite. Collecting of rocks and minerals are prohibited in the park. It is about a 10 to 20 minute hike. You can drive for the first 100m until you reach a parking lot, the access road is paved for another 200m. The rest of the hike is done on a dirt road, continue walking for another 10 to 15 minutes and you will come to a clearing where you will be standing at the top of the main waterfall - Egan Chute.

=== Eagle&#x27;s Nest Park ===
It is a scenic lookout in the town of Bancroft, Ontario. It is built on the top of a sheer rock face and overlooks the northern portions of the town, the York River and Bancroft Airport. It features the Hawkwatch Trail, capped by a large wooden platform that provides views out over the town. The trail passes the footings of a former fire watchtower.

=== Vance Farms Park ===
Located near the Bancroft hospital, on Oak street, this 37 acre hilly site was donated to the town of Bancroft in 1998 and opened in 2001. It features hiking and walking trails.

== Arts and events ==

In 2004, Bancroft won TVOntario&#x27;s &quot;Most Talented Town in Ontario&quot; contest. A large number of artists and artisans live in the surrounding area, and exhibit together in events like the &quot;Fall Studio Tour&quot;.

The Art Gallery of Bancroft hosts 11-12 exhibitions per year celebrating the work of local and regional artists and artisans. These exhibitions include the popular annual &quot;Juried Show&quot; and the annual student show displaying the work of four regional high schools. The gallery gift shop displays the paintings and fine crafts of area artists and the AGB boasts a permanent collection including some of Ontario&#x27;s finest artists.

&quot;A Place For the Arts&quot; is an artist&#x27;s cooperative and art gallery located in the town centre.

The town is home to the Village Playhouse, a theatre which has been hosting sold out plays, musicals and concerts since the early 1990s. Formerly the Bancroft Community Hall, the historical building was once the local jail, court house and library.

The annual Bancroft Rockbound Gemboree occurs in July and August.

== Transportation ==
Bancroft lies at the intersection of two provincial highways, Highway 28 and Highway 62, with several other inroads allowing access to the city.

Bancroft is served by the Jack Brown Airport, a Transport Canada Registered Aerodrome (CNW3), with a {{Convert|2,200|ft|m|adj=on}} crushed gravel runway, located immediately adjoining the town. A small airport, it was named after the man who was reeve at the time and instrumental in its construction. Currently operated by the Bancroft Flying Club, the Jack Brown Airport is freely available to the general public and frequently referred to as The Bancroft Airport. Due to high terrain near both ends of the runway, pilots typically use a non-standard circuit, following the York River valley through the town for departing from runway 12 or landing on runway 30.

The Central Ontario Railway arrived in November 1900, connecting Bancroft with Trenton. The railway went through the Musclow-Greenview road and extended behind Birds Creek through a back trail (which is now used for cyclists and four wheeling) and continued through the town eventually going further away from the town at the &#x27;Y&#x27; road division. The line was closed in 1975 and subsequently removed. The Bancroft, Irondale and Ottawa Railway connected Bancroft with Kinmount, Ontario. The line was purchased by the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway which became part of the Canadian National Railways in 1918. The line was abandoned in 1960.

The old train station in Bancroft served as the Chamber of Commerce and Mineral Museum until it was condemned in 2008. The Chamber, Mineral Museum, and Art Gallery relocated to other sites in the town. In 2011, the old station was moved onto a new foundation; it is now restored with an addition at the southern end of the building to house the Bancroft Gem and Mineral Club&#x27;s museum and a caboose, which is not currently in use.

<text>A spoiler is an element of a disseminated summary or description of a media narrative that reveals significant plot elements, with the implication that the experience of discovering the plot naturally, as the creator intended it, has been robbed (&quot;spoiled&quot;) of its full effect. Typically, the conclusion of a plot, including the climax and ending, is regarded as highly susceptible to spoilers. Plot twists are also prone to spoilers. Any narrative medium can produce spoilers, although they are usually associated with movies and television shows. Some people attempt to avoid being &quot;spoiled&quot; while others seek out spoilers to learn as much as possible about a narrative before experiencing it. Spoilers have become more common in the present day with the rise of social media, which provides an outlet for people to spread spoilers.

There are three types of spoilers: short spoilers, long spoilers, and thematic spoilers. Short spoilers reveal the plot ending in a very brief and less detailed manner, without any summary or explanation of themes in the story, typically spanning one to three sentences. Long spoilers usually provide more context and range between two and five sentences. They provide a summary and reveal the ending of a story. Lastly, thematic spoilers reveal a story&#x27;s unifying theme as well as providing a synopsis of the plot and revealing the ending. They range from three to six sentences in length. The general consensus is that there are only negative effects of spoilers. However, research shows that it is short and long spoilers that can cause negative effects, while thematic spoilers generally have a positive effect.

==History==
The first print use of the term &quot;spoiler&quot; with its modern meaning was in the April 1971 issue of &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, in which the article &quot;Spoilers,&quot; by Doug Kenney, revealed the endings of famous films and novels. Kenney wrote, &quot;Spoilers! What are they? Simply the trick ending to every mystery novel and movie you&#x27;re ever liable to see. Saves time and money!&quot;

The term first appeared on the Internet in 1979 before becoming common in Usenet newsgroups by the late 1980s. According to the rules of netiquette, spoilers should be preceded by a warning of some kind. Sometimes, these warnings are omitted, accidentally or deliberately, resulting in unwitting readers having literature, films, television programs, and other works that they were looking forward to experiencing spoiled.

==Website policies and features==

Wikipedia discloses spoilers in its articles without giving advance warning. Mathew Prichard criticized Wikipedia for presenting spoilers for his grandmother&#x27;s play &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;. Andrew Jarecki argued that Wikipedia should have spoiler alerts; the ending of &quot;Catfish&quot;, a documentary he had produced, was posted on Wikipedia before its theatrical release because the film was shown at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Jay Walsh, a Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson, said that Wikipedia is meant to be an exhaustive knowledge source and thus must contain spoilers.

Certain websites employ spoiler formatting, allowing certain details to be hidden inline with text, which the user may reveal by mousing over, highlighting or clicking the text. Websites that make use of Markdown formatting, such as Discord and Reddit, have allows for syntax extensions such as or ; websites which use a rich-text editor allow for inline formatting in this style.

On Usenet, the common method for obscuring spoiler information is to precede it with many blank lines known as &#x27;spoiler space&#x27; – traditionally enough to push the information in question on to the next screen of a 25-line terminal. A simple cipher called ROT13 is also used in newsgroups to obscure spoilers, but is rarely used for this purpose elsewhere.

Most discussion websites provide a means of tagging certain threads as containing spoilers for those who wish to discuss a fictional work in depth, including the outcomes of events and the handling of the narrative resolution. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Tumblr allow posts to be given hashtags, allowing users to avoid certain spoiler discussions by making use of a blacklist. Due to the ad-lib methodology of tagging, however, this is imperfect and open to false positives and false negatives.

Some have felt compelled to avoid participating on public websites altogether, set up &quot;closed&quot; websites to exclude those who are sensitive about spoilers, or decided they had to unilaterally blog at the expense of public exchange.

==Psychological effect==
===Positive effects===
In 2011, Nicholas Christenfeld and Jonathan Leavitt of UC San Diego did a psychological experiment testing whether spoilers diminish enjoyment of fiction. They gave subjects short stories with twist endings to read, giving some of the subjects information about the twist in advance. For nearly every story, subjects who had the story &quot;spoiled&quot; enjoyed the story more than the subjects who did not know the ending in advance.

The spoiling of James Holzhauer&#x27;s loss on &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, which was reported upon by both print and Internet sources hours before it aired on most of the show&#x27;s stations, had a somewhat unexpectedly positive impact on that episode&#x27;s ratings. Instead of ruining the outcome, the spoilers had teased just enough to encourage viewers to tune in to see how the previously dominant Holzhauer was beaten. &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; does not contractually require its audience members to remain silent in regard to spoilers; members have generally followed the honor system in not leaking spoilers before episodes air.

Although many avoid spoilers to prevent the possibility of decreased enjoyment, research does suggest that spoilers can increase enjoyment for viewers under certain criteria. One is mood management, in which spoilers can function as &quot;non cognitive desensitization strategy and a cognitive coping strategy.&quot; Instead of spoilers inducing positive feelings, those who engage with spoilers may so as a protective measure. They can insulate viewers from negative feelings by giving a sense of preparedness or time for viewers to process such information before they actually view it. Those who report that spoilers have increased enjoyment for them while engaging in media typically either actively seek this information as a division to ease anxiety or happen across a favorable spoiler.

Those who enjoy spoilers, or feel that spoilers increase their enjoyment while viewing, entail different criteria of focus and for assessment. Another criterion in assessing how spoilers may enhance enjoyment for viewers is curiosity. Viewers may feel anxiety-ridden or impatient is the face of cliffhangers or potential plot twists, in which seeing spoilers were ways to overcome these &quot;gaps&quot; in viewership.

In light of media conglomeration, spoilers are becoming harder to avoid for viewers. In this way, viewers who state they embrace spoilers find enjoyment, find normalcy in spoilers, and now focus on the aesthetic elements rather than the overall plot. Knowing the end of a TV show, book, movie, etc., is perceived by viewers who embrace spoilers as only a marginal component for their enjoyment. Viewers may know the ending, but not the process in which the ways things occur or how they specifically happen.

===Negative effects===
Many feel spoilers irrevocably diminish suspense, speculation, shock value, and the unique experience of organically discovering a narrative. The unpredictable journey is damaged if outcomes are known ahead of time.

Similar to Christenfeld and Leavitt, in 2015, Benjamin Johnson and Judith Rosenbaum conducted an experiment to examine the impact of spoiler reveals on enjoyment. However, instead of short spoilers, the subjects were presented with thematic spoilers. To assess the enjoyment, Johnson and Rosenbaum employed a multi-item measure, utilizing a 12-item enjoyment questionnaire, in contrast to Christenfeld&#x27;s and Leavitt&#x27;s use of a single-item measure of enjoyment. Their research revealed that, when exposed to thematic spoilers, more subjects reported findings of the stories to be less enjoyable due to their revealing nature. When confronted with a spoiler, it reduces one&#x27;s ability to individually process and hinders their critical thinking skills about a given story. Therefore, spoilers may then diminish the motivation necessary to experience a work at all if the resolution has been revealed.

Additionally, research conducted by Dr. Kevin Autry, Dr. William H. Levine and Michelle Betzer found that enjoyment was reduced when spoilers were introduced, particularly within short stories. Their experiment had differed from Christenfeld and Leavitt&#x27;s in that it featured even shorter spoilers and focused mainly on the story&#x27;s end and its twist.

==Reactions==
===Writers and directors===
The end credits to Henri-Georges Clouzot&#x27;s 1955 film &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; includes a card with an early anti-spoiler message from the director:

Similarly, Alfred Hitchcock asked audiences not to reveal the ending of his 1960 thriller &quot;Psycho&quot;, saying &quot;Please don&#x27;t give away the ending, it&#x27;s the only one we have.&quot;

In an interview about his &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series (appearing in issue #4 of the 2007 Marvel Comic adaptation &quot;The Gunslinger Born&quot;), Stephen King was asked if there are spoilers in the first few novels that would ruin someone&#x27;s experience of the comic. &quot;There are no spoilers!&quot;, King replied, &quot;You might as well say &#x27;I&#x27;m never gonna watch &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; again because I know how it comes out&#x27;&quot;. Later, in 2014, King was widely criticized for revelling in a major character&#x27;s demise in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; on Twitter, only moments after the episode&#x27;s airing, thus revealing a plot twist for non-live and offshore audiences. King responded by commenting the end of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and the death of the eponymous protagonists. He echoed the incident in a talk with the author and screenplay writer of the scene, George R. R. Martin in 2016, summing it up as &quot;You can&#x27;t spoil a book!&quot;, followed by impromptu plot revelations for seminal works, including &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.

In April 2015, the Under the Gun Theater created &quot;Swarm of Spoilers&quot;, a parody show based on George R.R. Martin&#x27;s &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; series. The comedic play recapped the previous four seasons of the HBO television show. Kevin Mullaney, who directed &quot;Swarm of Spoilers&quot;, stated: &quot;I&#x27;m somebody who&#x27;s very sensitive about spoilers, so I wanted to make sure it was very clear from the title,&quot; though he went on to say, &quot;There&#x27;s actually this theory about spoilers that we think that they hurt the enjoyment of shows, and I definitely feel that way sometimes, but I think there&#x27;s been studies that show the other side: that when we know the ending of a story that we haven&#x27;t read before, it actually enhances the story, so I don&#x27;t know if it would actually hurt anyone to come see it [&quot;Swarm of Spoilers&quot;].&quot; The final production included 45 of the series&#x27; characters, and was played by an 18-person ensemble.

===Film studios===
Some producers actively plant bogus information in order to misdirect fans. The director of the film &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot; orchestrated a &quot;disinformation campaign&quot; where false spoilers were distributed about the film, to mask any true rumors about its plot.

The market campaigns for Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;&quot; and its sequel &quot;&quot; extensively promoted the maintenance of secrecy regarding the films&#x27; plots, with the latter&#x27;s social media campaign including a hashtag (#DontSpoilTheEndgame), a signed letter from the Russo brothers and a video featuring the film&#x27;s ensemble cast demanding that earlier viewers of the film refrain from spoiling the plot.

===Film critics===

In 2005, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert wrote an article entitled &quot;Critics have no right to play spoiler&quot; which contained spoilers and spoiler warnings. Ebert wrote:

:&quot;The characters in movies do not always do what we would do. Sometimes they make choices that offend us. That is their right. It is our right to disagree with them. It is not our right, however, to destroy for others the experience of being as surprised by those choices as we were. A few years ago, I began to notice &quot;spoiler warnings&quot; on Web-based movie reviews -- a shorthand way of informing the reader that a key plot point was about to be revealed. Having heard from more than a few readers accusing me of telling too much of the story, I began using such warnings in my reviews.&quot;

Ebert used two spoiler warnings in the article, saying &quot;If you have not yet seen &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; and know nothing about the plot, read no further&quot; and later said, &quot;Now yet another spoiler warning, because I am going to become more explicit.&quot; Ebert discussed six films in the article and mentioned how many critics handled &quot;The Crying Game&quot; and also noted a detail about the film &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot;. Ebert also mentioned two films alongside &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;.

Ebert additionally criticized two commentators, Rush Limbaugh and Michael Medved (the latter of whom had &quot;for a long time been a political commentator, not a movie critic&quot;), for deliberately revealing the ending of the movie due to a moral disagreement with the lead character&#x27;s life decision. &quot;[S]hould no movie be allowed to consider [the moral issue]?&quot; Ebert asked. &quot;The separation of church and state in America was wisely designed to prevent religions from dictating the personal choices of those who do not share the same beliefs.&quot;

===Artists===
In an art exhibition at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Monterrey (Mexico), artist Mario García Torres presented a series of works titled &quot;Ruining Paintings&quot;, in which spoilers of various films were written on large color canvases.

<doc id="542705" wikidata="Q558044" url="?curid=542705" title="Jens Bjørneboe">
<text>Jens Ingvald Bjørneboe (9 October 1920 – 9 May 1976) was a Norwegian writer whose work spanned a number of literary formats. He was also a painter and a Waldorf school teacher. Bjørneboe was a harsh and eloquent critic of Norwegian society and Western civilization as a whole. He led a turbulent life and his uncompromising opinions cost him both an obscenity conviction as well as long periods of heavy drinking and bouts of depression, which in the end led to his suicide.

Jens Bjørneboe&#x27;s first published work was &quot;Poems&quot; (&quot;Dikt&quot;) in 1951. He is widely considered to be one of Norway&#x27;s most important post-war authors. Bjørneboe identified himself, among other self-definitions, as an anarcho-nihilist.

During the Norwegian language struggle, Bjørneboe was a notable proponent of the Riksmål language, together with his equally famous cousin André Bjerke.

== Early life ==
Jens Bjørneboe was born in 1920, in Kristiansand to Ingvald and Anna Marie Bjørneboe. He grew up in a wealthy family, his father a shipping magnate and a consul for Belgium. The Bjørneboe family originally immigrated from Germany in the 17th century and later adopted their Norwegian name. Coming from a long line of marine officers, Bjørneboe also went to sea as a young man.

Bjørneboe had a troubled childhood with sickness and depressions. He was bedbound for several years following severe pneumonia. At thirteen he attempted suicide by hanging himself. He began drinking when he was twelve, and he would often consume large amounts of wine when his parents were away. It is also rumored that he drank his father&#x27;s aftershave on several occasions.

In 1943 Bjørneboe fled to Sweden to avoid forced labor under the Nazi occupation. During this exile, he met the German Jewish painter Lisel Funk, who later became his first wife. Lisel Funk introduced him to many aspects of German culture, especially German literature and the arts.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Bjørneboe reinvigorated the Norwegian anarchist movement with essays such as &quot;Anarkismen som fremtid&quot; (&quot;Anarchism as Future&quot;) and &quot;Anarkismen ... i dag?&quot; (&quot;Anarchism ... Today?&quot;).

== Death and legacy ==
After having struggled with depression and alcoholism for a long time, he committed suicide by hanging on the island of Veierland on 9 May 1976.

In his obituary in &quot;Aftenposten&quot;, Bjørneboe&#x27;s life and legacy were described as follows:

For 25 years Jens Bjørneboe was a center of unrest in Norwegian cultural life: Passionately concerned with contemporary problems in nearly all their aspects, controversial and with the courage to be so, with a conscious will to carry things to extremes. He was not to be pigeonholed. He dropped in on many philosophical and political movements, but couldn&#x27;t settle down in any of them. He was a wanderer, always traveling on in search of what was for him the truth—and he was a free man, in that he always ruthlessly followed his innermost intentions. Perhaps he could say, like Søren Kierkegaard, that &quot;subjectivity is truth,&quot; for he knew no other guide than his personal conviction and his own impulses—but he related not merely to himself; his deepest concern was society and the person in society. His subjective grasp always involved the totality.

<text>Zak Spears, (born January 15, 1965) is an American gay pornographic film actor. Spears appeared in the feature film &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; (1995) using his real name, Khristofor Rossianov.

Spears also appeared in the black comedy feature film &quot;Forgiving the Franklins&quot; (2006) under the name Khris Scaramanga. The film&#x27;s director, Jay Floyd, said that having Spears in his film helped raise its profile. &quot;I have one star in my movie,&quot; Floyd told &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;. &quot;He just happens to be a porn star.&quot;

Initially retiring from the industry in 1996, he made a return in 2004 in the film &quot;Zak Attack&quot;, sporting a dramatic image change which included a shaved head and a much bulkier build.

<doc id="542710" wikidata="Q1809340" url="?curid=542710" title="M32 motorway">
<text>The M32 is a motorway in South Gloucestershire and Bristol, England. It provides a link from the M4, a major motorway linking London and South Wales, to Bristol city centre and is maintained by National Highways, the national roads body.

The motorway was planned concurrently with the M4 in the 1960s, and construction was complete to Eastville in northeast Bristol by 1970. The southernmost section was delayed by engineering challenges and industrial action, and did not open until 1975. Since the mid-2000s, there have been plans to use the M32 as part of a park and ride facility which would reduce congestion in Bristol.

Though the M32 has a small traffic flow, it is one of the most congested motorways in the region as it connects a number of key areas. As well as providing one of the few high-quality routes into the centre of Bristol, it is the only significant link from the M4 to the A4174 Bristol Ring Road. Parts of the M32 are reaching the end of their intended lifespan, leading to reduced speed limits and occasional closures for remedial work. Local residents have criticised the M32, complaining that it has severed communities and has an unacceptable noise level.

The M32 is long. Its northern end is at junction 19 of the M4, near Winterbourne Down. Originally a grade separated roundabout junction, it was modified in 1992 to remove conflicting traffic movements in order to increase capacity.

The motorway then runs south between Filton in the west and Frenchay in the east. After meeting the A4174 ring road at junction 1, it crosses the boundary from South Gloucestershire to Bristol, passing to the east of Horfield, Lockleaze and Easton. Junction 2, next to Eastville Park, meets the B4469 providing access to Horfield. Midway through, a speed limit begins. The motorway continues further south and ends just beyond junction 3, north of St Paul&#x27;s. A dual carriageway continues as the A4032 into the centre of Bristol, with a speed limit.

The M32 is a trunk road, therefore its maintenance and upkeep is paid for by National Highways, the national roads authority. Most of the road has two lanes in each direction, though an extended sliproad north of junction 2 provides a climbing lane, and the short section between junction 1 and the M4 has three lanes both ways.

==History==
===Construction===

The M32 was planned to be a key radial link through to the hub of a network of radial and ring roads within a rectangle encompassing Bristol. Other bounds of this scheme were parts of the M4 (north eastern side), the M5 (north western side) and the tidal reaches of the River Avon (south western side), the south eastern side not being defined by landmarks. The motorway was partly funded by Gloucestershire County Council and Bristol City Council, with a 75 per cent grant supplied by the national Ministry of Transport. It was provisionally called the Hambrook Spur or the Bristol Parkway during construction, and was built in three distinct stages between 1966 and 1975.

The first section, from the M4 to junction 1, opened concurrently with that motorway in September 1966. The second section, through to junction 2, was a co-operative design between the Gloucestershire county surveyor and the design consultants Freeman Fox &amp; Partners. Construction was awarded to Sir Robert McAlpine, who began work in June 1968. The northern section was designed as a full-speed () motorway as far as Eastville, after which the motorway ran on an elevated section with a lower design standard. This section was opened by the Secretary of State for Transport, John Peyton in July 1970. The total cost was £3million (now £million). In 1972, a polystyrene storage depot on Muller Road near junction 2 caught fire, leading to the closure of the southbound M32 for six days.

The third section was the most technically demanding, as it ran through heavily built-up urban areas and required numerous properties to be demolished, along with the &quot;Thirteen-arch viaduct&quot; near Stapleton Road that was built in 1874. Work was delayed owing to the Three-Day Week industrial action in 1974, and further because of a national builders&#x27; strike. During construction, the Local Government Act 1972 was passed, and responsibility passed to the newly created Avon County Council in April 1974. This section, and hence the full extent of the motorway, was opened to traffic in May 1975. The cost was reported to be £10.4million (now £million).

===Bus improvements===
A bus lane, constructed in 2008 on the southbound carriageway of the A4032, Newfoundland Way, links the end of the M32 at junction 3 with Cabot Circus. It starts just north of junction 3 and runs for around , adjacent to the central reservation, and becomes a general running lane for its final to a signal controlled junction. The hard shoulder and the remaining width of carriageway were rebuilt as two narrowed running lanes for general traffic, and the speed limit was reduced to .

In 2009, the council announced that a park and ride facility would be developed next to the M32 to help alleviate congestion in the city centre. The project was expected to create 1,500 parking spaces and cost £191million. In 2015, construction began on a bus-only junction between junctions 1 and 2, on land partly allocated to the Stapleton Allotments and near the Stoke Park estate. The project is part of the North Fringe to Hengrove MetroBus rapid transit route package, and involves creating new slip roads, a connecting route to Stoke Lane and a new bridge over the M32 to be completed by mid-2016. The bridge was lifted into place in June, which required closing the M32 to all traffic.

==Traffic==
The M32 is a relatively lightly trafficked route compared to neighbouring motorways such as the M4 and M5, yet has still been described in the West of England Combined Authority&#x27;s Joint Transport Plan as &quot;by far, the busiest road corridor into Bristol.&quot; In 2001, the average daily traffic flow was 40,400 vehicles northbound and 39,900 southbound, while in 2014, the combined flow for both directions averaged 75,000 vehicles. Despite this, the M32 is frequently congested as it is a popular route into the centre of Bristol. During the morning rush hour, queues can tail back onto the motorway from the city centre. In 2014, the Highways Agency reported that the M32 between junctions 1 and 2 was the most unreliable motorway journey along the entire M4 corridor between London and South Wales, with over 56 per cent of journeys taking longer than predicted. The problem is exacerbated whenever there is an incident on the M4 around Bristol, as drivers attempt to use the M32 as a diversion route, creating further traffic and congestion.

The M32 forms a bottleneck at its northern end as it is the only link between the M4 and the A4174 Bristol Ring Road. In 2015, Chris Skidmore, Member of Parliament for Kingswood, launched the Gateway2Growth campaign, which would see a new road running from the M4 at Emersons Green to the A4174.

Highways England were concerned that the M32, especially its elevated sections, will reach its planned end-of-life around 2020. Urgent works were recommended on the Eastville Viaduct in particular, which had deficient surfacing, barriers and lighting. A speed limit was placed along the viaduct, while surveying work was carried out in 2016 during the Metrobus junction refurbishments.

==Community and environment==

The M32 has been criticised for severing longstanding links in Bristol. Older residents have claimed that formerly close-knit communities such as Easton have been shut off by the imposing concrete barriers next to the motorway. It has been criticised for running through the grounds of Stoke Park, spoiling the local atmosphere and requiring part of the estate including the Duchess Pond to be demolished. In 2008, Jeremy Isaacs claimed the motorway was a reason that Bristol did not win the European Capital of Culture award that year, adding that the M32 had created a &quot;concrete divide&quot; between Eastville, St Paul&#x27;s and Easton.

Local residents have complained about the noise on the M32. A report by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs showed that traffic noise can be as loud as 75decibels in neighbouring estates. In 2014, a petition was created to campaign Bristol City Council to install quieter road surfaces and noise barriers along the motorway.

In 2011, a council gardening scheme created a horticultural landscape next to the southern end of the M32. The project included planting of red poppies, cornflowers, and marigolds. A spokesman said they hoped it would enhance the view from the motorway and provide additional habitats for wildlife including bees and butterflies. The gardens were well received by locals and led to a city-wide project called Meadow Bristol, to grow similar meadows elsewhere.

In 2021, the Government proposed reducing the speed limit where it is still to to reduce the quantity of nitrogen dioxide emissions along the road.

<text>Stepney Green is a London Underground station located on Mile End Road in Stepney, London, United Kingdom. It is between Whitechapel and Mile End on the District line and the Hammersmith &amp; City line, and is in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==
The station was opened in 1902 by the Whitechapel and Bow Railway, a joint venture between the District Railway and the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. The new railway connected the District Railway at Whitechapel with the London, Tilbury and Southend at Bow.

Electrified District Railway services started in 1905. Hammersmith and City line services (then part of the Metropolitan line) started in 1936. The station passed to London Underground in 1950.

The Hammersmith &amp; City line was extended from Whitechapel to Barking via Stepney Green permanently in 2009 due to Crossrail and work at Whitechapel station.

==Design==
It is a sub-surface station with two platforms. The ticket office is above ground and connected to the platforms by stairs. The layout and design of the station is largely unchanged with many original features intact.
==Services==

===Hammersmith &amp; City line===
This is the general off-peak frequency.

*6 tph eastbound to Barking
*6 tph westbound to Hammersmith via King&#x27;s Cross and Wood Lane

===District line===

This is the general off-peak frequency. During peak times trains also operate to Wimbledon. During off-peak times, 3 trains per hour from Wimbledon terminate at Barking (as of December 2014).

*12 tph eastbound to (On Sundays alternate trains run to Barking only)
*3 tph eastbound to Barking
*6 tph westbound to Ealing Broadway
*6 tph westbound to Richmond
*3 tph westbound to Wimbledon

===Circle line===
There is no regular service however there are two trains per day that run from Barking to Edgware Road via Victoria before 6 AM. (as of February 2015.)

*2 tpd westbound to Edgware Road via Victoria

==Location==
Stepney Green is one of the two stations (the other being Mile End) serving the nearby Mile End campus of Queen Mary, University of London, with a station located each side of it.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 25, 205, 309 and night routes N25 and N205 serve the station.

<text>Ambrose Dixon (1619 – April 12, 1687) was an early American Quaker pioneer who was born in England and emigrated to America at an early age where he lived in the Virginia Colony before moving to Maryland.
==Background==
Dixon married Mary, the widow of Henry Peddington, between July 4, and October 28, 1647. It has been stated that her maiden name was Wilson.

In 1651, Dixon joined Colonel Edmund Scarburgh and others in riding against the Indians in defiance of the law. A Court Order of 10 May 1651 says:

He was a Quaker and had moved to Somerset County, Maryland, by January 4, 1663, to escape religious persecution. His home became the first Quaker meeting house in Maryland.

On January 4, 1666, he was appointed Surveyor for Highways. He was elected on March 3, 1671, he was elected a delegate in the Maryland Assembly representing Annemessex, Maryland. He never attended.

He died in 1687 at his plantation, Dixon&#x27;s Choice. He is the immigrant ancestor to thousands of Americans including the Indiana blacksmith Noah Beauchamp who murdered his neighbor in the 1840s.

<text>Mile End is a London Underground station in Mile End, London. It is located in Travelcard Zone 2 and is served by three lines: Central, District and Hammersmith &amp; City. On the Central line, the station is between Bethnal Green and Stratford stations. On the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, it is between Stepney Green and Bow Road stations. This station features a cross-platform interchange in both directions; District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines stop on the inside tracks, and the Central line stops on the outside tracks. 

==History==
The station was opened on 2 June 1902 by the Whitechapel &amp; Bow Railway (W&amp;BR). Electrified services started in 1905. The first services were provided by the District Railway (now the District line); the Metropolitan line followed in 1936 (In 1988 this section of the Metropolitan was renamed the Hammersmith &amp; City line). In 1946, the station was expanded and rebuilt by the Chief Architect of London Underground, Stanley Heaps and his assistant Thomas Bilbow, as part of the Central line eastern extension, with services starting on 4 December 1946. Following nationalisation of the joint venture owners of the W&amp;BR, full ownership of the station passed to London Underground in 1950.

During the development of the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in the 1980s, it was to be a tram system. The preferred northern option was to run the DLR along Mile End Road towards a terminus at Mile End tube station. However the Stratford route was picked and the system became a light metro instead.

The station has undergone renovation in 2007. Metronet, a company in a public–private partnership with Transport for London (TfL), got as far as stripping the station bare before the company collapsed in 2008. After a short changeover period, TfL continued the renovation work.

On 5 July 2007, a Central line train was derailed when it hit a roll of fire blanket, which had been blown out of a cross-passage between the two tunnels by the strong crosswinds.

In November 2009, part of a plastic barrier broke off from a departing Central line train and struck three commuters. One woman suffered a cut in her forehead, and London Underground Ltd faced a fine of up to £20,000 after admitting liability in the case.

==Design and layout==
Mile End is the only station in a tunnel on the Tube network that offers cross-platform interchange between deep level tube (Central line) and sub-surface (District and Hammersmith &amp; City line) trains. The station takes its name from the A11 Mile End Road, which itself is named after a milestone marking the point east of the boundary of the City of London. However, the stone&#x27;s position was actually closer to Stepney Green than Mile End station itself, which is further east, on the junction with Burdett Road.

==Notable local places==

The station is close to Victoria Park and Mile End Park, as well as the Regent&#x27;s Canal. Queen Mary University of London, Mile End Hospital and the now-closed St. Clements Hospital—part of the Royal London Hospital—are nearby.

==Connections==
The station is served by London Buses daytime and night routes.
