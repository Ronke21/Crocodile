<text>USS &quot;Chester&quot; (CL/CA-27), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy named after the city of Chester, Pennsylvania.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Chester&quot; was launched on 3 July 1929 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey; sponsored by Miss J. T. Blain; commissioned on 24 June 1930, Captain Arthur Fairfield in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet.

==Inter-war period==
&quot;Chester&quot; cleared Newport, Rhode Island, on 13 August 1930 for an extensive European cruise. She visited Barcelona, Naples, Constantinople, Phaleron Bay, and Gibraltar before returning to Chester, Pennsylvania, for voyage repairs on 13 October. She joined the Scouting Fleet as flagship for Commander, Light Cruiser Divisions, and on 6 March 1931, embarked the Secretary of the Navy for the Canal Zone where he observed the annual fleet problem from . &quot;Chester&quot; carried the secretary back to Miami, Fla., arriving on 22 March, then sailed to Narragansett Bay for exercises and duty escorting two visiting French cruisers.

Originally classified as a light cruiser, CL-27, because of her thin armor, &quot;Chester&quot; was redesignated a heavy cruiser, CA-27, because of her 8-inch guns in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930, effective 1 July 1931.

Following an overhaul at New York Navy Yard during which she was equipped with two catapults amidships, &quot;Chester&quot; stood out of Hampton Roads on 31 July 1932 with planes and ammunition for the West Coast. She arrived at San Pedro, Los Angeles, on 14 August and joined in the regular activities of the fleet. Departing San Pedro on 9 April 1934 as flagship of Commander, Special Service Squadron, she arrived in New York on 31 May for that day&#x27;s Presidential Naval Review, returning to San Pedro on 9 November. Ensign Richard O&#x27;Kane, who would win the Medal of Honor as the most successful United States submarine officer of World War II, served aboard &quot;Chester&quot; for one year as a junior gun division officer and then as signal officer following graduation from the United States Naval Academy in 1934. On 25 September 1935, &quot;Chester&quot; embarked the Secretary of War and his party for a voyage to the Philippines in connection with the inauguration of the president of the Philippines Commonwealth on 15 November. Returning to San Francisco on 14 December 1935, she resumed operations with Cruiser Division 4.

Sailing from San Francisco on 28 October 1936, &quot;Chester&quot; arrived at Charleston, South Carolina, on 13 November and departed five days later to escort with President Franklin Roosevelt embarked for a good-will visit to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Montevideo, Uruguay. &quot;Chester&quot; returned to San Pedro on 24 December.

&quot;Chester&quot; remained on the West Coast for fleet exercises and training cruises to Hawaiian and Alaskan waters from 1937 except for a cruise to the East Coast for exercises and overhaul (23 September 1940 – 21 January 1941). &quot;Chester&quot; was one of six ships to receive the new RCA CXAM radar in 1940.

Home-ported at Pearl Harbor from 3 February, the cruiser exercised in Hawaiian waters, and made one voyage to the West Coast with Commander, Scouting Force embarked (14 May 1941 – 18 June 1941). From 10 October to 13 November, she escorted two army transports carrying reinforcements to Manila, Philippines Islands. Upon her return, she joined and and was at sea returning from Wake Island when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.

==World War II==
&quot;Chester&quot; remained on patrol with Task Force 8 (TF 8) in Hawaiian waters. On 12 December, her planes bombed a submarine, then guided to a depth charge attack which continued until contact was lost.

===1942===
&quot;Chester&quot; supported the reinforcement landing on Samoa (18–24 January 1942), then joined Task Group 8.3 (TG 8.3) commanded by Adm. William Halsey for the successful raid on Taroa (1 February). Retiring under heavy air attack, she received a bomb hit in the well deck which killed eight and injured 38. The &quot;Chester&quot; was the only surface ship to lose men in the first surface attack of the Pacific war. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 3 February for repairs.

Following an escort voyage to San Francisco, &quot;Chester&quot; joined TF 17 for the Guadalcanal-Tulagi raid (4 May); the attack on Misima Island, Louisiade Archipelago (7 May); and the Battle of the Coral Sea (8 May) during which her steady antiaircraft fire protected the carriers providing the air strikes which stopped the invasion force heading for Port Moresby, New Guinea. Five of &quot;Chester&quot;″s crew were wounded in this encounter. On 10 May, she received 478 survivors of from , whom she transferred to Tonga Island on 15 May.

After a West Coast overhaul, &quot;Chester&quot; arrived at Nouméa on 21 September 1942, to join TF 62 for the landings on Funafuti, Ellice Islands (2–4 October). She then proceeded south and while cruising in support of the operations in the Solomons, specifically north of the New Hebrides Islands, &quot;Chester&quot; was hit by a torpedo from on the starboard side, amidships on 20 October which killed 11 and wounded 12. She returned to Espiritu Santo under her own power for emergency repairs on 23 October. Three days later, struck a mine, and &quot;Chester&quot; sent fire and rescue parties to her aid as well as embarking 440 survivors from the fleet tug for transfer to Espiritu Santo. She steamed to Sydney, Australia, on 29 October for further repairs and on Christmas Day, departed for Norfolk and a complete overhaul.

===1943===
Returning to San Francisco on 13 September 1943, &quot;Chester&quot; operated on escort duty between that port and Pearl Harbor until 20 October. On 8 November, she cleared Pearl Harbor for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. On 18–20 November, after air attacks, destroyers and cruisers bombarded Tarawa. Chester was the lead ship and received some accurate fire from the beach the first two days. The &quot;Chester&quot;, along with the rest of the division, also bombarded Apemoma, another of the Gilberts. She covered the landings on Abemama Island and bombarded Taroa, Wotje, and Maloelap.

===1944===
&quot;Chester&quot; assumed antisubmarine and antiaircraft patrol off Majuro until 25 April 1944, when she sailed for San Francisco and brief overhaul (6–22 May). She joined TF 94 at Adak Island, Alaska, on 27 May for the bombardments of Matsuwa and Paramushiru in the Kuriles on 13 June and 26 June, then sailed to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 13 August. Captain Henry Hartley assumed command at the time.

&quot;Chester&quot; sortied on 29 August with TG 12.5 for the bombardment of Wake Island (3 September), then arrived at Eniwetok on 6 September. She cruised off Saipan and participated in the bombardment of Marcus Island on 9 October, before joining TG 38.1 for the carrier strikes on Luzon and Samar in support of the Leyte operations, as well as searching for enemy forces after the Battle for Leyte Gulf (25–26 October).

===1945===
From 8 November 1944 to 21 February 1945, &quot;Chester&quot; operated from Ulithi and Saipan in bombardment of Iwo Jima and the Bonins, supporting the invasion landings of 19 February.

After another West Coast overhaul, &quot;Chester&quot; returned to Ulithi on 21 June, and conducted patrols off Okinawa from 27 June, as well as covering minesweeping operations west of the island. In late July, &quot;Chester&quot; was assigned to the force supplying air cover for the Coast Striking Group (TG 95.2) off the Yangtze River Delta and protecting minesweeping. In August, she made a voyage to the Aleutians, and on the last day of the month sailed to participate in the occupation landings at Ominato, Aomori, Hakodate, and Otaru in September and October.

==Post-war==
&quot;Chester&quot; embarked homeward bound troops at Iwo Jima, and sailed on 2 November for San Francisco, arriving on 18 November. She made another voyage to Guam to bring home servicemen (24 November – 17 December), then steamed on 14 January 1946 for Philadelphia, arriving on 30 January.

&quot;Chester&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve in Philadelphia on 10 June. She was sold for scrap on 11 August 1959.

<text>Kenneth Albert Arnold (March 29, 1915 – January 16, 1984) was an American aviator, businessman, and politician.

Arnold is known best for reporting what is generally considered the first widely publicized modern sighting of an unidentified flying object (UFO) in the United States, after claiming to have seen nine silver-colored discs flying in unison near Mount Rainier, Washington on June 24, 1947. After his alleged sighting, Arnold began investigating reports of UFOs, writing and speaking about the topic for several years afterward.

In 1962, Arnold won the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Idaho, losing the election of the same year.

==Biography==
Arnold was born on March 29, 1915, in Sebeka, Minnesota. He grew up in Scobey, Montana. He was an Eagle Scout and all-state football player in high school. He attended the University of Minnesota in 1934–35. His family was of Lutheran faith.

In 1938, he began work for Red Comet, manufacturer of automatic firefighting equipment. He was promoted to district manager the next year. In 1940, Arnold started his own company, the Great Western Fire Control Supply in Boise, Idaho, which sold and installed fire suppression systems, a job that took him around the Pacific Northwest.

In 1941, Arnold married Doris Lowe (1918–1990); they had four daughters.

==Role in UFO phenomenon==

===Arnold&#x27;s 1947 UFO sighting===

On June 24, 1947, Kenneth Arnold claimed that he saw a series of nine, shiny unidentified flying objects flying past Mount Rainier at speeds that Arnold estimated at a minimum of 1,200 miles an hour (1,932 km/h). This was the first post-World War II sighting in the United States that garnered nationwide news coverage and is credited with being the first of the modern era of UFO sightings, including numerous reported sightings during the next two to three weeks. Arnold&#x27;s description of the objects also resulted in the press soon inventing the terms &quot;flying saucer&quot; and &quot;flying disc&quot; as popular descriptive terms for UFOs.

===Investigation of Maury Island UFO &quot;hoax&quot;===

After the 1947 UFO sighting, Arnold became famous &quot;practically overnight&quot;. Arnold&#x27;s daughter would later recall the family receiving 10,000 letters and constant telephone calls.

Arnold was contacted by Raymond A. Palmer, editor of science fiction magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, who asked Arnold to investigate the story of two harbormen in Tacoma who reportedly possessed fragments of a &quot;flying saucer&quot;. Palmer sent $200 to fund the investigation.

On July 29, Arnold interviewed a harborman who claimed that one of the objects &quot;began spewing forth what seemed like thousands of newspapers from somewhere on the inside of its center. These newspapers, which turned out to be a white type of very light weight metal, fluttered to earth&quot;. The harborman claimed the craft emitted a substance resembling lava rocks that fell onto his boat, breaking a worker&#x27;s arm and killing a dog.

Arnold interviewed Fred Crisman, an associate of the harborman, who reported having recovered debris from Maury Island in 
Puget Sound and having witnessed an unusual craft. Crisman showed &quot;white metal&quot; debris to Arnold, who interpreted it as mundane and inconsistent with the harborman&#x27;s description.

Arnold contacted the Air Force, and two officers arrived to investigate. The officers performed interviews, collected the fragments, and took off in their airplane. While returning to their base in California, during the early hours of August 1, the two officers died when the B-25 Mitchell airplane they were piloting crashed outside of Kelso, Washington.

Writing in 1956, Air Force officer Edward J. Ruppelt would conclude &quot;The whole Maury Island Mystery was a hoax. The first, possibly the second-best, and the dirtiest hoax in the UFO history.&quot; Ruppelt observed:

The government had thought seriously of prosecuting the men. At the last minute it was decided, after talking to the two men, that the hoax was a harmless joke that had mushroomed, and that the loss of two lives and a B-25 could not be directly blamed on the two men.
===Aftermath===

Arnold was involved with interviewing other UFO witnesses or contactees (notably, he investigated the claims of Samuel Eaton Thompson, one of the first alleged contactees).

In spring 1948, Arnold and Science Fiction editor Raymond Palmer collaborated on an article titled &quot;I &quot;Did&quot; See The Flying Disks&quot;, based on Arnold&#x27;s sighting. In 1950, Arnold self-published a 16-page booklet titled &quot;The Flying Saucer As I Saw It&quot;. In 1948, he authored &quot;Are Space Visitors Here?&quot; and &quot;Phantom Lights in Nevada&quot;.

On April 7, 1950, broadcaster Edward R. Murrow interviewed Arnold, who stated that since June 1947 he had had three additional sightings of nine spacecraft.

In January 1951, Cosmopolitan magazine published an article titled &quot;The Disgraceful Flying Saucer Hoax&quot;, which accused Arnold of &quot;[igniting] a chain reaction of mass hypnotism and fraud that has taken on the guise of a prolonged &#x27;Martian Invasion&#x27; broadcast by that bizarre hambone Orson Welles&quot;.

In 1952, Arnold and Palmer authored &quot;The Coming of the Saucers&quot;.

Reportedly, Arnold came to believe he had experienced seven additional sightings, one of which involved a transparent saucer he likened to a jellyfish. By 1955, he began to promote space animal hypothesis when he suggested that the UFOs are &quot;sort of like sky jellyfish&quot;. Arnold added: &quot;My theory might sound funny, but just remember that there are a lot of things in nature that we don&#x27;t know yet&quot;. In 1962, he argued &quot;the so-called unidentified flying objects that have been seen in our atmosphere are not spaceships from another planet at all, but are groups and masses of living organisms that are as much a part of our atmosphere and space as the life we find in the oceans&quot;.

==Political career and later life==
In 1962, Kenneth Arnold announced plans to campaign for Governor of Idaho, and won the Republican nomination for the 1962 Idaho lieutenant gubernatorial election; in the election, Arnold lost to incumbent Democrat W. E. Drevlow. In 1964, Arnold publicly campaigned for Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, flying an airplane painted with Goldwater &#x27;64 slogan &quot;Au-H2O-64&quot;. 


He appeared at a 1977 convention curated by the magazine &quot;Fate&quot; to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the beginning of the modern UFO age.

In 1984, Kenneth Arnold, aged 68, died from colon cancer at Overlake Hospital in Bellevue, Washington.

<text>Stanley Anthony Coveleski (born Stanislaus Kowalewski, July 13, 1889 – March 20, 1984) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for four American League (AL) teams between and , primarily the Cleveland Indians. The star of the Indians pitching staff, he won over 20 games each year from the war-shortened 1918 season through 1921, leading the AL in shutouts twice and in strikeouts and earned run average (ERA) once each during his nine years with the club. The star of the 1920 World Series, he led the Indians to their first title with three complete-game victories, including a 3–0 shutout in the Game 7 finale. Traded to the Washington Senators after the 1924 season, he helped that club to its second AL pennant in a row with 20 victories against only 5 losses, including a 13-game winning streak, while again leading the league in ERA.

Coveleski followed in the footsteps of his brother Harry as a major league pitcher. But after making his debut with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1912, he was sidetracked by three more seasons in the minor leagues before joining the Indians in 1916, and won only 13 major league games before turning 27. Coveleski specialized in throwing the spitball, where the pitcher alters the ball with a foreign substance such as chewing tobacco. It was legal when his career began but prohibited in 1920, with Coveleski being one of 17 pitchers permitted to continue throwing the pitch. In 450 career games, Coveleski pitched 3,082 innings and posted a record of 215–142, with 224 complete games, 38 shutouts, and a 2.89 ERA. He set Cleveland records of 172 wins, innings and 305 starts, which were later broken by Mel Harder and Willis Hudlin. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969.

==Early years==
Stanislaus Anthony Kowalewski was born on July 13, 1889, in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, one of eight children of Anthony and Ann (Racicz) Kowalewski, who had immigrated from Russian Poland in the early 1870s. They settled in Shamokin, where Anthony worked as a coal miner, in Northumberland County, east of the Susquehanna River and northeast of the state capital of Harrisburg. Stanley was the youngest of five baseball-playing brothers; his oldest brother Jacob died serving in the Spanish–American War (1898). In addition to his older brother Harry, who pitched in the major leagues between 1907 and 1918, their other brothers Frank and John also played professional baseball, but only in the minor leagues. Harry won 20 games in a season on three occasions during his 14-year major league career.

Like many his age in the Shamokin area, Coveleski began work as a &quot;breaker boy&quot; at a local colliery at the age of 12. In return for 72 hours of labor per week, Coveleski received $3.75, or about five cents an hour. &quot;There was nothing strange in those days about a twelve-year-old Polish kid working in the mines for 72 hours a week at a nickel an hour&quot;, he later recalled. &quot;What was strange is that I ever got out of there&quot;. Coveleski was rarely able to play baseball as a child due to his work schedule.

Nevertheless, he worked on his pitching skills during the evenings, when he threw stones at a tin can placed 50 feet away. When he was 18 years old, Coveleski&#x27;s abilities caught the attention of the local semi-professional ball club, which invited him to pitch for them. &quot;When it came to throwing a baseball, why it was easy to pitch&quot;, Coveleski recalled. &quot;After all, the plate&#x27;s a lot bigger than a tin can to throw at&quot;. His baseball career in Shamokin was short-lived; after five games, Coveleski relocated to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

==Philadelphia Athletics and minor leagues==
Coveleski signed his first professional contract in 1909 with the minor league Lancaster Red Roses, a club affiliated with the Tri-State League. Originally reluctant to sign for the club, he only agreed to do so if his older brother John also joined; at that time he anglicized his name, changing it to Coveleskie, which it would remain throughout his professional career. During his first trip to Lancaster, he recalled that it was &quot;the first time I ever rode on a train&quot;, and he added that he &quot;was too shy to eat in the hotel with the rest of the team&quot;. In 272 innings of work his first season, Coveleski had a 23–11 win–loss record with an earned run average of 1.95. He pitched two more seasons for Lancaster, earning a record of 53–38 in 109 appearances through three seasons.
In 1912, he pitched for the relocated Lancaster team, the Atlantic City Lanks, where he had a 20–14 record with a 2.53 ERA in 40 appearances, 30 of them starts. In September 1912, manager Connie Mack signed him to a contract with the Philadelphia Athletics and brought him to the major leagues. By the time Coveleski made his debut for the Athletics on September 10, pitching one inning in relief in an 8–6 road loss to the Detroit Tigers, the two-time defending World Series champions were more than a dozen games out of first place – the only year between 1910 and 1914 they failed to win the pennant. Coveleski won his first game two days later in his first start, a 3–0 three-hit shutout of the Tigers, allowing only two singles and a double by Ty Cobb. He pitched in five games for the Athletics that season, starting two of them and finishing the season with a 2–1 record and a 3.43 ERA. After the season ended, Mack felt that Coveleski needed more seasoning, and sent him to the Spokane Indians of the Northwestern League. Coveleski finished the 1913 season with a 17–20 record and a 2.82 ERA. Around that time, he married Mary Stivetts, and the following season he went 20–15, pitched over 300 innings, and led the league in strikeouts.

At the time of his debut, the powerhouse Philadelphia club boasted a strong group of talented pitchers, including Eddie Plank, Chief Bender, and Jack Coombs. Coveleski admitted that he &quot;[didn&#x27;t] know if I could have beat them out for a spot in the rotation.&quot; After the 1914 season, the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League wanted Coveleski, and traded five players to Spokane to acquire him. While Mack had an agreement with Spokane that Coveleski would be promoted after playing there for a time, the Athletics fell under new ownership in 1913 and lost control of him due to the Athletics&#x27; rights expiring. Coveleski spent his time in Portland learning to throw the spitball; originally using chewing tobacco, he later used alum. In his lone season with Portland, he won and lost 17 games, and had a 2.67 ERA. After the season ended, the Cleveland Indians purchased Coveleski from Portland, and he joined the major league squad in 1916.

==Cleveland Indians==

When Coveleski was brought up to the majors, the original intention was to use him as a relief pitcher. Due to an injury to Ed Klepfer, the Indians used him as a starter early on in the 1916 season, and kept him in the role when he performed well. He was scheduled to pitch in the first week of the season against his brother Harry, but the matchup never took place at Harry&#x27;s behest. On May 30, Coveleski hit the only home run of his career in the first game of a road doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns; the three-run shot in the tenth inning gave Cleveland a 4–1 lead, but the Browns came back to win 5–4 in 15 innings. Coveleski fought health problems during the season, suffering from tonsillitis in the middle of the year and pitching one game with a fever of . He finished the season with a 15–13 record and a 3.41 ERA in 45 games, 27 of them starts. Coveleski had lost 10 pounds due to illness during 1916, but recovered during the offseason, gained 20 pounds, and appeared healthier by the time the season began.

Coveleski&#x27;s status as the ace of the staff was demonstrated when he was named the starter for Opening Day of the 1917 season; he beat the Detroit Tigers 6–4 on April 11. He improved statistically during the 1917 season, winning 19 games and losing 14 with an ERA of 1.81 and a career-high 133 strikeouts. On September 19, Coveleski pitched the only one-hitter of his career, a 2–0 road win over the New York Yankees; the only hit came from Fritz Maisel in the seventh inning. Coveleski continued to improve during the 1918 season, which was ended on September 2 due to a preseason agreement among owners to shortened season due to World War I. His outings that year included 2–1 13-inning road loss to Philadelphia on May 15, in which he had a career-high ten strikeouts, and a 19-inning complete game on May 24 in New York as the Indians won 3–2. He finished the season with a 22–13 record, a 1.82 ERA, and 311 innings pitched in 38 games, 33 of them starts; his wins and ERA were both second in the American League to Walter Johnson. In 1919, Coveleski pitched in 43 games, starting 34, and had a 24–12 record and an ERA of 2.61.

At the beginning of the 1920 season, the spitball was banned by Major League Baseball. As a current spitball pitcher, Coveleski was grandfathered in, and was allowed to continue using the pitch until his retirement. He won his first seven starting appearances of the season, but on May 28 his wife died suddenly, and he was given some time off to mourn, returning to pitching two weeks later. He picked up his 100th victory on August 2 with a 2–0 shutout win over the Senators. Covaleski was the starting pitcher against the Yankees on August 16, and hit a sacrifice fly to help the Indians win 4–3, but it is best remembered as the game in which a pitch by the Yankees&#x27; Carl Mays hit Indians shortstop Ray Chapman in the head, resulting in the only death in major league history. Covaleski finished the 1920 regular season with 24 wins, 14 losses, a 2.49 ERA, and 133 strikeouts; he led the AL in strikeouts and finished second in ERA to Bob Shawkey.

Coveleski helped the Indians to win the AL pennant and play in the 1920 World Series against the Brooklyn Robins. Coveleski was the star of the Series, in which he pitched three complete game victories. He pitched the first game against Rube Marquard, and allowed one run and five hits in a 3–1 Cleveland victory. Four days later, he pitched Game 4, again allowing one run and five hits in a 5–1 win. In Game 7, the final one of the best-of-nine series, Coveleski threw a complete-game shutout with five hits against fellow spitballer Burleigh Grimes; the 3–0 victory gave the Indians the first World Series championship in franchise history. Coveleski had an ERA of 0.67, which remains a World Series record.
After spending the offseason hunting with Smoky Joe Wood, Coveleski returned to the Indians in 1921, and throughout the season, the Indians battled the Yankees for first in the American League. On September 26, the two teams faced off, but Coveleski failed to make it past the third inning; the Yankees won 8–7 to ensure they won the pennant. Coveleski pitched 315 innings in 1921, matching his career high from the year before, and had a 23–13 record and a 3.37 ERA. The following season, Coveleski married Frances Stivetts, the sister of his late wife. While he did cause the Yankees to move out of first place after winning an August 23 game against them, 4–1, it was his last game of the season. He finished the year with a 17–14 record, the first time since 1917 he did not have 20 wins, and a 3.32 ERA.

Early on in the 1923 season, Coveleski pitched 27 straight scoreless innings between April 22 and 30, starting with a 10-inning 1–0 shutout of the Tigers and ending when he allowed two runs in the ninth inning of a 4–2 road win over the same club. However, he won less frequently as the season wore on, losing three straight games in mid-August. His last game came on August 15, with over a month left in the season. Coveleski finished the season with a 13–14 record, his first season with a losing record. Despite that, he had an ERA of 2.76 and five shutouts, both of which led the AL. In 1924, Coveleski struggled, and at the end of May, he had four losses and an ERA of 6.49. On June 16 he broke Addie Joss&#x27; club record of 160 wins with a 2–1 complete-game win over the Yankees, with the winning run scoring with two out in the bottom of the ninth on second baseman Ernie Johnson&#x27;s error, with Coveleski batting; he had tied Joss&#x27; record two days earlier with a relief win in an 11-inning victory over the Boston Red Sox. In his last appearance on September 22, he gave up a career-high ten runs in a 10–4 loss to the Yankees, ending the season with a 15–16 record and a 4.04 ERA. In December 1924, after nine years pitching for Cleveland, Coveleski was traded to the Washington Senators for pitcher By Speece and outfielder Carr Smith.

Despite Coveleski&#x27;s success in Cleveland, he was not a fan of playing there; he stated that he &quot;didn&#x27;t like the town. Now the people are all right, but I just didn&#x27;t like the town.&quot; He also stated that it began to affect his performance on the mound and that he began to get &quot;lazy&quot; from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: &quot;The best thing that happened to me there was pitching to Steve O&#x27;Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn&#x27;t even need to give me a sign&quot;.

==Washington Senators and New York Yankees==
Due to the acquisition of Coveleski, combined with winning the 1924 World Series, the Washington Senators were considered favorites to win the AL in 1925. During his first season in Washington, Coveleski bounced back from his 1924 season, and by mid-July, critics regarded his success as the biggest surprise in baseball; Cleveland had considered him to be past his best. From May 9 to July 26 he compiled thirteen consecutive victories, ten of them complete games. He won twenty games and lost five that year, and his ERA of 2.84 led the AL. Coveleski also finished 12th in MVP voting that year, with Senators shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh winning the award. The Senators won the AL and were to face the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1925 World Series, but Coveleski suffered from sore back muscles late in the season. Coveleski pitched two games in the World Series. In Game 2, he faced Vic Aldridge in a pitcher&#x27;s duel; the teams were tied at one apiece in the eighth inning, but a two-run home run by the Pirates&#x27; Kiki Cuyler led to a 3–2 loss. Aldridge and Coveleski faced off again in Game 5, but Coveleski allowed four runs before being pulled with one out in the seventh inning, leading to a 6–3 Pirates win. The Senators lost the series in seven games, and he finished with a 3.77 ERA, five walks, three strikeouts, and two of the Senators&#x27; four losses.

Coveleski continued to pitch for Washington during the 1926 season. His performances that season included his 200th win, a 5–3 win in Cleveland on June 10, and a 2–0 victory against the Boston Red Sox on August 31, a game which was finished in only 78 minutes. Coveleski finished the season with 14 wins, 11 losses, 3 shutouts, and a 3.12 ERA in 36 games. To start the 1927 season, due to an injury to Walter Johnson, Coveleski became the Senators&#x27; Opening Day starter against the Red Sox; he won the game 6–2. However, his performance declined due to &quot;a chronically sore arm&quot;, which limited his playing time that season. Due to his sore arm, the Senators released him unconditionally on June 17, 1927. He finished the season with a 2–1 record and a 3.14 ERA in five games.

On December 21, 1927, Coveleski signed with the New York Yankees in an attempt at a comeback. In his final season, he posted a 5–1 record with a 5.74 ERA in 12 appearances. Coveleski failed to regain his form, however, pitching his last game on August 3, and after the signing of Tom Zachary, manager Miller Huggins released Coveleski. He retired from the game later that year.

==Later life and legacy==
In 1929, after leaving major league baseball, Coveleski relocated to South Bend, Indiana. There, he ran Coveleski Service Station for a time but closed the business during the Great Depression. He became a popular member of the community in South Bend, providing free pitching lessons to local youths in a field behind his garage. After his playing career ended, he dropped the &quot;e&quot; at the end of his name, as he never corrected anyone if his last name was incorrectly spelled. In 1969, Coveleski was named to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans&#x27; Committee alongside 1920s pitcher Waite Hoyt. Of his introduction into the Hall, he said, &quot;I figured I&#x27;d make it sooner or later, and I just kept hoping each year would be the one.&quot; His health declined in later years, and he was eventually admitted to a local nursing home, where he died on March 20, 1984, at the age of 94.

In addition to Coveleski&#x27;s induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in 1976. In 1984, the minor league baseball stadium in South Bend, Indiana, was named in his honor. Coveleski was interviewed by Lawrence Ritter for his 1966 book &quot;The Glory of Their Times&quot;, a series of interviews with players of the early 20th century. To fellow ballplayers, Coveleski was considered &quot;taciturn and ornery&quot; on days when he was scheduled to pitch but was otherwise friendly with a lively sense of humor.

Coveleski had 215 wins and 142 losses with a 2.89 ERA in 450 games, 385 of them starts, in a 14-year career. He had 224 complete games, 38 shutouts, 981 strikeouts, and pitched 3,082 total innings. His control was highly regarded. He never considered himself a strikeout pitcher, and it was not unusual for him to pitch a complete game having thrown 95 pitches or fewer. He once pitched seven innings of a game where every pitch was either a hit or a strike. In 2001, baseball writer Bill James ranked Coveleski 58th among the all-time greatest major league pitchers.

<doc id="556400" wikidata="Q333291" url="?curid=556400" title="Abstract (summary)">
<text>An abstract is a brief summary of a research article, thesis, review, conference proceeding, or any in-depth analysis of a particular subject and is often used to help the reader quickly ascertain the paper&#x27;s purpose. When used, an abstract always appears at the beginning of a manuscript or typescript, acting as the point-of-entry for any given academic paper or patent application. Abstracting and indexing services for various academic disciplines are aimed at compiling a body of literature for that particular subject.

The terms précis or synopsis are used in some publications to refer to the same thing that other publications might call an &quot;abstract&quot;. In management reports, an &quot;executive summary&quot; usually contains more information (and often more sensitive information) than the abstract does.

==Purpose and limitations==
Academic literature uses the abstract to succinctly communicate complex research. An abstract may act as a stand-alone entity instead of a full paper. As such, an abstract is used by many organizations as the basis for selecting research that is proposed for presentation in the form of a poster, platform/oral presentation or workshop presentation at an academic conference. Most bibliographic databases only index abstracts rather than providing the entire text of the paper. Full texts of scientific papers must often be purchased because of copyright and/or publisher fees and therefore the abstract is a significant selling point for the reprint or electronic form of the full text.

The abstract can convey the main results and conclusions of a scientific article but the full text article must be consulted for details of the methodology, the full experimental results, and a critical discussion of the interpretations and conclusions. Abstracts are occasionally inconsistent with full reports. This has the potential to mislead clinicians who rely solely on the information present in the abstract without consulting the full report.

An abstract allows one to sift through copious numbers of papers for ones in which the researcher can have more confidence that they will be relevant to their research. Once papers are chosen based on the abstract, they must be read carefully to be evaluated for relevance.

It is generally agreed that one must not base reference citations on the abstract alone, but the content of an entire paper. This is because abstracts may not be fully representative of the full report or article. Therefore, basing reference citations solely on the information present in the abstract could be misleading.

According to the results of a study published in &quot;PLOS Medicine&quot;, the &quot;exaggerated and inappropriate coverage of research findings in the news media&quot; is ultimately related to inaccurately reporting or over-interpreting research results in many abstract conclusions. A study published in &quot;JAMA&quot; concluded that &quot;inconsistencies in data between abstract and body and reporting of data and other information solely in the abstract are relatively common and that a simple educational intervention directed to the author is ineffective in reducing that frequency.&quot; Other &quot;studies comparing the accuracy of information reported in a journal abstract with that reported in the text of the full publication have found claims that are inconsistent with, or missing from, the body of the full article.&quot;

According to the Modern Language Association, there are almost no circumstances in which it is acceptable to cite an abstract: &quot;It only makes sense to cite an abstract if you are writing about the abstract &quot;as&quot; an abstract and not about the work it summarizes: for instance, if you are writing about different styles of writing abstracts used in the sciences and humanities.&quot;

== History ==
The history of abstracting dates back to the point when it was felt necessary to summarise the content of documents in order to make the information contained in them more accessible. In Mesopotamia during the early second millennium BCE, clay envelopes designed to protect enclosed cuneiform documents from tampering were inscribed either with the full text of the document or a summary. In the Greco-Roman world, many texts were abstracted: summaries of non-fiction works were known as epitomes, and in many cases the only information about works which have not survived to modernity comes from their epitomes which have survived. Similarly, the text of many ancient Greek and Roman plays commenced with a hypothesis which summed up the play&#x27;s plot. Non-literary documents were also abstracted: the Tebtunis papyri found in the Ancient Egyptian town of Tebtunis contain abstracts of legal documents. During the Middle Ages, the pages of scholarly texts contained summaries of their contents as marginalia, as did some manuscripts of the Code of Justinian.

The use of abstracts to summarise science originates in the early 1800s, when the secretary of the Royal Society would record brief summaries of talks into the minutes of each meeting, which were referred to as &#x27;abstracts&#x27;. The Royal Society abstracts from 1800 – 1837 were later collated and published in the society&#x27;s journal &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, with the first group appearing in 1832. These abstracts were generally one or more pages long. Other learned societies adopted similar practices. The Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) may have been the first to publish its abstracts: the &quot;Monthly Notices of the RAS&quot; launched in 1827, containing (among other things) abstracts of talks given at their monthly meetings; the full papers were published months or years later in the &quot;Memoirs of the RAS&quot;. The RAS abstracts were between one and three paragraphs long. In both cases, these early abstracts were written by the learned society, not the author of the paper. Perhaps the earliest example of an abstract published alongside the paper it summarises was the 1919 paper &quot;On the Irregularities of Motion of the Foucault Pendulum&quot; published in the &quot;Physical Review&quot; of the American Physical Society, which often published abstracts thereafter.

== Copyright ==
Abstracts are protected under copyright law just as any other form of written speech is protected.

==Structure==
Abstract is often expected to tell a complete story of the paper, as for most readers, abstract is the only part of the paper that will be read. It should allow the reader to give an elevator pitch of the full paper.

An academic abstract typically outlines four elements relevant to the completed work:
* The research focus (statement of the problem(s)/specific gap in existing research/research issue(s) addressed);
* The research methods (experimental research, case studies, questionnaires, etc) used to solve the problem;
* The major results/findings of the research; and
* The main conclusions and recommendations (i.e., how the work answers the proposed research problem).
It may also contain brief references, although some publications&#x27; standard style omits references from the abstract, reserving them for the article body (which, by definition, treats the same topics but in more depth).

Abstract length varies by discipline and publisher requirements. Typical length ranges from 100 to 500 words, but very rarely more than a page and occasionally just a few words. An abstract may or may not have the section title of &quot;abstract&quot; explicitly listed as an antecedent to content.

Sometimes, abstracts are sectioned logically as an overview of what appears in the paper, with any of the following subheadings: Background, Introduction, Objectives, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusions. Abstracts in which these subheadings are explicitly given are often called structured abstracts. Abstracts that comprise one paragraph (no explicit subheadings) are often called unstructured abstracts. Abstracts are important enough that IMRAD is even sometimes recast as AIMRAD.

==Abstract types==

===Informative===
The informative abstract, also known as the complete abstract, is a compendious summary of a paper&#x27;s substance and its background, purpose, methodology, results, and conclusion. Usually between 100 and 200 words, the informative abstract summarizes the paper&#x27;s structure, its major topics and key points. A format for scientific short reports that is similar to an informative abstract has been proposed in recent years. Informative abstracts may be viewed as standalone documents.

===Descriptive===
The descriptive abstract, also known as the limited abstract or the indicative abstract, provides a description of what the paper covers without delving into its substance. A descriptive abstract is akin to a table of contents in paragraph form.

==Graphical abstracts==
During the late 2000s, due to the influence of computer storage and retrieval systems such as the Internet, some scientific publications, primarily those published by Elsevier, started including graphical abstracts alongside the text abstracts. The graphic is intended to summarize or be an exemplar for the main thrust of the article. It is not intended to be as exhaustive a summary as the text abstract, rather it is supposed to indicate the type, scope, and technical coverage of the article at a glance. The use of graphical abstracts has been generally well received by the scientific community. Moreover, some journals also include video abstracts and animated abstracts made by the authors to easily explain their papers. Many scientific publishers currently encourage authors to supplement their articles with graphical abstracts, in the hope that such a convenient visual summary will facilitate readers with a clearer outline of papers that are of interest and will result in improved overall visibility of the respective publication. However, the validity of this assumption has not been thoroughly studied, and a recent study statistically comparing publications with or without graphical abstracts with regard to several output parameters reflecting visibility failed to demonstrate an effectiveness of graphical abstracts for attracting attention to scientific publications.

== Abstract quality assessment ==
Various methods can be used to evaluate abstract quality, e.g. rating by readers, checklists), and readability measures (such as Flesch Reading Ease).

<text>Mary Lou Finlay (born 1947) is a Canadian radio and television journalist, best known for hosting various programs on CBC Radio and CBC Television. 

== Education ==
Finlay graduated from the University of Ottawa in 1967 with a BA in English and French literature. For three years she did writing and researching for the Canadian War Museum before her leap to journalism when she began hosting a CBC Ottawa television magazine. 

== Career in broadcasting ==
In 1975, Finlay moved to Toronto to co-host CBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Take 30&quot;. She hosted her own program, &quot;Finlay and Company&quot;, in 1976 and 1977 and developed a loyal following. In 1978 she moved to CTV to co-host and produce the award-winning &quot;Live It Up!&quot;.

In 1981 she became co-host with Barbara Frum of CBC Television&#x27;s nightly current affairs program, &quot;The Journal&quot;. After the program&#x27;s first year, Frum remained as sole host and Finlay became a documentary reporter, remaining with the program until 1988. In that year she became host of CBC Radio&#x27;s current affairs program &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, where she remained until the spring of 1994. From 1994 to 1997, she hosted &quot;Now The Details&quot;, CBC Radio&#x27;s weekly media watchdog program.

Finlay became co-host with Barbara Budd of &quot;As It Happens&quot; on September 1, 1997, having to cover the death of Diana, Princess of Wales on her first day. She retired following her last appearance on November 30, 2005, which was a tribute show for Finlay celebrating her years with the CBC.

In 2008, she released &quot;The As It Happens Files: Radio That May Contain Nuts&quot; (Knopf Canada), a book of reminiscences of her time on the show.

She was a pilot, and flew small planes, as she revealed in an on-air interview with test pilot Chuck Yeager on &quot;As It Happens&quot;.

Finlay is now a fellow with the Centre for the Study of Democracy at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario.

<text>USS &quot;Louisville&quot; (CL/CA-28), a , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for the city of Louisville, Kentucky. She was active throughout the Pacific War. USS &quot;Louisville&quot; was the first large warship to be built in a drydock.

&quot;Louisville&quot; was launched on 1 September 1930 at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, sponsored by Miss Jane Brown Kennedy, and commissioned on 15 January 1931, Captain Edward John Marquart in command. &quot;Louisville&quot; since commissioning day has carried, on the prominent bulkhead, a shoe of the great stallion, Man o&#x27; War, as a talisman against evil.

She was originally classified as a light cruiser, CL-28, because of her thin armor. Effective 1 July 1931, &quot;Louisville&quot; was redesignated a heavy cruiser, CA-28, because of her 8-inch guns in accordance with the provisions of the London Naval Treaty of 1930.

==Service history==
===Interwar period===

&quot;Louisville&quot;″s shakedown cruise, running through the summer, fall, and winter of 1931, took her from Bremerton to New York City via the Panama Canal. Returning from New York, she participated in the 1932 fleet problems before commencing gunnery exercises in the San Pedro-San Diego area. During the winter of 1933, she steamed for Hawaii, returning after exercises to San Pedro where she became a schoolship for anti-aircraft (AA) training. In April 1934, the cruiser steamed out of San Diego to begin a nine-month voyage &quot;showing the flag&quot; at various ports in Central America, the Caribbean Sea, and along the gulf and east coasts. Arriving back in California in late fall, &quot;Louisville&quot; participated in gunnery and tactical exercises until the spring of 1935, when she departed for Dutch Harbor, Alaska, and, thence, to Pearl Harbor to take part in fleet problems.

For the next two years, she operated off the West Coast, participating in the 1936 and 1937 fleet problems, making good will calls at Latin American ports and undergoing local training operations. On 16 July 1937 at about 1200 hours, she collided with the American halibut-fishing boat &quot;Alten&quot; in the harbor at Ketchikan, Territory of Alaska; she and a United States Coast Guard Cutter, , assisted &quot;Alten&quot;″s crew of 11 and there was no loss of life, although &quot;Alten&quot; was badly damaged.

In January 1938, &quot;Louisville&quot; began a long Pacific cruise which took her to Hawaii, Samoa, Australia, and Tahiti before returning to Pearl Harbor for fleet problems. While in Sydney, Australia, the crew of the &quot;Louisville&quot; rescued a number of passengers from a sightseeing ferryboat which had capsized and sank when most of the passengers crowded on the open top deck ran to the rail to wave the cruiser off. Nineteen of the ferry&#x27;s passengers died.

The winter of 1939 found &quot;Louisville&quot; participating in fleet exercises in the Caribbean. She operated in these waters until May, when she returned to the west coast. After fleet problems off Hawaii that autumn, &quot;Louisville&quot; departed Long Beach, California, for an extended cruise through the Panama Canal to eastern South America. At Bahia, Brazil, she received orders to proceed to Simonstown, South Africa.

As a neutral ship, &quot;Louisville&quot; traveled the U-boat-infested waters with her American flag spotlighted. At Simonstown, she received $148 million in British gold for deposit in the United States. She then sailed for New York City, delivered her precious cargo and returned to the Pacific.

===World War II===
On 7 December 1941, &quot;Louisville&quot;, escorting and , was &quot;en route&quot; from Tarakan, East Borneo, to Pearl Harbor. She continued on to Hawaii, stopped briefly to survey the damage and proceeded on to California. There she joined Task Force 17 (TF 17) and steamed from San Diego on 6 January 1942, for Samoa, landing troops there on 22 January. Her first offensive operation of the war came on her return trip when she took part in carrier plane raids on 1–2 February on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. During this action, one of her scout planes went missing and the pilot and aircrewman were lost.

After a short stay at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Louisville&quot; commenced patrolling the Ellice Islands area to help protect American bases in that vicinity. Early in March she joined TF 119, a carrier force, and began operations to stem the Japanese advance down the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons. This force steamed in the Salamaua-Lae-Rabaul sector for a number of days, making airstrikes on numerous objectives.

Following this operation, &quot;Louisville&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor, proceeding from there to Mare Island Navy Yard, San Francisco, where her anti-aircraft armament was increased with additional 1.1 in and 20 mm cannon fitted. On 31 May, she steamed for the Aleutians to join TF 8 to counter the enemy forces expected to be in the area. Fortunately for &quot;Louisville&quot;, the Japanese carrier force did not locate her and the other cruisers during the attacks on Dutch Harbor, which coincided with the Battle of Midway. Her duties, during this period of Japan&#x27;s strongest efforts to establish the northern end of her &quot;ribbon defense&quot; in the western Aleutians, were primarily those of convoy escort, but included shore bombardment of Kiska Island.

On 11 November, the cruiser departed San Francisco for Pearl Harbor, continuing, after a few days on to the South Pacific, escorting several troop transports as far as New Caledonia. She then proceeded north to Espiritu Santo to Join TF 67, which was then battling Japanese forces in the Solomons. On 29 January 1943, &quot;Louisville&quot; participated In the Battle off Rennell Island, the last of the seven naval battles for Guadalcanal, after which she operated east of the island until it was entirely secured.
In April, &quot;Louisville&quot; steamed, via Pearl Harbor, to the Aleutians. There, as a unit of TF 16, the cruiser covered the assault and occupation of Attu (11–30 May) and participated In the pre-invasion bombardment of Kiska in July.

After the latter was evacuated by the Japanese, she conducted escort of convoy operations in the northern Pacific. In August 1943 she proceeded to the Mare Island Navy Yard for an overhaul to her machinery and alterations. Louisville was in overhaul at Mare Island from 8 October until 24 December 1943. Like her sister ships her forward mast was cut down and her aft mainmast was removed to be replaced with a lighter tripod just aft of the second funnel. &quot;Louisville&quot; had the camouflage measure 32-6D paint scheme added and two new mark 34 main battery directors installed. The 1.1 in AA cannon mounts were removed and replaced with several quad 40 mm Bofors mounts along with numerous 20 mm cannon. Improved radars and flagship spaces were also added. Following this work in January 1944, &quot;Louisville&quot; returned to the southern Pacific as the flagship of Rear Admiral J. B. Oldendorf, who was to command the naval gunfire support groups through the amphibious operations ahead. In the Marshalls at the end of the month, she bombarded Wotje Atoll, west of Kwajalein, on 29 January. Then the cruiser turned her guns on the airfield and troop concentrations on Roi and Namur on the southern tip of the atoll, contributing to the conquest of those islands by 3 February. During this campaign, while waiting bombardment further targets an 8-inch 55 caliber shell fired from ricocheted off the island to explode a near miss alongside &quot;Louisville&quot; starboard side causing heavy pieces of shrapnel which damaged the chiefs quarters, pierced the bulkhead, and turret No. 3 – 8-inch gun had shrapnel damage on the tips of the barrels- no injuries. Two weeks later, &quot;Louisville&quot; led the gunfire support group into action at Eniwetok.

After Eniwetok, &quot;Louisville&quot; joined TF 58, and with the fast aircraft carriers struck Japanese installations in the Palaus, in March, and bombarded Truk and Sawatan in April. June brought preparations for the invasion of the greater Marianas, and again &quot;Louisville&quot; was the leading unit in shore bombardment operations; beginning with Saipan, where she fired continuously for the first 11 days of that engagement, through the shelling of Tinian, and ending with the assault on Guam.

&quot;Louisville&quot; became the first large US ship to enter Philippine waters since 12 December 1941. On 21 October 1944, while &quot;Louisville&quot; was bombarding Leyte she was hit by the &quot;kamikaze&quot; plane shrapnel killing one crewmember. On 25 October 1944, she was in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, participating in the last engagement of a battleline as the Japanese southern force attempted to force its way into Leyte Gulf through Surigao Strait. Admiral Oldendorf deployed the American battleline across the strait and PT boats and destroyers on either side of the narrow body of water, defeating the Japanese ships as they passed through the strait.

Following Leyte operations, &quot;Louisville&quot; rejoined the fast carriers now designated TF 38, and participated in pre-invasion strikes against the enemy on Luzon. By the new year, 1945, &quot;Louisville&quot; was headed towards Lingayen Gulf. While en route on 5–6 January, two &quot;kamikazes&quot; headed for and scored on her. The first &quot;kamikaze&quot; on 5 January 1945 hit the No. 2 main battery 8-inch 55 caliber gun knocking it completely out of commission killing one man with 17 injured/burned including Captain Rex LeGrande Hicks. The second &quot;kamikaze&quot; on 6 January 1945 hit the starboard side signal bridge. Rear Admiral Theodore E. Chandler, commander of Cruiser Division 4 (CruDiv 4) was fatally injured helping the sailors man handle the fire hoses to put out the massive flames during the latter attack, and died of his wounds the following day. Commander (later Rear Admiral) William P. McCarty took control of &quot;Louisville&quot; and managed recovery efforts in fighting fires and restoration of equipment, for which he was awarded the Silver Star. 42 crewmen were also killed and 125 or more men were wounded. Bridge knocked out of commission at the time forced switch of control to battery no. 2 by second smoke stack. Despite extensive damage, the cruiser shelled the beaches and shot down several enemy planes before withdrawing on 9 January 1945 and proceeding to Mare Island Navy Yard for repairs.

Her repairs completed on 10 April 1945, &quot;Louisville&quot; delivered Admiral Halsey&#x27;s 50 officers and 100 staff to the battleship at Guam and &quot;Louisville&quot; returned to the Pacific to join TF 54 in providing gunfire support for ground forces on Okinawa. On 5 June 1945, she was again hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; (initially identified as a friendly plane). Four twin 20 AA cannon opened up to set the &quot;kamikaze&quot; ablaze prior to hitting &quot;Louisville&quot; which killed eight sailors on a quad 40 mm AA gun mount, injured 45 sailors, bent the number 1 smoke stack and cut &quot;Louisville&quot;″s seaplane off and left only the pontoon on the catapult. &quot;Louisville&quot; was back on the gun line by 9 June, to remain on station until ordered back to Pearl Harbor for repairs on 15 June.

==Post-war==

With the end of the war on 14 August, &quot;Louisville&quot; was again seaworthy and hurriedly prepared for postwar duties. On 16 August, she sailed for Guam to Darien, Manchuria, with Rear Admiral T. G. W. Settle on board. From Darien, where the evacuation of Allied prisoners of war was supervised, she steamed to Qingdao, where Japanese vessels in that area were surrendered by Vice Admiral Kaneko. &quot;Louisville&quot; then escorted the surrendered vessels to Jinsen, Korea, after which she returned to China for further postwar duties at Yantai. In mid-October, she joined the Yellow Sea force for abbreviated service before proceeding, via San Pedro, to Philadelphia, where she decommissioned on 17 June 1946 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Remaining with that fleet for the next 13 years, &quot;Louisville&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959, and sold on 14 September to the Marlene Blouse Corporation of New York.

&quot;Louisville&quot;″s ship&#x27;s bell is on display at the Navy Operational Support Center in Louisville, Kentucky. One of her main battery 8-inch 55 caliber gun turrets (Turret No. 2) damaged in a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack on 5 January 1945, was removed and replaced. The turret was repaired, but with the end of the war it was no longer needed. After sitting for over a decade, it was taken to the Nevada Test Site and converted into a rotating radiation detector, to collect data on nuclear tests. The turret is located 86 miles NNW of Las Vegas (Lat 37.139455, Long -116.109085).

<text>The Travis Walton incident was an alleged alien abduction of American forestry worker Travis Walton on November 5, 1975 in the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forests near Heber, Arizona. It is widely regarded as a hoax, even by believers of UFOs and alien abductions.

Walton was employed by future brother-in-law Mike Rogers on a federal contract. On October 20, Rogers acknowledged in writing that the job had fallen seriously behind schedule and might not be completed by the deadline. That night, Walton and Rogers watched &quot;The UFO Incident&quot;, a movie about the alleged abduction of Barney and Betty Hill. After the broadcast, Walton reportedly discussed the possibility of being taken aboard a flying saucer. 

On November 5, the crew reported Walton missing. They recalled driving back after sunset when Rogers stopped the truck and Walton walked into the forest towards an overhead light. Walton was illuminated by a beam of light, and Rogers drove away with the others. Police organized search parties that were called off at the insistence of Travis&#x27;s mother. After five days and six hours, Walton called his sister from a phone booth in Heber. Walton sold his story to tabloid &quot;The National Enquirer&quot;, which published the account and awarded the crew a $5,000 prize. In 1978, he wrote &quot;The Walton Experience&quot;, which was adapted into the 1993 film &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;.

Science writers Philip J. Klass and Michael Shermer highlight a potential motive for the hoax was to provide an &quot;Act of God&quot; that would allow the crew to avoid a steep financial penalty from the Forestry Service for failing to complete their contract by the deadline. In 2021, Mike Rogers made a social media post renouncing his status as a witness to Walton&#x27;s &quot;supposed abduction&quot;. After 2021 interviews with Rogers, researchers proposed that a nearby fire lookout tower and its spotlight were used to create the illusion of a flying saucer shining a beam of light on Walton.

==Background==
In the Spring of 1972, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; tabloid began advertising a $50,000 prize for proof of extraterrestrial visitors. By 1975, the prize had been raised to $100,000.

===Travis Walton and the Turkey Springs forestry job===
Travis Walton was born around 1953 to Mary Walton (later Mary Walton Kellott). On May 5, 1971, Travis Walton and associate Carl Rogers pleaded guilty to breaking into the offices of the Western Molding Company, stealing company checks, forging and then cashing them. The pair were placed on probation for two years, after which they were allowed to plead not guilty and &quot;cleanse their records&quot;.

In 1975, Travis, age 22, was a member of a seven-person forestry crew led by Carl&#x27;s older brother Michael H. Rogers, age 28. The year prior, Rogers won a bid for a federal contract to thin out small trees from an area known as Turkey Springs in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest when he underbid two other contractors. The Turkey Springs job called for the thinning of 1,277 acres by August 1975. Rogers requested, and was granted, an extension until November 10. On October 16, a Forestry Service inspector visited the site and concluded the job could not possibly be completed by the deadline. Failure to complete the job could lead to a $2,500 penalty and a disqualification from bidding on future Forestry Service contracts.

On October 20, Rogers wrote to his Forestry Service contracting officer: &quot;I cannot honestly say whether or not we will finish on time. However, we are working every day with as much manpower as I can hire. I will not stop work until the job is finished or until I am asked to stop. I have had considerable trouble keeping a full crew on the job. The area is very thick and the guys have poor morale because of this... We will keep working and trying hard.&quot;

===Barney Hill and NBC&#x27;s &quot;The UFO Incident&quot;===

On October 20, 1975, the same night that Rogers wrote to the Forestry Service, the NBC network aired a prime-time special: &quot;The UFO Incident&quot;, a made-for-TV movie about an alleged alien abduction. The film starred James Earl Jones as Barney Hill, who had undergone a hypnosis session with a psychiatrist in 1964, after which he reported recollections of an alien abduction. Recovered-memory therapy is not based on scientific evidence, and recovered memories are indistinguishable from false memories.

The film aired two weeks before the Travis Walton UFO incident, prompting suggestions that the film inspired Rogers and Walton to concoct their own alleged abduction story. Psychologists and skeptics argued that &quot;after viewing this movie, any person with a little imagination could now become an instant celebrity&quot; by claiming an abduction, concluding that &quot;one of those instant celebrities was Travis Walton.&quot;

According to researcher Philip J. Klass, shortly before his disappearance, Travis told his mother not to worry if he were ever abducted by aliens because he would return safe and sound.

== Incident==
On November 5, 1975, crew chief Michael H. Rogers reported Travis Walton missing to the Navajo County Sheriff. Six members of the crew claimed they were driving down a forest road when they saw a lit object above the ground near the roadway. They reported that Walton got out of the truck and ran towards the object, which shone a light on him. They said they drove away in fear, only to return 15 minutes later to find both Walton and the light missing. At 7:45 PM, a member of the logging crew called officer L.C. Ellison. Ellison, Sheriff Marlin Gillespie, and Deputy Kenneth Coplan drove to Heber to meet with the loggers. Rogers and two crew members agreed to return to Turkey Springs with the three officers, while the three other crew members refused to return and instead drove home in Rogers&#x27;s vehicle. The five men searched Turkey Springs until shortly after midnight, when Sheriff Gillespie paused the search until the morning.

Around 1:30 AM, Navajo County Deputy Sheriff Kenneth Coplan and Rogers visited Walton&#x27;s mother. According to Coplan, when he informed her of the disappearance, she said, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s the way these things happen.&quot; Coplan said he was shocked by how calmly she took the news and her general lack of surprise. Walton, his older brother Duane, and his mother were described by the sheriff as &quot;longtime students of UFOs&quot;. Because Travis Walton&#x27;s mother lived in a ranch house without telephone service, Rogers drove her into town so she could call Travis&#x27;s brother Duane and their sister while Coplan followed. Around 3:00 AM, Walton&#x27;s mother called her daughter, waking her; Deputy Coplan was again shocked at how well Travis&#x27;s family took the news.

===Missing person investigation===

The following day, November 7, a search party of nearly 50 people scoured the Turkey Springs area, but failed to find Travis or any signs of an altercation. Law enforcement were surprised when, after a few hours, Travis&#x27;s mother told them &quot;I don&#x27;t think there is any use of looking any further. He&#x27;s not around here. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s on this earth.&quot; Sheriff Gillespie then dismissed the volunteers. However the following morning, November 8, Rogers and Duane Walton complained in person about the discontinued search. As a result, Sheriff Gillespie assembled another search party which included a helicopter.

Regional papers covered the story on November 8, and that day, a member of a Phoenix-based UFO interest group recorded a 65-minute interview with crew chief Mike Rogers and Travis&#x27;s older brother Duane Walton. At no point during the interview did either express any fear or concern for Travis; rather, they expressed confidence that Travis would be returned. During the interview, Rogers discussed the Forestry contract, saying &quot;This contract we have is seriously behind schedule. In fact, Monday the time is up. We haven&#x27;t done any work on it since Wednesday because of this thing, and therefore it won&#x27;t be done. I hope they take that into account.&quot; Forestry contracts included an Act of God clause that excused contractors who were delinquent due to unforeseeable circumstances.

During the interview, Duane revealed that he, Travis, and their mother were UFO buffs who had previously discussed that if they ever saw a UFO, they would &quot;immediately get directly under the object&quot; because the &quot;opportunity&quot; to go aboard a UFO would be &quot;too great to pass up&quot;. Duane repeatedly insisted that Travis was &quot;not even missing. He knows where he&#x27;s at and I know where he&#x27;s at&quot;.

On November 9, law enforcement continued the search for Travis, until late afternoon when Walton&#x27;s mother again requested the search be halted.
By November 10, stories of Walton&#x27;s disappearance were being published throughout the US, UK, and Canada. On November 11, the press reported that Travis&#x27;s mother felt any further searching for Travis would be useless. Also on November 11, Rogers and the five other members of the forestry crew were interrogated by Arizona Dept. of Public Safety polygraph examiner C.E. Gilson to determine if the men had murdered Travis Walton. All denied having harmed Travis—Gilson opined that five out of the six men were being truthful and described results for the sixth man, Allen Dalis, as &quot;inconclusive&quot;.

===Walton returns===
On November 12, shortly after midnight, Walton placed a collect call to his sister&#x27;s home from a payphone in Heber, Arizona. He reached her husband, Grant Neff, who then drove to pick up Duane and proceeded to Heber to pick up Travis; Neff later reported he initially thought the caller was intoxicated. As part of the collect call procedure, Travis told the operator his name; she recognized his name as that of the missing man and alerted Sheriff Gillespie, who dispatched a Deputy to the family ranch house.

Deputy Glen Flake arrived at 2:00 AM, where he witnessed Duane Walton transferring fuel from one car to another after having forgotten to purchase gas before local stations closed. Flake did not reveal that they knew Travis had returned home, and Duane did not tell the deputy that Travis had been found.

Seeking medical attention for Travis, Duane reached out to a UFO researcher he&#x27;d met days prior; the researcher referred them to &quot;Dr.&quot; Lester Steward, a hypnotherapist. Duane took Travis to meet with Steward, but his first words were that Travis needed a medical examination with lab tests and was not ready for hypnotic regression. Steward noted that Travis seemed &quot;very confused&quot; and reminiscent of drug addicts he&#x27;d treated. Steward also noted that Travis had a small lesion on the inside crease of his right elbow, consistent with intravenous drug use. After meeting with Steward, the Waltons returned to Duane&#x27;s home where UFO researchers arranged a house call by two medical doctors who were also amateur UFO investigators. When they arrived at 3:00 PM, Duane forbade them to use their camera or tape recorder, nor would he allow them to ask Travis questions about his experience. The doctors noted the presence of the apparent puncture mark and estimated it to be 24 to 48 hours old.

That day, stories of Travis&#x27;s return had begun to spread, and press began calling Duane&#x27;s home in an attempt to reach Travis. Duane finally informed law enforcement of Travis&#x27;s return, calling Sheriff Gillespie who insisted on seeing Travis immediately. The sheriff drove the four hours into Glendale and arrived at 11:00 PM. Duane and Travis demanded that Sheriff Gillespie not record the interview.

After a local UFO group facilitated the connection, Duane and Travis moved into a suite at the Sheraton Inn in Scottsdale; Costs were covered by &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; in exchange for exclusive access to Walton and his story. On November 14, Travis skipped a polygraph interview with police, but that night, in the presence of &quot;Enquirer&quot; reporters, a doctor associated with a UFO group had a two-hour conversation with a hypnotized Travis about the incident. The following day, November 15, Travis was interviewed by Jack McCarthy a free-lance polygraph examiner arranged by a UFO group and the &quot;Enquirer&quot;. McCarthy concluded that Travis was engaged in a &quot;gross deception&quot; and had even been intentionally holding his breath in an attempt to &quot;beat the machine&quot;.

On November 22, Travis appeared on Phoenix television station KOOL where he was interviewed about the incident. Travis claimed that he lost consciousness when struck by a beam of light, and that he awoke in a hospital-like room, being observed by three short, bald creatures. He says that he fought with them until a human wearing a helmet led Walton to another room, where he blacked out as three other humans put a clear plastic mask over his face. Walton has said that he remembers nothing else until he found himself walking along a highway five days later, with the flying saucer departing above him.

== Publicity and popular culture==

In the days following Walton&#x27;s UFO claim, &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; awarded Walton and his co-workers a $5,000 prize for &quot;best UFO case of the year&quot; after they were said to have passed polygraph tests administered by the &quot;Enquirer&quot; and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO). Ufologist Jim Ledwith said, &quot;For five days, the authorities thought he&#x27;d been murdered by his co-workers, and then he was returned.&quot; According to Ledwith, &quot;all of the co-workers who were there, who saw the spacecraft, they all took polygraph tests, and they all passed, except for one, and that one was inconclusive.&quot;

Skeptics include the story as an example of a UFO hoax promoted by a credulous media circus with the resulting publicity exploited by Walton to make money. UFO researcher Philip J. Klass, who agreed that Walton&#x27;s story was a hoax perpetrated for financial gain, identified many discrepancies in the accounts of Walton and his co-workers. After investigating the case, Klass reported that the polygraph tests were &quot;poorly administered&quot;, that Walton used &quot;polygraph countermeasures,&quot; such as holding his breath, and that Klass uncovered an earlier failed test administered by an examiner who concluded the case involved &quot;gross deception&quot;.

In 1978, Walton wrote the book &quot;The Walton Experience&quot; detailing his claims. In 1993, the book served as the inspiration for the 1993 film &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;, starring Robert Patrick as Mike Rogers, D.B. Sweeney as Travis Walton, Craig Sheffer as Allan Dallis, Peter Berg as David Whitlock, and Georgia Emelin as Dana Rogers. Travis Walton made a cameo in the film. Paramount Pictures decided that Walton&#x27;s account was &quot;too fuzzy and too similar to other televised close encounters&quot;, so they ordered screenwriter Tracy Tormé to write a &quot;flashier, more provocative&quot; abduction story. On the opening day of &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; – March 12, 1993 – Walton and Mike Rogers appeared on the CNN program &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, which also featured Philip J. Klass.

Walton has occasionally appeared at UFO conventions or on television. He sponsors his own UFO conference in Arizona called the &quot;Skyfire Summit&quot;. In 2008, Walton appeared on the Fox game show &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot;. On January 19, 2021, Walton appeared on episode #1597 of the &quot;Joe Rogan Experience&quot; podcast. On August 25, 2023, he appeared in the fifth episode of the third season of &quot;How To with John Wilson&quot;, titled &quot;How to Watch Birds&quot;.

==Rogers-Walton dispute of 2021==
On March 19, 2021, Mike Rogers posted a statement to his Facebook page announcing &quot;I, Michael H. Rogers, being of sound and rational mind, do hereby give notice that I am no longer to be considered a witness to Travis C. Walton&#x27;s supposed abduction of November 5, 1975.&quot; He later clarified: &quot;Travis tried to keep a new remake of the movie a secret from me. He has always had his big secrets that he has kept from me. It angered me. I tried over the last two weeks to reason with [him], but of no avail. I don’t believe Travis is an honest person, and therefore I want nothing to do with him.&quot;

On April 30, Rogers placed a call to producer Ryan Gordon, who was working on a new film about the Walton incident. Gordon recorded the call without Rogers&#x27;s knowledge, as permitted by Arizona law. Two months later, on July 4, Gordon publicly posted audio from the call which featured Rogers explaining: &quot;We were talking in the woods one day... We were talking about creating a UFO hoax, okay? I don&#x27;t know how the UFO got there. But I remember... when I was driving the truck and he jumped out, it was all deliberate. It was all a staged thing, okay? He ran up there and there was something about the UFO not being real, although it looked real.&quot; Rogers and Walton later reconciled and Rogers issued a statement retracting his confession.

==Modern views==

===Waltons as UFO buffs and pranksters===
Mike Rogers and the Waltons were known for their interest in UFOs. One member of the crew recalled Mike Rogers and Travis Walton arguing about how UFOs can fly. Rogers later acknowledged he had watched &quot;the first part&quot; of the recent television special that dramatized the Barney Hill &quot;alien abduction&quot; case, while the Waltons acknowledged prior discussions of wanting to be taken aboard a UFO.
The Walton family long had a reputation for pranks and practical jokes. One neighboring family, the Gibsons, recalled being the target of multiple pranks.

Within four months of the incident, UFO author Raymond E. Fowler, himself a believer in UFOs and abductions, proposed that some members of the crew had been the victim of a hoax perpetrated by others in the crew. Authors including Klass and Pflock argue that Travis Walton and Mike Rogers planned the incident.

As early as 1978, crew member Steve Pierce expressed suspicion that the incident had been a hoax. Pierce noted that on the day of the incident, Rogers made the crew stay past dark whereas they usually ended work at 4:00 PM. Pierce recalled that Walton did not work at all during the day of the incident; instead, he slept in the truck while claiming to be ill &quot;from carousing too much&quot;. He also reported that Mike Rogers disappeared from the worksite for two hours that day.

===&quot;National Enquirer&quot; misrepresented polygraph results===
Authors including Michael Shermer and Philip Klass note that while the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; tabloid publicized the opinion of a private polygraph examiner who reported the witnesses as being truthful, it omitted all mention of Walton&#x27;s prior polygraph examiner who concluded Walton was being &quot;grossly deceptive&quot;. They further note that while law enforcement had conducted a polygraph examination of the crew during their missing persons investigation into Walton&#x27;s disappearance, the objective of that investigation was to determine whether the crew had killed Walton, not to investigate UFOs. Thus, they asked only four questions: three about violence against Walton and one asking if an unusual object was observed.

Science writer and skeptic, Michael Shermer opined: &quot;I think the polygraph is not a reliable determiner of truth. I think Travis Walton was not abducted by aliens. In both cases, the power of deception and self-deception is all we need to understand what really happened in 1975 and after.&quot;

===Contrast with alien abduction syndrome===
In the 1980s, reports of alien abductions became more widespread, promoted by authors Budd Hopkins, John E. Mack, and Whitley Strieber. Folklorist Thomas E. Bullard notes that stories of alien abductions exhibit a fairly consistent sequence and description of events. Scholars suggest that alien abduction syndrome is the result of sleep paralysis or false memory syndrome.

Walton didn&#x27;t report paralysis, recovered memories or other common elements of an &quot;alien abduction&quot; narrative, leading &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; screenwriter Tracy Tormé to opine &quot;I don&#x27;t think the Travis case is an abduction case... it doesn&#x27;t fit any of the other patterns as in the cases that were explored in [Budd Hopkin&#x27;s book] &quot;Intruders&quot;... So many witnesses, gone for five days... So I think all those things break the mold and make this case unique.&#x27; Philip J. Klass noted that &quot;a &#x27;UFO-Abduction Mold&#x27; did not yet exist in 1975&quot;.

===Possible role of fire lookout tower===
Robert Sheaffer, a long-time writer for &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; and a founding member of the UFO Subcommittee of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, has argued for decades that the Walton incident was a hoax. Starting in 2021, Sheaffer promoted the hypothesis that Rogers and the Waltons made use of a nearby fire lookout tower to achieve their hoax.

While the crew typically traveled back to Heber via Black Canyon Road, Sheaffer suggests they returned that night via Rim Road, which passes by Gentry Tower: a 70-foot-tall Forest Service fire lookout tower equipped with a generator, a 200 square-foot living space for the lookout, an outer metal catwalk, and a spotlight. Sheaffer suggests Travis walked towards the tower, which was brightly lit above the tree tops, until an accomplice in the tower illuminated him with the spotlight. Sheaffer proposes that when Rogers later drove the crew back to the supposed abduction site, they actually arrived at a different spot entirely—one closer to their Turkey Springs site.

<text>Carson Wayne Newton (born April 3, 1942), also known as Mr. Las Vegas, is an American singer and actor. One of the most popular singers in the United States from the mid-to-late 20th century, Newton remains one of the best-known entertainers in Las Vegas and has performed there since 1963. He is known by other nicknames such as &quot;The Midnight Idol&quot; and &quot;Mr. Entertainment&quot;.

As a teenager, Newton first performed in Las Vegas in the late 1950s and was mentored by some of the nation&#x27;s biggest artists including Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin and Elvis Presley. In 1963, he achieved headliner status at the Flamingo, a casino hotel in Las Vegas, and soon became one of the city&#x27;s most popular performers. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; describes Newton as &quot;America&#x27;s number one night club act&quot; and at his peak being more prominent in Las Vegas than both Sinatra and Presley. Newton is the highest-grossing entertainer in Las Vegas history. Throughout his career, Newton has appeared in a number of movies and television shows.

His well known songs include &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; (1963), &quot;Summer Wind&quot; (1965), &quot;Red Roses for a Blue Lady&quot; (1965), &quot;Daddy, Don&#x27;t You Walk So Fast&quot; (1972) and &quot;Years&quot; (1980). &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; is Newton&#x27;s signature song and was notably used in the 1986 movie &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.

==Early years==
Newton was born Carson Wayne Newton in Norfolk, Virginia to Patrick Newton (1915–1990), an auto mechanic, and his wife, Evelyn Marie Smith (1921–1985). He is of mostly English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh and German ancestry. His father served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Newton spent his early years in Fredericksburg, Virginia, learning the piano, guitar, and steel guitar at age six. He has perfect pitch. He performed in a local music radio show, playing steel guitar and singing country music, before school. On the weekends, he performed in a traveling road show of the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot;.

While he was a child, his family moved near Newark, Ohio. He began singing in local clubs, theaters, and fairs with his older brother, Jerry. Due to Newton&#x27;s severe asthma, his family moved to Phoenix in 1952, at his doctor&#x27;s suggestion. Soon after arriving in Phoenix, the brothers performed in a local television talent show &quot;Lew King Rangers&quot; and won. As a result, the owner of KOOL-TV, Tom Chauncey, who also televised the talent show, gave the brothers their own television show, &quot;Rascals in Rhythm&quot; and served as a mentor to them. The brothers, as the Rascals in Rhythm, appeared with the Grand Ole Opry roadshows and on ABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;; performed in front of then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower and auditioned unsuccessfully for Ted Mack&#x27;s &quot;Original Amateur Hour&quot;.

Newton attended North High School where he was the Sophomore Class President. He was also a member of the Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps. In the spring of 1958, near the end of his junior year of high school, a Las Vegas booking agent saw the two Newton brothers performing on their local TV show and took them back for an audition. Impressed with their audition, the booking agent signed Newton, then age 15, and his brother, as part of a two-week contract to perform in Las Vegas at the Flamingo. On closing night, Newton and his brother were offered a one-year contract to continue performing in Las Vegas. To pursue his music career, Newton left North High School just before finishing his junior year.

At age 18, Newton intended to join the US military but because of his asthma he was given a 1-Y rejection meaning he was qualified to serve only in the event of a major emergency. Instead, Newton volunteered his time performing shows for troops overseas.

==Career as an entertainer==

===Early career===
Wayne Newton and his brother performed at The Flamingo for five years doing six shows for six days a week. Newton credits his ability to base his performances on what the crowd wanted to hear for his early success in Las Vegas. In 1962, Newton performed the Irish folk song &quot;Danny Boy&quot; for Jackie Gleason in Phoenix. Impressed by Newton&#x27;s performance, Gleason told Newton &quot;don&#x27;t go on any other television show before you go on mine.&quot; On September 29, 1962, the brothers first performed on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. Over the next two years, Newton would perform on Gleason&#x27;s show 12 times, which were his first appearances on national television. In the early to mid-1960s, Newton also acted and sang as &quot;Andy,&quot; the baby-faced Ponderosa ranchhand, on the classic western TV series &quot;Bonanza&quot;. During the filming of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, Newton first met Elvis Presley (who was filming another show on the same set) and they went on to become good friends.

In 1962, Jackie Gleason organized an engagement between Newton and the Copacabana. There Newton first met Bobby Darin. Darin, who was impressed by Newton, agreed to produce Newton&#x27;s records. By 1963 Newton had been signed to Capitol Records, and his first album was released on the label. Newton&#x27;s hit song &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; was originally written for Darin to sing, however Darin was intent on Newton having a hit song of his own and gave it to him. &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; went on to reach No. 13 on the Hot 100.

Many other prominent entertainment icons such as Lucille Ball, Danny Thomas, George Burns, and Jack Benny lent Newton their support. For example, after Benny saw Newton performing at a nightclub in Sydney, Australia, he hired him to perform an opening act for a booking he had at Harrah&#x27;s Reno. Benny then hired Newton as an opening act for his comedy show in Las Vegas and to perform on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, which Newton did for five years. After his job with Benny ended, Newton was offered a job to open for another comic at the Flamingo but Newton asked for, and was given, a headline act in 1963. In 1965, Newton performed on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; as a country boy singing to animals. Impressed with Newton&#x27;s performance, CBS offered Newton his own TV show around this character. However, Newton declined the offer, at the urging of Lucille Ball, who told Newton unless &quot;you want to be this country boy the rest of your life, turn this series down...&quot;

Newton was known for his distinctive high-pitched voice, which stayed with him for most of his career, although his voice did lower somewhat in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1970s, Newton began focusing on primarily performing in Las Vegas.

===Mr. Las Vegas===
Following the death of Elvis Presley and the aging of many members of the Rat Pack, Newton emerged as the biggest entertainer in Las Vegas. In the 1970s, Newton performed primarily at the Desert Inn, The Frontier and Sands Hotel and Casino. Newton holds the record for total crowd counts during his peak.

&quot;Esquire&quot; described Newton as &quot;the biggest moneymaker in the history of Vegas. Nobody has drawn like that week in, week out. Not Elvis, not Sinatra. There&#x27;s just no comparison.&quot; Newton&#x27;s shows were especially popular in Las Vegas because of their length - often lasting up to three hours - which stood out in comparison to the short length of many headliners&#x27; shows at the time in Las Vegas.

In 1972, his recording of &quot;Daddy, Don&#x27;t You Walk So Fast&quot; sold more than one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in July 1972. The song peaked at No. 4 in the United States and No. 1 in Australia and Canada, while the album of the same name peaked at No. 25 on the album charts.

In 1975, Newton was featured in &quot;Glen Campbell Live in London&quot;, a TV special for the BBC. Campbell and Newton sang three songs together.

From 1980 through 1982, The Beach Boys and The Grass Roots performed Independence Day concerts on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, James G. Watt, President Reagan&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that &quot;rock bands&quot; that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted &quot;the wrong element&quot; who would threaten individuals and families attending any similar events in the future. Watt then announced that Newton, a friend and supporter of President Reagan, would perform at the Mall&#x27;s 1983 Independence Day celebration. Newton entered the Independence Day stage on the Mall on July 4, 1983, to mostly cheering members of the audience, but some members booed.

On May 23, 1989, Newton&#x27;s live stage show was broadcast as a pay-per-view event called &quot;Wayne Newton Live in Concert&quot;. Newton did not perform his trademark songs &quot;Danke Schoen&quot; or &quot;Red Roses for a Blue Lady,&quot; however he closed the show with a special finale of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; which culminated with an onstage rainfall.

On December 12, 1992, Newton hit No. 1 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Pop and Country charts with an Elvis-inspired song &quot;The Letter.&quot; Controversy swirled around this chart feat as &quot;The Letter&quot; did not chart at all on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s authoritative Hot 100 chart, Adult Contemporary chart, or &quot;Bubbling Under&quot; chart. It did not make the &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; chart either. This marked the first and only time in history that a record hit #1 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100 chart yet failed to chart on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100.

During the 1990s, Newton began performing at other casinos as their headliner, including Bally&#x27;s, Caesars Palace, and MGM Grand Las Vegas. Newton performed his 25,000th solo show in Las Vegas in 1994. In 1999, Newton signed a 10-year-deal with the Stardust, calling for Newton to perform there 40 weeks out of the year for six shows a week in a showroom named after him. The &quot;headliner-in-residence&quot; deal was the first of its kind. In 2005, in preparation for the eventual demolition of the Stardust Casino, the deal was amicably terminated. His last show at the Stardust was on April 20, 2005. In his final performance at the Stardust, Newton sang nearly his entire repertoire and songs of other Vegas mainstays as well. During the summer of 2005, Newton began a 30-show stint that summer at the Las Vegas Hilton.

===Later and current career===
Going into the 2000s, Newton continued to perform shows in Las Vegas and took a larger role serving as the face of Las Vegas.

In January 2005 Newton started a reality television show on E! called &quot;The Entertainer&quot;. The winner got a spot in his act plus a headlining act of their own for a year. During player introductions at the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend in Las Vegas, Newton sang Presley&#x27;s &quot;Viva Las Vegas.&quot;

Newton was featured on the 2007 fall season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; partnered with two-time champion Cheryl Burke. He became the third contestant to be eliminated from the contest. During the taping (which takes place at CBS Television City), he also became the first guest on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, which tapes on the same lot, under host Drew Carey, who began adding guests to the show, especially to present prizes. Newton appeared after a trip to Las Vegas was shown.

Beginning October 14, 2009, Newton began performing his then newest show &quot;Once Before I Go&quot; at the Tropicana in Las Vegas. In 2010, Newton took a five-year hiatus to spend time with his family and prepare his voice for later shows in Las Vegas. In 2016, Newton returned to the stage at Bally&#x27;s Hotel in the form of a lounge show called &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal,&quot; a combination of live singing, playing some of the 13 self-taught instruments (having learned in the past to give his voice a rest when performing six shows a night at the Fremont Hotel), and showing movie and TV clips of himself on screen.

After performing more than 30,000 shows on the Las Vegas Strip, Newton celebrated his 60th year on stage with a show entitled &quot;Mr. Las Vegas&quot; at Caesars Palace that ran from January through May 2019. Referring to his 60th year on stage, Newton said &quot;It&#x27;s hard for me to articulate, much less think about it...I was here when Caesars (Palace) was built. This hotel for me has always represented the flagship of the Strip.&quot;

In June 2020, Newton was seen on television commercials in North America as a spokesperson for Caesars Entertainment to promote the reopening of Caesars Entertainment resorts during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the 2022 NFL draft, which was held in Las Vegas, Newton announced, alongside Hall of Fame running back Marcus Allen, the Las Vegas Raiders&#x27; third round pick selection of Dylan Parham from the University of Memphis.

==Personal life==

On June 1, 1968, Newton married Elaine Okamura; they divorced in 1985. They have one daughter named Erin, born in 1976. On April 9, 1994, Newton married Kathleen McCrone, a lawyer from North Olmsted, Ohio. The couple have one daughter, born in 2002.

Newton was floated as a potential candidate for United States Senate by Frank Fahrenkopf, the former Republican State Chairman of Nevada, but Newton declined to run.

A street near Harry Reid International Airport is named Wayne Newton Boulevard. Newton was elected to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 2000. In 2010, Newton testified in front of the Rules Committee of the Virginia House of Delegates where he appealed for the state to recognize the Patawomeck Indian Tribe of Virginia. Newton believes his father and grandfather have Patawomeck ancestry.

===Arabian horse breeding===
Newton has stated, &quot;My two loves in life, from the time I can remember, were music and horses, and I couldn&#x27;t decide which I loved more.&quot; His Arabian horse breeding program, located at his Casa de Shenandoah ranch, is called Aramus Arabians, and has produced six generations of horses, breeding over 700 foals, with 96 champions . Newton&#x27;s first experience with horses was at his uncle&#x27;s farm, where he visited frequently. He bought his first horse when he sold his bicycle and his parents&#x27; movie camera to buy a foal when he was a sixth-grader. Originally owning Thoroughbreds and American Quarter Horses, he &quot;fell in love&quot; with the Arabian breed via his ownership of the Champion stallion Aramus, after whom he named his horse ranch. He first came to the attention of Arabian breeders in 1969 when he partnered with Tom Chauncey, an Arabian breeder and television station owner, to purchase the stallion Naborr from the estate of Anne McCormick. They paid $150,000, which at the time was the highest price ever paid for an Arabian horse at auction. Shortly thereafter, Newton formed a partnership with other Arabian breeders to purchase Aramus, who was a son of Naborr. He became the sole owner of Aramus in 1972.

Newton was given the Arabian Horse Breeders&#x27; Alliance (AHBA) Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007 during the first Arabian Breeder&#x27;s World Cup in Las Vegas. He continues to be directly involved in management of his horses, planning the breeding program for his horses, determining which to keep and which to sell, and even assisting his ranch staff during foaling season. He was awarded the Arabian Professional and Amateur Horseman&#x27;s Association Breeder of the Year award in 1996.

===Charitable causes===
Newton was featured in the production of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Say Love Enough&quot; (1996), an all-star single, also featuring Dolly Parton, Heidi Newfield and several other artist-celebrities; this production served to raise funds for diabetes research. Concurrently, the Wayne Newton Research Grant awarded by the American Diabetes Association was created. It has been awarded to several researchers including Jose F. Caro and Peter J. Roach.

In 2001, Newton succeeded Bob Hope as chairman of the United Service Organizations Celebrity Circle, a nonprofit-charitable corporation that provides live entertainment to members of the United States Armed Forces and their families. Newton was the grand marshal of the 80th Annual Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival in Winchester, Virginia from May 1–7, 2007. He canceled a sold-out show to join the Festival. In 2008, Newton received a Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service. The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a national memorial to President Wilson, commemorates &quot;the ideals and concerns of Woodrow Wilson.&quot; The award honors leaders who have given back to their communities.

===Finances and legal problems===
From 1980 to 1982, Newton was part owner of the Aladdin Hotel, in a partnership that led to a number of lawsuits and a failed attempt by Newton to purchase the entire hotel in 1983.

In 1992, Newton filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize an estimated $20 million in debts, much of which was accumulated while suing NBC for libel; he claimed the network had reported that he partnered with the Mafia to buy the Aladdin. His bankruptcy declaration included a $341,000 Internal Revenue Service tax lien. By 1999, he was financially well off again.

In August 2005, the IRS filed a lawsuit against Newton alleging that he and his wife owed more than $1.8 million in taxes and penalties. One of Newton&#x27;s tax lawyers disputed that, saying, &quot;We believe the IRS owes him money.&quot;

In late 2009, officials at Oakland County International Airport in Waterford, Michigan, claimed Newton owed the airport more than $60,000 for unpaid parking fees, which they claimed he owed after having abandoned a $2 million Fokker F28 plane there more than three years before. The plane was originally flown in for renovations in 2005. After they were completed in 2007, the plane was moved to an outside parking area. The monthly parking fees were $5,000. An aircraft of this type needs to have its engines run at least once a month to retain its airworthiness. The plane has since been disassembled, transported, and reassembled on his estate grounds.

In February 2010, Bruton Smith sued Newton, claiming he was delinquent on a loan he had personally guaranteed, then bought from Bank of America. Smith sought foreclosure of Newton&#x27;s Las Vegas ranch Casa de Shenandoah. That same month, Clark County sheriff&#x27;s deputies were refused entry to Newton&#x27;s ranch. The officers attempted to serve civil papers and seize property as part of a $501,388 judgment against Newton awarded to Monty Ward, his former personal pilot, but security personnel employed by Newton refused to accept the papers. Ward, who filed suit in 2006, won the judgment for past-due wages in January 2009.

Newton was enmeshed in another lawsuit over a stalled project to convert his 40-acre home into a museum. In this lawsuit, a developer claimed he purchased Newton&#x27;s home and paid the singer $19.5 million, with the understanding that Newton would move out and allow the property to be converted into a museum. The developer claimed that he had invested $50 million on the project, but that Newton had failed to move out and had deliberately thwarted construction efforts.

On December 17, 2012, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Bruce Markell approved the sale of Wayne Newton&#x27;s estate, Casa de Shenandoah, to be listed for sale by Nathan and Associates, a Las Vegas brokerage firm. Bankruptcy papers placed the value of the property at $50.8 million. The property remained on the market, until 2015, when Newton reached an accord with Lacy Harber, the businessman who owned 70% of the corporation that had purchased Casa de Shenandoah to turn it into a museum. Newton and his family moved back into the property, and in September 2015, after construction of a museum to house memorabilia, it was opened for public tours. On April 26, 2018, the property hosted its last public event before closing indefinitely for renovations.

<doc id="556411" wikidata="Q2979574" url="?curid=556411" title="Clone High">
<text>Clone High is an adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and Bill Lawrence for MTV. It premiered on November 2, 2002 in Canada, and January 20, 2003 in the United States. Set at a high school populated by the clones of well-known historical figures, the series follows its central cast which includes adolescent depictions of Abe Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Gandhi, Cleopatra and JFK. The series also serves as a parody of teen dramas such as &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Degrassi&quot;, and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;; every episode is humorously introduced as a &quot;very special episode&quot; with narration provided by Will Forte.

Lord and Miller first developed the series&#x27; concept, originally titled &quot;Clone High School, USA!&quot;, while at Dartmouth College in the 1990s, later pitching it to executives of the Fox Broadcasting Company during their tenure at Disney, who ultimately decided to pass on the program. The rights were purchased by Viacom International to air on their cable channel MTV, producing the series between 2002 and 2003; Disney&#x27;s television arm Touchstone Television retains a production credit. The show&#x27;s design is heavily stylized and its animation style is limited, emphasizing humor and story over visuals. The &quot;Clone High&quot; theme song, &quot;Master (Clone High Theme)&quot;, was written by Tommy Walter and performed by his alternative rock band Abandoned Pools. The series was produced by Bill Lawrence, who also produced &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot; and &quot;Cougar Town&quot;. Many &quot;Scrubs&quot; alumni, such as Zach Braff, Donald Faison, Sarah Chalke, John C. McGinley, Neil Flynn, and Christa Miller, provided the voices of characters in &quot;Clone High&quot; for free, with Flynn also reprising his role from &quot;Scrubs&quot; as the Janitor (Glenn) in a recurring role. Writing and voice work were done at North Hollywood Medical Center, where &quot;Scrubs&quot; was filmed.

The first season premiered on Canadian cable channel Teletoon&#x27;s late-night programming block The Detour on Teletoon on November 2, 2002, and MTV in the United States on January 20, 2003. It became embroiled in controversy regarding its depiction of Gandhi soon afterward, which prompted over 100 people in India to mount a hunger strike in response. Shortly after, MTV canceled the series, which had been receiving low ratings; the last episodes of the first season were seen in 2016 on MTV Classic in the United States. &quot;Clone High&quot; received mixed reviews from television critics upon its premiere, but it has since received critical acclaim and a cult following.

On July 2, 2020, it was announced that a revival of the series was in development at MTV Entertainment Studios with the creators Lord, Miller, and Lawrence returning. On February 10, 2021, it was announced that HBO Max (later Max) had ordered two seasons of the revival, which premiered on May 23, 2023. The second season of the revival (third season overall) premiered with all ten episodes on February 1, 2024. On July 26, 2024, the revival of the series was canceled after two seasons, leaving the series on another cliffhanger.

==Premise==
&quot;Clone High&quot; is set in a high school in the fictional town of Exclamation, US, that is secretly being run as an elaborate military experiment orchestrated by a government office called the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures. The school is entirely populated by the clones of famous historical figures who were created in the 1980s and raised with the intent of having their various strengths and abilities harnessed by the United States military. The principal of the high school, Cinnamon J. Scudworth, who wants to use the clones to create a clone-themed amusement park, dubbed &quot;Cloney Island&quot;, has his plans for the clones and secretly tries to undermine the wishes of the Board. He is assisted by his robot butler/vice principal/dehumidifier, Mr. Butlertron, who is programmed to call everyone &quot;Wesley&quot; and speak in three distinct intonations.

The show centers on the clones of five famous figures: Abe Lincoln, Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, JFK, and Gandhi. The central plot of the show revolves the clones going through day-to-day struggles and boundaries. The show also involves Abe either realizing and reciprocate the feelings of Joan of Arc, who is attracted to him, or stay with the vain and promiscuous clone of Cleopatra. Meanwhile, JFK&#x27;s clone, a macho, narcissistic womanizer, is also attempting to win over Cleopatra and has a long-standing rivalry with Abe.

=== Characters ===
==== Season 1 ====
*Abe Lincoln (voiced by Will Forte) is a clone of Abraham Lincoln and the main protagonist. He admires his &quot;clonefather&quot; Abraham Lincoln and feels that he is struggling to live up to him. He is in love with Cleopatra, and has an awkward and honest personality. Abe does not notice that Joan has feelings for him and unintentionally mistreats her by reinterpreting it as a sign of friendship.
* Joan of Arc (voiced by Nicole Sullivan) is a clone of Joan of Arc and Abe&#x27;s closest friend and confidante. She is an intelligent, cynical, and angsty goth. She secretly has a crush on Abe and resents how he ignores her advances in favor of hooking up with Cleopatra. She holds progressive political views, and &quot;somewhat naively support[s] every special-interest cause&quot;.
* Cleopatra &quot;Cleo&quot; Smith (voiced by Christa Miller in season 1, Mitra Jouhari in seasons 2 &amp; 3) is a clone of Cleopatra VII and a self-absorbed, vain, and often mean-spirited popular cheerleader. Cleo exerts power over everyone for her appearance and intelligence. She has relationships with both JFK and Abe. She becomes Joan of Arc&#x27;s foster sister when Cleopatra&#x27;s foster mother begins dating Joan&#x27;s foster grandfather. Her animation and character design are inspired by the depiction of people in Ancient Egyptian wall painting, drawn in profile with eyes highlighted by eyeliner.
* JFK (voiced by Christopher Miller) is a clone of John F. Kennedy and a handsome, popular, arrogant, and horny jock as well as Abe&#x27;s on-and-off rival for Cleo&#x27;s affections. He speaks with a Boston accent and pursues women, who he calls them &quot;broads&quot;.
* Gandhi (season 1, voiced by Michael McDonald) is a clone of Mahatma Gandhi and Abe&#x27;s other best friend. He, like Abe, is struggling to live up to his &quot;clonefather&quot; Mahatma Gandhi. As a result, he rebelled against his &quot;clonefather&quot; and reinvents himself as a wild party animal and serves as the show&#x27;s comic relief. Gandhi sees himself as a music artist and calls himself the &quot;G-Man&quot;. He did not return in the revival series after members of India&#x27;s parliament protested &quot;Clone High&quot;&#x27;s depiction of Gandhi in 2003, shown to be still frozen in 2023 (with Abe not noticing his absence, and Joan not remembering him at all due to the memory wipe machine used on all clones).
* Principal Cinnamon J. Scudworth (voiced by Phil Lord) is a mad scientist and the principal of Clone High, who initially secretly plans to use the clones as attractions for his hypothetical amusement park, dubbed &quot;Cloney Island&quot;, and many of the series&#x27; subplots surround him trying to find ways to accelerate his plans. After these plans are thwarted, he freezes his original batch of clones for twenty years, immediately resuming Clone High in the adjoining years with new clones. Scudworth is usually centered on the subplots of the show.
* Mr. Besley Lynn Butlertron (voiced by Christopher Miller) is Principal Scudworth&#x27;s Mr. Belvedere-esque sane robotic butler and reluctant sidekick.

==== Seasons 2 &amp; 3 ====
* Candide Sampson (voiced by Christa Miller) is Principal Scudworth&#x27;s strict, cold-hearted superior in the second and third season, put in charge by the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures as running Operation Spread Eagle. Principal Scudworth is shown to have a romantic interest in her. She is revealed to be Joan&#x27;s new foster mother in &quot;Sleepover&quot;.
* Frida Kahlo (voiced by Vicci Martinez) is a clone of Frida Kahlo, who is the most popular of the second generation of clones. She is shown to be a fan of skateboarding. She is a separate clone from the Frida Kahlo clone in the first season who appeared as a background character.
* Harriet Tubman (voiced by Ayo Edebiri) is a clone of Harriet Tubman, who is very preppy and Frida&#x27;s best friend. She is a separate clone from the Harriet Tubman clone voiced by Debra Wilson in the first season.
* Confucius (voiced by Kelvin Yu) is a clone of Confucius, who is obsessed with the Internet and various social media trends.
* Topher Bus (voiced by Neil Casey) is a clone of Christopher Columbus, who tries to distance himself from his &quot;clone-father&quot; by shortening his name and appearing to be supportive of social movements and trends. This appears to be a façade, as he is shown to troll people online through anonymous, hurtful comments.

=== Development ===

Phil Lord and Christopher Miller first met together while they were attending Dartmouth College. The profiles of Lord and Miller on the college&#x27;s newspaper caught the attention to former Disney chairman Michael Eisner. Lord and Miller attended a two-minute interview with animation executives at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. The next day, they signed a development deal at Walt Disney Television Animation to create Saturday-morning cartoons. They spent a year trying to create a Saturday morning show but felt that they were not &quot;Disney brand&quot; enough to pitch it. They were later hired by Touchstone Television to create primetime programming,&quot;&quot; and they wrote a few episodes of &quot;Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane&quot; and &quot;Go Fish.&quot; The show was originally pitched to the Fox Broadcasting Company, who purchased the show but decided not to order it to series due to a &quot;regime change&quot;. Miller deemed it the &quot;easiest pitch ever,&quot; considering the show&#x27;s use of famous figures. Following Fox&#x27;s rejection, MTV purchased the program in May 2001. Lord and Miller met and pitched the idea to their godfather Bill Lawrence, who started working on the first season of &quot;Scrubs&quot; at the time. Having difficulty affording an office, Lawrence helped Lord and Miller to have their offices at an empty part of North Hollywood Medical Center, where &quot;Scrubs&quot; was filmed. The show was at a low, limited budget, costing approximately $750,000 per episode. According to Miller during an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2017, &quot;Clone High&quot; helped Lord and Miller learn about filmmaking, including editing and execution of timing.

The series started development after they graduated in college and landed a deal at Walt Disney Television Animation. While attempting to develop a Saturday-morning cartoon, Miller developed the show&#x27;s premise with the clones attending at a university on a notebook. Lord later changed the show&#x27;s setting to a high school, attempting to lean into the tropes of teen dramas, a popular genre at the time. While making lists of people &quot;everybody [had] heard of&quot;, they found themselves limited in the number of historical figures they could depict, in consideration with avoiding &quot;litigious estates&quot; (such as the families of Albert Einstein and Marilyn Monroe) and &quot;keeping in mind&quot; with the viewership of MTV. The show&#x27;s depiction of Gandhi was based on people in high school and college Lord and Miller knew, who were of Indian descent that had a lot of boundaries and expectations by their families.&quot;&quot; His &quot;party guy&quot; persona was borrowed from their research, through which Lord and Miller found out that he was a party guy when he was young and in law enforcement school.

=== Voice cast and recording ===
Lord and Miller cast actors that had backgrounds on improv and comedy. Will Forte was cast as Abe Lincoln during production of the first season. His first voice-acting role, Forte was asked by Lord and Miller, who were friends with him, to voice Abe for the show. Forte had a positive feeling about the show, but felt nervous. When Forte first voiced the character, he thought that his voice performance for the role was boring, though he admitted that the emotions, the screams, and the singing of the character were &quot;fun to do&quot;. In 2024, Forte recalled on &quot;Animation World Network&quot; that he was &quot;terrified and overthinking it&quot;, thinking he was not good as the other voice actors in the show.

Nicole Sullivan, who was a friend of Christa Miller in her mid-20s, was convinced to visit the booth by Christopher and Christa Miller during a phone call. Sullivan had mixed thoughts due to her level of success in &quot;Mad TV&quot;, &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;, and &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. When Sullivan read the lines for Joan of Arc, Sullivan did not understand the show, feeling that the show was for a young audience. She recalled on &quot;Animation World Network&quot; that for the first five episodes of the first season, she did not &quot;know what [she] was doing&quot; with the character. By production of the second season, Sullivan felt more comfortable with the character, commenting that she was &quot;just as easy to play&quot;. Phil Lord provided the voice of Cinnamon Scudworth. In &quot;The Gazette&quot; article from 2003, Lord described the experience of voicing the character as &quot;fun&quot;, stating &quot;It&#x27;s just me screaming and pouting and being especially whiny.&quot; Lord also felt emotional when voicing the character. Allowing the voice actors to improvise while recording the lines, they occasionally make little additions in the lines, such as in the middle of a monologue.

The series also featured guest stars. Several of them were well-known celebrities, including Marilyn Manson,&quot;&quot; Michael J. Fox,&quot;&quot; Mandy Moore,&quot;&quot; Tom Green,&quot;&quot; Luke Perry,&quot;&quot; and Jack Black.&quot;&quot; Prior to the show&#x27;s premiere, Marilyn Manson received the script to record his lines for the show.

=== Writing ===
The writing staff of the show were picked by the creators for their specific sense of humor. The team included Judah Miller, Tom Martin, Murray Miller, Eric Kentoff, and Erica Rivinoja. The writing staff of &quot;Scrubs&quot; were also involved in the writing process, giving them &quot;jokes and thoughts&quot;. Several plotlines were based on Lord and Miller&#x27;s experiences. During an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2017, Bill Lawrence stated that the writers would sometimes &quot;stay in the psych ward [in North Hollywood Medical Center]&quot; and make the creators laugh, which was cited as one of the reasons why many cast members of &quot;Scrubs&quot; appeared in the show.

=== Animation and design ===
The art design was characterized by a flat appearance with a limited animation technique known as &quot;pose-to-pose&quot; animation, which was used as an influence to &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;. According to Jack Coleman of &quot;Collider&quot;, the characters were bordered with thick outlines and usually made up of &quot;strange evocative shapes&quot; and &quot;hard angles&quot;, a style similar to old UPA animated shows and other animated series at the time. The characters have little movements when they speak, and several assets of the animation were reused. The animation generally had a quick pace for comic timing, but the scenes with more emotional content had slower and more fluid movements. According to Lord, they never wanted the viewers to pay attention to the animation, but it was there to serve the show&#x27;s sense of humor and its stories. Gandhi is the most animated character on the show; he requires twice as many storyboard poses as any other character. The characters and backgrounds were traditionally drawn, and frames and cels were frequently recycled. 

Lord and Miller drew several concept drawings of JFK and Joan of Arc during development. &quot;Total Drama&quot; character designer Todd Kauffman did designs for the show&#x27;s intro. Kauffman later used &quot;Clone High&quot; as an influence to design the &quot;Total Drama&quot; characters as requested by the producers. The first season was animated by Rough Draft Studios. The second and third seasons were animated by Jam Filled Entertainment.

=== Music ===
&quot;Clone High&quot; featured a wide variety of music, usually exclusive to alternative rock, indie rock, midwest emo, hardcore punk, pop rock, metalcore, from mostly unknown and underground bands and musicians. The soundtrack included songs by Alkaline Trio, American Football, Ritalin, Catch 22, Ilya, The Gentleman, Drex, Taking Back Sunday, The Gloria Record, The Stereo, Jo Davidson, Saves the Day, Hot Rod Circuit, Thursday, Helicopter Helicopter, Owen, Dashboard Confessional, Elf Power, Abandoned Pools, The Get Up Kids, Mink Lungs, Mates of State, Snapcase, The Mooney Suzuki, Jon DeRosa, Ephemera, Jinnrall, Avoid One Thing, DJ Cellulitis, DJ Piccolo, Whippersnapper, Matt Pond PA, Mad City and Bumblefoot. The series&#x27; other background music and original score was written and produced by Scott Nickoley and Jamie Dunlap of Mad City Productions.

== Humor ==
&quot;Clone High&quot; uses two main sources of comedy: teen drama parodies and historical references. &quot;Clone High&quot; experimented long storylines with romances and running gags, constructed with adult jokes, conspiracy theories, and melodrama.&quot;&quot; With each episode is introduced as a &quot;very special episode&quot;, the show uses satire to appeal to MTV&#x27;s male targeted demographic, aged 17 to 25. The show parodied dramas that appeared on American television in the 1990s that dealt with themes such as drug abuse, AIDS, alternative lifestyles, racism, ostracism, and consequences of prom. The show also parodied aspects of teenagers on television, centering on school narratives, including presidential elections, standardized testing, makeovers, school musicals, celebrities, the prom, school athletics, and fundraisers. A lot of the show&#x27;s humor were references cited from common knowledge of the historical figures, including JFK yelling &quot;Nothing bad ever happens to the Kennedys!&quot; before crashing his car in the fifth episode of the first season.

Several aspects of the show parodied teen dramas. Part of the humor for this trope was that it mocked the misery of high school, tackling the issues with wit and absurdity. Themes of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; were used to parody the themes of homosexuality, eating disorders, sex, diseases, and morality. Plots, themes, and scenes of teen series and films were referenced: The love triangle of Abe, Joan, and Cleo parodied &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, the &quot;parents-are-away&quot; parties paid homage to &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;, the makeover plotline was reminiscent of teen films at the time (including &quot;Clueless&quot;), and a teen-suicide hotline subplot referenced &quot;Heathers&quot;. The idea of the characters having to live up to their expectations, an aspect common in teen dramas, was also used to style the show&#x27;s humor. While &quot;Clone High&quot; includes a sexually and diverse society, other themes satirize American racial and gendered norms, including the transformation of Gandhi from a geek into &quot;a shorter, browner Kennedy&quot; in the twelfth episode of the first season. There is an image of a dolphin hidden in almost every episode.

==Release==
&quot;Clone High&quot; was originally slated to premiere at the same time in Canada and the United States. The first episode debuted on November 2, 2002, on the Canadian cable network Teletoon. Reruns of the series were formerly aired on Teletoon&#x27;s now-defunct &quot;Teletoon at Night&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Teletoon Detour&quot;) block. Also, it briefly aired on MTV Canada, Razer (now MTV2), and Much and currently airs on Adult Swim in Canada. In the United States, the series premiered on January 20, 2003, on MTV. &quot;Clone High&quot; was a commercial failure, and it suffered low ratings during the run. After MTV publicists finished an apology to India on the show&#x27;s depiction of Gandhi on its press, Lord and Miller were forced to cancel the show. The remaining episodes can be viewed on unauthorized websites in the United States. In 2016, the entire first season aired in the United States for the first time on MTV Classic.

===Initial reviews===
Upon the first season&#x27;s premiere, &quot;Clone High&quot; initially received mixed reviews from television critics. On Metacritic, the show has a score of 60 out of 100 based on seven reviews from critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Several critics likened the &quot;enjoyably nervy&quot; humor to that of C&quot;urb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. In a positive review, Dakota Loomis of &quot;Flak Magazine&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;Clone High&quot; is original, quirky and worthwhile television, head and shoulders above the endlessly replicating reality show rabble.&quot; David Bianculli of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the series three stars, praising the vocal talents as &quot;entertaining&quot; and listed the show&#x27;s depictions of Joan of Arc and Cleopatra as the show&#x27;s best central characters. He concluded, &quot;&quot;Clone High&quot; is the highest of high concepts, a weird idea even for a season that brings us &quot;Joe Millionaire&quot;.&quot; &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; Rob Owen complimented the show: &quot;Yes, &quot;Clone High&quot; has the MTV-requisite sexual innuendo, but it&#x27;s more clever than much of what passes for humor in prime time today. And like &quot;Scrubs&quot;, it has heart, particularly when it comes to Abe and Joan.&quot;

Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that &quot;the dialogue isn&#x27;t always exactly funny, but it&#x27;s smile worthy,&quot; observing, &quot;the characters are intriguing in a lightweight way but could lose their appeal fast.&quot; Scott Sandell of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; felt that the show&#x27;s debut episode &quot;doesn&#x27;t quite live up to the obvious comedic potential behind the killer premise.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; Michael Farkash felt similarly, writing, &quot;The premise sounds intriguing, but what hatches in the first episode is a disappointing, weak strain of comic material, lacking the cunning, subversive quality of, say, &quot;South Park&quot;.&quot;

===Home video and streaming===
On January 24, 2005, Nelvana announced on Corus Entertainment&#x27;s website that &quot;Clone High&quot;, along with several others, would be released on home video with the retail initiative &quot;Teletoon Presents&quot;. The series was released as &quot;The Complete First Season&quot; in Canada by Kaboom! Entertainment and Nelvana. The DVD contains every episode from the original first season, including the five episodes which did not originally air in the United States. As of 2023, the series is available to be streamed on Paramount+ in the United States. On April 14, 2023, the first season was added to Max, ahead of the revival&#x27;s premiere. The revival, alongside the first season of the original show, was added to Hulu in October 2024.
== Gandhi controversy ==

In early 2003, an article in &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine depicting Mahatma Gandhi being beaten up by a muscular man sparked outrage in India. &quot;Clone High&quot; was caught in a crossfire when citizens in the country conducted internet searches on the &quot;Maxim&quot; article but also found out about the show&#x27;s Gandhi character on MTV&#x27;s website. This sparked an outrage in India over the show&#x27;s depiction of Gandhi. On January 30, 2003, the 55th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s assassination, approximately 150 protesters (including members of parliament) gathered in New Delhi and vowed to fast in response to &quot;Clone High&quot;, including Gandhi&#x27;s great-grandson Tushar Gandhi. Tom Freston, the head of Viacom (owner of MTV), was visiting the network&#x27;s India branch and was &quot;trapped in the building&quot;. In 2014, he recalled that protestors &quot;basically threatened that they&#x27;d revoke MTV&#x27;s broadcasting license in India if they didn&#x27;t take the show off the air&quot;.

MTV offered a quick apology, stating that &quot;&quot;Clone High&quot; was created and intended for an American audience&quot;, and &quot;we recognize and respect that various cultures may view this programming differently, and we regret any offense taken by the content in the show&quot;. Miller would later recall that executives at MTV enjoyed the show, and asked for the duo to pitch a second season without Gandhi. Lord and Miller&#x27;s two potential versions of a second season included one that made no mention of Gandhi&#x27;s absence, and another that revealed that the character was a clone of actor Gary Coleman. &quot;We pitched that, and it went up to the top at Viacom again and it got a big no,&quot; he remembered. This idea has since been scrapped as Gandhi did not return in the revival.

== Cult following and legacy ==

=== Retrospective reviews ===
The first season of &quot;Clone High&quot; garnered wide reappraisal and praise from television critics. Heather Marulli of Television Without Pity called the series &quot;a mini-masterpiece of the animated genre; an opus to the primetime cartoon&quot;. David Broermann of the website Freakin&#x27; Awesome Network gave the series an &quot;A+&quot;, saying it has &quot;some really really good character development and depth&quot; and an &quot;amazing soundtrack&quot;. He notes the fantastic use of multiple running gags keeping viewers on their toes. In 2009, the show was listed as number five on IGN&#x27;s &quot;Reader Choice: Top Animated Series&quot;. In a 2014 retrospective piece on the series, Jesse David Fox of &quot;Vulture&quot; praised the premise, characters, and voice-acting, writing that &quot;&quot;Clone High&quot; still holds up more than a decade later as a brilliantly funny, completely nuts, surprisingly heartfelt, tonally inventive masterpiece.&quot;

=== Popularity ===
After its initial cancelation in 2003, &quot;Clone High&quot; fell into obscurity in the United States. However, it survived on the internet and gained a fanbase throughout the years. A clip of Gandhi and George Washington Carver going &quot;Say what?&quot; inspired parody and remix videos on YouTube. After the show was announced to have a revival in 2020, the first season of the show gained popularity, with several memes posted on Instagram. &quot;Clone High&quot; also gained popularity on TikTok, which drew new audiences to the show. In late August 2020, a tweet that included a clip of JFK went viral on Twitter, spreading memes of JFK by September. Several memes included audio clips of JFK and videos of fans cosplaying as JFK on TikTok. Several fans also cosplayed other characters, such as Joan of Arc, for TikTok.

== Revival ==
Lord and Miller have stated that they have &quot;considered&quot; a live-action film adaptation of the series. In 2014, they explained that as they at that time were under contract with Fox, Lawrence had a television deal at Warner Bros. Television and the rights to &quot;Clone High&quot; were owned by MTV/Viacom, it would be difficult to resurrect the show. References to &quot;Clone High&quot; are present in their later productions: the duo admitted many jokes in &quot;22 Jump Street&quot; were &quot;ripped off straight from &quot;Clone High&quot;&quot;, while Forte also voices a Lego version of Lincoln in &quot;The Lego Movie&quot; (2014), and the original version of Lincoln in &quot;&quot; (2021). In a Grantland article from 2014, the two joked that &quot;our entire career has just been about getting &quot;Clone High&quot; back on the air&quot;. In the 2018 film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,&quot; produced by Lord and Miller, a billboard, designed in parody to the original poster for 22 Jump Street, appears promoting a movie titled &quot;Clone College&quot;, starring Abe and JFK.

In March 2020, Lord and Miller brought the first pitch of the revival to HBO Max (currently Max) on Zoom, along with others. On July 2, 2020, it was announced that a revival of the series was in development at MTV Entertainment Studios, with creators Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and Bill Lawrence returning; it was also revealed that original series writer Erica Rivinoja would serve as showrunner of the series, while also co-writing the pilot with Lord and Miller. On February 10, 2021, the series was ordered for two seasons by HBO Max. On June 23, 2021, Christopher Miller revealed the title of the revival&#x27;s first episode as &quot;Let&#x27;s Try This Again&quot;. On September 16, 2021, Tara Billinger, who is known for Paul Rudish&#x27;s &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; universe and created &quot;Long Gone Gulch&quot;, announced that she would be serving as art director. On October 29, 2022, Miller announced via Twitter, that the revival would premiere in the first half of 2023. On November 2, 2022, Lord, Miller, and Billinger posted teasers of the show on their Twitter pages. On January 28, 2023, the unfinished first episode of the revival was leaked.

On March 24, 2023, it was announced that a majority of the original cast would be returning, but the role of Cleopatra, who was originally voiced by Christa Miller, will now be voiced by Mitra Jouhari, while Christa Miller will now be playing Candide Simpson. Lord and Miller revealed that the character of Gandhi will not be returning in the first two seasons of the revival due to the controversy the original series faced over his portrayal, with the former stating that he may return in a potential fourth season. Joining the cast were Ayo Edebiri as Harriet Tubman (replacing Debra Wilson), Vicci Martinez as Frida Kahlo, Kelvin Yu as Confucius, Neil Casey as Topher Bus, Jana Schmieding as Sacagawea, Sam Richardson as Wesley, Mo Gaffney as Ms. Grumbles, Al Madrigal as Frederico, Danny Pudi as Dr. Neelankavil, Emily Maya Mills as Ethel Merman, and Michael Bolton, Ian Ziering, Steve Kerr, and a returning Mandy Moore as fictionalized versions of themselves. On April 5, 2023, an official teaser trailer was uploaded on the official channel for HBO Max. The final trailer was later released on May 8, 2023. The revival premiered on May 23, 2023.

In January 2024, the second season of the revival (third season overall) announced several new cast members joining the series. Consisting of Jermaine Fowler as Toussaint Louverture, Paul F. Tompkins as Professor Hirsute, Stephen Root as Schneider Snorkelle, Jackée Harry as a fictionalized version of herself based on Jack the Ripper, Hannah Simone as Lady Godiva, D&#x27;Arcy Carden as Bloody Mary, Randall Park as Mr. Kim, Jameela Jamil as Mrs. C, Renee Elise Goldsberry as Sandra Sandria and Richard Kind as Nostradamus (replacing Andy Dick). The trailer was uploaded the following week, confirming the entirety of the season airing on February 1. On July 26, 2024, it was announced that the revival would not be returning for a third season (fourth season overall), once again ending the series on a cliffhanger.

<text>Hoppity Hooper is an American animated television series produced by Jay Ward, and sponsored by General Mills, originally broadcast on ABC from September 12, 1964, until 1967. It is one of the earliest Saturday morning cartoons and Jay Ward&#x27;s first original one for this schedule. The series was produced in Hollywood by Jay Ward and Bill Scott, with animation done in Mexico City by Gamma Productions.

==Premise==
The three main characters are Hoppity Hooper, a plucky frog, voiced by Chris Allen; Waldo P. Wigglesworth, a patent medicine-hawking fox, voiced by Hans Conried, who posed as Hoppity&#x27;s long-lost uncle in the pilot episode; and Fillmore, a bear wearing a Civil War hat and coat, (poorly) playing his bugle, voiced by Bill Scott (with Alan Reed portraying the character in the pilot). The stories revolved around the three main characters, who lived in Foggy Bog, Wisconsin, seeking their fortune together through different jobs or schemes, usually ending in misadventure.

Each story consisted of four short cartoons, one aired at the beginning and end of each episode, with the four-part story shown over two consecutive episodes. Much like Jay Ward&#x27;s previous series &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;, &quot;Hoppity Hooper&quot; used pun-based titles to identify each upcoming segment and a narrator (voiced by Paul Frees and later by William Conrad), who often interacted with the characters and broke the fourth wall. Interspersed were recycled second features from the earlier series &quot;Peabody&#x27;s Improbable History&quot;, &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales&quot;, &quot;Aesop and Son&quot; and &quot;The World of Commander McBragg&quot;. In later syndicated runs, each four-part story was assembled into a single half-hour episode.

==Background==
Early versions of Waldo and Fillmore, under the names &quot;Sylvester Fox&quot; and &quot;Oski Bear,&quot; were included in the proposed series &quot;The Frostbite Falls Revue&quot;, the unsold concept that would eventually form the basis of &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;. The two-part pilot was produced in 1960 and featured Alan Reed as Fillmore. Production did not begin on the series until September 1964, after &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; had ended its run; by 1964, Reed was committed to the role of Fred Flintstone on &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and was unavailable, and Bill Scott took over the role; the pilot aired as produced with Reed&#x27;s voice as the first two segments.

The series was broadcast first-run by ABC and NBC on their Saturday morning schedule. The series was later syndicated to local television stations under the title &quot;Uncle Waldo&#x27;s Cartoon Show&quot;, beginning in 1965.

As of 2024, Wildbrain owns syndication rights to the series.

==Episodes==
Over the course of three seasons, 52 episodes were broadcast with two segments of Hoppity Hooper each. With two exceptions (as noted), each story line consisted of four episodes (or four shorts – making 27 stories told over 104 segments).

<text>Sidney Joseph Perelman (February 1, 1904 – October 17, 1979) was an American humorist and screenwriter. He is best known for his humorous short pieces written over many years for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. He also wrote for several other magazines, including &quot;Judge&quot;, as well as books, scripts, and screenplays. Perelman received an Academy Award for screenwriting in 1956.

==Early life, family and education==
Perelman was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the only son of Joseph and Sophie Perelman, who moved from one failed business to another until they found themselves raising chickens on a farm and running a dry goods store in Providence, Rhode Island.

He attended the Candace Street Grammar School and Classical High School in Providence. He entered Brown University in 1921, where he became editor of the campus humor magazine &quot;The Brown Jug&quot; in 1924.

==Career==
Perelman dropped out of Brown and moved to Greenwich Village in Manhattan, New York City.

Perelman wrote many brief, humorous descriptions of his travels for various magazines, and of his travails on his Pennsylvania farm, all of which were collected into books. (A few were illustrated by caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, who accompanied Perelman on the round-the-world trip recounted in &quot;Westward Ha!&quot;.)

Perelman is highly regarded for his humorous short pieces that he published in magazines in the 1930s and 1940s, most often in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. For these, he is considered the first surrealist humor writer of the United States. In these numerous brief sketches he pioneered a new and unique style, using parody to &quot;wring every drop of false feeling or slovenly thinking.&quot;
They were infused with a sense of ridicule, irony, and wryness and frequently used his own misadventures as their theme. Perelman chose to describe these pieces as &quot;feuilletons&quot; — a French literary term meaning &quot;literary or scientific articles; serial stories&quot; (literally &quot;little leaves&quot;) — and he defined himself as a &quot;feuilletoniste&quot;. Perelman&#x27;s only attempt at a conventional novel (&quot;Parlor, Bedlam and Bath&quot;, written in collaboration with Q.J. Reynolds) was unsuccessful, and throughout his life he was resentful that authors who wrote in the full-length form of novels received more literary respect (and financial success) than short-form authors like himself even as he openly admired British humorist P.G. Wodehouse. While many believe &quot;Dawn Ginsbergh&#x27;s Revenge&quot; to be a novel, it is actually his first collection of humorous pieces, many written while he was a student at Brown. It is largely considered juvenilia , and its pieces were never included in future Perelman collections.

The tone of Perelman&#x27;s &quot;feuilletons&quot; was very different from those sketches of the inept &quot;little man&quot; struggling to cope with life that James Thurber and other &quot;New Yorker&quot; writers of the era frequently produced. Yet his references to himself were typically wittily self-deprecatory—as for example, &quot;before they made S.J. Perelman, they broke the mold.&quot;

Sometimes he gleaned an apparently off-hand phrase from a newspaper article or magazine advertisement and then write a brief, satiric play or sketch inspired by that phrase. A typical example is his 1950s work &quot;No Starch in the Dhoti, &quot;S&#x27;il Vous Plait&quot;.&quot; Beginning with an off-hand phrase in a &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article (&quot;...the late Pandit Motilal Nehru—who sent his laundry to Paris—the young Jawaharlal&#x27;s British nurse etc. etc. ...), Perelman composed a series of imaginary letters that might have been exchanged in 1903 between an angry Pandit Nehru in India and a sly Parisian laundryman about the condition of his laundered underwear.

In other sketches, Perelman satirized popular magazines or story genres of his day. In &quot;Somewhere a Roscoe,&quot; he pokes fun at the &quot;purple prose&quot; writing style of 1930s pulp magazines such as &quot;Spicy Detective&quot;. In &quot;Swing Out, Sweet Chariot,&quot; he examines the silliness of the &quot;jive language&quot; found in &quot;The Jitterbug&quot;, a teen magazine with stories inspired by the 1930s Swing dance craze. Perelman voraciously read magazines to find new material for his sketches. (He often referred to the magazines as &quot;Sauce for the gander.&quot;)

Perelman also occasionally used a form of word play that was, apparently, unique to him. He would take a common word or phrase and change its meaning completely within the context of what he was writing, generally in the direction of the ridiculous. In &quot;Westward Ha!&quot;, for instance, he writes: &quot;The homeward-bound Americans were as merry as grigs (the Southern Railway had considerately furnished a box of grigs for purposes of comparison)&quot;. Another classic Perelman pun is &quot;I&#x27;ve got Bright&#x27;s Disease and he&#x27;s got mine&quot;.

He also wrote a notable series of sketches called &quot;Cloudland Revisited&quot; in which he gives acid (and disillusioned) descriptions of recent viewings of movies (and recent re-readings of novels) that had enthralled him as a youth in Providence, Rhode Island, later as a student at Brown University, and then while a struggling comic artist in Greenwich Village.

A number of his works were set in Hollywood and in various places around the world. He stated that as a young man he was heavily influenced by James Joyce and Flann O&#x27;Brien, particularly his wordplay, obscure words and references, metaphors, irony, parody, paradox, symbols, free associations, clang associations, non-sequiturs, and sense of the ridiculous. All these elements infused Perelman&#x27;s writings but his style was precise, clear, and the very opposite of Joycean stream of consciousness. Perelman dryly admitted to having been such a Ring Lardner thief that he should have been arrested. Woody Allen has in turn admitted to being influenced by Perelman and recently has written tributes in very much the same style. The two once happened to have dinner at the same restaurant, and when the elder humorist sent his compliments, the younger comedian mistook it for a joke. Authors that admired Perelman&#x27;s ingenious style included T.S. Eliot and W. Somerset Maugham.

Frank Muir, a British expert on comic writing, lauded Perelman as the best American comic author of all time in his &quot;Oxford Book of Humorous Prose&quot;. Humorist Garrison Keillor has declared his admiration for Perelman&#x27;s writing. Keillor&#x27;s &quot;Jack Schmidt, Arts Administrator&quot; is a parody of Perelman&#x27;s classic &quot;Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer&quot;, itself a parody of the Raymond Chandler school of tough, amorous &#x27;private-eye&#x27; crime fiction. Irish comedian and actor Dylan Moran listed Perelman as a major influence in his December 13, 2012 interview on the &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot; podcast (episode 343).

==Broadway and film==
Perelman wrote at least five original plays produced on Broadway from 1932 to 1963, two as collaborators with his wife Laura. The first was the musical revue &quot;Walk a Little Faster&quot;, which opened in December 1932. With Ogden Nash, he wrote the book for the musical &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; (music by Kurt Weill, lyrics by Nash), which opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than 500 performances. His final play &quot;The Beauty Part&quot; (1962), which starred Bert Lahr in multiple roles, fared less well, its short run attributed in part to the 114-day 1962 New York City newspaper strike.

In cinema, Perelman is noted for co-writing scripts for the Marx Brothers films &quot;Monkey Business&quot; (1931) and &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; (1932), and for the Academy Award-winning screenplay &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956).

Along with his explicit credits, Perelman and Laura West Perelman worked as contract screenwriters for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and made uncredited contributions for films such as &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1938).

His official credits include:

* &quot;Monkey Business&quot; (1931)
* &quot;Horse Feathers&quot; (1932)
* &quot;Hold &#x27;Em Jail&quot; (1932)
* &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot; (1933)
* &quot;Paris Interlude&quot; (1934)
* &quot;Florida Special&quot; (1936)
* &quot;Early to Bed&quot; (1936)
* &quot;Ambush&quot; (1939)
* &quot;Boy Trouble&quot; (1939)
* &quot;The Golden Fleecing&quot; (1940)
* &quot;One Touch of Venus&quot; (1948)
* &quot;Larceny, Inc.&quot; (1942) based on the Perelmans&#x27; Broadway play &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;
* &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956)
* &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1958), produced for television and featuring the final score written by Cole Porter

==Personal life==
Perelman&#x27;s personal life was difficult. In 1929 at the age of 25 he married the 18-year-old sister of his school friend Nathanael West, Laura West (née Lorraine Weinstein). The two worked as writing collaborators on the 1935 play &quot;All Good Americans&quot;, produced on Broadway, and both were signed by Irving Thalberg as contract screenwriters for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer the same year. They remained married until Laura&#x27;s death in 1970. Perelman did not remarry.

The marriage was strained from the start because of his innumerable affairs (notably with Leila Hadley).

Perelman reportedly regarded children as a nuisance. His son Adam (born in 1936) committed several robberies in the mid-1950s, was accused of attempted rape, and ended up in a reformatory for wayward boys. The two things that brought Perelman happiness were his MG automobile and a mynah bird, both of which he pampered like babies. His Anglophilia turned rather sour when late in his life he (temporarily) relocated to England. He returned to New York in 1972, having concluded that &quot;English life, while very pleasant, is rather bland. I expected kindness and gentility and I found it, but there is such a thing as too much couth.&quot;

Perelman had a problematic relationship with Groucho Marx, who once said of the writer, &quot;I hated the son of a bitch, and he had a head as big as my desk.&quot; In the later years of Perelman&#x27;s career, he bristled at being identified as a writer of Marx Brothers comedy, insisting that his publishers omit any mention of it in publicity material.

==Cultural influence==
Perelman was indirectly responsible for the success of Joseph Heller&#x27;s novel &quot;Catch-22&quot;. When first published, this novel received lukewarm reviews and indifferent sales. A few months later, Perelman was interviewed for a national publication. The interviewer asked Perelman if he had read anything funny lately. Perelman—a man not noted for generosity with his praise—went to considerable lengths to commend &quot;Catch-22&quot;. After the interview was published, sales of Heller&#x27;s novel skyrocketed.

Perelman picked up plenty of pungent expressions from Yiddish and liberally sprinkled his prose with these phrases, thus paving the way for the likes of Philip Roth.

The phrase &quot;crazy like a fox&quot; gained popularity after Perelman used it as a book title in 1944.

<text>Lucius Bentinck Cary, 10th Viscount Falkland GCH, PC (5 November 1803 – 12 March 1884), styled Master of Falkland until 1809, was a British colonial administrator and Liberal politician.

==Background==
Falkland was the son of Charles John Cary, 9th Viscount Falkland, and his wife, Christiana. He succeeded as tenth Viscount Falkland in 1809 at the age of five after his father was killed in a duel.

He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and on 21 April 1821, purchased an ensigncy in the 22nd Regiment of Foot. He exchanged from the half-pay of that regiment to the 63rd Regiment of Foot on 13 December 1821, and then to the 71st Regiment of Foot on 20 December 1821. Falkland purchased a lieutenancy in the 7th Regiment of Foot on 6 January 1825, and a captaincy on 9 December 1826. He retired from the Army in November 1830.

==Political and administrative career==
A reformer, Lord Falkland was elected to the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer in 1831. However, already on 15 May 1832, he was created Baron Hunsdon, of Scutterskelfe in the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave him a seat in the House of Lords. Five years later he was admitted to the Privy Council.

Falkland became Governor of Nova Scotia in 1840 after the recall of Sir Colin Campbell. He opposed the movement led by Joseph Howe for responsible government leading to Howe threatening to horsewhip him. He restructured the colony&#x27;s Executive Council by including reformers in the body which had previously been a Tory domain but resisted the demand that the majority party in the legislature be permitted to form a government.

Falkland&#x27;s term ended in 1846. He then returned to England and held office in the Whig government of Lord John Russell as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1846 to 1848. The latter year he was appointed Governor of Bombay, in which post he remained until 1853. He returned to England the same year and later served as a magistrate in Yorkshire.

==Marriage and family==
Lord Falkland married Lady Amelia FitzClarence (21 March 1807 – 2 July 1858 London), the last unmarried illegitimate daughter of King William IV and his mistress, Dorothy Jordan, on 27 December 1830 at the Royal Pavilion. The King gave away the bride and the ceremony was performed by the Bishop of Winchester; they spent their honeymoon at Cumberland Lodge. The couple lived at Rudby Hall, North Yorkshire. They had one son, Lucius William Charles Frederick Cary, Master of Falkland (24 November 1831 – 6 August 1871), who married Sarah Christiana Keighly (d. 4 October 1902), but died childless. Lord Falkland died in Montpellier in March 1884, aged 80. As his only son had predeceased him, he was succeeded in his titles (except for the barony of Hunsdon) by his younger brother Admiral Plantagenet Pierrepont Cary.

<doc id="556430" wikidata="Q18340387" url="?curid=556430" title="Tailorbird">
<text>Tailorbirds are small birds, most belonging to the genus Orthotomus. While they were often placed in the Old World warbler family Sylviidae, recent research suggests they more likely belong in the Cisticolidae and they are treated as such in Del Hoyo et al. 
One former species, the mountain tailorbird (and therefore also its sister species rufous-headed tailorbird), is actually closer to an old world warbler genus &quot;Cettia&quot;.

They occur in the Old World tropics, principally in Asia.

These warblers are usually brightly colored, with green or grey upper parts and yellow white or grey under parts. They often have chestnut on the head.

Tailorbirds have short rounded wings, short tails, strong legs and long curved bills. The tail is typically held upright, like a wren. They are typically found in open woodland, scrub and gardens.

Tailorbirds get their name from the way their nest is constructed. The edges of a large leaf are pierced and sewn together with plant fibre or spider&#x27;s web to make a cradle in which the actual grass nest is built.

==Species==
The genus contains 13 species:
Two species moved to the Cettiidae:
* Mountain tailorbird, &quot;Phyllergates cucullatus&quot;
* Rufous-headed tailorbird, &quot;Phyllergates heterolaemus&quot;

<text>Albert Hoffman (1915–1993) was an American painter and wood carver. Never progressing beyond a sixth-grade education, Hoffman earned his living operating a junkyard in Galloway Township, New Jersey, near Atlantic City. A self-taught artist, he found inspiration in narratives from the Torah and Nevi&#x27;im; over his lifetime he produced over 250 carvings whose subjects were drawn from the Bible or from his Jewish background. His works are also a mirror of his personal interests: whaling, horse racing, and Native Americans all found places in his paintings.

He produced three different types of carvings, bas reliefs, columnar reliefs, and compositional groups. His art is considered outsider art.

Though he sold some of his works and also did some carving for local synagogues, he created most of his art for himself. Nonetheless, he exhibited his work locally, where it won top prizes. His work has been shown across the eastern United States and a number of American museums hold public collections, including the American Folk Art Museum, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, and the Noyes Museum of Art.

<text>In microbiology, McFarland standards are used as a reference to adjust the turbidity of bacterial suspensions so that the number of bacteria will be within a given range to standardize microbial testing. An example of such testing is antibiotic susceptibility testing by measurement of minimum inhibitory concentration which is routinely used in medical microbiology and research. If a suspension used is too heavy or too dilute, an erroneous result (either falsely resistant or falsely susceptible) for any given antimicrobial agent could occur.

Original McFarland standards were made by mixing specified amounts of barium chloride and sulfuric acid together. Mixing the two compounds forms a barium sulfate precipitate, which causes turbidity in the solution. A 0.5 McFarland standard is prepared by mixing 0.05 mL of 1.175% barium chloride dihydrate (BaCl2•2H2O), with 9.95 mL of 1% sulfuric acid (H2SO4). 

Now there are McFarland standards prepared from suspensions of latex particles, which lengthens the shelf life and stability of the suspensions.
The standard can be compared visually to a suspension of bacteria in sterile saline or nutrient broth. If the bacterial suspension is too turbid, it can be diluted with more diluent. If the suspension is not turbid enough, more bacteria can be added.

<doc id="556442" wikidata="Q3268688" url="?curid=556442" title="USS St. Louis (CL-49)">
<text>USS &quot;St. Louis&quot;, eighth of nine light cruisers, was the fifth ship of the United States Navy named after the city of St. Louis, Missouri. Commissioned in 1939, she was very active in the Pacific during World War II, earning eleven battle stars.

She was deactivated shortly after the war, but was recommissioned into the Brazilian Navy as Almirante Tamandaré in 1951. She served until 1976, and sank under tow to the scrappers in 1980.

==Design==

As the major naval powers negotiated the London Naval Treaty in 1930, which contained a provision limiting the construction of heavy cruisers armed with guns, United States naval designers came to the conclusion that with a displacement limited to , a better protected vessel could be built with an armament of guns. The designers also theorized that the much higher rate of fire of the smaller guns would allow a ship armed with twelve of the guns to overpower one armed with eight 8-inch guns. During the design process of the , which began immediately after the treaty was signed, the US Navy became aware that the next class of Japanese cruisers, the , would be armed with a main battery of fifteen 6-inch guns, prompting them to adopt the same number of guns for the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;s. After building seven ships to the original design, additional changes were incorporated, particularly to the propulsion machinery and the secondary battery, resulting in what is sometimes referred to the &quot;St. Louis&quot; sub-class, which also included .

&quot;St. Louis&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . Her standard displacement amounted to and increased to at full load. The ship was powered by four Parsons steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. Unlike the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;s, the two &quot;St. Louis&quot;-class cruisers arranged their machinery in the unit system, alternating boiler and engine rooms. Rated at , the turbines were intended to give a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . She carried four Curtiss SOC Seagull floatplanes for aerial reconnaissance, which were launched by a pair of aircraft catapults on her fantail. Her crew numbered 52 officers and 836 enlisted men.

The ship was armed with a main battery of fifteen 6 in /47 caliber Mark 16 guns in five 3-gun turrets on the centerline. Three were placed forward, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair facing forward, with the third being directly pointed aft; the other two turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in another superfiring pair. The secondary battery consisted of eight /38 caliber dual purpose guns mounted in twin turrets, with one turret on either side of the conning tower and the other pair on either side of the aft superstructure. As designed, the ship was equipped with an anti-aircraft (AA) battery of eight guns, but her anti-aircraft battery was revised during her career. The ship&#x27;s belt armor consisted of 5 inches on a layer of of special treatment steel and her deck armor was thick. The main battery turrets were protected with faces and they were supported by barbettes 6 inches thick. &quot;St. Louis&quot;″s conning tower had 5-inch sides.

==Service history==
The keel for &quot;St. Louis&quot; was laid down on 10 December 1936 at the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 15 April 1938, and after completing fitting out work, was commissioned into active service on 19 May 1939, with the hull number CL-49. The ship was initially based in Norfolk, Virginia, for sea trials; her shakedown cruise concluded on 6 October, by which time World War II had broken out in Europe. She thereafter joined the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s Neutrality Patrols. During this period, on 3 September 1940, she embarked a group of officers to survey a number of locations in North and South America that the United States might obtain through the &quot;destroyers for bases&quot; deal with the United Kingdom. This voyage went as far north as Newfoundland in Canada and as far south as British Guiana, and ended on 27 October with her return to Norfolk.

On 9 November, &quot;St. Louis&quot; departed to join the Pacific Fleet. After passing through the Panama Canal on 14 November, she arrived in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 12 December. She thereafter took part in the routine training exercises with the rest of the fleet through the winter of 1940–1941, followed by a trip to Mare Island Naval Shipyard in California for an overhaul. She arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 20 June and returned to operations with the fleet. In August, &quot;St. Louis&quot; and several other cruisers embarked on a voyage to the western Pacific; they conducted patrols between Wake Island, Midway Island, and Guam, before sailing for Manila in the Philippines. They arrived back in Pearl Harbor in late September. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was dry docked at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard on 28 September for routine maintenance. By 7 December, she had returned to her usual mooring in the Southeast Loch.

===World War II===
At 07:56 on 7 December, men aboard &quot;St. Louis&quot; reported seeing Japanese aircraft overhead, beginning their attack on Pearl Harbor. Shortly thereafter, the order to general quarters was given, and the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns began to engage the attacking aircraft. The engine room crew had begun preparations to get the ship underway by 08:06. Fourteen minutes later, the anti-aircraft gunners had shot down a Japanese aircraft, and by 09:00, had downed another pair. The ship slipped from her mooring at 09:31 and steamed toward the South Channel. Her 6-inch guns were quickly restored to operation as the crew prepared for the possibility of a surface action.

Naval historians have reported that a Japanese midget submarine that was in the channel entrance attempted to torpedo &quot;St. Louis&quot;, but in fact, the reported &quot;torpedo&quot; was a porpoising minesweeping float being towed by the USS Boggs (DD-136). Before being identified as such, however, the Boggs&#x27; skipper, Lt. Cmdr. David Roberts, unhesitatingly ordered his ship to turn into the path of the supposed torpedo. Destroyers arrived and dropped depth charges on the imagined submarine, allowing &quot;St. Louis&quot; to proceed to open waters without further interruption. The ship took part in the unsuccessful search for the Japanese carrier strike force, but by 10 December, she had returned to Pearl Harbor. &quot;St. Louis&quot; thereafter escorted transport ships that evacuated casualties to California and brought reinforcements to Hawaii.

====1942====
&quot;St. Louis&quot; thereafter joined Task Force 17 (TF 17), which was centered on the aircraft carrier . The unit left San Francisco on 6 January 1942 as an escort for troop ships carrying a Marine expeditionary force to American Samoa to strengthen the garrison there. The troops were disembarked at Pago Pago between 20 and 24 January, and TF 17 then moved to launch a series of air strikes in concert with Task Force 8 on the Japanese-held Marshall and Gilbert island groups. In response, the Japanese sent several submarines and elements of the 1st Air Fleet to launch a counter-attack, but they recalled both groups before making contact with either American task force. The ships thereafter returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 February.

&quot;St. Louis&quot; was then detached from TF 17 to resume escorting convoys between Hawaii and California, along with one to the New Hebrides. She next joined the escort for the ocean liner , which was carrying Manuel L. Quezon, the President of the Philippines, to the United States. The ships arrived in San Francisco on 8 May, and the next day, &quot;St. Louis&quot; got underway to return to Pearl Harbor. There, she joined a group of ships carrying reinforcements to Midway during the preparations for the Battle of Midway. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was used to carry two companies of the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion and a battery of guns. The ships offloaded aircraft and marines on 25 May, and &quot;St. Louis&quot; was then transferred to Task Force 8, which was sailing north to bring reinforcements to the Aleutian Islands. At that time, the unit also included her sister ships and , the heavy cruisers and , and fourteen destroyers, commanded by Rear Admiral (RADM) Robert Alfred Theobald.

TF 8 arrived in Kodiak Island on 31 May, where &quot;St. Louis&quot; refueled in preparation for patrol duty to the south of the Alaskan Peninsula. She conducted these operations through July, and on 3 August, she got underway to bombard Japanese positions on Kiska in the Aleutians. After shelling the island on 7 August, she returned to Kodiak four days later and then resumed patrols in the area. She took part in the occupation of Adak Island. &quot;St. Louis&quot; left the Aleutians on 25 October by way of Dutch Harbor for another overhaul at Mare Island, which was completed by early December.

====1943–1944: Solomons Islands campaign====
&quot;St. Louis&quot; left San Francisco on 4 December as part of the escort for a convoy of transport ships en route to New Caledonia. The ships arrived on 21 December, where &quot;St. Louis&quot; separated from the convoy to join Allied forces waging the Solomon Islands campaign. She moved first to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, and from there, embarked on her first offensive operations in January 1943, conducting bombardments of Japanese positions at Munda and Kolombangara, particularly targeting the airfields there. Over the next five months, she participated in numerous patrols in &quot;the Slot&quot; and raids against Japanese positions in the area. The former were intended to block Japanese reinforcement missions—the so-called &quot;Tokyo Express&quot;. During this period, the ship suffered a number of accidents, including jammed guns and the loss of one of her anchors, which tore a hole in the bow as it fell.

The first of these raids took place from 1 to 4 January, when &quot;St. Louis&quot; covered a group of seven transports carrying elements of the 25th Infantry Division to Guadalcanal. The unit at that time included six other cruisers and five destroyers, and was commanded by RADM Walden L. Ainsworth. Ainsworth left four cruisers and three destroyers to cover the convoy on the 4th, taking &quot;St. Louis&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot;, and &quot;Nashville&quot;, and two destroyers to bombard Munda in the early hours of 5 January. The ships fired a total of some 4,000 shells, but inflicted little significant damage to the Japanese airfield. The ships returned to Guadalcanal at 09:00 and began recovering their reconnaissance floatplanes when a Japanese airstrike arrived and damaged two of the other cruisers. &quot;St. Louis&quot; and the rest of the unit carried out a bombardment of Vila on the night of 23–24 January; &quot;St. Louis&quot; formed part of the covering force and did not take an active role in the attack. &quot;St. Louis&quot; and the rest of the unit were to conduct another attack on Munda on the night of 7–8 April, but a major Japanese air raid earlier on the 7th disrupted Allied plans and forced Ainsworth&#x27;s task force to flee south.

&quot;St. Louis&quot; and the rest of TF 68 conducted a sweep into Vella Gulf on the night of 6–7 May to distract Japanese attention from a group of fast minelayers that laid a minefield off New Georgia to block re-supply efforts. The ships encountered no Japanese opposition that night, but late on 7 May, four destroyers stumbled into the minefield. Three destroyers struck mines, one of which sank immediately, and the other two were sunk by American aircraft the following morning. On 12 May, TF 68 made another raid on Japanese positions in the area; &quot;St. Louis&quot; and the destroyers and were detached from the main force to bombard Munda while the rest of the ships attacked Vila.

=====Landing at Rice Anchorage=====
The invasion of New Georgia began on 30 June; &quot;St. Louis&quot; and the rest of TF 68 patrolled at the northern end of the Coral Sea; at that time, she cruised with &quot;Helena&quot;, &quot;Honolulu&quot;, and their escorting destroyer screen that consisted of , , , and . By 1 July, the ships were about south of New Georgia, and on 3 July they reached Tulagi, where a false report of a Japanese airstrike briefly sent the ships&#x27; crews to their battle stations. The Allied plan called for a second landing on New Georgia in the Kula Gulf on the northeastern side of the island. A landing here would block the resupply route for the Japanese forces fighting on the island and it would also deny their use of the gulf to escape once they were defeated, as they had done on Guadalcanal.

&quot;Nicholas&quot; and &quot;Strong&quot; reached Kula Gulf first, scanning it with their radar and sonar sets to determine if any Japanese warships were in the area. The cruisers and other two destroyers then entered the gulf to prepare to bombard Japanese positions at Vila. &quot;Honolulu&quot; opened fire first at 00:26 on 5 July, followed quickly by the other ships. Black Cats circling overhead coordinated the ships&#x27; fire. The bombardment lasted about fourteen minutes before the American column turned east to move to the Rice Anchorage to shell targets there. After another six minutes of shooting, the ships departed.Unbeknownst to the Americans, the three Japanese destroyers had arrived in the gulf while they were still shooting. Illuminated by the gun flashes, the American vessels were quickly identified by the Japanese over away.

The transport group then entered the gulf and steamed close to the shore to prevent intermingling with Ainsworth&#x27;s squadron, which had turned north at 12:39 to leave the gulf. Captain Kanaoka Kunizo, the senior destroyer commander in charge of the reinforcement operation, decided to withdraw as well to avoid engaging a superior force with his ships loaded with soldiers and supplies. &quot;Niizuki&quot;, the only radar-equipped destroyer, directed the aim of all three vessels, which launched a total of fourteen Long Lance torpedoes before withdrawing at high speed to escape back to Bougainville. One of these torpedoes struck &quot;Strong&quot;, which was still stationed at the entrance of the gulf on sentry duty. The destroyer was fatally damaged, but the attack alerted Ainsworth that there were Japanese warships in the area. &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; and &quot;Chevalier&quot; were detached to pick up survivors while Ainsworth prepared to search for the submarine he assumed to have been responsible, as none of his ships had detected the three Japanese destroyers on their radars. &quot;Strong&quot; sank at 01:22, with 239 of her crew taken off by the other destroyers, though some additional survivors were missed in the darkness and were later picked up by the transport group. Ainsworth&#x27;s ships then resumed their cruising formation at 02:15 for the voyage back to Tulagi.

At 07:00, &quot;Jenkins&quot; joined the squadron, which reached Tulagi in the early afternoon, where the ships immediately began refueling. Shortly thereafter, Ainsworth received orders from Halsey to return to Kula Gulf, as reconnaissance aircraft had spotted Japanese destroyers departing from Bougainville to attempt the planned reinforcement run that he had inadvertently disrupted the night before. Ainsworth was to intercept the destroyers and prevent the landing of more Japanese forces on the island. He ordered the ships to end refueling and prepare to get underway; &quot;Jenkins&quot; replaced &quot;Strong&quot; and the destroyer took the place of &quot;Chevalier&quot;, which had been damaged in an accidental collision with the sinking &quot;Strong&quot;.

=====Battle of Kula Gulf=====

Since the previous night&#x27;s reinforcement run had been aborted, the Japanese assembled a group of ten destroyers to make a larger effort the next night. &quot;Niizuki&quot;—now the flagship of Rear Admiral Teruo Akiyama—and the destroyers and were to escort the other seven destroyers—&quot;Nagatsuki&quot;, , , , , &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot;, and —carried 2,400 troops and supplies. Meanwhile, the American force intending to block their advance had formed up by 19:30 and began the voyage back up the Slot. As the Americans steamed toward Kula Gulf, the crews got their vessels ready for action, including closing all of the watertight doors to reduce the risk of flooding and turning off all lights to prevent detection by the Japanese.

The American squadron passed Visuvisu Point at the entrance to the gulf early on 6 July, at which point the vessels reduced speed to . Visibility was poor owing to heavy cloud cover. Ainsworth had no information as to the specific composition or location of the Japanese force, and patrolling Black Cats could not detect them in the conditions. The Japanese destroyers had already entered the gulf and begun unloading their cargoes; &quot;Niizuki&quot; detected the American ships on her radar at 01:06 at a range of about . Akiyama took his flagship, &quot;Suzukaze&quot;, and &quot;Tanikaze&quot; to observe the Americans at 01:43 while the other destroyers continued to disembark the soldiers and supplies; by that time, Ainsworth&#x27;s ships had already detected the three ships off Kolombangara at 01:36. As the two sides continued to close, Akiyama recalled the other destroyers to launch an attack. The American vessels transitioned into a line ahead formation, with &quot;Nicholas&quot; and &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; ahead of the cruisers; the line turned left to close the range to the Japanese vessels before turning right to move toward an advantageous firing position.

The American radars picked up Akiyama&#x27;s escort detachment along with another group of destroyers that was racing to join him; Ainsworth decided to attack the first group and then turn about to engage the second. At about 01:57, the American vessels opened up with radar-directed rapid fire. Between the three cruisers, they fired around close to 1,500 shells from their 6-inch batteries in the span of just five minutes. &quot;Niizuki&quot; received heavy fire from the other American ships and was quickly sunk, taking Akiyama down with her. But by that time, &quot;Suzukaze&quot; and &quot;Tanikaze&quot; had both launched eight torpedoes at the American line. They then fled to the northwest, using heavy smoke to conceal themselves while their crews reloaded their torpedo tubes. Both destroyers received minor hits during their temporary withdrawal but were not seriously damaged.

Ainsworth instructed his ships to turn to the right at 02:03 to begin engaging the second group of destroyers, but shortly thereafter three of &quot;Suzukaze&quot;″s or &quot;Tanikaze&quot;″s torpedoes struck &quot;Helena&quot; on the port side, inflicting serious, ultimately fatal damage. Ainsworth and the other vessels&#x27; captains were not immediately aware that &quot;Helena&quot; had been disabled owing to the course change, the general confusion that resulted from heavy smoke and gunfire during the battle, and the fact that most attention was directed at the oncoming second group of Japanese destroyers. In the ensuing action, several of the Japanese destroyers were hit and forced to disengage, after which Ainsworth attempted to reorganize his force at around 02:30. He quickly realized that &quot;Helena&quot; was not responding to radio messages and ordered his ships to begin searching for the missing cruiser. At 03:13, &quot;Radford&quot;″s radar picked up a contact and thereafter confirmed it was &quot;Helena&quot;″s sinking wreck.

=====Battle of Kolombangara=====
By 12 July, &quot;St. Louis&quot;″s unit had by then been re-designated to either Task Force 18 or 36.1 At that time, the unit consisted of &quot;St. Louis&quot;, &quot;Honolulu&quot;, and the light cruiser of the Royal New Zealand Navy, along with Destroyer Squadrons 21 and 12; it was still commanded by Ainsworth. The unit embarked on another patrol that evening, departing Tulagi at 17:00 on 12 July. Ainsworth sent his ships to general quarters at around 23:00. The Japanese supply convoy in the area that Ainsworth hoped to intercept was equipped with radar-detection equipment, and had already picked up Allied radar signals. Shortly after 01:00 on 13 July, the Allies encountered the Japanese force commanded by Rear Admiral Shunji Isaki, which was composed of the light cruiser and five destroyers, escorting a group of four destroyer-transports.

The Japanese spotted the Allied ships first, but the leading American destroyers launched their torpedoes first. In the ensuing Battle of Kolombangara, &quot;Jintsu&quot; and the destroyers launched a spread of torpedoes at the Allied squadron before the cruisers closed to within , where their gunnery control and search radars could effectively direct their shooting. All three cruisers concentrated their fire on &quot;Jintsu&quot;, she being the largest radar contact; after a few minutes of rapid fire, the ship exploded and, after being hit by a torpedo from one of the destroyers, quickly sank. The initial salvo of torpedoes missed, but the Japanese destroyers briefly retreated into a rain squall to reload their torpedo tubes before reemerging to launch another salvo. &quot;Leander&quot; was hit and fell out of the formation while &quot;St. Louis&quot; and &quot;Honolulu&quot; pursued the retreating Japanese destroyers. They opened fire, engaging the destroyer &quot;Mikazuki&quot; and what was probably the still-burning wreck of &quot;Jintsu&quot;. The Americans thereafter lost contact with the Japanese ships.

At around 01:56, &quot;Honolulu&quot; picked up a group of unidentified ships some away. Unsure of the identity of the vessels, which might have been his destroyers, Ainsworth held his cruisers&#x27; fire. At 02:03, he ordered star shells to illuminate the ships, which were immediately revealed to be the fleeing Japanese destroyers, which had just launched another salvo of torpedoes and turned away. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was hit by one of them in her bow at 02:08, before she could open fire, and shortly thereafter, &quot;Honolulu&quot; also received a minor torpedo hit. The destroyer was hit amidships and quickly sank. Casualties aboard &quot;St. Louis&quot; were light. Despite the fact that they had sunk &quot;Jintsu&quot; and drove off the destroyers, the Allied squadron had failed to prevent the destroyer-transports from reaching Kolombangara and landing 1,200 soldiers.

The Allied ships returned to Tulagi later on 13 July, and &quot;St. Louis&quot; was detached to return to the United States for repairs. She steamed first to Espiritu Santo for temporary work that would allow her to make the crossing to Mare Island Navy Yard, where permanent repairs were carried out. The work was completed by November, and included replacing her worn-out main battery guns, and swapping her poorly performing 1.1-inch anti-aircraft guns with Bofors guns.

=====Later operations=====
&quot;St. Louis&quot; arrived back in the Solomons in mid-November, and immediately resumed combat operations. From 20 to 25 November, she provided naval gunfire support to marines fighting on Bougainville. Further bombardment missions against Japanese forces on the island followed in December. In early January 1944, she moved south to the Shortland Islands to attack Japanese positions there. &quot;St. Louis&quot; then moved back north to Bougainville, where she joined the bombardment force that supported the landing at Cape Torokina. She returned to Tulagi on 10 January to begin preparations for the next major operation. This came in the form of the Battle of the Green Islands in February, an Allied amphibious assault on the Green Islands. The seizure of the islands, which were to the east of New Britain, was intended to isolate the Japanese base at Rabaul. &quot;St. Louis&quot; arrived off the island on 13 February to begin the bombardment for the assault, which was to come two days later. By that time, the ship had been assigned to Task Force 38, along with &quot;Honolulu&quot;.

Late in the day on 14 February, the Japanese launched an air attack consisting of six Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers against the American formation. At 18:55, lookouts spotted the aircraft; two of them targeted &quot;St. Louis&quot;. The first failed to score any hits with its three bombs, but the second aircraft struck &quot;St. Louis&quot; with one of its bombs. It passed through the shell handling room for the No. 6 Bofors gun mount, starting a fire as it did so, before exploding in the midship living compartment, where it killed twenty-three and wounded another twenty. Damage control efforts quickly suppressed the fire. The ship&#x27;s ventilation system was damaged, the communication line to the aft engine room was severed, and both of her aircraft were disabled, but &quot;St. Louis&quot; remained on station, albeit at the reduced speed of . The next day, another Japanese air strike failed to inflict any further damage to &quot;St. Louis&quot;, but she was nevertheless detached to return to Purvis Bay for repairs that lasted until the end of the month. In March, she returned to her unit and remained operating in the Solomons through May.

====Marianas campaign====
&quot;St. Louis&quot; left the Solomons on 4 June, bound for the Marshalls, where she joined Task Force 52, which had been formed for the invasion of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign in the central Pacific. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was assigned to one of the task force&#x27;s bombardment groups, Task Group 52.10, under the command of Ainsworth. The unit included the old dreadnought battleships , , and , five other cruisers, and nine destroyers, along with several support vessels. The invasion fleet departed on 10 June and arrived off Saipan on the 14th; the next day, &quot;St. Louis&quot; began bombarding the area around Chalan Kanoa at the start of the Battle of Saipan. The next day, the 2nd and 4th Marine Divisions landed on the island. As the American forces fought their way ashore, &quot;St. Louis&quot; remained close offshore to engage Japanese defensive positions. The following day, she sailed south to take part in the preparatory bombardment of Guam. On 17 June, she resumed operations off Saipan, where she remained through the Battle of the Philippine Sea. She was assigned to the anti-aircraft screen for the refueling group on 22 June, before being detached two days later to return to the Marshalls. By 9 July, the Japanese garrison on Saipan had been defeated.

The ship got underway again on 14 July to return to operations in the Marianas. By that time, Ainsworth&#x27;s command had been re-numbered TG 53.5 though its composition remained largely the same. While en route on the 15th, her No. 3 propeller was damaged and a section of that propeller shaft was destroyed. She reached Guam two days later and on the afternoon of 17 July, provided fire support as underwater demolition teams (UDT) dismantled fixed defenses at the planned landing sites. &quot;St. Louis&quot; thereafter took part in the pre-invasion bombardment, which lasted until 21 July, when American ground forces went ashore. The ship thereafter supported the soldiers and marines fighting on the island for more than a week, before departing on 29 July to return to port for repairs. She stopped in Pearl Harbor on the way to California, where her overhaul was performed. In mid-October, she returned to Hawaii for training operations that lasted through the rest of the month. She then crossed the Pacific to rejoin the main fleet, which had already begun the Philippines campaign. She arrived in Leyte Gulf on 16 November.

====Philippines campaign====
For the rest of November, &quot;St. Louis&quot; helped to defend the fleet from air attacks, patrolling in Leyte Gulf and the Surigao Strait. The ship was at that time part of Task Group 77.2, which included the old battleships , , and , three other cruisers, and sixteen destroyers. On 27 November, the Japanese launched a major counter-attack against Allied forces on and off Leyte, including heavy attacks on the Allied fleet. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was one of the vessels that was to come under sustained attack over the course of the action.

The first wave of twelve to fourteen aircraft appeared late in the morning, but &quot;St. Louis&quot; was not damaged. This attack prompted calls for support from the fleet&#x27;s combat air patrol (CAP). At around 11:30, a second wave of ten aircraft arrived, and at 11:38, a D3A dive bomber on a attack struck the ship, detonating its remaining fuel and the bomb it was carrying. The blast killed or wounded all of the 20 mm gun crews from mounts 7 through 10 and started a fire in the ship&#x27;s aircraft hangar. Immediately thereafter, at 11:39, a second burning aircraft nearly struck the ship, but &quot;St. Louis&quot; was able to evade the attempt, and the Japanese pilot flew over the No. 4 main battery turret and crashed into the sea about from the ship.

A third wave appeared shortly before noon, and CAP support had still not arrived to fend them off. A pair of Japanese aircraft dove on &quot;St. Louis&quot; at 11:51. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft gunners successfully shot down the first , but the second crashed into the ship&#x27;s port side, tearing a length of belt armor from the ship and punching numerous holes in the hull. &quot;St. Louis&quot; immediately began to take on a list to port as water entered the ship. Another attempted to attack at 12:10, but it was shot down about from the ship. At around 12:20, a group of torpedo bombers attacked &quot;St. Louis&quot;, but the cruiser had been warned of their approach by a PT boat and was able to evade the torpedoes.

Damage control teams made quick progress, and by 12:36, counter-flooding had restored the ship to an even keel. By around 13:00, the fires had been suppressed, and salvage work had begun on the damaged parts of the ship. The attacks had killed fifteen and wounded forty-three, of whom twenty-one were badly injured. Another man was missing. &quot;St. Louis&quot; transferred the seriously wounded men to a hospital ship on 28 November, and two days later, she anchored at San Pedro Bay for temporary repairs. She then sailed for California for permanent repairs in late December.

====Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign====
Work on &quot;St. Louis&quot; was completed by 1 March 1945, when the ship got underway to return to the fleet. She arrived at the fleet&#x27;s advance anchorage at Ulithi in mid-March and joined the anti-aircraft screen of the fast carrier task force. &quot;St. Louis&quot; was assigned to Task Group 58.4, escorting the aircraft carriers , , and in company with the fast battleships , , and , the large cruisers and , three other cruisers, and eighteen destroyers. In late March, the carriers launched a series of air strikes on the Japanese Home Islands. The Japanese responded with a counter-attack that primarily targeted TG 58.4. &quot;Intrepid&quot; and &quot;Yorktown&quot; were both damaged in the raid, but &quot;St. Louis&quot; was not attacked.

&quot;St. Louis&quot; was then assigned to Task Force 54, the bombardment group assigned to the preparatory attack on Okinawa. She took part in attacks on the invasion beaches, covered UDT groups, and protected minesweepers as the invasion of Okinawa neared. On 26 March, lookouts aboard &quot;St. Louis&quot; and the heavy cruiser spotted torpedo tracks, but the Japanese submarine that launched the torpedoes could not be immediately located. On 31 March, &quot;St. Louis&quot; steamed to the staging area at Kerama Retto to replenish ammunition and stores. The next day, she arrived back off Hagushi to support the landing there. &quot;St. Louis&quot; remained off the invasion beaches until 6 April, when she was detached to escort a group of minesweepers working off Iwo Jima, which had been conquered earlier that year in the Battle of Iwo Jima. The ship thereafter returned to Okinawa, where she provided gunfire support off Hagushi through mid-May. On 18 May, she was sent to Leyte to relieve the crew after more than a month of constant operations. The ship returned to Okinawa in mid-June, though the campaign there was in its final days.

Beginning in mid-July, &quot;St. Louis&quot; began to operate with Task Force 95, assigned to Task Unit 2, along with the old battleships and , and the cruisers , , and &quot;Wichita&quot;. TU 2 formed half of Task Group 95.3, together with Task Unit 1, which consisted of the escort carriers , , and . Over the course of the next month, the task group patrolled off Okinawa to defend against Japanese air attacks and conducted sweeps into the East China Sea, to search for Japanese merchant shipping and carry out strikes against targets in occupied China. In early August, &quot;St. Louis&quot; returned to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she remained through 15 August, when the end of the war was announced. Over the course of the conflict, &quot;St. Louis&quot; earned eleven battle stars.

===Post-war===
&quot;St. Louis&quot; remained in East Asian waters for more than two months after the end of the war. She moved to the Philippines in late August, where she was assigned to Task Force 73, the Yangtze River Patrol Force. She had returned to Buckner Bay by September, where other vessels that had been assigned to the unit were being collected. In October, the ships sailed to Shanghai, China, and later that month, she took part in an operation to move elements of the Chinese Army to Taiwan, which had been under Japanese occupation.

The ship was thereafter used as part of Operation Magic Carpet, the effort to repatriate American forces after the war. Her first such voyage ended at San Francisco on 9 November, and she made a further two by mid-January 1946. These included voyages to various islands in the central and southwestern Pacific. These duties completed, &quot;St. Louis&quot; left for Philadelphia in early February, arriving there on the 25th of the month. There, she was decommissioned on 20 June and moored at League Island in the Delaware River, part of the 16th (Inactive) Fleet. She remained there into the early 1950s.

===Transfer to Brazil===

In the early 1950s, as the US Navy sought to reduce the number of surplus vessels in its inventory, &quot;St. Louis&quot; was allocated to the Brazilian Navy. She was stricken from the US Naval Vessel Register on 22 January 1951 and commissioned into Brazilian service on 29 January as &quot;Almirante Tamandaré&quot;.

During a period of political instability in 1955, Carlos Luz briefly seized power after the acting president, Café Filho, fell ill on 8 November. Luz was himself deposed three days later, and he fled aboard &quot;Tamandaré&quot;, which was moored in Guanabara Bay off Rio de Janeiro, awaiting work on her boilers. At that time, the ship&#x27;s captain was Silvio Heck; also aboard was Admiral Carlos Pena Boto. Luz sought to flee the capital to Santos, and when the ship passed out of the bay, the coastal fortifications guarding its entrance opened fire on &quot;Tamandaré&quot;, but scored no hits. Luz was formally removed from power and the governor of São Paulo barred him from entering the area. &quot;Tamandaré&quot; brought him back to Rio de Janeiro on the 13th, where he left the ship.

She served as the Fleet Flagship until 1976. She was deployed as part of the force in the Lobster War between Brazil and France.

&quot;Tamandaré&quot; was stricken from the naval register in 1973 and was laid up until 1980, when she was sold to ship breakers based in Taiwan. While being towed there on 24 August, she foundered off South Africa.

<text>The Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC) is a local government-owned public service company which based in Richmond, Virginia. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

GRTC primarily serves the independent city of Richmond and a very small portion of the adjacent counties of Henrico, Hanover, and Chesterfield with a fleet of over 157 diesel-powered and CNG-powered transit buses operating approximately 45 routes. GRTC uses government-funded equipment and resources principally provided by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation (VDRPT), and local funds.

On June 24, 2018, GRTC launched its first bus rapid transit (BRT) line, the &quot;GRTC Pulse.&quot; Running 7.6 miles from Rocketts Landing to Willow Lawn, it offers high-capacity service along Broad and Main Streets and has earned a Bronze Standard BRT rating from the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP). In 2023, GRTC approved plans for a second BRT line, the North-South Pulse, which will extend 12 miles from Henrico County to Southside Plaza and Midlothian Turnpike, with construction set to begin in 2029.

== History ==
The GRTC is descended in a long line of transportation companies in Richmond. The first was established in 1860 as the Richmond Railway, a horse drawn trolley system. This line failed and was bought in 1881 by the Richmond City Railway. In 1888, a new, electrified system was built by the Richmond Union Passenger Railway. This was the first effective electric trolley system in the United States. The two companies were merged together along with three other electric and lighting companies to form the Richmond Railway and Electric Company in 1890, later reincorporated into the expanded Richmond Passenger and Power Company in 1900. One year later, the name was altered to the Virginia Passenger and Power Company, which defaulted in its payment in 1904 and was bought in 1909 by the Virginia Railway and Power Company. In 1925, ownership changed hands again and the company became the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO). By 1944, the Securities and Exchange Commission had determined that VEPCO had too much monopoly power and ordered its transportation and electric businesses to be split up. As a result, VEPCO (later rebranded to Dominion Energy) sold the streetcar business to the Virginia Transit Company (VTC). In 1949, the last streetcars stopped operating and were succeeded by gas powered buses. In 1973, the city of Richmond purchased the VTC and created the Greater Richmond Transit Company. A one half ownership interest was purchased by Chesterfield County in 1989. The Pulse, a rapid transit route running along Broad Street, was initiated in 2018.

== GRTC Pulse (Bus rapid transit) ==
The GRTC Pulse is a bus rapid transit (BRT) system serving the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area. It was launched on June 24, 2018, through a partnership between the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Commonwealth of Virginia (including the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation and the Virginia Department of Transportation), the City of Richmond, and Henrico County.

The Pulse operates along a 7.6-mile route, connecting Rocketts Landing in the City of Richmond to Willow Lawn in Henrico County, via Broad Street and Main Street. It provides a modern, high-capacity, and reliable transit service designed to improve travel times and accessibility in the region.

The GRTC Pulse has been recognized with a Bronze Standard BRT rating by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), highlighting its quality and efficiency. The service is jointly sponsored by Bon Secours Richmond Health System and VCU Health System, and connects riders to key destinations, including businesses, services, and restaurants along its route.

=== Expansion of the GRTC Pulse ===
The GRTC Pulse, Richmond&#x27;s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, is undergoing significant expansion to meet increasing demand for public transportation across the region. With existing vehicles operating at capacity, GRTC is working on a series of projects to expand and improve the Pulse network. These projects range from station modifications to accommodate larger buses to major extensions and the introduction of new routes.

==== Station modifications ====
The current 26 Pulse stations were originally designed to serve approximately 3,500 daily passengers. However, daily ridership now exceeds 6,100, leading to crowded vehicles operating at maximum capacity. To address this, GRTC announced in 2023 that they would purchase four 60-foot (18 m) New Flyer XN60 articulated buses to relieve congestion on the route. GRTC plans to eventually replace all of the 40-foot (12 m) buses used on the Pulse with XN60 buses. The new buses were scheduled to go into service in 2025.

To accommodate these larger buses, GRTC plans to modify the existing stations by removing the brick knee wall bordering the platform, ensuring all three bus doors can be utilized. Station modifications are expected to take 260 days, with completion anticipated by the summer of 2025. Construction will begin at the East Riverfront station on September 23, 2024.

==== Western extension ====
As demand for transit along West Broad Street continues to rise, GRTC, in collaboration with Henrico County, is planning a four-mile extension of the Pulse line. This extension will expand the service from Willow Lawn to Parham Road, adding eight new stations and additional dedicated bus lanes. It will also introduce a park-and-ride location, a new feature for the Pulse system. The Western Extension is currently in Phase 2 of its study, which includes preliminary design and environmental assessments under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

==== North-South Pulse ====
In 2022, studies began on a North-South BRT corridor, travelling along U.S 1 In October 2023, the GRTC Board of Directors approved the recommended route for the proposed North-South BRT.

The North-South Pulse project aims to introduce 12 miles of high-capacity rapid transit, connecting northern and southern parts of the Richmond region via downtown. The route will run from Azalea in Henrico County, down U.S. Route 1, through downtown Richmond, and across the 9th Street Bridge to Southside Plaza. It will then continue along Belt Boulevard and the Midlothian Turnpike, terminating at Springline &amp; Stonebridge. Studies on this Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor began in 2022, and by October 2023, the GRTC Board of Directors approved the recommended route. Currently in Phase 2, focusing on station location and environmental assessments, the project is slated to begin construction in 2029.

== Ownership and management ==
As a public service company, GRTC is owned equally by the City of Richmond and neighboring Chesterfield County. Henrico and Hanover counties currently purchase services from it, but hold no ownership interest.

Immediately after GRTC was formed in 1973, American Transportation Enterprises, Inc., through a subsidiary, continued to provide management. It was managed by a private transit management company that provided the CEO, COO, and Transportation Manager, as was its predecessor, Virginia Transit Company. 

GRTC itself has about 500 employees including bus operators, repair shop mechanics, customer service, support, and other administrative staff.

== Fleet ==

142 transit vehicles, 96 CARE vehicles, and 27 support vehicles (vans, wreckers, trucks, SUVs, etc)
95 fixed-route transit vehicles use CNG fuel
88 CARE vehicles use CNG fuel 

In June 2020, the GRTC Board of Directors approved to purchase a replacement bus for #2004 that was destroyed during the riots. The bus should be placed into service on the GRTC Pulse route sometime in January 2021. This bus will be a 40 ft Gillig Low Floor CNG BRTPlus model.

In August 2020, the GRTC Board of Directors approved the purchase of 29 buses to replace older buses to keep the fleet in a state of good repair, as well as to keep up with demand increases in the Richmond Area. All 29 of these buses will be 40 ft Gillig Low Floor CNG BRT model. 14 of the buses will be put into service in the 1st Quarter of FY2022, and the last 15 will enter service in the 3rd Quarter of FY2022.

== CARE and CARE Plus ==
GRTC Transit System’s CARE and CARE Plus services provide origin-to-destination service under the guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for the citizens of the Richmond Region. CARE and CARE Plus provide public transportation access to individuals with disabilities who may not be reasonably able to use GRTC fixed route bus service. All CARE trips are identified as either CARE or CARE Plus service. CARE and CARE Plus services are available in the City of Richmond, Henrico County, and portions of Chesterfield County.

== Facilities ==

The GRTC Headquarters and bus garage is located near the intersection of Belt Boulevard and Midlothian Turnpike in South Richmond.

<doc id="556445" wikidata="Q898143" url="?curid=556445" title="Good Times with Weapons">
<text>&quot;Good Times with Weapons&quot; is the first episode of the eighth season of the American animated series South Park and the 112th episode of the series. It originally aired on March 17, 2004. In the episode, the boys are transformed into Japanese warriors after they buy martial arts weapons at a local market. Their sworn enemy, Professor Chaos, confronts them and a highly stylized battle ensues. The episode&#x27;s animation routinely switches from the usual cutout-and-solid-color style to a highly stylized anime theme.

This was the first episode with April Stewart as the bulk of the female characters following Eliza Schneider&#x27;s departure. The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker. In 2015, he and co-creator Matt Stone listed it as their second favorite episode of the series. The episode was rated TV-MA L in the United States.

==Plot==
At the Park County Fair, the boys find a vendor selling East Asian weapons. The vendor says that he cannot sell weapons to people under 18 without parental approval, so the boys lie by claiming that they are brothers and that their parents died in a car accident the previous year, convincing the vendor to give them the weapons. Stan purchases a pair of Tonfa, Kyle gets nunchaku, Cartman buys a pair of sai, and Kenny purchases a pair of &quot;shaken&quot;-style shuriken. After showing their weapons off to Craig, Clyde, and Token the boys go around town pretending to be ninjas, becoming anime-like characters with their own individual superpowers. The animation style takes on an overall Japanese look and switches to a cinemascope aspect ratio whenever this happens in the original print at 4:3.

Butters sees them playing and wants to join but the boys refuse to let him. Butters then goes home and becomes his supervillain alter ego, Professor Chaos, and sets off to get his revenge on the four ninjas. Professor Chaos neutralizes Kyle and Stan, so Kenny comes to their defense and throws one of his shuriken. It hits Butters in the eye and becomes lodged in it, ending the boys&#x27; playtime. They realize that Butters needs medical attention, but taking him to the local hospital would result in their parents discovering their purchases. When an attempt to extract the shuriken from his eye fails, the boys decide to dress Butters up like a dog by gluing Sparky&#x27;s fur to him and take him to a veterinarian.

On the way, the boys encounter Craig, Jimmy, Clyde, and Token and have to hide Butters in an abandoned oven so nobody sees him. Much to their chagrin, they have copied the boys and obtained weapons from the same vendor. The two ninja groups fight, but in the midst of all the chaos, Butters escapes. The four boys force Craig&#x27;s group to help them search for Butters, threatening to tell on them if they do not. A weakened, delirious Butters makes his way to the hospital, but his disguise fools the attending doctor, who sends Butters to the local animal shelter. There, the veterinarian determines that the only thing to do is to put Butters to sleep, but Butters escapes.

The boys decide to dispose of the evidence and return to the fair to have the vendor refund their money, which he refuses to do. Craig and the others inform them that they have seen Butters wandering around on the other side of the fair towards an auction that all their parents are attending. Cartman decides to use his ninja power of invisibility to walk across the auction stage to get to Butters undetected and removes his clothes. However, in real life, Cartman inadvertently ends up streaking across the stage. Butters staggers onto the stage and collapses.

The final scene shows the townsfolk protesting at an emergency meeting at the community center due to an outrage at the auction. The boys believe the outrage in question is Butters&#x27; injury (which has been medically treated by this time), but it soon transpires that the real issue is Cartman&#x27;s public nudity. Cartman explains that it was a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; (a reference to the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy that occurred six weeks prior to the episode&#x27;s airing), and the episode ends with Stan, Kyle, and Kenny addressing the issue that adults are more offended by sex than violence, allowing them to keep their weapons after Kyle suggested that Cartman should be punished. The episode ends with a freeze-frame of Stan, Kyle, and Kenny in anime style posing.

==Production==
This episode features some ninja counterparts of the original cast of characters that appears to be modeled after the video game sprites from Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;. &quot;Let&#x27;s Fighting Love&quot; is a theme song that mixes Japanese and English lyrics in a style parody of anime theme songs including that of &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;. The song is performed by Parker.

==Home media==
&quot;Good Times with Weapons&quot;, along with the thirteen other episodes from &quot;South Park&quot;″s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. In 2006, the episode was also included in &quot;South Park – The Hits: Volume 1&quot;, a DVD compilation which features Parker and Stone&#x27;s ten favorite episodes.

On March 6, 2007, the day before the 11th season began, this episode was re-rendered in HD at 16:9 widescreen and was free with purchases of an Xbox 360 console or HD DVD Drive at Best Buy on a single HD DVD disc from March 20 to April 3. It was also free on the Xbox 360 marketplace for two weeks from March 6 to March 20.

<text>Joseph Allan Nevins (May 20, 1890 – March 5, 1971) was an American historian and journalist, known for his extensive work on the history of the Civil War and his biographies of such figures as Grover Cleveland, Hamilton Fish, Henry Ford, and John D. Rockefeller, as well as his public service. He was a leading exponent of business history and oral history.

==Biography==
Nevins was born in Camp Point, Illinois, the son of Emma (née Stahl) and Joseph Allan Nevins, whom he later described as a stern Presbyterian farmer. His father was of Scottish heritage and his mother German. After education in local public schools, Nevins attended the University of Illinois, where he earned an M.A. in English in 1913.

He married Mary Fleming (Richardson) in 1916, and the couple had two daughters, Anne Elizabeth and Meredith.

==Career==
Nevins wrote his first book, &quot;The Life of Robert Rogers&quot; (1914) (about a Colonial American frontiersman and Loyalist) and a history of the University of Illinois (1917) during his postgraduate studies in that institution.

Nevins then accepted positions with the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot; and worked as a journalist in New York City for twenty years, as well as continued writing and editing history books. He resigned from the &quot;Nation&quot; in 1918, and the &quot;Post&quot; about a year after publishing its history &quot;The Evening Post: A Century of Journalism&quot; in 1922. In 1923 Nevins published &quot;American Social History as Recorded by British Travellers&quot; (reissued as &quot;America through British Eyes&quot; in 1957) and &quot;The American States During and After the Revolution, 1775–1789&quot; in 1924.

In 1924 Nevins resigned from the &quot;Post&quot; to become literary editor of the &quot;New York Sun&quot; and about a year later gave up that position to become an editorial writer with the &quot;New York World&quot;. Nevins continued extensive private research in the New York Public Library and published &quot;The Emergence of Modern America, 1865–1878&quot; in 1927, and a biography of explorer John Charles Frémont, &quot;Frémont: The West&#x27;s Greatest Adventurer&quot; in 1928. During a leave of absence from his newspaper job, Nevins spent a term teaching American history at Cornell University. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr., arranged for Nevins to have this position.

As a journalist, Nevins covered the campaigns of Al Smith. After the 1928 Presidential Campaign which he covered for Walter Lippmann, Nevins grew dismayed at what he perceived as intolerance and provincialism, religious bigotry and racial prejudice in the American South, which as a historian he contrasted to religious freedom and separation of church and state that the same region had brought to the new nation in the revolutionary era.

In 1928, Nevins joined the history faculty of Columbia University, where he remained for three decades until his mandatory retirement in 1958. In 1931 he gave up his journalism job in order to become a full-time faculty member and in 1939 succeeded Evarts Boutell Greene (his teacher at Illinois and mentor at Columbia), as the Dewitt Clinton Professor of History. His major works during this period included: &quot;Grover Cleveland: A Study in Courage&quot; (1932, which won his first Pulitzer Prize), &quot;History of the Bank of New York and Trust Company, 1784–1934&quot; (1934), &quot;Hamilton Fish: The Inner Story of the Grant Administration&quot; (1936, which won his second Pulitzer Prize), &quot;The Gateway to History&quot; (1938), a two-volume biography of John D. Rockefeller, &quot;The Heroic Age of American Enterprise&quot; (1940; rewritten and expanded as &quot;A Study in Power: John D. Rockefeller, Industrialist and Philanthropist&quot; in 1953).

During World War II, Professor Nevins taught (as Harmsworth Professor of American History) at Oxford University from 1940 to 1941. In 1942, he published &quot;America: The Story of A Free People&quot; (with Henry Steele Commager, reworked and republished in 1954). Nevins served as special representative of the Office of War Information in Australia and New Zealand in 1943–1944, and in 1945–1946 worked in London as chief public affairs officer at the American embassy.

Upon returning to Columbia, Nevins began working on a multi-volume series on the American Civil War. The first volume &quot;The Ordeal of Union&quot; (1947) won the Bancroft Prize and a $10,000 Scribners Literary Prize. In 1948 Nevins created the first oral history program to operate on an institutionalized basis in the U.S., which continues as Columbia University&#x27;s Center for Oral History. In addition to publishing four more volumes of the Civil War series, Nevins reworked the Rockefeller biography to cast a more favorable light upon the magnate. In 1954 with Frank Hill, Nevins published the first of a three-volume biography of Henry Ford and the Ford Motor Company, &quot;Ford: The Times, the Man, and the Company&quot;.

From May 6, 1938, until August 18, 1957, Nevins hosted a 15-minute radio show &quot;Adventures in Science&quot;, which covered a wide variety of medical and scientific topics, and was broadcast as a segment of CBS&#x27; &quot;Adult Education Series&quot; various days, usually in the late afternoon.

After retiring from Columbia, Nevins relocated to California, where he worked as senior researcher at the Huntington Library in San Marino, and also returned to Oxford from 1964 to 1965. Nevins also publicly supported John F. Kennedy in the 1960 Presidential Campaign and wrote an introduction for Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;. Nevins headed the national Civil War Centennial Commission, edited its 15-volume Impact series and finished the final volumes of his eight-volume series on the American Civil War. He also published &quot;Herbert H. Lehman and His Era&quot; (1963) and &quot;James Truslow Adams: Historian of the American Dream&quot; (1968).

In 1966, Nevins received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

As an historian, Nevins supervised more than 100 doctoral dissertations, published over 50 books and possibly more than 1000 articles, as well as serving as president of the American Historical Association, the Society of American Historians, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

==Death and legacy==
Nevins died in Menlo Park, California, in 1971. He was buried at Kensico Cemetery in Westchester County, New York. The last two volumes of his Civil War series won the U.S. National Book Award in History in 1972. Historians including Ray Allen Billington compiled &quot;Allan Nevins on History&quot; (1975) to celebrate his accomplishments. His granddaughter Jane Mayer also became a journalist and author. The Society of American Historians awards an Allan Nevins Prize annually in his honor.

==Published work==
Nevins wrote more than 50 books, mainly political and business history and biography focusing on the nineteenth century, in addition to his many newspaper and academic articles. The hallmarks of his books were his extensive, in-depth research and a vigorous, almost journalistic writing style. Subjects of his biographies included: Grover Cleveland, Abram Hewitt, Hamilton Fish, Henry Ford, John C. Frémont, Herbert Lehman, John D. Rockefeller, and Henry White. The biographies cover United States political, economic and diplomatic history of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His biography of Grover Cleveland won the 1933 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, as did his biography of Hamilton Fish four years later. Nevins also published an annotated diary of President James K. Polk, and a volume of Cleveland&#x27;s correspondence spanning the years 1850–1908.

===&quot;Ordeal of the Union&quot;===
Nevins&#x27; greatest work was &quot;Ordeal of the Union&quot; (1947–1971), an 8-volume comprehensive history of the coming of the Civil war, and the war itself. (He died before he could address Reconstruction, and thus his masterwork ends in 1865.) It remains the most detailed political, economic and military narrative of the era. Nevins&#x27;s &quot;Ordeal of the Union&quot; has a slight but perceptible pro-Union bias, just as Shelby Foote&#x27;s three-volume masterwork has a slight but perceptible bias towards the Confederacy.
The last two volumes jointly won the 1972 U.S. National Book Award in History.

Nevins also planned and helped to edit a pioneering 13-volume series exploring American social history, &quot;A History of American Life&quot;.

His biographer explained Nevins&#x27; style: 

Nevins used narrative not only to tell a story but to propound moral lessons. It was not his inclination to deal in intellectual concepts or theories, like many academic scholars. He preferred emphasizing practical notions about the importance of national unity, principled leadership, [classical] liberal politics, enlightened journalism, the social responsibility of business and industry, and scientific and technical progress that added to the cultural improvement of humanity.

===John D. Rockefeller===
Nevins wrote several books on John D. Rockefeller and the Rockefeller family, including a two-volume authorized biography of John D. Rockefeller. Business journalist Ferdinand Lundberg later criticized Nevins for deferring to power and thereby misleading readers. By contrast, historian Priscilla Roberts argues that his studies of inventors and businessmen brought about a reassessment of American industrialization and its leaders. She writes: 
:Nevins argued that economic development in the United States caused relatively little human suffering, while raising the general standard of living and making the United States the great industrial power capable of defeating Germany in both world wars. The great capitalists of that period should, he argued, be viewed, not as &quot;robber barons&quot;, but as men whose economic self-interest had played an essentially, positive role in American history, and who had done nothing criminal by the standards of their time.

In contending that Rockefeller did &quot;nothing criminal&quot;, in light of his central role in the Ludlow Massacre, Nevins seems to have equated non-prosecution with innocence.

Historians and biographers who followed Nevins&#x27; lead include Jean Strouse, Ron Chernow, David Nasaw, and T. J. Stiles, chronicling the lives and careers of such figures as J. Pierpont Morgan, John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and Cornelius Vanderbilt. Though these later biographers did not confer heroic status on their subjects, they used historical and biographical investigations to establish a more complex understanding of the American past, and the history of American economic development in particular.

===John F. Kennedy===
An enthusiastic supporter of then-Senator John F. Kennedy, Nevins wrote the foreword to the inaugural edition of Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;. He also joined his friend, frequent co-editor, and Columbia colleague Henry Steele Commager in organizing &quot;Professors for Kennedy&quot;, a political advocacy group in the 1960 presidential election. In the late 1960s Nevins and Commager parted ways over the issue of the Vietnam War, a war that Commager opposed on constitutional grounds, while Nevins thought it necessary in the Cold War against Communism.

<text>In filmmaking, a double is a person who substitutes for another actor such that the person&#x27;s face is not shown. There are various terms associated with a double based on the specific body part or ability they serve as a double for, such as stunt double, &quot;dance double&quot;, &quot;butt double&quot; and &quot;hand double&quot;.

== Types of doubles ==

=== Body double ===

A body double or photography double is used in certain specific shots to replace the credited actor of a character. The body double&#x27;s face is obscured to maintain the illusion that they are the same character; usually by shooting their body at an angle that leaves their face out (such as by showing the body double from the back) or in post-production by superimposing the original actor&#x27;s face over the body double&#x27;s. The double&#x27;s face is usually not seen on-camera, particularly when they do not facially resemble the actor; a wig will usually be employed if the double&#x27;s hair color is different from that of the main actor. This is in contrast to a stand-in, who replaces an actor for non-filming purposes such as scene arrangement and lighting adjustments.
A body double must sometimes be able to recite his or her lines with the same timing as the actor, and also reproduce the exact physical actions in co-ordination with the other principal actors; usually, doubles must have a strong resemblance to the actor they replace. An extensively used body double, especially when used in cases where the credited actor is unavailable, unwilling to film or has died, is known as a fake Shemp.

A double can be used for cases where special skills are needed—such as playing musical instruments, dancing or other athletic abilities. Also, if only a part of the body is shown, the term for the double might be more specific. A common double is a &quot;hand double&quot;, who is used to shoot inserts where only the hand or arm is in the shot. These inserts are often shot by the second unit with a double at a later point in production primarily because it allows the main unit to use the lead actors&#x27; time more efficiently.

Body doubles are often used for shots involving nudity. The reasons for this vary. Actors&#x27; nude bodies may have too many physical flaws and imperfections that would show on camera, especially due to aging, while some actors are uncomfortable performing nude. A common body double is the &quot;butt double&quot;, mostly used with TV, since whole-body nudity is less common in that medium. The term &quot;stunt butt&quot; is also attested, as is &quot;stunt cock&quot;.

In some productions, a scene calls for two characters in the same shot who are portrayed by a single actor. A body double can portray one of the characters, while the credited actor plays the other, thus enabling both characters to appear simultaneously on camera. An unusual example of body doubling took place in the movie &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991). A scene requiring Linda Hamilton to appear as two Sarah Connors in the same scene was created by employing Hamilton&#x27;s identical twin sister Leslie as her double. This has become less common with digital editing currently available which can splice together multiple takes, allowing for an actor to perform as each character in separate takes that are joined to create the image of the characters in same setting, such as with Deep Roy, who portrayed the Oompa-Loompas in &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; (2005).

The 1984 film &quot;Body Double&quot;, directed by Brian De Palma, featured a plot that hinged on the discovery that one character had in fact served as a body double for another.

=== Stunt double ===
A stunt double is often a stunt performer, specifically a skilled replacement, used for dangerous sequences or other sophisticated stunts (especially fight scenes). Stunt doubles may be used in cases where an actor&#x27;s physical condition or age precludes much activity, or when an actor is contractually prohibited from taking certain risks.

Stunt doubles should be distinguished from daredevils, who perform stunts for the sake of the stunt alone, often as a career. Sequences often do not place stunt doubles in the same mortal peril as the characters: for example, harnesses and wires can be digitally removed from the final film.

Many stunt doubles have long production careers as part of a star actor&#x27;s contractual &quot;support crew&quot;, along with the star&#x27;s cooks, trainers, dressers, and assistants. Often stunt doubles have to look like their respective actors, in order to maintain the illusion that it is the actor on-screen. Stunt doubles for Eddie Murphy, John Wayne, Harrison Ford, Steve Martin, Salman Khan and Michael Landon have been associated with their lead actors for decades.

Sometimes stunt doubles are cast in small roles apart from the actor they double for. In the episode &quot;The Trouble with Tribbles&quot; (1967) of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series (1966-1969), William Shatner&#x27;s stunt double Paul Baxley was cast as Ensign Freeman, a minor character primarily seen during a bar fight. 

Non-humans are also known to have stunt doubles. For example, Enzo was the stunt double for his aging sire Moose on the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; (1993-2004). Soccer, the Jack Russell terrier on &quot;Wishbone&quot; (1995-1997), reportedly hated swimming and therefore had stunt doubles.

=== Dance double ===
A dance double performs physically difficult dancing.

The &quot;Black Swan&quot; dance double controversy brought significant attention to dance doubles. After the 83rd Academy Awards, in which Natalie Portman won the Oscar for Best Actress for her role in &quot;Black Swan&quot; (2010) as a ballerina, controversy arose over how much credit for the dancing in the film was being given to her and how much to her &quot;dance double&quot;, American Ballet Theatre soloist Sarah Lane.

Prior to &quot;Black Swan&quot;, there had also been dance doubles in other films. In &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983), Jennifer Beals’ dancing was doubled by Marine Jahan and, at one point, the male dancer Crazy Legs for a difficult break dancing sequence.

<doc id="556448" wikidata="Q434393" url="?curid=556448" title="Altan Khan">
<text>Altan Khan of the Tümed (2 January 1508 – 13 January 1582; ; Chinese: 阿勒坦汗), whose given name was Anda (Mongolian: Алтан (Аньда); Chinese: 俺答), was the leader of the Tümed Mongols de facto ruler of the Right Wing, or western tribes, of the Mongols, and the first Ming Shunyi King (順義王). He was the grandson of Dayan Khan (1464–1543), a descendant of Kublai Khan (1215–1294), who had managed to unite a tribal league between the Khalkha Mongols in the north and the Chahars (Tsakhars) to the south. His name means &quot;Golden Khan&quot; in the Mongolian language.

== Consolidation of power ==
Borjigin Barsboladiin Altan was the second son of Bars Bolud Jinong, and a grandson of Batumongke Dayan Khan who had re-unified the Mongolian nobility in an attempt to regain the glory of the Yuan dynasty. Altan Khan ruled the Tümed and belonged to the Right Wing of the Mongols along with his elder brother Gün Bilig, who ruled the Ordos. After Gün Bilig&#x27;s death in 1542, Altan became the de facto leader of the whole of the Right Wing and was given the title, &quot;Tösheetü Sechen Khan&quot;.

When Bodi Alagh Khan, the Khagan of the Mongols from the Chahar, died in 1547, Altan forced Bodi Alagh&#x27;s successor Darayisung Küdeng Khan to flee eastward. In 1551 Darayisung made a compromise with Altan in exchange for giving the title &quot;Gegeen Khan&quot; to him. Altan Khan, who controlled the Ordos tumen of the Huang He or Yellow River was well placed to keep pressure on the Chinese and the Oirat Mongols in Tibet while developing both agriculture and trade.

Altan Khan also founded the city of Köke Khota (Hohhot, meaning &quot;The Blue City&quot;), now the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. There is an impressive statue of him in one of the city&#x27;s main squares.

==Relations with Ming China==

Altan Khan led raids into the Ming dynasty in 1529, 1530 and 1542 returning with plunder and livestock. In 1550 he crossed the Great Wall and besieged Beijing, setting the suburbs on fire. In 1552 Altan Khan gained control of the remains of Karakorum, the old Mongol capital. Longqing Emperor, the reigning emperor of the Ming dynasty, was forced to grant special trading rights to the khanate, which allowed it to trade horses for silks, further strengthening it economically. After grandson Bǎhànnàjí (把汉那吉) was surrenderred to the Ming, wife of Altan Khan, Khatun (克哈屯) was afraid that Bǎhànnàjí would be killed by the Ming. Han official Zhao Quan (赵全) under Altan Khan suggested to attack Ming to get Bǎhànnàjí back. After verifying the fact that Bǎhànnàjí was appointed as a commander of the Ming, Altan Khan told Bao Chongde (鲍崇德) that if he was betowed as a king of the Ming, he would become official and follow order of the Ming, and never betray. He also broke an arrow as a pledge, saying if he broke his promise, he would be broken like the arrow. In 1570 (隆慶四年), event Anda Feng Gong (Chinese:俺答封贡) occurred after Grandson Bǎhànnàjí returned to Altan Khan, and Han officials including Zhao Quan under Altan Khan were executed the next day by the Ming. In 1571, Altan Khan agreed to pay tribute to the Ming, and the title Shunyi King (&quot;king who conforms to righteousness&quot;) and seal of authority were granted to him by the Longqing Emperor (March 4, 1537 – July 5, 1572), the 12th emperor of China (Ming dynasty). The emperor also gave Altan Khan&#x27;s new capital a new name, Guihua, meaning &quot;return to civilization&quot;. More than 60 other people including Altan Khan&#x27;s brother and nephew were also assigned with high official positions of the Ming. As requested by Altan Khan, his son Sengge Düüreng was also granted official position from Ming. Grandson Bǎhànnàjí was appointed as General by the Ming and continued to command as before.

Altan Khan&#x27;s submission to the Ming dynasty in 1570 was largely nominal, as he retained significant autonomy. While he acknowledged Ming authority and paid tribute, the arrangement was mutually beneficial, with the Ming offering trade privileges. In reality, the Ming had little control over Altan Khan&#x27;s actions or policies.


== Alliance with the Gelug ==
Altan Khan is particularly remembered for establishing ties between Mongolia and the religious leaders of the Tibetan Gelug order. He became very interested in the Gelug, and Beijing was happy to provide him with Tibetan lamas (teachers), Tibetan scriptures, and translations. Altan Khan first invited Sonam Gyatso to Tümed in 1569, but apparently he refused to go and sent a disciple instead, who reported back to him about the great opportunity to spread Buddhist teachings throughout Mongolia.

In 1573, Altan Khan took some Tibetan Buddhist monks prisoner.

Sonam Gyatso accepted Altan Khan&#x27;s invitation to Tümed in 1577. Altan Khan later had Thegchen Chonkhor, Mongolia&#x27;s first monastery, built at the place of the meeting. Also, the ruler of the Khalkha Mongols, Abtai Sain Khan, rushed to Tümed to meet the Dalai Lama. The Erdene Zuu Monastery was built by him in 1586, at the site of the former Mongol capital of Karakorum following his adoption of Buddhism as the state religion. This monastery is also often (wrongly) referred to as the first monastery in Mongolia and it grew into a massive establishment. In 1792, it contained 68 temples and some 15,000 lamas.

Sonam Gyatso publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of the Tibetan Sakya monk Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280) who had converted Kublai Khan. He also claimed Altan Khan was a reincarnation of Kublai Khan (1215–1294), the famous ruler of the Mongol Empire and Emperor of China, and that they had come together again to cooperate in propagating the Buddhist religion.

Altan Khan designated Sonam Gyatso as &quot;Dalai&quot; (a translation into Mongolian of the name Gyatso, meaning &quot;ocean&quot;) in 1578, and in October 1587, as requested by the family of Altan Khan, Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso was promoted to Duǒ Er Zhǐ Chàng (Chinese:朵儿只唱) by the emperor of China, seal of authority and golden sheets were granted. As a result, Sonam Gyatso became known as the Dalai Lama which, since then, has been used as a title – frequently translated into English as &quot;Ocean of Wisdom&quot;. The title was also posthumously given to Gendun Drup and Gendun Gyatso, who were considered Sonam Gyatso&#x27;s previous incarnations. Thus, Sonam Gyatso was recognized as being already the 3rd Dalai Lama.

Sonam Gyatso never returned to Tibet but remained proselytizing among the Mongols. The Tümed Mongols and their allies were brought into the Gelug tradition, which was to become the main spiritual orientation of the Mongols in the ensuing centuries.

Sonam Gyatso&#x27;s message was that the time had come for Mongolia to embrace Buddhism, that from that time on there should be no more animal sacrifices, there must be no taking of life, animal or human, military action must be pursued only with purpose and the immolation of women on the funeral pyres of their husbands must be abolished. He also secured an edict abolishing the Mongol custom of blood-sacrifices. &quot;These and many other such laws were set forth by Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso and were instituted by Altan Khan.&quot;

A massive program of translating Tibetan (and Sanskrit) texts into Mongolian was commenced, with letters written in silver and gold and paid for by the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Mongolian devotees. Within 50 years virtually all Mongols had become Buddhist, with tens of thousands of monks, who were members of the Gelug order, loyal to the Dalai Lama.

When Sonam Gyatso died in 1588, his incarnation – and thus, the new Dalai Lama – was Altan Khan&#x27;s great-grandson.

==Death==
Altan Khan died in 13 January 1582, only eleven years after becoming Shunyi King of Ming China, and only four years after meeting with the Third Dalai Lama. He was 74 or 75 years old at the time.

==Succession==

Altan Khan&#x27;s title Shunyi Wang (順義王) was succeeded by his son Sengge Düüreng who was supported by the Ming court of China. Altan Khan&#x27;s great-grandson, Yonten Gyatso, was selected as the 4th Dalai Lama.

== Altan Khan Plaza ==

In order to commemorate Altan Khan&#x27;s great contribution to Hohhot, in September 2011, a seated statue of Altan Khan donated by an enterprise was completed in the square in front of the Dazhao Temple. The heroic achievements of Altan Khan are recorded under the bronze statue. Everyone who comes to Hohhot will see the seated statue of Altan Khan.

<text>Pantaleón Enrique Joaquín Granados Campiña (27 July 1867 – 24 March 1916), commonly known as Enrique Granados in Spanish or &quot;Enric Granados&quot; in Catalan, was a Spanish composer of classical music, and concert pianist from Catalonia, Spain. His most well-known works include &quot;Goyescas&quot;, the &quot;&quot;, and &quot;María del Carmen&quot;.

== Life ==

Pantaleón Enrique Joaquín Granados Campiña was born in Lleida, Spain, the son of Calixto José de la Trinidad Granados y Armenteros, a Spanish army captain who was born in Havana, Cuba, and Enriqueta Elvira Campiña de Herrera, from Santander, Spain. As a young man he studied piano in Barcelona, where his teachers included Francisco Jurnet and Joan Baptista Pujol. In 1887 he went to Paris to study. He was unable to become a student at the Paris Conservatoire, but he was able to take private lessons with a conservatoire professor, Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot, whose mother, the soprano Maria Malibran, was of Spanish ancestry. Bériot insisted on extreme refinement in tone production, which strongly influenced Granados&#x27;s teaching of pedal technique. He also fostered Granados&#x27;s abilities in improvisation. Just as important were his studies with Felip Pedrell. He returned to Barcelona in 1889. His first successes were at the end of the 1890s, with the opera &quot;María del Carmen&quot;, which attracted the attention of King Alfonso XIII.

In 1903, Granados participated in a competition organized by Tomás Bretón of the Madrid Royal Conservatory, which awarded a considerable sum of 500 pesetas for the best &quot;concert allegro&quot; for solo piano. Granados submitted his &quot;Allegro de concierto&quot;, Op. 46, for which the jury declared him the winner with an almost unanimous vote. The win brought Granados to national attention.

In 1911 Granados premiered his suite for piano &quot;Goyescas&quot;, which became his most famous work. It is a set of six pieces based on paintings of Francisco Goya. Such was the success of this work that he was encouraged to expand it. He wrote an opera based on the subject in 1914, but the outbreak of World War I forced the European premiere to be canceled. It was performed for the first time in New York City on 28 January 1916 and was very well received. Shortly afterwards, he was invited to perform a piano recital for President Woodrow Wilson. Before leaving New York, Granados also made live-recorded player piano music rolls for the New-York-based Aeolian Company&#x27;s &quot;Duo-Art&quot; system, all of which survive today and can be heard – his last recordings.

==Death==
A delay in New York, incurred by accepting a recital invitation, caused him to miss his boat back to Spain. Instead, he took a ship to England, where he boarded the passenger ferry SS &quot;Sussex&quot; for Dieppe, France. On the way across the English Channel, the &quot;Sussex&quot; was torpedoed by a German U-boat, as part of the German World War I policy of unrestricted submarine warfare. According to witness Daniel Sargent, Granados&#x27;s wife, Amparo, was too heavy to get into a lifeboat. Granados refused to leave her and positioned her on a small life raft on which she knelt and he clung. Both then drowned within sight of other passengers. However, according to a different account from another survivor, &quot;A survivor of the 1916 torpedo attack on a Cross channel ferry, Sussex, recognised Spanish composer Granados in a lifeboat, his wife in the water. Granados dived in to save her and perished.&quot;

The personal papers of Enrique Granados are preserved in, among other institutions, the National Library of Catalonia.

== Music and influence ==
Granados wrote piano music, chamber music (a piano quintet, a piano trio, music for violin and piano), songs, zarzuelas, and an orchestral tone poem based on Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Many of his piano compositions have been transcribed for the classical guitar; examples include &quot;Dedicatoria&quot;, &quot;Danza No. 5&quot;, and &quot;Goyescas&quot;.

His music can be divided into three styles or periods:
#A romantic style including such pieces as &quot;Escenas Románticas&quot; and &quot;Escenas Poeticas&quot;.
#A more typically nationalist, Spanish style including such pieces as &quot;Danzas Españolas&quot; (Spanish Dances), &quot;6 Piezas sobre cantos populares españoles&quot; (Six Pieces based on popular Spanish songs).
#The Goya (Goyesca) period, which includes the piano suite &quot;Goyescas&quot;, the opera &quot;Goyescas&quot;, various &quot;Tonadillas&quot; for voice and piano, and other works.

Granados was a significant influence on at least two other famous Spanish composers and musicians, Manuel de Falla and Pablo Casals. He was also the teacher of composer Rosa García Ascot.

<text>Ordeal of the Union is an eight-volume series of books (published 1947–1971) on mid-19th century American history, and particularly on the American Civil War and its background, written by historian Allan Nevins. Two further volumes, intended to cover the Reconstruction era were planned, but not written as a result of Nevins&#x27;s 1971 death. The first two books in the series have the collective title &quot;Ordeal of the Union&quot; (with differing subtitles), the third and fourth the collective title &quot;The Emergence of Lincoln&quot;, and the fifth through the eighth the collective title &quot;The War for the Union&quot;; the series is, however, generally referred to as &quot;Ordeal of the Union&quot; as a whole, and the individual volumes have also been republished under this umbrella title.

The individual books are:
# &quot;Ordeal of the Union: Fruits of Manifest Destiny, 1847–1852&quot; (1947)
# &quot;Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing, 1852–1857&quot; (1947)
# &quot;The Emergence of Lincoln: Douglas, Buchanan, and Party Chaos, 1857–1859&quot; (1950)
# &quot;The Emergence of Lincoln: Prologue to Civil War, 1859–1861&quot; (1950)
# &quot;The War for the Union: The Improvised War, 1861–1862&quot; (1959)
# &quot;The War for the Union: War Becomes Revolution, 1862–1863&quot; (1960)
# &quot;The War for the Union: The Organized War, 1863–1864&quot; (1971)
# &quot;The War for the Union: The Organized War to Victory, 1864–1865&quot; (1971)

For the last two volumes, published in 1971, Nevins won the U.S. National Book Award in History.

<text>The Aru Islands Regency () is a group of about 95 low-lying islands in the Maluku Islands of eastern Indonesia. It also forms a regency of Maluku Province, with a land area of . At the 2011 Census the Regency had a population of 84,138; the 2020 Census produced a total of 102,237, and the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 108,834. Some sources regard the archipelago as part of Asia, while others regard it as part of Melanesia.

== Geography ==
The Aru Islands are the easternmost archipelago in Maluku province, and are located in the Arafura Sea south of West Papua (province), New Guinea and north of Australia. The total area of the islands is 6,426.77 km2 (2,481.39 sq mi). The largest island is Tanahbesar (also called Wokam); Dobo, the chief port of the islands, is on Wamar, just off Tanahbesar. The other five main islands are Kola, Kobroor, Maikoor, Koba, and Trangan. The main islands rise to low hills, and are separated by meandering channels. Geologically, unlike the rest of Maluku, the group is part of the Australian continent, along with New Guinea, Tasmania, Waigeo, and Raja Ampat on the Australian Plate.

Aru is covered by a mix of tropical moist broadleaf forests, savanna, and mangroves. The islands lie on the Australia-New Guinea continental shelf, and were connected to Australia and New Guinea by land when sea levels were lower during the ice ages. The flora and fauna of Aru are part of the Australasian realm, and closely related to that of New Guinea. Aru is part, together with much of western New Guinea, of the Vogelkop-Aru lowland rain forests terrestrial ecoregion.

As part of the political and administrative decentralization of Indonesia since Suharto stepped down in 1998, the Aru Islands were created as a separate regency (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) on 18 December 2003, headquartered at Dobo, and split off from the Southeast Maluku Regency.

== History ==

The Aru Islands have a long history as a part of extensive trading networks throughout what is now eastern Indonesia. Precolonial links were especially strong to the Banda Islands, and Bugis and Makasarese traders also visited regularly. The traditional society was not pronounced hierarchical, being based on lineage-based clans where the members shared duties of hospitality and cooperation. These island communities were divided into two ritual bonds called Ursia and Urlima, a socio-political system found in many parts of Maluku. Such alliances were connected to pre-European trade networks.

The islands were sighted and also possibly visited by some Portuguese navigators, such as Martim Afonso de Melo, in 1522–24, who sighted the islands and wintered on a nearby island or of the Aru archipelago itself, and possibly by Gomes de Sequeira, in 1526, as is pointed out in the cartography of the time. The Spanish navigator Álvaro de Saavedra sighted the islands on 12 June 1528, when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain.

The islands were colonized by the Dutch, beginning with a contract with the west coast villages in 1623, though initially the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was one of several trading groups in the area, with limited influence over the islands&#x27; internal affairs. Aru was monitored by the VOC establishment in the Banda Islands, and yielded a variety of products including trepang, birds-of-paradise, parrots, pearls, sago, turtle-shell, and slaves. A Dutch post was established on Wokam Island in 1659, and a small fort was subsequently constructed there. Islam as well as Reformed Protestantism began to make small numbers of converts in the 1650s. Discontent with the commercial monopolies imposed by the VOC came to a boiling point in the late 18th century. The anti-Dutch rebellion of the Tidore prince Nuku (d. 1805), which engulfed much of Maluku, also affected Aru. The Muslim population of Ujir Island accepted Nuku&#x27;s brother Jou Mangofa as their king, exterminated the Dutch garrison in 1787, and were able to dominate large parts of the islands. After several failed attempts, the Dutch of Banda managed to suppress the rebels in 1791. However, they soon ran into new trouble with the coastal populations in the east, and their control of Aru affairs was disrupted by British intervention in the East Indies after 1795.

After being left to its own devices for many years, Aru was again visited in 1824 by the Dutch naval officer A.J. Bik, who concluded a number of agreements with local chiefs. In 1857 the famous naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace visited the islands. His visit later made him realize that the Aru Islands must have been connected by a land bridge to mainland New Guinea during the ice age.

In the nineteenth century, Dobo, Aru&#x27;s largest town, temporarily became an important regional trading center, serving as a meeting point for Dutch, Makasarese, Chinese, and other traders. The period from the 1880s to 1917 saw a backlash against this outside influence, by a spiritually-based movement among local residents to rid the islands of outsiders.

== Economy ==

Throughout its history, the Aru Islands exported luxury natural products like birds-of-paradise, turtle shells, and pearls to Asia and later Europe. While the islands were positioned within the global trade network, local Aru society was able to preserve its independence and egalitarianism.

Pearl farming continues to provide a major source of income for the islands. The Aru pearl industry has been criticized in the national media for allegedly maintaining exploitative debt structures that bind the local men who dive for pearls to outside boat owners and traders in an unequal relationship.

Other export products include sago, coconuts, tobacco, mother of pearl, &quot;trepang&quot; (an edible sea cucumber, which is dried and cured), tortoiseshell, and bird-of-paradise plumes.

In November 2011, the Government of Indonesia awarded two oil-and-gas production-sharing contracts (PSC) about west of the Aru Islands to BP. The two adjacent offshore exploration PSCs, West Aru I and II, cover an area of about with water depths ranging from . BP plans to acquire seismic data over the two blocks.

== Demographics ==
The islands had a population of 84,138 at the 2010 Census;&gt; the 2020 Census produced a total of 102,237, and the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 108,834. Most indigenous islanders are of mixed Austronesian and Papuan descent. Fourteen languages – Barakai, Batuley, Dobel, Karey, Koba, Kola, Kompane, Lola, Lorang, Manombai, Mariri, East Tarangan, West Tarangan, and Ujir – are indigenous to Aru. They belong to the Central Malayo-Polynesian languages, and are related to the other languages of Maluku, Nusa Tenggara, and Timor. Ambonese Malay is also spoken on Wamar. All are members of the Austronesian language family.

The population is mostly Christian with a small Muslim minority. Figures cited by Glenn Dolcemascolo for 1993 were approximately 90% Protestant, 6% Catholic, and 4% Muslim. A more recent report from 2007 suggested that the 4% Muslim figure may only relate to the indigenous population and that the actual percentage of Muslims may be significantly higher.

In 2010 census, religion population consists Protestant (59.84%), Catholic (9.32%), Muslim (29.97%), Hinduism (0.05%), Buddhist (0.03%), Confucianism (0.02%), Other (0.01%), and not asked (0.75%).

Islam is thought to have been introduced to the islands in the late 15th century. By the early 17th century, it was reported by the Dutch that Makassarese seafarers had converted some locals and constructed mosques. However, it only took root in the mid-17th century, primarily in the Ujir-speaking territory on the western side.

The Dutch brought Christianity in the 17th and 18th centuries but much of the conversion of the population to Christianity did not take place until the 20th century.

==Administration==
At the time of the 2010 Census, the regency was divided into seven districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), but subsequently an additional three districts have been created by the splitting of existing districts. The districts are tabulated below with their areas (in km2) and their populations at the 2010 Census and 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative villages in each district (totaling 80 rural &quot;desa&quot; and 2 urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;), and its postal code.
Notes: (a) including 2 &quot;kelurahan&quot; – Galai Dubu and Siwa Lima. (b) the 2010 population of Aru Utara Timur Batuley and Sir-Sir Districts are included in the figure for Aru Utara District, from which they were split. (c) the 2010 population of Aru Selatan Utara District is included in the figures for the districts from which it was split.

<doc id="556455" wikidata="Q4809880" url="?curid=556455" title="Association of Late-Deafened Adults">
<text>Association of Late-Deafened Adults (ALDA) is an organization for people who become deaf after childhood. ALDA was founded in 1987 by Bill Graham and Kathie Hering of Chicago, Illinois. Within a few years, the organization had chapters in over 15 regions across the United States. The primary growth vehicle was ALDA News, a monthly newsletter.

By 1989 ALDA had begun holding annual conventions, known as ALDAcons. People from throughout the world have attended these conventions, which feature workshops, an exhibit hall, and social activities. The climax of the conventions is a Saturday night party featuring karaoke. I. King Jordan, president emeritus of Gallaudet University, is one of the most famous ALDAn members and has spoken frequently at the conventions. The Association presents a yearly award in his name to a member who has shown outstanding achievement as a role model for late-deafened adults.

The former president of Gallaudet, Alan Hurwitz, is also a regular convention attendee.

Most recently, the Association of Late-Deafened Adults has been involved in Congressional hearings for technological improvements, such as movie theater captioning devices for theaters, and working with the Georgia Institute of Technology for a text conversion program for Google Glass.

<doc id="556459" wikidata="Q4046133" url="?curid=556459" title="P-38 can opener">
<text>The P-38 (larger variant known as the P-51) is a small can opener that was issued with canned United States military rations from its introduction in 1942 to the end of canned ration issuance in the 1980s. Originally designed for and distributed in the K-ration, it was later included in the C-ration. The lightweight, tiny, P-38 foldable military can opener was designed and patented by J.W.SPEAKER Corp. (who also designed and patented the &quot;HEATAB&quot; dry fuel tablets used to heat the U.S. Military rations during World War II). As of 2024, it is still in production and sold worldwide.

== Design ==

The P-38 is known as a &quot;John Wayne&quot; by the United States Marine Corps, because of its toughness and dependability. The can opener is pocket-sized, approximately long, and consists of a short metal blade that serves as a handle, with a small, hinged metal tooth that folds out to pierce the can lid.

A notch just under the hinge point keeps the opener hooked around the rim of the can as the device is &quot;walked&quot; around to cut the lid out. A larger version called the P-51 is somewhat easier to operate. The handle portion can also double as a makeshift flat-blade screwdriver, with limited ability because of the rather soft sheet metal used.

Official military designations for the P-38 include &quot;U.S. ARMY POCKET CAN OPENER&quot; and &quot;OPENER, CAN, HAND, FOLDING, TYPE I&quot;. As with some other military terms (e.g., &quot;jeep&quot;), the origin of the term is not known with certainty. The P-38 opener coincidentally shares a designation with the Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter plane, which could allude to its fast performance; additionally the P-51 can opener also has an aircraft namesake in the North American P-51 Mustang.

One explanation for the origin of the name is that the P-38 is approximately 38 millimeters long. This explanation also holds for the P-51, which measures approximately in length. However, use of the metric system in the U.S. was not widespread at this point, and United States Army sources indicate that the origin of the name is rooted in the 38 punctures around the circumference of a C-ration can required for opening.
P-38s are no longer used for individual rations by the U.S. military, as canned C-rations were replaced by MRE rations in the 1980s, packed in plastic pouches. The larger P-51s are included with United States military &quot;Tray Rations&quot; (canned bulk meals). They are also still seen in disaster recovery efforts and have been handed out alongside canned food by rescue organizations, both in the U.S. and abroad.

The iconic P-38 can opener was designed, patented and manufactured by J.W. Speaker Corporation of Germantown, Wisconsin (stamped &quot;Speaker USA&quot;) and was also manufactured by Washburn Corporation (marked &quot;US Androck&quot;); they were later made by Mallin Shelby Hardware inc (defunct 1973) of Shelby, Ohio and were variously stamped &quot;US Mallin Shelby O.&quot; or &quot;U.S. Shelby Co.&quot;

== Advantages ==
The P-38 is cheaper to manufacture than a standard can opener, and is smaller and lighter to carry. The device can be easily attached to a keychain or dog tag chain using the small punched hole.

== Usage ==

The P-38 is easily used. First, the cutting point is pivoted to its 95-degree position, from its stowed, folded position. Then, for a right-handed user, the P-38 is held in the right hand by the flat long section, with the cutting point pointing downward and away from the user, while also hooking the edge of the can through the circular notch located on the flat long section next to the cutting edge. The can is held in the left hand, and the right hand is rotated slightly clockwise, causing the can lid to be punctured.

The can is then rotated counter-clockwise in the left hand, while the right hand rotates alternatively slightly counter-clockwise and slightly clockwise, until the can has been rotated nearly 360 degrees and the lid is nearly free. The lid of the now opened can is lifted, most often with the P-38 cutting edge, and the P-38 is wiped clean, and the cutting point is rotated back to its stowed, folded position. The P-38 is then returned to its stored location, whether that is dangling on a dog tag chain around one&#x27;s neck, or in one&#x27;s pocket if the P-38 is attached to a key ring.

Left-handed users simply hold the P-38 in their left hand, with the cutting point aimed towards themselves, while holding the can to be opened in their right hand, while also reversing the sense of the cutting hand movements just described. By tradition, 38 cuts as just described were supposedly required to open a can of C-Rations.

A left-handed user is at a slight disadvantage in that the tip of the thumb (instead of the lateral flank of the distal index finger) must apply the combined travel &amp; twist forces. Righties&#x27; thumbs take only the twist force.

== Similar devices ==

A similar device that incorporates a small spoon at one end and a bottle opener at the other is currently employed by the Australian Defence Force and New Zealand Army in its ration kits. The Field Ration Eating Device is known by the acronym &quot;FRED&quot;. It is also known widely in its derogatory backronym, the &quot;Fucking Ridiculous Eating Device&quot;.

Another similar device was included with British Army &quot;Operational Ration Pack, General Purpose&quot; 24-hour ration pack and &quot;Compo&quot; Composite (14 man) Ration pack rations. At one stage they were manufactured by W.P. Warren Engineering Co. Ltd, Birmingham, England. The instructions printed on the miniature greaseproof paper bag they were supplied in read:

TO OPEN CAN:
Place opener on the can with rim of can inside the slot. Hold between thumb and forefinger and twist forward to puncture. Repeat motion until can is open.

It takes approximately 38 twists to fully open a C-ration can. Their design is similar, but not identical, to the P-38 and P-51 can openers.

The Swedish army also employed a similar variant of this opener. Its official designation is M7481-021000 &quot;Konservbrytare Mini&quot; which was distributed with the notorious &quot;Golden Cans&quot; (Swedish field rations were packaged in metallic tins with a golden hue). In 1924, a similar device was featured in &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, with no mention of a military provenance.

An opener similar to the P-38, but with a non-folding blade, was popular in Poland for years. It can still be found in shops as well as the butterfly-type openers.

It has been accused of copying because there are many similarities with the revolutionary pocket can opener, advertised as being for explorers, &quot;Explorador español&quot;, manufactured in Spain in 1906, designed by D. José Valle Armesto, which would become the first pocket can opener, due to its lightness and versatility, as it allowed, in addition to opening cans, to do the same with bottle caps or act as a screwdriver.

<doc id="556462" wikidata="Q441127" url="?curid=556462" title="Paul Lévy (mathematician)">
<text>Paul Pierre Lévy (15 September 1886 – 15 December 1971) was a French mathematician who was active especially in probability theory, introducing fundamental concepts such as local time, stable distributions and characteristic functions. Lévy processes, Lévy flights, Lévy measures, Lévy&#x27;s constant, the Lévy distribution, the Lévy area, the Lévy arcsine law, and the fractal Lévy C curve are named after him.

== Biography ==

Lévy was born in Paris to a Jewish family which already included several mathematicians. His father Lucien Lévy was an examiner at the École Polytechnique. Lévy attended the École Polytechnique and published his first paper in 1905, at the age of nineteen, while still an undergraduate, in which he introduced the Lévy–Steinitz theorem. His teacher and advisor was Jacques Hadamard. After graduation, he spent a year in military service and then studied for three years at the École des Mines, where he became a professor in 1913.

During World War I Lévy conducted mathematical analysis work for the French Artillery. In 1920 he was appointed Professor of Analysis at the École Polytechnique, where his students included Benoît Mandelbrot and Georges Matheron. He remained at the École Polytechnique until his retirement in 1959, with a gap during World War II after his 1940 firing because of the Vichy anti-Jewish legislation.

Lévy made many fundamental contributions to probability theory and the nascent theory of stochastic processes. 
He introduced the notion of &#x27;stable distribution&#x27; which share the property of stability under addition of independent variables and proved a general version of the Central Limit theorem, recorded in his 1937 book &quot;Théorie de l&#x27;addition des variables aléatoires&quot;, using the notion of characteristic function. He also introduced, independently from Aleksandr Khinchin, the notion of infinitely divisible law and derived their characterization through the Lévy–Khintchine representation.

His 1948 monograph on Brownian motion, &quot;Processus stochastiques et mouvement brownien&quot;, contains a wealth of new concepts and results, including the Lévy area, the Lévy arcsine law,
the local time of a Brownian path, and many other results.

Lévy received a number of honours, including membership at the French Academy of Sciences and honorary membership at the London Mathematical Society.

His daughter Marie-Hélène Schwartz and son-in-law Laurent Schwartz were also notable mathematicians.

<doc id="556467" wikidata="Q2390844" url="?curid=556467" title="War tax stamp">
<text>A war tax stamp is a type of postage stamp added to an envelope in addition to regular postage. It is similar to a postal tax stamp, but the revenue is used to defray the costs of a war; as with other postal taxes, its use is obligatory for some period of time.

== Early Spanish issues ==
The first war tax stamps were produced in 1874 in Spain, during the Third Carlist War. A decree of October 2, 1873, imposed a war tax on letters and stamped documents. The stamps were issued on January 1, 1874, in two denominations, 5 centimos and 10 centimos, and depicted the Spanish coat of arms along with the inscription &quot;Impuesto de Guerra&quot; or &quot;Impto de Guerra&quot;. The 5 centimo value was intended for use on letters, and the 10 centimo for use on stamped documents. A similar set, using different colors, was issued on January 1, 1875. On June 1, 1876, after the Third Carlist War had ended, a further set of five depicting King Alfonso XII was issued. Intended to help pay off war debts, this set bore denominations of 5, 10 and 25 centimos, 1 peseta and 5 pesetas. On September 1, 1877, additional denominations of 15 and 50 centimos were added to this set. A new issue, also bearing King Alfonso&#x27;s likeness, was prepared and printed for use in 1879. This issue, a set of seven with denominations of 5, 10, 15, 25 and 50 centimos and 1 and 5 pesetas, was never placed in use as a decree of February 4, 1879 lifted the war tax.

Spain also issued war tax stamps in 1897 and 1898, during the Cuban War of Independence and Spanish–American War. The first set, issued in 1897, contained four stamps bearing the numbers 5, 10, 15 and 20, reflecting their denomination in centimos. The war tax was not initially applied to letters, but apparently was extended to them before the end of 1897. Again, the 5 centimo value was used on letters. Like the earlier issues, they were inscribed &quot;Impto de Guerra&quot;; additionally, they were inscribed &quot;1897–98&quot;. For the second set, issued in 1898, the inscription was changed to &quot;1898–99&quot;. A single stamp was issued in 1898, a 5 centimo value bearing the likeness of King Alfonso XIII.

== World War I ==
The majority of war tax stamps were produced during and immediately after World War I, primarily within the British Empire and its dominions. In most cases, they were produced by overprinting regular issues with &quot;WAR TAX&quot; or &quot;WAR STAMP&quot;, though the overprint &quot;WAR&quot; was occasionally used (as in the issues of British Honduras). While they were meant to pay for the war tax only, they were often applied toward postage and registration fees. The following British colonies and dominions produced war tax stamps: Antigua, Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, British Guiana, British Honduras, Canada, Cayman Islands, Ceylon, Dominica, Falkland Islands, Fiji, Gibraltar, Gilbert and Ellice Islands, Gold Coast, Grenada, Jamaica, Malta, Montserrat, New Zealand, St. Helena, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands and Virgin Islands. 

Canada was the first country to issue such stamps during this period, following passage of its Special War Revenue Act in February 1915. Its first war tax stamps, produced by modifying the dies of its King George V stamps to read &quot;WAR TAX&quot;, were released in March 1915, in denominations of 1 and 2 cents. There are also denominations in 4 and 8 cents. One bank-note from the 1920s is known to have both the 4 and 8 cent, original style, war-tax stamps. The design was modified again in 1916, applying the inscription &quot;1T¢&quot; to 2 cent stamps. This indicated that the stamps carried both their face value and the tax of 1 cent, conceptually similar to a semi-postal stamp, but whose use was required rather than optional. New Zealand followed Canada&#x27;s example in September 1915, becoming the second country to issue war tax stamps.

Great Britain and Australia imposed war taxes on mail, but did not issue war tax stamps; instead, they used regular stamps to pay the fees. In the United States, which also imposed a war tax following its entry into the war in 1917, the rate for a first-class letter was raised from 2 cents to 3 cents; the added cent was used to pay the tax. A special stamp depicting the allegorical figure of Victory and flags of the Allies was issued to pay this rate.

After Portugal entered World War I in March 1916, several of its colonies issued war tax stamps as well. Most of these were produced by overprinting &quot;TAXA DE GUERRA&quot; on existing stamps, though Mozambique issued a set of two which depicted allegorical figures of History and the Republic. The Portuguese colonies of Macao, Mozambique, Portuguese Africa, Portuguese Guinea, Portuguese India and Timor issued war tax stamps.

== Other war tax issues ==
Though many countries (e.g., Australia) imposed taxes on mail during World War II, regular stamps were used to pay those taxes. One exception was North Borneo, which issued two war tax stamps in February 1941. These were produced by overprinting &quot;WAR TAX&quot; on the 1 and 2 cent values of a 1939 set of regular stamps.

War tax stamps were issued by Bahrain in 1973 and 1974, with a denomination of 5 fils.

<doc id="556470" wikidata="Q2700066" url="?curid=556470" title="USS Wichita (CA-45)">
<text>USS &quot;Wichita&quot; was a unique heavy cruiser of the United States Navy built in the 1930s. The last American cruiser designed to meet the limits of the London Naval Treaty, she was originally intended to be a heavy cruiser, accordingly with the maximum main armament of three triple gun turrets. These were instead placed on an improved hull derived from the &quot;Brooklyn&quot;-class light cruisers, with increased armor. This design would go on to form the basis for the later World War II–era heavy cruisers such as the . The ship was authorized by the 1929 Cruiser Act, laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in October 1935, launched in November 1937, and commissioned into the US Navy in February 1939.

Following her commissioning, &quot;Wichita&quot; was assigned to neutrality patrols in the Atlantic. After the United States entered World War II, the ship saw heavy service throughout the conflict. She was first assigned to convoy escort duty on the Murmansk Run in early 1942, and supported amphibious landings during Operation Torch in November 1942. During the Naval Battle of Casablanca, &quot;Wichita&quot; engaged several French coastal batteries and warships, including the battleship . In 1943, &quot;Wichita&quot; was transferred to the Pacific Theater, where she remained for the rest of the war. She frequently provided antiaircraft defense for the Fast Carrier Task Force during operations in the central Pacific, including the Battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in 1944. During the latter engagement, &quot;Wichita&quot; assisted in the sinking of the Japanese aircraft carrier .

&quot;Wichita&quot; was heavily engaged during the invasion of Okinawa, where she provided heavy gunfire support to ground troops ashore. After the Japanese surrender, the ship served as part of the occupation force in Japan and assisted in the repatriation of American military personnel under Operation Magic Carpet. After returning to the United States, she was decommissioned and placed in the &quot;mothball&quot; fleet in 1947. She remained in reserve until 1959, when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold for scrapping in August 1959.

==Design==
In the early 1930s, the Secretary of the Navy, Curtis D. Wilbur, pushed for a new construction program for light and heavy cruisers. Wilbur succeeded in passing the Cruiser Act in 1929, which authorized several new cruisers. Five heavy cruisers, the last of which was &quot;Wichita&quot;, were ordered between 1931 and 1934. &quot;Wichita&quot; was the last heavy cruiser permitted under the terms of the London Naval Treaty in 1930, which limited the US to 18 heavy cruisers with a maximum standard displacement of . The ship was originally intended to be built to the design of the , but the design was reworked before construction began. Instead, the design for &quot;Wichita&quot; was based on the of light cruisers. The &quot;Brooklyn&quot; design was modified heavily, to give the new ship higher freeboard and better stability, and an increased cruising radius. The secondary battery of eight guns was identical in number to the light cruisers, but was arranged to give better fields of fire. The main battery of nine guns was mounted in a new gun turret design that rectified problems discovered in earlier cruisers.

&quot;Wichita&quot; was laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 28 October 1935, and launched on 16 November 1937. By the time she was completed, in February 1938, &quot;Wichita&quot; was nearly over the 10,000-ton limit; as a result, she was completed with only six of the eight 5-inch guns to keep her under the displacement restriction. When the rest of the 5-inch guns were installed, it was found that the ship was too top-heavy, and so of pig iron had to be added to her bottom to balance the cruiser. &quot;Wichita&quot; was commissioned into the US Navy on 16 February 1939 and was assigned the hull number CA-45. Her first commander was Captain Thaddeus A. Thomson.

===General characteristics===
&quot;Wichita&quot; was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced at standard displacement and at full combat load. The ship had a crew of 929 officers and enlisted men. She was equipped with four seaplanes and a pair of aircraft catapults and a crane for handling the aircraft which were mounted on the stern. &quot;Wichita&quot; was powered by four Parsons steam turbines and eight Babcock &amp; Wilcox oil-fired water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated at and a top speed of . She carried of fuel oil, which gave her a maximum cruising range of at .

The hull was protected by a waterline armored belt composed of Class A armor that was thick amidships. It was reduced to thick on either end. The belt was backed with of special treatment steel. The Class A steel was significantly more effective than the Class B armor used in earlier cruisers; 8-inch guns had to be within to penetrate the belt, as opposed to for the earlier armor. &quot;Wichita&quot; had a thick deck, which was immune to 8-inch fire inside . The conning tower had thick sides and a 2.25 in thick roof. The ship&#x27;s main battery turrets had thick faces, thick sides, thick rears, and thick roofs. The turrets were mounted on armored barbettes protected with of armor plating.

===Armament===
&quot;Wichita&quot; was armed with a main battery of nine 8-inch /55 Mark 12 guns mounted in three 3-gun turrets. The guns fired a projectiles at a muzzle velocity of . Maximum elevation of the guns was 41 degrees; this provided a maximum range of . Rate of fire was approximately one salvo every fifteen seconds. The turrets allowed each gun to elevate and fire individually. Her secondary battery consisted of eight 5-inch /38 Mark 12 dual-purpose guns, four in single, enclosed Mark 30 high-angle mounts, and four in open mounts. These guns fired projectiles at a rate of 20 rounds per minute. Muzzle velocity was ; against aerial targets, the guns had a ceiling of at 85 degrees. At 45 degrees, the guns could engage surface targets at a range of . &quot;Wichita&quot; was the first cruiser in the US Navy to be equipped with the new 5-inch /38 gun.

By August 1945, the ship had been equipped with numerous smaller guns for close-range anti-aircraft defense. Sixteen Bofors 40 mm guns were placed in quadruple mounts, and another eight were in dual mounts. She also carried eighteen Oerlikon 20 mm guns in single mountings. The 40 mm guns had a ceiling of at 90 degrees elevation and a maximum rate of fire of 160 rounds per minute. The 20 mm gun had a rate of fire of 465–480 rounds per minute; they had a ceiling of . By the end of the war, the ship was armed with a variety of fire control systems for her guns, including Mark 34 fire control gear and Mark 13 and Mark 28 fire control radars.

==Service history==

&quot;Wichita&quot; departed Philadelphia after her commissioning, bound for Houston, Texas. She arrived on 20 April 1939 and took part in the dedicatory and memorial service at the San Jacinto Battle Monument and War Relic Museum. The ship left Houston on 1 May for her shakedown cruise, during which she visited the Virgin Islands, Cuba, and the Bahamas before she returned to Philadelphia for post-shakedown repairs. On 25 September, a few weeks after the outbreak of World War II in Europe, &quot;Wichita&quot; was assigned to Cruiser Division 7 in the Atlantic Squadron, based in the Hampton Roads. She conducted her first neutrality patrol on 4–9 October. After returning to port, she went into dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard for maintenance, which lasted until 1 December. On 4 December, &quot;Wichita&quot; steamed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, arriving on the 8th. There, Thomson assumed command of the newly formed Caribbean Patrol, which included &quot;Wichita&quot; and the cruiser , and the destroyers , , , , and , and Navy patrol squadrons VP-33 and VP-51. Over the course of the next three months, the force conducted a series of training maneuvers in the Caribbean. At the end of February, &quot;Wichita&quot; returned to Norfolk via Philadelphia, where she participated in further training through May.

Starting in June, &quot;Wichita&quot; and conducted a goodwill cruise to South America; &quot;Wichita&quot; carried Rear Admiral Andrew C. Pickens, the commander of Cruiser Division 7. Included in the ports of call were Rio de Janeiro and Santos in Brazil, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Montevideo, Uruguay. The cruise ended in late September; the two cruisers arrived in Norfolk on the 24th. Over the next three months, &quot;Wichita&quot; served as a training ship for Naval Reserve midshipmen and conducted gunnery practices off the Virginia capes. On 7 January 1941, &quot;Wichita&quot; departed Hampton Roads for Guantanamo, arriving four days later. She participated in fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean through March and took part in practice amphibious landings at Puerto Rico. She returned to the United States, docking at the New York Navy Yard, on 23 March. &quot;Wichita&quot; went to sea again on 6 April, bound for Bermuda; she reached her destination two days later. She then joined the aircraft carrier and the heavy cruiser for a patrol in the North Atlantic, during which the ships sailed to within of Ireland.

&quot;Wichita&quot; then returned to the New York Navy Yard on 17 May and went into drydock on 21 June. Repairs were completed on 2 July, after which &quot;Wichita&quot; was transferred to Newport, Rhode Island. She sortied again on 27 July bound for Iceland as part of Task Force 16 under Operation Indigo II, the occupation of Iceland. &quot;Wichita&quot; arrived in Reykjavík on 6 August, along with the carrier and the battleship . The task force landed a contingent of US Army troops and fighter aircraft to provide air support. The cruiser returned to the United States by 20 August. &quot;Wichita&quot; returned to Iceland in September, arriving in Reykjavík on 28 September. Two days prior to &quot;Wichita&quot;″s arrival, the US Navy ordered the units of the Atlantic Fleet to protect all ships engaged in commerce in United States defensive waters. The orders authorized the Navy to patrol, escort merchantmen, and attack any German or Italian naval forces encountered. &quot;Wichita&quot; was assigned to Task Group 7.5, which was engaged in patrolling Icelandic waters through the end 1941. On 7 December 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, bringing the United States into World War II; on the day of the attack, &quot;Wichita&quot; lay at anchor at Hvalfjörður, Iceland.

===Atlantic theater===

&quot;Wichita&quot; left port on 5 January 1942 for training and a patrol in the Denmark Strait; she returned to Hvalfjörður on 10 January. On the 15th, a powerful storm, with sustained winds of and gusts up to , hit Iceland. &quot;Wichita&quot; was damaged by the storm, including a collision with the freighter and the British trawler . She then ran aground off Hrafneyri Light. The following day, the ship&#x27;s crew evaluated her condition; she had suffered minor damage from the collisions, including some leaks, and damage to the hull from the grounding. Temporary repairs were effected in Iceland to allow &quot;Wichita&quot; to return to the New York Navy Yard for more thorough repairs. She arrived on 9 February, and repairs lasted until 26 February, when she left port for training maneuvers off Maine in early March.

On 26 March, &quot;Wichita&quot;, assigned to Task Force 39, departed the United States to reinforce the British Home Fleet based in Scapa Flow. Task Force 39, commanded by Rear Admiral John W. Wilcox, Jr., included &quot;Wasp&quot;, the battleship , the cruiser &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, and eight destroyers. While en route, Wilcox was swept overboard in a heavy sea and lost. Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen, who flew his flag in &quot;Wichita&quot;, took command of the task force. After arriving in Scapa Flow, &quot;Wichita&quot; and the other American ships spent several weeks training with their British counterparts. On 28 April, &quot;Wichita&quot; departed on her first major operation with the British. She was assigned to the Allied escort for the Arctic convoys QP 11 and PQ 15. The American component, organized as Task Force 99, comprised &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Wichita&quot;, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, and four destroyers. The British assigned the carrier , the battleship , a light cruiser, and five destroyers. After successfully escorting the convoys, &quot;Wichita&quot; returned to Hvalfjörður, arriving on 6 May.

&quot;Wichita&quot; sortied on 12 May to relieve &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, which was patrolling the Denmark Strait. &quot;Wichita&quot; returned to Hvalfjörður a week later, before putting to sea as part of another Allied convoy escort protecting one leg of the movement of Murmansk-bound convoy PQ 16 and eastbound QP 12. She put into Scapa Flow on 29 May after completing the mission. While in Scapa Flow, King George VI inspected &quot;Wichita&quot; on 7 June. &quot;Wichita&quot; left Scapa Flow on 12 June, bound for Hvalfjörður, and arrived 14 June. She then relieved the British cruiser on patrol in the Denmark Strait. While on patrol on 17 June, &quot;Wichita&quot; spotted a German Focke-Wulf Fw 200 reconnaissance bomber and opened fire, though without result. Three days later, she engaged another Fw 200, again without success.

After returning to Hvalfjörður, &quot;Wichita&quot; steamed to Seidisfjord at the end of June, where she joined &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and three destroyers. They were assigned to the escort for the convoy PQ 17. The convoy escort also included &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Victorious&quot;, and the battleship . The Germans organized a powerful task force, centered on the battleship and three heavy cruisers, to attack the convoy; the operation was codenamed &quot;Rösselsprung&quot; (Knight&#x27;s Move). Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British Admiralty, which ordered the convoy to disperse. Aware that they had been detected, the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to U-boats and the Luftwaffe. The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts, and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports. The next day, while south of Spitzbergen, the ships were spotted and shadowed by a pair of Fw 200s. Both &quot;Wichita&quot; and &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; opened fire with their antiaircraft guns, but the Fw 200s escaped without damage.

In late July, &quot;Wichita&quot; went into drydock at the Royal Navy base in Rosyth, Scotland. Repairs, which included correcting a propeller shaft vibration, lasted from 24 July until 9 August. The repairs to the propeller shaft were ineffective, however, which necessitated a return to the United States. She reached the New York Navy Yard on 22 August for repairs, which lasted until 5 September. She completed a round of post-repair sea trials before conducting gunnery exercises in the Chesapeake Bay. &quot;Wichita&quot; conducted training off the Virginia Capes for the rest of the month, after which she steamed to Casco Bay in Maine for further maneuvers.

====Operation Torch====
At the end of October, &quot;Wichita&quot; was assigned to Task Group 34.1, under the command of Rear Admiral H. Kent Hewitt, who flew his flag in . The Task Group also included the battleship and &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;. The ships were assigned to provide gunfire support for Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa. &quot;Wichita&quot; participated in the Naval Battle of Casablanca, which began early on the morning of 8 November. The ships were tasked with neutralizing the primary French defenses, which included coastal guns on El Hank, several submarines, and the incomplete battleship which lay at anchor in the harbor. &quot;Wichita&quot; and &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; initially engaged the French batteries on El Hank and the French submarine pens, while &quot;Massachusetts&quot; attacked &quot;Jean Bart&quot;. French naval forces, led by the cruiser , put up a stubborn defense.

In response, the French launched a pair of attacks to break up the American landings. During the first French attack, either &quot;Wichita&quot; or &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; damaged the French destroyer and forced it aground. A second French attack was also defeated; one of the two cruisers sank the destroyer and damaged . &quot;Wichita&quot;, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, and &quot;Massachusetts&quot; also engaged &quot;Jean Bart&quot;. At 11:28, &quot;Wichita&quot; was hit by a shell, fired by a gun on El Hank. The shell penetrated her deck and exploded below, injuring fourteen men. Hewitt broke off the attack temporarily, but by 13:12, several American warships began firing on French vessels exiting the harbor. &quot;Wichita&quot; and &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; closed on the port to engage the cruisers &quot;Primauguet&quot; and , still in the harbor. Heavy fire from El Hank forced the American cruisers to retreat shortly after 15:00. For the remainder of the operations off North Africa, &quot;Wichita&quot; patrolled between Casablanca and Fedhala. Her part in the amphibious assault complete, &quot;Wichita&quot; departed the area on 12 November, bound for New York for repairs; she arrived on 19 November.

===Pacific theater===
Shortly after repairs were completed, &quot;Wichita&quot; was transferred to the Pacific theater. She was assigned to Task Force 18, commanded by Rear Admiral Giffen, and tasked with operations off Guadalcanal. She was joined by the heavy cruisers and , the light cruisers , , and . In addition, the escort carriers and , and eight destroyers were present in the task group. On the night of 29 January 1943, the Task Force was steaming off Rennell Island; wary of the threat from Japanese submarines, which Allied intelligence indicated were likely in the area, Giffen arranged his cruisers and destroyers for anti-submarine defense, not expecting an air attack. The cruisers were aligned in two columns, spaced apart. &quot;Wichita&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, and &quot;Louisville&quot;, in that order, were to starboard, and &quot;Montpelier&quot;, &quot;Cleveland&quot;, and &quot;Columbia&quot; were to port. The six destroyers were in a semicircle ahead of the cruiser columns. That evening, the ships came under attack from Japanese torpedo bombers. In the ensuing Battle of Rennell Island, &quot;Chicago&quot; was hit by several torpedoes and sunk; &quot;Wichita&quot; was hit by one torpedo, though it failed to explode.

&quot;Wichita&quot; then steamed to Efate in the New Hebrides for a training period. She then departed on 7 April, bound for Pearl Harbor and arriving there a week later. On 18 April, she steamed out of Pearl Harbor for Adak, Alaska, again flying Giffen&#x27;s flag, for Task Group 52.10. In early May, &quot;Wichita&quot; was assigned to the amphibious force tasked with liberating the Aleutian Islands from Japanese control. She served as the flagship of the northern covering force, along with the cruisers &quot;Louisville&quot; and and four destroyers. On 6 July, &quot;Wichita&quot;, three other cruisers, and four destroyers bombarded Japanese positions on the island of Kiska. The bombardment convinced the Japanese that the Americans intended to invade the island in the near future; they therefore planned an evacuation by July.
On 19 July, a powerful American fleet, including the battleships , , and &quot;Mississippi&quot; joined &quot;Wichita&quot; to conduct another attack on Kiska three days later. Five days later, malfunctioning radar equipment led to a battle with radar phantoms (the &quot;Battle of the Pips&quot;); &quot;Wichita&quot;, two battleships, and two other cruisers expended over a thousand rounds of ammunition from their main batteries on the empty sea. That same day, the Japanese successfully evacuated the island, which was invaded by American troops two weeks later. The morning after the assumed engagement, &quot;Wichita&quot; launched a seaplane to reconnoiter the area, but found no evidence of Japanese forces.

&quot;Wichita&quot; participated in exercises off Hawaii for the remainder of the year. On 16 January 1944, she departed to take part in the invasion of the Marshall Islands. She was assigned to Task Group 58.3, under the command of Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. The Task Group included the fleet carrier , the light carriers and , the fast battleships , &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, , and , and several destroyers. &quot;Wichita&quot; provided anti-aircraft support for the carriers while they conducted air strikes on Kwajalein and Eniwetok on 29–31 January. On 4 February, &quot;Wichita&quot; arrived at Majuro; she was transferred to Task Group 58.2. The force departed Majuro on 12 February and conducted Operation Hailstone, a major air strike on the Japanese base at Truk, four days later.

On the night of 16 February, Japanese aircraft launched an attack on the Task Group and torpedoed the carrier . Task Unit 58.2.4, which included &quot;Wichita&quot;, was detached to escort &quot;Intrepid&quot; back to safety and repairs. The ships reached Majuro on 20 February, and departed for Hawaii eight days later. The ships arrived in port on 4 March, and on the 9th, &quot;Wichita&quot; became the flagship of Cruiser Division 6. On 15 March, Cruiser Division 6 departed Hawaii to return to Majuro, arriving on 20 March. After arriving, she joined the screen for the Fast Carrier Task Force, which struck Japanese bases on Yap, Woleai, and in the Palaus. &quot;Wichita&quot; supported strikes on Hollandia in New Guinea on 13–22 April. The task force returned to the seas off Truk on 29 April for a second round of airstrikes on the port. While the carriers were striking Truk, &quot;Wichita&quot; and several cruisers and destroyers shelled Japanese targets on Satawan Island in the Nomol group of the Caroline Islands.
On 4 May, &quot;Wichita&quot; returned to Majuro for a month of training. In June, she returned to the fleet, which was gathering at Kwajalein in preparations for operations against the Mariana Islands. &quot;Wichita&quot; was assigned to Task Unit 53.10.8, which shelled Saipan on 13 June. The next day, &quot;Wichita&quot; bombarded Japanese gun positions on Guam, before returning to Saipan later that day. On 17 June, she joined Task Group 58.7; the force patrolled to the west of the Marianas over the next three days in an attempt to intercept the large Japanese carrier force known to be approaching. On 19 June, the Japanese carriers struck at the American fleet, starting the Battle of the Philippine Sea. &quot;Wichita&quot; contributed to the antiaircraft screen; her gunners claimed to have assisted in the destruction of two Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers. The ship was detached to cover troop transports and escort carriers off Saipan on 25 June. This duty lasted through the first week of July. Now part of Task Unit 53.18.1, &quot;Wichita&quot; bombarded Japanese positions on Guam on 8–12 July, and again starting on 18 July.

&quot;Wichita&quot; departed Guam on 10 August, bound for Eniwetok. She arrived three days later and remained there until 29 August, when she put to sea to join Task Group 38.1. She screened for the fast carrier task group while they launched airstrikes on Japanese targets in Palau, the Carolines, the Philippines, and Dutch East Indies. On 28 August, TG 38.1 raided targets in Palau and Morotai. By mid-September, TG 38.1 provided air support for the assault on Morotai; the operation lasted until 21 September. The following day, the carriers launched an airstrike on Manila in the Philippines. Early on 22 September, Japanese aircraft launched a counterattack. At 07:34, &quot;Wichita&quot; shot down a bomber approximately 50 yards from her. She shot down another bomber at 07:45. She continued to provide antiaircraft defense for the carriers while they struck Japanese installations on Cebu, Negros, and Coron.

====Operations off the Philippines====
&quot;Wichita&quot; got underway to support a raid on Okinawa on 2 October. On 10 October, the fleet reached the waters off Okinawa and launched the strike. The following day, the fleet struck Aparri on Luzon. The fleet then raided Formosa, where they targeted Japanese airfields to prepare for the upcoming assault against the Philippines. On 13 October, Japanese bombers attacked the fleet and badly damaged the cruiser . &quot;Wichita&quot; took &quot;Canberra&quot; under tow, though she was relieved by the ocean-going tug on 15 October. &quot;Wichita&quot; joined the screen for &quot;Canberra&quot;; the squadron was joined by the badly damaged cruiser . The ships were attacked again the following day, and &quot;Houston&quot; was torpedoed again. &quot;Wichita&quot; left the damaged ships on 21 October, after they had successfully reached safer waters. &quot;Wichita&quot; then rejoined the fleet off Luzon, assigned to Task Force 34 under Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee.

&quot;Wichita&quot; was present during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, which started on 23 October. On 25 October, the Fast Carrier Strike Force had steamed north, to attack the Northern Force commanded by Jisaburō Ozawa. &quot;Wichita&quot; again screened for the carriers, which sank or damaged several Japanese carriers. Task Force 34 was detached to finish off several of the crippled Japanese ships with gunfire; &quot;Wichita&quot; and three other cruisers sank the light carrier and the destroyer . &quot;Wichita&quot; expended twenty-two percent of her armor-piercing rounds at the two ships, which amounted to 148 rounds at &quot;Chiyoda&quot; and 173 against &quot;Hatsuzuki&quot;. In the aftermath of the battle, &quot;Wichita&quot; returned to screening for the carriers off Samar. On 28 October, she provided gunfire support to troops ashore on Leyte. Two days later, she defended against a Japanese airstrike on the fleet.

On 31 October, &quot;Wichita&quot; left the area, bound for Ulithi, reaching her destination on 2 November. After replenishing her ammunition and stores, she returned to Leyte for several days, until the middle of November. Her crew detected severe vibrations in her No. 4 engine; the propeller shaft had broken and the propeller was trailing. She was therefore detached on 18 November for repairs in California, via Ulithi. While in Ulithi, divers discovered cracks in a strut for No. 3 propeller shaft; now only two screws were operational. She reached San Pedro in California on 15 December. She entered the Terminal Island Navy Yard shortly after reaching port. Repairs lasted until 8 February 1945, and by 28 February, she departed for Pearl Harbor. &quot;Wichita&quot; arrived in Hawaii on 6 March, before departing five days later for Ulithi.

====Invasion of Okinawa====
&quot;Wichita&quot; arrived in Ulithi on 20 March, and was assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54) the next day. She put to sea to take part in the invasion of Okinawa. The ship was placed in Task Unit 54.2.3 to cover minesweepers off Okinawa on 25 March. On the afternoon of the following day, &quot;Wichita&quot; bombarded Japanese positions on the island, from 13:50 to 16:30. Japanese aircraft attacked the ships early the next morning; &quot;Wichita&quot;″s gunners shot down one of the aircraft. Later that day, the ship resumed bombardment duties in preparation for the amphibious invasion. She continued to shell the island through 28 March. The next day, she retired to Kerama Retto to replenish her ammunition. The ship then returned to Okinawa later that day to cover underwater demolition teams as they cleared beach obstacles. &quot;Wichita&quot; continued to support the demolition teams the next day, as well as shelling targets ashore. On 31 March, &quot;Wichita&quot; bombarded the sea wall to create a breach in preparation for the landings.

The invasion began on 1 April, and &quot;Wichita&quot; provided gunfire support to the landing troops on the southern beaches. At around 12:00, she left the firing line to replenish her ammunition. She resumed bombardment the following day and resupplied again on 3 April before covering minesweepers on 4 April. During the night of 4–5 April, &quot;Wichita&quot; shelled the Japanese defenders on Okinawa. The ship was assigned to join Task Group 51.19 the next day to bombard Tsugen Shima in company with &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; and the battleships and . Japanese aircraft appeared, which forced the cancellation of the mission. Nevertheless, &quot;Wichita&quot; shelled Japanese shore batteries at Chiyama Shima that evening.

Late on 6 April, an A6M Zero attempted to attack &quot;Wichita&quot;. The fighter came down through a break in the clouds on &quot;Wichita&quot;″s port side. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft gunners immediately opened fire; a burst from one of the 20 mm guns shot away the Zero&#x27;s tail. The plane veered away, out of control, and dropped its bomb, which fell approximately from the ship. The Zero&#x27;s wing clipped the deck before the plane crashed into the sea. Eleven men were wounded in the attack, though the ship remained undamaged. The following day, &quot;Wichita&quot; steamed into Nakagusuku Bay to shell a coastal battery. Shells from the Japanese guns landed close to the ship, but no hits were scored before &quot;Wichita&quot; neutralized the battery. Over the next two days, the ship continued to bombard Japanese defenses on the island, until she retired to replenish ammunition on 10 April.

&quot;Wichita&quot; continued to provide gunfire support throughout the rest of the month. On 27 April, a small caliber shell penetrated a fuel oil tank five feet below the waterline. After temporary repairs while still off Okinawa proved unsuccessful, &quot;Wichita&quot; returned to Kerama Retto where the damage was repaired on 29–30 April. &quot;Wichita&quot; then returned to the gun line. On 12 May, the ship was damaged by friendly fire. A 5-inch round struck the port aircraft catapult; shell fragments hit the shield of an antiaircraft director, killing one man and injuring eleven others. She departed the area to rest and refit at Leyte, returning to Okinawa on 18 June. &quot;Wichita&quot; continued to provide gunfire support to the troops on Okinawa through July, as part of Task Unit 2. On 15 August, the ship&#x27;s crew received word that the war with Japan was over. &quot;Wichita&quot; was awarded 13 battle stars for her service during World War II.

===Post-war===

&quot;Wichita&quot; was assigned to the occupying force shortly after the end of the war. She departed Okinawa on 10 September for Nagasaki, arriving the following day as part of Task Group 55.7. &quot;Wichita&quot; was one of the first major warships to reach Japan; she was escorted by a destroyer, a pair of destroyer escorts, two minesweepers, and the hospital ship . &quot;Wichita&quot; was transferred to Sasebo on 25 September for four days before she returned to Nagasaki on 29 September. She returned to Sasebo shortly thereafter, and while she was there, a severe typhoon struck the area on 9–11 October. &quot;Wichita&quot; was not damaged during the storms. While at Sasebo, &quot;Wichita&quot;″s crew inspected the Japanese ships and harbor installations to ensure Japanese compliance with the terms of surrender.

On 5 November, &quot;Wichita&quot; was assigned to Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation of American military personnel. She refueled in Tokyo before departing for San Francisco. The ship reached San Francisco on 24 November, where she went into drydock at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard two days later. Repairs and modifications for further Magic Carpet duty were completed by 1 December. &quot;Wichita&quot; departed for Hawaii on 6 December, reaching Pearl Harbor on 12 December before proceeding to the Marianas. There, the ship loaded servicemen from Saipan and steamed back to San Francisco, arriving on 12 January 1946. She left port on 27 January bound for the east coast of the United States; she transited the Panama Canal on 5–9 February and reached Philadelphia on 14 February. There, she was assigned to the Sixteenth Fleet and was placed in reserve on 15 July. &quot;Wichita&quot; was decommissioned on 3 February 1947 and laid up at Philadelphia.

In the late 1940s, the Navy considered converting &quot;Wichita&quot; into a guided-missile cruiser, but and &quot;Canberra&quot; were chosen instead. On 1 March 1959, the ship was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and sold on 14 August to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation.

<text>The Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (), abbreviated as MMK, is the foundational text of the Madhyamaka school of Mahāyāna Buddhist philosophy. It was composed by the Indian philosopher Nāgārjuna (around roughly 150 CE).

The MMK makes use of reductio arguments to show how &quot;all&quot; phenomena (&quot;dharmas&quot;) are empty of &quot;svabhava&quot; (which has been variously translated as essence, own-being, or inherent existence). The MMK is widely regarded as one of the most influential and widely studied texts in the history of Buddhist philosophy. The MMK had a major impact on the subsequent development of Buddhist thought, especially in Tibetan Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism.

==Background==

The MMK is the work of Nāgārjuna, an Indian Buddhist monk and philosopher writing in Sanskrit. Very little is known about this figure, including exactly where he lived (somewhere in the Indian subcontinent), exactly what time (some time around the 2nd or 3rd century CE), and how many texts he composed. As with many early Indian historical figures, the biographical information which does exist is mainly hagiographical and from later periods. Most scholars agree that Nāgārjuna was a Mahāyāna Buddhist who believed all things (&quot;dharmas&quot;) to be empty, or without an intrinsic existence and nature (&quot;svabhāva&quot;). Beyond that, little can be said about him with certainty.

During the second and third centuries, Mahāyāna ideas were held by a minority of Buddhists in India who lived within the communities of Nikāya Buddhism (i.e. non-Mahāyāna Buddhism). Although all the major Buddhist schools at the time held that the person was empty of any eternal self or soul, some of the Abhidharma schools conceived of &quot;dharmas&quot; (transient phenomena, impermanent events) as ultimately real entities (&quot;dravyata&quot;) that had essences or &quot;intrinsic natures&quot; (&quot;svabhāva&quot;). These intrinsic natures were seen as an independent part of a phenomenon, an inherent self-sufficiency that was not caused by something else. Abhidharma schools like the Vaibhasikas accepted this doctrine and did not see it as conflicting with the idea of dependent origination. 

In the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot;, Nāgārjuna sought to refute these essentialist ideas found in Buddhist traditions such as Vaibhasika and Pudgalavada, as well as in Brahmanical schools of thought like Nyaya who also defended an essence based metaphysics. As such, his philosophy is also often termed &quot;Niḥsvabhāvavāda&quot; (the no &quot;svabhāva&quot; doctrine).

Nāgārjuna&#x27;s main contention with &quot;svabhāva&quot; theories was that they contradicted the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of dependent origination (&quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot;). Furthermore, essence theories are not in agreement with the Mahāyāna sutras Nāgārjuna would have been familiar with. These sutras, particularly the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā sūtras,&quot; teach a kind of comprehensive illusionist ontology that sees all dharmas, even nirvana and Buddhahood, as being empty and like an illusion. This illusionism was not totally new, since similar ideas about emptiness can be found in the early Buddhist texts (see: &quot;Samyutta Nikaya&quot; 22:95, as well as &quot;Samyukta Āgama&quot; 335 and 297). However, the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; texts are unique in seeing all dharmas, including nirvana, as empty and like illusions. The MMK cites the &quot;Kaccānagotta Sutta,&quot; an early Buddhist text, from which it draws one of its major ideas regarding the middle way: the explanation of &quot;right-view&quot; as being a middle way between saying that &quot;everything exists&quot; (referring to the view of permanent existence: Pali: &quot;atthitā&quot;, Skt. &quot;astitva&quot;) and saying that &quot;everything does not exist&quot; (non-existence; Pali: &quot;n&#x27;atthitā,&quot; Skt &quot;nāstitva&quot;). This middle way is then defined as the 12 principles (&quot;dvādaśāṅga&quot;) of dependent origination.

Thus, Nāgārjuna&#x27;s main project was to develop the philosophical position of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching of dependent origination and not-self/emptiness as well as the ideas of the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā sūtras&quot; in a logical and systematic manner by refuting &quot;svabhāva&quot; theories and self theories.

==Content==
The text is a series of 450 verses (karikas) organized into 27 chapters. The verses are aphoristic, often enigmatic, and extremely short. The text&#x27;s arguments are presented in a highly compressed and concise form. This is because the text is a &quot;karika&quot;-style work. Such texts were meant to be memorized as an aid to learning by students. The text&#x27;s arguments would be filled out through the oral commentary of a master. As such, the &quot;karikas&quot; are like a verse outline of the major philosophical arguments of an oral tradition.

The text seems to be mainly addressed to a Buddhist audience, particularly those who followed Abhidharma doctrines which held that dharmas are ultimately real and have svabhava (an intrinsic nature). The MMK takes up numerous Buddhist Abhidharma categories and ideas and examines them to show that they are empty and cannot have intrinsic nature. The MMK presents various arguments, mostly reductio in style, such as showing that an idea leads to an infinite regress.

The text begins with the following dedication verse:I salute the Fully Enlightened One, the best of orators, who taught the doctrine of dependent origination, according to which there is neither cessation nor origination, neither annihilation nor the eternal, neither singularity nor plurality, neither the coming nor the going [of any dharma, for the purpose of nirvāṇa characterized by] the auspicious cessation of hypostatization.The dedication sets out the main goal of the MMK, to eliminate conceptual proliferation, reification and hypostatization (&quot;prapañca&quot;), which expresses itself in different philosophical concepts such as essentialism, eternalism and annihilationism.

The first chapter discusses causation. The main thesis to be defended is given in the first verse:Not from itself, not from another, not from both, nor without cause: Never in any way is there any existing thing that has arisen.To put it another way, the main thesis which Nāgārjuna will defend here is that phenomena (dharmas) do &quot;not&quot; come into being in any of the following four ways:

* By being self-caused, or due to the fact that the effect was already present in the cause (&quot;hetu&quot;). This view was called &quot;satkāryavāda&quot;.
* By being caused by something else (&quot;asatkāryavāda&quot;), the cause and the effect being distinct entities
* A combination of both of the above, i.e. the cause and the effect and both identical and different
* Acausality, phenomena originate without causes (&quot;ahetu&quot;)

The main view that MMK focuses on debating with is the second one, which is held by Buddhist Abhidharma theorists which put forth four main forms of conditionality: the primary cause (&quot;hetu-pratyaya&quot;), the objective support (&quot;ārambaṇa-pratyaya&quot;), the proximate condition (&quot;samanantara&quot;-&quot;pratyaya&quot;), and the dominant condition (&quot;adhipati-pratyaya&quot;). The MMK takes up each one in order to refute them, arguing that, for those who hold that cause and effect are distinct, the producing relation can only be a conceptual construction.

=== Chapter overview ===
The 27 chapters of the MMK are as follows:

# : Analysis of conditions
# : Analysis of going and not going
# : Analysis of the eye and the other sense-organs
# : Analysis of the skandhas (&quot;aggregates&quot;)
# : Analysis of the dhatūs (&quot;constituents&quot;)
# : Analysis of desire and the desirous
# : Analysis of the constructed
# : Analysis of action and actor
# : Analysis of the past
# : Analysis of fire and fuel
# : Analysis of initial and final limits
# : Analysis of suffering
# : Analysis of mental constructions
# : Analysis of admixture
# : Analysis of own-nature
# : Analysis of bondage and liberation
# : Analysis of action (&quot;karma&quot;) and its fruit
# : Analysis of the self (&quot;atman&quot;).
# : Analysis of time
# : Analysis of combination
# : Analysis of becoming and un-becoming
# : Analysis of the Tathāgata. 
# : Analysis of Error
# : Analysis of the Noble Truths
# : Analysis of 
# : Analysis of the twelve links (of dependent origination)
# : Analysis of views

The authenticity of the last two chapters is disputed, and they may have been later additions, not composed by Nāgārjuna. However, most ancient commentaries take them to be canonical.

Different scholars divide up the work into different main parts. According to Jay Garfield, the MMK can be divided into four main sections:

# Chapters 1 through 7, which focus on the fundamental theoretical constructs in Buddhist ontology, such as dependent origination, change and impermanence, perception, the five aggregates, the elements or properties of things, and the relation between substance and attribute. All of these are shown to be empty of own-nature or essence.
# Chapters 8 through 13 focus on the nature of the self and of subjective experience. 
# Chapters 14 through 21 are mainly concerned with the external world and the relation of the self to objects.
# Chapters 22 through 27 discuss phenomena associated with the ultimate truth, such as buddhahood, emptiness, and nirvana (it is argued that all of these are also empty), as well as the relation of the conventional truth to the ultimate phenomena.

== Commentaries ==
As a kārikā-style text, the &quot;Mūlamadhyamakakārikā&quot; presents only aphoristic, often enigmatic and extremely short verses, much like the sūtra works of the various Hindu philosophical schools. Since they served primarily as pedagogical or mnemonic aids for teachers, commentaries were required to make the meaning of this type of text more explicit to the uninitiated reader. 

According to the Indian author Avalokitavrata, eight commentaries were written on the MMK: Nagarjuna&#x27;s self-commentary, and those of Buddhapalita, Candrakirti, Devasharman, Gunashri, Gunamati, Sthiramati, and Bhavaviveka. Not all of these have survived in full or in the original. Devasharman and Gunamati&#x27;s commentaries only survive in fragments and nothing is known of Gunashri&#x27;s. 

The Indian commentary called the &quot;Akutobhayā&quot;, whose authorship is unknown, though is attributed to Nagarjuna in the tradition, is held by Ames to be the earliest commentary on the MMK. C.W. Huntington has suggested that this commentary may not have been considered a separate text, but instead may have been a set of notes which may go back to oral explanations of the root text by Nāgārjuna himself. 

The earliest known commentary on the MMK by another author is preserved within the first Chinese translation of the Kārikā, known as the &quot;Middle Treatise&quot; ( &quot;Zhong Lun&quot;), translated by Kumarajiva in 409. The author of this commentary is given as either &quot;Blue Eyes&quot; (; back translated as *Vimalākṣa) or *Piṅgala (). This is by far the best known commentary in the East Asian Mādhyamaka tradition, forming one of the three commentaries that make up the Sanlun (&quot;Three Treatise&quot;) school. An influential figure of the Sanlun school is Jízàng (549–623), who wrote a commentary on the Middle Treatise in Chinese, the &quot;Zhongguanlun shu&quot; ().

Other surviving and influential Indian commentaries on the MMK include Buddhapālita&#x27;s (c. 470–550) &quot;&quot;Madhyamakvr̩tti&quot; and Bhāviveka&#x27;s (c. 500–578) &quot;Prajñāpradīpa&quot;&quot; (&quot;Lamp of Wisdom&quot;). These two survive in Tibetan translation. 

The most influential commentary for Tibetan Buddhism is Candrakirti&#x27;s (c. 7th century) &quot;Prasannapadā&quot; (&quot;Clear Words)&quot;, which survives in Sanskrit and Tibetan translation. 

An MMK commentary by the Indian Yogacara philosopher Sthiramati also survives in Chinese translation. This is the &quot;Commentary on the Mahāyāna Madhyamaka&quot; (&quot;Dasheng zhongguan shilun&quot; 大乘中觀釋論) which comments on the text from a Yogacara point of view.

In Tibet, various influential Tibetan language commentaries were written on the MMK. An early and important commentary is &quot;Ornament of Reason&quot; by Mabja Jangchub Tsöndrü (12th century). In the Gelug school, the key and definitive commentary is Je Tsongkhapa&#x27;s (1357–1419) &quot;Ocean of Reasoning&quot;. Meanwhile, in the Nyingma school, the most important commentaries are by more recent figures, mainly Ju Mipham and Khenpo Shenga.

During the modern and contemporary periods, new commentaries have been written from different perspectives. David Kalupahana, a Sri Lankan scholar, wrote a commentary (Kalupahana 1986) which interprets the text from an early Buddhist perspective. Meanwhile, Jay Garfield has published an English translation and commentary (Garfield 1995) which, though influenced by Tibetan interpretations, also attempts to explain the text to Western philosophers. Gudo Nishijima wrote a commentary from a Soto Zen perspective, while Siderits and Katsura have published a translation and commentary (2013) which mainly follow the classical Sanskrit tradition.

== Modern scholarly interpretations ==
As noted by Ruegg, Western scholarship has given a broad variety of interpretations of Nagarjuna&#x27;s Madhyamaka thought in the MMK, including: &quot;nihilism, monism, irrationalism, misology, agnosticism, scepticism, criticism, dialectic, mysticism, acosmism, absolutism, relativism, nominalism, and linguistic analysis with therapeutic value&quot;.

Some of the main scholarly interpretations of Nagarjuna&#x27;s MMK include the following:

* The Kantian interpretation, exemplified by Theodore Stcherbatsky’s &quot;The Conception of Buddhist Nirvāna&quot; (1927). This Kantian interpretation saw Nagarjuna as dividing the world into a realm of appearance or phenomenon (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;) and a realm of absolute reality or noumenon (&quot;nirvāṇa&quot;). This is also seen in T. R. V. Murti&#x27;s 1955 &quot;&quot;The Central Philosophy of Buddhism&quot;.&quot;
* The Pyrrhonian skeptic interpretation. Some scholars, such as Thomas McEvilley, have either argued that Nagarjuna was influenced by Greek Pyrrhonism or see Nagarjuna&#x27;s Madhyamaka as similar to that of Pyrrhonist philosophers such as Sextus Empiricus.
* The analytic interpretation, exemplified by Richard Robinson&#x27;s 1957 article &quot;“Some Logical Aspects of Nāgārjuna’s System”&quot;, sought to explain Madhyamaka using analytic philosophy&#x27;s logical apparatus. , Richard P. Hayes meanwhile, using analytical logic, critiques Nagarjuna as irrational and as relying on &quot;fallacies and tricks&quot;.
* The Pragmatist interpretation, exemplified by David Kalupahana&#x27;s translation and commentary of the MMK.
* The Wittgensteinian interpretation, exemplified by Frederick Streng&#x27;s &quot;Emptiness&quot; and Chris Gudmunsen&#x27;s &quot;Wittgenstein and Buddhism&quot;, which stressed the similarities between Nāgārjuna and the later Wittgenstein&#x27;s linguistic philosophy.
* American philosopher Mark Siderits has defended a svātantrika position. 
* Garfield,
 Napper, Hopkins, have adopted Gelug prāsaṅgika influenced interpretation. Jay Garfield has defended the use of modern logic to interpret Nagarjuna&#x27;s MMK.
* C.W. Huntington criticizes the reading of Nagarjuna through the use of modern analytical logic, since he sees Nagarjuna as &quot;distrustful of logic&quot;. He puts forth a more literary interpretation that focuses on the &quot;effect&quot; Nagarjuna was attempting to &quot;conjure&quot; on his readers (i.e. an experience of having no views). 
* Jan Westerhoff, argues that Nagarjuna&#x27;s thought is a kind of anti-foundationalism, &quot;which does not just deny the objective, intrinsic, and mind-independent existence of some class of objects, but rejects such existence for any kinds of objects that we could regard as the most fundamental building-blocks of the world.&quot;

: तस्माद् अस्तित्वनास्तित्वे नाश्रीयेत विचक्षणः।
:: Therefore a wise person does not say &quot;exists&quot; or &quot;does not exist&quot;.

===16:10===
: न निर्वाणसमारोपो न संसारापकषणम्
: यत्र कस्तत्र संसारो निर्वाणं किं विकल्प्यते
:: Where there is neither an addition of nirvana nor a removal of samsara; There, what samsara is discriminated from what nirvana?

: ātmetya api prajñapitam anātmetyapi deśitam
:: Although (the term) &quot;self&quot; is caused to be known (of, about), and although (a doctrine or teaching of) &quot;no self&quot; is taught,
: | 6
:: No &quot;self&quot; or any &quot;nonself&quot; whatsoever has been taught by the Buddhas.
:: The designable is ceased when/where the range of thought is ceased,
: | 7
:: Nirvana is like phenomenality, unarisen and unstopping.

:: The gnosis (knowledge, etc.) of the independently enlightened Buddhas proceeds without association (with teachings).

===22:11===
: &quot;Empty&quot; should not be asserted.&quot;Nonempty&quot; should not be asserted.

: तथागतो यत्स्वभावस्तत्स्वभावमिदं जगत्
: tathāgato yat svabhāvas tat svabhāvam idam jagat

===24:18, 24:19===
:Whatever is dependently co-arisen / That is explained to be emptiness.
:That, being a dependent designation, / Is itself the middle way.

:Something that is not dependently arisen / Such a thing does not exist.
:Therefore a non-empty thing / Does not exist.

===25:19–20===
: न संसारस्य निर्वाणात् किं चिद् अस्ति विशेषणं
:: There is nothing whatsoever of samsara distinguishing (it) from nirvana.
: न निर्वाणस्य संसारात् किं चिद् अस्ति विशेषणं। १९
: | 19
:: There is nothing whatsoever of nirvana distinguishing it from samsara.
: निर्वाणस्य च या कोटिः।कोटिः। संसरणस्य च

:: What is impermanent and permanent? What is neither?
:: Auspicious is the pacification of phenomenal metastasis, the pacification of all apprehending;
:: There is no dharma whatsoever taught by the Buddha to whomever whenever, wherever.

<text>The Anglican Church of Australia, originally known as the Church of England in Australia and Tasmania, is a Christian church in Australia and an autonomous church of the worldwide Anglican Communion. According to the 2021 Census, 2.5 million Australians (9.8% of the population) identified as Anglicans. It is the second largest church in Australia after the Roman Catholic Church.

For much of Australian history since the arrival of the First Fleet in January 1788, the church was the largest religious denomination. In recent times, however, Anglicanism in Australia has mirrored the steep decline in church membership and attendance experienced in many first-world nations. 

The church is one of the largest providers of social welfare services in Australia.

==History==
When the First Fleet was sent to New South Wales in 1787, Richard Johnson of the Church of England was licensed as chaplain to the fleet and the settlement. In 1825 Thomas Scott was appointed Archdeacon of Australia under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Calcutta, Reginald Heber. William Grant Broughton, who succeeded Scott in 1829, was consecrated the first (and only) &quot;Bishop of Australia&quot; in 1836. 

In early Colonial times, the Church of England clergy worked closely with the governors. Richard Johnson, a chaplain, was charged by the governor, Arthur Phillip, with improving &quot;public morality&quot; in the colony, but he was also heavily involved in health and education. Samuel Marsden (1765–1838) had magisterial duties, and so was equated with the authorities by the convicts. He became known as the &quot;flogging parson&quot; for the severity of his punishments. Some of the Irish convicts had been transported to Australia for political crimes or social rebellion in Ireland, so the authorities were suspicious of Roman Catholicism for the first three decades of settlement and Roman Catholic convicts were compelled to attend Church of England services and their children and orphans were raised by the authorities as Anglicans.

The Church of England lost its legal privileges in the Colony of New South Wales by the &quot;Church Act of 1836&quot;. Drafted by the reformist attorney-general John Plunkett, the act established legal equality for Anglicans, Roman Catholics and Presbyterians and was later extended to Methodists.

The Church Missionary Society established a mission to Aboriginal people in 1832 in the Wellington Valley, New South Wales, but it ended in failure: indigenous people in the 19th century demonstrated a reluctance to convert to the religion of the colonists who were seizing their lands.

In 1842 the Diocese of Tasmania was created. In 1847 the rest of the Diocese of Australia was divided into the four separate dioceses of Sydney, Adelaide, Newcastle and Melbourne. Over the following 80 years the number of dioceses increased to 25.

Sectarianism in Australia tended to reflect the political inheritance of Britain and Ireland. Until 1945, the vast majority of Roman Catholics in Australia were of Irish descent, causing the Anglo-Protestant majority to question their loyalty to the British Empire. The Australian Constitution of 1901 provided for freedom of religion. Australian society was predominantly Anglo-Celtic, with 40% of the population being Anglican.

In the early years of the 20th century the Church of England transformed itself in its patterns of worship, in the internal appearances of its churches, and in the forms of piety recommended by its clergy. The changes represented a heightened emphasis on the sacraments and were introduced by younger clergy trained in England and inspired by the Oxford and Anglo-Catholic movements. The church&#x27;s women and its upper and middle class parishes were most supportive, overcoming the reluctance of some of the men. The changes were widely adopted by the 1920s, making the Church of England more self-consciously &quot;Anglican&quot; and distinct from other Protestant churches. Controversy erupted, especially in New South Wales, between the politically liberal proponents of the Social Gospel, who wanted more Church attention to the social ills of society, and conservative elements. The opposition of the strong conservative evangelical forces within the Sydney diocese limited the liberals during the 1930s, but their ideas contributed to the formation of the influential post-World War II Christian Social Order Movement.

It remained the largest Christian denomination until the 1986 census. After World War II, the ethnic and cultural mix of Australia diversified and Anglicanism gave way to Roman Catholicism as the largest denomination. The number of Anglicans attending regular worship began to decline in 1959 and figures for occasional services (baptisms, confirmations, weddings and funerals) started to decline after 1966. In recent times, the Anglican and other Christian churches of Australia have been active in ecumenical activity. The Australian Committee for the World Council of Churches was established in 1946 by the Anglican and mainline Protestant churches. The movement evolved and expanded with Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches later joining and by 1994 the Roman Catholic Church was also a member of the national ecumenical body, the National Council of Churches in Australia.

Since 1 January 1962 the Australian church has been autocephalous and headed by its own primate. On 24 August 1981 the church officially changed its name from the Church of England in Australia and Tasmania to the Anglican Church of Australia.

Although the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; remains the official standard for Anglican belief and worship in Australia, &quot;An Australian Prayer Book&quot; (AAPB) was published in 1978 after a prolonged revision of liturgy. Another alternative service book, &quot;A Prayer Book for Australia&quot; (APBA), was published in 1995.

In 1985 the general synod of the Australian church passed a canon to allow the ordination of women as deacons. In 1992 the general synod approved legislation allowing dioceses to ordain women to the priesthood. Dioceses could choose to adopt the legislation. In 1992, 90 women were ordained in the Anglican Church of Australia and three others who had been ordained overseas were recognised. After decades of debate women&#x27;s ordination is rejected in a minority of dioceses. As of November 2024 only two (Sydney and North-West Australia) of the 23 dioceses have never ordained women as priests. A third diocese (Armidale) has ordained two women as priests but limited their service to the Anglican girls school and does not ordain women as priests for its churches. In 2008, Kay Goldsworthy was ordained as an assistant bishop for the Diocese of Perth, thus becoming the first woman consecrated as a bishop of the Anglican Church of Australia. Sarah Macneil was elected in 2013 to be the first female diocesan bishop in Australia. In 2014 she was consecrated and installed as the first female diocesan bishop in Australia (for the Diocese of Grafton in New South Wales).

The church remains a major provider of education and welfare services in Australia. It provides chaplains to the Australian Defence Force, hospitals, schools, industry and prisons. Senior clergy such as Peter Jensen, former Archbishop of Sydney, have a high profile in discussions on a diverse range of social issues in contemporary national debates. In recent times the church has encouraged its leaders to talk on such issues as indigenous rights; international security; peace and justice; and poverty and equity. The current primate is Geoffrey Smith, Archbishop of Adelaide, who commenced in the role on 7 April 2020 after Philip Freier stepped down on 31 March 2020.

Like other religious groups, the church has come under criticism in light of cases of sexual abuse by clergy and others.

===2022 split===
On 16 August 2022, the church experienced a split when some conservatives formed the breakaway Diocese of the Southern Cross. It is led by a former Archbishop of Sydney, Glenn Davies. The split was principally caused over same sex marriage among other issues. This diocese is backed by the current Archbishop of Sydney, Kanishka Raffel, and the Bishop of Tasmania, Richard Condie. In September 2022, the Diocese of Sydney voted to declare the church to be in a state of &quot;deep breach of fellowship&quot; as a result of the division. The diocese vowed to provide support for orthodox Anglicans both within the Anglican Church of Australia and the breakaway Diocese of the Southern Cross.

==Demographics==

Since the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, the Anglican Church of Australia had been the largest religious denomination until the 1986 census, after which Roman Catholics outnumbered Anglicans by an increasing margin. The percentage of Anglican affiliation peaked in 1921 at 43.7%, and the number of persons indicating Anglican affiliation in an Australian census peaked in 1991 at 4,018,779.

In the 2011 Census, 3,679,907 people named their religious affiliation as Anglican. In the 2016 Census, 3.1 million Australians self-identified as Anglicans. Five years later, in the 2021 Census, the total was 2,496,273 – a decline of almost one-third, 32 per cent. Those figures represented 17.1% and 9.8% respectively of the census populations, a decline of 42%. In 2016, the &quot;Journal of Anglican Studies&quot; stated that of approximately 3.1 million with an Anglican affiliation, the number of active baptised members was 437,880 – about 14%. The steep decline in church membership and attendance has mirrored the experience in many first-world, mostly post-modern nations.

One explanation for the reduced prevalence of Anglicanism relates to changes in Australia&#x27;s immigration patterns. Before the Second World War, the majority of immigrants to Australia had come from the United Kingdom – though most of Australia&#x27;s Roman Catholic immigrants had come from Ireland. After World War II, Australia&#x27;s immigration program diversified and more than 6.5 million migrants arrived in Australia in the 60 years after the war, including more than a million Roman Catholics.

Unlike other churches, the Anglican Church of Australia does not publish churchwide attendance statistics. In 2011, the National Church Life Survey estimated that 155,000 Australians attended an Anglican church weekly, down from 191,600 in 1991. However, the church does tabulate figures on clergy, which are used to allocate diocesan representation at General Synod. In 2015, there were 2,441 active bishops, priests and deacons in the church, up from 2,340 in 1991. 

==Structure==
The Australian church consists of twenty-three dioceses arranged into five provinces (except for Tasmania) with the metropolitical sees in the states&#x27; capital cities. Anglican clergy are concentrated in Australia&#x27;s major cities, with the five metropolitical dioceses accounting for 64 per cent of active clergy. When adding the mixed urban and rural dioceses of Canberra and Goulburn, Newcastle, Northern Territory and Tasmania, urban areas account for 79 per cent of active clergy. The evangelical Diocese of Sydney is by far the largest diocese: in 2011, its 58,300 weekly attenders accounted for 37.6 per cent of the Anglican Church&#x27;s weekly attendance, and in 2015, the diocese&#x27;s 688 active clergy accounted for 28.1 per cent of the active clergy across the church.

Broughton Publishing is the church&#x27;s national publishing arm. 

==Indigenous ministry==
The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Anglican Council (NATSIAC) appoints two Indigenous bishops for national work with indigenous people: the National Aboriginal Bishop (currently Chris McLeod) is based in South Australia (as an assistant bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Adelaide); while the National Torres Strait Islander Bishop (currently vacant) is based at Thursday Island, Queensland (as an assistant bishop of the Anglican Diocese of North Queensland). Gloria Shipp was the first woman elected Chair of NATSIAC.

==Society, arts and culture==

===Welfare and education===
Anglicans have played a prominent role in welfare and education since Colonial times, when First Fleet chaplain Richard Johnson was credited by one convict as &quot;the physician both of soul and body&quot; during the famine of 1790 and was charged with general supervision of schools. Today the church remains a significant provider of social welfare with organisations working in education, health, missionary work, social welfare and communications. Welfare organisations include Anglicare and Samaritans. The Anglicare network comprises 9000 volunteers beyond paid staff, who assisted some 940,000 Australians in 2016 in areas such as emergency relief, aged care, family support and assistance for the homeless.

There are around 145 Anglican schools in Australia, providing for more than 105,000 children. Church schools range from low-fee, regional and special needs schools to high-fee leading independent schools such as Geelong Grammar (whose alumni include Charles III and Rupert Murdoch) and The Kings School in Sydney. Anglican Schools Australia is the national schools network of the general synod.

===Architecture===
The first Church of England edifice was built in the colony of New South Wales in 1793. Today, most towns in Australia have at least one Christian church. One of Australia&#x27;s oldest Anglican churches is St James&#x27; Church in Sydney, built between 1819 and 1824. The historic church was designed by Governor Macquarie&#x27;s architect, Francis Greenway – a former convict – and built with convict labour. The church is set on a sandstone base and built of face brick with the walls articulated by brick piers. Sydney&#x27;s Anglican cathedral, St Andrew&#x27;s, was consecrated in 1868 from foundations laid in the 1830s. Largely designed by Edmund Thomas Blacket in the Perpendicular Gothic style reminiscent of English cathedrals. Blacket also designed St Saviour&#x27;s Cathedral in Goulburn, based on the Decorated Gothic style of a large English parish church and built between 1874 and 1884.

St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne, from a foundation stone laid in 1880, is a Melbourne landmark. It was designed by the distinguished English architect William Butterfield in Gothic Transitional.

Tasmania is home to a number of significant colonial Anglican buildings including those located at Australia&#x27;s best preserved convict era settlement, Port Arthur. According to 19th century notions of prisoner reform, the &quot;Model Prison&quot; incorporates a grim chapel, into which prisoners in solitary confinement were shepherded to listen (in individual enclosures) to the preacher&#x27;s Sunday sermon – their only permitted interaction with another human being. Adelaide, the capital of South Australia has long been known as the &quot;City of Churches&quot; and its St Peter&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral is a noted city landmark.

The oldest building in the city of Canberra is the picturesque St John the Baptist Church in Reid, consecrated in 1845. This church long predates the city of Canberra and is not so much representative of urban design as it is of the Bush chapels which dot the Australian landscape and stretch even into the far Outback.

A number of notable Victorian era chapels and edifices were also constructed at church schools across Australia. Along with community attitudes to religion, church architecture changed significantly during the 20th century.

==Ordination of women==
Since 1985 the church has permitted the ordination of women on a diocesan basis. The first woman to be ordained was Marion Macfarlane, ordained to the &quot;Female Diaconate&quot; in 1884 in the Diocese of Melbourne. In 1992, the first women were ordained as priests, initially in the Diocese of Perth and then around the country. In 2008, the Diocese of Perth consecrated the first female bishop, the Rt Revd Kay Goldsworthy. In 2014, the Diocese of Grafton consecrated and installed the first female diocesan bishop, the Rt Revd Sarah Macneil. Bishop Kay Goldsworthy became the second female diocesan bishop when she was enthroned as bishop of Gippsland then in 2018 she was installed as Archbishop of Perth. The dioceses of Sydney, North West Australia and formerly The Murray did not ordain women as priests. In 2017, the Diocese of The Murray ordained its first female deacon, becoming the last diocese to ordain women to the diaconate. In August 2017, the Anglicans of Western Australia elected the Anglican Church of Australia&#x27;s first female archbishop, Kay Goldsworthy. In a statement representing a conservative and complementarian view, Bishop Gary Nelson said that Archbishop Goldsworthy &quot;would not be recognised in her new role&quot; as the metropolitan for the province.

In June 2023 the Synod of The Murray voted to allow the ordination of women as priests and on 12 August 2023, Bishop Keith Dalby ordained three women and one man to the priesthood. 

Of the 23 Anglican dioceses in Australia, only two have never ordained women to the priesthood: the Diocese of Sydney and the Diocese of North West Australia. The Diocese of Armidale does not generally ordain women to the priesthood but two women were ordained priest for the Anglican girls school. 

== Same-sex unions and LGBT clergy ==

In the Seventeenth Session of the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Australia in 2017, the Anglican Church passed a motion recognising &quot;that the doctrine of our church, in line with traditional Christian teaching, is that marriage is an exclusive and lifelong union of a man and a woman, and further, recognises that this has been the subject of several General Synod resolutions over the past fifteen years&quot;. In 2018, the then-Primate of Australia and Archbishop of Melbourne, Philip Freier, released an &quot;ad clerum&quot; reiterating the current position that clergy cannot perform a same-sex marriage. In 2020, the church&#x27;s highest court, the Appellate Tribunal, ruled that a diocese may authorise the blessing of persons in same-sex unions. At the same time, the church does not have an official stance on homosexuality itself.

During a meeting, the House of Bishops stated that they &quot;accept the weight of 1998 Lambeth Resolution 1.10 and the 2004 General Synod resolutions 33, 59 and 61–64 as expressing the mind of this church on issues of human sexuality ... and understand that issues of sexuality are subject to ongoing conversation&quot;. A former primate, Peter Carnley, supported the blessing of same-sex relationships and supported &quot;recognition of lifelong friendships between two homosexuals which would give them the same legal status as a heterosexual married couple&quot;. A spokesman for Phillip Aspinall, the Archbishop of Brisbane, stated that &quot;In effect it is an undertaking not to ordain, license, authorise or appoint persons whom the bishop knows to be in a sexual relationship outside of marriage.&quot; At the same time, Archbishop Aspinall stated that he personally does not take an official position. Despite what the spokesman said, however, an Anglican priest came out as gay in 2005 in Melbourne. In the Diocese of Perth, &quot;there are gay and lesbian clergy serving in the priesthood.&quot; Archbishop Roger Herft, as a diocesan bishop, &quot;support[ed] blessing gay unions&quot;. In 2012, a bishop &quot;appoint[ed] a gay priest in a same-sex partnership to a Gippsland parish.&quot; The Anglican Diocese of Sydney, the largest of the country, has expressed its opposition to same-sex unions and has been involved in the Anglican realignment as a member of the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans. However, many clergy and bishops support same-sex unions. The Wangaratta and Ballarat dioceses have voted to support the blessing of same-sex civil unions. The dioceses of Wangaratta and Newcastle have approved of blessing rites for same-sex marriages. Blessings for same-sex unions are also permitted in the Diocese of Brisbane. In 2012, the Diocese of Gippsland appointed an openly partnered gay priest. In 2013, the Diocese of Perth voted in favour of recognising same-sex unions. Archbishop Roger Herft vetoed the Perth motion. In 2015, the Bishop of Wangaratta endorsed same-sex marriage legislation and some diocesan clergy offered to perform gay marriages when allowed to do so. In the Diocese of Grafton, former bishop Sarah Macneil took an affirming stance. Bishop Greg Thompson of the Diocese of Newcastle had taken a stance in favour of gay rights.

In 2015, an arm of the Anglican Church in Southern Queensland voted in favour of same-sex civil unions. Also, Bishop Kay Goldsworthy appointed an openly gay and partnered priest to another post. In response, the Sydney synod passed a resolution criticising the actions of the Dioceses of Gippsland and Wangaratta, and declaring a break &quot;of collegiality and fellowship&quot; with the dioceses. In 2016, the Bishop of Ballarat declared his support for same-sex marriage. In April 2016, a parish in the Diocese of Perth blessed the union of a same-sex couple. At its general synod in 2017, a resolution was passed criticising the Scottish Episcopal Church for its acceptance of same-sex marriage as well as an additional resolution calling for the church in Australia &quot;to have a series of conversations on its understanding of sexuality&quot;. Also in 2017, the Diocese of Perth in Western Australia elected Bishop Kay Goldsworthy as its archbishop. Goldsworthy said that she supports an &quot;inclusive&quot; approach to same-sex marriage. &quot;Archbishop Goldsworthy revealed that she had voted Yes in the same-sex marriage survey.&quot; In 2022, Goldsworthy ordained an openly gay man in a civil partnership in Perth. 

Regarding transgender issues, there are dioceses and congregations with serving transgender clergy. In 2017, Archbishop Phillip Aspinall asked for &quot;prayerful support&quot; for the Revd Josephine Inkpin who had transitioned and come out as a transgender woman. &quot;The Archbishop of Brisbane Dr Phillip Aspinall supported Dr Inkpin and passed on her statement to clergy in July 2017, along with his wish that &#x27;unhelpful speculation&#x27; might be avoided.&quot; Inkpin continues to serve in the Brisbane diocese. She shared that the bishops and leaders of the Diocese of Brisbane &quot;have assisted in arrangements for enabling [her] public recognition of gender.&quot; Inkpin, who is married to the Revd Penny Jones, one of the first female priests ordained in Australia, is the first openly transgender priest in Australia. The State Library of Queensland interviewed Inkpin and her wife about the intersection of gender, faith, religion and identity for their &quot;Dangerous Women&quot; podcast.

Controversy over LGBT issues caused a split from the church in 2022: a former Archbishop of Sydney, Glenn Davies, alongside two congregations, left the Anglican Church of Australia to form the newly-formed Diocese of the Southern Cross which is affiliated to the conservative Global Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (GAFCON). The split was endorsed by the Bishop of Tasmania, Richard Condie and the Archbishop of Sydney Kanishka Raffel, but was described as &quot;dangerous for the Church&quot; by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.

* Carpentaria (formerly part of the Province of Queensland, 1900–1996, and now part of the Diocese of North Queensland)
* Kalgoorlie (formerly part of the Province of Western Australia, 1914–1973, and now part of the Diocese of Perth)

* St Arnaud (formerly part of the Province of Victoria, 1926–1976, and now part of the Diocese of Bendigo)

== Ecumenical relations ==
The church is a member of the Christian Conference of Asia.

== Relation with the Anglican realignment==
The Anglican Diocese of Sydney has been a leading name in the Anglican realignment, since they first opposed the sexuality policies of the Episcopal Church of the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada. Archbishop Peter Jensen attended the first Global Anglican Future Conference, in June 2008, in Jerusalem, and was the chairman of GAFCON. The Anglican Diocese of Sydney and the Anglican Diocese of North West Australia have declared themselves in full communion with the Anglican Church in North America, started in June 2009, which represents Anglican realignment in United States and Canada.

The Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans was launched in Australia on 26 March 2015, in a conference held in Melbourne that reunited 460 members, including 40 from New Zealand, and was attended by Archbishop Eliud Wabukala, from the Anglican Church of Kenya, their international chairman, Archbishop Stanley Ntagali, from the Anglican Church of Uganda, and Archbishop Glenn Davies, from the Anglican Diocese of Sydney. The then archdeacon of the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne, now bishop Richard Condie, of the Anglican Diocese of Tasmania, became chairman of FCA Australia.

The Anglican Church of Australia passed a motion at their General Synod on 7 September 2017, condemning the Scottish Episcopal Church decision to approve same-sex marriage as &quot;contrary to the doctrine of our church and the teaching of Christ&quot;, and declaring itself in &quot;impaired communion&quot; with the province. It also expressed &quot;support for those Anglicans who have left or will need to leave (...) because of its redefinition of marriage and those who struggle and remain&quot;, and presented their prayers for the return of SEC &quot;to the doctrine of Christ in this matter&quot; and the restoration of the impaired communion.

The Anglican Church of Australia was represented at GAFCON III, held in Jerusalem on 17–22 June 2018, by a 218 members delegation, which included Archbishop Glenn Davies of Sydney and bishops Richard Condie of Tasmania, Gary Nelson of North West Australia and Ian Palmer of Bathurst.

In 2022 the Diocese of the Southern Cross, established as a company, became the first Anglican diocese in Australia to form outside the Anglican Church of Australia.

<doc id="556508" wikidata="Q653169" url="?curid=556508" title="Prosper Avril">
<text>Matthieu Prosper Avril (born December 12, 1937) is a Haitian political figure who was President of Haiti from 1988 to 1990. A trusted member of François Duvalier&#x27;s Presidential Guard and adviser to Jean-Claude Duvalier, Lt. Gen. Avril led the September 1988 Haitian coup d&#x27;état against a transition military government installed after Jean-Claude Duvalier&#x27;s 1986 overthrow. He was President until March 1990, in a period which according to Amnesty International was &quot;marred by serious human rights violations&quot;. He was arrested in 2001, but released in March 2004 after the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

==Background==
Avril was born in the small town of Thomazeau, near Haiti&#x27;s capital, Port-au-Prince. He joined the army, and graduated at the head of his class in the academy. His wife was a nurse.

==Career==
As a junior officer, Avril served as a member of the presidential guard for François Duvalier. He then became an advisor to Jean-Claude Duvalier upon the latter&#x27;s inauguration in 1971. Duvalier-era government officials told Reuters that Avril oversaw all of Duvalier&#x27;s financial accounts. Avril was forced into retirement by Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1983, but was reinstated and promoted to Colonel in 1986 in the face of the popular revolt that lead to Duvalier&#x27;s overthrow. In a March 1986 interview with the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, Avril declared that Haitian refugees in other countries should be required to apply for visas when visiting Haiti; this would keep out &quot;people who want to foment disorder.&quot; He also predicted that Haiti would have to wait for free elections.

Avril was viewed positively by many fellow members of the armed forces; he was also an academy classmate of Brig. Gen. Williams Regala, one of the leaders of the post-Duvalier military junta. Although the junta members allowed Avril to join the government as a political adviser, he was forced to resign after public demonstrations due to his Duvalier connections. He soon rejoined the presidential guard, and assisted junta chief Henri Namphy in the June 1988 Haitian coup d&#x27;état which overthrew Leslie Manigat. Manigat was a civilian president who had been elected in a military-controlled election; he had taken office in February 1988. Avril was first promoted to brigadier general, then to lieutenant general by Namphy.

===Presidency===
In September 1988, a week after the St. Jean Bosco massacre, Avril overthrew his former ally Namphy in a bloodless coup. As Avril had given few interviews, foreign media sources were unfamiliar with his political views. American policy analyst Larry Birns described Avril as being &quot;particularly corrupt&quot; among the members of the Duvalier regime, but also &quot;intelligent and crafty.&quot;

Avril served as President of Haiti from September 17, 1988 to March 10, 1990. Amnesty International described his rule as &quot;marred by serious human rights violations.&quot; He initially raised goodwill by meeting with social and religious leaders and appointing a civilian cabinet. He also restored the 1987 Constitution of Haiti in March 1989. However, the U.S. government required Avril to crack down on drug trafficking in exchange for foreign aid; his arrests of involved army members dented his popularity. Avril put down a coup attempt by disgruntled officers in April 1989. Civilian opposition groups also demanded that Avril deliver on his promise to hold elections; in response, he began deporting their leaders. He traveled to Taiwan in January 1990 for his first foreign visit. Before his arrival, civil activists informed Taiwan via Telex that any contracts with the military regime would not be recognized by a civilian government. Avril returned home empty-handed; in retaliation, he ordered feces to be dumped outside the offices of opposition groups.

After mass public protests, Avril transferred power to the army chief of staff, Gen. Hérard Abraham, on March 10, 1990. Avril went into exile in Miami, Florida; he moved to the Dominican Republic after he was refused entry into Haiti in 1992. He returned to Haiti in 1993. He fled again in 1995 after the Haitian government moved to arrest him in connection with the assassination of a government official during his time in power. He was finally arrested in 2001, shortly after Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected President, for allegedly plotting against the state. Avril was released in 2002 after an appeals court ruled that the government presented &quot;insufficient evidence&quot;; he was immediately rearrested and charged with organizing a 1990 massacre of farmers. He was freed after Aristide was ousted in the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état.

===Miami===
At the time Aristide came to power, Prosper Avril lived in Miami despite the fact that he would be easily recognizable. This high-profile also made him the target of rumors, and so when two Haitian radio journalists were assassinated during the first weeks and month after Aristide took power, Avril became the target of rumors that declared his involvement. He recounts this experience in his book, &quot;An Appeal to History: The Truth about a Singular Lawsuit&quot;.

<doc id="556509" wikidata="Q334810" url="?curid=556509" title="Abu Bakar Ba'asyir">
<text>Abu Bakar Ba&#x27;asyir (born 17 August 1938), also known as Abu Bakar Bashir, Abdus Somad, and Ustad Abu (&quot;Teacher Abu&quot;) is an Indonesian Muslim cleric and leader of Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid.

He ran the Al-Mukmin boarding school in Ngruki, Central Java, which he co-founded with Abdullah Sungkar in 1972. He was in exile in Malaysia for 17 years during the secular New Order administration of President Suharto resulting from various activities, including urging the implementation of Sharia law.

Intelligence agencies and the United Nations claim he is the spiritual head of Jemaah Islamiyah (also known as JI), best known for the 2002 Bali bombings and which has links with Al-Qaeda. In August 2014, he publicly pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and his declaration of a caliphate.

==Early life, resistance to Suharto, and exile==
Bashir was born in Jombang on 17 August 1938, to a family of Hadhrami Arab and Javanese descent.

During Indonesian President Suharto&#x27;s New Order, Bashir and Sungkar were arrested for a number of reasons, firstly for actively supporting Sharia, the non-recognition of the Indonesian national ideology Pancasila which in part promotes religious pluralism. Secondly, the refusal of their school to salute the Indonesian flag which signified Bashir&#x27;s continual refusal to recognise the authority of a secular Indonesian state. Bashir appealed but was subsequently imprisoned without trial from 1978 to 1982. Soon after his release, Bashir was convicted on similar charges; he was also linked to the bomb attack on the Buddhist temple Borobudur in 1985 but fled to Malaysia. During his years in exile Bashir undertook religious teachings in both Malaysia and Singapore. The United States government alleged that during this period he became involved with Jemaah Islamiyah, a militant Islamist group. Bashir remained in exile until Indonesian President Suharto&#x27;s fall in 1998.

Bashir returned to Indonesia in 1999 and became a cleric, renewing his call for Sharia law.
Ba&#x27;asyir has two sons—Abdul Roshid Ridyo Ba&#x27;asyir, born 31 January 1974 in Sukobarjo, Central Java, Indonesia; and Abdul Rahim Ba&#x27;asyir, born 16 November 1977 in Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia, and a daughter, Zulfur.

==Bali bombings, trial, and imprisonment==
In June 2002, the U.S. government asked Indonesia to turn over Omar Al-Faruq, a member of al-Qaeda and a suspect of terrorist attacks and car bombings. Megawati Sukarnoputri&#x27;s administration captured Al-Faruq and transferred him to American custody, and he was subsequently held in Bagram prison in Afghanistan.

Similarly, US State Department translator Fred Burks revealed during Bashir&#x27;s trial in Indonesia that the USA government had asked President Megawati secretly to hand over Bashir in a meeting at Megawati&#x27;s home in September 2002. Present at that meeting was US ambassador to Indonesia Ralph L. Boyce, National Security Council official Karen Brooks, and an unnamed CIA official.

Megawati refused to transfer Bashir saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t render somebody like him. People will find out&quot;.

On April 14, 2003, he was formally charged by the Indonesian government with treason, immigration violations, and providing false documents and statements to the Indonesian police. The charges are mainly related to the 2000 Christmas Eve bombings against Christian churches, which killed 18 people. In the Indonesian court, he was found not guilty of treason because the state failed to prove its case, but was found guilty on the immigration violations. In a local TV news interview, Metro TV, when asked, &#x27;Are you truly a terrorist?&#x27;; He simply answered, &#x27;No, I&#x27;ve never killed anyone.&#x27; He was sentenced to three years in prison, but the sentence was subsequently reduced to 20 months due to his good behavior in the prison.

On October 15, 2004, he was arrested by the Indonesian authorities and charged with involvement in the bomb attack on the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta on August 5, 2003, which killed 14 people. Secondary charges in the same indictment charge him of involvement in the 2002 Bali bombing, the first time he has faced charges in relation to that attack which killed 202 people and considered Indonesia&#x27;s deadliest terrorist attack. On March 3, 2005, Bashir was found guilty of conspiracy over the 2002 attacks, but was found not guilty of the charges surrounding the 2003 bombing. He was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment.

==Remission and release==
On August 17, 2005, as part of the tradition of remissions for Indonesia&#x27;s Independence Day, Bashir&#x27;s jail term was cut by 4 months and 15 days. On June 14, 2006, to cheers from his supporters waiting outside, Abu Bakar Bashir was released, having served 25+ months in Jakarta&#x27;s Cipinang prison, where he held court and coordinated the publication of a commemorative book with his release. About forty bodyguards in uniform black jackets linked arms to escort Bashir through chanting crowds.

After returning to the boarding school for which he is the spiritual leader, he pledged a renewed campaign to impose Islamic sharia law on Indonesia. He also called Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, to convert to Islam in order to save him from hell and receive God&#x27;s forgiveness. Howard said that Australians would be &quot;extremely disappointed, even distressed&quot; at the news of the release. In August 2006, Bashir claimed that the 2002 Bali bombs were replaced by the American CIA with a &quot;micro-nuclear&quot; weapon. He also claimed the original bombs were only intended to injure people, not kill them - despite the bombers&#x27; own admissions and public testimony. In answer to one reporter&#x27;s question as to what the West and the United States can do to make the world safer, Bashir replied, &quot;They have to stop fighting Islam. That&#x27;s impossible because it is sunnatullah [destiny, a law of nature], as Allah has said in the Qur&#x27;an. If they want to have peace, they have to accept to be governed by Islam.&quot;

On December 21, 2006, Bashir&#x27;s conviction was overturned by Indonesia&#x27;s Supreme Court. He publicly criticised the United Nations because he remained on the body&#x27;s list of international terrorists, saying &quot;I am terrorist number 35 on the list.&quot;

In October 2008, Bashir announced he intends to start a new Islamic group in Indonesia, JAT or Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid (&quot;partisans of the oneness of God&quot;), at the time the Indonesian government was preparing to execute the three Bali bombers. Bashir repeated his claim that a nuclear device was released by the CIA, saying the attack was conspiracy between &quot;America, Australia and the Jews&quot;
In February 2012, the US Department of State website stated that JAT was responsible for multiple coordinated attacks against innocent civilians, police and military personnel in Indonesia. &quot;JAT has robbed banks and carried out other illicit activities to fund the purchase of assault weapons, pistols and bomb-making materials&quot;, so JAT is put on US terror list.

==2010 arrest and conviction==
On December 13, 2010, Indonesian police charged Bashir with involvement in plans of terror and military training in Aceh. The charge against him of inciting others to commit terrorism, carries the death penalty.

In February 2011, Bashir denied the charges of terrorism against him.

===Conviction===
On June 16, 2011, Bashir was convicted of supporting a jihadi training camp following a four-month trial. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was acquitted of the charge of involvement in the 2002 Bali bombings. However, after an appeal the Jakarta High Court reduced his sentence to nine years.
Finally, the Supreme Court has rejected the appeal of Abu Bakar Bashir and annulled the Jakarta High Court sentence then reinstated the South Jakarta District Court&#x27;s original 15-year sentence.

===Imprisonment and release===

In January 2019 it was rumored that president Joko Widodo was considering the release of Bashir due to old age and declining health. The move was seen as controversial in Indonesia as part of a growing number of actions taken by Widodo to appease Indonesia&#x27;s conservative Muslims ahead of the 2019 presidential election. However, on January 23, after pressure from Australia and the families of victims of the Bali bombing, the move to release Bashir was cancelled as he refused to pledge allegiance to the state ideology of Pancasila which was one of the terms of his release.

While in prison, Bashir received 55 months of sentence reductions. In 2014, he reportedly pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

On January 8, 2021, Bashir was released from a Jakarta prison at the conclusion of his sentence. Indonesian authorities said that he would be entered into a deradicalisation programme.

==Views and controversies==
Abu Bakar Bashir has been described as the ideological godfather of Jemaah Islamiyah, even though no evidence has been made public that specifically implicates Bashir in terrorist attacks undertaken by the clandestine group. He has claimed that Jemaah Islamiyah doesn&#x27;t exist and that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israel were behind terror attacks in Indonesia including the 2002 Bali bombings After open confessions from the bombers, Bashir claimed in August 2006 that the Bali bombs were &quot;replaced&quot; by a &quot;micro-nuclear&quot; weapon by the CIA. Bashir has expressed sympathy for Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, but that he didn&#x27;t &quot;agree with all of their actions,&quot; in particular &quot;total war.&quot; He further stated &quot;...If this occurs in an Islamic country, the &quot;fitnah&quot; [discord] will be felt by Muslims. But to attack them in their country [America] is fine.&quot; He has claimed the 9/11 attacks were a false flag attack by America and Israel as a pretext to attack Muslims in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In a speech following the Bali attacks Bashir stated, &quot;I support Osama bin Laden&#x27;s struggle because his is the true struggle to uphold Islam.&quot; The Indonesian Islamic cleric is portrayed strongly in Western media as an extremist who inspires deadly actions.

He has stated his belief that Indonesia must adhere to &quot;Sharia&quot; law and has renewed his calls for an Islamic state in Indonesia.

There is no nobler life than to die as a martyr for jihad. None. The highest deed in Islam is Jihad. If we commit to Jihad, we can neglect other deeds, even fasting and prayer.*

He founded the Indonesian Mujahedeen Council (MMI), a coalition of Islamist groups promoting the implementation of Islamic law in Indonesia. In August 2008, Bashir resigned his position as the council&#x27;s supreme leader, charging that the groups internal democratic structure contradicted Islam, and stated that he should have absolute power within the organization.

Controversy surrounding Abu Bakar Bashir heightened in early 2008 after a sermon given by the cleric in late 2007. Bashir allegedly refers to tourists in Bali as &quot;worms, snakes and maggots&quot; with specific reference to the immorality of Australian infidels. Bashir states, The young must be first at the front line, don&#x27;t hide at the back. You must be at the front, dies as martyrs and all your sins will be forgiven. This is how to achieve forgiveness... As described by Natasha Robinson, Bashir has returned to his hardline rhetoric. His early release from prison has been described as the catalyst to his revitalised, hardline approach towards non-Muslims. Bashir&#x27;s view on non-Muslims is highlighted in this statement made in East Java in 2006, &quot;God willing, there are none here, if there were infidels here, just beat them up. Do not tolerate them.&quot; Bashir&#x27;s specific mention of Australian tourists has created uproar among government officials and the Australian media regarding the cleric&#x27;s intolerant comments. Australia&#x27;s Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith views Bashir&#x27;s comments in late 2007 as being full of the intolerance that has marked many of Bashir&#x27;s previous speeches.

The cleric has also previously warned of severe retribution if the Bali bombers, who killed 202 people in 2002, be executed by firing squad. On March 24, 2008 the bombers, who were on death row, lost almost any hope of escaping the death penalty as their lawyer, Fahmi Bachmid, withdrew from their last appeal. The Bali bombers were executed by firing squad at 12:15 am on 9 November 2008.

In July 2014, an imprisoned Bashir pledged allegiance, or &quot;Bay&#x27;ah&quot;, to the militant Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

==Release==

On January 8, 2021, he was released from prison, nearly 20 years since the day of the attack.

== Subsequent acknowledgement of Pancasila ==
On 1 August 2022, a viral video went viral to the public. In the video, Bashir acknowledged his wrongs and apparently acknowledging Pancasila as national ideology after years disavowed it. His son, Abdul Rochim acknowledged that the video is original and made 3 to 4 months prior went viral. His son claimed that Bashir already accepted Pancasila but do not agree with groups or teachings that clashed Pancasila with Islam. However in 20 August 2022, he changed his mind and said that while he agreed on the first principle of Pancasila’s “Belief in the Almighty God”, he expressed his rejection of those who did not use ‘Godly’ laws as the form of the country’s governance and neglected the use of non-religious ‘man made’ laws in a system of democracy. He further added that Indonesia is a &#x27;taghut country&#x27;. The &#x27;Thaghut country&#x27; is a state that does not follow Allah&#x27;s orders. He said that since Sukarno&#x27;s time, the law of monotheism had been discarded in Indonesia. What is enforced in Indonesia is the law of shirk, namely democracy. &quot;What we have to do now is work hard to make Indonesia implement Islamic law because Indonesia is actually supposed to be an Islamic state. But successive governments have not been willing to implement it,&quot; the cleric said.

<doc id="556512" wikidata="Q60738777" url="?curid=556512" title="Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics">
<text>Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics (HKOI; 香港電腦奧林匹克競賽) is an annual programming competition for secondary school students in Hong Kong, emphasizing on problem solving techniques and programming skills. It is co-organized by the Hong Kong Association for Computer Education (HKACE) and the Hong Kong Education Bureau (EDB). It serves as a preliminary contest to international, national and regional competitions such as the China National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) and the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). The first HKOI was held in 1997.

==History==
Hong Kong first participated in IOI in 1992. In order select representatives for the Hong Kong Delegation Team, a selection test was held a few months before the competition. In the following years, Hong Kong started sending teams to other competitions, including the SEARCC International Schools&#x27; Software Competition (ISSC) in 1993, the Software Competition for the Youths (SCY) in 1994 and the China National Olympiad in Informatics in 1995. Selection tests were separately administered for these competitions, and the purpose of each test was solely to select team members for the competitions. A considerable amount of resources were used to organize these tests. The tests were not very popular among students in Hong Kong.

In 1996, the Hong Kong Association for Computer Education, the Hong Kong Computer Society and the Education Department of Hong Kong (now the Education Bureau) jointly organized the Joint Selection Contest to replace all the selection tests. 39 students were selected as seeds for the Hong Kong teams. They received intensive training on topics like data structures and algorithms. After that, a Team Formation Test was conducted to select the Hong Kong representatives in IOI and NOI among the seeds. Another Team Formation Test was conducted for the SEARCC-ISSC and SCY. 

In 1997, the Joint Selection Contest was renamed as the Hong Kong Olympiad in Informatics. Prizes are awarded to students with good results in HKOI, who are then invited to join the HKOI Training Team. Due to the limit on the number of participants from each school, some schools organize their own team formation test to select students to take part in HKOI.

==Structure of the Competition==

===Groupings===
The participants of HKOI are divided into two groups. The Junior Group consists of students aged 17 or below, and the Senior Group consists of students aged 19 or below. The rationale of having two groups with one having an age limit of 17 is that SEARCC-ISSC requires all participants to be aged 17 or below. Another advantage of having a Junior Group is to allow more young students to enter the HKOI training team without having to compete with the more experienced senior students.

===Competition format===
The competition format of the HKOI has changed a few times since the introduction of Joint Selection Contest in 1996.

The Joint Selection Contest was conducted in written format. All programs were written down on the answer sheet. It was difficult for both participants and markers. The participants could not rely on a computer to verify the correctness of their programs, while the markers had to read every line of the program and try to understand the underlying algorithm.

In 1997, the competition was split into the heat and final event. The heat event consists of a written paper. Outstanding students in the heat event proceed to enter the 2-hour final event, which consists of programming tasks similar to those in IOI. The heat event was essential due to the limited number of computers provided for the final event. However, this change in the competition format did not eliminate the need for marking based on hand-written programs.

In 1998, the heat event was replaced by a pre-competition assessment. All participants were asked to work on the pre-competition assessment task and submit a floppy diskette containing the source code and executable of their programs. The list of finalist were determined solely by the programs submitted. However, it raised concerns about the fairness of the competition, since there is no way to ensure that the submitted program was really written by the participant. At that time, the only programming language allowed was Pascal.

In 1999, the heat event was reinstalled. This time, the heat event consisted of a single paper of Multiple choice problems to improve the efficiency in marking papers. This was important as the number of participants had increased to several hundred students. In 2000, the duration of the final event increased to 3 hours. In 2003, Fill-in-the-blank problems were added to the heat event, aiming to add a new dimension to the question paper. In 2004, C and C++  were added to the list of allowed programming languages.

As of 2009, the competition consists of a heat event with Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-blanks problems, while the final event consists of 5 programming tasks to be solved in 3 hours. The programming languages allowed are Pascal, C and C++. Different sets of problem are used for junior and senior group respectively.

Since 2015/16, the number of tasks is reduced to 4 (no more question 0, ie. enumeration), and the format are more like IOI (batch score and real time feedback).

===Awards===
About half of the finalists are awarded prizes. Prizes are awarded in Gold, Silver and Bronze, in the ratio of approximately 1:2:3. Only the performance in the final event is considered. Students in junior group and senior group are ranked separately. Prize winners are invited to join the HKOI Training Team for intensive training. A Team Formation Test is usually held at around May to select delegates for IOI and NOI.

==Important people==

<text>Gail Berman (born August 17, 1956) is an American producer and television executive. She is co-owner and founding partner of The Jackal Group, a production entity formed in partnership with Fox Networks Group. The Jackal Group develops and produces scripted, unscripted and factual entertainment programming for FNG&#x27;s channels, including Fox Broadcasting Company, FX/FXX, the National Geographic Channels, and Fox International Channels. The partnership also provides for opportunities in digital and film, as well as for non-21st Century Fox distribution entities.

==Early life==
Berman was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn. The family soon moved to Bellmore, New York, where she was raised. In 1974, she graduated from Abington High School and in 1978, she graduated with a B.A. in theater from the University of Maryland.

==Career==

Berman graduated from the University of Maryland, where she served on the board of trustees. Berman also serves on the board of directors of the Center Theatre Group, a non-profit company that oversees the Ahmanson Theatre, the Mark Taper Forum and the Kirk Douglas Theatre. Berman is married to sitcom writer Bill Masters and they have two children.

Berman began her career as a theater producer after graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theater from the University of Maryland. At 23, she and her college friend Susan Rose co-produced their first Broadway show, the original Broadway production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;, which went on to garner seven Tony Award nominations. Berman&#x27;s other Broadway productions include &quot;Hurlyburly&quot; by David Rabe (1984), Athol Fugard&#x27;s &quot;Blood Knot&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Nerd&quot; by Larry Shue (1987), all of which received Tony Award nominations.

Berman served as president and CEO of production company Sandollar Television. During her six years with Sandollar, Berman also served as executive producer on the primetime series &quot;All American Girl&quot; starring Margaret Cho. During this time, Berman criticized Cho&#x27;s appearance, spurring Cho to lose weight rapidly enough to experience acute kidney failure.

Berman next served as founding president of Regency Television, the TV studio created in 1998 as a co-venture between Fox Television Studios and New Regency Productions. Under Berman, Regency Television&#x27;s programs included &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; and &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;.

Then, Berman served from 2000 to 2005 as president of Entertainment for Fox Broadcasting Company. At Fox, Berman was in charge of all program development and scheduling as well as marketing, business affairs, and promotions. Network shows under Berman&#x27;s tenure included &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;The Simple Life&quot;, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Nanny 911&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; (in which she also produced for Regency TV), &quot;The War at Home&quot;, &quot;House&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;Bones&quot;, &quot;Prison Break&quot;, &quot;The O.C&quot;, and both Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s &quot;American Dad!&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot; (the latter was originally launched under Doug Herzog&#x27;s watch, but became an overnight success during Berman&#x27;s era). During this time, Berman infamously canceled the cult classic TV series &quot;Firefly&quot; following decisions to place it in the “Friday night death slot” and air the episodes out of order.

Berman served as executive producer on both &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Angel&quot;, and was reported to be involved with the reboot of &quot;Buffy&quot; being developed in 2018.

Berman became president of Paramount Pictures in March 2005 and was responsible for the studio&#x27;s annual slate of films, including the acquisition of literary properties, development, budgeting, casting, and the production of motion pictures for Paramount Pictures, MTV Films and Nickelodeon Movies. She left Paramount in January 2007.

Prior to founding The Jackal Group in 2014, Berman spent seven years as the co-founder and co-owner of the media company BermanBraun with Lloyd Braun, which was an innovator in the digital arena, creating and operating successful online brands. The company&#x27;s properties have included reality and scripted programs as well as live-action and animated projects; the most notable program that was produced by the company would be the game show &quot;Duel&quot;, which aired on ABC between December 2007 and July 2008. In February 2014, Braun became the sole owner of BermanBraun, renaming the company Whalerock Industries.

Before BermanBraun, Berman was the first and only female executive to hold the top posts at both a major film studio and television network.

In 2019, Fox Corporation and Berman&#x27;s Jackal Group announced their partnership on a new production venture called SideCar, described as a content development accelerator. Fox will be the sole owner of all series that originate under the SideCar banner. The accelerator&#x27;s development slate includes &quot;Mr. Black&quot;, the animated comedy &quot;Saloon&quot;, and the drama &quot;The Perfect Couple&quot;. In October 2020, Berman signed on to executive produce the streaming series &quot;Wednesday&quot;.

<text>Charles Elson &quot;Buddy&quot; Roemer III (October 4, 1943 – May 17, 2021) was an American politician, investor, and banker who served as the 52nd governor of Louisiana from 1988 to 1992, and as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1988. In March 1991, while serving as governor, Roemer switched affiliation from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.

Roemer was a candidate for the presidential nominations of the Republican Party and the Reform Party in 2012. He withdrew from those contests and sought the 2012 Americans Elect presidential nomination until that group announced it would not field a candidate in 2012 because no candidate reached the required minimum threshold of support to be listed on its ballot. Roemer eventually endorsed Libertarian Gary Johnson, former governor of New Mexico, for president in the 2012 general election.

Roemer served on the Advisory Council of Represent.Us, a nonpartisan anti-corruption organization.

== Early life, education, and early career ==

Buddy Roemer was born on October 4, 1943, in Shreveport, the son of Charles Elson &quot;Budgie&quot; Roemer, II (1923–2012) and the former Adeline McDade (1923–2016). Roemer&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Ross McDade, married a sister of the maternal grandmother of James C. Gardner, a former mayor of Shreveport. Gardner knew Roemer&#x27;s grandfather as &quot;Uncle Ross&quot;. McDade&#x27;s wife died, and he remarried, from which union came Adeline Roemer. Roemer and Gardner were not close politically.

Roemer was reared on the family&#x27;s Scopena plantation near Bossier City. He attended public schools and graduated in 1960 as valedictorian of Bossier High School. In 1964, he graduated from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. In 1967, he received an MBA in finance from Harvard Business School.

Following college, Roemer returned to Louisiana to work in his father&#x27;s computer business and later founded two banks. He was elected in 1972 as a delegate to the Louisiana Constitutional Convention held in 1973. Among the Shreveport-area delegates who served with Roemer was his future gubernatorial advisor Robert G. Pugh, future U.S. District Judge Tom Stagg, and former Louisiana State Representative Frank Fulco.

Roemer&#x27;s father had been in 1971 the campaign manager for Edwin Edwards and became commissioner of administration during Edwards&#x27; first term as governor. Buddy Roemer worked on the Edwards campaign as a regional leader and later started a political consulting firm.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

As a member of Congress, Roemer represented Louisiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district in the northwestern section of the state, which includes Shreveport and Bossier City.

===Elections===
In 1978, Roemer ran in the nonpartisan blanket primary for the 4th district congressional seat, which was vacated by popular incumbent Joe Waggonner, also from Bossier Parish. Waggonner announced his opposition to Roemer after Roemer criticized the excessive costs of the Red River navigation program, which Waggoner favored. Roemer finished third in the primary, 1,708 votes behind Democratic State Representative Buddy Leach, with Republican Jimmy Wilson, a former state representative from Vivian in northern Caddo Parish, in second. Leach went on to defeat Wilson by 266 votes in a disputed general election.

In 1980, Roemer and Wilson again challenged Leach in the primary; also running was State Senator Foster Campbell of Bossier Parish. In another close race, Wilson finished in third place, Roemer ranked second, and Leach led the field with 29 percent. In the general election, with the support of Wilson, Roemer handily defeated Leach, who had the support of Campbell, many other state legislators, and former Governor Edwards, 64 to 36 percent.

After his 1980 election victory, Roemer won re-election without opposition in 1982, 1984, and 1986.

===Tenure===
In Congress, Roemer frequently supported Ronald Reagan&#x27;s policy initiatives and fought with the Democratic congressional leadership, though he remained in the party. He also criticized then Democratic House leader Tip O&#x27;Neill of Massachusetts for being &quot;too liberal&quot;, and was in turn characterized by Speaker O&#x27;Neill as being &quot;often wrong but never in doubt&quot;.

After Roemer left the House to become governor, he was succeeded by his administrative assistant, Republican Jim McCrery.

In 1981, Roemer joined forty-seven other House Democrats in supporting the passage of the Reagan tax cuts, strongly opposed by Speaker O&#x27;Neill and Roemer&#x27;s fellow Louisiana Democrat Gillis William Long of Alexandria.

In 1984, Roemer again broke with O&#x27;Neill to support Reagan&#x27;s request for U.S. aid to El Salvador, which Roemer described as &quot;a freedom-loving country.&quot; Roemer was among the congressional observers in the El Salvador national election.

In 1988, Roemer claimed that Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis made &quot;a much better choice in terms of politics and impact on Louisiana&quot; in choosing U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for his vice presidential running mate than did Republican George H. W. Bush made in choosing Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana. Roemer, as the host governor and still a Democrat, welcomed the Republicans to New Orleans, where delegates at the Republican National Convention nominated Bush and Quayle.

===Committee assignments===
In his first term in Congress, Roemer was denied a seat on the Banking Committee by the Democratic leadership and instead was assigned to the Public Works and Transportation Committee due to Roemer having voted with the Republican minority on extending the debate on House rules proposed by the Democratic majority. He was a member of the &quot;boll weevil&quot; and the Conservative Democratic Forum.

== Governor of Louisiana ==

=== 1987 gubernatorial election ===

Roemer was one of a large number of Democratic candidates to challenge three-term incumbent governor Edwin Edwards, whose flamboyant personality and reputation for questionable ethical practices had polarized voters. Other candidates challenging Edwards in the primary were U.S. Representatives Bob Livingston, a suburban New Orleans Republican, and Billy Tauzin, a Democrat from Lafourche Parish. Outgoing Secretary of State James H. &quot;Jim&quot; Brown, a lawyer from Ferriday in Concordia Parish, also challenged Edwards.

While Edwards faced a wide field, Roemer&#x27;s candidacy had a poignant aspect. His father, Charles E. Roemer II, had been Edwards&#x27; top aide and campaign manager during Edwards&#x27; first term as governor. In the 1972 campaign, Buddy Roemer had claimed that Edwards as governor &quot;will listen to the people and to public officials who represent the people before acting on any problems in the state.&quot; In 1981, Roemer&#x27;s father had gone to prison on conviction of selling state insurance contracts. During the election he was advised by Gordon Hensley.

Roemer launched a fiery campaign against Edwards, calling for a &quot;Roemer Revolution&quot;, where he would &quot;scrub the budget&quot;, overhaul the education system, reform campaign finance rules, and slash the state bureaucracy by &quot;bricking up the top three floors of the Education Building.&quot; Perhaps the key moment in the 1987 race came at a forum among the candidates. As usual, the main topic of discussion was Edwin Edwards. His challengers were asked, in succession, if they would consider endorsing Edwards in the general election if they didn&#x27;t make it to the runoff. The candidates hedged, particularly Secretary of State Jim Brown. The last candidate to speak was Roemer: &quot;No, we&#x27;ve got to slay the dragon. I would endorse anyone but Edwards.&quot; The next day, as political commentator John Maginnis put it, Brown was explaining his statement while Roemer was ordering &quot;Slay the Dragon&quot; buttons. Boosted by his endorsement as the &#x27;good government candidate&#x27; by nearly every newspaper in the state, Roemer stormed from last place in the polls and on election night, overtook Edwards and placed first in the primary election, with 33 percent of the vote compared with Edwards&#x27; 28 percent.

Edwards, recognizing he faced certain defeat, made the surprise announcement on election night that he would concede the race to Roemer. By withdrawing, Edwards denied Roemer the opportunity to build a governing coalition in the general election race, thus denying him a decisive majority victory. The defeated Edwards virtually ceded control of the state to Roemer even before the inauguration.

===Tenure as governor===
Roemer entered the governor&#x27;s office on March 14, 1988. In April 1988, under executive order, Roemer named William Hawthorn Lynch, a long-term investigative journalist who at the time was with the Baton Rouge bureau of the &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot;, as the state&#x27;s first inspector general. Lynch was empowered to investigate corruption, governmental inefficiencies, and misuse of state equipment. He remained in that position until his death in 2004. Roemer named the one-year state representative Dennis Stine of Lake Charles, a timber businessman, as the commissioner of administration, a post Stine held until the end of Roemer&#x27;s term.

In October 1989, voters rejected a number of Roemer tax initiatives but approved a State constitutional amendment for transportation improvements.

Facing a $1.3 billion deficit in the state budget, his first job was eliminating the deficit. Roemer&#x27;s first chief of staff, Len Sanderson, Jr., who had been a journalist with the &quot;Alexandria Daily Town Talk&quot;, had run Roemer&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign and was a close confidant. He represented the reform-minded agenda that had redefined Louisiana politics during Roemer&#x27;s first session. According to Ron Gomez, Roemer&#x27;s secretary of natural resources and a former legislator from Lafayette, the LSU-educated Sanderson &quot;with his blond hair spilling to below shoulder length, stepped on so many toes and got into so many faces that he didn&#x27;t make it into the second year.&quot; After another interim appointment, Roemer named former State Representative P.J. Mills of Shreveport as chief of staff, to, in the words of Gomez, &quot;bring some maturity and experience to the office.&quot; Other sources maintain that Sanderson was an effective chief of staff who left office solely to rehabilitate from a tragic automobile accident. The majority of reform legislation was passed during the first months of the Roemer administration while Sanderson was chief of staff. Many said that Sanderson&#x27;s departure could have been a turning point when the &quot;revolutionary character&quot; of the administration moved from the successful reform platform toward a more traditional political agenda.

Roemer also hired the political consultant and pollster Elliott Stonecipher of Shreveport.

Roemer called a special session of the legislature to push an ambitious tax and fiscal reform program for state and local governments. He vowed to slash spending, abolish programs, and close state-run institutions. Voters rejected his proposals in a statewide constitutional referendum.

As governor, Roemer worked to boost lagging teacher pay and toughened laws on campaign finance. State employees and retirees received small pay increases too, the first in many years of austere state budgets. Roemer was also the first governor in recent state history to put a priority on protecting the environment. His secretary of the Department of Environmental Quality, Paul Templet, repeatedly angered Louisiana&#x27;s politically powerful oil and gas industry. The legislature, dominated by supporters of Edwards, repeatedly opposed Roemer&#x27;s initiatives.

State Representative Bruce M. Bolin of Minden, later a state district court judge, supported Roemer&#x27;s early reform efforts: &quot;the state can&#x27;t be everything to everybody, and the new budget reflects that.&quot; Bolin also correctly predicted that Roemer would in time run for president, but Roemer did not seek the White House for another twenty-four years. To make a presidential run, Bolin said that Roemer &quot;needs no political baggage&quot; and that Louisiana &quot;must be viewed as a progressive state&quot; for him to be able to accomplish that goal. Edward J. Steimel, executive director of the pro-business lobby, the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, also applauded Roemer&#x27;s early reform efforts. Business, said Steimel, achieved half of its goals in the 1988 legislative session. Another session of equal outcome, he added, could make the state competitive with its neighbors within a year.

Also in 1989, the Louisiana Board of Appeals recommended a pardon for political prisoner and victim of extreme racism during the racial integration of Louisiana&#x27;s public schools, Gary Tyler. Notwithstanding Governor Roemer&#x27;s own father, Charles E. Roemer, II having been a strong advocate for African-American Civil Rights in his own political career in Louisiana, Governor Roemer refused to consider a pardon for Tyler in a racially charged environment where David Duke was gaining popularity and rising to prominent political power. Gary Tyler had been in prison 14 years as of 1989, and as a result of Governor Roemer&#x27;s decision to refuse to consider the appeal, he would go on to serve an additional 27 years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary before finally being released in 2016.

In 1990, Roemer vetoed a bill – authored by Democratic Senator Mike Cross and supported by the influential Republican Senator Fritz H. Windhorst of Gretna and state Senate President, Allen Bares of Lafayette. Bares had been supported by Roemer as Senate president over Sydney B. Nelson of Shreveport, who had been politicking behind the scenes for months for the position. After two years, senators removed Bares from the position and returned previous president Sammy Nunez of Chalmette in St. Bernard Parish, it was seen as a striking rebuke to Roemer.

The Cross bill sought to ban abortion in cases of rape and incest and imposed fines of up to $100,000 and ten years imprisonment on the practitioners, Roemer declared the legislation incompatible with the United States Supreme Court decision &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. His veto alienated large numbers of his socially conservative electoral base. The legislature subsequently overrode Roemer&#x27;s veto with an even larger margin than in the original bill. State Representative Woody Jenkins of Baton Rouge, one of the leading abortion foes in the legislature, said the prohibition regarding rape and incest is needed to prevent women from filing false claims in such matters. State Senator Sydney Nelson said that he opposed the abortion ban because of the problems of unwanted children and defective births. Nevertheless, in 1991, United States District Judge Adrian G. Duplantier of New Orleans, a former state senator, ruled that the measure was in conflict with &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and the 1991 companion ruling &quot;Planned Parenthood of Pennsylvania v. Casey&quot;.

Roemer came under fire for hiring a friend to teach positive thinking to his staff. Staffers were asked to wear rubber bands on their wrists and were told to snap a band whenever they had negative thoughts. Earlier, in 1989, Roemer had separated from his second wife, the former Patti Crocker, with the divorce final in 1990, after seventeen years of marriage. His widow is Patti Crocker Marchiafava of Elkin, North Carolina; the couple had one child, Dakota Frost Roemer, a businessman in Baton Rouge, who in 2012 married the former Heather Rae Gatte, daughter of Nacis and Patty Gatte of Iota, Louisiana.

Roemer presided over the legalization of a state lottery and controversial riverboat gambling, initiatives some reformers opposed. In 1991, with his support, the legislature legalized fifteen floating casinos throughout Louisiana and video poker at bars and truck stops throughout the state. He left office before the riverboat casinos or video poker went on line.

===1991 party switch===

In March 1991, Roemer switched to the Republican Party just months before the state elections, apparently at the urging of Bush White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. Roemer, as a new Democratic governor, had appeared at the 1988 Republican Convention in New Orleans to greet the delegates. The convention was held in New Orleans through the urging of longtime Louisiana Republican National Committeewoman Virginia Martinez, who had worked for Livingston in the previous campaign. She was also the chairman of the 1988 Host Committee.

Roemer&#x27;s late-term party switch dismayed as many Republican politicians and activists as it did Democrats. One irate Republican was the state party chairman, Billy Nungesser of New Orleans. Failing to get the Louisiana Republicans&#x27; endorsement convention canceled, Roemer skipped the event. The convention, as expected, endorsed U.S. Representative Clyde C. Holloway, the favored candidate of the anti-abortion forces in the state, with whom Roemer was at odds at the time.

===1991 gubernatorial election===
The 1991 gubernatorial contest included Roemer, Edwin Edwards, David Duke, and Eighth District Congressman Clyde Holloway of Forest Hill, who all ran in Louisiana&#x27;s open primary. Roemer was wounded by his mistakes as governor, while Edwards and Duke each had a passionate core group of supporters. Roemer placed third in the primary. One of the contributing factors to Roemer&#x27;s defeat in the 1991 primary was a last-minute advertising barrage by Marine Shale owner Jack Kent. Marine Shale had been targeted by the Roemer administration as a polluter. Kent spent $500,000 of his own money in the closing days of the campaign to purchase anti-Roemer commercials.

Roemer&#x27;s defeat led to a nationally watched runoff election between Duke and Edwards. Faced with the alternative of David Duke, many Louisianans who were otherwise critical of Edwards now supported Edwards. This included Buddy Roemer, who had run on an &quot;Anyone but Edwards&quot; platform. He ended up endorsing Edwards rather than Duke, who was the putative Republican candidate.

As Roemer left the governorship, he predicted that his &quot;unheralded&quot; accomplishments would become obvious in the fourth Edwards term. According to Roemer, a key factor in his defeat for a second term was his alienation of special interests.

As of the 2023 election, Roemer is the last governor to have hailed from northern Louisiana.

==Post-gubernatorial career==

Immediately after leaving office as governor, Roemer taught a course in economics for the spring semester 1992 at his alma mater, Harvard University.

=== The Sterling Group, Inc. (1992–1997) ===

After the 1991 election cycle concluded, Roemer teamed up with a long-time friend, Joseph Traigle, to form The Sterling Group, Inc. The two met in the late 1960s in Shreveport, where they were both active in the Junior Chamber International.

The Sterling Group specializes in international trade of plastic raw materials between the United States and Mexico. Roemer served as the chairman of the board and Traigle served as president. Roemer was a strong supporter of improving Louisiana and U.S. trade with Mexico. Traigle bought Roemer out of the company in 1997.

=== 1995 gubernatorial election ===
In 1995, Roemer attempted a political comeback when he again ran for governor. Having been squeezed out in 1991 between Edwards and Duke, Roemer chose to run on a much more conservative platform in 1995, emphasizing an anti-crime and anti-welfare stance. For example, he called for prisoner chain gangs to clean up litter on state highways. Roemer held a wide lead for much of the campaign, but faded in the days before the primary election as State Senator Mike Foster, who switched affiliation from Democratic to Republican during the campaign, took conservative votes away from him. As a result, Roemer finished fourth with 18 percent of the vote, two percentage points from making the runoff, called the general election in Louisiana.

===2004 U.S. Senate election===

In the summer of 2004, Roemer briefly considered entering the race to succeed retiring U.S. Senator John Breaux. Roemer passed on the race, and Republican U.S. Representative David Vitter of Louisiana&#x27;s 1st congressional district, which includes suburban New Orleans, was elected to succeed Breaux. Vitter represented the house district held from 1977 to 1999 by Republican Bob Livingston, one of Roemer&#x27;s gubernatorial rivals in 1987.

===Later business career===

Having met without success at his political comeback, Roemer turned his attention to investing and banking. He formed a company that built retirement housing near universities, with alumni from each university being the target buyers. He also founded Business First Bank, based in Baton Rouge, of which he was the President and CEO, and his daughter-in-law, Heather, is the assistant vice president of human resources.

In June 2005, Roemer underwent triple bypass heart surgery at the Baton Rouge General Medical Center. In 2008, Roemer supported and campaigned for U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona for U.S. president.

In 2000, Roemer was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

Ron Gomez (a Lafayette politicist) said that he believes Roemer &quot;could have been one of Louisiana&#x27;s great governors. The state&#x27;s horrible financial condition when he took office, his dependence on an inexperienced and sometimes rashly immature staff in his first year or so, an overly-ambitious legislative agenda, and his own unpredictable dealings with individual legislators all contributed to the failures he suffered. Ultimately, all of these factors led to his running third, as the incumbent, in the 1991 gubernatorial election.&quot; Gomez describes Roemer as &quot;a dynamic orator who could light up an audience with his first two sentences. When he got wound up it was truly evangelical, and he made sense. His wiry, five foot seven, one-hundred thirty-five pound frame would seem to uncoil and grow as he outlined his vision as a fighter against crime, corruption and waste in government, poor education, taxes and industrial pollution.&quot;

In April 2014, Roemer became a partner at The Young Turks, an online progressive news network founded and run by Cenk Uygur. Roemer&#x27;s firm - Roemer, Robinson, Melville &amp; Co, LLC - invested $4 million into the company. According to Uygur, the two met and bonded over their shared support of campaign finance reform, an issue that both Uygur and Roemer supported and have spoken about extensively for many years. According to their investment agreement, Roemer&#x27;s firm is granted a seat on The Young Turks&#x27; advisory board, but does not enjoy editorial or content control.

===2012 presidential candidacy===
In January 2011, Roemer told Baton Rouge television station WAFB that he was considering a bid for the U.S. presidency in 2012. On July 21, 2011, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, Roemer announced his entry as a candidate for the Republican nomination for president.

On March 3, 2011, Roemer announced the formation of an exploratory committee to prepare for a possible run for the 2012 presidential nomination of the Republican Party. Roemer stressed that campaign finance reform would be a key issue in his campaign. Pledging to limit campaign contributions to $100 (~$ in ) per individual, Roemer appeared as one of five candidates at a 2011 March forum in Iowa sponsored by the Faith and Freedom Coalition. But he was not invited to any of the Republican debates because he failed to meet the 7 percent minimum criterion for popularity in polls. He was not even included as an option in several polls until the 2012 Iowa Caucus and the 2012 New Hampshire primary in early January. Instead Roemer attempted to reach audiences through social media, including tweeting responses to debates in which he could not participate. His donations averaged $30,000 a month, far below what is raised by the front runners. This difference in campaign fundraising may be attributed to the fact that Roemer limited donations to $100 (~$ in ) per U.S. citizen, and denied all PAC, Super PAC, and corporate donations. His campaign garnered some visibility when Roemer starred in an advertisement for Stephen Colbert&#x27;s Super PAC, in November 2011. The ad lampooned the flimsiness of legal restrictions against Super PACs coordinating with the candidates they support.
* On November 30, 2011, Roemer announced that he would seek the Americans Elect nomination.
* On February 23, 2012, Roemer dropped out of the GOP nomination to seek the Reform Party&#x27;s nomination.
* On May 17, 2012, Americans Elect announced that it would not run a candidate in the 2012 presidential elections.
* On May 31, 2012, he announced that he was ending his 2012 presidential campaign altogether, citing the lack of ballot access in any of the 50 states to be the reason.

Though he had talked of leaving the Republican Party to become an Independent after his presidential bid failed, the Louisiana secretary of state&#x27;s office reports as of October 24, 2013, and again on February 1, 2016, that Roemer remained a registered Republican in East Baton Rouge Parish.

==Personal life and death==
Roemer was married three times, with his first two marriages ending in divorce. He had three children: daughter Caroline, and sons Chas and Dakota.

Roemer had a stroke in 2014, which affected his speech. He also had type 1 diabetes. He died at his home in Baton Rouge on May 17, 2021, at age 77.

<text>Gordon M. Bethune (born August 29, 1941) is a retired US airline executive. He was the CEO of Continental Airlines from 1994 until his retirement at the end of 2004. He was on the boards of Honeywell and Prudential Financial.
Bethune was known for ensuring that he received some time as a pilot when taking delivery of a new Continental Airlines Boeing 767 from Boeing and repositioning it from Seattle to Houston.

==Early life and US Navy service==
Bethune was born in San Antonio, Texas to Pearl Elley and Jack Bethune, who was serving in the U.S. Army at that time. Bethune grew up in Austin, Texas and spent summers with his father, who owned an aerial crop dusting company in Hernando, Mississippi. Bethune joined the U.S. Navy in 1958 at age 17, becoming an aviation electronics technician. In January 1960, he was serving in Heavy Attack Squadron 11 aboard the USS &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;. He rose to the rank of chief petty officer, chief warrant officer, and over time received his commission as a lieutenant. In 1978, he retired with twin bars of a full lieutenant. His last duty station was with Patrol Squadron Nineteen (Big Red) stationed at Moffett Field, CA. Bethune holds a commercial pilot certificate with type ratings in the Douglas DC-3, Boeing 757, and Boeing 767.

==Early career==
In 1978, a Navy friend asked whether Bethune would consider joining Braniff International Airways as a maintenance manager. He agreed and later became the vice president of maintenance. Bethune later was vice president of engineering and maintenance for Western Airlines. He spent thirteen months with Western before leaving to become senior vice president of operations at Piedmont Airlines. Bethune was vice president and general manager of The Boeing Company&#x27;s Customer Services Division and later the Renton Division where he was responsible for the production of the B737 and B757 airplanes.

Bethune earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Abilene Christian University in 1984.

==Continental Airlines==
Bethune was hired as COO and president of Continental Airlines in 1994 after the airline had twice faced bankruptcy. Bethune later became the airline&#x27;s CEO in November 1994 and was elected chairman of the board of directors in 1996.

BusinessWeek magazine named Bethune one of the Top 25 Global Managers in 1996 and 1997. Under his leadership Continental&#x27;s stock price rose from $2 to over $50 per share. Fortune magazine named Continental among the 100 Best Companies to Work for in America for six consecutive years. In his final year with the airline, Fortune ranked Continental as 2004&#x27;s No. 1 Most Admired Global Airline, a title it earned again in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Bethune released his book, &quot;From Worst to First: Behind the Scenes of Continental&#x27;s Remarkable Comeback&quot;, in 1999 detailing his time at that carrier.

Following his career with Continental, Bethune became the non-executive chairman for the former Aloha Airlines. He was on the board of directors of Prudential Financial, Honeywell, Sprint Corp, and Park Hotels and Resorts. He was a contributor to CNBC following his retirement.

==Awards and honors==
In 1999, Bethune was the National Honorary Initiate of Delta Sigma Pi at the Grand Chapter Congress in Houston. In 2003, he received the &quot;Tony Jannus Award&quot; for outstanding leadership in the Commercial Aviation industry. In 2006, he was awarded the Lloyd P. Nolen Lifetime Achievement in Aviation Award by the Wings over Houston Airshow.

Additionally, he was recognized as one of the Top 25 Global Managers, BusinessWeek, 1996; Laureate in Aviation Trophy, National Air and Space Museum, 1997; 25 Most Influential Executives, Business Travel News, 1998, 2000; 50 Best CEOs in America, Worth, 2001, 2002, 2003; Airline Person of the Year, Travel Agent, 2001.

The Wings Club New York City awarded him the Distinguished Achievement award in 2004. The Navy League of New York presented him The Life Time Achievement Award in 2014. Bethune received the 2009 Philip J. Klass Award for Lifetime Achievement from Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology. The award stated: &quot;...Bethune has spent a lifetime relentlessly searching for ways to make things work better ... has few rivals ... in both his achievements and his popularity with employees.&quot;

<doc id="556521" wikidata="Q582904" url="?curid=556521" title="Marasmus">
<text>Marasmus is a form of severe malnutrition characterized by energy deficiency. It can occur in anyone with severe malnutrition but usually occurs in children. Body weight is reduced to less than 62% of the normal (expected) body weight for the age. Marasmus occurrence increases before age 1, whereas kwashiorkor occurrence increases after 18 months. It can be distinguished from kwashiorkor in that kwashiorkor is protein deficiency with adequate energy intake whereas marasmus has inadequate energy intake in all forms, including protein. This clear-cut separation of marasmus and kwashiorkor is however not always clinically evident as kwashiorkor is often seen in a context of insufficient caloric intake, and mixed clinical pictures, called marasmic kwashiorkor, are possible. Protein wasting in kwashiorkor generally leads to edema and ascites, while muscular wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat are the main clinical signs of marasmus, which makes the ribs and joints protrude.

The prognosis is better than it is for Kwashiorkor. Marasmus is the form of malnutrition most highly associated with HIV, developing in the last stages of pediatric AIDS, and the prognosis for children with co-morbid marasmus and HIV is very poor.

The word &quot;marasmus&quot; comes from the Greek μαρασμός &quot;marasmos&quot; (&quot;withering&quot;).

==Signs and symptoms==
Marasmus is commonly represented by a shrunken, wasted appearance, loss of muscle mass, and subcutaneous fat mass in adult survivors, due to a deficiency in macronutrients and caloric intake (specifically protein) that impact development. Other long term effects of marasmus are the increased risks for pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction which leads to glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes. This may lead to reduced muscle mass, and increased visceral fat. Moreover, there are metabolic implications including reduced insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose metabolism. There is also an increased risk of other NCDs (Non-communicable diseases) as well as CVRFs (Cardiovascular risk factors). Not only are the survivors of marasmus impacted, but their offspring as well. There is an association with survivors and their offspring having a low birth weight. There are also long term effects related to gene methylation. Marasmus adult survivors may have changes in gene expression regarding immunity, growth, and glucose metabolism.

==Diagnosis==
The first steps in the diagnosis of marasmus are through physical examination and anthropometric calculations. Some of the features that are diagnosable in a physical exam are severe wasting and stunting, appearing abnormally thin. Wasting is calculated by measuring weight for height. If the child is 2 standard deviations from the WHO standard, they are considered wasted. Stunting is calculated the same way, however, it is based on height for age ratios. Measurements are also taken via the middle-upper arm circumference (MUAC). After physical examination and measurements, blood tests can be done to determine protein deficiency as well as deficiencies in other major minerals and vitamins. This helps determine the nutritional status and if there are any indicators of marasmus. In extreme cases of infection, stool samples and blood counts are conducted. Since marasmus is a type of nutritional condition that is often associated with kwashiorkor, some providers will see if edema is present to confirm that it is marasmus. Presence of edema is associated with kwashiorkor, not marasmus.

==Causes==

Marasmus is caused by the following factors:
* Maternal malnutrition
* Maternal anemia
* Poverty
* Pathological conditions in a baby (e.g., diarrhea)
* Pneumonia
* Cyanotic heart diseases
* Malaria
* Necrotizing enterocolitis
* Pyloric stenosis
* Lactose intolerance
* Intussusception
* Meningitis
* Anorexia nervosa

==Treatment==
Both the causes and complications of the disorder must be treated, including infections, dehydration, and circulation disorders, which are frequently lethal and lead to high mortality if ignored. Initially, the child is fed dried skim milk that has been mixed with boiled water. Refeeding must be done slowly to avoid refeeding syndrome. Once children start to recover, they should have more balanced diets that meet their nutritional needs. Children with marasmus commonly develop infections and are consequently treated with antibiotics or other medications. Ultimately, marasmus can progress to the point of no return when the body&#x27;s ability for protein synthesis is lost. At this point, attempts to correct the disorder by giving food or protein become futile, and death is inevitable.

== Prevention ==
Nutritionally the best way to prevent marasmus is through a diverse and adequate diet. Other interventions that also target nutrition-specific interventions are SAM treatment, CTC (comprehensive treatment center), and protein and micronutrient supplements. It is also important for mothers and families to be educated on prenatal care, nutrition, and child development. Energy, protein, and micronutrient supplementation are vital to ensuring the mother and child are adequately nourished. Strictly breastfeeding for 6 months and 24 months for nutritional supplementation is also recommended to prevent Marasmus and other malnutrition of children under the age of 2.

In addition to nutrition, ensuring access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene are important in preventing childhood illness and diarrheal disease which can contribute to marasmus and other Severe acute malnutrition cases. If the child has marasmus, it can quickly become dangerous if the child has another disease since the immune system&#x27;s functioning decreases when a child has marasmus. It is important for the child or anyone at risk for marasmus to have access to primary care so they can treat these illnesses, prevent diarrheal diseases often associated with malnutrition and monitor growth.

==Epidemiology==

===United States===

In the United States, marasmus is rarely seen, especially in children. In 1995, there were only 228 deaths caused by marasmus in the U.S., of which only 3 were children. In 2016, the prevalence of marasmus in the United States was 0.5%. Prevalence is higher in hospitalized children, especially ones with chronic illnesses, however, the exact incidence of nonfatal marasmus is not known. This is due to marasmus not being reported as an admission or discharge diagnosis.

===Outside the USA===
There are multiple forms of malnutrition and roughly one-third of the world&#x27;s population is currently experiencing one or more of them. There are around 50 million children less than five years old who have protein-energy malnutrition. Of the malnourished children population in the world, 80% live in Asia, 15% in Africa, and 5% in Latin America. It is estimated that the prevalence of acute malnutrition in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States is 6.1–14%. In Turkey, the prevalence is as high as 32%.

===Race===
There is no evident racial predisposition that correlates to malnutrition. Rather, there is a strong association with the geographic distribution of poverty.

===Age===
Marasmus is more commonly seen in children under the age of five due to that age range being characterized as one that has an increase in energy need and susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections. The World Health Organization also identifies the elderly as another population that is vulnerable to malnutrition. Because their nutritional requirement is not well defined, attempts to provide them with the necessary nutrition becomes difficult.

There exist screening tools and tests that can be used to help identify signs and symptoms of malnutrition in older adults. The Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) is a validated malnutrition screening tool that is primarily used in the residential aged care facility or for adults in the inpatient/outpatient hospital setting. It includes parameters such as weight loss and appetite.
Persons in prisons, concentration camps, and refugee camps are affected more often due to poor nutrition.

== Socioeconomic implications ==
Those who are in poverty are more likely to develop marasmus and other nutritional deficiencies. Due to childhood malnutrition, survivors of marasmus often have poorer socioeconomic prospects due to cognitive compromise in their developmental years. Since adequate nutrition is vital for development, those with Marasmus are impacted by impaired neurodevelopment. This results in a loss of education in the early school years, leading to limited higher educational and occupational opportunities. Prevention may look like improving nutritional education and access, as well as eliminating poverty are ways to reduce the risks of developing these deficiencies.

<text>Roberts Scott Blossom (March 25, 1924July 8, 2011) was an American poet and character actor of theatre, film, and television. He is best known for his roles as Old Man Marley in &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990) and as Ezra Cobb in the horror film &quot;Deranged&quot; (1974). He is also remembered for his supporting roles in films such as &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974), &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977), &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot; (1979), &quot;Christine&quot; (1983), and &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988).

==Early life==
Roberts Scott Blossom was born on March 25, 1924, in New Haven, Connecticut, to John Blossom, an athletic director at Yale University. He was raised in Cleveland, but later moved to Shaker Heights, Ohio. He attended Hawken School and graduated from Asheville School in 1941 and attended Harvard University for a year until he joined the United States Army and served in World War II in Europe. He trained as a therapist and later decided to be an actor. He began directing and acting in productions at Karamu House and the Candlelight Theater in Cleveland and later moved to New York City, where he supported himself by bundling feathers for hats, and practicing Dianetics. He also waited tables until he became a full-time actor.

==Career==
Blossom began acting on stage during the 1950s. He won three Obie Awards for his performances in the off-Broadway plays &quot;Village Wooing&quot; (1955), which was his debut, &quot;Do Not Pass Go&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Ice Age&quot; (1976). During the 1960s, he formed Filmstage, a multimedia &quot;avant garde&quot; theatrical troupe. His Broadway credits include &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe&quot; and &quot;Operation Sidewinder&quot; and in 1988 he appeared in Peter Brook&#x27;s production of &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;.

Blossom began appearing on screen in 1958. His first appearance in a feature film was in 1971&#x27;s &quot;The Hospital&quot; starring George C. Scott and written by Paddy Chayefsky. During the 1970s he had roles in films including &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974) starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1972), Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977), and &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot; (1979) starring Clint Eastwood. &quot;Escape from Alcatraz&quot; is perhaps Blossom&#x27;s best known supporting role for the scene where he chopped off his fingers with an axe.

Blossom is remembered for his role as Ezra Cobb in the 1974 horror film &quot;Deranged&quot; based on American murderer Ed Gein. According to the 2014 book &quot;Mad as Hell: The Making of Network and the Fateful Vision of the Angriest Man in Movies&quot; by David Itzkoff, the cast of Chayefsky&#x27;s multiple Oscar-winning film &quot;Network&quot; originally included Blossom as media mogul Arthur Jensen, but he was replaced in pre-production by Ned Beatty.

Blossom is also known for starring in the 1983 horror film &quot;Christine&quot;, a film directed by John Carpenter which is an adaptation of the book by Stephen King. He is best known for his role in the 1990 film &quot;Home Alone&quot;, in which he played Old Man Marley alongside Macaulay Culkin. He appeared in his final film role in 1995 alongside Sharon Stone and Leonardo DiCaprio in &quot;The Quick and The Dead&quot; (1995). Blossom&#x27;s other film credits include &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot; (1991) starring Michael J. Fox; &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; (1983); &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1980) starring Ellen Burstyn; &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (1984); &quot;Vision Quest&quot; (1985) starring Matthew Modine and Linda Fiorentino; and &quot;Always&quot; (1989).

Blossom made his first television appearance in 1958 in the television series &quot;Naked City&quot;. From 1976 to 1978, he starred on the television soap opera &quot;Another World&quot;, for which he won a Soapy Award for Best Villain. His other television credits include &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, with Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis, &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;, &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, the revived 1980s version of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;. His television films including &quot;Family Reunion&quot;, with Bette Davis, the 1985 version of &quot;Noon Wine&quot;, &quot;Murder in the Heartland&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;Balloon Farm&quot;, which was his final role as an actor.

In 2000, Blossom appeared in the biography documentary &quot;Full Blossom: The Life of Poet/Actor Roberts Blossom&quot;, in which he talked about his life as an actor and poet. The documentary also featured his children Debbie and Michael, his first wife Beverly, and Ed Asner, Peter Brook and Robert Frank.

==Personal life==
Blossom was formerly married to Beverly Schmidt Blossom, with whom he had a son, Michael. She died on November 1, 2014, of cancer. He was later married to Marylin Orshan Blossom until her death in 1982, with whom he had a daughter, Deborah Blossom.

After Blossom retired from acting in the late 1990s, he moved to Berkeley, California, and spent his time writing poetry. He later moved to Santa Monica, where he died in 2011.

<text>Joshua Brewster Bolten (born August 16, 1954) is an American lawyer and politician. Bolten served as the White House chief of staff to U.S. president George W. Bush, replacing Andrew Card on April 14, 2006. Previously, he served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget from 2003 to 2006. 

Since 2017, he has been president and CEO of the Business Roundtable.

==Early life and education==
Bolten is Jewish, the son of Analouise (née Clissold) and Seymour Bolten. His father worked for the CIA and his mother taught world history at George Washington University. He graduated from St. Albans School, and served on the school&#x27;s board until 2007.

Bolten attended Princeton University, where he studied in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and served as class president and president of The Ivy Club. He graduated in 1976. Bolten completed a 152-page long senior thesis titled &quot;Judicial Selection in Virginia.&quot; He graduated with a J.D. from Stanford Law School in 1980 and served as an editor of the law review.

<text>Gata Kamsky (; ; born June 2, 1974) is a Soviet-born American chess grandmaster, and a five-time U.S. champion.

Kamsky reached the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship 1996 at the age of 22, and reached a ranking of fourth in the world rankings in 1995. He played almost no FIDE-rated games between 1997 and late 2004.

Kamsky won the Chess World Cup 2007. This earned him a Candidates Match against Veselin Topalov, which he lost. Kamsky also competed in the Candidates Tournament in 2011, losing to Boris Gelfand.

==Early career==
Kamsky was born in Novokuznetsk in Russia, in a Tatar family. Gata&#x27;s last name, Kamsky, is derived from the stage nickname of his grandfather Gataullah &quot;Kamsky&quot; Sabirov, the founder of the Tatar Drama Theater in Kazan.

At age 12, he defeated veteran Grandmaster Mark Taimanov in a tournament game. He also earned his National Master title in that year. He won the Soviet under-20 championship in 1987 and 1988.

In 1989, he moved to the United States with his father Röstäm (also spelled Rustam), a former boxer who dominated Gata, made him study chess almost exclusively, and acted as his coach and manager. Allen Kaufman, then Executive Director of the American Chess Foundation, helped arrange for their support after their move. Businessman James Cayne provided financial support to the Kamskys.

In 1989, Gata Kamsky won a tournament in New York to earn the right to challenge Garry Kasparov to a two-game match; he lost that match later that year 0–2. In 1990, while aged 16 and still untitled, he played in the 64-player Interzonal tournament in Manila, the first step toward the World Chess Championship. He finished with 5½ / 13.

In 1990, FIDE awarded Kamsky the grandmaster title. In 1991, he won the U.S. Championship. Kamsky also did well at other prestigious chess tournaments, winning the Las Palmas tournament in 1994.

==World Championship Candidate (1993–96)==
In 1993, the rival organisations FIDE and PCA each held Interzonal tournaments. Kamsky played in both, and in both cases qualified for the respective Candidates Tournaments. The Candidates tournaments were largely dominated by Kamsky and Viswanathan Anand.

In the first round of the 1994–95 FIDE Candidates matches, Kamsky beat Paul van der Sterren (+3=3−1). Kamsky&#x27;s second round (Candidates semifinal) match against Anand, held in July and August 1994 in Sanghi Nagar, India, was more dramatic. After draws in the first two games, Anand won the next two games to take an imposing 3–1 lead. Game 5 was drawn. Kamsky then scored 2½–½ in the remaining three games to tie the match 4–4 (+2=4−2), then won the two rapid chess playoff games to win the match. In the third round (Candidates final), held in Sanghi Nagar in February 1995, Kamsky routed Valery Salov 5½–1½ (+4=3−0).

In the 1994–95 PCA Candidates matches, Kamsky beat Vladimir Kramnik in the quarter-finals in New York in June, 1994. In September, 1994 Kamsky beat Nigel Short in the semifinals in Linares, Spain. In the March 1995 final against Anand in Las Palmas, the FIDE result was reversed, with Kamsky losing (+1=7−3).

In the September 1994 match against Short, there was a highly publicized confrontation between Kamsky&#x27;s father, Rustam Kamsky, and Short.

In 1996, Kamsky played a 20-game match against Anatoly Karpov for the FIDE World Chess Championship 1996 title at Elista in Kalmykia, losing 7½–10½ (+3=9−6).

==Inactivity (1996–2004)==
After losing the match to Karpov, Kamsky gave up professional chess. He graduated from Brooklyn College with a B.A. in 1999. He then attended and graduated from law school at Touro Law Center in New York.

Kamsky&#x27;s next rated games after his loss to Karpov were in 1999, when he returned to play in the FIDE Knockout World Championship event in Las Vegas, where he played a first-round, two-game match against the eventual tournament winner, Alexander Khalifman. Kamsky won the first game, lost the second game, and then lost the rapid play-off games.

==Comeback (2004 onward)==

Kamsky retired from the world of chess for eight years, except for a two-game match in 1999. The first sighting of Kamsky after that came in March 2004 when ChessBase reported that Sam Sloan had spoken to him.

Kamsky did not play another game in public until June 15, 2004, when he participated in the 106th New York Masters, playing four games in a day with a time control of 30 minutes for all his moves. His two wins and two draws were enough for him to tie for first place with four others. He subsequently played in several other editions of the weekly event with mixed success, before returning to regular chess in the 2005 U.S. Championship held in November–December 2004 where he scored a respectable but unspectacular 5½–3½. He was rated number 19 in the world on the April 2005 FIDE Elo rating list, at 2700. He retained this rating on the July 2005 list, but moved up to number 18, after a good unbeaten result at the 2005 HB Global Challenge tournament, held in Minneapolis in May, 2005.

He has since returned to international chess, most notably finishing second behind Veselin Topalov at the M-Tel Masters event. Soon after, Kamsky led the US team to the bronze medal at the 2006 Chess Olympiad in Turin. On July 4, 2006, he tied for first place with nine others at the Philadelphia World Open, then won the play-off, winning about $7,000. A number of successes in 2007 marked his return to the playing level he had before his retirement, hinting at the possibility of becoming again a challenger for the very top of the world&#x27;s chess hierarchy.

Kamsky played in the FIDE Chess World Cup 2005, and qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the World Chess Championship 2007, in May–June 2007. He won his first round match against Étienne Bacrot (+3−0=1), but was eliminated when he lost his second round match to Boris Gelfand +0−2=3.

In November–December 2007, Kamsky participated in the Chess World Cup 2007. Seeded 11th, he won his first three rounds and then defeated Peter Svidler, former FIDE world champion Ruslan Ponomariov and future world number-one Magnus Carlsen to reach the finals. In the final he defeated Alexei Shirov (+1−0=3) to win the title, shocking many in the chess world.

Kamsky&#x27;s victory earned him a match against world number-one Veselin Topalov in 2009 for the right to challenge for the World Chess Championship 2010 against world champion Viswanathan Anand. The match was held in Sofia, Bulgaria, in February 2009. Although Kamsky won game four to level the match 2–2, Topalov scored +2 in the final 3 games (including an exciting last round victory on the White side of the French Defense) to win the match 4½–2½.

Kamsky played board one for the United States in the 2008 Chess Olympiad, held in Dresden, Germany in November. The U.S. team captured the bronze medals.

Kamsky participated in the Chess World Cup 2009 but was upset in the third round by Wesley So.

In January 2010 Kamsky won the 52nd Reggio Emilia chess tournament (he came equal first with Zoltán Almási, defeating him in the last round, but had a better Buchholz tiebreak). In May 2010 he tied for 1st–3rd with Vladimir Kramnik and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in the President&#x27;s Cup in Baku.

He became U.S. Champion on May 25, 2010, after winning a rapid playoff game with second-place finisher Yury Shulman. This championship, Kamsky&#x27;s second, came 19 years after he won his first U.S. championship.

In August 2010, Kamsky won clear first at the Open Grenke Rapid World Championship (Mainz Chess Classic), a Rapid Chess tournament, with 10/11, defeating world No. 5 and defending champion Levon Aronian, 2004 FIDE champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov, and Sergey Karjakin en route to the title ahead of Grischuk, Shirov and several other strong Grandmasters.

From August 23 through August 31, Kamsky participated in the Baku Open in Azerbaijan, where he was the top seed. He won his final three games to clinch clear first with 7½/9.

From April 13 through April 18, 2011, Kamsky participated in the United States Championship, where he was the top seed. He won the tournament for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player since Lev Alburt in 1985 to win consecutive U.S. Championships; the title was his third career United States Championship.

As a finalist of the 2010 world championship cycle, Kamsky was given direct entry to the eight player Candidates Tournament to determine the challenger for the World Chess Championship 2012. The candidates tournament began with best-of-four game match format in May 2011 in Kazan, with Kamsky facing Veselin Topalov in the quarterfinals. With a win on the Black side of the Gruenfeld defense in the second game, Kamsky held on to defeat the top-seeded Topalov 2½–1½ to advance to the semifinals. In the semifinals, he faced the 2009 Chess World Cup champion Boris Gelfand in a rematch of their 2007 Candidates tournament meeting won by Gelfand. After four games, the match was tied at 2–2, with rapid tiebreaks to decide the winner on May 16. In the rapid tiebreaks, Kamsky won game 3 with black to take a 2–1 lead and needed only a draw with white in the final rapid game to advance to the final. However, Gelfand won with black to force a blitz playoff, which he won 2–0 to eliminate Kamsky and reach the Candidates final.

In May 2012, Kamsky participated in the 2012 U.S. Championship, where he was seeded second behind defending champion Hikaru Nakamura. He scored 5/7 to qualify for the round-robin stage against Nakamura, 2006 champion Alexander Onischuk, and 2008 champion Yuri Shulman. In the round-robin stage, he drew Nakamura with black and then defeated Onischuk on the White side of the Ruy Lopez. In 2013 and 2014 he won the tournament, and the last title was his fifth career United States Championship. In 2016 he placed third at the Chigorin Memorial tournament in Saint Petersburg.

<text>Capitol Hill is a densely populated residential district and a neighborhood in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is immediately east of Downtown Seattle and north of First Hill. The neighborhood is one of the city&#x27;s most popular nightlife and entertainment districts and is home to a historic gay village and vibrant counterculture community.

==History==
In the early 1900s Capitol Hill was known as &#x27;Broadway Hill&#x27; after the neighborhood&#x27;s main thoroughfare. The origin of its current name is disputed. James A. Moore, the real estate developer who platted much of the area, reportedly gave it the name in the hope that the Washington State Capitol would move to Seattle from Olympia. Another story claims that Moore named it after the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Denver, Colorado, his wife&#x27;s hometown. According to author Jacqueline Williams, both stories are likely true. The neighborhood was frequently referred to as Catholic Hill up until the 1980s due to its large Catholic population.
Capitol Hill is home to some of Seattle&#x27;s wealthiest neighborhoods, including &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot; along 14th Avenue E. south of Volunteer Park (family residences on tree-lined streets) and the Harvard-Belmont Landmark District. The neighborhood is home to many distinguished apartment houses, including several by Fred Anhalt, as well as a few surviving Classical Revival complexes such as the Blackstone Apartments. The neighborhood&#x27;s architecture did not fare so well in the post-World War II period; architect Victor Steinbrueck wrote in 1962 of the &quot;tremendous growth of less-than-luxury apartments&quot; that at first &quot;appear to be consistent with the clean, direct approach associated with contemporary architecture&quot; but whose &quot;open outdoor corridors&quot; totally defeat their &quot;large &#x27;view&#x27; windows&quot; by giving occupants no privacy if they leave their blinds open to enjoy the view. He added, &quot;most tenants close their blinds and look for another apartment when their lease runs out.&quot;

During the George Floyd protests of 2020, Cal Anderson Park and surrounding blocks along Pike and Pine Streets near the SPD East Precinct were occupied by protesters and declared the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ).

==Geography==
Capitol Hill is situated on a steep hill just east of the city&#x27;s downtown central business district. It is bounded by Interstate 5 (I-5) to the west (beyond which are Downtown, Cascade, and Eastlake); to the north by State Route 520 and Interlaken Park (beyond which are Portage Bay and Montlake); to the south by E. Pike and E. Madison Streets (beyond which are First Hill and the Central District); and to the east by 23rd and 24th Avenues E. (beyond which is Madison Valley).

Capitol Hill&#x27;s main thoroughfare is Broadway, the commercial heart of the district. Other major streets in the area are 10th, 12th, 15th, and 19th Avenues, all running north–south, and E. Pine, E. Pike, E. John, E. Thomas, and E. Aloha Streets and E. Olive Way, running east–west. Of these streets, large portions of E. Pike Street, E. Pine Street, Broadway, 15th Avenue, and E. Olive Way are lined almost continuously with street-level retail. The Pike-Pine corridor (the area between Pike and Pine streets) from Boren Avenue through 15th Street is another main thoroughfare in Capitol Hill, full of coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and other food and music businesses. The neighborhood is largely characterized by mid-rise buildings occupied by an eclectic mix of businesses.

The highest point on Capitol Hill, at above sea level, is in Volunteer Park, adjacent to the water tower. Capitol Hill has several of Seattle&#x27;s steepest street grades, including the steepest paved street at 21% on E. Roy Street between 25th and 26th Avenues E. (eastern slope).

==Transportation==

The Link light rail system&#x27;s Capitol Hill station is served by the 1 Line and opened in March 2016 as part of the University Link extension. The 1 Line connects the neighborhood to the University of Washington campus to the north, and Downtown Seattle to the south. The station is located along Broadway south of John Street and Olive Way.

The First Hill Streetcar line, which opened in January 2016, terminates in the neighborhood on Broadway at Denny Way, just south of the Link light rail station. Capitol Hill was previously served by city-run streetcars until 1940.

Bus transit service to and within Capitol Hill is provided by King County Metro, including routes 10, 12, 43 and 49 of the Seattle trolleybus system. The City of Seattle and King County Metro are under construction on the Rapid Ride G bus line along Madison Street, connecting from downtown Seattle, through First Hill, then Capitol Hill, and beyond to Madison Valley and Madison Park. The bus line will include 6-minute headways during peak times, and center-boarding stations between 9th and 13th avenues.

==Culture==

===Arts and entertainment===

Capitol Hill has a reputation as a bastion of musical culture in Seattle and is the neighborhood most closely associated with the grunge scene from the early 1990s, although most of the best-known music venues of that era were actually located slightly outside the neighborhood. The music scene has transformed since those days and now a variety of genres (electronica, rock, punk, folk, salsa, hip hop and trance) are represented.

The neighborhood figures prominently in nightlife and entertainment, with many bars hosting live music and with numerous fringe theatres. Most of the Hill&#x27;s major thoroughfares are dotted with coffeehouses, taverns and bars, and residences cover the gamut from modest motel-like studio apartment buildings to some of the city&#x27;s most historic mansions, with the two types sometimes shoulder-to-shoulder.

Capitol Hill is also home to two of the city&#x27;s best-known movie theaters, both of which are part of the Landmark Theatres chain. Both theaters are architectural conversions of private meeting halls: the Harvard Exit (now closed permanently) in the former home of the Woman&#x27;s Century Club (converted in the early 1970s) and the Egyptian Theatre, in a former Masonic lodge (converted in the mid-1980s). There is also Seattle&#x27;s only cinematheque, the Northwest Film Forum, which in addition to screening films, teaches classes on filmmaking and produces film alongside Seattle&#x27;s burgeoning filmmaking community. These theaters respectively host showings for the Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF) and the Seattle Lesbian &amp; Gay Film Festival every year. The Broadway Performance Hall, located on the campus of Seattle Central College (SCC), also hosts a variety of lectures, performances, and films. The cast of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Real World Seattle: Bad Blood&quot; lived in and were filmed in Capitol Hill during 2016.

Since 1997, Capitol Hill has hosted the Capitol Hill Block Party annually in late July, an outdoor music festival that occurs on Pike Street between Broadway and 12th Ave and Union and Pine Street.

A &quot;mystery soda machine&quot;, dispensing unusual drink flavors, was present in Capitol Hill from the late 1990s to 2018. Allison Williams of &quot;Seattle Met&quot; noted several years after the machine was removed, that the neighborhood of Capitol Hill now has a more corporate culture and may no longer be &quot;weird enough for a persistent enigma.&quot;

===Coffeehouses===
Besides the large Seattle-based chains—Starbucks, Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee (now owned by Starbucks), and Tully&#x27;s Coffee—Capitol Hill has been home to some of the city&#x27;s most prominent locally owned coffeehouses. David Schomer&#x27;s Espresso Vivace on Broadway is credited as the birthplace of artisanal coffee culture and latte art in Seattle and the United States as a whole. The neighborhood is also considered a test market for coffeehouses by Starbucks Corporation, which placed two stealth Starbucks stores on Capitol Hill in 2009 and 2011 that were later closed by 2019.

===LGBTQ community===

A bourgeoning counterculture community on Capitol Hill in the mid-20th century became a magnet for LGBTQ people seeking community acceptance at a time when the city&#x27;s earlier gay capital in Downtown Seattle&#x27;s (notoriously rowdy) Pioneer Square was in decline. As a result, large-scale gay residential settlement of Capitol Hill began in the early 1960s, and the district continues to be home to a sizable number of LGBTQ people, making Capitol Hill Seattle&#x27;s &quot;gayborhood&quot;.

The roots of the LGBTQ community on Capitol Hill can be traced to a change in the demographics and culture of the city as a whole in the 1950s and 1960s. LGBTQ Seattleites had long congregated in Pioneer Square, often interchangeably termed &quot;Skid Road,&quot; and had built up a community in establishments such as the Double Header, the Casino, and the Garden of Allah (just north of the neighborhood). When the neighborhood, which houses many notable works of Victorian and Edwardian architecture, was targeted for urban renewal (and perhaps even prior), the Seattle Police Department engaged in extortion, allowing illegal homosexual practices and cross-dressing to continue only in bars which paid them off. The payoffs did not always guarantee security, and in 1966, citing alarm over the city&#x27;s widespread image as a bastion of gay culture and tolerance, SPD planned a major house-cleaning of the gay bars in Pioneer Square. The gay community then began to migrate out of Downtown Seattle, which was accelerated by the opening of the Kingdome and redevelopment of the neighborhood for sports-friendly uses in the 1970s.

The rise of American counterculture on the west coast took place during the same period. Although the University District, home to sites such as the Ave, the University of Washington, Parrington Lawn or &quot;Hippie Hill&quot;, the Last Exit On Brooklyn coffeehouse, and the Blue Moon Tavern, was the primary hub of 1960s counterculture in Seattle, Capitol Hill also experienced a very noticeable influx of artistic and bohemian life. Largely driven by low rent from &quot;white flight&quot; in the steadily disappearing &quot;auto row&quot; of Capitol Hill&#x27;s Pike-Pine Corridor neighborhood, LGBTQ Seattleites began to build the foundations of a community of their own deep in the structure of this evolving neighborhood.

After the Elite Tavern, the first gay bar on Broadway, opened in the 1950s, the LGBTQ community on the Hill began to grow parallel to its decline in Pioneer Square. By the late 1960s, Capitol Hill was primed to become the local home base of the gay liberation movement and community throughout the decade following the Stonewall riots of 1969 in New York City.

Capitol Hill was the birthplace of many notable LGBTQ organizations during the first 25 years of the gay rights movement. In July 1969, only a few days after the Stonewall riots, the Dorian Society opened Dorian House in Capitol Hill&#x27;s Hilltop neighborhood, a locale which soon became an important hub of LGBTQ youth outreach. Now called Seattle Counseling Service, it was the first mental health organization in the United States specializing in affirming treatment of ostracized LGBTQ youth. In 1974, the Gay Community Center opened in the Hilltop area. In 1991, Lambert House LGBTQ youth community center, also in the Hilltop, opened its doors and became a model organization for queer youth outreach. After moving from Downtown in 1982, Seattle&#x27;s official gay pride parades took place on Capitol Hill for several decades, and the annual festival continues to hold block parties on the Hill.

The gay and bisexual male community on Capitol Hill was the epicenter of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region. Among the deceased in 1995 was Washington&#x27;s first openly-gay legislator, Cal Anderson, who was the state legislative representative for Capitol Hill and the University District. In remembrance of Anderson&#x27;s legacy, Lincoln Reservoir Park, the main Olmstedian centerpiece to the urban landscape of the Broadway, Pike-Pine, and Hilltop neighborhoods which form the core of Capitol Hill&#x27;s LGBTQ community, was renamed in his honor.

During Pride week of 2015, eleven permanent rainbow crosswalks were painted in the Capitol Hill portion of the Pike-Pine corridor. In 2020, the plaza atop Capitol Hill light rail station adjacent to Cal Anderson Park became home to the AIDS Memorial Pathway, a permanent outdoor public art gallery commemorating victims of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 2019, the block of E Denny Way at the light rail station that connects Broadway to Cal Anderson Park was renamed E Barbara Bailey Way, after a notable small business owner and LGBTQ rights activist.

In 1993, the oldest gay bar on Broadway, the Elite Tavern, was bombed by neo-Nazis. Capitol Hill has become the target of an increasing number of anti-LGBTQ hate crimes in the early 21st century. The increased gentrification of the neighborhood by the end of the 20th century led to an outward migration of the LGBTQ community to other areas of the city and surrounding metropolitan area. From 2000 to 2012, the share of same-sex couple households on Capitol Hill declined by 23 percent, while it increased by 52 percent citywide. From 2010 to 2015, 89 new buildings were built on Capitol Hill and 4,600 residential units were added—primarily catering towards high-income tech industry workers.

==Landmarks and institutions==
Registered Historic Places on Capitol Hill include the Harvard-Belmont Landmark District, in which is located the original building of the Cornish College of the Arts; Volunteer Park, in which are the Seattle Asian Art Museum and Volunteer Park Conservatory; and The Northwest School. 

In addition to Volunteer Park, parks on Capitol Hill include Cal Anderson Park, Louisa Boren Park, Interlaken Park, Roanoke Park, Pendleton Miller Park, and Thomas Street Park. Lake View Cemetery, containing the graves of Bruce Lee and his son Brandon Lee, lies directly north of Volunteer Park, and the Grand Army of the Republic Cemetery is further north.

Also on the Hill are The Northwest School, Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences, St. Joseph School, Holy Names Academy, Seattle Hebrew Academy, Seattle Preparatory School, Seattle University, Seattle Central Community College, and St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Cathedral. Additionally, Seattle University is located south of Madison Street, and is considered to be either in Capitol Hill or First Hill.

The oldest African-American church in Seattle is located on 14th Avenue, between E Pike and E Pine streets. The First African Methodist Episcopal Church was originally incorporated in 1891 as the Jones Street Church (when 14th Avenue was called Jones Street). The church was constructed in 1912, replacing the large house where congregations previously met, on the same site. The church structure was designated as a Seattle landmark in 1984.

The First Methodist Protestant Church of Seattle, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was remodeled and is now occupied by a design and marketing firm.

There is one Jewish synagogue near Capitol Hill. Temple De Hirsch Sinai, whose Alhadeff Sanctuary was designed by B. Marcus Priteca, among others, is just south of Madison Street, placing it technically in the Central District.

In 2021, St Patrick&#x27;s church on East Edgar Street was named as one of three Catholic churches facing closure in a reorganization plan by the Archdiocese of Seattle.

==Film==
Bush&#x27;s film work includes appearances in &quot;The Savage Seven&quot; (1968), &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; (1970), &quot;Monte Walsh&quot; (1970), &quot;The Jesus Trip&quot; (1971), &quot;The Organization&quot; (1971), &quot;Welcome Home, Soldier Boys&quot; (1972), &quot;The Culpepper Cattle Co.&quot; (1972), &quot;40 Carats&quot; (1973), &quot;Electra Glide in Blue&quot; (1973) where his performance caused some critics to characterize his screen persona as &quot;irrepressibly unique&quot;; &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1974), &quot;Mackintosh and T.J.&quot; (1975), &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; (1976), &quot;The Beasts Are on the Streets&quot; (1978), &quot;The Jericho Mile&quot; (1979), &quot;Tom Horn&quot; (1980), &quot;The River&quot; (1984), &quot;The Hitcher&quot; (1986), &quot;Critters&quot; (1986), &quot;Rampage&quot; (1987) and &quot;Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday&quot; (1993).

==Television==
Bush has appeared frequently on television, including a recurring role as Bobby Angel on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; and an episode of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, in which his character, “Cowboy”, tries to kill commanding officer Henry Blake.

He twice portrayed Vernon Presley, the father of Elvis Presley, first in the 1988 TV movie &quot;Elvis and Me&quot;, which was based on the 1985 memoir of the same name by Presley&#x27;s ex-wife Priscilla, and then in the short-lived weekly series &quot;Elvis&quot; in 1990.

<doc id="556539" wikidata="Q137634" url="?curid=556539" title="Jackie Burroughs">
<text>Jacqueline Burroughs (2 February 1939 – 22 September 2010) was a British-born Canadian actress. Burroughs starred in over 100 films and television shows over her career, including &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;, &quot;The Grey Fox&quot;, and &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, and was best known for her role as Hetty King in the TV series &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Southport, Lancashire (now Merseyside), England, on 2 February 1939, Burroughs emigrated to Canada with her family in 1951. She attended the University of Toronto before moving to New York City.

== Career ==
After returning to Canada, Burroughs started acting in live theatre at Ontario&#x27;s Stratford Festival and Shaw Festival, including starring as Portia in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; in 1976. Burroughs won the 1969 Canadian Film Award for best actress, for starring in the television film &quot;Dulcima&quot;. Burroughs acted in over 100 films and television programs, including a voice-over stint in the animated anthology &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (1981), appearances in &quot;The Grey Fox&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; (1983). Burroughs played the voice of The Spirit in 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Care Bears Movie&quot;.

In 1987, Burroughs produced, directed, co-wrote, and starred in &quot;A Winter Tan&quot;, a film based on the letters of Maryse Holder, published in 1979 as the book &quot;Give Sorrow Words – Maryse Holder&#x27;s Letters from Mexico&quot;, later receiving a Genie Award for best performance by an actress in a leading role for the film. She played role of Mrs. Amelia Evans in &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; (1985). She was perhaps best known for her portrayal of the fictional character, Hetty King, in the CBC Television series &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; from 1990 to 1996. The series was based on the works of Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery. She also played Mother Mucca in the television adaptations of Armistead Maupin&#x27;s &quot;More Tales of the City&quot; and &quot;Further Tales of the City&quot;. Burroughs again played a mother role in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Willard&quot;.

In 2001, she was awarded the Earle Grey Award for her contributions to arts and entertainment over the years by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television. In 2005, Burroughs received a Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada&#x27;s highest honour in the performing arts. Over her career, Burroughs was nominated ten times and won seven, including four Gemini Awards and two Canadian Film Awards. Burroughs also won three Genie Awards.

==Personal life==
Burroughs was married to Zalman Yanovsky, co-founder (with John Sebastian) of The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful; they separated in 1968. They had one daughter.

==Death==
Burroughs died at her home in Toronto on 22 September 2010, aged 71, after suffering from stomach cancer.

<text>USS &quot;San Francisco&quot; (CL/CA-38), a , was the second ship of three of the United States Navy named after the city of San Francisco, California. Commissioned in 1934, she was one of the most decorated ships of World War II, earning 17 battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation.

Like most of her sister ships, she saw extensive action during the Guadalcanal campaign, including the Battle of Cape Esperance and the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, during which she was heavily damaged and her captain and admiral killed. Earlier in the battle she mistakenly fired on the light cruiser , causing serious damage and inflicting numerous casualties.

Decommissioned immediately after the end of the war, she was sold for scrap in 1959.

Her bridge wings, damaged during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and removed during repairs, are now mounted on a promontory in Golden Gate National Recreation Area. They are set on the great circle course from San Francisco to Guadalcanal.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;San Francisco&quot; was laid down on 9 September 1931 at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, under the supervision of Naval constructor Charles W. Fisher Jr.; launched on 9 March 1933; sponsored by Miss Barbara M. Bailly; and commissioned on 10 February 1934, Captain Royal E. Ingersoll in command.

The &quot;New Orleans&quot;-class cruisers were the last U.S. cruisers built to the specifications and standards of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Such ships, with a limit of 10,000 tons standard displacement and 8-inch caliber main guns, may be referred to as &quot;treaty cruisers.&quot; Originally classified as a light cruiser before she was laid down due to her thin armor, she was reclassified as a heavy cruiser because of her 8-inch guns. The term &quot;heavy cruiser&quot; was not defined until the London Naval Treaty in 1930.

==Inter-war period==
After an extensive shakedown cruise – which included operations off Mexico, in Hawaiian waters, off Washington and British Columbia, and a voyage to the Panama Canal Zone – the cruiser returned to the Mare Island Navy Yard. Gunnery installation and conversion to a flagship took her into 1935. In February, she joined Cruiser Division 6 (Crudiv 6) at San Diego. In May, she moved north and participated in Fleet Problem XVI, then returned to southern California. A few weeks later, she was back off the northwest coast for fleet tactics, and in July, she steamed farther north to Alaska. In August, she returned to California and, through the end of 1938, San Francisco continued to range the eastern Pacific, cruising from the state of Washington to Peru and from California to Hawaii.

In January 1939, she departed the west coast to participate in Fleet Problem XX, conducted in the Atlantic east of the Lesser Antilles. In March, she became flagship of CruDiv 7 and commenced a goodwill tour of South American ports. Departing Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in early April, she called at ports on the east coast of that continent, moved through the Strait of Magellan and visited west coast ports, then in early June, transited the Panama Canal to complete her voyage around the continent.

==World War II==
On 1 September 1939, World War II started, and on 14 September, &quot;San Francisco&quot; moved south from Naval Station Norfolk to join the Neutrality Patrol. The cruiser carried freight and passengers to San Juan, Puerto Rico, thence sailed for a patrol of the West Indies as far south as Trinidad. On 14 October, she completed her patrol back at San Juan and headed for Norfolk, where she remained into January 1940. On 11 January, she headed for Guantanamo Bay, where she was relieved as flagship by , where she returned to the Pacific.

Transiting the Panama Canal in late February, she called at San Pedro and, in March, continued on to her new home port, Pearl Harbor, where she rejoined CruDiv 6. In May 1940, she steamed northwest to the Puget Sound Navy Yard for an overhaul, during which she also received four guns. On 29 September, she returned to Pearl Harbor. In early May 1941, she became flagship of CruDiv 6; and, at the end of July, she moved east for a cruise to Long Beach, California, returning to Hawaii on 27 August. In September, the flag of CruDiv 6 was hauled down; and on 11 October, &quot;San Francisco&quot; entered the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard for an overhaul which was scheduled for completion on 25 December.

===Pearl Harbor attack===
On 7 December 1941, &quot;San Francisco&quot; was in Pearl Harbor awaiting docking and the cleaning of her heavily fouled bottom. Her engineering plant was largely broken down for overhaul. Ammunition for her 5 in (127mm) and 8 in (203mm) guns had been placed in storage. Her guns had been removed to permit installation of four quadruple mounts, although the mounts had not yet been installed. Her machine guns were being overhauled. Only small arms and two machine guns were available. Moreover, a number of &quot;San Francisco&#x27;s&quot; officers and men were absent.

At 0755, Japanese planes began dive-bombing Battleship Row near Ford Island. Off-duty signalman Ed Ifkin was relaxing on the signal bridge.

&quot;I was reading the newspaper I&#x27;d just bought at the kiosk on the wharf, when an airplane buzzed over my head with that big red meatball on its side. I was trained to recognize foreign insignia and knew right away it was Japanese. I telephoned down to the bridge and told the duty officer. He said, &#x27;Ifkin, you&#x27;ll go on report for horsing around,&#x27; when BOOM! The first torpedo hit (USS) &quot;Oklahoma&quot;. Our guns were down, so a bunch of us climbed over to &quot;New Orleans.&quot; It was berthed right next us. We spent the next two hours feeding ammunition to the gunners.

Ifkin is recognized as the first U.S. sailor to report the Japanese attack.

By 0800, the attack on Pearl Harbor was well underway. The men of San Francisco secured the ship for watertightness and began looking for opportunities to fight back. Some, like Ifkin, crossed to to help man anti-aircraft batteries on that ship. Others began using available rifles and machine guns. Ammunition for machine guns was transferred to for use.

&quot;When the Japanese left, the entire harbor was a shambles&quot;, Iftkin recalled. &quot;The fires, the oil in the water from the torpedoed ships . . . the Arizona burned for two days&quot;.

&quot;San Francisco&quot; was undamaged after the attack and work resumed to make her combat-ready.

On 14 December, the cruiser left the yard; the scaling of her keel had been postponed for more urgent repairs to other ships. On 16 December, she sortied with Task Force 14 (TF 14) to relieve Wake Island. The force moved west with a Marine fighter squadron onboard and a Marine battalion embarked in . However, when Wake Island fell to the Japanese on 23 December, TF 14 was diverted to Midway Atoll, which it reinforced. On 29 December, the force returned to Pearl Harbor.

===1942===
On 8 January 1942, &quot;San Francisco&quot; again moved west. In TF 8, she steamed toward Samoa to rendezvous with, and cover the off-loading of, transports carrying reinforcements to Tutuila, Samoa. There, she joined Task Force 17 for raids on Japanese installations in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands. &quot;San Francisco&quot; arrived in the Samoan area on 18 January, and on the 24th was detached to continue coverage for the transports while the remainder of the task force and TF 17 conducted offensive operations to the northwest.

On 8 February, &quot;San Francisco&quot; departed from Tutuila. On the 10th, she rejoined CruDiv 6, then in TF 11, and she set a course for an area northeast of the Solomon Islands to strike Rabaul. However, the American force was sighted and attacked by two waves of Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; medium bombers. Sixteen of the planes were destroyed, but since the element of surprise had been lost, TF 11 retired eastward.

During the next few days, TF 11 – centered around – conducted operations in the South Pacific Area, then headed for New Guinea to participate with TF 17 in a raid against Japanese shipping and installations.

On 7 March, one of &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s scout planes was reported missing and could not be found.

On the night of 9–10 March, TFs 11 and 17 entered the Gulf of Papua, whence, at dawn, &quot;Lexington&quot; and launched their aircraft to cross the Owen Stanley Range and attack the Japanese at Salamaua and Lae.

The next day, the missing plane was sighted by and recovered by &quot;San Francisco&quot;. It had landed on the water, but had been unable to communicate. The pilot, Lieutenant J. A. Thomas, and the radioman, O. J. Gannan, had headed for Australia, sailing the plane backwards as it tended to head into the prevailing east wind. In five days and 21 hours, they had covered approximately 385 miles (715 km) on a course within 5 degrees of that intended.

&quot;San Francisco&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 March. On 22 April, the cruiser departed Oahu for San Francisco in the escort of convoy 4093. At the end of May, she headed west, escorting convoy PW 2076, made up of transports carrying the 37th Army Division, destined for Suva, and special troops bound for Australia. The cruiser remained in the escort force as far as Auckland, New Zealand. There she steamed for Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 29 June.

&quot;San Francisco&quot; steamed west with and to escort convoy 4120 to the Fiji Islands. From there, she got underway to rendezvous with the Solomon Islands Expeditionary Force.

Operation Watchtower – the Guadalcanal-Tulagi offensive – opened on the morning of 7 August. Through that day and the remainder of the month, &quot;San Francisco&quot; helped to cover the American forces in the area. The flag of Rear Admiral Norman Scott, commanding the cruisers attached to TF 18, was shifted to &quot;San Francisco&quot;.

On 3 September, &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s force put into Nouméa, New Caledonia, for fuel and provisions. On 8 September, the ships departed that island to cover reinforcements moving up to Guadalcanal. On the 11th, &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s force, TF 18, rendezvoused with TF 17, the group, and the next day, both groups refueled at sea. On 14 September, the reinforcement convoy departed the New Hebrides. TF 61 commenced covering operations with TF 17, operating east of TF 18 and conforming to their movements.

At about 1450 on 15 September, was torpedoed on the starboard side. Fires broke out on the carrier. Explosions multiplied the fires. Admiral Scott took command of TF 18. &quot;San Francisco&quot; and prepared to take the carrier in tow, but by 1520, the fires were out of control and destroyers began taking on survivors. torpedoed the burning hulk. TF 18 then headed for Espiritu Santo.

On the morning of 17 September, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, , and five destroyers put back to sea to rendezvous with TF 17 and resume coverage of reinforcement convoys. Other units of TF 18 had headed for Nouméa with &quot;Wasp&quot; survivors.

On 23 September, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, , , and , and Destroyer Squadron 12 (DesRon 12) became TF 64, a surface screening and attack force under the command of Admiral Scott in &quot;San Francisco&quot;. The next day, the force headed to the New Hebrides.

====Battle of Cape Esperance====

On 7 October 1942, TF 64 (minus &quot;Chester&quot; and &quot;Minneapolis&quot;) departed from Espiritu Santo, the New Hebrides, and moved back into the Solomons to cover Allied reinforcements and to intercept similar operations by the Japanese. On 11 October, at about 1615, the ships commenced a run northward from Rennel Island, to intercept an enemy force of two cruisers and six destroyers reported heading for Guadalcanal from the Buin-Faisi, Bougainville Island area. The force continued north to approach Savo Island in The Slot from the southwest.

By 2330, when the warships were approximately northwest of Savo Island, they turned to make a further search of the area. A few minutes after setting the new course, radar indicated unidentified ships to the west, several thousand yards distant. At about 2345, the Battle of Cape Esperance began.

Initial confusion caused both sides to momentarily check their fire in fear of hitting their own ships. Then, the battle was reopened and continued until 0020 on 12 October, when surviving Japanese ships retired toward the Shortland Islands. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot;, &quot;Boise&quot;, and , had been damaged. Later, &quot;Duncan&quot; went down. and a destroyer had been sunk during the surface action. Two more enemy destroyers were sunk on 12 October by Marine planes from Henderson Field. After the engagement, TF 64 retired to Espiritu Santo.

On 15 October, &quot;San Francisco&quot; resumed operations in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. On the evening of 20 October, her group was ordered back to Espiritu Santo. At 2119, submarine&#x27;s torpedoes were reported. &quot;Chester&quot; was hit amidships on the starboard side but continued under her own power. Three other torpedoes exploded: one off &quot;Helena&quot;″s starboard quarter; a second between &quot;Helena&quot; and &quot;San Francisco&quot;; and the third about off &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s port beam. Two others were sighted running on the surface.

&quot;San Francisco&quot; reached Espiritu Santo on the night of 21 October, but departed again on 22 October to intercept any enemy surface units approaching Guadalcanal from the north and to cover friendly reinforcements. On 28 October, Admiral Scott transferred to &quot;Atlanta&quot;. The next day, &quot;San Francisco&quot; returned to Espiritu Santo, and on 30 October, Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan, the commanding officer of &quot;San Francisco&quot; when the United States entered the war, returned to the ship and raised his flag as Commander, Task Group 64.4 (TG 64.4) and prospective TF 65.

====Naval Battle of Guadalcanal====

On 31 October 1942, the newly designated TF 65 departed from Espiritu Santo, the ships again headed into the Solomon Islands to cover troop landings on Guadalcanal. Bombardment missions in the Kokumbona and Koli Point areas followed. On 6 November, the transport group completed unloading, and the force retired, arriving at Espiritu Santo on 8 November. On 10 November, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, now flagship for TG 67.4, got underway again toward Guadalcanal.

Just before noon, a Japanese twin-float reconnaissance plane began shadowing the formation.

The force arrived off Lunga Point on 12 November, and the transports commenced unloading. By mid-afternoon, an approaching Japanese air group was reported. At 1318, the ships got underway. At 1408, 21 enemy planes attacked.

At 1416, an already-damaged torpedo bomber dropped its torpedo off &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s starboard quarter. The torpedo passed alongside, but the plane crashed into &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s control aft, swung around that structure, and plunged over the port side into the sea. 24 men were killed, 45 wounded, and one missing. Control aft was demolished. The ship&#x27;s secondary command post, Battle Two, was burned out but reestablished by dark. The aft anti-aircraft director and radar were out, and three 20 mm mounts destroyed.

Some of the wounded were transferred to , just before the approach of an enemy surface force was reported. The covering force escorted the transports out of the area, then reassembled and returned. At about midnight, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, in company with heavy cruiser USS &quot;Portland&quot;, the light cruisers &quot;Atlanta&quot;, &quot;Helena&quot;, and &quot;Juneau&quot;, and eight destroyers, entered Lengo Channel.

At 0125 on 13 November, a Japanese naval force was discovered about to the northwest. Rear Admiral Callaghan&#x27;s task group maneuvered to intercept, in what became the first engagement in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. At 0148, in almost pitch darkness, &quot;San Francisco&quot; opened fire on an enemy cruiser off her starboard beam. At 0151, she trained her guns on a small cruiser or large destroyer off her starboard bow. Then in an attempt to locate other targets, &quot;San Francisco&quot; accidentally targeted . &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s gunfire caused extensive damage to &quot;Atlanta&quot;, killing Admiral Scott and most of &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s bridge crew. Belatedly, &quot;San Francisco&quot; realized she was firing on a friendly ship and ceased. The green dye that &quot;San Francisco&quot; used to distinguish her shells from those of other ships, was later found on &quot;Atlanta&quot;″s superstructure before she sank. Shortly thereafter, was sighted and taken under fire, at an initial range of only . At such a close range the &quot;Hiei&quot;″s armour was unable to withstand the incoming 8-inch gunfire, resulting in her steering mechanism being crippled.

At about 0200, &quot;San Francisco&quot; trained her sights on . At the same time, she became the target of off her starboard bow and of a destroyer that had crossed her bow and was passing down her port side. The enemy battleship joined the cruiser and the destroyer in firing on &quot;San Francisco&quot; whose port battery engaged the destroyer but was put out of action, except for one mount. The battleship put the starboard battery out of commission. &quot;San Francisco&quot; swung left while her main battery continued to fire on the battleships which, with the cruiser and the destroyer, continued to pound &quot;San Francisco&quot;. A direct hit on the navigation bridge killed or badly wounded all officers, except for the communications officer, Lieutenant Commander Bruce McCandless. Command fell to the damage control officer, Lieutenant Commander Herbert E. Schonland, but he thought his own efforts were needed to keep the ship &quot;afloat and right-side up&quot;, so he ordered McCandless to stay at the conn. Steering and engine control were lost and shifted to Battle Two. Battle Two was out of commission by a direct hit from the port side, and control was again lost. It was reestablished in the conning tower, which itself soon received a hit from the starboard side. Steering and engine control were temporarily lost, and all communications were now dead.

Soon thereafter, the enemy ceased firing. &quot;San Francisco&quot; followed suit and withdrew eastward along the north coast of Guadalcanal.

86 men, including Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan and Captain Cassin Young, had been killed. Captain Young, like the &quot;San Francisco&quot;, was a veteran of the Pearl Harbor attack and was a Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Pearl Harbor. 85 had been wounded. Of seven missing, three were subsequently rescued. The ship had taken 45 hits. Structural damage was extensive, but not fatal. No hits had been received below the waterline. Twenty-two fires had been extinguished.

At about 0400, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, all her compasses out, followed &quot;Helena&quot; and &quot;Juneau&quot; through Sealark Channel en route to Espiritu Santo for initial repairs.

At about 1000, &quot;Juneau&quot;″s medical personnel transferred to &quot;San Francisco&quot; to assist in treating the numerous wounded. An hour later, &quot;Juneau&quot; took a torpedo on her port side from , striking in the vicinity of the bridge; the ship&#x27;s keel had been broken during the battle, leaving her an easy target for the enemy submarine. &quot;The entire ship seemed to explode in one mighty column of brown and white smoke and flame which rose easily a thousand feet in the air. The &quot;Juneau&quot; literally disintegrated.&quot; &quot;San Francisco&quot; was hit by several large fragments from &quot;Juneau&quot;. One man was hit and both his legs broken. Nothing was seen in the water after the smoke lifted. The surviving ships were ordered to keep going without stopping to look for survivors. Unfortunately, the 100+ survivors (out of a total complement of 697) of &quot;Juneau&quot; were forced to wait eight days for rescue while floating in the ocean, exposed to the elements and enduring both thirst and shark attacks. Only ten survived. Among those aboard the &quot;Juneau&quot; who did not survive were the five Sullivan brothers, all of whom were serving together on the ship.

On the afternoon of 14 November, &quot;San Francisco&quot; reached Espiritu Santo. For her participation in the action of the morning of the 13th, and for that of the night of 11–12 October, she received the Presidential Unit Citation. On 18 November, the cruiser sailed for Nouméa, and, on 23 November, she got underway toward the United States. She reached San Francisco on 11 December. Three days later, repairs were begun at Mare Island Naval Shipyard.

&quot;San Francisco&quot; had one current and three future Medal of Honor recipients on board at the time of the Battle of Guadalcanal. Captain Cassin Young had received the Medal of Honor for heroism at Pearl Harbor 11 months earlier. Rear Admiral Callaghan and Lieutenant Commanders Schonland and McCandless would receive the Medal of Honor at a later date. Callaghan was one of three U.S. Navy admirals to receive the Medal of Honor posthumously during World War II along with admirals Isaac Kidd who was killed at Pearl Harbor and Norman Scott who also died in the Battle of Guadalcanal.

===1943–1944===
During the yard period to repair battle damage, &quot;San Francisco&quot; received a general modernization similar to other US cruisers. Her forward superstructure was remodeled, with the bridge wings cut back, and most of the bridge windows either plated over or replaced by portholes. A large open bridge was built out at the 02 level, and modern SG surface search radar and air search radars added. In addition many 20mm and 40mm anti-aircraft cannons were installed. On 26 February 1943, she got underway to return to the South Pacific. After escorting convoy PW 2211 &quot;en route&quot;, &quot;San Francisco&quot; arrived at Nouméa on 20 March. Five days later, she continued on to Efate. She arrived back in the Hawaiian Islands in mid-April. She then headed north to the Aleutian Islands to join the North Pacific Force, TF 16, and reached Alaska toward the end of the month. Based at Kuluk Bay, Adak Island, she operated in the Aleutians for the next months. She patrolled the western approaches to the area; participated in the assault and occupation of Attu in May and of Kiska in July; and performed escort duties.
In mid-September, she was ordered back to Pearl Harbor for repairs and reassignment to TF 14. On 29 September, &quot;San Francisco&quot; departed Pearl Harbor in Task Unit 14.2.1 (TU 14.2.1) for a raid against Wake Island. On 5 October, the group arrived off the target area and conducted two runs by the enemy positions. On 11 October, her task unit returned to Pearl Harbor.

On 20 November, the force arrived off Makin. &quot;San Francisco&quot; participated in the pre-invasion bombardment of Betio, then patrolled outside the transport area to the west of Makin. On the 26th, she was detached and assigned to TG 50.1, joining , , , five cruisers, and six destroyers. With that force, she steamed toward the Marshall Islands to strike Japanese shipping and installations in the Kwajalein area. On 4 December, the carriers launched their planes against the targets. Shortly after noon, enemy aerial activity increased, and at 1250, &quot;San Francisco&quot; came under attack. Three torpedo bombers closed her on the port bow. Her guns &quot;splashed&quot; two. The third was shot down by &quot;Yorktown&quot;. But during the attack, the cruiser had been strafed several times. One man had been killed, and 22 were wounded. After dark, the Japanese returned, and on that night, &quot;Lexington&quot; was torpedoed. The force moved north and west. Shortly after 0130 on 5 December, enemy planes faded from the radar screens. The next day, the ships headed back to Pearl Harbor.

On 22 January 1944, &quot;San Francisco&quot; sortied with TF 52 and again headed for the Marshalls. On 29 January, the division, screened by destroyers, left the formation and moved against Japanese installations on Maloelap to neutralize them during the conquest of Kwajalein. Following the bombardment, the ships proceeded on to Kwajalein. &quot;San Francisco&quot; arrived off the atoll at about 0630 on 31 January. At 0730, she opened fire on targets of opportunity, initially a small ship inside Kwajalein lagoon. At 0849, she ceased firing. At 0900, she resumed firing at targets on Berlin and Beverly islands. Through the day, she continued to shell those islands, and, in late afternoon, added Bennett Island to her targets. During the next week, she provided pre-landing barrages and support fire for operations against Burton, Berlin, and Beverly islands. On 8 February, the cruiser sailed for Majuro, whence she would operate as a unit of TF 58, the fast carrier task force.

On 12 February, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, in TG 58.2, cleared Majuro lagoon. Four days later, the carriers launched their planes as part of Operation Hailstone. On the night of 16–17 February, was torpedoed. &quot;San Francisco&quot;, with others, was assigned to escort her eastward. On 19 February, the group split; &quot;Intrepid&quot;, with two destroyers, continued toward Pearl Harbor, while &quot;San Francisco&quot; and the remaining ships headed for Majuro. On 25 February, &quot;San Francisco&quot; sailed for Hawaii with TG 58.2. On 20 March, the group returned to Majuro, refueled, and departed again on 22 March to move against the Western Carolines. From 30 March to 1 April, carrier planes hit the Palaus and Woleai. &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s planes flew rescue missions.

On 6 April, the force was back in Majuro lagoon. A week later, the ships set a course for New Guinea. From 21 to 28 April, TG 58.2 supported the assault landings in the Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) area. On 29 April, the ships moved back into the Carolines for another raid against Truk. On 30 April, &quot;San Francisco&quot; was detached and, with eight other cruisers, moved against Satawan. On completion of that bombardment mission, the cruisers rejoined TG 58.2 and headed back to the Marshalls.

Initially at Majuro, &quot;San Francisco&quot; shifted to Kwajalein in early June, and on 10 June, departed that atoll in TG 53.15, the bombardment group of the Saipan invasion force. On 14 June, she commenced two days of shelling Tinian, and after the landings on Saipan shifted to fire support duties. On 16 June, she temporarily joined CruDiv 9 to bombard Guam. Word of a Japanese force en route to Saipan, however, interrupted the cannonade, and the ships returned to Saipan.

On 17 June, &quot;San Francisco&quot; refueled and took up station between the approaching enemy force and the amphibious force at Saipan. On the morning of 19 June, the Battle of the Philippine Sea opened for &quot;San Francisco&quot;. At about 1046, she was straddled fore and aft by bombs. &quot;... a mass of enemy planes on the screen at .&quot; At 1126, the cruiser opened fire. A 40 mm shell from &quot;Indianapolis&quot; set off &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s smoke screen generators. By noon, quiet had returned. At 1424, dive bombers made the last Japanese attack. By 20 June, &quot;San Francisco&quot; steamed westward in pursuit of the Japanese force. The next day, she returned to the Saipan area and resumed operations with the covering force for the transports. On 8 July, &quot;San Francisco&quot; again steamed to Guam to bombard enemy positions. During the next four days, she shelled targets in the Agat and Agana areas. On 12 July, she returned to Saipan to replenish and refuel, and on 18 July, again took station off Guam.

From 18 to 20 July, she shelled enemy positions, supported beach demolition units, and provided night harassing and defense repair interdiction in the Agat and Faci Point areas. On 21 July, she began to support Marines assaulting the Agat beaches. On 24 July, the cruiser shifted her fire to Orote Point.

On 30 July, she headed, via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, for San Francisco. The cruiser arrived back on the west coast on 16 August for overhaul.

On 31 October, she steamed west again, and on 21 November arrived at Ulithi, where she resumed flagship duties for CruDiv 6. On 10 December, she cleared the anchorage and moved toward the Philippines in TG 38.1. On 14–15 December, during carrier strikes against Luzon, &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s planes were employed on antisubmarine patrol and in rescue work. On 16 December, the force headed for a rendezvous with TG 30.17, the replenishment force. A typhoon interrupted the refueling operations; and the ships rode out the storm for the next two days. On 19 December, she participated in a search for survivors from three destroyers which had gone down during the typhoon.

On 20 December, TF 38 turned westward again to resume operations against Luzon; but high seas precluded strikes. On 24 December, the force returned to Ulithi.

===1945===
Six days later, the force again sortied from Ulithi. On 2–3 January 1945, strikes were conducted against Formosa. From 5–7 January, Luzon was hit. On 9 January, fighter sweeps against Formosa were resumed. The force then headed for the Bashi Channel and a five-day, high-speed strike against enemy surface units in the South China Sea and against installations along the coast of Indochina. On 15–16 January, the Hong Kong-Amoy-Swatow area was hit, and on 20 January, the force passed through Luzon Strait to resume operations against Formosa. On 21 January, aerial opposition was constant. Bogies appeared on the screen throughout the day. and were hit. On 22 January, strikes were launched against the Ryukyu Islands, and the next day, the force headed for the Western Carolines.

Arriving on 26 January, the ships sailed again on 10 February. On 16–17 February, strikes were conducted against air facilities in central Honshū. On 18 February, the force moved toward the Volcano and Bonin Islands, and on 19 February, covering operations for the Iwo Jima assault began. The next day, &quot;San Francisco&quot; closed on Iwo Jima with other cruisers and assumed fire support duties, which she continued until 23 February. Then she headed back toward Japan. On 25 February, Tokyo was the target. Poor weather prohibited operations against Nagoya on the following day, and on 27 February, the force headed back to Ulithi.

On 21 March, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, now attached to Task Force 54 (TF 54) for the invasion of Okinawa, departed Ulithi for the Ryukyus. On 25 March, she approached Kerama Retto, west of Okinawa, and furnished fire support for minesweeping and underwater demolition operations. That night, she retired and the next morning moved back in to support the landings and supply counter battery fire on Aka, Keruma, Zamami, and Yakabi Islands.

By the morning of 27 March, aerial resistance had begun. The next day, &quot;San Francisco&quot; shifted to Okinawa for shore bombardment in preparation for the assault landings scheduled for 1 April. On that day, she took up station in fire support sector 5, west of Naha, and, for the next five days, shelled enemy emplacements, caves, pillboxes, road junctions, and tanks, truck, and troop concentrations. At night, she provided harassing fire near the beachhead.

On 6 April, the cruiser retired to Kerama Retto, refueled and took on ammunition, assisted in splashing a Nakajima B6N &quot;Jill&quot; torpedo bomber, then rejoined TF 54 off Okinawa as that force underwent another air raid. &quot;San Francisco&quot; downed a Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; torpedo bomber. Dawn of 7 April brought another air raid, during which a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attempted to crash the cruiser. It was splashed off the starboard bow. After the raid, &quot;San Francisco&quot; shifted to TF 51 for fire support missions on the east coast of Okinawa, rejoining TF 54 on the west coast in late afternoon. On 11 April, air attacks increased, and the next day, &quot;San Francisco&quot; set an Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bomber on fire. The plane then glanced off a merchant ship and hit the water, enveloped in flames.

On 13–14 April, the cruiser again operated with TF 51 off the east coast of the embattled island. The next day, she returned to Kerama Retto, there proceeding to Okinawa and operations with TF 54 in the transport area. There she provided night illumination to detect swimmers and &quot;Shinyo&quot; suicide boats, and just before midnight assisted in sinking one of the latter. During the night, two further attempts by &quot;Shinyo&quot;s to close the transports were thwarted.

With dawn, &quot;San Francisco&quot; returned to the Naha area to shell the airfield there. On 17 April, she moved up the coast and fired on the Machinate air field. The next day, she again shifted to the eastern side of the island and, that night, anchored in Nakagusuku Wan. The next day, &quot;San Francisco&quot; supported troops in the southern part of the island. From 21 to 24 April, she shelled targets in the Naha airstrip area; and got underway for Ulithi.

On 13 May, &quot;San Francisco&quot; returned to Okinawa, arriving in Nakagusuku Wan and resuming support activities against targets in southern Okinawa. For the next few days, &quot;San Francisco&quot; supported the 96th Infantry Division in an area to the southeast of Yonabaru. On 20 May, she shifted to Kutaka Shima, and by the night of 22 May, she had depleted her supply of ammunition for her main batteries. On 25 May, the Japanese launched a large air attack against Allied shipping in Nakagusuku Wan. On 27 May, &quot;San Francisco&quot; provided fire support for the 77th Infantry Division, and retired to Kerama Retto the next day. On 30 May, the cruiser returned to the western side of Okinawa and, for the next two weeks, supported operations of the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions.

On 21 June, &quot;San Francisco&quot; was ordered to join TG 32.15, southeast of Okinawa. A week later, she put into Kerama Retto for a brief stay, then rejoined that group. In early July, she provided cover for the eastern anchorage. On 3 July, she sailed toward the Philippines to prepare for an invasion of the Japanese home islands. The cessation of hostilities in mid-August, however, obviated that operation, and &quot;San Francisco&quot; prepared for occupation duty.

Between 7 December 1941 and 7 October 1945, &quot;San Francisco&quot; travelled 480,000 km and burned 114,478,423 litres of fuel oil. On her voyages, she crossed the equator 24 times and the international date line 33 times. Her guns fired 11,022 203mm shells, 24,191 127mm shells, 70,243 40mm shells and 73,904 20mm shells and her crew suffered 267 combat casualties. Her planes flew for 3,714 hours. The crew consumed 3,983,712 kg of edible provisions, ate 332,937 kg of beef, ate 925,328 kg of potatoes &amp; ate 5,760,000 slices of bread.

==Post-war==
On 28 August 1945, the cruiser departed Subic Bay for the China coast. After a show of force in the Yellow Sea and Gulf of Pohai areas, she covered minesweeping operations, and on 8 October anchored at Inchon, Korea. From 13 to 16 October, she participated in another show of force operation in the Gulf of Pohai area, then returned to Inchon, where Rear Admiral Jerauld Wright, Commander, CruDiv 6, acted as senior member of the committee for the surrender of Japanese naval forces in Korea.

On 27 November, &quot;San Francisco&quot; headed home. Arriving at San Francisco in mid-December, she continued on to the east coast on 5 January 1946, and arrived at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for inactivation on 19 January. Decommissioned on 10 February, she was berthed with the Philadelphia Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until 1 March 1959, when her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. On 9 September, she was sold to the Union Mineral and Alloys Corp., New York, and scrapped at Panama City, Florida, in 1961.

==War memorials==
During the December 1942 repair at Mare Island, it was necessary to extensively rebuild the bridge. The bridge wings were removed as part of that repair, and are now part of a memorial to the ship on a promontory in Lands End, San Francisco at Golden Gate National Recreation Area overlooking the Pacific Ocean. One wing has extensive battle damage from the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. They are set on the great circle course from San Francisco to Guadalcanal. The old ship&#x27;s bell is housed at the Marines Memorial Club in San Francisco.

==Awards==
&quot;San Francisco&quot; was among the most decorated ships in US service during World War II. &quot;San Francisco&quot; earned 17 battle stars during World War II, and when combined with the crewmember&#x27;s awards of Medals of Honor, Navy Crosses, Silver Stars, etc., she is the second most decorated US ship of World War II after USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, CV-6. For her participation in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and Battle of Cape Esperance, she was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation with star. For the same action, three members of her crew were awarded the Medal of Honor: Lieutenant Commander Herbert E. Schonland, Lieutenant Commander Bruce McCandless, and Boatswain&#x27;s Mate 1st Class Reinhardt J. Keppler (posthumous). Admiral Callaghan was also awarded the Medal of Honor (posthumous).

<text>Michael David Capellas (born August 19, 1954) is an American executive in the computer and telecommunication industries. Capellas served as chairman and CEO of First Data Corporation, acting CEO of Serena Software, chairman and CEO of Compaq Computer Corporation until its merger with Hewlett-Packard where he became president of the post-merger company briefly, and president and CEO of WorldCom (later MCI) where he led its merger with Verizon.

==Early years==

Capellas claims that he inherited a gritty determination from his father, a Greek citizen who fought with the Greek Army against the Germans in Italy in World War II. After the war, the elder Capellas met and married his wife, Juliet, in Italy. The family then emigrated to Ohio where Capellas&#x27; father worked his way up from laborer to superintendent at the Republic Steel Corp. &quot;My dad had an unbelievable work ethic. He was intensely loyal to the company. He worked there for 30 years,&quot; says Capellas.

As an undergraduate at Kent State University, Capellas developed an interest in computers. Shortly after he graduated with a BBA from Kent State, Capellas met his future wife, Marie Angelillo, a former nurse. The two married in 1979, and for the next 20 years they traveled around the world as Capellas climbed the ranks of each company he joined.

==Business==
Capellas began his career at Republic Steel. He went on to hold senior executive roles at Schlumberger, Benchmarking Partners, SAP, and Oracle Corporation. Capellas joined Compaq Computer Corporation as CIO in 1998. In 1999, when president and chief executive officer (CEO) Eckhard Pfeiffer was forced to resign after a boardroom coup led by chairman Benjamin M. Rosen, Rosen took on the capacity of interim CEO while Capellas was elevated to COO. Several months later, Capellas became permanent CEO and Chairman of Compaq.

As chairman and CEO of Compaq between 1999 and 2001, Capellas helped repair the relationship between Microsoft and Compaq, which had eroded over the years. His efforts resulted in Compaq becoming Microsoft&#x27;s key strategic partner for the release of its Windows 2000 operating system.

In 2001, Capellas led Compaq into an acquisition by Hewlett-Packard, but the deal was delayed for eight months because of a proxy and boardroom battle within HP. Finally, on May 3, 2002, Hewlett-Packard announced approval of the acquisition and Capellas became president of the post-merger Hewlett-Packard, under CEO Carly Fiorina, to ease the integration of the two companies. However, Capellas was reported not to be happy with his role, being said not to be utilized and being unlikely to become CEO as the board supported Fiorina. Capellas stepped down on November 12, 2002, just six months on the job. His former role of president was not filled as the executives who reported to him then reported directly to the CEO.

In December 2002, Capellas became the turnaround president and CEO of WorldCom (later MCI). He led a successful restructuring of the organization, one of the largest in corporate history, and stepped down as CEO after MCI&#x27;s merger with Verizon in 2006.

In December 2006, Capellas was appointed acting CEO of Serena Software, selected by Silver Lake Partners, the company that took Serena private in March 2006 and where Capellas served as a senior advisor.

On July 10, 2007, Capellas was identified as the new CEO of First Data Corporation. The position was to become effective upon the completion of the leveraged buyout (LBO) of First Data by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.

In 2010 it was announced he would be chairman and CEO of VCE, a joint venture of Cisco Systems and EMC Corporation with investment from Intel and VMware that specializes in cloud computing. 
In July 2012 a new president and CEO of VCE replaced Capellas.

Capellas is on the board of directors for Cisco, and was on the national board of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. In 2001, Capellas was inducted into the Warren, Ohio Schools Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame.

<text>Pedro Francisco Carmona Estanga (born 6 July 1941) is a former Venezuelan business leader who was briefly installed as acting president of Venezuela in place of Hugo Chávez, following the attempted military coup in April 2002.

==April 2002==

The early part of 2002 saw mass protests and a general strike by opponents of Hugo Chávez. On 11 April 2002, following clashes between both supporters and opponents of Chávez, Lucas Rincón, commander-in-chief of the Venezuelan Armed Forces, announced in a nationwide broadcast that Chávez had tendered his resignation from the presidency. While Chávez was brought to a military base and held there, military leaders appointed Carmona as the transitional President of Venezuela.

In the face of crowds of Chávez supporters taking to the streets and under pressure from some quarters of the military, Chávez was restored to office. During Carmona&#x27;s 36-hour government, military officers held Chávez and attempted to force his exile. Additionally, security forces conducted raids without warrants and took some Chávez supporters into custody illegally, including National Assembly deputy Tarek William Saab, a member of the Chávez-aligned MVR, who was taken into protective custody by security forces after a large crowd had gathered around his home, threatening him and his family. He was held incommunicado for several hours.

After the coup, Carmona was placed under house arrest, but he was able to gain asylum in the Colombian embassy after an anti-Chávez protest drew away his security detail. Later, he was granted asylum in Colombia, where he has worked as a tenured lecturer at the Sergio Arboleda University.

They have released three studio albums, &quot;Since I Left You&quot; (2000), &quot;Wildflower&quot; (2016), and &quot;We Will Always Love You&quot; (2020), and perform live and recorded DJ sets. The group currently consists of Robbie Chater and Tony Di Blasi. 

The band is an exponent of the plunderphonics genre, and their first album, &quot;Since I Left You,&quot; has been recognised by many critics as the most important example of the genre.

==Career==
===1994–1996: Origins===
Three future Avalanches members formed Alarm 115 in Melbourne in 1994 as a noise punk outfit inspired by Drive Like Jehu, The Fall, and Ultra Bide. The line-up was Robbie Chater on keyboards, Tony Di Blasi on keyboards, bass and backing vocals, and Darren Seltmann on vocals (ex-Ripe). By 1995, Manabu Etoh joined on drums. The group bought instruments, recording gear and numerous old vinyl records by the crate at second-hand shops. When Etoh was deported and Alarm 115 disbanded, these records became the core of a new project. Chater was a film student at RMIT University and had access to a recording studio, which he and Seltmann used to turn the records into a 30-song demo tape labelled &quot;Pan Amateurs&quot;. In 1997 a new group consisting of Chater, Di Blasi, Seltmann, and Gordon McQuilten on keyboards was assembled to play the tracks live. Chater, Di Blasi and McQuilten had all been school mates in Maryborough. Starting in July, their first four shows were played under different names: Swinging Monkey Cocks, Quentin&#x27;s Brittle Bones, and Whoops Downs Syndrome. The group became &quot;The Avalanches&quot; at their fifth gig, borrowing the new band name from an American surf rock band, which recorded only one album, &quot;Ski Surfin&#x27; with the Avalanches&quot;, in 1963.

===1997–1999: Early releases===
After playing the support slot for Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, they rose to prominence quickly. Trifekta Records released the debut single &quot;Rock City&quot; in September 1997. This was followed in December by their seven-track extended play, &quot;El Producto&quot;, on Steve Pavlovic&#x27;s Wondergram Records. Around this time, DJ Dexter Fabay joined the group on turntables and keyboards. Based on &quot;El Producto&quot;&#x27;s success, Pavlovic signed the Avalanches to his new Modular Recordings label in May 1998. Leo Silvermann signed them to his label, Rex Records, for the exclusive United Kingdom four-track EP &quot;Undersea Community&quot;, which released in March 1999. The group&#x27;s profile grew with support slots on tours by the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, Stereolab, and Beck. The band also played at the Tibetan Freedom Concert at Sydney Olympic Park, Homebush Bay, Sydney. James Dela Cruz was added to the live line-up on turntables and keyboards, and made his debut with the band at The Palace, St Kilda, supporting Public Enemy. In September 1999 Modular Recordings issued a four-track EP &quot;Electricity&quot; in Australia (12&quot;) and a two-track UK (7&quot;) version.

===2000–2004: &quot;Since I Left You&quot;===

From mid-1998, the Avalanches had been recording their debut album, initially under the working title &quot;Pablo&#x27;s Cruise&quot;. In February 2000 they finished mixing it at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne. Its initial launch date in 2000 was delayed due to the need for sample clearances and overseas interest. By July, with the album, now titled &quot;Since I Left You&quot;, overdue, Chater&#x27;s &quot;Gimix&quot; cassette was made available. This mixtape blended previews of forthcoming album tracks with some band favourites. The first Australian single from the album, &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot;, was issued in August, which peaked in the top 50 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It reached No. 6 in Triple J&#x27;s 2000 Hottest 100 countdown, the world&#x27;s largest annual radio music poll. In October the band undertook their first Australian headline tour, appearing in all capital cities. All dates were completely sold out. Seltmann broke his leg in Brisbane in an on-stage collision with bassist and singer Di Blasi.

In November 2000, &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was launched in Melbourne with a boat cruise party aboard the Victoria Star, through Port Phillip Bay, with &quot;The Face&quot; and other UK media flying to Australia to cover the event. The band won six Australian Dance Music Awards. They travelled to the UK for a three-week promotional stint, including DJ sets at the Social and Fabric Nightclubs, while their remix of Badly Drawn Boy&#x27;s &quot;The Shining&quot; was released in the UK. Chater estimated that &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was assembled from approximately 3,500 vinyl samples. One notable example is a sample of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Holiday&quot; on the track &quot;Stay Another Season&quot;.

The UK version of &quot;Since I Left You&quot; was released by XL Recordings in 2001, which debuted at No. 8 on the UK Albums Chart in April, and quickly topped 200,000 sales in the UK. Also that month, the first UK single from the album, the title track &quot;Since I Left You&quot;, was released and debuted at No. 16 on the UK Singles Chart.

The &quot;Since I Left You&quot; video won Video of the Year at the MTV Europe Music Awards. In July 2001 the second UK single, &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot;, debuted at No. 18. The video for &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot; was later awarded the runner-up prize at Soho Shorts Film Festival in the UK. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, the group won four categories, Best New Artist – Album and Best Dance Release for &quot;Since I Left You&quot;, Best New Artist – Single for &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot;, and Producer of the Year for Bobbydazzler (production name for Chater and Seltmann). They were also nominated in five additional categories, Album of the Year and Best Group for &quot;Since I Left You&quot;, Single of the Year for &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot;, Engineer of the Year by Tony Espie and Bobbydazzler and Best Cover Art by Bobbydazzler for &quot;Since I Left You&quot;.

London-Sire Records released the United States version in November 2001. When the label dissolved in 2003, the Avalanches switched to Elektra. The album was also released in Japan, with bonus track &quot;Everyday&quot;. The &quot;At Last Alone&quot; EP (rescheduled tour EP with revised track listing) was also issued in Japan. In the United States, the album peaked at No. 31 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Heatseekers chart and No. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Electronic Albums chart. In the US, a promotional &quot;Since I Left You&quot; 12&quot; featuring remixes from Stereolab and Prince Paul was released, and the Avalanches&#x27; remix of the Manic Street Preachers&#x27; &quot;So Why So Sad&quot; was issued worldwide.

Professional critics included &quot;Since I Left You&quot; on their &quot;Best of 2000s&quot; lists. The album was placed at No. 4 in &quot;Juice&quot; magazine&#x27;s &#x27;Best Australian albums of all time&#x27; list, and No. 10 in Pitchfork Media&#x27;s top albums of the decade. In its review, Pitchfork Media bestowed the album with a high 9.5 score. In October 2010, the album was listed at No. 10 in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;. In 2011, American hip hop artist Questlove named &quot;Since I Left You&quot; in his top ten albums list.

===2005–2019: &quot;Wildflower&quot;===

The Avalanches had been working on their second album since at least 2005. Seltmann had said the album was starting out as &quot;ambient world music&quot;, but it was still moving in different directions and would feature both samples and live music. Chater later revealed that Seltmann had left the group by 2006, &quot;we stopped working together... I was always making stuff and getting on with it, and the new record wasn&#x27;t materialising quickly. He had a kid, a family, and I guess he realised before I did that it was going to take a long time.&quot;

Subsequent announcements were made of the album&#x27;s release, however, it had not appeared by December 2011. Other artists began to announce having worked with the band on tracks around that time. In February 2014 Modular Recordings confirmed Seltmann had left, stating &quot;officially the band is Robbie Chater and Tony Di Blasi right now.&quot; The band&#x27;s official Facebook page was updated in 2015, listing James Dela Cruz had rejoined.

In April 2016 the Avalanches added new images of a gold butterfly on black cloth to their social media accounts and official website. On 24 May, the group posted a video poking fun at their long hiatus since their last album and the continued speculation of a follow-up release. On 2 June 2016 the lead single, &quot;Frankie Sinatra&quot;, from their second album, was premiered on Australian radio station Triple J. The title of the album was revealed the same day to be &quot;Wildflower&quot;. It appeared in the following month, with Chater and Di Blasi as co-producers.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2016 the group received six more nominations, Album of the Year, Best Dance Release and Best Group for &quot;Wildflower&quot;; Producer of the Year for Chater and Di Blasi; Engineer of the Year for Chater and Espie; and Best Cover Art for Lost Art (Chater). At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received an average score of 83, based on 33 reviews, indicating critical acclaim. It peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

===2020–present: &quot;We Will Always Love You&quot;===

On 11 February 2020, the Avalanches posted a photo of a promotional billboard in Melbourne advertising a website. On the website, a video played containing several faint voices, followed by a Morse code message stating &#x27;WWALY&#x27;. On 14 February, the website was updated with a second video containing another morse code message, this time spelling &quot;20 FEB&quot;. Two days later on 16 February, the Avalanches posted a photo of a second billboard in London.

On 20 February 2020, the Avalanches released a single, &quot;We Will Always Love You&quot; featuring Blood Orange. With this release, they also confirmed their third studio album. On 18 March, they released another single, &quot;Running Red Lights&quot; featuring Pink Siifu and Rivers Cuomo from Weezer. The song is dedicated to David Berman and features lyrics from the Purple Mountains song &quot;Darkness and Cold&quot;.

The album, entitled &quot;We Will Always Love You&quot; was released on 11 December 2020 and features contributions from Denzel Curry, Tricky and Jamie xx.

In 2024, they featured on the Jamie xx track &#x27;All You Children&#x27; from his album &quot;In Waves&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The band has been noted as an important pioneering example of plunderphonics, with one reviewer referring to them as the &quot;legendary plunderphonics powerhouse&quot;. Their first album, &quot;Since I Left You&quot; released in 2000, has been highlighted as influential, a masterpiece and a particular iconic example of the genre. The album has been noted for the large amount of samples it uses, around 3500,and the fact it is entirely made of samples with no live music. It was also noted for its complexity and the use of dialogue samples. The album has been described as incredibly complex, and even dadaist. &quot;Since I Left You&quot; has appeared on various top examples of the Plunderhouse genre, and has also been described as one of the three pivotal plunderphonics albums, along with DJ Shadow’s &quot;Endtroducing&quot; in 1996, and J Dilla&#x27;s &quot;Donuts&quot; in 2006.

A number of music critics, including Volksgeist, Amar Edirwira writing for &quot;VinylFactory&quot; and others regard &quot;Since I Left You&quot; as the best plunderphonics album of all time.

It&#x27;s been noted by legal commentary that the small size of samples used by the Avalanches in their work may not cross the threshold of being significant, which would then allow for a legal case to be brought by the original sampled artist.

==Live performances==

The Avalanches, initially, played live using samplers, analogue keyboards, bass guitar, drum kit, and theremin. Their set-up later included four turntables, a percussion stand, and a battery of MIDI-controlled special effects.

The band performed at festivals during 2000–2001, including the Big Day Out, Falls Festival and V1. For their European live tour, Peter &quot;Snakey&quot; Whitford was used as a touring percussionist, he had previously played in the Afro Psych band Prophecy throughout the Indonesian islands. Seltmann broke his ankle during the band&#x27;s Electric Ballroom show in London, while Dela Cruz suffered a concussion on-stage at the V2001 festival. The remaining live dates were DJ sets with Chater only. Despite this, the band eventually received the Best Live Act 2001 award from &quot;MUZIK&quot; magazine. This format continued for the United States and Japan Since I Left You Tours. Chater, Dela Cruz and Fabay also took the DJ show around Australia, calling themselves the Magic Midgets.

The Avalanches continued DJing at Australian festivals such as Golden Plains and Splendour in the Grass throughout 2006 and into 2007, although these sets were a return to a heavier, club sound and markedly different from the previous Brains&#x27; DJ sets. The group returned to live performances in 2016, with a performance at Australian music festival Splendour in the Grass. Their live setup feature Chater on bass and Di Blasi on turntables, alongside guest musicians Paris Jeffree on drums, Spank Rock as MC, and Eliza Wolfgramm on vocals.

In May 2017 The Avalanches curated &quot;The Avalanches – Since I Left You Block Party&quot; as part of Sydney&#x27;s Vivid LIVE festival. Playing outdoors at the Sydney Opera House, The Avalanches headlined and were joined by &#x27;special guests&#x27; DJ Shadow, Briggs, Sampa the Great, Jonti and DJ JNETT.

<doc id="556555" wikidata="Q1445791" url="?curid=556555" title="Tennen Rishin-ryū">
<text>is a Japanese martial art, commonly known as the style practiced by several core members of the Shinsengumi.

==Origins==

The Tennen Rishin ryu is a traditional swordsmanship school, codified during the Kansei Era (1789–1801) by Kondō Kuranosuke Nagahiro (or Nagamichi). There is limited information in regards to him: he came from Tōtōmi Province (today&#x27;s western Shizuoka Prefecture), but no one knows when he was born. He visited many provinces for his musha shugyō, eventually becoming a member of the Kashima Shintō-ryū. Even though he would have most likely been appointed as a teacher of this style, he left the Shintō-ryū aiming to create a new sword based combat system. In fact, during those years the Japanese swordsmanship gradually evolved from the rigid katageiko (form practice performed with either bokutō or with dull-edged swords called habiki) towards a free practice called shinaigeiko (also known as gekiken). This kind of training allowed two practitioners to spar without the risk of severe injury thanks to bamboo swords (shinai) and armor protecting the head (men), the arm (kote), and the torso (dō). With some exceptions, the popular gekiken of the second half of Edo period was quite similar to modern Kendō.

Kuranosuke organized all his martial arts knowledge into a new system of teaching and transmission; for this reason, even if codified during the Edo period, Tennen Rishin Ryū could be listed among new schools called shin ryūha. This was a breaking point between koryū (old schools) and gendai budō (martial arts developed after the Meiji Restoration). He created his own school by synthesizing an actual sword fight every occasion, sticking to a fencing style whose last goal was to obtain full victory without losing composure in front of an enemy. At the end of his musha shugyō Kuranosuke went to Edo. While he was establishing a dōjō in Yagenbori he most likely went to teach in the Sagami area (today&#x27;s Kanagawa Prefecture) and Tama area (western part of Tōkyō). Since Tama was the birthplace of 2nd generation (Kondō Sansuke), 3rd generation (Kondō Shūsuke) and 4th generation (Kondō Isami) headmasters, there is little doubt that this actually happened. Kuranosuke died in the 4th year of Bunka era (1807).
The Shinsengumi ceased to exist after the 2nd year of Meiji (1869), with the end of the Boshin War and the collapse of Bakufu. It is commonly believed that the Boshin War marked the end of Tennen Rishin Ryū since Kondō Isami was sentenced to death and beheaded in Itabashi, Okita Sōji died of tuberculosis, and both Inoue Genzaburō and Hijikata Toshizō died in battle (the first one at Toba-fushimi and the latter in the battle of Goryōkaku). However, this is not historically correct. It was probably a great loss for the Shieikan dōjō, but the tradition survived. There were many teachers of the school at that time, most of them in the Tama area.

==During Meiji, Taishō and Shōwa periods==

Before leaving for Kyōto 1863, Kondō Isami adopted his older brother Miyagawa Otogorō&#x27;s second son, Miyagawa Yūgorō (born in 1851). The boy was supposed to marry Tama, Kondō&#x27;s daughter (born in 1862) from a wedding with Matsui Tsune once the girl reached the age to be wed. Even though he did not probably receive any teaching from Kondō, Yūgorō was already practicing Tennen Rishin Ryū with his real father. Miyagawa Otogorō was a pupil of Tennen Rishin Ryū as well, since he joined the school together with his younger brother Katsugorō (the latter Kondō Isami). After the death of Kondō in 1868, Yūgorō continued his training under several teachers. He probably studied with Harada Kamezō (son of Harada Chūji, a disciple of Kondō Shūsuke), despite another theory claiming that he was to become a pupil of Matsuzaki Watagorō (eldest son of Matsuzaki Shōsaku, student of the nidaime Sansuke). Yūgorō eventually opened his own dōjō in 1876 in Kami-ishihara (Chōfu city), calling it Hatsuunkan. It is said that Yamaoka Tesshū (1836-1888), the founder of Ittō Shōden Mutō Ryū and one of strongest swordsman of Bakumatsu and early Meiji periods, gave this name (translated as &quot;the hall where the dark clouds are removed&quot;) upon his arrival. In 1883, Yūgorō&#x27;s first son Hisatarō was born. However, his mother, Tama, died three years later in 1886. The bloodline of Kondō Isamu ceased to exist when Hisatarō died in the Russo-Japanese war of 1905 at the age of twenty-two.

Yūgorō was remarried with a woman from Kokubunji city, called Tayo. From this union Kondō Shinkichi was born. Kondō Yūgorō eventually divorced from his new wife because she had a bad relationship with Matsui Tsune, the wife of Kondō Isamu and mother of Yūgorō’s wife Tama. The third and the last marriage the godaime contracted was with a girl named Kashi.

Kondō Yūgorō died in 1933, aged 83. Under his direction, the Hatsuunkan greatly flourished, gathering thousands of practitioners in the Tama area. At the beginning of Shōwa period he was interviewed by Shimozawa Kan (1892–1968), a writer whose Shinsengumi related books would go to inspire an entire literature genre in regards to the swordsmen corps. In fact, a large portion of Tennen Rishin Ryū&#x27;s fame was due to jidai shōsetsu (historical novels).
The best disciple of Kondō Yūgorō, Sakurai Kinpachi, inherited the title of 6th generation headmaster when his teacher was still alive. However, in 1932, he was forced to leave the school since he moved to Hokkaidō. The school&#x27;s fate was then passed to Yūgorō&#x27;s son, Shinkichi, who became the 7th generation headmaster (nanadaime). Shinkichi also served as a Kendō assistant teacher (joshu) for the Keishichō, the police department.

Kondō Shinkichi died in his early forties during 1936. Afterwards, the Kondō line was left without guidance for several years until a new pupil, named Katō Isuke (student of Yūgorō and Shinkichi), returned from the war to claim the position of headmaster.

<doc id="556557" wikidata="Q606881" url="?curid=556557" title="Star Trek project">
<text>Star Trek is the code name that was given to a secret prototype project, running a port of Macintosh System 7 and its applications on Intel-compatible x86 personal computers. The project, starting in February 1992, was conceived in collaboration between Apple Computer, who provided the majority of engineers, and Novell, who at the time was one of the leaders of cross-platform file-servers. The plan was that Novell would market the resulting OS as a challenge to Microsoft Windows, but the project was discontinued in 1993 and never released, although components were reused in other projects. The project was named after the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction franchise with the slogan &quot;To boldly go where no Mac has gone before&quot;.

==History==
The impetus for the creation of the Star Trek project began out of Novell&#x27;s desire to increase its competition against the monopoly of Microsoft and its DOS-based Windows products. While Microsoft was eventually convicted many years later of illegal monopoly status, Novell had called Microsoft&#x27;s presence &quot;predatory&quot; and the US Department of Justice had called it &quot;exclusionary&quot; and &quot;unlawful&quot;. Novell&#x27;s first idea to extend its desktop presence with a graphical computing environment was to adapt Digital Research&#x27;s GEM desktop environment, but Novell&#x27;s legal department rejected this due to apprehension of a possible legal response from Apple, so the company went directly to Apple. With shared concerns in the anti-competitive marketplace, Intel&#x27;s CEO Andy Grove supported the two companies in launching their joint project Star Trek on February 14, 1992 (Valentine&#x27;s Day).

Apple set a deadline of October 31, 1992 (Halloween Day), promising the engineering team members a performance bonus of a large cash award and a vacation in Cancun, Mexico. Of the project, team member Fred Monroe later reflected, &quot;We worked like dogs. It was some of the most fun I&#x27;ve had working&quot;.

Achieving their deadline goal and receiving their bonuses, the developers eventually reached a point where they could boot an Intel 486 PC (with very specific hardware) into System 7.1, and its on-screen appearance was indistinguishable from a Mac. However, every program would then need to be ported to the new x86 architecture to run. It was to sit on top of a then upcoming release of DR DOS and it was noted that programs would have to be recompiled.
The tagline for the project was &quot;to boldly go where no Mac has gone before&quot;, which &quot;Computerworld&quot; mocked with the comment &quot;the OS that boldly goes where everyone else has been&quot;.

However, the project was canceled in mid-1993 because of political infighting, personnel issues, and the questionable marketability of such a project. Apple&#x27;s side of the project had seen the exit of a supportive CEO, John Sculley, in favor of a new CEO, Michael Spindler. Spindler was not interested in the project, instead reallocating most software engineering resources toward the company&#x27;s total migration to the competing PowerPC architecture. While Apple came close to releasing Rhapsody in 1998 on x86 systems, even going so far as to ship a developer release for Intel hardware, no Macintosh operating systems launched natively on Intel hardware until the official transition of Mac OS X in 2006.

==Architecture==
Star Trek was designed as a hybrid of Apple&#x27;s Macintosh operating system, made to run as an operating system GUI shell application upon Novell&#x27;s next in-development version of the DR DOS operating system. It was designed so that a user could think of it as a standalone application platform and general computing environment, in a concept similar to Microsoft&#x27;s competing Windows 3.1x, running on top of DOS. This was a radical and tedious departure both technologically and culturally, because at that time, the Macintosh system software had only ever officially run on Apple&#x27;s own computers, which were all based on the Motorola 68000 architecture.

The system was built on the successor of Digital Research&#x27;s DR DOS 6.0 (BDOS level 6.7 and 7.1) and NetWare PalmDOS 1.0 (code named &quot;Merlin&quot;, BDOS level 7.0), Novell&#x27;s DR DOS &quot;Panther&quot; as a fully PC DOS compatible 16-bit disk operating system (with genuinely DOS compatible internal data structures) for bootstrapping, media access, device drivers and file system support. The system would utilize DR DOS&#x27;s new &quot;Vladivar&quot; Extended DOS component with flat memory support, which had been under development since 1991. &quot;Vladivar&quot; (codice_1 aka codice_2 + codice_3) was a dynamically loadable 32-bit protected mode system core for advanced memory management, hardware virtualization, scheduling and domain management for pre-emptive multithreading within applications as well as multitasking of independent applications running in different virtual DOS machines (comparable to Windows 386 Enhanced Mode but without a GUI).

Thereby, the previously loaded DOS environment including all its device drivers became part of the system domain under the multitasker. Unless specific protected mode virtual device drivers were loaded, hardware access got tunneled through this 16-bit sub-system by default. For maximum speed at minimum resource footprint, the DR DOS BIOS, BDOS kernel, device drivers, memory managers and the multitasker were written in pure x86 assembly language. Apple&#x27;s port of System 7.1 would run on top of this high-performance yet light-weight hybrid 32-bit/16-bit protected mode multitasking environment as a graphical system and shell in user space. Macintosh resource forks and long filenames were mapped onto the FAT12 and FAT16 file systems.

== Legacy ==
Though the joint effort had been canceled, Novell published the long-awaited DR DOS 7.0 as Novell DOS 7 (BDOS 7.2) in 1994. Besides many other additions in the areas of advanced memory and disk management and networking, Novell DOS 7 provided all of Novell&#x27;s underlying &quot;STDOS&quot; components of the DR DOS Panther and Vladivar projects except for the graphical Star Trek component itself, which had been jointly developed by Apple and Novell. Instead, TASKMGR provides a text mode interface to the underlying multitasker in EMM386, but the system also provides an API to allow third-party GUIs to take control. Microsoft Windows, ViewMAX 2 and 3, and PC/GEOS / NewDeal are known to utilize this interface, when run on Novell DOS 7 (or its successors OpenDOS 7.01 or DR-DOS 7.02 and higher), and Star Trek would have been yet another one. In fact, some additional hooks had been implemented specifically for the Star Trek GUI for frame buffer access. These hooks have never been stripped out of EMM386 but just left undocumented.

Apple reused some of the platform abstraction technology developed for Star Trek, incorporating it into the concurrently developed migration to the PowerPC architecture. This abstraction technology includes the capability of loading the Macintosh ROM data from a file instead of from a ROM chip. Loading the Mac OS ROM file was first used in the original iMac as a CHRP New World ROM system.

Former Star Trek team members Fred Monroe and Fred Huxham formed the company Fredlabs, Inc. In January 1997, the company released VirtualMac, a Mac OS application compatibility virtual machine for BeOS.

In August 1994, Apple announced another partnership with Novell, this time to port its network operating system NetWare to run on Power Macintosh servers. However, the project did not exit the testing phase, and was quietly cancelled in October 1995.

==Similar concepts==

===Within Apple===
Apple&#x27;s first and quickly aborted concept of porting its flagship operating system to Intel systems was in 1985, following the exit of Steve Jobs. Apple did not reattempt this effort until Star Trek, and did not launch such a product until 2006.

Apple has actually shipped products based upon the concept of hybridizing System 7 into a shell application platform. It was accomplished in the form of the codice_4 process and other hybridized applications launched atop its UNIX-based A/UX system. It was also accomplished in the form of the Macintosh Application Environment (MAE), which was the functional equivalent of Star Trek plus an embedded 68k emulator (as was the case with System 7 for Power Macintosh), running as an application for Solaris and HP/UX. Apple also delivered its &quot;DOS compatible&quot; models of Macs, which is a hybridized Mac with a concurrently functional Intel coprocessor card inside. System 7 and later have always had DOS filesystem compatibility.

Although a direct x86 port of the classic Mac OS was never released to the public, determined users could make Apple&#x27;s retail OS run upon non-Mac computers through emulation. The development of these emulation environments was said to have been inspired by the initiative shown in the Star Trek project. Two of the more popular 68k Macintosh emulators are vMac and Basilisk II, and a PowerPC Macintosh emulator is SheepShaver; each are written by third parties.

Ten years after Project Star Trek, it became possible to natively run Darwin, the Unix-based core of Mac OS X, on the x86 platform by virtue of its NeXTstep foundation. This port was widely available because Darwin was open source under the Apple Public Source License. However, the Mac OS X graphical user interface, named Aqua, was proprietary. It was not included with Darwin, which depended on other window managers running on X11 for graphical interfaces, and thus most commercial Mac OS applications cannot run natively on Darwin alone.

Apple ran a similar project to Star Trek for Mac OS X, called Marklar, later referred to by Steve Jobs as having been the &quot;secret double life&quot; of the publicly Power PC-only Mac OS. This project was to retain OPENSTEP&#x27;s x86 port, keeping Mac OS X and all supporting applications (including iLife and Xcode) running on the x86 architecture as well as that of the PowerPC. Marklar was publicly revealed by Apple&#x27;s CEO Steve Jobs in June 2005 when he announced the Macintosh transition to Intel processors starting in 2006.

===Within IBM===
Comparing and contrasting with Apple&#x27;s efforts, IBM had long since attempted a different strategy to provide the same essential goal of innovating a new software platform upon commodity hardware, while nondestructively preserving existing legacy installations of MS-DOS heritage. However, its strategy was based upon its OS/2 operating system, which had long since achieved seamless backward compatibility with DOS applications. In 1992, roughly coinciding with the timeframe of the Star Trek project, IBM devised a new and fundamentally integral subsystem for backward compatibility with Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1 applications. This new subsystem for OS/2, called Win-OS/2, was integrated beginning with OS/2 2.0. Although conceived through different legacy business requirements and cultures, Win-OS/2 was designed with similar software engineering objectives and virtualization techniques as was Star Trek. Coincidentally, IBM had also code-named its OS/2 releases with &quot;Star Trek&quot; themes, and would eventually make such references integral to OS/2&#x27;s public brand beginning with OS/2 Warp.

Apple and IBM have attempted several proprietary cross-platform collaborations, including the unreleased port of QuickTime to OS/2, the significant traction of the OpenDoc software framework, the AIM alliance, Kaleida Labs, and Taligent. Both companies have utilized actual personnel from the Star Trek television and movie franchise for promotional purposes.
===Others===
A corporation formerly known as ARDI developed a product called Executor, which can run a compatible selection of 68k Macintosh applications, and is hosted upon either the DOS or Linux operating systems on an 386-compatible CPU. Executor is a cleanroom reimplementation of the Macintosh Toolbox and versions 6 and 7 of the operating system, and an integrated 68k CPU emulator called Syn68k. Liken from Andataco, for Sun and HP workstations, emulates the Macintosh hardware environment including the 68k CPU, upon which the user must install System 6.0.7. Quorum Software Systems made two apps targeting UNIX workstations: Equal provides binary compatibility by emulating the Mac APIs and 68k CPU, to put each precertified Mac app into its own X window, on Sun and SGI workstations; Latitude provides a source code porting layer with a Display Postscript driver.

<doc id="556560" wikidata="Q5949633" url="?curid=556560" title="Hussam Abdo">
<text>Hussam Muhammad Bilal Abdo (Arabic: حسام محمد بلال عبده; born 24 February 1990) is a Palestinian from the Masahiya area of Nablus, who, as a teenager, made international headlines on 24 March 2004, when he entered the Hawara Checkpoint in the West Bank, with eight kilos (18 lbs) of explosives strapped to his body as part of a suicide attack attempt.

==The incident==
Abdo, then reportedly aged 14, approached the checkpoint running towards the soldiers, wearing 8 kilograms (18 lbs) of explosives on a vest with the activation switch in his hands. When the Israeli soldiers noticed something suspicious about the boy, they directed their weapons at him and he became startled and raised his arms without detonating the belt. He was then ordered to raise his shirt and the explosives belt was discovered. After all the people were ordered to safety, a specialized Bomb disposal robot was sent to him with a pair of scissors, so that he could cut off the explosives, all the while telling soldiers that he did not want to die. He was then searched for more bombs but none were found and the bomb taken from Abdo&#x27;s vest was later exploded at a safe area. The commanding officer at the checkpoint noted that it is possible that the boy tried to activate the explosive belt but that &quot;it did not work&quot;.

Media reported that Abdo said he was offered 100 NIS and promised sex with the promised virgins and Israeli security forces added that in the inquiry it was found that Abdo was unpopular among his fellow students and that his friends would mock him. Fatah&#x27;s military wing of Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades from the Balata refugee camp in Nablus took responsibility for the sending of the boy.

When asked on Israeli television to give the reason for his attempted attack, Abdo said &quot;because of the people&quot;. When this was repeated back to him in the form of a question, he responded, &quot;they don&#x27;t love me&quot;. He was then asked by a reporter if he also thought about paradise, and nodded his head. &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; quoted Hussam as saying his handlers told him that blowing himself up is the only chance he&#x27;d have at sex with 72 virgins in the Garden of Eden.

&quot;The Age&quot; reported that Hussam said, in an interview, that after years of bullying by classmates, he wanted to reach the paradise he had learned about in Islamic teachings.

==Interviews==
In July 2004, the BBC was allowed an interview with Abdo in an Israeli jail in which he detailed the trail of mission. He said he was recruited by his friend Nasser, a 16-year-old classmate who approached him asking Abdo if he would find him a &quot;martyr bomber&quot;, to which Abdo replied he&#x27;ll do it. Abdo was then taken to Wael, a 21-year-old member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades who took him to a third militant who put the bomb belt on the boy and both took pictures of him. Abdo described his feelings towards the people who sent him as &#x27;normal&#x27; and noted that one of them is also in prison and that they are friends. When asked about the reasons for the attack, Abdo stated it was because his friend was killed and also because he desired to be relieved of school.

In the documentary &quot;The Making of a Martyr&quot;, Abdo was interviewed a year and a half after his attempted suicide bombing. He expressed no remorse and in fact seemed closer to the terrorists with whom he was incarcerated. He regretted not being in an explosion and remembered his failed attempt with joy, saying &quot;When they drove me to the checkpoint, I was giggling and jumping.&quot;

==Family report==
Abdo&#x27;s mother, Tamam, said &quot;He&#x27;s a small child who can&#x27;t even look after himself. He&#x27;s only 16 . . . He never had a happy childhood. He still hasn&#x27;t seen anything in life. If he was over 18, that would have been possible, and I might even encourage him to do it. But it&#x27;s impossible for a child his age to do it.&quot; Israeli media described Abdo as a &quot;mentally challenged&quot; boy while his brother, Hosni, said that Abdo &quot;has the intelligence of a 12 year old.&quot; His family criticized the Israeli Defense Forces for &quot;parading&quot; the boy in front of international reporters. Abdo&#x27;s uncle Khalil said that if he found out who sent his nephew out as a suicide bomber, he&#x27;d gladly kill the dispatcher himself.

==Media coverage==
Abdo&#x27;s story, and that of the child suicide bombing phenomenon in the Palestinian Territories, was captured in the award-winning documentary, &quot;The Making of A Martyr&quot;, by Brooke Goldstein and Alistair Leyland.

Husam was interviewed by Pierre Rehov for making of his documentary &quot;Suicide Killers&quot; where Rehov studies the psychopathology behind Muslim terrorism, and why some Muslim parents are willing to offer their children as martyrs.

According to Shafiq Masalha, a clinical psychologist who teaches at Tel Aviv University&#x27;s education program, 15% of Palestinian children dream of becoming suicide bombers. According to Eyad Sarraj, Palestinian psychiatrist and director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program, a survey his group made found that 36% of Palestinians over 12 aspired to die &quot;a martyr&#x27;s death&quot; fighting Israel.

<text>Neal Joseph Conan III (November 26, 1949August 10, 2021) was an American radio journalist, producer, editor, and correspondent. He worked for National Public Radio for more than 36 years and was the senior host of its talk show &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;. Conan hosted &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; from 2001 to June 27, 2013, when the program was discontinued; with the discontinuation NPR announced that Conan would depart the network.
