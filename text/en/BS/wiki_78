<text>James Thurston Nabors (June 12, 1930 – November 30, 2017) was an American actor, singer, and comedian, widely known for his signature character, Gomer Pyle.

Nabors was discovered by Andy Griffith while working at a Santa Monica nightclub, and he later joined &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, where he played the good-natured, unsophisticated Gomer Pyle. The character proved so popular that Nabors was given his own successful spin-off show, &quot;Gomer Pyle – USMC&quot;

Nabors also became a popular guest on variety shows that showcased his rich baritone singing voice in the 1960s and 1970s. He was the featured guest on every season premiere of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and he had two specials of his own in 1969 and 1974. He signed a recording contract with Columbia Records in 1965 and subsequently recorded numerous albums and singles, most of them containing romantic ballads. He recorded for Ranwood Records during the late 1970s.

Nabors was also known for singing &quot;Back Home Again in Indiana&quot; before the start of the Indianapolis 500, held annually on the Memorial Day weekend. He sang the unofficial Indiana anthem almost every year from 1972 to 2014, except for occasional absences due to illness or scheduling conflicts.

==Early life and career==
Nabors was born in Sylacauga, Alabama, on June 12, 1930, to Fred Nabors, a police officer, and Mavis Pearl (née Newman). He had two older sisters, Freddie and Annie Ruth. He sang for his high school and church. Later, he attended the University of Alabama, where he began acting in skits. While at Alabama, he became a member of Delta Tau Delta International Fraternity. After graduating, he moved to New York City, where he worked as a typist for the United Nations; after a year, he moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he got his first job in television as a film cutter at NBC affiliate WRGP-TV (now WRCB-TV) and was also a substitute co-host on the show &quot;Holiday for Housewives&quot;.

Because of his asthma, Nabors moved to Los Angeles and continued his work as a film cutter, this time for NBC. He also worked at a Santa Monica tavern, The Horn, singing and acting in cabaret theater. His act featured him as a character similar to the later Gomer Pyle. He sang in a baritone and sometimes spoke and sang in his higher-pitched comedic voice. At the club, comedian Bill Dana saw Nabors&#x27; act and invited him to appear on &quot;The Steve Allen Show.&quot; Nabors signed on to the show, but it was soon canceled.

==Career==
===Breakthrough and popularity===

Nabors made his television debut as &quot;Jimmy Nabors&quot; on the &quot;Today in Dixie&quot; show on WJBF in Augusta, Georgia. He was active in the choir at Grace United Methodist Church in North Augusta.

Andy Griffith discovered Nabors at The Horn and hired him to play a one-shot role of Gomer Pyle, a dimwitted gas station attendant on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; in the third season episode &quot;Man in a Hurry.&quot; Nabors&#x27; character was based on his act at The Horn, and it became so popular that he was made a regular on the show and was later given the spin-off show &quot;Gomer Pyle – USMC&quot;, in which his character joined the Marines. The show placed Nabors&#x27; bungling, naive character opposite Gunnery Sergeant Vince Carter (Frank Sutton).

&quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; remained popular despite the concurrence of the Vietnam War because the show avoided war-related themes and instead focused on the character&#x27;s rural roots and the relationship between Pyle and Carter. Nabors resigned from &quot;Gomer Pyle – USMC&quot; after five seasons because he wanted to move on to something else, &quot;reach for another rung on the ladder, either up or down.&quot;

===Singing career===
Nabors first revealed his fine singing voice on the February 24, 1964, &quot;The Song Festers&quot; episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and on April 8, 1964, on &quot;The Danny Kaye Show,&quot; and subsequently capitalized on it with numerous successful recordings and live performances. Most of the songs were romantic ballads, though he sang pop, gospel, and country songs as well.

The climactic vocal performance on &quot;Gomer Pyle – USMC&quot; came in an episode titled &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, aired November 3, 1967, in which Pyle sang &quot;The Impossible Dream (The Quest)&quot; in Washington, D.C., at a U.S. Navy relief show, accompanied by the Marine Band. A clip from the show, in which Pyle says the tag-line &quot;Surprise, surprise, surprise!&quot; appears in the Pink Floyd album &quot;The Wall&quot; in the song &quot;Nobody Home&quot;. He hosted a variety show, &quot;The Jim Nabors Hour&quot; (1969–1971), which featured his &quot;Gomer Pyle&quot; co-stars Ronnie Schell and Frank Sutton. Despite a poor critical reception, the show was popular and earned an Emmy nomination. After the cancellation of &quot;The Jim Nabors Hour,&quot; Nabors embarked on a nationwide roadshow.

===Later career===
Typecast from his role as Gomer Pyle, Nabors found his subsequent roles mostly comedic. In the 1970s, he appeared in the children&#x27;s television program &quot;The Krofft Supershow&quot;. He appeared in every season premiere of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show,&quot; because Burnett considered him a &quot;good-luck charm&quot;. They were so close that he became the godfather to her daughter Jody.

In a 1973 episode of &quot;The Rookies,&quot; he played his first dramatic role, a man called on to be an assassin after the death of his sister. Also in 1973, Nabors sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; before Game One of the Major League Baseball World Series. From 1977 to 1978, Nabors hosted another variety show, &quot;The Jim Nabors Show.&quot; Though the show lasted only one season, Nabors was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host or Hostess in a Talk, Service or Variety Series.

Nabors eventually grew tired of the &quot;prime-time TV grind&quot; and abandoned television jobs for nightclub and concert engagements and a role in a touring production of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;. However, Sid and Marty Krofft persuaded Nabors to star in the Saturday-morning children&#x27;s television show &quot;The Lost Saucer,&quot; about two bumbling androids, Fi (Ruth Buzzi) and Fum (Nabors), who travel through time with two children. Nabors, whose character was described as a &quot;Gomer Pyle in outer space&quot;, sang in a few of the episodes. He also guest-starred on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (season 1, episode 6).

In the 1980s, Nabors appeared in three feature-length films starring his friend Burt Reynolds, at the latter&#x27;s request. In &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (1982), about a sheriff (Reynolds) who falls in love with a brothel madam (Dolly Parton), Nabors played Deputy Fred, a character similar to Gomer Pyle. Though the film received mostly unfavorable reviews, Nabors garnered some positive comments for his performance.

In 1983, Nabors played an auto mechanic in &quot;Stroker Ace,&quot; starring Burt Reynolds as a NASCAR race car driver who has a contentious relationship with his team owner, a fried-chicken fast-food chain entrepreneur. The film was panned, and Nabors earned a Golden Raspberry Award for his performance. In Reynolds&#x27; star-studded &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot; (1984), about a cross-country car chase, Nabors made a cameo appearance alongside such celebrities as Dom DeLuise, Jackie Chan, Shirley MacLaine, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, and &quot;Andy Griffith Show&quot; co-stars Don Knotts and George Lindsey. Like the two previous Reynolds films Nabors appeared in, &quot;Cannonball&quot; received mostly negative reviews.

In 1986, Nabors returned to television, reprising his role as Gomer Pyle in the television movie &quot;Return to Mayberry,&quot; in which the cast of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; reunited. Also in 1986, Nabors starred in the half-hour comedy pilot &quot;Sylvan in Paradise&quot; as the title character, Sylvan Sprayberry, an accident-prone bell captain at a Hawaiian hotel. The series was not picked up by NBC.
After moving to Hawaii from Bel Air, California, with his partner Stan Cadwallader in 1976, he launched a show, &quot;The Jim Nabors Polynesian Extravaganza&quot; at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which ran for two years. Nabors eventually experienced &quot;bright-light burnout&quot; and disappeared from the stage, save for an occasional performance. In 1984, after a five-year hiatus, Nabors returned to performing, starring in the &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; show at the Las Vegas Hilton and other shows in Reno and Las Vegas. In 1982, he made his theatrical debut as Harold Hill in &quot;The Music Man&quot; with Florence Henderson at the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre in Jupiter, Florida.

In 1994, Nabors suffered from a near-fatal case of hepatitis B. According to Nabors, he contracted the disease while traveling in India; he shaved with a straight razor and &quot;whacked [his] face all up.&quot; The disease caused liver failure, and Nabors was given a dim prognosis; however, his friend Carol Burnett contacted the head of the liver transplant division at the University of California, Los Angeles, and gave Nabors the information. Nabors later became involved with the American Liver Foundation as a result of his experience.

Shortly after recovering from his transplant, Nabors embarked on another tour, with stops in Phoenix, St. Louis, and Washington. From 1997 to 2006, Nabors starred in the Burton White-produced &quot;A Merry Christmas with Friends and Nabors,&quot; a live performance at the Hawaii Theatre Center in Honolulu. The production, featuring local and national artists, ran for 40 performances and was directed by Tom Hansen until Hansen&#x27;s death in 2006. The final performance run was directed by John Rampage and dedicated to Hansen.

===Retirement===
From 1972 to 2014, Nabors sang &quot;Back Home Again in Indiana&quot; with the Purdue All-American Marching Band before each Indianapolis 500 race. In March 2014, Nabors announced that the 2014 Indianapolis 500 would be his final appearance, because health issues were limiting his ability to travel. After his retirement from this role, the singing of &quot;Back Home Again in Indiana&quot; was done on a rotating basis (as it had been before Nabors became the regular performer), before organizers named Chicago Blackhawks anthem singer Jim Cornelison as permanent replacement.

==Personal life==
Nabors began vacationing in Hawaii in the 1960s, and in 1976, moved from Bel Air, California, to Honolulu, Hawaii. For 25 years, he owned a macadamia plantation on Maui before selling it to the National Tropical Botanical Garden, a conservationist organization, though he still retained farming rights to the land and owned a second home on the property.
 He also owned a home and spent some summers in Whitefish, Montana, during the 1990s.

On January 15, 2013, Nabors married his partner of 38 years, Stan Cadwallader, at the Fairmont Olympic Hotel in Seattle, Washington, a month after same-sex marriage became legal in Washington. They had met in the 1970s, when Cadwallader was a fireman in Honolulu, and began dating in 1975. Although Nabors&#x27;s homosexuality was not widely known before this, it was also not completely secret. For example, Nabors brought his then-partner Cadwallader along to his Indy 500 performance in 1978.

===Alleged relationship with Rock Hudson===
A longstanding rumor maintains that Nabors married actor Rock Hudson in the early 1970s, shortly before Nabors began his relationship with Cadwallader.
Not only was same-sex marriage not legal anywhere in the United States at the time, but the two closeted gay actors were, according to each, never more than casual friends. According to Hudson, the story originated with a group of &quot;middle-aged homosexuals who live in Huntington Beach&quot;, who sent out joke invitations for their annual get-together. One year, the group invited its members to witness &quot;the marriage of Rock Hudson and Jim Nabors&quot;, at which Hudson would take the surname of Nabors&#x27; most famous character, Gomer Pyle, becoming &quot;Rock Pyle&quot;. The rumors spread, and because of this the two made sure they were never seen in public together.

==Death==
Nabors died at his Honolulu, Hawaii, home on November 30, 2017, aged 87.

The United States Marine Corps released a statement on Nabors: &quot;Semper Fi, Gomer Pyle. Rest in peace Jim Nabors, one of the few to ever be named an Honorary Marine.&quot; Second Lady of the United States and former First Lady of Indiana Karen Pence wrote on Twitter: &quot;So sad to hear about the passing of Jim Nabors. We heard him sing &#x27;Back Home Again in Indiana&#x27; at the Indianapolis 500 countless times. We will miss his beautiful voice.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Carol Burnett said she and Nabors were &quot;close friends for 52 years. ... My heart is heavy. I&#x27;m grateful he was a large part of my life. I miss him. I love him.&quot; IndyCar driver Tony Kanaan said &quot;Jim Nabors will always be the voice of &#x27;Back Home Again in Indiana&#x27;&quot;. Journalist Larry King said Nabors was a &quot;gentle man with immense talent&quot; while sending condolences to his family.

<text>Gleicheniales is an order of ferns in the subclass Polypodiidae (the leptosporangiate ferns). The Gleicheniales have records potentially as early as the Carboniferous, but the oldest unambiguous records date to the Permian.

==Description==
These ferns are characterized by root steles having 3–5 protoxylem poles and antheridia with 6–12 narrow, twisted or curved cells in their walls. Otherwise, their habitus is highly diverse, including plants with the typical fern fronds, others whose leaves resemble those of palm trees, and yet others again which have undivided leaves. They are tropical ferns, most diverse in Asia and the Pacific region.

==Classification==
In the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, the Gleicheniales were placed in class Polypodiopsida (the leptosporangiate ferns). Three families, Dipteridaceae, Gleicheniaceae, and Matoniaceae were recognized. The linear sequence of Christenhusz et al. (2011), intended for compatibility with the classification of Chase and Reveal (2009) which placed all land plants in Equisetopsida, reclassified Smith&#x27;s Polypodiopsida as subclass Polypodiidae and placed the Gleicheniales there. The circumscription of the order and its families was not changed, and that circumscription and placement in Polypodiidae has subsequently been followed in the classifications of Christenhusz and Chase (2014) and PPG I (2016).

The form taxon &quot;Microphyllopteris&quot; is used for some Mesozoic Gleicheniales that cannot be reliably assigned to the present-day orders. The Triassic &quot;Antarctipteris&quot; and &quot;Gleichenipteris&quot; are sometimes ascribed to the Gleicheniaceae, but are probably better considered Gleicheniales &quot;incertae sedis&quot;. The oldest possible members of the family are members of the genus &quot;Oligocarpia&quot; (reproductive organs) from the Carboniferous. However, these have alternatively been considered members of Sermayaceae. The oldest unambiguous records, belonging to the family Gleicheniaceae, are known from the Wuda Tuff flora of China, dating to the Asselian, approximately 298.34 million years ago.

In historical treatments, the order has sometimes been treated as a subclass Gleicheniatae of the Pteridopsida, with the taxa treated as families here upranked to orders, so that a distinct subclass can be established for the leptosporangiate ferns. In other treatments, they were expanded to include the filmy ferns (order Hymenophyllales), as well as the similar-looking genus &quot;Hymenophyllopsis&quot; (as order Hymenophyllopsidales). The resultant group was treated as class Gleichenopsida alongside the Pteridopsida, which would then be limited to the leptosporangiate ferns. However, this class is not monophyletic but rather a basal grade, retaining ancient traits among the living ferns. Irrespective of their modern taxonomic treatment, the Gleicheniales were formerly included in the order Polypodiales. But the ferns in the loose sense are much too diverse a group to be shoehorned into one taxon at such a low rank.

The following diagram shows the phylogeny of Gleicheniales.

<text>The A- and B-class destroyers were a group of 18 destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the late 1920s, with two additional ships built for the Royal Canadian Navy. The British ships were divided into two flotillas of eight destroyers, each with a flotilla leader.

==Design and description==
The A-class design was derived from the 1926 prototypes and for the 1927–28 Naval Construction Programme. The initial staff requirements were unrealistic and would have resulted in a much larger, unaffordable ship; they were scaled back, both to reduce the size of the ship and to save money. Nonetheless, the design had an improved gun armament, heavier torpedo armament, and greater range, at the cost of of speed, in comparison with the prototypes. The As were fitted with the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear and only had a residual anti-submarine ability while the Bs were equipped with Type 119 ASDIC (sonar) and had a full complement of depth charges, but could not use the TSDS. This was the beginning of the Admiralty&#x27;s policy of alternating TSDS and anti-submarine capabilities between destroyer flotillas. The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The A class had a metacentric height of at deep load. The ships&#x27; complement was 138 officers and ratings as built, but increased in size up to 162 during the war.

The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three water-tube boilers equipped with superheaters. Five of the As and all of the Bs had Admiralty three-drum boilers that operated at a pressure of and a temperature of while &quot;Ardent&quot; and &quot;Anthony&quot; were fitted with Yarrow boilers of pressure at the same temperature. &quot;Acheron&quot; was given experimental Thornycroft boilers that had a working pressure of and a temperature of to examine the weight and economy savings. Her specific fuel consumption was reduced from /hp/hour in her sisters to /hp/hour, although she was plagued by mechanical problems for her whole life. In the event the trials were inconclusive, and the Admiralty continued to use the lower-temperature and pressure Admiralty three-drum boiler until the of 1942, nearly ten years after other major navies began to use higher-pressure and temperature boilers. The turbines developed a total of for a designed speed of and the ship exceeded that during their sea trials. The destroyers carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at .

All of the ships had the same main armament, four quick-firing (QF) Mark IX guns in single mounts with enlarged gun shields, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Although the A class were intended to be equipped with gun mounts that could elevate up to 40°, and &#x27;B&#x27; gun on a high-angle mount capable of 60°, all four guns ultimately had a maximum elevation of 30°. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a range of . Each gun was provided with 190 rounds. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, the A- and B-class ships carried two QF two-pounder Mark II AA guns mounted on platforms between the funnels, each with 500 rounds. They were fitted with two quadruple mounts for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The A-class ships were initially going to be fitted with two throwers and four chutes for eight depth charges, but they interfered with the TSDS equipment so the throwers, one chute and two depth charges were removed. The Bs were equipped with two throwers and one rack for twenty depth charges. While not initially fitted with ASDIC, space was reserved for it, and at least some of the As received it beginning in the late 1930s.

The fire-control system for these ships was little advanced over their First World War-era predecessors. A pedestal-mounted, manually operated Destroyer Director Sight and a separate rangefinder positioned to its rear were situated above the bridge; the director transmitted training angles and firing impulses to the main guns, which fired at fixed elevations. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye. No fire-control computer was initially installed, but an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mark II was retrofitted after it had been proven in the subsequent C-class destroyers.

===Canadian ships===
The two Canadian ships (&quot;Saguenay&quot; and &quot;Skeena&quot;) were designed to be of a similar performance to the A-class ships to allow them to tactically combine. More flare was given to the bow to keep it drier and the forward part of the hull was strengthened to withstand ice. Their metacentric height was increased to allow for the build-up of ice and snow on the upperworks and they were shorter than their British counterparts. Although the ships had an additional of fuel, fewer horsepower and lacked superheaters for their boilers, they had the same range and speed as their brethren of the A and B classes. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships were built by John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company in Woolston, Hampshire and had the broad, slab-sided funnels characteristic of that builder.

===Flotilla leaders===
 was built to an enlarged design to accommodate the commander of the destroyer flotilla, Captain (D) and his staff, some 47 additional officers and ratings. The ship displaced roughly more than the private ships ( at standard load and at deep load); she was longer overall and had a beam wider. She shipped a fifth 4.7-inch gun between the funnels, which forced the two-pounders to be repositioned abaft the rear funnel, and was not fitted with TSDS. To compensate for her greater size, &quot;Codrington&quot;″s oil tanks were increased by and her turbines were rated at to give her the same range and speed as the private ships, but she proved to be significantly faster as she made during her sea trials. However, the increased length made her somewhat unhandy, having a turning circle much greater than the standard A class, which complicated manoeuvres with her flotilla.

Unlike &quot;Codrington&quot;, &quot;Keith&quot; was built upon the same hull as her sisters to save money and to make her tactically identical to her flotilla-mates. The initial proposal was to enlarge the aft deckhouse to make room for the Captain (D) and his staff at the expense of &#x27;Y&#x27; gun and the TSDS gear, but the gun was reinstated while she was under construction. The ship was too small to accommodate the entirety of the staff, and &quot;Blanche&quot; was fitted as a divisional leader to carry the surplus. &quot;Keith&quot; was heavier than the private ships at standard load and nearly heavier at full load ( and , respectively) and carried 19 additional officers and ratings.

===Wartime modifications===
The initial wartime modifications were limited and mostly related to the survivability of the crew, aside from the addition of 50 rounds per gun of 4.7-inch ammunition and the increase of depth charge stowage to 42 (the Canadian ships carried 33). Beginning in May 1940, the after bank of torpedo tubes was removed in most ships and replaced with a QF 20-cwt anti-aircraft gun, the after mast and funnel being cut down to improve the gun&#x27;s field of fire. Of the early war losses, only &quot;Codrington&quot; and &quot;Acheron&quot; received this modification before they were sunk. By October, all of the surviving A-class ships plus &quot;Beagle&quot;, &quot;Boadicea&quot;, &quot;Boreas&quot; and &quot;Brilliant&quot; had been modified and the rest of the Bs had received theirs by April 1941.

Beginning in 1941, most ships had &#x27;Y&#x27; gun and the TSDS gear replaced by racks and throwers for a pattern of 10 depth charges, with stowage increased to 70 charges. Their light AA armament was augmented by a pair of QF Oerlikon guns, one each abreast the bridge, and a Type 286 short-range, surface-search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force&#x27;s ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship. The Canadian ships replaced their two-pounders with a pair of quadruple machine guns and were not fitted with Oerlikons by 1942.

Late that year, some of the surviving ships were further modified into what became known as escort destroyers. These ships had either &#x27;A&#x27; or &#x27;B&#x27; gun replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. &quot;Achates&quot;, &quot;Beagle&quot;, &quot;Boreas&quot;, and &quot;Bulldog&quot; were among the first ships to be so converted. Around this same time many ships had their Destroyer Director Sight and rangefinder exchanged for a Type 271 target-indication radar. &quot;Beagle&quot; and &quot;Bulldog&quot; were later fitted with a two-pounder bow chaser to engage German E-boats in the English Channel while &quot;Boadicea&quot; received two elderly six-pounder (57 mm) Hotchkiss guns to deal with U-boats on the surface at close range.

Beginning in 1943, the three-inch gun was removed to allow for the installation of a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast; the aft torpedo tubes were sometimes reinstalled. The single 20 mm guns abreast the bridge were replaced by Mark V powered mountings for twin weapons later in the war, the singles replacing the two-pounder or .50 caliber guns amidships, with a further pair of Oerlikons that replaced the searchlight between the torpedo tubes.

==Ships==

===A-class ships===
===B-class ships===
==Service==
The class saw much service in the Second World War, being involved in convoy protection and anti-submarine warfare in home waters and the North Atlantic. Seven of the eleven ships of the class were sunk in World War II. and were sunk on 8 June 1940 while escorting the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Glorious&quot; by the German battleships and west of Narvik at the end of the Norwegian campaign. &quot;Codrington&quot; was sunk by German air attack at Dover on 27 July 1940. was sunk by a mine off the Isle of Wight on 17 December 1940. was sunk by two large German heavy cruisers, and &quot;Lützow&quot; while defending an Arctic convoy in the Battle of the Barents Sea. was so badly damaged when the ammunition ship blew up on 4 August 1943 at Algiers that she could not be repaired and was towed to Taranto and paid off. &quot;Skeena&quot; was wrecked in a storm off Iceland on 25 October 1944. &quot;Saguenay&quot; was heavily damaged in a collision with the merchant ship &quot;Azara&quot; and was consigned to the role of a training ship after being repaired.

The surviving ships were worn out from war duties and were scrapped soon after the war.

<doc id="555857" wikidata="Q2100881" url="?curid=555857" title="Poison Ivy (1992 film)">
<text>Poison Ivy is a 1992 American erotic thriller film directed by Katt Shea. It stars Drew Barrymore, Sara Gilbert, Tom Skerritt and Cheryl Ladd. The original music score is composed by David Michael Frank. The film was shot in Los Angeles.

It premiered at Sundance on January 21, 1992, where it was nominated for the Grand Jury prize of Best Film. Although it did not fare very well at the box office, grossing $1,829,804 with its limited theatrical release to 20 movie theaters, the film received favorable word-of-mouth, and became a success on cable and video in the mid-1990s. It has since gained status as a cult film, and is the first installment in a &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; film series that includes three direct-to-video sequels.

==Plot==
Sylvie Cooper is a student at an expensive private school. On the day she first meets Ivy, a poor street-smart girl, she witnesses her mercy-killing a badly wounded dog.

When they next meet, Sylvie&#x27;s father Darryl comes to pick her up, Ivy asks for a ride, and he reluctantly agrees. She sits in the front with him, puts her feet on the dashboard and deliberately shows him her legs by allowing her mini-skirt to fall back onto her hips, which Darryl notices.

A few weeks later, Sylvie invites Ivy home. She explains that Darryl adopted her and that her biological father is African-American. Sylvie also admits she once tried to kill herself. They meet Sylvie&#x27;s sickly mother, Georgie, whom Ivy wins over by talking about her scholarship and helping her unblock her oxygen tank.

Soon after, as both of Sylvie&#x27;s parents enjoy Ivy&#x27;s company, Ivy practically moves in. The girls share clothes and Sylvie&#x27;s bed. As they have similar figures, Georgie lends Ivy some of her clothes.

Darryl throws a party at the house to improve his failing career, and enlists Sylvie to help him. However, Ivy ensures that she must work on the night of the party, so she can assist Darryl. After the party, she dances with him in the kitchen and they embrace. Georgie walks in on them and storms upstairs.

Ivy apologizes, claiming that Darryl was under stress and she was only comforting him. Georgie believes her, accepts a glass of champagne drugged with sleeping pills, and falls asleep. Ivy sits on the bed next to her and begins to massage Darryl&#x27;s crotch with her foot. It is implied that he performs oral sex on her and she climaxes.

Over the next few days, Ivy continues changing her appearance, wearing Georgie&#x27;s clothing more often. Sylvie becomes increasingly irritated with Ivy&#x27;s growing presence in her family. Her anger reaches a breaking point when even her dog chooses Ivy over her, which is because Ivy has dog treats in her pockets.

Sylvie skips school to spend some time alone. Darryl picks Ivy up and drives them into the forest, where they drink and have sex.

The next morning, Georgie plays the cassette tape Sylvie made for her and walks out onto her balcony. Ivy walks up behind her, talks to her and without warning, pushes her off the balcony to her death. As Georgie is known to be mentally ill, and has threatened to commit suicide previously, Ivy is not suspected.

A few weeks later, Ivy talks Sylvie into taking out her mother&#x27;s sports car. When Sylvie becomes suspicious of her involvement in Georgie&#x27;s death, Ivy crashes the car, then moves the unconscious Sylvie into the driver&#x27;s seat.

In the hospital, Sylvie hallucinates that her mother visits her, inspiring her to return home to save her father from Ivy. When she arrives there is a raging storm, so she hurries inside, experiencing hallucinations the whole way. Once inside, she sees Darryl and Ivy having sex, and flees.

As Darryl hurries out to look for Sylvie, Ivy follows him. Accidentally showing the bruising on her chest from the steering wheel, revealing that she was behind the wheel, she claims that it was to protect him. As Darryl drives off to find Sylvie, Ivy goes up to Georgie&#x27;s old room. Playing the tape Sylvie made for Georgie, she wears Georgie&#x27;s robe and walks out to the balcony.

Sylvie sees Ivy and, because of her head injury, believes that it is her mother so makes her way to the balcony. Sylvie tells Georgie that she loves her and Georgie says she loves her too. When they kiss, Ivy begins to use her tongue, which breaks Sylvie out of her hallucination.

Ivy says Georgie wanted to die and now the three of them can be a family. Sylvie rejects her delusion, pushing her over the balcony. Ivy grabs onto her necklace in an attempt to take her with her, but she fails. As the chain breaks, a screaming Ivy falls to her death alone. Darryl returns to see Ivy&#x27;s corpse on the ground with Sylvie above.

The film ends with Sylvie narrating that she still loves and misses &quot;her&quot;, following the parallel between Ivy and Georgie.

==Cast==
==Production==
Producers Melissa Goddard and Peter Morgan brought the original idea to New Line. The studio then hired Katt Shea who had made a number of movies for Roger Corman; according to head of production Sara Risher, the studio wanted &quot;a teenage &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;&quot;.

The film developed greatly from this premise. There were three different drafts of the script and four different endings. According to Shea, the original ending had Ivy getting away with her crimes and hitch-hiking along a road. However, New Line insisted that Ivy be punished and made her shoot a new ending where Ivy died. New Line then wanted Shea to revive the character for sequels which the director refused to do; Shea now says she regrets the decision.

Shea says that she never regarded Ivy as villainous, but rather as a tragic character who just wants to be loved. She credits this for the film&#x27;s popularity.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival where, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, viewers were &quot;either enraptured or insulted&quot;. At the Seattle International Festival of Women Directors it was perceived to be politically incorrect. Shea stated:
I always told New Line it was going to be different from what they thought. I&#x27;m out to prove it&#x27;s possible to make a film that&#x27;s really artistic, that&#x27;s an honest expression that comes from me and that can still be commercial. I told them I can only make movies for myself. I just know that if I really love it there&#x27;s going to be a market for it.

On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 39% rating based on 33 reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;An unpleasant thriller that lacks the self-awareness to dilute its sordid undertones, &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; is liable to give audiences a rash.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 51 out of 100 based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Suicide, hints of lesbianism, murder, staged accidents and every other applicable melodramatic contrivance is dragged in. Unfortunate thesps take it all very seriously, while technical aspects are emptily polished.&quot;
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it 2.5 out of 4 and wrote &quot;Here the casting is so wrong that nothing quite works.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Katt Shea, who directed and co-wrote &quot;Poison Ivy,&quot; displays a gleeful enthusiasm for the B-movie genre to which her film essentially belongs, as well as a grasp of the form&#x27;s more delicate possibilities. &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; never resorts to overt malice when something more quietly sinister will do.&quot;

The character Ivy was ranked at number six on the list of the top 26 &quot;bad girls&quot; of all time by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

==Sequels==

&quot;Poison Ivy&quot; spawned three sequels: &quot;Poison Ivy II: Lily&quot; in 1996, &quot;Poison Ivy: The New Seduction&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Poison Ivy: The Secret Society&quot; in 2008.

<doc id="555863" wikidata="Q4310395" url="?curid=555863" title="Severed Dreams">
<text>&quot;Severed Dreams&quot; is an episode from the third season of the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. It won the 1997 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.

==Title==
Writer J. Michael Straczynski explains that the title refers to the separation of the Babylon 5 space station, referred to as &quot;a dream given form&quot; in the season 1 opening title narratives, from the Earth Alliance. He writes, &quot;If Babylon 5 was a dream given form, and the Earth Alliance had the potential to be something more than it has become, and the two part ways, then you have severed dreams.&quot;

==Plot==
After President Clark declares martial law, General Hague&#x27;s fleet of ships is attacked by Earth Alliance forces. Only Hague&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Alexander&quot;, survives, and travels to &quot;Babylon 5&quot; for repairs. Delenn brings Dr. Franklin to attend to a Minbari Ranger, injured while returning to the station with key information. The Minbari reports that the Shadows have engaged the Non-Aligned Worlds in civil and interplanetary wars, creating chaos. Delenn decides to see the Grey Council, angered by their ambivalent response to the situation.

When the &quot;Alexander&quot; arrives, Sheridan learns that General Hague was killed in an attack. His second-in-command, Major Ryan, has attempted to continue Hague&#x27;s resistance. President Clark orders the bombing of the Mars colony, which is resisting the martial law order. Hundreds of civilians are killed. The news network ISN, which has avoided broadcasting material critical of Clark, reports that the Proxima III and Orion VII colonies have seceded from the Earth Alliance. The television station is raided by Earth Alliance forces, terminating their broadcast. Another ship arrives, the &quot;Churchill&quot;, under Captain Sandra Hiroshi. She warns that the Earth Alliance is aware of the &quot;Alexander&quot;″s presence and ships are en route to seize control of the station. Sheridan enlists G&#x27;Kar&#x27;s Narn to augment his security forces under Garibaldi. Sheridan then announces &quot;Babylon 5&quot;″s secession from the Earth Alliance.

Delenn reaches the Grey Council. When they refuse to speak with her, she barges into their chamber and addresses them, warning that all of their prophecies have come to pass. She declares the Council broken and departs, supported by the worker and religious caste council members.

The Alliance ships &quot;Agrippa&quot; and &quot;Roanoke&quot; arrive, demanding the station&#x27;s surrender. A firefight breaks out. Garibaldi, his security forces, and the Narn stop a boarding party, incurring many Narn losses. The &quot;Churchill&quot; is critically damaged and Hiroshi uses the last of its power to ram the &quot;Roanoke&quot;, destroying both vessels. The combined forces of the station and &quot;Alexander&quot; destroy the &quot;Agrippa&quot;. As they assess the damage, more Earth Alliance ships arrive demanding &quot;Babylon 5&quot;″s surrender. Suddenly additional jump points open and Minbari warships arrive. Delenn warns the Earth Alliance ships that &quot;Babylon 5&quot; is under Minbari protection. The Earth Alliance ships withdraw.

As the station and &quot;Alexander&quot; complete repairs, Ryan states he will depart, hoping to split the Alliance&#x27;s attention. Ivanova leads Sheridan to the Zocalo, where the residents applaud Sheridan&#x27;s decision to have &quot;Babylon 5&quot; take a stand against Clark.

==Production==
Writer J. Michael Straczynski regards this episode as the final part in a 3-episode arc, following &quot;Messages from Earth&quot; and &quot;Point of No Return&quot;. Straczynski believes this episode blew the record for the number of individual scenes, having close to 140 scenes, as compared to &quot;the average TV script [which] has about 60–75 scenes or shots...&quot;. Within a short section of four pages of the script there were literally 100 CGI and live action shots.

Actor Robert Foxworth had been booked well in advance to appear in the episode as the rebel Earthforce leader, General Hague. However, Foxworth became double-booked, and filmed a similar character on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; instead. As a result, Straczynski killed off the character, with his lines being given to another character, Major Ryan.

Actor Jerry Doyle, playing Security Chief Michael Garibaldi, broke his right arm and right wrist during filming of combat scenes, his arm being seen bent in unusual directions as he releases his helmet.

The bridge set for the Earthforce destroyers was actually a redress of the set for the circular command observation dome on the Babylon 5 station. Platforms were placed over the pit areas to enable the actors to walk over these sections, and additional displays were added to the set. Clear displays with crewmembers on the far side of the screen were added to make the set appear larger and more intricate. These were merely plexiglass panels with tape applied.

The flame effects in the battle scenes were filmed in the parking lot, with a camera pointing upwards, filming through a plexiglass screen. One of the explosions was so big that it melted the plexiglass and the camera lens.

The lighting for the scene where Commander Ivanova&#x27;s fighter ship is tumbling was achieved by attaching a light to a gimbal, moving the light to match the pre-determined rotation of the fighter.

==Awards==
&quot;Severed Dreams&quot; was awarded the 1997 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, beating a number of major science fiction releases, including &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, &quot;Independence Day&quot; and &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;.

Her poems are widely anthologized, including the literary anthology, &quot;Under the Fifth Sun: Latino Writers from California&quot; (Heyday Books), and three anthologies of peace poems edited by Mary Rudge from Estuary Press. She has also translated two chapbooks from Peruvian poet Adrian Arias. She currently leads storytelling workshops at senior centers and elementary schools through Stagebridge.org. She is the former director of the San Francisco Poetry in the Schools program and the Bay Area&#x27;s Storytellers in the Schools program. A Latina activist for social justice, women&#x27;s rights, and the arts.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Serrano was born in 1934 in Weehawken, New Jersey to Ida and Joseph Serrano. She grew up in Latino and other immigrant communities in New York City. She trained in theater, studied anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and traveled with student peace groups to Soviet Russia and revolutionary China in the 1950s.

While raising her family and teaching, Nina has worked in theater, radio, and film. She helped make movies about Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba, about Salvador Allende&#x27;s Chile and Sandinista Nicaragua. In Cuba, in 1968, she met Salvadorean exiled poet Roque Dalton and they co-authored a TV drama about the folkloric Dalton Gang and saw it produced on Cuban television. This instantly made her a writer.

Returning to San Francisco, journalism, playwriting and poetry filled the early years of her development as an activist writer. She wrote a series of articles on the Los Siete trial and wrote poetry published in the San Francisco Good Times. In 1969, she joined Editorial Pocho Che, an activist publishing group of Latino poets. She wrote her first book of poetry, &quot;Heart Songs&quot;, during this period, and it was published in 1980. During the next three decades, she published her next books, &quot;Heart&#x27;s Journey: Selected Poems, 1980-1999&quot; and &quot;Heart Strong: Selected Poems 2000-2012&quot;, as well as appeared in many poetry anthologies. Through her friendships with Cuban poets, Nina began translating poetry, including her translations of Peruvian poet Adrian Arias. In 1982, she helped translate the Nicaraguan economic program of 1980, available as a bilingual edition from Estuary Press.

In 1972, she joined Communicacion Aztlan, writing and producing radio programs for KPFA. Over the next 20 years, in addition to her on-going radio work, she wrote and produced several stage plays, including &quot;The Story of the Chicken Made of Rags&quot;, &quot;The Story of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg&quot; and &quot;Weavings&quot;. She also wrote and produced film scripts, including Que Hacer? (What is to Be Done?), Después del terremoto (After the Earthquake), and Back from Nicaragua.

<doc id="555868" wikidata="Q1046880" url="?curid=555868" title="Cascade Tunnel">
<text>The Cascade Tunnel refers to two railroad tunnels, its original tunnel and its replacement, in the northwest United States, east of the Seattle metropolitan area in the Cascade Range of Washington, at Stevens Pass. It is approximately east of Everett, with both portals adjacent to Both single-track tunnels were constructed by the Great Northern Railway.

The first was in length and opened in 1900 to avoid problems caused by heavy winter snowfalls on the original line that had eight zig zags (switchbacks). The current tunnel is in length and entered service in early approximately south of and lower in elevation than the original. The present east portal is nearly east of the original and is at above sea level, below the pass. The tunnel connects Berne in Chelan County on its east with Scenic Hot Springs in King County on its west and is the longest railroad tunnel in the United States.

== History ==
===Original tunnel===
Construction began on the first tunnel on August 20, 1897, and was completed on December 20, 1900. The tunnel was long. John Frank Stevens was the principal engineer on the interim switchback route (opened in 1893, with grades up to 4 percent) and the first Cascade Tunnel. Stevens Pass, located above the tunnels, was named after him.

The tunnel had a fume problem from the coal-burning steam locomotives. It was built with a 1.7% (1:58.8) gradient eastbound, which was too close to the ruling gradient of 2.2%. Because of the steepness of the line, the locomotives had to pull hard to make the grade and thus burn more coal, which would lead to immense smoke in the bore. The tunnel was electrified, with the project completed on July 10, 1909, eliminating the problem. The unusual system used was three-phase AC, 6.6 kilovolts at 25 Hz, from a hydroelectric plant on the Wenatchee River just west of Leavenworth. The tunnel section only was electrified; or and 1.7 percent grade through the tunnel chamber.

The motive power for the section consisted of four GN boxcab locomotives supplied by the American Locomotive Company; they used electrical equipment from General Electric and were of and weighed each. Initially three locomotives were coupled together and hauled trains at a constant speed of , but when larger trains required four locomotives the motors were concatenated (cascade control), so that the speed was halved to to avoid overloading the power supply. The consulting engineer, Cary T. Hutchinson, published a detailed description of the system in 1909.
The tunnel was still plagued by snow slides in the area. On March 1, 1910, an avalanche at Wellington (renamed Tye after the disaster) near the west portal of the original Cascade Tunnel, killed 96-101 people, the deadliest avalanche disaster in U.S. history. This disaster prompted the construction of the current tunnel.

The old tunnel was abandoned in 1929, after the new longer and lower tunnel was opened. During the winter of 2007–2008, a section of the roof caved in and created a debris dam inside the tunnel, making it impassable to pedestrians due to standing water and ceiling debris. A warning was issued to stay clear of the western side of the old tunnel for a distance of for the indeterminate future.

===Current tunnel===
 
The new Cascade Tunnel was opened on January 12, 1929. The new line had or electrified, between Skykomish and Wenatchee. The ruling grade was still 2.2 percent, although of 2 percent or worse grade was eliminated. The line length was reduced by , and maximum elevation was lowered by from to .

The new tunnel was started in December 1925, and was built in just over three years by A. Guthrie of St. Paul, Minnesota; the aim was to finish by the winter of 1928–1929 so that further maintenance on deteriorating snow sheds could be avoided. Project manager and engineer Frederick Mears was assigned to make sure the project was completed.

While the new tunnel was being constructed, the Great Northern received delivery of five new electric locomotives. The new locomotives had a motor-generator supplying DC traction motors, and the single-phase AC supply required only one instead of two overhead conductors. Hence, the Great Northern re-electrified of the original route at single-phase (11 kV, 25 Hz) AC, including that were subsequently abandoned upon completion of the new tunnel, and used steam locomotives on the short remaining stretches of the old line.

On March 5, 1927, the three-phase electrification was abandoned, and the new locomotives were placed in service between Skykomish and the east portal of the old tunnel; the time was reduced from 4 hours for a eastbound train to 1 hour 45 minutes for a train. Furthermore, for the first time regenerated power could be used by another train or fed back to the utility company (power from regenerative braking was previously dissipated in a water rheostat at the power station).

Two years later, the new tunnel opened. It was the longest railroad tunnel in the Americas until 1989, when the Mount Macdonald Tunnel in British Columbia was completed, moving the Cascade into second place.

Electrification was removed in 1956, after a ventilation system was installed to eliminate diesel fumes.

On April 4, 1996 an eastbound freight train broke through the doors at the east portal after they did not open properly. There were no injuries, but the broken doors slowed operations for a couple of days while replacement doors were brought up from the Seattle area.


== Operations ==

The current Cascade Tunnel is in full operation and receives regular maintenance from BNSF Railway. The new alignment is a straight-line tunnel running between Berne and Scenic Hot Springs. It is currently part of the BNSF Scenic Subdivision between Seattle and Wenatchee, and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Empire Builder&quot; runs through it. Because of safety and ventilation issues, this tunnel is a limiting factor on how many trains the railroad can operate over this route from Seattle to Spokane. The current limit is 28 trains per day. Speed through the tunnel is for passenger trains, for freight trains.

The gradient in this tunnel is 1.565% (1:64), with the rise from west to east. The gradient is 2.2% on the west side from the town of Skykomish. Most recently, telecommunications assets and track sections inside the tunnel were improved.

===Ventilation operations===
Because of the length of the tunnel, an unusual system is used to ensure that the air inside remains breathable and reduce problems with excess fumes. As a train enters the west portal of the tunnel, a red-and-white-checkered door closes on the east portal and high-power fans blow in cool air through a second portal to help the diesel engines. As long as the train is within the tunnel, the fans work with reduced power to avoid pressure problems. When the train is to the tunnel exit, the door begins to open.

Once the train has cleared the tunnel, the door closes again and the fans operate for 20 to 30 minutes with maximum power to clear the tunnel of exhaust before the next train passes through. In the opposite direction, the door opens when the train is within . The fans are powered by two electric motors, clearing the air through the of tunnel within 20 minutes. Present-day train crews carry portable respirators for use in the event of a fan failure or a train stalling inside the tunnel. In addition, there are emergency/safety stations spaced apart, depending on the location within the tunnel, that provide additional air tanks and equipment to be used in the event of a ventilation/other failure.

The tunnel door is protected by an absolute signal near the east portal; on the west side, another signal with dual-flashing lunar aspects indicates to eastbound trains that the tunnel fans are operating.

<doc id="555876" wikidata="Q180563" url="?curid=555876" title="UEFA Euro 1996">
<text>The 1996 UEFA European Football Championship, commonly referred to as Euro 96, was the 10th UEFA European Championship, a quadrennial football tournament contested by European nations and organised by UEFA. It took place in England from 8 to 30 June 1996. It was the first European Championship to feature 16 finalists, following UEFA&#x27;s decision to expand the tournament from eight teams.

Matches were staged in eight cities and, although not all games were sold out, the tournament holds the European Championship&#x27;s second-highest aggregate attendance (1,276,000) and average per game (41,158) for the 16-team format, surpassed only in 2012. 

The tournament was the first European Championship where three points were awarded for a win during the qualification and finals group stages, as opposed to the old system of two points for a win, reflecting the growing use of this system in domestic leagues throughout the world during the previous decade.

Germany won the tournament, beating the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final with a golden goal from Oliver Bierhoff during extra time; this was the first major competition to be decided using this method. This was also Germany&#x27;s first major title won as a unified nation, adding to the two European Championship titles won by West Germany prior to reunification.

==Bid process==
At the time of the bidding process, it had not yet been confirmed that 16 teams would be participating. Instead, the bids were largely prepared as if hosting an eight-team tournament, meaning only four venues were due to be required. All candidates had to submit their plans by 10 December 1991.

The hosting of the event was contested by five bids: Austria, England, Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal. The English bid was selected by the UEFA Executive Committee at a meeting in Lisbon on 5 May 1992. In the year preceding the decision, the English FA had dropped plans to also bid for the 1998 World Cup in order to gain the support of other UEFA members who were planning to bid for that event.

==Summary==

===Group matches===
The hosts, England, drew 1–1 with Switzerland in the opening match of Group A when Alan Shearer&#x27;s 23rd-minute goal was cancelled out by a late Kubilay Türkyilmaz penalty kick. England defeated rivals Scotland 2–0 in their next game, and then produced one of their finest performances ever with a 4–1 win over the Netherlands. Patrick Kluivert&#x27;s late goal for the Netherlands secured his team second place in the group and ensured that Scotland would exit another major competition on goals scored.

Group B had Western European France and Spain, along with Balkan World Cup participants Romania and Bulgaria. France and Spain dominated the group, with France avenging Bulgaria for the 1994 qualification debacle, and World Cup quarter-finalists Romania going home, with no points and only one goal scored.

Groups C and D saw the Czech Republic and Croatia, whose national teams had only recently come into existence, qualify for the knockout stage. The Czechs lost to Germany, the eventual group winners, in their opener, but then defeated Italy and drew with Russia. Italy&#x27;s defeat meant they had to beat Germany in their final game to progress, but the World Cup finalists could only manage a 0–0 draw and were eliminated. In Group D, Croatia qualified for the quarter-finals, with wins over Turkey (1–0) and Denmark (3–0). The loss to the Croats ultimately sent the Danes, the surprise champions of 1992, home. Turkey became the first team since the introduction of a group stage to be eliminated without gaining a point or scoring a goal.

The other three quarter-finalists were Portugal (whose &quot;Golden Generation&quot; was competing at its first major tournament), Spain, and a France team featuring a young Zinedine Zidane.

===Quarter-finals and semi-finals===
The knockout stage was characterised by negative, defensive play; as a result, only nine goals were scored in the seven games and four of the matches were decided on penalties. The first quarter-final between the hosts and Spain ended goalless, after Spain had two goals disallowed and two claims for a penalty denied. The English progressed 4–2 on spot kicks. France and Netherlands also played out a 0–0 draw, with France winning the penalty shootout 5–4. Jürgen Klinsmann opened the scoring for Germany in their match against Croatia. A goal from Davor Šuker evened the score after 51 minutes, before Matthias Sammer of Germany scored eight minutes later, and the game ended 2–1 to Germany. Czech Republic progressed after beating Portugal 1–0.

The first semi-final, featuring France and Czech Republic, resulted in another 0–0 draw and penalties. Reynald Pedros was the one player to miss in the shootout, as Czech Republic won the penalty shoot-out 6–5. The other semi-final was a repeat of the 1990 World Cup semi-final between Germany and England. Alan Shearer headed in after three minutes to give his side the lead, but Stefan Kuntz evened the score less than 15 minutes later, and the score remained 1–1 after 90 minutes. In extra time, Paul Gascoigne came very close to scoring a golden goal, but fractionally missed a cross from Shearer in front of the empty goal, Darren Anderton hit the post, and Kuntz had a goal disallowed for pushing. Neither team was able to find a second goal. In penalties, both sides scored their first five kicks, but in the sixth round, Gareth Southgate had his penalty saved, allowing Andreas Möller to score the winning goal.

===Final match===
The final saw the Czech Republic hoping to repeat Euro 1976 when Czechoslovakia defeated West Germany; the Germans were aiming to win their third European Championship. Patrik Berger scored from a penalty in 59th minute to put the Czechs ahead. German substitute Oliver Bierhoff scored in the 73rd minute to make it 1–1. Five minutes into extra time, Bierhoff&#x27;s shot was mishandled by Czech goalkeeper Kouba and the ball ended up in the back of the net for the first golden goal in the history of the competition. Germany were European champions again, but for the first time as a unified country.

==Qualification==

On 30 November 1992, UEFA formally decided to expand the tournament to sixteen teams. UEFA cited the increased number of international teams following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and of Yugoslavia – rising from 33 UEFA members in 1988 to 48 by 1994 – as a driving factor behind the expansion. 47 teams eventually entered to compete for the fifteen remaining places in the finals, alongside hosts England.

The draw for the qualifying competition took place in Manchester on 22 January 1994. The teams were divided into eight groups, each containing either six or five teams. The qualifying process began in April 1994 and concluded in December 1995. At the end of the qualifying group stage in November 1995, the eight group winners qualified automatically, along with the six highest-ranked second-placed teams. The remaining two second-placed teams, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, contested a one-off play-off match in England to decide the final qualifier.

===Qualified teams===
With the extended format, three teams qualified for their first European Championship: Bulgaria, Switzerland, and Turkey. Croatia, the Czech Republic, and Russia competed independently for the first time since the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union respectively (although the Russian team is considered by FIFA to be the direct descendant of the Soviet Union and CIS teams that had appeared in six past tournaments and the Czech team is the descendant of the Czechoslovakia team). Seven of the eight participants at the previous tournament in 1992 were again present, with only Sweden – despite also having finished third in the World Cup two years earlier – missing out. Italy and Spain qualified after missing out Euro 1992 and Romania and Portugal after 12 years.

The following sixteen teams qualified for the finals:

===Final draw===
The draw for the final tournament took place on 17 December 1995 at the International Convention Centre in Birmingham. Only four teams were seeded: England (as hosts), Denmark (as holders), Spain and Germany (as the two highest ranked teams). The remaining twelve teams were all unseeded and could be drawn in any group.

Draw procedure:
# The unseeded teams were first drawn one by one without being revealed from Pot 2, and placed consecutively into four group bowls labelled I to IV. The teams drawn first, fifth and ninth were put into the Group I bowl; second, sixth and tenth were put into the Group II bowl; third, seventh and eleventh were put into the Group III bowl; and fourth, eighth and twelfth were put into the Group IV bowl.
# The team drawn first from each group bowl was placed into position 4 in their group; the team drawn second in position 3; and the team drawn third in position 2. 
# Finally, the four top-seeded teams were drawn from the separate Pot 1 bowl, and placed consecutively into position 1 of each group bowl. 
# Although it was decreed in advance ahead of the draw, that England&#x27;s group would be Group A (irrespective of their drawn group label), the remaining three groups then consecutively had the three remaining letters (B, C and D) drawn from yet another bowl to decide the letter name of their group, which also determined what venues they would play at.

The balls were drawn by UEFA figures Gerhard Aigner and Lennart Johansson.

The draw resulted in the following groups:

==Venues==
Since the implementation of the Taylor Report in 1990, following the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, England now had enough all-seater stadia of sufficient capacity to hold an expanded tournament due to the necessary stadium refurbishment by its leading clubs. The stadium capacities listed in the table are for the time of the tournament.

==Squads==
Each national team had to submit a squad of 22 players, three of whom must be goalkeepers.

==Finals format==
To accommodate the expansion from an 8-team finals tournament to 16 teams, the format was changed from that used in 1992 with the addition of two extra groups in the group stage, and an extra round in the knockout phases. The four groups (A to D) still contained four teams each, with the top two from each group still going through to the knockout phase. 8 teams then went into the new quarter-finals, ahead of the usual semi-finals and final, with 8 teams going out at the group stage. The format is exactly the one which was applied to the 1958, 1962, 1966 and 1970 World Cups, except for the absence of a third place play-off.

==Match ball==

A custom version of the Adidas Questra, the &quot;Questra Europa&quot;, was the official match ball of the championships. The design of the ball included a reworking of the England badge, and was the first coloured ball in a major football tournament.

==Match officials==
Match officials are listed in the two collapsed tables below.
==Group stage==
The teams finishing in the top two positions in each of the four groups progress to the quarter-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament. For the first time at a European Championship three points were awarded for a win, with one for a draw and a none for a defeat.

&quot;All times are local, BST (UTC+1).&quot;

===Tiebreakers===
For the first time in the history of the European Championship, the position of teams tied on points was decided by their head-to-head record, and not goal difference. If two or more teams finished level on points after completion of the group matches, the following tie-breakers were used to determine the final ranking:

# Higher number of points obtained in the matches played between the teams in question;
# Superior goal difference resulting from the matches played between the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points);
# Higher number of goals scored in the matches played between the teams in question (if more than two teams finish equal on points);
# If, after having applied criteria 1 to 3 to more than two teams, two teams still have an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 3 are reapplied exclusively to the matches between the two teams in question to determine the final rankings of the two teams. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, criteria 5 to 9 apply in the order given;
# Superior goal difference in all group matches;
# Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;
# Position using UEFA&#x27;s national team coefficient ranking system calculated using average points per game from: the Euro 1992 qualifying stage and final tournament, the 1994 World Cup qualifying stage and final tournament and the Euro 1996 qualifying stage.
# Fair play conduct of the teams (final tournament);
# Drawing of lots.

==Knockout stage==
The knockout stage was a single-elimination tournament with each round eliminating the losers. Any game that was undecided by the end of the regular 90 minutes, was followed by up to thirty minutes of extra time. For the first time in a major football competition, the golden goal system was applied, whereby the first team to score during the extra time would become the winner. If no goal was scored there would be a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. For the first time the final was won by a golden goal.

As with every tournament since UEFA Euro 1984, there was no third place play-off.

==Marketing==
===Slogan and theme songs===
The competition slogan was Football Comes Home reflecting that the sport&#x27;s rules were first standardised in the United Kingdom. UEFA President Lennart Johansson had said that the organisation had felt it was time to bring the event &quot;back to the motherland of football&quot;.

The slogan was incorporated into the competition&#x27;s most popular song: &quot;Three Lions&quot; recorded by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner with Britpop band the Lightning Seeds. Baddiel and Skinner were then strongly connected with football owing to their BBC show &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;. Released as a single, the song topped the UK Singles Chart for a total of two weeks. It was promoted by a video featuring the England squad.

The song was prominently sung by England fans during all their games, and was also chanted by the German team upon parading the trophy in Berlin after the tournament. It was even referenced by future Prime Minister Tony Blair in an address at the 1996 Labour Party Conference with the line: &quot;&quot;Seventeen years of hurt, never stopped us dreaming, Labour&#x27;s coming home&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Three Lions&quot; was the official song of the England team, and is the song most strongly connected with the tournament, however the official song of the tournament was &quot;We&#x27;re in This Together&quot; by Simply Red. The song was performed at the tournament&#x27;s opening ceremony.

===Merchandise and mascots===
The British Royal Mint issued a commemorative £2 coin in 1996, which featured a representation of a football, &quot;1996&quot; in the centre, and 16 small rings representing the 16 competing teams. Further special coins were only issued in the Isle of Man and Gibraltar.

The official mascot, &#x27;Goaliath&#x27;, was designed in a similar fashion to the original World Cup mascot from the 1966 World Cup. Goaliath comprised a lion, the image on the English team crest, dressed in an England football strip and football boots whilst holding a football under his right arm.

===Sponsorship===
===Video game===
A video game tie-in was developed by Gremlin Interactive for Windows, DOS, and the Sega Saturn. The Sega Saturn version was the subject of considerable media hype and was a major system-seller for the system in the United Kingdom.

==Controversies==

===Terrorist attack===
A terrorist attack took place in Manchester on 15 June, one day before the group stage match between Germany and Russia was due to take place in the same city. The detonation of a van bomb in the city centre injured 212 people and caused an estimated £700 million worth of damage. Four days after the blast, the Provisional Irish Republican Army issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.

The Manchester bombing was the first and so far only major terrorist attack in the host city of an ongoing UEFA European Championship. The scheduled match at Old Trafford on the day following the bombing went ahead as planned after the stadium had been heavily guarded overnight and carefully searched; the game, in which Germany defeated Russia 3–0, was watched by a near capacity crowd of 50,700.

===Empty seats===
The aggregate attendance of 1,276,000 and average attendance of 41,158 per game were the highest for the European Championship (in its 16-team format) until the 2012 tournament. However, these numbers were based on the number of tickets sold rather than the number of spectators in the ground, which was often significantly lower. The large number of empty seats in most of the games not involving England was blamed on a number of factors: a lack of travelling fans from most of the other nations concerned, a lack of interest among locals for games not involving England, kick-offs before 5:00pm that made it hard for children at school and adults at work to attend, steep ticket prices, and UEFA&#x27;s policy of only selling tickets in blocks (where each block consisted of a set from each of three price bands).

===Disorder===
After England&#x27;s defeat to Germany in the semi-finals, a large-scale riot took place in Trafalgar Square and the surrounding area. Further outbreaks of trouble occurred in the streets of several other towns. The police and German-made cars were targeted, with damage also caused to various other properties. A Russian student was stabbed in Brighton after attackers mistook him for being German.

Despite this outbreak, the tournament overall was free of hooliganism, helping rehabilitate England&#x27;s reputation after their fans&#x27; conduct during the previous decades. UEFA&#x27;s awarding of the tournament to England was in itself a further step in bringing the country back fully into the international fold, coming soon after their decision in 1990 to re-admit English clubs back into UEFA competitions after the indefinite ban issued to them following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.

<doc id="555881" wikidata="Q359385" url="?curid=555881" title="Innocence">
<text>Innocence is a lack of guilt, with respect to any kind of crime, or wrongdoing. In a legal context, innocence is the lack of legal guilt of an individual, with respect to a crime. In other contexts, it is a lack of experience.

==In relation to knowledge==
Innocence can imply lesser experience in either a relative view to social peers, or by an absolute comparison to a more common normative scale. In contrast to &quot;ignorance&quot;, it is generally viewed as a positive term, connoting an optimistic view of the world, in particular one where the lack of wrongdoing stems from a lack of knowledge, whereas wrongdoing comes from a lack of knowledge in children. Subjects such as crime and sexuality may be especially considered. This connotation may be connected with a popular false etymology explaining &quot;innocent&quot; as meaning &quot;not knowing&quot; (Latin — to know, learn). The actual etymology is from general negation prefix and the Latin , &quot;to harm&quot;.

People who lack the mental capacity to understand the nature of their acts may be regarded as innocent regardless of their behavior. From this meaning comes the usage of &quot;innocent&quot; as a noun to refer to a child under the age of reason, or a person, of any age, who is severely mentally disabled. 

Jean-Jacques Rousseau described &quot;childhood as a time of innocence&quot; where children are &quot;not-knowing&quot; and must reach the age of reason to become competent people in society. However, as technology advances, children in the contemporary world have a platform where they are referred to as &quot;digital natives&quot;, where they appear to be more knowledgeable in some areas than adults.

==Pejorative meaning==
&quot;Innocence&quot; can have a pejorative meaning, in cases where an assumed level of experience dictates common discourse or baseline qualifications for entry into another, different, social experience. Since experience is a prime factor in determining a person&#x27;s, innocence is often also used to imply naivety or lack of experience.

==Symbolism==
The lamb is a commonly used symbol of innocence. In Christianity, for example, Jesus is referred to as the &quot;Lamb of God&quot;, thus emphasizing his sinless nature. Other symbols of innocence include children, virgins, acacia branches (especially in Freemasonry), non-sexual nudity, songbirds, and the color white (biblical paintings and Hollywood films depict Jesus wearing a white tunic).

==Loss of innocence==

A &quot;loss of innocence&quot; is a common theme in fiction, pop culture, and realism. It is often seen as an integral part of coming of age. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a person&#x27;s life that leads to a greater awareness of evil, pain, and/or suffering in the world around them. Examples of this theme include songs like &quot;American Pie&quot;, poetry like William Blake&#x27;s collection Songs of Innocence and of Experience, novels like &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, and &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, and films like &quot;Viridiana&quot;, &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;, and &quot;Stand By Me&quot;.

By contrast, the &quot;I Ching&quot; urges a recovery of innocence the name given to Hexagram 25 and &quot;encourages you to &quot;actively practice innocence&quot;&quot;.

Innocence could also be viewed as a Westernized view of childhood, and the &quot;loss&quot; of innocence is simply a social construction or viewed as the dominant ideology. Thinkers such as Jean-Jaques Rousseau used the romanticism discourse as a way to separate children from adults. Ideas surrounding childhood and childhood innocence stem from this discourse.

==In psychoanalysis==
The psychoanalytic tradition is broadly divided between those (like Fairbairn and Winnicott) who saw the child as initially innocent, but liable to lose its innocence under the impact of stress or psychological trauma; and those (like Freud and Klein) who saw the child as &quot;developing&quot; innocence — maturing into it — as a result of surmounting the Oedipus complex and/or the depressive position.

More eclectically, Eric Berne saw the Child ego state, and its vocabulary, as reflecting three different possibilities: the clichés of conformity; the obscenities of revolt; and &quot;the sweet phrases of charming innocence&quot;. Christopher Bollas used the term &quot;Violent Innocence&quot; to describe a fixed and obdurate refusal to acknowledge the existence of an alternative viewpoint — something akin to what he calls &quot;the fascist construction, the outcome is to empty the mind of all opposition&quot;.

==Literary sidelights==
* In Doris Lessing&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Notebook&quot;, a woman looks back in laughing envy at the innocence that had previously allowed her to submerge herself in the position of the &quot;woman-in-love&quot;.
* Ivy Compton-Burnett had one character conclude dourly of another two that &quot;you are both of you innocent though it is an innocence rooted in your wishes for your own lives&quot;.

<text>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA; ) is a regulatory agency that is dedicated to the safeguarding of food, plants, and animals (FPA) in Canada, thus enhancing the health and well-being of Canada&#x27;s people, environment and economy. The agency is responsible to the Minister of Health.

The agency was created in April 1997 by the &quot;Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act&quot; for the purpose of consolidating the delivery of all federal food safety, animal health, and plant health regulatory programs in Canada. As such, the CFIA was established by combining and integrating the related inspection services of three separate federal government departments:

* Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada,
* Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and
* Health Canada.

==Role and responsibilities==
The agency is part of the larger federal public service. According to the CFIA statement of values, science is the basis for regulatory decisions, though the need to consider other factors is recognized. Through the enforcement of various acts and regulations, the CFIA works to protect Canadians from preventable health risks and provide a fair and effective food, animal and plant regulatory regime that supports competitive domestic and international markets. A CFIA technocrat is appointed to be Canada&#x27;s delegate on the FAO committee that drafts the Codex Alimentarius, which is a vital component of the WTO framework.

The CFIA is also responsible for monitoring pesticide residues in food. Health Canada establishes Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) for pesticide residues in all foods. MRLs are supposedly set for each pesticide-crop combination.

=== Agency officials ===
The Minister of Health is responsible for:

* establishing policies and standards for the safety and nutritional quality of food sold in Canada;
* the administration of those provisions of the Canadian &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot; that relate to public health, safety and nutrition; and
* for assessing the effectiveness of the Agency&#x27;s activities related to food safety.

The CFIA has had many Presidents over its lifetime:
* Paul Glover, was promoted in January 2019 to head Shared Services Canada.
* Dr. Siddika Mithani was appointed President on 25 February 2019.
* Dr. Harpreet S. Kochhar was appointed President in February 2023.
* Paul MacKinnon was appointed President of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, effective January 27, 2024.

The Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) of Canada, Dr. Mary-Jane Ireland, resides in the CFIA hierarchy. As a delegate to the OIE, the CVO commits the nation to observe the standards created by the international body, which standards in turn serve the WTO.

The Chief Food Safety Officer for Canada resides in the CFIA hierarchy, and plays a key leadership and advisory role for managing food safety incidents and for the development of policies, regulations and programs aimed at preventing and responding to food safety risks. Most recently, Isabelle Laberge was appointed to the role.

The Chief Plant Health Officer for Canada also resides in the CFIA hierarchy. The occupant of this position sits on the North American Plant Protection Organization and the International Plant Protection Convention, the latter of which informs the WTO&#x27;s Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. Dr. Anthony Anyia is appointed to this post.

The Chief Science Operating Officer, currently Dr. Primal Silva, is responsible for the CFIA&#x27;s 13 laboratories (one of which is Canada&#x27;s contribution to the BSL4ZNet: National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease) and sits on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development as well as the Global Coalition of Regulatory Science Research.

=== &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot; ===
One of the main acts and regulations that CFIA uses is the &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot;. There have been ongoing regulatory amendments brought forward with the most recent attempt at modernizing the &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot; was the introduction of Bill C-51.

Other Acts and Regulations also specify inspection requirements and for certain trade requirements, the need to register with CFIA to conduct business. Such companies are termed &quot;registered establishments&quot; as opposed to those &quot;non-federally registered establishments&quot; that fall solely under the &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot;. While the &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot; provide for core food safety standards, many companies opt to use third-party standards such as HACCP or ISO 22000 (which in any case incorporates HACCP) in order to meet client specified standards. Due to the race to globalize and the push to standardize it is no wonder that the Global Food Safety Initiative has been endorsed by the CFIA. All of these standards are closely observed by the food industry due to the potential loss of business. Here, the reader is encouraged to review the CFIA white paper &quot;Private Certification Policy (Food Safety)&quot;, which at some point between 2014 and 2020 replaced the &quot;Guide to Food Safety&quot;.

The &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot; does not have any requirements for domestic manufacturers to notify the agency of their existence but companies generally require provincial registrations or municipal licenses to operate. Provincial authorities and local public health units carry out inspections and work with the CFIA to manage food safety risks.

There is no requirement in the &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot; for importers to directly notify the CFIA of their existence. Import notification is required for other commodities such as fish and meat. All commercial importers must have an import/export account with Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) who refers food, animal and plant imports to the CFIA as required. Through various phytosanitary requirements, CBSA import controls often cause the CFIA to take notice.

===Power to recall===
The &quot;Food and Drugs Act&quot; does not provide the power to recall food products and all recalls are done on a voluntary basis. However, Section 19 of the &quot;Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act&quot; provides authority for the Minister of Agriculture to order a recall, where there are reasonable grounds that the product poses a risk to public, animal or plant health. CFIA rates their recalls in three classifications (see below). Public notification of Class I and sometimes class II recalls are done by the CFIA. Lower risk recalls are listed in a published database on the CFIA web site. Recall classifications are conducted by the Office of Food Safety and Recall based on risk advice from Health Canada.
*Class I is a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.
*Class II is a situation in which the use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.
*Class III is a situation in which the use of, or exposure to, a violative product is not likely to cause any adverse health consequences.

===Food Inspector corps===
The CFIA Food Inspector Corps. is unionized by the Agriculture Union, which in turn is an affiliate of PSAC.

On 11 May 2020, the embedded inspectors at slaughterhouses (as represented by the AU) said that CFIA management is &quot;threatening disciplinary action against employees who refuse to be reassigned to work at COVID-19-infected meat plants&quot;, while the intrepid journalist was keen to note that Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland had previously said that &quot;those who feel unsafe won&#x27;t be forced back to work.&quot;

===Research laboratories===
The CFIA houses 13 practical research facilities, among which are at least three containment laboratories, Fallowfield, Lethbridge, and the Winnipeg NCFAD:
*Charlottetown Laboratory – Plant
*Dartmouth – Food
*Saint-Hyacinthe – Food and animal health
*Longueuil – Food
*Carling, Ottawa – Food, animal health, and plant - Central Experimental Farm
*Fallowfield, Ottawa – Food, animal health, and plant
*Greater Toronto Area – Food 
*Winnipeg – Animal health/disease control - National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease
*Lethbridge – Animal health - National Centre for Animal Diseases
*Saskatoon – Food, plant and animal health
*Calgary – Food
*Burnaby – Food
*Sidney – Plant

==Incidents==
===2008 Outsourcing controversy===
In July 2008, CFIA biologist Luc Pomerleau was fired for disloyalty to the government, because he transmitted to his union a sensitive Treasury Board minutes document, in which President Vic Toews and ministers approved the cuts proposed by the Minister of Health Tony Clement that were to affect the inspection of animal feed mills, the certification of commercial seed, eliminate mandatory label registration of meat and processed products, the Avian Influenza Preparedness Program, and also called for the consolidation of three &quot;import service centres&quot; into one central facility. Pomerleau is no longer able to work for the government because he was deemed &quot;unreliable&quot; and fired for &quot;gross misconduct&quot;.

===August 2008 listeria outbreak===
According to the findings of the Independent Investigator that was appointed by the government following the 2008 Listeriosis outbreak, there were 75 confirmed cases of listeriosis and was also the underlying or contributing cause of death for 22 of these individuals. Although most cases were in Ontario, illnesses occurred in seven provinces. The report identified response actions that worked well at the federal and provincial levels and gaps in the system should be corrected. Canadian researcher Sylvain Charlebois published a separate report suggesting that the listeria outbreak forces the agency to accept that food recalls are no longer mainly externally oriented; they are systemic in nature.

===2012 brucella bacteria smuggling to China===
In October 2012, Canadian Food Inspection Agency scientist Dr. Klaus Nielsen was arrested, with 17 vials of brucella bacteria, headed to Ottawa airport, en route to China. Nielsen pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment. Wei Ling Yu, a fellow scientist, and Chinese national, fled from Canada. Both were fired from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

===2017 glyphosate residue tests===

In April 2017, it was reported that nearly a third of food samples in CFIA testing contain glyphosate residues. Glyphosate residues were detected in 29.7% of all food samples, with 1.3% containing residue levels above MRLs. For the grain products tested, 3.9% had residue levels about MRLs. The research focused on:
*482 samples of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables.
*2,497 samples of grains (barley, buckwheat, and quinoa), beverages, bean, pea, lentil, chickpea and soy products.
*209 retail samples of infant foods.

<doc id="555884" wikidata="Q918813" url="?curid=555884" title="British Basketball League">
<text>The British Basketball League (BBL) was a men&#x27;s professional basketball league in Great Britain. Since its establishment in 1987 the BBL represented the highest level of basketball competition within the United Kingdom. The organisation that operated the competition, Basketball League Limited, folded in July 2024 after the British Basketball Federation terminated its operating license. It was succeeded as the top-level men&#x27;s basketball competition with Super League Basketball.

The BBL operated as a franchise model where each member team is located within a separate franchise area. Most recently (in 2023/24), the League featured 10 member franchises from England and Scotland who jointly own the organisation and a chairman was elected by the teams to oversee operations. The League offices were located in Leicester where the country&#x27;s oldest team, the Leicester Riders, is also based.

The BBL sat above the English National Basketball League and the Scottish Basketball Championship, which effectively formed the second tier of basketball competition in Great Britain. Due to the franchise model there was no promotion or relegation between the lower leagues and the BBL, although several BBL member teams had previously competed in the National Basketball League.

In addition to the regular season Championship, the BBL also staged two knockout competitions; the BBL Trophy and the end-of-season BBL Playoffs. Previously the organisation also ran the BBL Cup and BBL Cup Winners&#x27; Cup competitions, though these were last contested in 2023 and 2009 respectively. In partnership with Basketball England the organisation launched a women&#x27;s league in 2014, branded as the Women&#x27;s British Basketball League (WBBL).

==History==
:&quot;See: List of British Basketball League seasons&quot;

===Origins and foundation===
Competitive national basketball in Great Britain has existed since 1936 when the Amateur Basket Ball Association (ABBA) founded the ABBA National Championship, a knockout competition featuring the regional champions from across England and Wales. An equivalent competition for Scotland was formed by the Amateur Basketball Association of Scotland in 1947. As fully amateur championships, the competitions were largely dominated by victorious teams from universities, YMCAs and Royal Air Force stations. A short-lived attempt at establishing a truly national league competition in the 1960s was met with some success; at its height the competition, known as the &#x27;Rosebowl&#x27;, featured 16 teams from across England, Scotland and Wales. In 1969, Scotland established its own national league with the ABBA following shortly after, with the formation of the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1972.

Over the next 15 years, basketball&#x27;s popularity in Great Britain grew steadily and annual revenues for the ABBA – renamed as the English Basket Ball Association (EBBA) in 1975 – increased from £23,440 in 1972 to £303,500 in 1981. With the increased commercial potential of basketball and the NBL evident, teams started to attract entrepreneurial owners and benefactors along with football clubs, such as Manchester United and Portsmouth, looking to replicate the multi-modal sporting club patented by European powerhouses such as Real Madrid and Barcelona. In 1982, the NBL reached a broadcasting deal with newly launched television channel Channel 4, further increasing the visibility of the league to a national audience. The NBL&#x27;s upward commercial trajectory continued with the EBBA signing sponsorship agreements with major national companies such as Prudential Insurance, Bell&#x27;s whisky and the Carlsberg Group, generating an estimated income of £1,196,000. A joint venture company, Basketball Marketing Limited, was established in 1982 by the EBBA and team owners to market the league collectively to potential sponsors and share revenue from TV contracts; with the agreement that 40% of revenue was held by the EBBA and the remaining 60% shared between all member teams.

In 1983, the Basketball Owners&#x27; Association (BOA) was established by owners of 9 different NBL teams to represent their interests as internal conflict arose regarding the financial relationship between them and the EBBA. Kevin Routledge, a director at Leicester Riders, claimed at the time that &quot;there was a feeling about men&#x27;s clubs that insufficient emphasis was being given to them, particularly recognising that in terms of spectator, sponsorship and media appeal they were very much top of the heap.&quot; The sentiment was echoed by Dave Elderkin, Manager of Sunderland 76ers, who noted that sponsorship revenue was divided between the EBBA&#x27;s 650 member clubs, and though the Division 1 teams generated the most sponsorship they were only receiving a small fraction of the return; Sunderland were reportedly paid just £2,000 from central sponsorship earnings in 1986.

By April 1986, still unsatisfied by the relationship with the EBBA, a contingent of team owners set forth to organise a breakaway competition, dubbed the British Basketball League. The initiative was led by John Deacon, owner of Portsmouth, who had rallied support for the new league from fellow teams Bracknell Pirates, Crystal Palace, Edinburgh, Hemel Hempstead &amp; Watford Royals, Kingston and Sunderland, with each team contributing a £5,000 entry fee. Not all teams were initially onboard with the new proposals however, as established names like Birmingham Bullets first rejected the move and opted to stay within the existing EBBA structure. The EBBA established a Committee of Inquiry to conduct a review and establish the terms of the handover, and a new organisation – the Basketball League Limited – was formed by the team owners to oversee the operations of the new competition.

The new organisation proposed commencing with a new 16-team league competition for the 1987–88 season, that would include the 13 existing teams of the NBL Division 1 along with two promoted teams from Division 2, plus Scottish champions Livingston and a possibility of future expansion into Scotland and Ireland. Some reports also suggested Wales-based Rhondda were approached as a potential addition. Additional proposals for the new league included prize money being awarded to competition winners, a new supplementary League Cup competition for member teams, and the removal of relegation between the new league and NBL Division 2 for the first two seasons, to encourage financial stability for its member teams; promotion would still be offered to the top two teams within Division 2, subject to financial and facility guarantees. Furthermore, all member teams within the Basketball League Limited would be equal shareholders of the new organisation and be eligible to compete in European competitions, whilst the EBBA would retain disciplinary powers, appointment of match officials and remain completely in control of other competitions, such as the National Cup.

Following the conclusion of the 1986–87 season, the EBBA signed a formal agreement with the Basketball League Limited, handing over full control and administration of the top national basketball competition to the new organisation. The agreement was signed at Old Trafford football stadium, home of Manchester United, whose basketball team would feature in the newly formed league. Signing the agreement to establish the new league was Keith Mitchell OBE and Mel Welch, President and Secretary of the EBBA respectively, along with John Deacon, Chairman of the Basketball League Limited, and John Barr, Treasurer of the new organisation.

At official launch, the 16 confirmed teams to feature in the new league were announced as:
*Birmingham
*Bolton &amp; Bury Giants
*Bracknell Tigers
*Brunel Crystal Palace
*Calderdale Explorers
*Derby Rams
*Hemel &amp; Watford Royals
*Kingston
*Leicester City Riders
*Livingston
*Manchester United
*Oldham Celtics
*Portsmouth
*Rhondda
*Solent Stars
*Sunderland 76ers
The new league faced challenges from the off-set when Rhondda – the league&#x27;s only Wales-based team – folded in August 1987, just weeks before the start of the new season. The sudden loss of a major sponsor meant the team were unable to finance the upcoming campaign, where they would compete against teams with budgets of up to £250,000. London-based Brunel Crystal Palace also faced similar financial challenges during the off-season, searching for additional sponsors to cover their £100,000 outgoings. Despite these setbacks, the fledging organisation did achieve some immediate commercial success; a new 3-year sponsorship agreement with the Carlsberg Group saw the new competition branded as the Carlsberg Basketball League, along with additional naming-rights deals for the postseason playoffs and the Tournament of Champions, both of which were also sponsored by Carlsberg. The newly-established League Cup competition was branded as the NatWest Bank Trophy following a deal with National Westminster Bank.

The EBBA&#x27;s player import rules – where teams were restricted to having two foreign &quot;import&quot; players plus one &quot;naturalised&quot; British player – were carried over to the new competition. A small complication arose as the league also featured Scotland-based Livingston, and the ruling meant that English players would count as foreign players for teams based in Scotland.

===Early years and Kingston dominance (1987–1992)===

The first game of the new Carlsberg Basketball League and the 1987–88 season took place on 13 September 1987, when Scotland-based Livingston defeated Oldham Celtics, 98–81, at the Forum Arena in Livingston. The former Scottish National League team went on to have a very successful season overall. Whilst Portsmouth were successful in retaining their national champions title in the inaugural league championship – continuing their success from the previous National Basketball League – they were soundly defeated by Livingston in both the Playoff Final (81–72) and NatWest Bank Trophy Final (96–91).

===Early growth (1992–2002)===
The 1990s also saw a growth in popularity and commercialism within the league. Games were televised and the league picked up sponsors such as Peugeot, Lego, Playboy and Budweiser, while attendances at games also increased. The Manchester Giants opened the 1995–96 season in front of a record 14,251 fans at the Nynex Arena against the London Leopards, a record crowd for a basketball game in Great Britain. It stood until 2006, when the NBA started staging games at the O2 Arena in London.

London clubs dominated the league, with London Towers, Crystal Palace and the Greater London Leopards all sharing success in the mid-1990s. In 1999, a Conference format similar to the NBA was introduced, with clubs split North and South. The two Conference champions met in a Championship series to decide the champions for the next three years.

===Tougher times (2002–2012)===
A single division format returned in 2002 and five different franchises won the Championship title in the five years after that. The new millennium, however, also saw a series of setbacks for the BBL. The collapse of ITV Digital cost the league financially, with many franchises struggling to recover from the lost revenue that the £21 million contract was providing. Long established franchises such as the Manchester Giants, Essex Leopards, Derby Storm, Thames Valley Tigers and Birmingham Bullets withdrew from the league, though new teams have been formed under the Giants and Leopards names. The membership crisis brought about the addition of new franchises such as Guildford Heat (formed by supporters of the defunct Thames Valley Tigers), and elected teams from the lower-tier English Basketball League, including the Plymouth Raiders. Both teams made a refreshing impact on the old boys, with the Heat qualifying for the Play-offs in their rookie season.

During the same season Newcastle won 30 of their 40 regular season league fixtures to clinch the Championship crown – the previous season saw the Eagles win 31 matches but lose out to Chester Jets in the final week, by just two points. That title was one of four pieces of silverware won during the dubbed &quot;clean-sweep&quot; season of 2005–06, the Eagles marching on to claim the BBL Cup, BBL Trophy and Playoff&#x27;s – the complete set.

===Resurgence, the 777 years, and current situation (2012–2024)===
The intervening years saw the perennial success of the Newcastle Eagles, the reemergence of the Leicester Riders as a dominant force in the domestic game, and the rise and fall of teams based in London, Birmingham, Liverpool, Essex, Durham and Worthing. Long term franchise Milton Keynes relocated to London, to become a 2012 Olympics legacy tenant at the Copper Box Arena, and a new incarnation of the famous Manchester Giants name re-entered the league in the same year.

The 2015 Playoffs Final took place at The O2 Arena, London, following a string of sell-out attendances at Wembley Arena between 2012 and 2014. The event saw a record breaking crowd of 14,700.

As of the 2016–17 BBL season Italian sportswear manufacturer Kappa have been the exclusive kit supplier for all teams, replacing a previous deal with Spalding.

The past decade has seen sustained growth across the league, with the biggest advances in facilities. Some clubs have now built their own venues, including Newcastle, Leicester, Sheffield and Caledonia, and Manchester, Cheshire and Surrey and have moved into much improved facilities, while Plymouth, and the most recent election from the EBL, the Bristol Flyers, have announced plans for their own arenas. The 2018–19 season saw, for the first time in 11 years, British participation in European competition when Leicester competed in the Basketball Champions League and FIBA Europe Cup.

On 2 December 2021 the Miami-based investment firm 777 Partners bought 45.5% of the shares of the league. The company invested £7 million in the league, that also saw an organisational reform which included the appointment of a CEO.

On 14 June 2024 British Basketball, the national governing body for basketball in the UK, terminated the league&#x27;s licence, meaning that the UK men&#x27;s professional league would no longer be run by the current operating company behind the BBL. British Basketball cited financial concerns as a principal driver of the decision, and promised that interim measures would be put in place to ensure that a 2024/25 season takes place.

# &quot;The Hemel &amp; Watford Royals, Leicester City Riders and Sunderland 76ers were all participants in the previous top-flight league, the NBL, when it changed administration to the BBL in 1987.&quot;
# &quot;The Cheshire Jets and Sheffield Sharks were both promoted from the NBL in 1991 and 1994 respectively.&quot;
# &quot;Bristol Flyers (2014) have acquired a franchise licence to compete in the BBL, having previously competed in the EBL.&quot;
===Expansion teams===
The most recent round of expansion took place in 2014 when the League admitted two teams, Bristol Flyers and Leeds Carnegie, into the organisation; an ill-fated application from a third team, Edinburgh-based East Scotland Warriors, was rejected at the final stages to concerns over its financial backing. Plymouth City Patriots were admitted into the League for the 2021–22 season as a direct replacement for the Plymouth Raiders, who withdrew prior to the season starting.

As of 2023, the League does not have any confirmed plans to introduce more teams in new cities or locations, however there are interested parties from Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Dublin, Leeds and Liverpool looking at establishing a potential expansion franchise. In 2022, media outlets also reported interest from a Birmingham-based consortium which included former NBA star and Hall of Famer, Hakeem Olajuwon, as well as additional interest from the city of Edinburgh and NBL powerhouse Reading Rockets. Of these interested cities, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Leeds and Liverpool have all, at some point in time, previously hosted a BBL team since 1987.

===Former teams===
==Corporate structure==
The league was an independent company owned by its member clubs and Miami-based investment firm 777 Partners, who bought 45.5% of the shares of the league, investing £7million, in December 2021.
Each club, or franchise, now had an equal shareholding of 5.45%. The 8-person management board is made up of an independent chairperson, non-affiliated non-executives, Investor Directors and a minority representation of BBL Club Directors. Sir Rodney Walker is the current elected chairperson.

On 14 June 2024 British Basketball, the national governing body for basketball in the UK, terminated the league&#x27;s licence citing financial concerns.

===Chairs===
* John Deacon (1987 to 1988)
* Kevin Routledge (1988 to 2002)
* Vince Macaulay (2002 to 2006)
* Paul Blake (2006 to 2013)
* Ed Percival (2013 to 2015)
* Sir Rodney Walker (2016 to 2024)

==Competitions==
===BBL Championship===

The BBL Championship is the flagship competition of the British Basketball League and features all member teams playing a double round robin (home and away) league season, from September through to April. Matches are played according to FIBA rules and games consist of four-quarters of 10 minutes each. Two points are awarded for a win, with overtime used if the score is tied at the final buzzer – unlimited numbers of 5-minute overtime periods are played until one team is ahead when a period ends. At the end of the regular season, the team with the most points is crowned as winners of the BBL Championship, and thus British Champions. If points are equal between two or more teams then head-to-head results between said teams are used to determine the winners. In the case of a tie between multiple teams where this does not break the tie, the winners are then determined by the points difference in the games between said teams. Following the completion of the Championship regular season, the top eight ranked teams advance into the post-season Playoffs which usually take place during April.

In the regular season, team schedules are not identical and neither are matchdays, with games scheduled mainly around venue availability. Because of this teams may find themselves playing a series of four or five home games consecutively followed by a straight set of away games. As the regular season is also particularly short many games are played over weekends as &#x27;doubleheaders&#x27;, whereby a team will play games (possibly a home and away game) on consecutive days, something that is not commonplace in British sports, although often seen in the National Basketball Association and other North American sports.

===Playoffs===
The post-season Playoffs usually takes place in April, featuring the top eight ranked teams from the Championship regular season compete in a knockout tournament. Teams are seeded depending on their final positioning in the Championship standings, so first-place faces eighth-place, second versus seventh-place, third against sixth-place and finally fourth plays the fifth-placed team. Both the Quarterfinals and the succeeding Semifinals are played over a three-game series, with the higher seed getting two home games either side of the lower seeds home game. The team that wins two of the three games advances to the next round. As with the Quarterfinals, teams in the Semifinals are also seeded, with the highest-ranking team drawn against the lowest-ranking team in one Semifinal and the two remaining teams drawn together in the other Semifinal. The culmination of the post-season is the grand Final, held at The O2 Arena in London, which sees the two Semi-final winners play a one-game event to determine the Playoff Champions.

===BBL Cup===

The BBL Cup emerged from a breakaway of the English Basketball Association-organised National Cup and was contested for the first time in the 2003–04 season, when Sheffield Sharks were the inaugural winners. Since the 2019–20 season, the competition has a group stage followed by a knockout stage. The group stage consists of the teams being split into north and south groups and within each playing a double round-robin system. The top 4 teams from each group are then seeded with 1st of each group playing 4th in the other and 3rd in each group playing 2nd in the other. The winner of the Aggregate score going through to the semi-final. The winner of the aggregate score of each match in the semi-final then goes through to the BBL Cup Final. The Cup final is played at the Arena Birmingham in Birmingham, usually in early January.

===BBL Trophy===

The BBL Trophy traces its origins back to a previous competition known as the Anglo-Scottish Cup – and subsequently the British Master&#x27;s Cup – which was founded in 1984 and was initially a competition between teams from both the English and Scottish leagues. Following the launch of the new British Basketball League administration in 1987 – who assumed control over the National Basketball League from the English Basketball Association – the British Master&#x27;s Cup was scrapped and replaced with the newly formed League Trophy. The Trophy competition has historically had a round-robin group stage format used for the first round, however the current competition is a knockout tournament with pairings drawn completely at random – there are no seeds, and a draw takes place after the majority of fixtures have been played in each round. As well as including all BBL member clubs, invited teams from the English Basketball League, and occasionally the Scottish Basketball League, often take part in the Trophy. The Final is usually played in March at a neutral venue.

===European Competition===
In 2018, the Leicester Riders competed in Europe&#x27;s third tier of continental basketball, the Basketball Champions League, losing in the first qualification round on aggregate to the Bakken Bears. They became the first British team to compete in European competition since the Guildford Heat featured in the ULEB Cup during the 2007–08 season.

Following their elimination from the Basketball Champions League, the Leicester Riders played in the 2018–19 FIBA Europe Cup, Europe&#x27;s fourth tier.

To be eligible for entry into the Basketball Champions League or the FIBA Europe Cup, teams must play in arenas with a capacity of at least 2,000 people.

==Players==
===Import players===
British Basketball League rules currently allow for each team to have a maximum of three &quot;import&quot; players – from outside of the European Union (EU) and require a work permit to play – whilst the remaining players on the roster must have citizenship of an EU country, either by birth or by naturalisation. The current ruling was integrated at the beginning of the 2006–07 season, reverting from the previous law which allowed for up to four non-EU players on a roster, along with naturalised players.

New rules introduced for the 2012–13 season allow teams to field a maximum of five non-British players per game (including up to three work permitted players), further demonstrating the League&#x27;s commitment towards developing British players.

===Salary cap===
Prior to the 2022–23 season, a &quot;Team Payments Cap&quot; limited teams to spend no more than £250,000 on player salaries per season with the aim of keeping overall costs down for the teams whilst also ensuring competitive balance. The Team Payments Cap was dropped in August 2022 as it was stated to hamper the growth of BBL teams playing in European competitions.

===Transfer regulations===
According to BBL rules, teams must field no more than six import (non-EU) players in any one season, though only three are allowed to be registered to a roster at any one time. Signings are allowed to be made throughout the pre-season and during the regular season until the league&#x27;s transfer deadline on 28 February, or if during a leap year, the date is 29 February.

==Media coverage==
Basketball receives little national press coverage in the United Kingdom, although coverage is more extensive from the local newspapers in cities where BBL clubs are based, with publications such as &quot;The Plymouth Herald&quot;, &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; and the &quot;Newcastle Chronicle&quot; all having dedicated basketball reporters who cover the respective local team. Some national newspapers list results and occasionally provide short summaries of the League&#x27;s news, but more extensive coverage remains minimal.

The history of television coverage of the BBL has been sporadic. Previously the League enjoyed coverage from Channel 4 in the 1980s and Sky Sports from 1995 to 2001, where audiences peaked at around 150,000 viewers. The League signed a three-year broadcast deal with the ill-fated digital TV company ITV Digital in 2001, and coverage suffered a sharp decline as the broadcaster struggled and eventually went out of business, resulting in a significant loss of income to member clubs. Television coverage was then infrequent until the 2007–08 season, when international broadcaster Setanta Sports signed a deal to screen one live game a week. In 2010, the League agreed a broadcast rights deal with Sky Sports, marking the return of BBL action on Sky Sports after a 9-year gap. The League&#x27;s own subscription-based online TV station, BBL TV, took over the broadcast of live games from 2013 to 2015, and during the 2013–14 season match highlights were also televised and featured on British Eurosport each week.

In July 2016, the league signed a two-year broadcast deal with the BBC, featuring both British Basketball League and Women&#x27;s British Basketball League games. The games would be broadcast on the BBC Sport website with the showpiece finals also being broadcast on the BBC Red Button. Alongside the BBC deal, a six-year deal with Perform was signed which saw every BBL game broadcast via LiveBasketball.TV, and a deal followed a year later with UNILAD to broadcast one game a week live via Facebook. FreeSports signed a deal with the league in January 2018 to broadcast games for the remainder of the season, starting with the BBL Cup Final between Worcester Wolves and Cheshire Phoenix.

In November 2020, coverage of the league returned to Sky Sports in a new two-year deal which sees Sky broadcasting 30 games per season, including BBL Trophy Final, BBL Cup Final and BBL Playoffs. This has been extended to cover the 2022/23 season.

During the 2023–24 season of the BBL, NESN aired BBL matches in the US.

<doc id="555886" wikidata="Q1277218" url="?curid=555886" title="Earl of Angus">
<text>The Mormaer or Earl of Angus was the ruler of the medieval Scottish province of Angus. The title, in the Peerage of Scotland, is held by the Duke of Hamilton, and is used as a courtesy title for the eldest son of the Duke&#x27;s eldest son.

==History==


===Mormaers===
Angus is one of the oldest attested mormaerdoms, with the earliest attested mormaer, Dubacan of Angus, known to have lived in the early 10th century, as recorded in the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot;. Angus was, according to the doubtful and legendary text &quot;de Situ Albanie&quot;, one of the seven original mormaerdoms of the Pictish kingdom of Alba, said to have been occupied by seven brothers, of whom Angus (Oengus) was the eldest. Despite this, the mormaers of Angus are among the most obscure of all. After the death of Mormaer Maol Chaluim, in probably about 1240, the mormaerdom passed through the marriage of his daughter Matilda, to the line of the Norman Gilbert de Umfraville.

===Ogilvy Earls===
The lands of Clan Ogilvy, in Angus, was ruled by a mormaer; one of the ancient Celtic nobles of Scotland who became the first earls. The title of Moramer of Angus became Earl of Angus. Gillebride, Earl of Angus, received a Barony from King William the Lion in 1163, and bestowed upon his son, Gilbert, the lands of Wester Powrie, Ogilvy, and Kyneithin. The top left quadrant displays the Ogilvy crest; argent, a lion passant, guardant, Gules, crowned with an imperial crown and collared with an open one, Proper.

===Umfraville Earls===
Gilbert de Umfraville inherited the earldom while in his minority after his father&#x27;s death in 1245. Gilbert fought on the English side during the first war of Scottish independence until his death in 1308. His heir, second son Robert, also fought on the side of the English and surrendered to King Robert de Brus during the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. He was released by Robert and treated with the Scots for peace with England. He was ultimately disinherited of his titles. Robert&#x27;s heir Gilbert continued attempting to recover the earldom and supported Edward Balliol and other disinherited barons and lords in Scotland.

===Stewart Earls===
John Stewart of Bonkyll, Berwickshire, obtained the title Earl of Angus in 1329 in a new line after the forfeiture of the de Umfraville line, though the latter family continued to use the title in England until 1381. This Stewart line ended with Margaret Stewart, countess of Angus in her own right, and widow of Thomas, Earl of Mar.

===Douglas earls===
An illicit affair between Margaret Stewart, Countess of Mar and Angus, and her brother in law, William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas (married to the sister of her husband), produced George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus (c. 1380–1403). The Countess secured a charter of her estates for her son, to whom in 1389 the title was granted by King Robert II. He was taken prisoner at Homildon Hill in 1402, and died in captivity in England. Archibald &quot;Bell-the-Cat&quot; (1453–1514) the powerful adversary of James III, was his great-grandson.

William Douglas (1589–1660) 11th Earl of Angus, was created Marquis of Douglas in 1633. He resigned the title of Earl of Angus, having it recreated with the marquessate, so he was the 1st Earl of Angus in the new creation. He outlived his son Archibald Douglas, Earl of Angus (c. 1609–1655), and was succeeded by Archibald&#x27;s son James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas (1646–1699). James&#x27; son and heir Archibald Douglas was created Duke of Douglas, Marquess of Angus and Abernethy, Viscount of Jedburgh Forest, and Lord Douglas of Bonkill, Prestoun and Robertoun on 10 April 1703. He died without leaving an heir and the titles acquired with the dukedom became extinct. All his other titles devolved to his distant cousin the 7th Duke of Hamilton, whose descendants hold them still.

<text>Panphobia, omniphobia, pantophobia, or panophobia is a vague and persistent dread of some unknown evil. Panphobia is not registered as a type of phobia in medical references.

==History==
The term &quot;panphobia&quot; was first coined by Théodule-Armand Ribot in his 1911 work &quot;The Psychology of the Emotions&quot;. He defined it as &quot;a state in which a patient fears everything or nothing, where anxiety, instead of being riveted on one object, floats as in a dream, and only becomes fixed for an instant at a time, passing from one object to another, as circumstances may determine.&quot; The term comes from the Greek πᾶν - &quot;pan&quot;, neuter of &quot;πᾶς&quot; - &quot;pas&quot;, &quot;all&quot; and φόβος - &quot;phobos&quot;, &quot;fear&quot;. The Greek root word &quot;pan&quot; (ex. &quot;pan&quot;-ic) describes &quot;the unpleasant state inflicted by the intervention of the god Pan.&quot; Pan is characterized as a human–animal hybrid who &quot;appeared as the agent of &quot;panic&quot; fear (that collective, animal-like disorder that seizes military camps at rest, especially at night) and of a form of individual possession (panolepsy).&quot; According to Herodotus, it was Pan who was able to lead the Athenians to victory in the Battle of Marathon, forcing the Persians to flee. It has been argued that &quot;pantophobia&quot; may actually be considered the more accurate name to describe the non-specificity associated with a fear of all.

==Diagnosis==
There is no specific phobia in the DSM-5 which provides criteria for an all-encompassing fear of everything, though the defining symptom for generalized anxiety disorder in this manual is &quot;excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) about a number of events or activities.&quot; Another very relatable state of mind is paranoia, in which one fears that unknown threats could, and most likely will, come from anyone, with distrust potentially leading to a loss of touch with reality. Delusional disorder is a more severe form of this type of disorder. Relevant academic literature may point to panphobia as merely a piece of such more complex states of mental disorder. Pseudoneurotic schizophrenia may be diagnosable in patients who, in addition to panphobia, also exhibit symptoms of &quot;pananxiety&quot;, &quot;panambivalence&quot;, and to a lesser extent, &quot;chaotic sexuality&quot;. These persons differ from generalized anxiety sufferers in that they have &quot;free-floating anxiety that rarely subsides&quot; and are clinically diagnosable as having borderline personality disorder in the DSM-IV-TR. No significant changes related to this personality disorder were made in transitioning to the DSM-5, suggesting the diagnostic criteria are still appropriate.

<text>90125 is the eleventh studio album by the English progressive rock band Yes, released on 7 November 1983 by Atco Records. After Yes disbanded in 1981, following the &quot;Drama&quot; (1980) tour, bassist Chris Squire, drummer Alan White and Trevor Rabin (guitarist, singer, songwriter) formed Cinema, and began recording an album with original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye, who had been fired in 1971. They adopted a more commercial and pop-oriented musical direction as the result of their new material, much of which derived from Rabin&#x27;s demos.
During the mixing stage, former Yes singer Jon Anderson, who had left in 1980, accepted an invitation to return and record the co-lead vocals, and subsequently Cinema became the new lineup of Yes.

Named for its Atco catalogue number, &quot;90125&quot; was released to a generally positive reception and introduced the band to a new generation of fans. It reached No. 5 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart, and remains their best selling album with several million copies sold in the US. Of the album&#x27;s four singles, &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; was the most successful and is their only song to top the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. &quot;Cinema&quot; earned the group a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Yes toured for the album in 1984 and 1985 which included two headline shows at the inaugural Rock in Rio festival. It was remastered in 2004 with previously unreleased bonus tracks.

== Background ==

In December 1980, the Yes line-up of bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, singer Trevor Horn, and keyboardist Geoff Downes, completed their 1980 tour in support of the band&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;Drama&quot;. While the North American leg was largely successful, the subsequent UK leg received a mixed reaction feedback from the fans, many of whom were unaccepting of Horn and Downes as they had replaced Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman respectively. The group disbanded in early 1981; Horn became a record producer, Howe and Downes co-formed the supergroup Asia, and Squire and White remained together and continued to write material, including their 1981 Christmas single &quot;Run with the Fox&quot;. Later in 1981, the two entered sessions with Jimmy Page with the aim of forming a new band named XYZ, but the project was shelved over management differences and singer Robert Plant&#x27;s disliking of the material. According to White, some ideas that the three had rehearsed ended up on &quot;90125&quot;.

By 1982, South African guitarist Trevor Rabin had moved from London to Los Angeles, and sent a demo tape to various record labels with the intent of releasing a fourth solo album. During this time, Atlantic Records manager Phil Carson, a longtime fan and associate of Yes throughout the 1970s, sought new musicians to work with Squire and White, and was introduced to Rabin by producer Mutt Lange, whom Rabin used to work with as a session musician. Carson had Rabin meet and play with Squire and White in London. Rabin recalled the first sessions &quot;didn&#x27;t sound great but it felt good ... there was a lot of potential&quot;. This led to Rabin turning down a solo deal from RCA Records as he wished to work within a group context, especially with a &quot;great rhythm section&quot;. The three entered rehearsals for an album using most of Rabin&#x27;s demos, including &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;, &quot;Hold On&quot;, and &quot;Changes&quot; which displayed a more commercial and pop-oriented direction and less complex in structure than previous Yes music. With such a direction, Squire recruited original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye, who had left in 1971, feeling his simpler style of playing was more suitable to their new music. Horn followed suit as a potential lead singer, but after unsuccessful rehearsals, opted to become their producer. The four named themselves Cinema with the intent of establishing a new identity and to distance themselves from their Yes past.
Around six months into the album, Kaye left after clashing with Horn. Rabin saw it as &quot;a mutual parting&quot; as Kaye resisted learning the modern keyboard technology that the band were using, leaving Rabin to handle most of the keyboard parts. Matters were complicated further when management deemed Squire and Rabin&#x27;s lead vocals not distinctive enough, so Carson suggested the group have Anderson return to sing the songs. Squire got in touch with Anderson, who had returned to England in April 1983 after working in France. They listened to the tape in Squire&#x27;s car outside Anderson&#x27;s home due to past acrimony between the pair&#x27;s wives. Anderson liked the songs and got involved, making minor changes to the lyrics and arrangements. By this time the album had cost £300,000 to make, half of which came from Carson himself. With no more funds left to finish it, Carson flew to Paris and played the tape to Atlantic founder Ahmet Ertegun, who had signed Yes in 1969. Ertegun, interested in the prospect of a new album with Anderson on vocals, agreed to pay the remaining costs.

As the album neared completion, news reports in June and July 1983 indicate that Kaye, though he had played on it, was unsure whether to rejoin. The album was given the provisional title &quot;The New Yes Album&quot;, a reference to their third, &quot;The Yes Album&quot; (1971), but the group opted for an alternative name to distance themselves from Yes and decided upon its allocated catalogue number on their label Atco Records, a subsidiary of Atlantic. It was 90124 initially, but sleeve designer Garry Mouat said: &quot;Because they couldn&#x27;t get consistency worldwide with that number, it got changed to &quot;90125&quot;. I&#x27;ve still got some rough tour t-shirts and sleeves with the original number.&quot;

After the band introduced themselves as Cinema on MTV, they received legal threats from other bands with the same name. This prompted Carson to suggest that they continue as Yes, as the group now consisted of four past Yes members. When Rabin, who wished the album to be judged in its own right, was eventually persuaded, work began on promotion and rehearsals with keyboardist Eddie Jobson, formerly of Roxy Music and U.K. (Duncan Mackay, formerly of Cockney Rebel and 10cc, was also considered for the position.) Jobson appeared in the video for &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; and was reported in the press as a Yes member as late as November 1983; however, seeking to consolidate the band&#x27;s legal identity as Yes, management came to an agreement with Kaye who returned after touring with Badfinger. Unimpressed with the change, citing &quot;political problems&quot; within the group, and having a lack of interest in sharing live duties with Kaye, Jobson left by early 1984.

== Production ==

=== Recording ===
Recording began in November 1982 at SARM Studios in London while the group was known as Cinema, with Horn as producer; &quot;Hold On&quot; was produced by Horn and Yes. Production was assisted by Gary Langan and Julian Mendelsohn, both of whom also worked on &quot;Drama&quot;, with Stuart Bruce and Keith Finney.

=== Songs ===
&quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; was one of the songs from Rabin&#x27;s set of demos; its bass line and its hook had been written while he was in the bathroom. When the song was chosen for inclusion on the album, Squire replaced Rabin&#x27;s original bridge. The song features a sample from the horn section of &quot;Kool Is Back&quot; by Funk, Inc., that Horn intended to use on an album by Malcolm McLaren, which he was also producing. The sample was then stored onto his Fairlight CMI and played by White. Rabin had used the same guitar tone for the opening on a session he did for Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band, which involved panning two guitar tracks left and right and aimed for a sound &quot;as heavy as possible&quot;.

&quot;Hold On&quot; was originally titled &quot;Moving In&quot;; the final song was an amalgamation of two songs Rabin had written as they both had the same tempo. The chorus of &quot;Hold On&quot; was retained with its verses taken from &quot;Moving In&quot;.

&quot;It Can Happen&quot; was written on the piano by Squire, with its introduction put together by Rabin to go with his piano chords.

&quot;Changes&quot; was another song from Rabin&#x27;s demos, with its introduction put together by White. Rabin developed it during a &quot;depressed time&quot;, after a potential solo album deal with Geffen Records fell through as they wished for him to join a band and play more &quot;like Foreigner&quot;.

&quot;Cinema&quot; is an instrumental track recorded live at AIR Studios. Originally the group developed an unreleased 20-minute song named &quot;Time&quot; and decided to include its two-minute opening on the final album.

&quot;Leave It&quot; developed from a bass line from Squire and a melody from Rabin. When it came to recording the song, the band were not satisfied with the drum sound they were getting in the studio, so they recorded the vocals first. However, one of the engineers had removed the song&#x27;s click track time references, causing various synchronisation problems. Rabin spent as much as three days re-doing the vocals onto a Synclavier, but it &quot;didn&#x27;t feel completely right. So we redid the whole thing on top of the Synclavier stuff&quot;, a process that took several weeks.

The lyrics to &quot;Our Song&quot; mentions the city of Toledo, Ohio, itself a reference to the band&#x27;s show at the Toledo Sports Arena on their 1977 tour where the temperature on stage reached . The song received considerable radio airplay in the Toledo area.

&quot;City of Love&quot; was inspired by Rabin&#x27;s visit to Harlem in New York City while on his way to a rehearsal with Foreigner. His taxi arrived at the wrong address in a dangerous part of the area. Upon his return to Los Angeles, Rabin started to write an &quot;ominous kind of thing&quot; which came easy to him following the experience, &quot;the idea of waiting for the night to come ... the derelicts came out of the sewers at nighttime to be thugs. Later Jon put his slant on it which made it more interesting&quot;. The opening features a looped snippet of the introduction to &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; by Italian composer Ottorino Respighi as part of the backing track.

&quot;Hearts&quot; is the album&#x27;s second track that is credited to the whole group: Rabin came up with the chorus and bridge a few months prior to meeting Squire and White for the first time; Kaye wrote its keyboard introduction, Rabin developed a melody from it, and Anderson developed its counter-melody.

=== Sleeve design ===
The album&#x27;s logo was designed and created by Garry Mouat at Assorted Images on an Apple IIe computer, and a variant would be used on Yes&#x27;s next studio album &quot;Big Generator&quot;. Trevor Rabin&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;90124&quot; uses the same cover design with colour and text variations.

&quot;I became involved as I&#x27;d worked with Trevor Horn when he set up the ZTT record label…&quot; Mouat told &quot;Classic Rock&quot;. &quot;At that point the band were called Cinema. The original design was similar to the eventual sleeve, but with the elliptical grey Y on its side and without the stick, to make it a C. But when Jon Anderson came back, they reverted to Yes… I know some fans think that sleeve was inappropriate, but Yes wanted something completely different to the Roger Dean works, and were interested in using modern design technology, as it fitted the new techniques they were using.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;90125&quot; was released on 7 November 1983. It reached No. 5 in the US and No. 16 in the UK.

Four singles were released from &quot;90125&quot;; &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; was released a month prior to the album and reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for two weeks and the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks. In 1984, &quot;It Can Happen&quot;, &quot;Changes&quot;, and &quot;Leave It&quot; reached the top ten on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks.

In 1985, &quot;Cinema&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance and &quot;90125&quot; received a nomination for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.

=== Reception ===

A review in &quot;The Morning Call&quot; considered &quot;90125&quot; one of the band&#x27;s best releases, calling it the &quot;missing link&quot; between the popular earlier albums &quot;The Yes Album&quot; (1971) and &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971). It described the keyboard parts as &quot;dreamy&quot; and at times &quot;a contemporary rock attack&quot;, favouring this style over the more flamboyant approach adopted by former Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman. The review also stated that the &quot;stalwart&quot; rhythm section of Squire and White &quot;hasn&#x27;t lost anything&quot;, and named Rabin as &quot;the biggest surprise&quot; of the group who &quot;adds a much needed gutsiness&quot;. Furthermore, the review compared &quot;Cinema&quot; to a Jeff Beck track. 

In a review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Terry Atkinson noted the prominent role of Rabin in the group but believed it falls short of the band&#x27;s previous albums because of Anderson&#x27;s reduced input into the songs, or a lack of the &quot;old inspiration&quot;. Atkinson named &quot;Hearts&quot; as touching on the &quot;monumental yet warm&quot; music Yes had made in the 1970s, specifically &quot;Awaken&quot; from &quot;Going for the One&quot; (1977). Nonetheless, Atkinson wrote the album is &quot;densely dynamic&quot; and liked &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; for being &quot;catchy&quot; and &quot;full of unexpected turns&quot;, and wrote the simpler tracks &quot;Our Song&quot; and &quot;Changes&quot; allowed Yes to change their sound &quot;without too seriously damaging its reputation&quot;. He concluded that &quot;90125&quot; is &quot;enjoyable, only somewhat disappointing&quot;. 

J. D. Considine gave a mostly favourable review of &quot;90125&quot; for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He points out &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; sounds &quot;too hip, too street-smart for a band whose idea of a pop song was once something as rococo as &quot;Roundabout&quot;, yet credits the band&#x27;s reinvention to Horn&#x27;s production with &quot;flashy pop sensibility&quot; and his handling of the group&#x27;s vocal harmonies. He thought &quot;Cinema&quot; and &quot;Our Song&quot; showed Yes displaying &quot;old tricks&quot; with such &quot;overblown&quot; tracks, though complimented the record as a whole for its accessibility. 

&quot;BAM&quot; magazine praised &quot;90125&quot;, thinking Yes&#x27; &quot;dramatic rise from the ashes of rock&#x27;s touring heaps&quot; had created &quot;some of the year&#x27;s freshest, most un-dinosaur-like music&quot; with its &quot;stunning blend of pop, synthetics, fusion and classical music&quot;.

Critic and author Martin Popoff thought &quot;90125&quot; was the band&#x27;s most &quot;successful and sociable album&quot; of their entire catalogue, comparing &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; to the Police. He declared the record &quot;a rich album experience with legs&quot;. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Paul Collins gave &quot;90125&quot; four-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it &quot;a stunning self-reinvention by a band that many had given up for dead&quot; while complimenting Horn&#x27;s &quot;slick&quot; production work and the &quot;crisp&quot; synthesisers on &quot;Changes&quot;. He also cites the vocal arrangements on &quot;Leave It&quot; and the &quot;beautifully sprawling&quot; &quot;Hearts&quot; as high points on the record, which has &quot;nary a duff track&quot;. David Ellefson of Megadeth stated his fondness of the album, particularly Rabin&#x27;s guitar work and quality of the production. He called it &quot;a game-changer&quot;, and named it one of his desert island discs. The album&#x27;s orchestral stabs were an influence on Megadeth&#x27;s first album, &quot;Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!&quot;.

==Tour==

Yes promoted the album with a worldwide tour that lasted from 28 February 1984 to 9 February 1985, spanning over 110 dates. It was meant to start with a North American leg from January 1984, but the dates were cancelled after Rabin collided with a woman in a swimming pool, ruptured his spleen, and required surgery to have it removed. American new wave band Berlin were scheduled as the opening act during the first North American leg, but they were dropped from the tour due to a contract dispute. Instead, the band opened their shows with two Bugs Bunny cartoons. The show in Dortmund on 24 June saw the group performing &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot; with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. 

In 1985, Yes headlined two shows at the inaugural Rock in Rio festival. This was followed by two sold-out dates in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which marked the first time an English band had performed in the country following the Falklands War. Anderson recalled the group were escorted into the country in a private air force jet, and were surrounded by militia during the entire visit. They had a conference call with the president before their arrival, who ensured their safety despite reported death threats against the band.

<text>Petty officer first class (PO1) is a rank found in some navies and maritime organizations. 

==Canada==
Petty officer, 1st class, PO1, is a Naval non-commissioned member rank of the Canadian Forces. It is senior to the rank of petty officer 2nd-class and its equivalents, and junior to chief petty officer 2nd-class and its equivalents. Its Army and Air Force equivalent is warrant officer (WO).

The French form of the rank is &quot;maître de 1re classe&quot;. 

The rank insignia of the PO1 is a crown worn on both forearms of the Service Dress tunic, and on slip-ons on both shoulders of other uniforms. PO1s are generally initially addressed as &quot;Petty Officer Bloggins&quot; or &quot;PO Bloggins&quot;, and thereafter as &quot;PO&quot;, although in correspondence the full rank or abbreviation is used before the member&#x27;s name. The full appellation &quot;Petty Officer 1st-Class&quot; or &quot;PO1&quot; in speech is generally used only when the &quot;first-class&quot; distinction be made, such as to distinguish between members with similar names but differing ranks, or on promotion parades.

==United States==

It is the sixth enlisted rate or enlisted rank E-6 in the United States Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard, ranking just above petty officer second class and directly below chief petty officer. It is designated as non-commissioned officer, as are all petty officer ratings. It is equivalent to the rank of staff sergeant in the Army and Marine Corps, and technical sergeant in the Air Force. 
They are all ranked E-6, which refers to the enlisted numbering system associated with pay grades.

===Overview===
In the United States Navy, each rating is officially abbreviated, such as ET for Electronics Technician, STS for Sonar Technician Submarines, or FT for Fire Control Technician. It is common practice to refer to the Petty Officer by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence (such as printing and inscription on awards). Often, the Petty Officer is just referred to by the shorthand designation, without using the surname. Thus ET1 Jones would just be called &quot;ET1&quot;. A First Class Petty Officer may be generically referred to as PO1 when the sailor&#x27;s rating is not known, although some prefer to be called simply &quot;Petty Officer (last name)&quot;. To address a Petty Officer, one would say, &quot;Petty Officer Smith&quot;, &quot;Smith&quot;, or &quot;Sailor&quot; (the latter two forms being acceptable for use by those equal or greater in rank than the Petty Officer). It is uncommon to address a Petty Officer as simply, &quot;Petty Officer&quot; the way one might address an NCO in the Army as &quot;Sergeant&quot;. Also acceptable, but archaic, would be to address a Petty Officer or Chief Petty Officer of any grade as &quot;Mister Smith&quot; or &quot;Ms. Smith&quot;. The use of &quot;Ms.&quot; or &quot;Mister&quot; is commonly only in reference to junior commissioned officers or warrant officers.

Similar to Petty Officer Second Class and Third Class, advancement to Petty Officer First Class is contingent upon the following conditions:

*Completed a period of time-in-rate (three years time-in-rate as a second-class petty officer, or two years if the second-class petty officer received a promotion recommendation of &quot;early promote&quot; (EP) on their latest periodic performance evaluation and the second-class petty officer&#x27;s commanding officer authorizes a one-year time-in-rate waiver).
*Recommended for advancement by the commanding officer.
*Have an established performance mark average.
*No pending request for voluntary transfer to the fleet reserve.

The advancement cycle is currently every 6 months (March and September). Only second-class petty officers that achieve a passing score on the biannual advancement examination are eligible to be advanced to first-class petty officer. Once the examination is complete, a quota is established based upon the needs of the Navy with respect to the specific rating the sailor holds. Using the rating ET (electronics technician) as an example:

*1,000 ET2 (electronics technician, second class) eligible to be advanced after passing the advancement examination
*100 are allowed to be advanced to ET1 (electronics technician, first class) by the Navy (a 10% quota)
*The 100th eligible ET2 received a 219.5 final multiple score, therefore 219.5 is the lowest possible final multiple allowed to advance to ET1.

The Navy&#x27;s current high year tenure policy imposes a maximum enlistment of 22 years (total active service) to a petty officer first class. If a petty officer first class is not selected to the paygrade of chief petty officer within those 22 years, the petty officer is honorably retired from active service in the United States Navy, and placed in Fleet Reserve (inactive service) for a period of 8 to 10 years. Should there be no recall of the sailor to active duty due to war or national emergency, the sailor will then transition to a &quot;retired&quot; status after a combined total of 30 years of service.

The rate insignia for a petty officer, first class is a perched eagle above three chevrons. On more formal uniforms (dress white and dress blue uniform), the symbol for the petty officer&#x27;s rating will be placed between the eagle and the chevrons. On white uniforms, the eagle, rating, and chevrons are dark blue (almost black- this has led to the eagle being referred to as the &quot;crow&quot; in common practice, and often the entire rating badge is simply referred to as the crow). On navy blue (black) uniforms, the eagle and rating are white, and the chevrons are red, unless the sailor has served in the Navy for at least 12 consecutive years, with good conduct, then that sailor wears gold chevrons on the dress blue uniform. Gold chevrons are also worn on the collars of the Navy blue coveralls uniform, and on the black garrison cap (only) worn with the Navy service working uniform (often called &quot;peanut butters&quot; or &quot;black and tans&quot;). The Coast Guard does not use golden chevrons. Working uniforms (all variations of the camouflage uniform) and metal rank devices do not have the rating badge symbol.

First class petty officers normally serve as leading petty officers of a division, and direct the activities of a division. There are situations when there are more than one first class petty officers in a division, due to the demands for highly experienced or skilled Sailors in technical areas. Leading petty officer experience for a first-class petty officer is not officially required for advancement to chief petty officer (E7); however, it is generally accepted that at least one documented tour as an LPO (preferably at sea) is a vital step for advancement.

First-class petty officers often form associations at their commands. Memberships in these associations are voluntary. On larger ships and some shore commands, PO1s may have their own mess, although unlike the CPO mess and wardroom mess, which have their own galleys and cooks, the first class &quot;mess&quot; is merely a separate compartment for eating meals from the general crew mess.

Petty officers (E4-E6) serve a dual role as both technical experts and as leaders. Unlike the sailors below them, there is no such thing as an &quot;undesignated petty officer.&quot; Every petty officer has both a rate (rank) and rating (job, similar to a Military Occupation Specialty (MOS) in other services). A petty officer&#x27;s full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a petty officer, first class, who has the rating of electronics technician would properly be called an Electronics Technician First Class, or ET1. The term &quot;petty officer&quot; is typically only used in the general sense when referring to a group of petty officers of different ratings, when the petty officer&#x27;s rating is unknown, or when someone who is E-3 or below addresses a petty officer while in basic training or &quot;A&quot; school.

<text>BASIC A+ is an implementation of the BASIC programming language for Atari 8-bit computers introduced by Optimized Systems Software in 1981. It was developed by the team that created Atari BASIC, which shipped with each computer, and is compatible. BASIC A+. BASIC A+ adds new features to the language, such as codice_1 statements, support for hardware features like player/missile graphics, and commands for debugging. While Atari BASIC is an 8 KB ROM cartridge, BASIC A+ is floppy disk based and uses 15 KB of the computer&#x27;s RAM, leaving 23 KB available for user programs in a 48 KB Atari 800. BASIC A+ shipped with a supplement to the Atari BASIC reference manual as its documentation.

Optimized Systems Software followed BASIC A+ with the cartridge-based BASIC XL, then BASIC XE.

<text>The Yadkin River is one of the longest rivers in the US state of North Carolina, flowing . It rises in the northwestern portion of the state near the Blue Ridge Parkway&#x27;s Thunder Hill Overlook. Several parts of the river are impounded by dams for water, power, and flood control. The river becomes the Pee Dee River at the confluence of the Uwharrie River south of the community of Badin and east of the town of Albemarle. The river then flows into South Carolina near Cheraw, which is at the Fall Line. The entirety of the Yadkin River and the Great Pee Dee River is part of the Yadkin-Pee Dee River Basin.

==Etymology==
The meaning of the word Yadkin, derived from &quot;Yattken&quot;, or &quot;Yattkin&quot;, a Siouan Indian word, is unknown. In Siouan terminology it may mean &quot;big tree&quot; or &quot;place of big trees.&quot;

Alternate names include:
:Adkin River
:Atkin River
:Big Yadkin River
:Reatkin River
:Sapona River
:Yatkin River

Yadkin County, North Carolina, and its county seat, the town of Yadkinville, are named after the river.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the Yadkin basin was inhabited by Siouan-speaking tribes. The Saura and Tutelo tribes are mentioned in historic records of the area. Before the Revolutionary War, colonial settlers of primarily Scots-Irish, German, and English extraction migrated into the Yadkin basin from Virginia and Pennsylvania using the Great Wagon Road and the Carolina Road. Notably, these included Moravian colonists from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania who occupied the 100,000-acre Wachovia tract following its purchase in 1753 (See also Old Salem).

On May 9, 1771, when marching to join Governor William Tryon&#x27;s army at the Battle of Alamance, a colonial force was intercepted along the Yadkin in Rowan County by a larger force of Regulators formed under Captain Benjamin Merrill. Realizing their forces were outnumbered, Tryon&#x27;s men fell back to Salisbury, and were unable to join the governor until after the battle at Alamance was fought.

In 1859 the NC Supreme court noted &quot;it is certain that the Yadkin river is capable of private ownership and that some parts of the riverbed have been granted to private individuals.&quot; The court determined that the owners of the dam across the Yadkin could not have his property taken without just compensation.

==Use==
The river is extensively used for recreation. Fishing consists mostly of sunfish, catfish, largemouth bass and white bass in the spring and early summer. Canoeing and rafting are also possible. A portion of the river flows through Pilot Mountain State Park. Morrow Mountain State Park and the Uwharrie National Forest are along the banks of the river where the river&#x27;s name changes to the Pee Dee River.

===State trail===
In 1985, the NC General Assembly established the Yadkin River State Trail as a paddle trail which follows the river for . The paddle trail is a part of the North Carolina State Trails System, which is a section of the NC Division of Parks and Recreation. A system of launch points and camping locations were created along the river for the trail.

==Geography==
Principal tributaries of the Yadkin include the Reddies, Roaring, Mitchell, Fisher, Ararat and South Yadkin Rivers.

==Water supply==
Water supplies for many communities in North and South Carolina are taken from the Yadkin-Pee Dee and during drought years the division of the water is a contentious issue. The Mitchell River was impacted in the 1980s by massive runoff of sediment from land clearing at the Olde Beau development. Numerous citations from the NC EPA were issued against developer Earl Slick but the development proceeded. 

Cones Lake is a reservoir located immediately upstream of where the Yadkin River begins, marking it one of the initial sources of the Yadkin River.

===Lakes created by dams along the Yadkin/Pee Dee River===
There are many reservoirs created by damming the Yadkin and Pee Dee rivers within the bounds of North Carolina, and are listed from upstream to downstream:
*W. Kerr Scott Reservoir
*High Rock Lake
*Tuckertown Reservoir
*Badin Lake
*Falls Reservoir
*Lake Tillery
*Blewitt Falls Lake

All but W. Kerr Scott generate hydroelectric power, and High Rock, Tuckertown, Badin, and Falls were managed by Alcoa under contract with the US Government, under oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The contract with FERC expired in April 2008, and was under review after the N.C. Division of Water Quality revoked their water-quality certificate that the company needs to continue operating its power-generating dams along the river. The former governor of North Carolina, Bev Perdue, and other North Carolina politicians made it a priority to recapture the Yadkin River water rights, but this has been denied. On September 22, 2016, Alcoa received a license to operate until March 31, 2055, a period 12 years shorter than desired. The license requires a minimum water level and a swimming beach for High Rock Lake. The terms of the license will now apply to Cube Hydro Carolinas, which bought the hydroelectric power operations.

<doc id="555908" wikidata="Q6073845" url="?curid=555908" title="Irrigation scheduling">
<text>Irrigation scheduling is the process used by irrigation system managers to determine the correct frequency and duration of watering. 

The following factors may be taken into consideration:
* Precipitation rate of the irrigation equipment – how quickly the water is applied, often expressed in inches or mm per hour.
* Distribution uniformity of the irrigation system – how uniformly the water is applied, expressed as a percentage, the higher the number, the more uniform.
* Soil infiltration rate – how quickly the water is absorbed by the soil, the rate of which also decreases as the soil becomes wetter, also often expressed in inches or mm per hour.
* Slope (topography) of the land being irrigated as this affects how quickly runoff occurs, often expressed as a percentage, i.e. distance of fall divided by 100 units of horizontal distance (1 ft of fall per would be 1%).
* Soil available water capacity, expressed in units of water per unit of soil, i.e. inches of water per foot of soil.
* Effective rooting depth of the plants to be watered, which affects how much water can be stored in the soil and made available to the plants.
* Current watering requirements of the plant (which may be estimated by calculating evapotranspiration, or ET), often expressed in inches per day.
* Amount of time in which water or labor may be available for irrigation.
* Amount of allowable moisture stress which may be placed on the plant. For high value vegetable crops, this may mean no allowable stress, while for a lawn some stress would be allowable, since the goal would not be to maximize production, but merely to keep the lawn green and healthy. 
* Timing to take advantage of projected rainfall
* Timing to take advantage of favorable utility rates
* Timing to avoid interfering with other activities such as sporting events, holidays, lawn maintenance, or crop harvesting.

The goal in irrigation scheduling is to apply enough water to fully wet the plant&#x27;s root zone while minimizing overwatering and then allow the soil to dry out in between waterings, to allow air to enter the soil and encourage root development, but not so much that the plant is stressed beyond what is allowable.

In recent years, more sophisticated irrigation controllers have been developed that receive ET input from either a single on-site weather station or from a network of stations and automatically adjust the irrigation schedule accordingly. 

Other devices helpful in irrigation scheduling are rain sensors, which automatically shut off or may turn off manually an irrigation system when it rains, and soil moisture sensing devices such as capacitance sensors, tensiometers and gypsum blocks.

<text>The Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson was an extralegal and unrecognized United States territory that existed in the Pike&#x27;s Peak mining region from October 24, 1859, until it yielded to the new Territory of Colorado on June 6, 1861. The Jefferson Territory, named for Founding Father and third United States president Thomas Jefferson, included land officially part of the Kansas Territory, the Nebraska Territory, the New Mexico Territory, the Utah Territory, and the Washington Territory, but the region was remote from the governments of those five territories.

The government of the Jefferson Territory, while democratically elected, was never legally recognized by the United States government, although it managed the territory with relatively free rein for 19 months. Many of the laws enacted by the General Assembly of the Territory of Jefferson were reenacted and given official sanction by the new Colorado General Assembly in 1861.

==Origins==
On August 25, 1855, the Kansas Territory created Arapahoe County, a huge county that included the entire western portion of Kansas to the Rocky Mountains. The boundaries of Arapahoe County were defined as: beginning at the northeast corner of New Mexico, running thence north to the south line of Nebraska and north line of Kansas; thence along said line to the east line of Utah Territory; thence along said line between Utah and Kansas territories, to where said line strikes New Mexico; thence along the line between said New Mexico and the territory of Kansas to the place of beginning.

Occupied primarily by Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians with few white settlers, the county was never organized. The leaders of the Kansas Territory were preoccupied with the violent events of Bleeding Kansas, so little time or attention was available to attend to the needs of the far western portion of the territory. The question of whether to admit Kansas to the union as a slave state or free state dominated discussion in the populous eastern portion of the territory and led to three failed constitutional proposals between 1855 and 1858 (the Topeka, Lecompton and Leavenworth constitutions). The United States Congress was likewise preoccupied with threats of secession by the slave states.

In July 1858, the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush began with the discovery of gold at the Dry Creek Diggings in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory (now Englewood in Arapahoe County, Colorado). The gold rush brought 100,000 gold seekers to the area known as the Pike&#x27;s Peak Country, which included Arapahoe County as well as the unorganized southwestern corner of the Nebraska Territory and parts of the New Mexico and Utah territories.

Kansas, with a growing divide between the eastern commercial centers and the central agricultural populations, had concerns over how the gold rush and the influx of miners to the Rockies could shift the base of power from the northeastern side of Kansas to the mountainous region in the west of the state. Meanwhile, the miners, being from the capital of the territory, felt that the legislature was out of touch with their needs. They thought a new territory or state would have the benefit of being responsive to their economic situation and consolidate the population that was currently spread across four territories. Denver area leaders decided to pursue both a relationship with Kansas and a bid for separation by sending delegates to the Kansas Territorial Legislature and the United States Congress.

On February 7, 1859, the Kansas Territorial Legislature replaced Arapahoe County with six new unorganized counties and appointed county commissioners for each. However, since the commissioners were not provided a salary, they never took office. The settlers in the region attempted to organize a county on their own and on March 28, 1859, an election was held to elect officers. A total of 774 votes were cast, including 231 from Auraria and 144 from Denver City. A desire for a new territorial government kept the elected officials from taking their offices, as doing so would have given recognition to the Kansas Territorial government. In the meantime, Hiram J Graham, the local delegate to Congress, had successfully introduced a bill to establish a new territory in Pike&#x27;s Peak Country. Though the bill did not pass, it nevertheless encouraged settlers to establish a separate government themselves.

==Establishment==

In April 1859, a small convention was held at Wootton&#x27;s Hall in Auraria about the need for a local government. The name Jefferson (in honor of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States who had authorized the 1803 Louisiana Purchase that included much of the proposed territory) was chosen and a constitutional convention was scheduled for June 6, 1859. The conventioneers met that day, and then adjourned until August 1, 1859, when 167 representatives from 37 districts met to draft a constitution for Jefferson State. The state constitution was subsequently rejected in a popular referendum on September 24 in favor of creating a territory, primarily because the organization of the territory would be funded by Congress while the organization of a state would be self-funded. The original authors determined to hold another convention on October 3 to draft a provisional constitution for the Territory of Jefferson.

The proposed Territory of Jefferson included all of the present State of Colorado, but it was 70 percent more extensive. The territory had the same southern boundary as the present State of Colorado, the 37th parallel north, but the northern boundary was set at the 43rd parallel north, farther north than Colorado&#x27;s current northern boundary, the 41st parallel north. In addition the eastern boundary was located about farther east at the 102nd meridian west, and the western boundary about farther west at the 110th meridian west. The territory was divided into eight council districts and 19 representative districts.

On October 24, 1859, an election was held to approve the formation of the Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson and to elect officials for the territory. The formation of a provisional government was approved by a vote of 1,852 to 280 and the following officials were elected:
On November 7, 1859, Governor Robert Williamson Steele opened the first session of the provisional Jefferson Territorial Legislature in Denver City with the following proclamation:

During this first session, the legislature organized 12 counties. (The Colorado General Assembly would create 17 counties with somewhat similar boundaries in 1861.) The legislature adjourned on December 7, 1859.

Many settlers from eastern Kansas preferred to be governed by that territory. Those resistant to the self-government of Jefferson Territory held an election on December 8, 1859, and elected Captain R. Sopris as their representative to the Kansas Territorial Legislature.

Governor Steele called the second session of the provisional Jefferson Territorial Legislature to meet at Denver City on January 23, 1860.

Many disappointed gold seekers left the region in 1860. The United States Census of 1860 counted approximately 35,000 persons in the region of the Jefferson Territory. Governor Steele pointed out that many gold seekers were working claims in remote areas and estimated that the total number of people in the Jefferson Territory was 60,000.

Governor Steele attempted to reach accommodation with the officials of the Kansas Territory. On August 7, 1860, Steele issued a proclamation requesting that the Provisional Government of the Jefferson Territory be merged into the Kansas Territory. Kansas officials would have no merger with what they considered to be an outlaw government, so the stalemate continued.

On November 7, 1860, the U.S. presidential election produced a victory for Abraham Lincoln and precipitated the secession of seven slave states and the formation of the Confederate States of America. These events eliminated any chance for federal endorsement of the Territory of Jefferson and any role in government for Governor Steele, a staunch pro-Union Democrat and vocal opponent of Lincoln and the Republican Party.

Seeking to augment the political power of the free states, the Republican-led U.S. Congress hurriedly admitted the portion of the Territory of Kansas east of the 25th meridian west from Washington to the Union as the free State of Kansas on January 29, 1861. Kansas statehood left the western portion of the now defunct Kansas Territory, which the Jefferson Territory also claimed, officially unorganized. While the federal government refused to sanction the Jefferson Territory, it had effectively acknowledged the eastern border of the region.

==Counties==

On November 28, 1859, the Territory of Jefferson created 12 counties:
#Arrappahoe County, county seat Denver City, evolved into Arapahoe and Douglas counties, Colorado Territory.
#Cheyenne County evolved into southern Laramie County, Wyoming Territory.
#El Paso County, county seat Colorado City, evolved into El Paso County, Colorado Territory.
#Fountain County, county seat Pueblo, evolved into Pueblo, Fremont, and Huerfano counties, Colorado Territory.
#Heele County, county seat La Porte, evolved into eastern Larimer County, Colorado Territory.
#Jackson County, county seat Boulder City, evolved into Boulder County, Colorado Territory
#Jefferson County, county seat Arapahoe City, evolved into Jefferson County, Colorado Territory
#Mountain County, county seat Central City, evolved into Gilpin and Clear Creek counties, Colorado Territory.
#North County evolved into western Larimer County, Colorado Territory.
#Park County, county seat Tarryall City, evolved into Park County, Colorado Territory.
#Saratoga County, county seat Breckinridge, evolved into Summit County, Colorado Territory.
#Saint Vrain&#x27;s CountySt. Vrain&#x27;s County, county seat Saint VrainSt. Vrain, evolved into Weld County, Colorado Territory.

==Capitals==
*Denver City – October 24, 1859, to November 13, 1860.
*Golden City – November 13, 1860, to June 6, 1861.
Most administrative affairs of the Territory of Jefferson were handled at the home of Governor Steele at Mount Vernon.

==Dissolution==
On February 26, 1861, Congress passed a bill organizing the Territory of Colorado. The bill was signed into law by U.S. President James Buchanan two days later on February 28, 1861. On May 29, 1861, William Gilpin, newly appointed Governor of the Territory of Colorado, arrived in Denver City. Most citizens of the region welcomed their new government. On June 6, 1861, Governor Steele issued a proclamation declaring the Territory of Jefferson disbanded and urging all employees and residents to abide by the laws governing the United States.

<text>The Ganden Tripa, also spelled Gaden Tripa ( &quot;Holder of the Ganden Throne&quot;), is the title of the spiritual leader of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism, the school that controlled central Tibet from the mid-17th century until the 1950s. The 103rd Ganden Tripa, Jetsun Lobsang Tenzin, died in office on 21 April 2017. Currently, Jangtse Choejey Kyabje Jetsun Lobsang Tenzin Palsangpo is the 104th Ganden Tripa.

The head of the Gelugpa order is the Ganden Tripa and not, as is often misunderstood, the Dalai Lama. It is also often misunderstood that the Ganden Tripa is the same person as the abbot of Ganden monastery. Ganden has two abbots, the abbot of Ganden Shartse and the abbot of Ganden Jangtse, and neither of them can be the Ganden Tripa unless they have also served as abbot of Gyumay or Gyuto tantric colleges. See &#x27;Mode of Appointment&#x27; below.

The Ganden Tripa is an appointed office directly by Lama Tsongkhapa to Gyaltsab Je, not a reincarnation lineage. It is awarded on the basis of merit which is the basis of his hierarchical progression. Since the position is held for only a 7-year term, there have been many more Ganden Tripas than Dalai Lamas to date (104 as against 14).

Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), who founded the Gelug, is the first Ganden Tripa. After Tsongkhapa&#x27;s death, his teachings were held and kept by Gyaltsab Je and Khedrub Je who were the next abbots of Ganden monastery. The lineage has been held by the Ganden Tripas.

In January 2003, the Central Tibetan Administration announced the nomination of the 101st Ganden Tripa. An excerpt from that press release gives his background:

The 100th Ganden Tripa, Lobsang Nyima Rinpoche, retired and lived at Drepung Loselling Monastery with his labrang (office staff) until his death in 2008.

==Mode of appointment==

The Ganden Tripa is nominated or appointed on the basis of a hierarchical progression based on merit, and the appointee does not necessarily have to have any direct connection with Ganden Monastery, although if he started as a Ganden monk he could have obtained his higher Geshe degree there and risen to be its abbot.

There is a traditional Tibetan saying: “If a beggar’s child has the ability, there is no stopping him becoming the Throne Holder of Ganden.” It means the post is obtained on merit alone, rather than by recognition as the incarnation of a teacher, or other means.

This, and the hierarchy through which any Gelugpa monk can rise up through the ranks on merit to become the Ganden Tripa is briefly described in the November 2011 edition of Me-Long, a journal published by the Norbulingka Institute, which is dedicated to the preservation of the Tibetan culture, and in full detail on &quot;Study Buddhism&quot;. The progression can be summarised as follows: first of all, a monk of any Gelugpa monastery, who, after usually 15 to 20 years of study, achieves a &quot;Tsorampa&quot; or &quot;Lharampa&quot; (higher) Geshe degree, is obliged to enter either the Gyuto Tantric College or the Gyume Tantric College, depending on his place of origin in Tibet, to continue his studies. If, after one or two years further study he then qualifies as &quot;Ngagrampa&quot; Geshe, he can rise on merit to become a &quot;Geko&quot; or disciplinarian, then to become vice-abbot (tenure 3 years); then he can be chosen and appointed by the Dalai Lama as abbot of his respective college, with a tenure of a further 3 years.

On retirement as Abbot of Gyume or Gyuto, he becomes eligible to become, eventually, for former Gyume abbots the &quot;Jangtsey Chojey&quot; (&quot;Dharma Master of the Northern Peak of Ganden Hill&quot;), or for former Gyuto abbots the &quot;Sharpa Chojey&quot; (&quot;Dharma Master of the Eastern Peak of Ganden Hill&quot;). These are more elevated positions, above abbots and retired abbots, which are automatically accorded only to the senior-most surviving retired abbot, one from each respective college, with a tenure of 7 years.

The Ganden Tripa is an automatic appointment occurring once every 7 years, from one or the other of these two &quot;Chojeys&quot; or Dharma Masters, on an alternating basis. The incumbent Ganden Tripa stands down, and one of the two &quot;Chojeys&quot; is elevated. If the retiring Ganden Tripa is a former abbot of Gyume Tantric College, and thus a former &quot;Jangtsey Chojey&quot;, his replacement will be a former abbot of Gyuto Tantric College and thus the current &quot;Sharpa Chojey&quot; (and vice versa).

This appointment is automatic but is apparently confirmed by the Dalai Lama who, being the pre-eminent spiritual leader, publicly announces the appointment or nomination at the time of changeover. The Rizong Sre Rinpoche was the 102nd Ganden Tripa, he previously served as the abbot of both Gyume Tantric College and Drepung Loseling Monastery.

<text>Massawa or Mitsiwa ( ) is a port city in the Northern Red Sea region of Eritrea, located on the Red Sea at the northern end of the Gulf of Zula beside the Dahlak Archipelago. It has been a historically important port for many centuries. Massawa has been ruled or occupied by a succession of polities during its history, including the Kingdom of Aksum, the Ethiopian Empire, the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Italy.

Massawa was the capital of the Italian Colony of Eritrea until the seat of the colonial government was moved to Asmara in 1897.

Massawa has an average temperature of nearly , which is one of the highest experienced in the world, and is &quot;one of the hottest marine coastal areas in the world.&quot;

==History==

Massawa was originally a small seaside village, lying in lands coextensive with the Kingdom of Aksum and overshadowed by the nearby port of Adulis about to the south. Massawa was known to Arab geographers from an early period. Ya&#x27;qubi referred to the Red Sea port in his &quot;Kitab al-Buldan&quot; as &quot;Badi&quot;, a corruption of its local Tigre name &quot;Base&quot;, while al-Masudi spoke of it in 935 as &quot;Nase&quot;.

The city reputedly has the oldest mosque in Africa, the Mosque of the Companions. It was reportedly built by the companions of the Prophet who escaped persecution by Meccans. After the fall of Aksum in the 8th century, the area around Massawa and the town itself fell under the occupation of the Umayyad Caliphate from 702 to 750. The Beja people would also come to rule within Massawa during the Beja Kingdoms from the year 740 to the 14th century. At this time, the Sheikh Hanafi Mosque, one of Eritrea&#x27;s oldest mosques, was built on Massawa Island. Massawa was situated between the Kingdom of Qita&#x27;a, the Kingdom of Belgin, and the Sultanate of Dahlak.

In the early 15th century, the town then fell under the control of the Ethiopian Empire, Massawa was first mentioned in the war songs of Emperor Yeshaq I. In the mid-15th century Emperor Zara Yaqob consolidated his rule in the region and incorporated Massawa into the Christian province of Mereb Melash. During this time the port was frequented by Armenian and Venetian merchants.

=== Portuguese influence ===
In the struggle for domination of the Red Sea the Portuguese succeeded in establishing a foothold in Massawa (Maçua) and Arkiko in 1513 by Diogo Lopes de Albergaria, a port by which they entered the allied territory of Ethiopia in the fight against the Ottomans. King Manuel I first gave orders for the construction of a fortress that was never built. However, during Portuguese presence, it was lifted as well as the existing cisterns and wells for the Portuguese Navy watery. It was drawn by D. João de Castro in 1541 in his &quot;Roteiro do Mar Roxo&quot; in their route to attack El Tor and Suez. The captain of the Arkiko was the Portuguese Gonçalo Ferreira, second port on the coast that guaranteed the presence and maintenance of the Portuguese fleets, whenever the port of Massawa was threatened by the Turkish presence. In 1541 the Adalites ambushed the Portuguese at the Battle of Massawa.

=== Ottoman rule ===
Massawa rose to prominence when it was captured by the Ottoman Empire in 1557. The Ottomans tried to make it the capital of Habesh Eyalet. Under Özdemir Pasha, Ottoman troops then attempted to conquer the rest of Eritrea. Due to resistance as well as sudden and unexpected demands for more, the Ottomans did not conquer the rest of Eritrea. The Ottoman authorities then tried to place the city and its immediate hinterlands under the control of one of the aristocrats of the Bellou people, whom they wanted to appoint &quot;Naib of Massawa&quot; and almost made answerable to the Ottoman governor at Suakin. The Ottomans nevertheless built parts of the old town of Massawa on Massawa Island into a prominent port on the Red Sea. These buildings and the old town of Massawa remain to this day, having withstood both earthquakes and wars.

In June 1855, Emperor Tewodros II informed the British Consul, Walter Plowden, of his intention to occupy Tigray and make himself master of &quot;the tribes along the coast&quot;, he also informed Frederick Bruce that he was determined to seize the port because it was being used by the Turks as &quot;a deposit for kidnapped Christian children&quot; who were being exported as slaves. Both Bruce and Plowden were sympathetic to the Emperor, but the Foreign Office, who considered the Ottomans to be a useful British ally, refused to support the proposed Ethiopian annexation.
In May 1865, Massawa, and later much of the Northeast African coast of the Red Sea, came under the rule of the Khedive of Egypt with Ottoman consent. The Egyptians originally had a poor opinion of Massawa. Many of the buildings were in a poor state of repair and the Egyptian troops were forced to stay in tents. Sanitary conditions were likewise poor and cholera was endemic. Such considerations caused the Egyptians to contemplate abandonment of the port in favour of nearby Zula. However, the Egyptian governor, Werner Munzinger, was determined to improve the conditions of the port and began a programme of reconstruction. Work began in March 1872 when a new government building and customs house was constructed, and by June a school and a hospital was also established by the Egyptians.
Egyptian control of Massawa was threatened following the defeat at the Battle of Gura. After the Egyptian-Ethiopian War, Emperor Yohannes IV reportedly demanded that the Egyptians should cede both Zula and Arkiko and pay Ethiopia two million pounds in reparations or, failing this sum, grant him the port of Massawa. The Egyptians refused these demands and Yohannes ordered Ras Alula with 30,000 men to advanced on the port. The population was said to have been &quot;much alarmed&quot; at the Ethiopian show of force, however Alula soon returned to the highlands and the Egyptian control of the coastline remained unbroken.

===Italian colonization===
The British, feeling that the Egyptians were in no position to hold the port, and being unwilling to occupy it themselves or see it fall into the hands of the French, concurred in its seizure by the Italians in February 1885. In 1885–1897, Massawa (in the Italian spelling: &#x27;Massaua&#x27;) served as the capital of the region, before Governor Ferdinando Martini moved his administration to Asmara. Ras Alula&#x27;s attack on nearby Dogali helped precipitate the First Italo-Ethiopian War; the Italians&#x27; disastrous defeat at Adwa ended their hopes of expanding further into the Ethiopian highlands for a decade and brought Menelik II&#x27;s newly formed Ethiopian Empire international recognition.

The Italian colony suffered repeated earthquakes. Most of the city was completely destroyed by the 1921 earthquake; it took until 1928 to fully restore the port, hampering initially the Italian colonial ambitions.

Massawa became the largest and safest port on the east coast of Africa, and the largest deep-water port on the Red Sea. Between 1887 and 1932, they expanded the Eritrean Railway, connecting Massawa with Asmara and then Bishia near the Sudan border, and completed the Asmara-Massawa Cableway. At long, it was the longest ropeway conveyor in the world at the time.

In 1928, Massawa had 15,000 inhabitants, of which 2,500 were Italians: the city was improved with an architectural plan similar to the one in Asmara, with a commercial and industrial area. With the rise of Fascism a segregation policy was implemented and with the passing of the &quot;racial laws&quot; soon became a real system of apartheid. Natives were segregated from residential areas, bars and restaurants reserved for the white population. However these laws did not stop relationships between Italian men and Eritrean women in the colonial territories. The result was a growing number of meticci (mulattos). Though the chief port of Italian Eritrea, Emilio De Bono who inspected the harbor in 1932 reported that the port had to be reconditioned as it was &quot;absolutely lacking in wharves and facilities for the rapid landing and discharge of cargoes.&quot; As a result, the quays were widened, the breakwater lengthened to enable the simultaneous discharge of five steamers and the harbour was equipped with two large cranes.

During the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, Massawa served as a base for the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, which caused the town to be flooded with Italian soldiers. An American journalist reported at the height of the invasion, &quot;The streets had obviously sprung up over night. Men slept in completely open barracks - just a skeleton frame-work of wood with galvanized iron roof.&quot;

During World War II Massawa was the homeport for the Red Sea Flotilla of the Italian Royal Navy. When the city fell during the East African Campaign, a large number of Italian and German ships were sunk in an attempt to block use of Massawa&#x27;s harbour.

From 15 April 1942, later master diver and salvage specialist RNR Lieutenant Peter Keeble (then a complete rookie in both disciplines) was assigned to the clearing of the harbour. He succeeded only in the simple task of salvaging an ex-Italian tugboat. The same month, United States Navy Commander Edward Ellsberg and his handful of crew arrived to take over. The wrecks were salvaged in short order and the port was returned to service, as part of what had now become the British protectorate of Eritrea. The port&#x27;s floating drydocks were of significant importance in maintaining and repairing Royal Navy ships and British civilian transports from the Mediterranean, which would otherwise have to travel to South Africa to reach suitable shipyards and docks. 

In 1945, following the end of World War II, the port of Massawa suffered damage as the occupying British either dismantled or destroyed much of the facilities. These actions were protested by Sylvia Pankhurst in her book &quot;Eritrea on the Eve&quot;.

===Ethiopian rule===

From 1952 to 1990, when Eritrea had entered into a federation with Ethiopia, previously landlocked Ethiopia briefly enjoyed the use of Massawa as the headquarters of the Ethiopian Navy. Ultimately, Ethiopia terminated the federation and forcibly incorporated Eritrea. This led to the Eritrean War of Independence (1961–1991). Massawa was fought over by both sides during the struggle for Eritrean independence. In February 1990, Massawa was captured by the Eritrean People&#x27;s Liberation Front in a surprise attack from both land and sea during the Second Battle of Massawa. The battle, also known as Operation Fenkil, utilized both infiltrated commandos and speed boats. The success of this attack cut the major supply line to the Second Ethiopian Army in Asmara, which then had to be supplied by air. In response, the then leader of Ethiopia Mengistu Haile Mariam ordered Massawa bombed from the air, resulting in considerable damage.

===Eritrean independence===

With Eritrea&#x27;s de facto independence (complete military liberation) in 1991, Ethiopia reverted to being landlocked and its Navy was dismantled (partially taken over by the nascent national navy of Eritrea).

During the Eritrean–Ethiopian War the port was inactive, primarily due to the closing of the Eritrean-Ethiopian border which cut off Massawa from its traditional hinterlands. A large grain vessel donated by the United States, containing 15,000 tonnes of relief food, which docked at the port late in 2001, was the first significant shipment handled by the port since the war began.

==Transportation==
Massawa is home to a naval base and large dhow docks. It also has a station on the railway line to Asmara. Ferries sail to the Dahlak Islands and the nearby Sheikh Saeed Island.

In addition, the city&#x27;s air transportation needs are served by the Massawa International Airport.

==Main sights==
Buildings in the city include the shrine of Sahaba, as well as the 15th century Sheikh Hanafi Mosque and various houses of coral. Many buildings, for example some unfinished Ottoman buildings, survive. The local bazaar as well. Later buildings include the Imperial Palace, built in 1872 to 1874 for Werner Munzinger; St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral; and the 1920s Banca d&#x27;Italia. The Eritrean War of Independence is commemorated in a memorial of three tanks in the middle of Massawa.

==Climate==

Massawa has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). The city receives a very low average annual rainfall amount totalling around and consistently experiences soaringly high temperatures during both day and night. The annual mean average temperature approaches , which is one of the highest found in the world. Massawa is noted for its very high summer humidity despite being a desert city. This combination of the desert heat and high humidity makes the apparent temperatures seem even more extreme. The sky is usually clear and bright throughout the year.

<doc id="555926" wikidata="Q333913" url="?curid=555926" title="Joseph Martin (Canadian politician)">
<text>Joseph Martin (24 September 1852 – 2 March 1923) was a lawyer and politician in Manitoba, British Columbia and the United Kingdom often referred to as &quot;Fighting Joe&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Milton, Canada West, the son of Edward Martin, a former Reeve, and Mary Ann Fleming, Martin was educated at the Milton public school, the Toronto Normal School and University of Toronto. He was a telegraph operator and afterwards obtained a First-class Teacher&#x27;s certificate, and was appointed principal of the public school in New Edinburgh, Ontario. He studied law in Ottawa and moved to Portage la Prairie, Manitoba in 1882. He was called to the Bar of Manitoba in 1882.

==Political career==

===Manitoba===
He was first elected as the member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for the Portage la Prairie riding in 1883 and served as Attorney-General in the government of Thomas Greenway. In 1890, he initiated legislation to end French language instruction and support for Catholic separate schools, prompting the Manitoba Schools Question crisis.

===Canada===
Martin ran unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate in the 1891 election to become the Member of Parliament for Selkirk. When Sir Hugh Macdonald resigned his Winnipeg seat, Martin ran in the 1893 by-election and won by acclamation. He lost the seat to Macdonald when they both ran for re-election in Selkirk in the 1896 election. He later ran in the 1908 election as an independent in the Vancouver City federal riding but was not elected.

===British Columbia===
After his defeat in Manitoba, Martin left for British Columbia to settle in Vancouver. He arrived at a time of booming prosperity. He took up the practice of law and made a fortune developing the Hastings Manor subdivision in Vancouver.

Martin was first elected to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly in 1898 election in the multi-member Vancouver City riding. The election did not yield a majority for any one party. With increased representation for mainland ridings and a shift in popular support from the Turner government, a government of special interests, railway industrialists, coal barons, lumber and fishing capitalists, Turner&#x27;s support fell to 17 of 38 seats. Lieutenant-Governor Thomas R. McInnes dismissed Turner on 8 August 1898 without allowing him the constitutional right to meet the legislature. Instead he turned to former premier Robert Beaven, even though he had not been elected in his constituency, to form a government. He was unable to do so, and McInnes then turned to Charles Semlin to form a government. Semlin took office as premier and chose Martin as his Attorney-General. Martin also served as the Acting Minister of Education from 17 August 1898 to 9 March 1899 and as the Acting Provincial Secretary from 17 to 20 August 1898.

During the two year Semlin government, Martin produced controversy by introducing measures such as an eight-hour work day (opposed by mine owners) and an Alien Exclusion Act to prevent Chinese from owning mining claims. The federal government, at the instance of American interests, took steps to disallow the legislation. During a controversial public meeting about the issue, Martin breached cabinet solidarity and criticized his own government resulting in a request from Premier Semlin for Martin&#x27;s resignation. Semlin reconstituted his ministries and met the legislature facing strong opposition from Martin, often requiring the Speaker of the house to break ties by using his casting vote. On 27 February 1900 McInnes dismissed Semlin and, the following day, asked Martin to form a government. The result was a vote of non-confidence by the house which carried by a majority of 28 to 1. Nevertheless, Martin formed a cabinet and continued in government.

Martin quickly took positions on leading questions of the day in order to have an election platform. He endorsed government ownership of railways and the principle of an eight-hour work day. He also attempted to introduce partisanship by appointing a cabinet of Liberal supporters, but the move was opposed by the British Columbia Liberal Association.

The 1900 election was a defeat for Martin, as only five of his supporters were elected. Following the election, Prime Minister Laurier dismissed McInnes and appointed Sir Henri-Gustave Joly de Lotbinière as lieutenant governor. The legislature was able to agree to support James Dunsmuir to lead a government. Martin moved to the opposition, but the press noted &quot;extreme friendliness&quot; between him and Dunsmuir and he often spoke in favour of the government. During this time, the Liberals dropped their opposition to party politics and elected Martin as their leader. Martin then claimed to be the leader of the Opposition, though continued to co-operate with the Dunsmuir government.

He was defeated in the 1903 election, the first in British Columbia organized on party lines.

In 1907, he founded the &quot;Vancouver Guardian&quot; newspaper. After his return from England, he ran in the 1920 election in Vancouver as an Independent under the banner of the Asiatic Exclusion League. He was defeated and lost his deposit.

Martin, who died of complications from diabetes in March 1923, was the first person in Vancouver to be treated with insulin.

===United Kingdom===
He moved to the United Kingdom where he won a seat in the British House of Commons as a Liberal Member of Parliament for St Pancras East. He served from 1910 until 1918.

In December 1911, Winston Churchill, then the First Lord of the Admiralty, had announced to the House of Commons that the British fleet was ready for war. Martin fiercely attacked the Admiralty over the grounding of the warship &quot;Niobe&quot; &quot;only to be completely and unceremoniously silenced by a biting answer from the First Lord.&quot;

The St Pancras East Liberal Association and Martin had a difficult relationship. By 1914 the association did not want Martin to continue as their MP and in May selected Richard Leopold Reiss to be their candidate for the general election expected to be called late 1914/early 1915. Martin said he would resign his seat and contest the resulting by-election as an Independent Lib-Lab candidate. Confronted with the prospect of losing the by-election to the Unionist, due to a split Liberal vote, the Liberal association told Martin in June that they would not contest the by-election. In July Martin announced that he would instead resign his seat and return to his native Canada, allowing Reiss to run against a Unionist in the by-election. Martin changed his mind again and decided not to resign his seat. In August war was declared, the general election was deferred, Reiss resigned as candidate to enlisted and Martin continued as MP.

Relations between Martin and his local Liberal association continued to be uncertain. Finally he crossed the floor to join the Labour Party. In early 1918 he was selected to run as Labour candidate in neighbouring Islington South. However, by close of nominations, there was no Labour candidate nominated.

Martin was also a candidate for mayor of Vancouver in 1914 and founded another newspaper there in 1916.

<doc id="555928" wikidata="Q1569151" url="?curid=555928" title="Sender Policy Framework">
<text>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication method that ensures the sending mail server is authorized to originate mail from the email sender&#x27;s domain. This authentication only applies to the email sender listed in the &quot;envelope from&quot; field during the initial SMTP connection. If the email is bounced, a message is sent to this address, and for downstream transmission it typically appears in the &quot;Return-Path&quot; header. To authenticate the email address which is actually visible to recipients on the &quot;From:&quot; line, other technologies, such as DMARC, must be used. Forgery of this address is known as email spoofing, and is often used in phishing and email spam.

The list of authorized sending hosts and IP addresses for a domain is published in the DNS records for that domain. Sender Policy Framework is defined in RFC 7208 dated April 2014 as a &quot;proposed standard&quot;.

==History==
The first public mention of the concept was in 2000 but went mostly unnoticed. No mention was made of the concept again until a first attempt at an SPF-like specification was published in 2002 on the IETF &quot;namedroppers&quot; mailing list by Dana Valerie Reese, who was unaware of the 2000 mention of the idea. The very next day, Paul Vixie posted his own SPF-like specification on the same list. These posts ignited a lot of interest, led to the forming of the IETF Anti-Spam Research Group (ASRG) and their mailing list, where the SPF idea was further developed. Among the proposals submitted to the ASRG were &quot;Reverse MX&quot; (RMX) by Hadmut Danisch, and &quot;Designated Mailer Protocol&quot; (DMP) by Gordon Fecyk.

In June 2003, Meng Weng Wong merged the RMX and DMP specifications and solicited suggestions from others. Over the next six months, a large number of changes were made and a large community had started working on SPF. Originally SPF stood for &quot;Sender Permitted From&quot; and was sometimes also called &quot;SMTP+SPF&quot;; but its name was changed to &quot;Sender Policy Framework&quot; in February 2004.

In early 2004, the IETF created the MARID working group and tried to use SPF and Microsoft&#x27;s CallerID proposal as the basis for what is now known as Sender ID; but this collapsed due to technical and licensing conflicts.

The SPF community returned to the original &quot;classic&quot; version of SPF. In July 2005, this version of the specification was approved by the IESG as an IETF &quot;experiment&quot;, inviting the community to observe SPF during the two years following publication. On April 28, 2006, the SPF RFC was published as experimental RFC 4408.

In April 2014 IETF published SPF in RFC 7208 as a &quot;proposed standard&quot;.

==Principles of operation==
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol permits any computer to send email claiming to be from any source address. This is exploited by spammers and scammers who often use forged email addresses, making it more difficult to trace a message back to its source, and easy for spammers to hide their identity in order to avoid responsibility. It is also used in phishing techniques, where users can be duped into disclosing private information in response to an email purportedly sent by an organization such as a bank.

SPF allows the owner of an Internet domain to specify which computers are authorized to send mail with envelope-from addresses in that domain, using Domain Name System (DNS) records. Receivers verifying the SPF information in TXT records may reject messages from unauthorized sources before receiving the body of the message. Thus, the principles of operation are similar to those of DNS-based blackhole lists (DNSBL), except that SPF uses the authority delegation scheme of the Domain Name System. Current practice requires the use of TXT records, just as early implementations did. For a while a new record type (SPF, type 99) was registered and made available in common DNS software. Use of TXT records for SPF was intended as a transitional mechanism at the time. The experimental RFC, RFC 4408, section 3.1.1, suggested &quot;an SPF-compliant domain name SHOULD have SPF records of both RR types&quot;. The proposed standard, RFC 7208, says &quot;use of alternative DNS RR types was supported in SPF&#x27;s experimental phase but has been discontinued&quot;.

The envelope-from address is transmitted at the beginning of the SMTP dialog. If the server rejects the domain, the unauthorized client should receive a rejection message, and if that client was a relaying message transfer agent (MTA), a bounce message to the original envelope-from address may be generated. If the server accepts the domain, and subsequently also accepts the recipients and the body of the message, it should insert a Return-Path field in the message header in order to save the envelope-from address. While the address in the Return-Path often matches other originator addresses in the mail header such as the &quot;header-from&quot;, this is not necessarily the case, and SPF does not prevent forgery of these other addresses such as &quot;sender&quot; header.

Spammers can send email with an SPF PASS result if they have an account in a domain with a sender policy, or abuse a compromised system in this domain. However, doing so makes the spammer easier to trace.

The main benefit of SPF is to the owners of email addresses that are forged in the Return-Path. They receive large numbers of unsolicited error messages and other auto-replies. If such receivers use SPF to specify their legitimate source IP addresses and indicate FAIL result for all other addresses, receivers checking SPF can reject forgeries, thus reducing or eliminating the amount of backscatter.

SPF has potential advantages beyond helping identify unwanted mail. In particular, if a sender provides SPF information, then receivers can use SPF PASS results in combination with an allow list to identify known reliable senders. Scenarios like compromised systems and shared sending mailers limit this use.

===Reasons to implement===
If a domain publishes an SPF record, spammers and phishers are less likely to forge emails pretending to be from that domain, because the forged emails are more likely to be caught in spam filters which check the SPF record. Therefore, an SPF-protected domain is less attractive to spammers and phishers. Because an SPF-protected domain is less attractive as a spoofed address, it is less likely to be denylisted by spam filters and so ultimately the legitimate email from the domain is more likely to get through.

===FAIL and forwarding===
SPF breaks plain message forwarding. When a domain publishes an SPF FAIL policy, legitimate messages sent to receivers forwarding their mail to third parties may be rejected and/or bounced if all of the following occur:
# The forwarder does not rewrite the Return-Path, unlike mailing lists.
# The next hop does not allowlist the forwarder.
# This hop checks SPF.
This is a necessary and obvious feature of SPF – checks &quot;behind&quot; the &quot;border&quot; MTA (MX) of the receiver cannot work directly.

Publishers of SPF FAIL policies must accept the risk of their legitimate emails being rejected or bounced. They should test (e.g., with a SOFTFAIL policy) until they are satisfied with the results. See below for a list of alternatives to plain message forwarding.

===HELO tests===
For an empty Return-Path as used in error messages and other auto-replies, an SPF check of the HELO identity is mandatory.

With a bogus HELO identity the result NONE would not help, but for valid host names SPF also protects the HELO identity. This SPF feature was always supported as an option for receivers, and later SPF drafts including the final specification recommend to check the HELO always.

This allows receivers to allowlist sending mailers based on a HELO PASS, or to reject all mails after a HELO FAIL. It can also be used in reputation systems (any allow or deny list is a simple case of a reputation system).

==Implementation==
Compliance with SPF consists of three loosely related tasks:
* Publishing a policy: Domains and hosts identify the machines authorized to send email on their behalf. They do this by adding additional records to their existing DNS information: every domain name or host that has an A record or MX record should have an SPF record specifying the policy if it is used either in an email address or as HELO/EHLO argument. Hosts which do not send mail should have an SPF record published which indicate such (&quot;v=spf1 -all&quot;). 
* Checking and using SPF information: Receivers use ordinary DNS queries, which are typically cached to enhance performance. Receivers then interpret the SPF information as specified and act upon the result.
* Revising mail forwarding: Plain mail forwarding is not allowed by SPF. The alternatives are:
** Remailing (i.e., replacing the original sender with one belonging to the local domain)
** Refusing (e.g., answering codice_1)
** Allowlisting on the target server, so that it will not refuse a forwarded message
** Sender Rewriting Scheme, a more complicated mechanism that handles routing non-delivery notifications to the original sender

Thus, the key issue in SPF is the specification for the new DNS information that domains set and receivers use. The records laid out below are in typical DNS syntax, for example:

 &quot;v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 ip4:198.51.100.123 a -all&quot;

&quot;v=&quot; defines the version of SPF used. The following words provide &quot;mechanisms&quot; to use to determine if a domain is eligible to send mail. The &quot;ip4&quot; and &quot;a&quot; specify the systems permitted to send messages for the given domain. The &quot;-all&quot; at the end specifies that, if the previous &quot;mechanisms&quot; did not match, the message should be rejected.

===Mechanisms===
Eight &quot;mechanisms&quot; are defined:
===Qualifiers===
Each &quot;mechanism&quot; can be combined with one of four &quot;qualifiers&quot;:
* codice_2 for a PASS result. This can be omitted; e.g., codice_3 is the same as codice_4.
* codice_5 for a NEUTRAL result interpreted like NONE (no policy).
* codice_6 (tilde) for SOFTFAIL, a debugging aid between NEUTRAL and FAIL. Typically, messages that return a SOFTFAIL are accepted but tagged.
* codice_7 (minus) for FAIL, the mail should be rejected (see below).

===Modifiers===
The &quot;modifiers&quot; allow for future extensions to the framework. To date only the two &quot;modifiers&quot; defined in the RFC 4408 have been widely deployed:
*codice_8 gives the name of a domain with a DNS TXT record (interpreted using SPF&#x27;s macro language) to get an explanation for FAIL results—typically a URL which is added to the SMTP error code. This feature is rarely used.
*codice_9 can be used instead of the ALL-&quot;mechanism&quot; to link to the policy record of another domain. This &quot;modifier&quot; is easier to understand than the somewhat similar INCLUDE-&quot;mechanism&quot;.

===Error handling===
As soon as SPF implementations detect syntax errors in a sender policy they must abort the evaluation with result PERMERROR. Skipping erroneous &quot;mechanisms&quot; cannot work as expected, therefore codice_10 and codice_11 also cause a PERMERROR.

Another safeguard is the maximum of ten mechanisms querying DNS, i.e. any mechanism except from IP4, IP6, and ALL. Implementations can abort the evaluation with result TEMPERROR when it takes too long or a DNS query times out or they can continue pretending that the query returned no data —which is called a &quot;void lookup&quot;. However, they must return PERMERROR if the policy directly or indirectly needs more than ten queries for &quot;mechanisms&quot;. In addition, they should return PERMERROR as soon as more than two &quot;void lookups&quot; have been encountered. Any codice_12 also counts towards this &quot;processing limits&quot;.

A typical SPF HELO policy codice_13 may execute four or more DNS queries: (1) TXT record (SPF type was obsoleted by RFC 7208), (2) A or AAAA for mechanism codice_14, (3) MX record and (4+) A or AAAA for each MX name, for mechanism codice_4. Except the first one, all those queries count towards the limit of 10. In addition if, for example, the sender has an IPv6 address, while its name and its two MX names have only IPv4 addresses, then the evaluation of the first two mechanisms already results in more than two void lookups and hence PERMERROR. Mechanisms codice_16, codice_17 and codice_18 need no DNS lookup.

==Issues==
=== DNS SPF Records ===
To enable rapid testing and deployment, initial versions of SPF checked for its setting in the DNS TXT record of the sending domain - even though this record was traditionally supposed to be free-form text with no semantics attached. Although in July 2005, IANA assigned a specific Resource Record type 99 to SPF the uptake of was never high, and having two mechanisms was confusing for users. In 2014 the use of this record was discontinued after the SPFbis working group concluded that &quot; ...significant migration to the SPF RR type in the foreseeable future was very unlikely and that the best solution for resolving this interoperability issue was to drop support for the SPF RR type.&quot;

=== Header limitations ===
As SPF increasingly prevents spammers from spoofing the envelope-from address, many have moved to only spoof the address in the From field of the mail header, which is actually displayed to the recipient rather than only processed by the recipient&#x27;s message transfer agent (MTA). SPF (or DKIM) can be used together with DMARC though, to also check the From field of the mail header. This is called &#x27;identifier alignment&#x27;. 

Custom proprietary implementations are required to protect against such display name spoofing and cannot utilize SPF.

==Deployment==
Anti-spam software such as SpamAssassin version 3.0.0 and ASSP implement SPF. Many mail transfer agents (MTAs) support SPF directly such as Courier, CommuniGate Pro, Wildcat, MDaemon, and Microsoft Exchange, or have patches or plug-ins available that support SPF, including Postfix, Sendmail, Exim, qmail, and Qpsmtpd. As of 2017, more than eight million domains publish SPF FAIL codice_19 policies. In a survey published in 2007, 5% of the codice_20 and codice_21 domains had some kind of SPF policy. In 2009, a continuous survey run at Nokia Research reports that 51% of the tested domains specify an SPF policy. These results can include trivial policies like codice_22. 

In April 2007, BITS, a division of the Financial Services Roundtable, published email security recommendations for its members including SPF deployment. In 2008, the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG) published a paper about email authentication covering SPF, Sender ID, and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM). In their &quot;Sender Best Communication Practices&quot; the MAAWG stated: &quot;At the very least, senders should incorporate SPF records for their mailing domains&quot;. In 2015, the Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG) revised a paper about email authentication covering SPF, DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM), and DMARC (DMARC). In their revised &quot;Sender Best Communication Practices&quot; the MAAWG stated: &quot;Authentication supports transparency by further identifying the sender(s) of a message, while also contributing to the reduction or elimination of spoofed and forged addresses&quot;.

From February 1, 2024, Google requires SPF or DKIM for all domains sending emails to Gmail accounts. Bulk senders (5000+ emails per day) are required to have SPF, DKIM, and DMARC setup for their domains.

<text>Orders is a surname.

==Etymology==
The etymology of &#x27;Orders&#x27; is unclear, although there are records extant dating the surname in its current spelling back to the 17th century in the Warminster region of Wiltshire and the 16th century in Cambridgeshire, England. The root of the name in its possible variant spelling forms can be ALD, AUD, OLD or ORD to which have been added a suffix such as AS, ES, ERS, IS, OS, US, etc. &#x27;Orders&#x27; therefore has many possible genealogical or historical derivations which are affiliated in common via the shared modern spelling.

==Derivation==
The modern surname is now found in many parts of the world, and suggestions as to its historical roots include:
*that it is an alternative spelling of AUDAS, which itself comes from two distinct sources, one of early medieval English origin and one of Scottish origin. The English form of the name derives from the Middle English female personal name &quot;Aldus&quot;, itself a pet form of any of the numerous Olde English pre 7th Century male and female personal names with &quot;(e)ald&quot;, old, as its first element. For example &quot;Radulfus filius (son of) Alduse&quot; is said to be noted in the 1168 Pipe Rolls of Yorkshire. The Scottish form of the surname is locational from Auldhous, in Strathclyde (Renfrewshire). The placename derives from the Olde English &quot;eald&quot; old, with &quot;hus&quot;, house, hence &quot;old house&quot;.
*it may be part of a locational name from a place called Ord in Northumberland, deriving from the Old English pre-7th Century &quot;ord&quot; or &quot;orde&quot; meaning &quot;point&quot;. This may refer to a headland, a certain geographical &#x27;point&#x27;, a long ridge or someone dwelling at one these locales. 
*it may be an Anglicized form of the Germanic personal name Ort, a short form of the various compound names, such as ORDERS, with the first element meaning &quot;point&quot; (for example of a sword, spear, hill, or army). &#x27;Hare&#x27;, or &#x27;army&#x27; in old-German, is thought to have been the second element in the compound &#x27;ord-hare&#x27; leading to &#x27;orders&#x27;.
*in its many different spellings from Ort, Imort, and Delort, to Horta, Huerta and Hurtic, this is a surname of French, Spanish, Portuguese and German derivation. The origin is usually pre-5th century C.E. German or Visigoth, the latter tribe being the conquerors of the Spanish region in the period between the 6th and 8th centuries. As a result, many, perhaps the majority of popular Spanish and Portuguese surnames have some Germanic influence. In this case the surname is topographical and generally describes a person who lived in an &#x27;ort&#x27;, this being a settlement on the top of a hill, or in the case of the French nameholders, in a walled area, probably a defensive fortress. In some case the surname may have been descriptive for a soldier who carried an &#x27;ort&#x27;, this being a spear or lance.
*it may derive its origin from Orderic Vitalis or his father, Odelerius of Orleans, a priest who came to England with William the Conqueror.
*the Oxford University Press Names Companion lists under the surname of ORT a Southern French (Provençal or Occitan) root that stems from the Latin &#x27;HORTUS&#x27;, Latin for &#x27;garden&#x27; or &#x27;gardener&#x27;. This has been corrupted into the variants ORT, ORTS, ORS and ORTELLS, and thus possibly ORDERS. 
*the Anglo-Saxon name stem &#x27;Ord-&#x27; or &#x27;Orde-&#x27; was sometimes taken to mean &#x27;Prince&#x27; or &#x27;Chief&#x27;.
*As a possible variant of ORDISH, from the Old English compound of Ord(a), a personal name or word suggesting a &#x27;point&#x27;, &#x27;tip&#x27;, &#x27;extremity&#x27;, &#x27;promontory&#x27;, or Ora, Old English for a topographical &#x27;bank&#x27;, and Edisc, meaning park or pastureland. This possible source of &#x27;Orders&#x27; as a surname appears to stem from the hilly ridge near Ashover in Derbyshire known as High Oredish, reputed to be an area of rural beauty and fine views. 
*it may be a Scottish locational name from various minor places named with the Gaelic &quot;ord&quot; meaning &quot;hammer&quot;, which is used as a topographical term for a rounded or conical hill.

==Notable people==
*James Orders was awarded a medal for his part in the Battle of Waterloo, 1815.
*Jonathan Orders, English-born cricketer

<text>Madman (Philip Sterns) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Peter David and artist Jeff Purves, the character first appeared in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2 #362 (November 1989). He is portrayed as one of the Hulk&#x27;s enemies and as the brother of the Leader. 

==Publication history==
Philip Sterns debuted in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2 #362 (November 1989), and as the Madman in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2 #364, created by Peter David and Jeff Purves.

==Fictional character biography==
Philip Sterns is a former classmate of Bruce Banner at the California Institute of Technology who became envious of the Hulk and transformed himself into a red Hulk-like monster using gamma rays to emulate him. In the process, Sterns develops an evil alternate personality who begins manipulating him.

In subsequent appearances, Madman comes into conflict with the Hulk before being killed by the Leader in a confrontation with the Thunderbolts and sent to Hell to be tortured.

==Powers and abilities==
Like the Hulk, the Madman has immense strength and durability. He is unable to grow in strength further, but possesses additional shapeshifting abilities. He is also a gifted genius, with knowledge in nuclear physics and robotics.

<text>Chelmsford 123 is a British television situation comedy produced for Channel 4 by Hat Trick Productions. It originally ran for two series, of six and seven episodes respectively, in 1988 and 1990.

The series is set in the British town of Chelmsford in the year AD 123 and concerned the power struggle between Roman governor Aulus Paulinus (Jimmy Mulville) and the British chieftain, Badvoc (Rory McGrath). Britain is a miserable place, cold and wet – just the place to exile Aulus for accidentally insulting the Emperor&#x27;s horse, but it also give him something useful to do. Aulus (probably a play on Aulus Platorius Nepos, the real governor of Roman Britain between 122 and 125) is a rather delicate Roman and is usually outwitted by the scheming Badvoc, who has not had a haircut for twenty-five years. There are also appearances by many of the other regular &quot;Hat Trick&quot; actors, previously seen in shows such as &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;.

Both series are available to stream on Channel 4, and have been shown in the UK on Rewind TV. 

Series 1 and 2 were released on DVD by Acorn Media UK on 15 September 2011.

<text>The National Centre for Popular Music was a museum in Sheffield, England, for pop and rock music and contemporary culture generally, a £15 million project largely funded with contributions from the National Lottery, which opened on 1 March 1999, and closed in June 2000. However, the plan for the centre was devised in the mid-1980s and Sheffield City Council were aiming to raise the money for it in April 1993 so the concept long predated the Tony Blair / Cool Britannia era of which it was seen as a notable failure.

==Building==
The building, designed by Branson Coates following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions, consists of four giant stainless steel drums, surrounding an atrium area, the upper floor of which has a glazed roof.

Each of the drums has a rotating turret with a nozzle which is meant to turn with the wind and vent air. On the other side, an opening facing the wind takes inlet air down through wall cavities, being heated or cooled as required. Air is drawn out of the nozzle by buoyancy and wind pressure.

The ground floor contained office space, a shop, a bar, a café and a further exhibition space. Access to this floor was free, with only the top floor forming the museum.

==Closure==
The centre was one of the UK&#x27;s Millennium Commission projects, developed to celebrate the turn of the millennium. Other Commission funded projects included the Millennium Dome and the London Eye.

However the Centre failed to attract enough visitors and cash flow to ensure its viability for its 79 workers – BBC News described the centre as having been &quot;shunned&quot; by visitors, and, despite a £2 million relaunch, the Centre closed in 2000.

Ticket prices were about £21 for a family of four. It was hoped to attract 400,000 visitors a year. After seven months, there had been 104,000 visitors, and on 18 October 1999 the building&#x27;s owners, Music Heritage Ltd, called in PricewaterhouseCoopers to administer its day-to-day running. The company was to be liquidated in that November if administration was not successful. It was saved in the interim although £1.1 million was owed to 200 creditors. The estimate of visitors per year was reduced to 150,000. Martin King, the chief executive who took over from Stuart Rogers, resigned in January 2000.

Just prior to closure, BBC Radio 2 held an event hosted by Billy Bragg and attended by around 75 prizewinners, to see Madness perform live with support from Paul Carrack.

==Subsequent use==
The building became a live music venue for a period from July 2001, then in 2003 Sheffield Hallam University bought it from Yorkshire Forward for £1.85 million. It was the university&#x27;s students&#x27; union until 2024, when the students&#x27; union made plans to move out. The future of the buildings is yet to be confirmed, though demolition has not been ruled out.

== History ==

===Early history===
The mountainous areas of Wakasa do not appear to have supported a population in early Japanese history. No remains from the Jōmon (14,000 – 300 BCE) or Yayoi 300 BCE – 250 CE) periods have been found in Wakasa. The town had two or three small settlements in the Kofun period (250–538). Wakasa became part of Yakami District in Inaba Province early in recorded Japanese history. Settlements in the area are appeared early in the Heian period (794–1185), and the name of a village called &quot;Wakasa&quot; first appear in the historical record this time. The Yabe clan controlled Wakasa throughout the Heian period to the end of the Kamakura period (1185 – 1333). The Yabe built Wakasa Oniga Castle in this period. The existence of the Yabe clan and Oniga castle are noted in the Taiheiki, a Japanese historical epic written in the late 14th century.

===Later history===
Wakasa, located in a richly forested area of the Chūgoku Mountains, was a source of lumber and lumber products from early times. The production of raw timber, planks, charcoal, and firewood is noted as early as the Kamakura period. These products, as well as rice, were transported on the Hattō River for export to other parts of Japan via the Japan Sea. At the beginning of the Edo period (1603–1868) the Tokugawa shogunate developed land for rice paddies in Wakasa as part of a nationwide effort to increase rice production in Japan. The mountainous areas of Wakasa provided extensive irrigation for rice-producing areas in the flatlands of the lower Sendai River, but Wakasa suffered frequent flooding from the Hattō River, notably in 1815 and 1888. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868 Wakasa became part of the newly formed Tottori Prefecture. The town was officially incorporated under administrative reforms by the Meiji government in 1889.

==Government==

<doc id="555979" wikidata="Q570623" url="?curid=555979" title="Contronym">
<text>A contronym is a word with two opposite meanings. For example, the word &quot;&quot; can mean &quot;authentic, traditional&quot;, or &quot;novel, never done before&quot;. This feature is also called enantiosemy, enantionymy (&quot;&quot; means &quot;opposite&quot;), antilogy or autoantonymy. An enantiosemic term is by definition polysemic.

== Nomenclature ==
A contronym is alternatively called an &quot;autantonym&quot;, &quot;auto-antonym&quot;, &quot;antagonym&quot;, &quot;enantiodrome&quot;, &quot;enantionym&quot;, &quot;Janus word&quot; (after the Roman god Janus, who is usually depicted with two faces), &quot;self-antonym&quot;, &quot;antilogy&quot;, or &quot;addad&quot; (Arabic, singular &quot;didd&quot;).

== Linguistic mechanisms ==

Some pairs of contronyms are true homographs, i.e., distinct words with different etymologies which happen to have the same form. For instance &quot;cleave&quot; &quot;separate&quot; is from Old English &quot;clēofan&quot;, while &quot;cleave&quot; &quot;adhere&quot; is from Old English &quot;clifian&quot;, which was pronounced differently.

Other contronyms are a form of polysemy, but where a single word acquires different and ultimately opposite definitions. For example, &quot;sanction&quot;—&quot;permit&quot; or &quot;penalize&quot;; &quot;bolt&quot; (originally from crossbows)—&quot;leave quickly&quot; or &quot;fix/immobilize&quot;; &quot;fast&quot;—&quot;moving rapidly&quot; or &quot;fixed in place&quot;. Some English examples result from nouns being verbed in the patterns of &quot;add &lt;noun&gt; to&quot; and &quot;remove &lt;noun&gt; from&quot;; e.g. &quot;dust&quot;, &quot;seed&quot;, &quot;stone&quot;. Denotations and connotations can drift or branch over centuries. An apocryphal story relates how Charles II (or sometimes Queen Anne) described St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (using contemporaneous English) as &quot;&quot;, with the meaning (rendered in modern English) of &quot;awe-inspiring, majestic, and ingeniously designed.&quot; 

Negative words such as and &quot;sick&quot; sometimes acquire ironic senses by antiphrasis referring to traits that are impressive and admired, if not necessarily positive (&quot;that outfit is bad as hell&quot;; &quot;lyrics full of sick burns&quot;).

Some contronyms result from differences in varieties of English. For example, to &quot;table&quot; a bill means &quot;to put it up for debate&quot; in British English, while it means &quot;to remove it from debate&quot; in American English (where British English would have &quot;shelve&quot;, which in this sense has an identical meaning in American English). To &quot;&quot;, in Australian English, is to loudly demonstrate support, while in British English it is to express disapproval and contempt.

In Latin, has the double meaning &quot;sacred, holy&quot; and &quot;accursed, infamous&quot;. Greek gave Latin its , from which English got its &quot;&quot;, which can refer either to God as the creator or to the devil, depending on philosophical context.

In some languages, a word stem associated with a single event may treat the action of that event as unitary, so in translation it may appear contronymic. For example, Latin can be translated as both &quot;guest&quot; and &quot;host&quot;. In some varieties of English, &quot;&quot; may mean both &quot;borrow&quot; and &quot;lend&quot;.

== Examples ==
=== English ===

* &quot;Original&quot; can mean &quot;authentic, traditional&quot;, or &quot;novel, never done before&quot; 
* &quot;Cleave&quot; can mean &quot;to cling&quot; or &quot;to split apart&quot;.
* &quot;Clip&quot; can mean &quot;attach&quot; or &quot;cut off&quot;. 
* &quot;Dust&quot; can mean &quot;to remove dust&quot; (cleaning a house) or &quot;to add dust&quot; (e.g., to dust a cake with powdered sugar).
* &quot;Fast&quot; can mean &quot;without moving; fixed in place&quot;, (holding fast, also as in &quot;steadfast&quot;), or &quot;moving quickly&quot;.
* &quot;Obbligato&quot; in music traditionally means a passage is &quot;obligatory&quot; but has also been used to mean &quot;optional&quot;.
* &quot;Overlook&quot; can mean &quot;to make an accidental omission or error&quot; or &quot;to engage in close scrutiny or control&quot;.
* &quot;Oversight&quot; can mean &quot;accidental omission or error&quot; or &quot;close scrutiny or control&quot;.
* &quot;Peruse&quot; can mean to &quot;consider with attention and in detail&quot; or &quot;look over or through in a casual or cursory manner&quot;.
* &quot;Ravel&quot; can mean &quot;to separate&quot; (e.g., threads in cloth) or &quot;to entangle&quot;.
* &quot;Sanction&quot; can mean &quot;approve&quot; or &quot;penalize&quot;.
* &quot;Table&quot; can mean &quot;to discuss a topic at a meeting&quot; (&quot;British English&quot;) or &quot;to postpone discussion of a topic&quot; (&quot;American English&quot;). Canadian English uses both meanings of the word.
=== Other languages ===

====Nouns====
* The Korean noun (&quot;ap&quot;) may mean either &quot;future&quot; or &quot;past&quot; (distinguished by context).

====Verbs====
* The German verb &quot;&quot;, the Dutch verb &quot;&quot;, the Afrikaans verb &quot;&quot;, the Polish verb , the Russian verb &quot;&quot; (&quot;odolžítʹ&quot;), the Finnish verb &quot;&quot;, and the Esperanto verb can mean either &quot;to lend&quot; or &quot;to borrow&quot;, with case, pronouns, and mention of persons making the sense clear. The verb stem conveys that &quot;a lending-and-borrowing event is occurring&quot;, and the other cues convey who is lending to whom. This makes sense because anytime lending is occurring, borrowing is simultaneously occurring; one cannot happen without the other.
* The German verb &quot;&quot; can mean either &quot;to drive around&quot; or &quot;to run over&quot;. The two variants are distinguished by stress, though. The Afrikaans verb &quot;omry&quot; can also mean either &quot;to drive around&quot; or &quot;to run over&quot;, but with no distinction in pronunciation.
* The Romanian verb &quot;a închiria&quot;, the French verb &quot;louer&quot;, the Afrikaans verb &quot;&quot;, the Finnish verb &quot;vuokrata&quot; and the Spanish and mean &quot;to rent&quot; (as the does) as well as &quot;to let&quot; (as the does). The English verb &quot;&quot; can also describe either the lessee&#x27;s or the lessor&#x27;s role.
* The Swahili verb &quot;kutoa&quot; means both &quot;to remove&quot; and &quot;to add&quot;. 
* The Chinese word &quot;打败&quot;, it means both &quot;be defeated&quot; and &quot;to defeat&quot;.
* The Persian verb چیدن (&quot;čidan&quot;) means both &quot;to pluck&quot; and &quot;to arrange&quot; (i.e. by putting objects down).
* In Spanish (basic meaning &quot;to give&quot;), when applied to lessons or subjects, can mean &quot;to teach&quot;, &quot;to take classes&quot; or &quot;to recite&quot;, depending on the context. Similarly with the French verb &quot;&quot;, which usually means &quot;to learn&quot; but may refer to the action of teaching someone. Dutch and Afrikaans &quot; can mean &quot;to teach&quot; or &quot;to learn&quot;.
* The Indonesian verbs &quot;menghiraukan&quot; and &quot;mengacuhkan&quot; can mean &quot;to regard&quot; or &quot;to ignore&quot;.
* The Indonesian/Malay adjective &quot;usah&quot; can mean &quot;required&quot; or &quot;discouraged&quot; (disambiguated by the use of &quot;tidak&quot; or &quot;tak&quot; &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;).

====Adverbs====
* and (&quot;kal&quot; ) may mean either &quot;yesterday&quot; or &quot;tomorrow&quot; (disambiguated by the verb in the sentence).
* can mean &quot;toward the sea&quot; or &quot;away from the sea&quot; depending on dialect.
* can mean &quot;a while ago&quot; or &quot;in a little bit/later on&quot;

====Agent nouns====
* The Italian, Spanish and French cognates (respectively) &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; can mean &quot;host&quot; or &quot;guest&quot;. The three words derive from the Latin &quot;hospes&quot;, which also carries both meanings.

====Adjectives====
*The Latin &quot;&quot; meant both &quot;auspicious&quot; and &quot;inauspicious&quot;, within the respective Roman and Greek traditions of augury. The negative meaning was carried on into French and ultimately English.
*Latin means &quot;excessive, too much&quot;. It maintained this meaning in Spanish , but it was also misinterpreted as &quot;insignificant, without importance&quot;.
*In Vietnamese, means among other things &quot;bright, clear&quot; (from Sino-Vietnamese ) and &quot;dead, gloomy&quot; (from ). Because of this, the name of the dwarf planet Pluto is not adapted from as in Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
*Spanish meant originally &quot;blissful, fortunate&quot; as in , &quot;fortunate land&quot;. However it developed an ironic and colloquial meaning &quot;bothersome, unlucky&quot;, as in , &quot;Damned flies!&quot;.

====In translation====
Seeming contronyms can arise from translation. In Hawaiian, for example, &quot;aloha&quot; is translated both as &quot;hello&quot; and as &quot;goodbye&quot;, but the essential meaning of the word is &quot;love&quot;, whether used as a greeting or farewell. Similarly, (&quot;annyeong&quot;) in Korean can mean both &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot; but the central meaning is &quot;peace&quot;. The Italian greeting &quot;&quot; is translated as &quot;hello&quot; or &quot;goodbye&quot; depending on the context; the original meaning was &quot;at your service&quot; (literally &quot;(I&#x27;m your) slave&quot;).

<doc id="555987" wikidata="Q223536" url="?curid=555987" title="Symphony No. 3 (Shostakovich)">
<text>The Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major (subtitled First of May), Op. 20 by Dmitri Shostakovich was first performed by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and Academy Capella Choir under Aleksandr Gauk on 21 January 1930 (the anniversary of Lenin&#x27;s death).

==Background==
Like the Second Symphony, the Third was written at a time when the freedom and modernism of the New Economic Policy (NEP) was giving way to the dominance of the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians. The Third more obviously reflects the latter&#x27;s demands for clear, simple expression of musical and political ideas, in its largely diatonic writing, its insistent rhythms, its remaining largely fixed in the &#x27;home&#x27; key of E-flat, its episodic nature, and in the use of a revolutionary text as a finale to deliver a clear, politically attuned message.

Unlike the Second, which was commissioned by the State Publishing House to honour the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, the Third was composed without a commission, with a text chosen by Shostakovich. In his report to the Leningrad Conservatory (1929), Shostakovich wrote “While in the [Second Symphony] the main content is struggle, the “May First” expresses the festive spirit of peaceful construction, if I may put it that way. To make the main idea clearer for the listeners, I introduced a chorus to words by the poet Kirsanov at the end.&quot;

==Reception==
Although, later in life, Shostakovich himself was unhappy with the Third, at the time of its premiere it was positively received. Boris Asafyev called it &quot;the birth of the symphony out of the dynamism of revolutionary oratory&quot;, and it was quickly performed in America by Leopold Stokowski, in Philadelphia in 1932 and at Carnegie Hall in early 1933. American critics were divided, with Lawrence Gilman calling it &quot;brainless and trivial music&quot;. As Soviet musical ideas changed and central control developed with the concept of Socialist Realism in the 1930s the Third was branded a symbol of &quot;formalism&quot; and dropped from the repertoire. It was not performed again until the 1960s.

==Structure==
The Symphony was written during the summer of 1929, much of it while on a six-week cruise along the Black Sea coast. Like the Second Symphony, it is a single-movement choral symphony which lasts around 25 to 30 minutes. Although the music is continuous, however, it falls into four unequal sections, the first two substantial and the last two, including the choral finale, much shorter:

* Allegretto - Allegro
* Andante
* Largo
* Moderato

The finale sets a text by Semyon Isaakovich Kirsanov praising May Day and the October Revolution. It is possible that, with its introductory recitative and brisk ending, Shostakovich was referencing the finale of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth, just as the Symphony&#x27;s consistent tonality of E-flat may recall Beethoven&#x27;s Eroica.

Around the time he was working on the symphony, Shostakovich said to a friend that “it would be interesting to write a symphony in which not one theme is repeated.” And in the Third he experimented with this idea. Like a May Day parade, sections pass by and do not return, and none of the themes is exactly repeated.

==Lyrics==
&lt;poem&gt;
On the very first May Day (&quot;the first first of May&quot;, in Russian)
a torch was thrown into the past,
a spark, growing into a fire, 
and a flame enveloped the forest.

With the drooping fir trees&#x27; ears
the forest listened 
to the voices and noises 
of the new May Day parade.

Our May Day.
In the whistling of grief&#x27;s bullets
grasping bayonet and gun, 
the tsar&#x27;s palace was taken.

The fallen tsar&#x27;s palace:
this was the dawn of May,
marching ahead,
in the light of grief&#x27;s banners.

Our May Day:
in the future there will be sails, 
unfurled over the sea of corn,
and the resounding steps of the corps.

New corps, the new ranks of May 
their eyes like fires looking to the future. 
factories and workers
march in the May Day parade.

We will reap the land,
our time has come.
Listen, workers, to the voice of our factories:
in burning down the old, you must kindle a new reality.

Banners rising like the sun,
march, let your steps resound. 
Every May Day 
is a step towards Socialism.

May Day is the march 
of armed miners.
Into the squares, revolution,
march with a million feet!
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for mixed chorus and an orchestra of 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, snare drum, cymbals, bass drum, tam-tam, glockenspiel, xylophone, and strings.

<doc id="555988" wikidata="Q978591" url="?curid=555988" title="Hot Hot Heat">
<text>Hot Hot Heat was a Canadian indie rock band from Victoria, British Columbia, formed in 1999. The band was signed to Seattle label Sub Pop in 2001 and Warner Records throughout the majority of their career.

The band has released five full-length albums to date, their first and critically acclaimed, &quot;Make Up the Breakdown&quot; (2002), &quot;Elevator&quot; (2005), &quot;Happiness Ltd.&quot; (2007), &quot;Future Breeds&quot; (2010) and their last before disbanding, &quot;Hot Hot Heat&quot; (2016). The band&#x27;s style makes use of electronic and traditional instruments and has variously been categorized as dance-punk, post-punk revival, and art-punk.

After five years of scant activity following the touring cycle of &quot;Future Breeds&quot; in 2011, on March 13, 2016, Hot Hot Heat announced new music with a limited edition 7&quot; record, &quot;Nature of Things&quot; which was released for April 16, 2016, in participation with Record Store Day that year. Preceding that release, on April 5, the group officially announced they had disbanded and would release their fifth and final self-titled album on June 24. 2016 via Kaw-Liga Records, with the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Kid Who Stays in the Picture&quot; premiering alongside the announcement.

Following an eight year hiatus, Hot Hot Heat reunited at the end of 2023, with the release of their comeback single, &quot;Shock Me&quot; on December 1, 2023. However, the reunion would be extremely short-lived following an announcement by the group on January 26, 2024, stating all intentions to release new material and subsequent live performances were effectively cancelled. The reasoning was further explained in part due to lead vocalist and primary songwriter Steve Bays no longer being able to commit to the group&#x27;s plans.

==Career==
Dustin Hawthorne, a drugstore clerk, and Steve Bays, a personal assistant, had been in many different bands together since 1995 and met Paul Hawley in 1998. In 1999, Hawley bought a Juno 6 keyboard and asked Bays to try playing it, as no one else knew how. Hawley took over the drums from Bays and Hawthorne played bass. Matthew Marnik, who was a friend of the band, sang vocals. The band&#x27;s original sound can be considered electropunk.

The band soon changed direction to a more melodic, pop-influenced style, losing Marnik and adding guitarist Dante DeCaro. Strongly influenced by the new wave sound of 1980s bands the Cure, XTC, the Clash, and Elvis Costello and the Attractions, the new lineup, with Steve on vocals, quickly released a series of 7&quot; singles and toured extensively in Canada and the American Pacific Northwest, joining up with similarly styled indie rock bands such as Les Savy Fav, the French Kicks, Radio 4, Ima Robot, and Pretty Girls Make Graves, and opening for established Canadian rockers Sloan on a national tour.

The band&#x27;s touring exposure attracted the interest of Seattle record label Sub Pop, who signed Hot Hot Heat in 2001, leading to the early 2002 release of EP &quot;Knock Knock Knock&quot;, produced in part by Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie. Although Hot Hot Heat got its start as a hardcore band, by the time it made contact with Sub Pop, its sound had mutated into what would soon be known as dance-punk. The band stood at the forefront of a movement that would explode on the indie rock scene within another year. That release was followed up quickly by the band&#x27;s first full-length release, &quot;Make Up the Breakdown&quot;, produced by Nirvana and Soundgarden producer Jack Endino.

That album quickly found critical acclaim, and its singles &quot;Bandages&quot; and &quot;Talk to Me, Dance With Me&quot; received regular airplay on MTV and radio, including influential Los Angeles, California station KROQ-FM, on whose charts both reached No. 1.

However, their track &quot;Bandages&quot; was removed from radio in the UK, from the playlist at BBC Radio 1, in the light of the war in the Middle East. This was thought to have hindered its position at No. 25 in the UK charts. The track had been on the B list on the station, guaranteeing 15 plays a week and a potential audience of millions. It was removed because of a &quot;prevalence of the word &#x27;bandages&#x27; in the song&quot;, a spokesperson said. In 2002, the band signed with Warner in the U.S.

In 2003, the band re-released the 2001 album of tracks recorded prior to their Sub Pop recordings, &quot;Scenes One Through Thirteen&quot;, on the OHEV Records label. Reflecting the band&#x27;s transition period between their original sound and the present, and thus very much unlike what fans had heard on &quot;Knock Knock Knock&quot; and &quot;Make Up the Breakdown&quot;.

In 2004, &quot;Make Up the Breakdown&quot; won &quot;Favourite Album&quot; at the Canadian Independent Music Awards by popular vote. Guitarist Dante DeCaro announced his departure from the band in October 2004, but stayed to complete their next album, and in 2005 joined Montreal band Wolf Parade. That album, &quot;Elevator&quot; was the band&#x27;s major label debut and was released commercially by Warner Bros. In April 2005, Dante handed guitar duties over to replacement Luke Paquin when the band started their 2005 tour. In June &quot;Elevator&quot; appeared in the top ten of the !earshot Campus and Community Radio chart.

In 2005, the band opened for Weezer and Foo Fighters on the &quot;Foozer Tour&quot;.

Hot Hot Heat played an opening set for American synth rock group the Killers at Red Rocks Amphitheatre on May 17, 2007. However, the Killers were forced to pull out after three songs because lead singer Brandon Flowers was suffering from bronchitis.

The group&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Elevator&quot; and third studio album, &quot;Happiness Ltd.&quot;, was released on September 11, 2007. In late March 2007, the band posted the song &quot;Give Up?&quot; on their Myspace page as a sample of the album, and it was released on iTunes as a single on May 15. A second single entitled &quot;Let Me In&quot; was released on July 16.

Hot Hot Heat toured in 2007 with Snow Patrol as their opening act on the U.S. leg of their summer tour. Their headlining tour of Germany, Canada and U.S. started September 3, 2007.

&quot;Let Me In&quot; debuted on KROQ-FM at number 8. On August 8, 2007, the music video for &quot;Let Me In&quot; premiered on Myspace Music. Also, on September 6, 2007, Hot Hot Heat posted their new album on their Myspace.

The band spent most of 2008/2009 recording and constructing their own studio. Experimenting with 5/4 disco grooves and electro loops, they went into the studio with producer/musician Ryan Dahle from Limblifter/Age of Electric awhile doing a brief Canadian tour opening for Bloc Party.

On September 24, 2008, Hot Hot Heat would make an appearance on second season of American-Canadian children&#x27;s television series, &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot;, with the song, &quot;Time to Go Outdoors&quot;, featured on season&#x27;s third episode, &quot;Talent&quot;. At some point during this period, founding bassist, Hawthorne quietly left the band. Parker Bossley from Canadian dance-punk band, Fake Shark - Real Zombie! would become the group&#x27;s new bassist. Ironically, another member of Fake Shark - Real Zombie!, Canadian guitarist, Louis Hearn would later on become the group&#x27;s next bassist following Bossley&#x27;s departure from the group in 2010.

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, Future Breeds was released June 8, 2010, through Dine Alone Records. To build anticipation for the release the band performed residencies at two small clubs in the United States, Public Assembly in New York City, and Bootleg Theater in Los Angeles throughout May and June 2010 respectively.

Hot Hot Heat&#x27;s public activity was scant in the 2010s; however, they debuted a new song, &quot;Mayor of the City&quot;, in May 2013. In response to a fan&#x27;s question on Twitter, Hot Hot Heat mentioned a release for an album in the fall of 2015. On September 10, 2015, Hot Hot Heat announced new material via their Instagram page for a spring 2016 release. On Friday June 24, 2016, Hot Hot Heat released a 10-track self-titled album and announced it would be their final album.

After the band split, Bays reunited with former bassist, Bossley to form, electro pop project, Fur Trade.

On November 18, 2023, the band announced they had reunited via social media, with Bays, Hawley, DeCaro and Bossley consisting as the line-up. Their return single, &quot;Shock Me&quot; was released Dec 1. 2023. On January 26, 2024, however, the band announced via social media that their reunion had come to an abrupt end just before the new year due to Bays feeling &quot;he could not participate.&quot;

<text>In organic chemistry, a tetrose is a monosaccharide with 4 carbon atoms. They have either an aldehyde () functional group in position 1 (aldotetroses) or a ketone () group in position 2 (ketotetroses).

The aldotetroses have two chiral centers (asymmetric carbon atoms) and so 4 different stereoisomers are possible. There are two naturally occurring stereoisomers, the enantiomers of erythrose and threose having the configuration but not the enantiomers. The ketotetroses have one chiral center and, therefore, two possible stereoisomers: erythrulose (- and -form). Again, only the enantiomer is naturally occurring.

== Biological Functions ==
There are a few known ways that tetrose sugars are used in nature. Some are seen in metabolic pathways and others are known to affect certain enzymes.

=== Intermediates in the Pentose Phosphate Pathway ===
One of the metabolic pathways that a tetrose is involved in is the Pentose Phosphate Pathway. In the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, there is an oxidative stage and a non-oxidative stage. A tetrose sugar, D-erythrose, is utilized in the non-oxidative stage, where D-ribulose 5-phosphate is generated into a 6 carbon sugar (fructose 6-phosphate) and a 3 carbon sugar (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate). Both of these molecules can be used elsewhere in the body.

D-erythrose 4-phosphate is generated as a product of a reaction called transaldolation. In the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, a transaldolase removes the first 3 carbon molecules of sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and places them onto a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The transaldolase utilizes a Schiff base to perform a reverse aldol reaction and a forward aldol reaction in its mechanism, generating an erythrose 4-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. The erythrose 4-phosphate is an important intermediate in the Pentose Phosphate Pathway because it is then used in the final non-oxidative step of the pathway.

The final non-oxidative step of the pathway is a transketolase reaction. A transketolase utilizes a thiamine pyrophosphate, or TPP cofactor, to break the unfavorable bond between the carbon in a carbonyl and the alpha carbon. TPP attacks a xylulose 5-phosphate molecule and facilitates the cleavage of the bond between the C2 (carbonyl carbon) and the C3 (alpha carbon), where glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is released. Then, C2 can attack erythrose 4-phosphate, which forms fructose 6-phosphate. Both of the products of this reaction can enter the gluconeogenesis pathway to regenerate glucose.

=== Inhibitors of Enzymes ===
A tetrose diphosphate molecule, D-threose 2,4-diphosphate, was discovered to be an inhibitor of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is the sixth enzyme used in the glycolysis pathway, and its function is to convert glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate into 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This tetrose diphosphate molecule inhibits the G3P dehydrogenase from performing catalysis because it oxidizes the enzyme by binding to it at the active site. When tetrose diphosphate is bound to the enzyme, the active site of the enzyme is blocked; therefore phosphorolysis of G3P is unable to occur. High concentrations of tetrose diphosphate must be used to outcompete the substrate, G3P, and block the function of G3P dehydrogenase. With the function of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase lost, glycolysis cannot proceed.

D-erythrose 4-phosphate was found to be an inhibitor of phosphoglucose isomerase. Phosphoglucose isomerase is the second enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, and its role is to convert glucose 6-phosphate into fructose 6-phosphate.

In both of these cases, the tetrose is an inhibitor of an enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, preventing it from proceeding onward.

<text>Ovens (), formerly also Athnowen, is a small village adjacent to the town of Ballincollig, County Cork, Ireland. The 2006 census recorded that the population of the village was 1,703 - an increase of 62.1% from the 2002 Census. Ovens is within the Cork North-West Dáil constituency.

Ovens is also a civil parish and the village is also the seat of a Roman Catholic parish of the same name.

== History ==
In Lewis&#x27; Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, published in 1837, Ovens is described under the Anglican parish name of Athnowen:

:&quot;ATHNOWEN (ST. MARY), or OVENS, a parish partly in the barony of BARRETTS, but chiefly in that of EAST MUSKERRY, county of CORK, and province of MUNSTER, 1½ mile (W.) from Ballincollig; containing 1953 inhabitants. This parish, which is generally called Ovens, is situated on the south line of road from Cork to Macroom, and is bounded on the north by the river Lee, and intersected by the Bride.

:&quot;It comprises 4660 statute acres, as applotted under the tithe act, and valued at £7594 per annum: the soil in the northern or hilly part is rather poor and stony, but in the vales extremely rich, lying on a sub-stratum of limestone forming part of the great limestone district extending to Castlemore on the west, and to Blackrock on the east. The limestone is quarried to some extent for burning into lime for the supply of the hilly districts to the north and south for a distance of several miles.&quot;

:&quot;The principal seats are Grange, the residents of J. Hawkes Esq., which occupies the site of Grange abbey (said to have been founded by St. Cera, who died in 679), and includes part of the ancient walls; Sirmount of G. Hawkes, Esq., which occupies an elevated site commanding and extensive prospect over a highly interesting and richly cultivated tract of the country; Spring Mount, of S. McCarthy Esq.; Clashenure, of Kyrle Allen, Esq.; and the glebe-house of the Rev. W. Harvey. There are two boulting-mills on the River Bride; one at Killumney belonging to Mr. D. Donovan, jun.; and the other at Ovens, belonging to Messrs. R. Donovan and Sons. The petty sessions for the District are held every alternative week at Carroghally. The living is a rectory and vicarage, in the diocese of Cork, united by diocesan authority, in 1785, to the prebend of Kilnaglory in the cathedral church of St. Finbarr, Cork: the tithes amount to £425.&quot;

:&quot;The church is a neat ancient structure with a square tower crowned with pinnacles. There is a glebe-house, with a glebe of 20a. 2r. 17p. In the Roman Catholic divisions this parish is the head of a union or district called Ovens, which included also the parishes of Desertmore and Aglish, and the ploughlands of Millane and Killumney, in the parish of St. Finbarr, Cork: the chapel, erected in 1835 is a handsome edifice of hewn limestone, in the mixed Gothic and Grecian styles of architecture. The male and female parochial schools are supported principally at the expense of the rector. There is also a national school, in which are 140 children, under the patronage of the Roman Catholic clergy, for which a spacious school-room has been built near the chapel. A dispensary has been established for the relief of the sick poor.&quot;

:&quot;Near the bridge of Ovens over the river Bride is the entrance of the celebrated limestone caves, which Smith, in his history of Cork, describes as 18 feet in height; but from the accumulation of rubbish they are now not more than three feet high and are nearly filled with water. They branch off into several ramifications, and from the roofs of some of them depend stalactites of various forms: their dimensions have never been satisfactorily ascertained. There some remains of the ancient castle called Castle Inchy.&quot;

== Amenities ==
Ovens remains a largely rural area, though urban Éire Óg is the local parish hurling and Gaelic football club. Agriculture remains the dominant local industry, though companies such as EMC Corporation and John A. Wood Ltd. provide employment to locals and those in the greater Cork area.

There is one primary school, Ovens National School, and the local Roman Catholic parish is the Ovens / Farran parish.

<text>is a village in Saihaku District, Tottori Prefecture, Japan. , it had an estimated population of 3,955 in 1277 households and a population density of 860 persons per km2. Its total area is .

==Geography==

*Yonago

==Demography==

==History==
Hiezu, unlike other areas of Tottori Prefecture, has no evidence of ancient settlements. The area was inhospitable to early settlement due to coastal flooding and its sandy soil. The area of present-day Hiezu appears in a Heian-period dictionary compiled in 934, the &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot;, as part of the village of Mino in Aimi District. Hiezu became part of the Kayashima shōen estate after this period, but all three areas of the village were destroyed by fire in 1571 in a regional conflict during the Sengoku period (1467 – 1573). By 1617 the village came under the control of the Ikeda clan, which controlled Hiezu as part of the Tottori Domain through the Edo period (1603 – 1868). The present-day village of Hiezu was formed by the merger of the villages on Hiezu, Tomiyoshi, and Imayoshi in 1889. The residents of Hiezu rejected a referendum on a merger with the city of Yonago in 2006. Hiezu, despite its small size, is the only village in Tottori Prefecture and remains an autonomous municipality.

==Government==
Heizu has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village council of 10 members. Heizu, collectively with the other municipalities of Saihaku District, contributes three members to the Tottori Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the village is part of Tottori 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

The pinnacle of the festival occurs when townspeople light the hill facing the park on fire, spelling out the festival&#x27;s name (十七夜) on the side of the hill.

<text>is a district located in Tottori Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2012, the district has an estimated population of 12,036 and a density of 20.1 persons per km2. The total area is .

==History==
Hino District has been settled since ancient times. The area is especially rich in remains from the late Kofun period (250 – 538) AD. Hino District belonged to Hōki Province, a former old province of Japan that covered the western part of present-day Tottori Prefecture. The district is described in the &quot;Izumo Fudoki&quot;, a detailed 8th-century record of the culture and geography of Izumo Province. The &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot;, a 10th-century Japanese dictionary, records that the district consisted of six villages by the time of the Heian period (794 – 1185). From the middle of the Kamakura period to the end of the Nanboku-chō period, from roughly the 13th to 14th centuries, the district was controlled by the Hino and Kamonamochi clans.

Various clans took control of the district in the Sengoku period (1467 – 1573), but the area was ultimately unified under the Ikeda clan, who ruled from Tottori Castle in present-day Tottori City. At the beginning of the Edo period (1603 – 1868) the district had 173 villages; by the end of the period, they numbered 165. Hino District was noted for the production of iron, steel, and tobacco in the Edo period. In 1858 Hino was separated into two districts, but records from the period indicate the borders of the area were, in general, poorly defined. Under the administrative reforms of the Meiji period (1868 – 1912) Hino District was re-established, and in 1889 consisted of 29 villages. Through various mergers the district now consists of only three municipalities.

==Geography==
Hino District stretches from roughly Mount Sentsū to the upper and middle reaches of the Hino River. The small plains in the valleys around the Hino River have been developed for rice production.

==Merger==

*On January 1, 2005 the town of Mizokuchi merged with the town of Kishimoto, from Saihaku District, to form the new town of Hōki, in Saihaku District.

<text>William Pugsley (September 27, 1850 – March 3, 1925) was a politician and lawyer in New Brunswick, Canada.

==Biography==
He was born in Sussex, New Brunswick, the son of William Pugsley, of United Empire Loyalist descent, and Frances Jane Hayward. He was educated at the University of New Brunswick. He studied mathematics, classics, and English earning numerous scholarships. In his junior year he was the gold medallist of his class. He went on to study law, was admitted to the bar in 1872 and set up practice in Saint John. The University of New Brunswick awarded him a BCL in 1879 and would confer honorary degrees of DCL in 1884 and LL.D in 1918. Pugsley was created a QC on 4 February 1891.

Pugsley, a Liberal, served as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick as well as Solicitor-General and Attorney-General before becoming the 11th premier of New Brunswick in 1907.

He resigned in September of that year to become Minister of Public Works in the federal Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier. He served in that position until the government&#x27;s defeat in the 1911 federal election, but remained as a Member of Parliament (MP) until 1917 when he was appointed the 15th lieutenant governor of New Brunswick. When his term ended in 1923, he was appointed to a federal position in charge of settling war claims, and held that position until his death. Pugsley was staying at King Edward Hotel when he fell ill and died of pneumonia in Toronto in 1925. He was buried in the Fernhill Cemetery in Saint John, New Brunswick.

<doc id="556034" wikidata="Q899272" url="?curid=556034" title="Choluteca Department">
<text>Choluteca is one of the 18 departments &quot;(departamentos)&quot; into which Honduras is divided. The departmental capital is the city of Choluteca. The Choluteca River runs through the department.

== History ==
In the Mesoamerican Classic period, the indigenous Cholutecas were engaged in trade in a vast territory encompassing the south of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, parts of El Salvador and Nicaragua. In the exercise of this industry they reached the South Coast of Honduras, and founded the settlement of what is now the city of Choluteca hundreds of years before the Spanish conquest.

Choluteca was created as a division of colonial rule from Guatemala in March 1535. Upon independence from Spain, the department of Choluteca was created on June 28, 1825, as one of the seven original departments in which Honduras was divided after independence during the government of the first head of state of Honduras, Dionisio de Herrera. Its borders were changed twice after the original partition. In 1843 the district of Guascorán was added to its territory, until then part of Comayagua. In 1893 its westernmost part was split, with the creation of the Valle department.

== Geography ==
Choluteca is the southernmost department of Honduras with an area of 4360 km2. In 2015 it had an estimated population of 447,852 inhabitants. Chuleteca has many lands that are used for agriculture, fishing, sugar production, and shrimp farms. The head of the department is the city of Choluteca, which is located on the Choluteca river that crosses the department. One crosses the Choluteca Bridge to enter the city.

Choluteca is bordered to the north by the departments of Francisco Morazán and El Paraíso, to the west by the Golfo de Fonseca and the department of Valle, and to the east and south by Nicaragua.

<text>Colón is one of the 18 departments into which Honduras is divided. It was created in 1881. The departmental capital is Trujillo, and the other main city is Tocoa. Trujillo was the site of the first Catholic mass on the American mainland, held when Christopher Columbus (Cristóbal Colón) reached the Honduran shore in 1502.

Colón harbors a substantial Garifuna population and has pristine beaches and rainforested national parks. The Fort of Santa Barbara, built by the Spaniards in the colonial era, was the site of the execution of US filibuster William Walker in Trujillo, and his remains are buried in the city&#x27;s graveyard.

The department covers a total surface area of 8,875 km2 and, in 2007, had an estimated population of 284,900 people.

<text>This is a list of [[stream]]s and [[river]]s of the [[U.S. state]] of [[New Jersey]].

The list of New Jersey rivers includes streams formally designated as rivers, as well as smaller streams such as branches, creeks, drains, forks, licks, runs, etc. found throughout the state. Among the major rivers in New Jersey are the Manasquan, Maurice, Mullica, Passaic, Rahway, Raritan, Musconetcong, Hudson and Delaware rivers. Throughout history, the Delaware and Raritan rivers have played a crucial role in transporting goods and people from the Atlantic Ocean into the inland areas, and they were once connected by the Delaware and Raritan Canal. Today, these rivers, along with the streams that feed them, provide sport and recreation for many people.

<text>is a town in Arida District, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 6,778 in 2833 households and a population density of 100 persons per km2. The total area of the town is . 

== Geography ==
Hirogawa is located on the coast in north-central Wakayama Prefecture, facing the Kii Channel. The Hirogawa River flows through the town. The climate is moderated by the influence of the Kuroshio Current offshore. 

===Neighboring municipalities===

*Aridagawa
*Hidaka
*Hidakagawa
*Yuasa
*Yura

==Climate==
Hirogawa has a Humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Hirogawa is 15.7 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1878 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.0 °C, and lowest in January, at around 5.8 °C. The area is subject to typhoons in summer. 

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hirogawa has remained fairly steady over the past century.

==History==
The area of the modern town of Hirogawa was within ancient Kii Province, and remains from the Jōmon period through the Kofun period indicate many centuries of settlement. During the Edo period, the hamlet of Hiro was a fishing port and farming settlement. The hamlet became famous during the 1854 Ansei-Nankai earthquake, when local headman Hamaguchi Goryō saved the lives of the villagers by setting fires to rice sheaves to guide villagers to a hilltop to save them from a tsunami. The story was popularized by &quot;Inamura no Hi: The Burning Rice Fields&quot; by Tsunezo Nakai (translated and published in English by Sara Cone Bryant) and Lafcadio Hearn&#x27;s &quot;Gleanings in Buddha-Fields&quot; (1897). Hamaguchi devoted himself to helping fellow villagers find jobs and built confidence by constructing a huge seawall. He also established a private academy called &quot;Taikyu-sha&quot; (current Taikyu Junior/High School) to give the villagers the opportunity to learn. (According to the school record, they are not teaching the way to be successful or be famous but to be practical in many ways, such as farming and ironing.) In 1907, George Trumbull Ladd, assisting Marquis Ito Hirobumi, visited the school and later published his journal &quot;Rare Days in Japan&quot; (1910).

The village of Hiro was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. It was raised to town status on October 1, 1950. On April 1, 1955, Hiro merged with the neighboring villages of Minamihiro and Tsugi, becoming the town of Hirogawa.

===In literature===
George Trumbull Ladd briefly described his visit in another book &quot;In Korea with Marquis Ito&quot; (1908) as follows:

We had taken a trip to the village of Hiro Mura, where formerly lived Hamaguchi Goryo, the benevolent patron of his village, whose act of self-sacrifice in burning his rice straw in order to guide the bewildered villagers to a place of safety when they were being overwhelmed by a tidal wave in the darkness of midnight, has been made the theme of one of Lafcadio Hearn’s interesting tales. Mr. Hearn, it appears, had never visited the locality; and, indeed, we were assured that we were the first foreigners who had ever been in the village streets. A former pupil of mine is at the head of a flourishing school patronized by the Hamaguchi family; and having accepted his invitation, in the name of the entire region, to visit them and speak to the school and to the teachers of the Prefecture, the cordial greeting, hospitable entertainment, and the surpassingly beautiful scenery, afforded a rich reward for the three or four days of time required. For, as to the scenery, not the drive around the Bay of Naples or along the Bosphorus excels in natural beauty the jinrikisha ride that surmounts the cliffs, or clings to their sides, above the bay of Shimidzu (“Clear Water”); while for a certain picturesque-ness of human interest it surpasses them both. On the way back to Wakayama – for Hiro Mura is more than twenty miles from the nearest railway station- three men to each jinrikisha, running with scarcely a pause and at a rate that would have gained credit for any horse as a fairly good roadster, brought us to the well-situated tea-house at Wakano-ura. For centuries the most celebrated of Japanese poets with the women gathering seaweed at low tide, the fishermen in the offing, the stocks standing on one leg in the water or flying above the rushed of the salt marsh. Here we were met for tiffin by the Governor of the Prefecture and the mayor of the city, and immediately after escorted to the city hall of Wakayama where an audience of some eight hundred, officials and teachers, had already assembled. While in the waiting-room of this hall, a telegram from Mr. Yokoi was handed to me, announcing that Marquis Ito had already left Oiso and would reach Kyoto that very evening and arrange to see me the next day.

==Government==
Hirogawa has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 10 members. Hirogawa collectively with the other municipalities of Arida District, contributes two members to the Wakayama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Wakayama 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

<text>was a town located on the middle courses of Arida River (有田川) in Arida District, of northwestern Wakayama Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 15,012 and a density of 412.76 persons per km2. The total area was 36.37 km2.

On January 1, 2006, Kibi, along with the towns of Kanaya and Shimizu (all from Arida District), was merged to create the town of Aridagawa.

It was surrounded by mountains, the highest being Komeyama. The town was known for Kishu mandarin oranges, known as きしゅう みかん in Japanese. Kibi-cho has a &quot;Fruit Tree Experiment Station&quot; of the &quot;Wakayama Research Center of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries&quot;. Kibi-cho City Hall and Kibi Dome were created by Kisho Kurokawa and constructed in 1993–1995.

A fossil tooth of the 20-foot-long Ginsu Shark Cretoxyrhina from 100 to 82 million years ago in the Cretaceous period has been found at Atagoyama, Kibi-Cho. Mid-Cretaceous Ammonites have been found in the stratigraphy of the Aridagawa (Arida River) valley near Kibi-cho.

Osamu Higashio, a former professional baseball player (1969-1988) and manager of the Saitama Seibu Lions from 1995 to 2001, was born in Kibi-cho.

<doc id="556064" wikidata="Q7512977" url="?curid=556064" title="Signing Exact English">
<text>Signing Exact English (&quot;SEE-II&quot;, sometimes Signed Exact English) is a system of manual communication that strives to be an exact representation of English language vocabulary and grammar. It is one of a number of such systems in use in English-speaking countries. It is related to Seeing Essential English (SEE-I), a manual sign system created in 1945, based on the morphemes of English words. SEE-II models much of its sign vocabulary from American Sign Language (ASL), but modifies the handshapes used in ASL in order to use the handshape of the first letter of the corresponding English word.

SEE-II is not considered a language itself like ASL; rather it is an invented system for a language—namely, for English.

==History==
Before 1970, deaf children had access to &quot;oral-only&quot; education, where teachers and other adults did not use sign in the classroom. Around the early 1970s, sign began to be used more as an educational tool in &quot;total communication&quot; classrooms. ASL had only recently been recognized as a language and forms of Manually Coded English had just been invented. Three main reasons served as grounds for the invention of Manually Coded English, Signing Exact English (SEE), in particular. At the time, there was dissatisfaction with the levels of educational achievement of deaf children, as difficulties with syntax and morphology were impacting their writing skills. In addition, a discrepancy between hearing and deaf children in regards to knowledge of normal language development was noted. Lastly, concerns rose in regards to speech reading and the ambiguities of relying solely on speech reading. With growing concern over the low levels of literacy and other academic skills attained by the majority of deaf students, manually coded sign systems began to develop. The first manual English System (SEE-I) was developed by David Anthony, a deaf teacher, with input from other deaf educators as well as parents of deaf children. This is known today as the Morphemic Sign Systems (MSS). This system was viewed as inadequate by other members of Anthony&#x27;s team and Gerilee Gustason, a deaf woman and deaf educator, along with other members of the original SEE-I team developed SEE-II. SEE-II was devised to give Deaf and hard of hearing children the same English communicative potential as their typically hearing peers. First published in 1972 by Gustasen, Pfetzing, and Zawolkow, SEE-II matches visual signs with the grammatical structure of English. Unlike ASL, which is a real language and has its own unique grammar system, SEE-II is intended to be an exact visual model of spoken English and allows children with hearing loss to access grammatically correct English, just as all hearing children receive in educational settings. SEE employs English word order, the addition of affixes and tenses, the creation of new signs not represented in ASL and the use of initials with base signs to distinguish between related English words. SEE-II is available in books and other materials. SEE-II includes roughly 4,000 signs, 70 of which are common word endings or markers. In comparison to Signed English, SEE-II involves more advanced motoric and cognitive functions.

==Handshapes==

Handshapes are one of the four components of a sign and convey a large amount of information about each sign. The two types of signs are static and dynamic. Dynamic signs involve hand movement and the handshape can remain the same or can change from one handshape to another. Usually only the handshapes at the start and end of a dynamic sign are important to understanding the meaning of each sign. There have been about 30-40 handshapes defined in SEE and they have many similarities to those of ASL.

=== SEE-II vs ASL Handshapes ===
ASL is a complete, unique language, meaning that it not only has its own vocabulary but its own grammar and syntax that differs from spoken English. SEE-II is not a true language but rather a system of gestural signs that rely on the signs from language of ASL to communicate in English through signs and fingerspelling. The vocabulary of SEE-II is a combination of ASL signs, modified ASL signs, or unique English signs. The reason SEE-II signs vary from ASL is to add clarity so that the exact English word meant for the conversation is understood. For example- the sign for &quot;car&quot; in ASL is two &quot;S&quot; hands gesturing as if they are holding onto and moving a steering wheel. This is the same sign used for any automobile controlled by a steering wheel. In SEE-II, &quot;car&quot; is signed by two C hands, one on top of the other, moving away from each other. To specify another vehicle, the hand shape is modified to include the first initial of the type of vehicle (e.g., V for &quot;van&quot;, B for &quot;bus&quot;, J for &quot;jeep&quot;, etc.). This is called an initialized sign- the meaning of the sign is clarified by initializing the sign with the first letter of the intended English word. This allows the signer to specify exactly what they want to communicate in English.

==Uses==
Because SEE-II is a manual version of spoken English, SEE-II and its variants may be easy for English speakers to learn. Currently, the average deaf or hard-of-hearing student graduating from high school reads at approximately the third- or fourth-grade level. SEE-II has been used in hopes of promoting reading skills in deaf students. Children who grew up on SEE-II are now in their 20s and 30s and members of the Deaf Community. A small survey of 46 former students of a school in the Northwest of America that uses SEE indicated that many graduated from high school and attended college. Many graduate from college and obtain jobs, live independently (78.8%), drive (93.3%), and vote (88.9%). About 15% of the participants in this study receive Supplemental Security Income. The advocacy group Hands &amp; Voices argues that SEE-II is easy for English speaking parents and teachers of deaf children to master because they do not have to learn a new grammar, and that it provides support for individuals who utilize cochlear implants, helping them match the SEE-II handshapes that they see with the hearing and speaking that they utilize.

==Research==
The use of Signing Exact English has been controversial but in 2012 was suggested by Dr. Marc Marschark (editor of &quot;Deaf Studies&quot; and &quot;Deaf Education&quot;) as a viable support to listening, speech, English language, and reading in the schools. Some deaf people find SEE to be difficult to efficiently perceive and produce. Deaf Community members born in the 1980s were most often raised on some form of signing and speaking and do so in their adult lives. Because unlike coded manual forms of English, such as SEE-II, ASL is a naturally-evolved language, it is vitally important for children who use SEE to have opportunities to learn ASL as well. However, it is advocated by some educators as a way of providing deaf children with access to a visual form of the English language. There is research published in the &quot;Journal of Deaf Studies in Deaf Education&quot; in 2013 to evidence that SEE serves as the home language for many families although it is technically a system of communication. It allows signers to drop word medial morphemes after they can be both spoken and signed by students. For example, the sign for &quot;examination&quot; is produced with two signs: EXAM + -TION. The system assumes that since &quot;examtion&quot; is not a word in English the observer will fill in the missing parts, and students demonstrate this through their intelligible speech daily in programs where SEE is used (Northwest School for Hearing-Impaired Children in the Seattle area). Thus, the SEE-II user must first be familiar with English in order to discern the correct form. Young children must be taught which signs have incomplete English morphemic representations just as occurs when children learn to read English writing systems, just are incomplete at time but serve a valuable purpose (as does SEE). Additionally, for use of figurative language, signs must literally translate from spoken English to Signed Exact English. To learn more about SEE and its effectiveness, read the most current research available in the two major journals in the field of Deaf Education.

Another argument against SEE-II is that it may not be the most efficient form of communication. ASL proponents argue that SEE-II takes the direct communications method used in the grammatical structure of American Sign Language (ASL) and fills it with English-based prepositions and articles that slow down communication and make it more difficult for the communicative partners to follow along. They believe that SEE-II may be a tool for teaching English but should be limited to classroom environments.

==Educational controversy==
In the United States, about two-thirds of teachers who have deaf or hard of hearing students instruct with some sort of sign language or manually coded system; this can include ASL, SEE-II, SEE-I, or Signed/Manual English, or a combination thereof. The debate is whether SEE-II benefits children enough to justify its teaching in place of ASL which is only used by 6% of children today. Proponents of SEE-II demonstrate through research that the system is useful in helping children learn to listen, speak, understand and use English as well as read and write English as do their same-age peers. They further claim that SEE-II can exist as a practical alternative to ASL without hindering the learning of ASL, because it is easier to learn for native verbal English speakers, such as individuals with partial hearing loss or no hearing impairment. Opponents point to the logistical disadvantages of trying to promote the mainstream use of a manually coded system, which is not a real language, and dispute that SEE-II offers advantages to warrant educational resources which could be put toward encouraging universal adoption of ASL.

<text>Bad Manners are an English two-tone and ska band led by frontman Buster Bloodvessel. Early appearances included &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and the live film documentary &quot;Dance Craze&quot; (1981).

They were at their most popular during the early 1980s, during a period when other ska revival bands such as Madness, the Specials and the Selecter filled the charts. Bad Manners spent 111 weeks in the UK Singles Chart between 1980 and 1983, and they also achieved chart success with their first four studio albums, with &quot;Ska &#x27;n&#x27; B&quot; (1980), &quot;Loonee Tunes!&quot; (1980), and &quot;Gosh It&#x27;s ... Bad Manners&quot; (1981) being their biggest hits.

==Formation==
Fronted by Buster Bloodvessel (real name Douglas Trendle), the band was formed in 1976, while most of the members were together at Woodberry Down Comprehensive School, near Manor House, North London. They commemorated the 1981 closure of the school on the back sleeve of their album, &quot;Gosh It&#x27;s ... Bad Manners&quot;, released that year.

==Career==
Early versions of the band date back to 1976 but Bad Manners were formed and played their first ever gig in January 1978. Dougie Trendle (Buster Bloodvessel), Alan Sayag (Winston Bazoomies), David Farren, Brian Tuitt, Paul Hyman (Gus &#x27;Hot Lips&#x27; Herman) and Louis Alphonso were all at school together. Martin Stewart, Chris Kane and Andrew Marson would join later.

After becoming popular in their native London, Bad Manners signed a recording contract with Magnet Records in 1980, and became regular guests on television shows such as &quot;Tiswas&quot;. The band also appeared on &quot;The British Music Awards&quot; (1981) and &quot;Cheggers Plays Pop&quot;. In 1985, they also appeared on &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;, hosted by Noel Edmonds. Being closely associated with the 2 Tone movement (though never signed to 2 Tone Records itself), they were one of six bands featured in the 1981 documentary film &quot;Dance Craze&quot;.

Some of their hit singles through the 1980&#x27;s include &quot;Nee Nee Na Na Na Na Nu Nu&quot;, &quot;My Girl Lollipop&quot;, &quot;Lip Up Fatty&quot;, &quot;Can Can&quot;, &quot;Special Brew&quot;, &quot;Walking in the Sunshine&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;ll Do Nicely&quot;. 

One of the main reasons for their notoriety was their outlandish huge-tongued and shaven-headed frontman, Buster Bloodvessel. His manic exploits got them banned from the British BBC TV chart show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, for painting his head red. The band was also banned from Italian TV after Bloodvessel mooned a concert audience on live television at the 1983 Sanremo Music Festival, after being told that the Pope was watching on TV.

Bad Manners had spent 111 weeks in the UK Singles Chart between 1980 and 1983, however, Bad Manners left Magnet Records in 1983, and joined Telstar Records releasing a compilation album, &quot;The Height of Bad Manners&quot;, which reached number 23 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was assisted with a television advertisement, and it brought the band back to the attention of the media and the British public – but no further chart hits.

The group then went on to sign a contract with Portrait Records in the United States and &quot;Mental Notes&quot; was released in 1985. For two years the band toured continuously all over the world but decided to disband in 1987.

==Break-up and reformation==

After Bad Manners disbanded for a brief spell after their deal with Portrait Records ended, Buster Bloodvessel formed a new outfit called Buster&#x27;s Allstars in 1987, which enabled him and a few of his friends to continue performing in and around London. The capital&#x27;s venues were often packed to capacity and this prompted the then 20 stone vocalist to reform Bad Manners with his fellow original members Louis Alphonso, Martin Stewart, Winston Bazoomies and Chris Kane. During 1988, the revamped Bad Manners band line-up started to play a number of shows at universities and at scooter rallies and they licensed the name and logo of Blue Beat Records, setting up office inside a barge called the Blood Vessel in the back garden of Buster Bloodvessel&#x27;s former home in London. 

After Blue Beat became defunct in 1990, Bad Manners were without a recording contract, but continued to tour. In 1992, they signed a deal with Pork Pie Records and &quot;Fat Sound&quot; was released in Europe. The album was originally intended to be released in the UK on Blue Beat.

In 1996, Buster Bloodvessel moved to Margate and opened a hotel on the seafront called Fatty Towers, which catered for people with huge appetites. While living in Margate, he was a regular spectator at Margate F.C., and Bad Manners sponsored the club for one season. Fatty Towers closed in 1998 and did not re-open despite a facelift. After its closure, Buster Bloodvessel moved back to London.

After five years without releasing any new material, Bad Manners issued their &quot;Heavy Petting&quot; album in 1997. Six years later, Buster set up another record label and the band released &quot;Stupidity&quot; on Bad Records in 2003.

In 2004, Bad Manners appeared on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in the Christmas Special, performing festive songs to the contestants which included Phill Jupitus and Noddy Holder (Jupitus is a fan of the band, and Buster Bloodvessel had appeared as a panellist on the show earlier that year).

Buster Bloodvessel is the only original member to remain in Bad Manners, but the harmonica player, Winston Bazoomies, was an &#x27;honorary member&#x27; of the band. Bazoomies had a Facebook fanpage set up in his honour and lived in North London.

Martin Stewart left Bad Manners in 1991, and performed and recorded with the Selecter for fifteen years. He now lives in Middlesex with his family, and most recently played the keyboards in a band called the Skatalysts. Louis Alphonso lives in Paris and released his &quot;A Noir&quot; solo studio album on the French Fries record label in 2015, while his fellow musician, David Farren, left in 1987 after the band&#x27;s contract with Portrait Records ended. Farren designed the original band logo, and painted the front cover of the album &quot;Gosh It&#x27;s ... Bad Manners&quot; (1981). Chris Kane is a session musician. He became a music teacher during the 1990s and also performed with the Jordanaires after leaving Bad Manners. Brian Tuitt also left the band in 1987 and lives in Kent. The drummer has been performing with Ben Russell &amp; the Charmers in recent times while also working with the Barry White Unlimited Love Tour at various venues in the UK, while Andrew Marson, who also left the group the same year, has worked as a carpenter and also performs in a country and western outfit called the Drawbacks. Paul Hyman, another original member who left the band in the late 1980s, lives in Enfield and works in the London Stock Exchange, an occupation he has had since leaving Bad Manners.

Bad Manners headlined their own annual music festival known as Bad Fest in 2005 and 2006 at RAF Twinwood Farm. This festival featured ska, mod-related and punk rock bands from the 1980s to the present.

In 2011, Cherry Red Records released the band&#x27;s first four studio albums, &quot;Ska &#x27;n&#x27; B&quot; (1980), &quot;Loonee Tunes!&quot; (1980), &quot;Gosh It&#x27;s ... Bad Manners&quot; (1981) and &quot;Forging Ahead&quot; (1982) on CD for the first time with added bonus tracks. The albums were issued on their sister label, Pressure Drop.

In December 2012, the band released their first single in thirteen years. &quot;What Simon Says&quot; was released via download just before the festive season, and the music video featured Bad Manners fans from across the world but none of the band members themselves. The song hints at the power Simon Cowell has within the UK music industry.

In December 2012, founding members of the band met for the first time in decades at the Ship public house in Soho, London. Paul Hyman, Martin Stewart, Brian Tuitt and Chris Kane met with band historian and harmonica player David Turner, and Christopher &#x27;Dell&#x27; Wardell, a music writer and promoter from Darlington. On 18 July 2013, seven of the original nine members reunited at The Brownswood public house, near Finsbury Park, that is within striking distance of their old school, Woodbery Down Comprehensive. The &#x27;Bad Manners Originals&#x27; who attended the reunion were Andy Marson (alto sax), Paul Hyman (trumpet), Winston Bazoomies (Alan Sayag) (harmonicas), Chris Kane (tenor sax), David Farren (bass), Martin Stewart (keyboards) and Brian Tuitt (drums). The meetings were arranged after Wardell&#x27;s &#x27;Where Are They Now?&#x27; article was published in &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; in 2012, providing details on the current whereabouts of all of the original band members.

During 2016, Bad Manners toured the United Kingdom to celebrate their 40th Anniversary.

Original member Winston Bazoomies died on 1 December 2022, at the age of 63.

The band are still touring the United Kingdom in 2024.

<doc id="556077" wikidata="Q365456" url="?curid=556077" title="Dennis Rader">
<text>Dennis Lynn Rader (born March 9, 1945), also known as BTK (an abbreviation he gave himself for &quot;bind, torture, kill&quot;), is an American serial killer who murdered at least 10 people in Wichita and Park City, Kansas, between 1974 and 1991. Although he occasionally killed or attempted to kill men and children, Rader typically targeted women. His victims were often bound, sometimes with objects from their homes, and either suffocated with a plastic bag or manually strangled with a ligature. In addition, he stole keepsakes from his female victims, including underwear, driver&#x27;s licenses, and personal items. 

Rader often sent taunting letters to police and media outlets, describing his crimes in detail. In 2004, after a thirteen-year hiatus, Rader resumed sending letters, leading to his 2005 arrest and subsequent guilty plea. He is currently serving ten consecutive life sentences at the El Dorado Correctional Facility.

==Life and background==
Dennis Lynn Rader was born in Pittsburg, Kansas, on March 9, 1945. His parents were bookkeeper Dorothea Mae Rader (; September 17, 1925 – October 14, 2007) and Kansas Gas Service worker William Elvin Rader (November 21, 1922 – December 27, 1996). He was the eldest of four sons. Growing up in Wichita, Rader later recalled feeling ignored by his mother. Both of his parents worked long hours and paid little attention to their children at home.

From a young age, Rader harbored sadistic sexual fantasies about torturing &quot;trapped and helpless&quot; women. He also exhibited zoosadism by torturing, killing and hanging small animals. Rader acted out sexual fetishes for voyeurism, autoerotic asphyxiation and cross-dressing, often spying on female neighbors while dressed in women&#x27;s clothing, including women&#x27;s underwear that he had stolen. He also masturbated with ropes or other bindings around his arms and neck.

Years later, during his &quot;cooling off&quot; periods between murders, Rader would take pictures of himself wearing women&#x27;s clothes and a female mask while bound. He later admitted that he was pretending to be his victims as part of his sexual fantasy. However, Rader kept his proclivities well hidden, and was widely regarded in his community as &quot;normal, polite, and well mannered.&quot;

After graduating from Wichita Heights High School, Rader attended Kansas Wesleyan University. He received only mediocre grades and dropped out after one year. Rader served in the United States Air Force from 1966 to 1970. On discharge, he moved to Park City, a suburb of Wichita, where he worked in the meat department of an IGA supermarket where his mother was employed as a bookkeeper.

Rader married Paula Dietz on May 22, 1971. They had two children, Kerri and Brian. He attended Butler County Community College in El Dorado, earning an associate degree in electronics engineering in 1973. He then enrolled at Wichita State University and graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in administration of justice.

Rader initially worked as an assembler for the Coleman Company, an outdoor supply company. He then worked at the local Wichita office of ADT Security Services from 1974 to 1988, where he installed security alarms. Ironically, many of his clients were concerned homeowners seeking security from his own killings as BTK. Rader was a field operations supervisor for the Wichita area for the 1990 federal census.

In May 1991, Rader became a dogcatcher and compliance officer in Park City. In this position, neighbors recalled him as being sometimes overzealous and extremely strict, as well as taking special pleasure in bullying and harassing single women. Two women he stalked in the 1980s, and one whom he stalked in the mid-1990s, filed restraining orders against him; one of these women also changed her address to avoid him. One neighbor complained that Rader killed her dog for no reason. Rader was a member of Christ Lutheran Church in Wichita, and at one point was elected president of the church council. He was also a Cub Scout leader and would frequently use being with the scouts as his alibi when a BTK killing was discovered.

By the 2000s, the public&#x27;s memories of the murders had begun to fade. Local author Robert Beattie began writing a book about the killings, &quot;Nightmare in Wichita&quot;, after being shocked that many young people he spoke to had never heard of the BTK case. Hungry for attention, Rader re-emerged as BTK in 2004 after learning that the book was being written.

On July 26, 2005, after Rader&#x27;s arrest, his wife was granted an emergency divorce, waiving the normal sixty-day waiting period.&lt;ref name=&quot;kansas/1003760&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;divorcenet/kansas&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ABC News in 2019, his daughter Kerri stated she writes to her father and has now forgiven him, but still struggles to reconcile her &quot;normal&quot; childhood with the knowledge that she was raised by the BTK killer. However, at the 2024 Crime Con in Nashville, Tennessee, Kerri revealed excerpts from her father&#x27;s journal that revealed he had sexually abused her as a young girl.

== Case history ==
=== Confirmed murders ===
Otero Murders

On January 15, 1974, four members of the Otero family were murdered in Wichita. The victims were Joseph Otero Sr. (38), Julia Maria &quot;Julie&quot; Otero (33), Joseph &quot;Joey&quot; Otero II (9) and Josephine &quot;Josie&quot; Otero (11). Their bodies were discovered by the family&#x27;s three older children, who had been at school at the time of the killings. After his 2005 arrest, Rader confessed to the Otero murders. He claimed that he first targeted the family two months prior, when he spotted Julie leaving to take her children to school and followed them. On the morning of January 15, Rader cut the phone lines and entered the Otero residence when Joey opened the back door for the family dog.

Rader told the Otero family that he was a &quot;wanted&quot; man in California before he ordered them to lie on the living room floor at gunpoint. Then, he led the family into a bedroom and bound them with rope he had prepared. Joseph and Joey were on the floor, while Julie and Josie were on the bed. The wrists and feet of Joseph and Julie were restrained. Joseph&#x27;s head was covered by a plastic bag, which Rader then secured with ropes. After Joseph chewed a hole in the bag, another bag was tightened over his head, causing him to slowly suffocate to death.

Rader attempted to strangle Julie, later recalling: &quot;Mrs. Otero woke back up. She was pretty upset with what was going on, and she asked me to save her son, so I took the bag off. She screamed, &#x27;You killed my boy! You killed my boy!&#x27; After the initial realization and shock, she communicated, &#x27;God have mercy on your soul,&#x27; before I put her down, permanently.&quot; Rader strangled Julie to death with rope. With both parents dead, Rader then placed another plastic bag, followed by two T-shirts and an additional bag, over Joey&#x27;s head, watching as he thrashed and suffocated. Afterward, Rader led Josie down into the basement, where he hanged her with a noose from a pipe. Later, police found Rader&#x27;s semen near Josie&#x27;s partially clothed body. Rader eventually wrote a letter that he stashed inside an engineering book in the Wichita Public Library in October 1974, describing the Otero killings in detail.

Murder of Kathryn Bright

On April 4, 1974, Rader broke into the Wichita home of Kathryn Doreen Bright (21) through her screen door but was taken aback to discover her 19-year-old brother, Kevin Bright, was also present in the property. He transported Kathryn to another bedroom and tied her down after forcing Kevin, who was being held at gunpoint, to restrain his sister with a rope Rader had provided. Rader attempted to strangle Kathryn before stabbing her three times in the back and lower abdomen with a knife when she struggled too much. Kevin was also strangled and shot in the head, but he survived by feigning death and later escaping.

Murder of Shirley Ruth Relford

On March 17, 1977, Shirley Ruth Relford (25) was found dead in her home in Wichita. Rader was pursuing Relford and located her by following her 5-year-old son to her home. Rader entered their residence and produced a handgun from his jacket, frightening the family. After tying up her three children and locking them in the bathroom, Rader took Relford to the rear bedroom. Relford vomited before being tied to her bedpost by her legs. Rader strangled her with rope after placing a plastic bag over her head, while her children screamed and banged down the hallway. Similar to the Otero murders, Rader intended to murder Relford&#x27;s children, although they were ultimately able to escape before he could do so.

Murder of Nancy Jo Fox

When Rader noticed Nancy Jo Fox (25) going into her home in Wichita, he marked her as a potential victim and began stalking her. On December 8, 1977, Rader knocked at her door. When nobody answered, he cut the phone lines before breaking in to wait for Fox in her kitchen. Her murder would be described by Rader as &quot;what I call a perfect – perfect hit. Although she gave me a lot of verbal static, she cooperated, and she didn&#x27;t fight me. I had complete control of her, that&#x27;s why it was one of the more enjoyable kills, as I call them.&quot; Rader killed Fox by strangling her with his belt on her bed. Before she died, Rader told her that he was responsible for the Otero murders. The following day, Rader called police from a payphone, telling them they would find Fox&#x27;s body at her home.

BTK asks for infamy
On February 10, 1978, Rader sent another letter to Wichita television station KAKE claiming responsibility for the murders. He suggested many possible names for himself, including &quot;BTK.&quot; He demanded media attention in this second letter, saying, &quot;How many do I have to kill, before I get a name in the paper or some national attention?&quot; A poem was enclosed titled &quot;Oh! Death to Nancy,&quot; a parody of the lyrics to the American folk song &quot;O Death&quot;. In the letter, Rader claimed to be driven to kill by &quot;factor X,&quot; which he characterized as a supernatural element that also motivated Jack the Ripper, the Son of Sam and the Hillside Stranglers. He also asked for the police to send him a hidden message. In response, and with the knowledge that the BTK killer watched KAKE, police decided to flash a subliminal message during one of the station&#x27;s evening newscasts for a split second. The message stated: &quot;Now call the chief,&quot; and featured a drawing of an upside-down pair of glasses, which were found at the Fox crime scene. They hoped the message would influence the killer to turn himself in, but it was unsuccessful. 

Attempted murder of Anna Williams

During this time, Rader also intended to kill others, such as Anna Williams (63), who, in 1979, escaped death by returning home much later than expected. Rader explained during his confession that he became obsessed with Williams and was &quot;absolutely livid&quot; when she evaded him. He recalled spending hours waiting at Williams&#x27; home but becoming impatient and leaving when she did not return from visiting friends.

Murder of Marine Hedge

Marine Hedge (53) was found on May 5, 1985, at East 53rd Street North in Wichita, between North Webb Road and North Greenwich Road. Rader had killed her on April 27 and took her body to Christ Lutheran Church, where he was the president of the church council. There, he photographed her body in various suggestive positions. Rader had previously stored black plastic sheets and other materials at the church in preparation for the murder and then, later, dumped the body in a remote ditch.

Murder of Vicki Wegerle

On September 16, 1986, Rader strangled Vicki Lynn Wegerle (28) to death with a nylon stocking at her house in Wichita. He entered the residence by pretending to be a telephone repairman. After the murder, he rearranged her clothes and took a number of photographs of her nude body. 

Murder of Dolores Davis

His final victim, Dolores Earline &quot;Dee&quot; Davis (62), was found dead on February 1, 1991, at West 117th Street North and North Meridian Street in Park City. Rader had killed her on January 19 by strangling her with pantyhose.

===Suspected murders===
On August 23, 2023, the Associated Press reported that Rader was considered the prime suspect in two further killings in Oklahoma and Missouri. Authorities discovered &quot;possible trophies&quot; from victims after launching a search for evidence at Rader&#x27;s former Park City home, resulting in the investigation of his potential involvement in additional unsolved disappearances and murders:

* Cynthia Dawn Kinney (16) was last seen in Osage, Oklahoma, on June 23, 1976, at Osage Laundromat. Witnesses said she left the laundromat at 9:30 a.m. and got into a faded beige 1965 Plymouth Belvedere. In 2023, Osage Sheriff Eddie Virden claimed that Rader had been identified as a prime suspect after it was determined that he was involved in Boy Scout events in the area and when it was learned that Rader had included the phrase &quot;bad wash day&quot; in his writings. A bank was also having new ADT alarms installed across the street from the laundromat, when Kinney went missing; Rader was a regional installer for ADT at the time. Furthermore, Rader has allegedly claimed to have &quot;fantasized about kidnapping a girl from a laundromat.&quot; Rader has denied involvement in the murder, which Virden believes is due to possibly being tried in Oklahoma and potentially being given the death penalty.

=== Cold case ===
By 2004, the investigation of the BTK killer was considered a cold case. However, Rader initiated a series of 11 communications to local media, which led directly to his arrest in February 2005. In March 2004, &quot;The Wichita Eagle&quot; received a letter from someone using the name &quot;Bill Thomas Killman&quot; claiming that he had murdered Vicki Wegerle in 1986. Enclosed with the message were photographs of the crime scene and a photocopy of Wegerle&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license, which had been stolen at the time of the crime. Prior to this message, it had not been definitively established that Wegerle was killed by BTK. DNA collected from under her fingernails provided police with previously unknown evidence. They began DNA testing hundreds of men in an effort to find the killer. Altogether, more than 1,300 DNA samples were taken and later destroyed by court order.

In May 2004, KAKE received a letter with chapter headings for the &quot;BTK Story&quot;, fake IDs and a word puzzle. On June 9, a package was found taped to a stop sign at the corner of First and Kansas roads in Wichita, which contained graphic descriptions of the Otero murders and a sketch labeled &quot;The Sexual Thrill Is My Bill.&quot; Also enclosed was a chapter list for a proposed book titled &quot;The BTK Story&quot;, which mimicked a story written in 1999 by Court TV crime writer David Lohr. Chapter One was titled &quot;A Serial Killer Is Born.&quot; In July, a package dropped into the return slot at a public library contained more bizarre material, including the claim that BTK was responsible for the death of 19-year-old Jake Allen in Argonia, Kansas, earlier that month. This claim was false, and that death was ruled a suicide.

After his capture, Rader admitted in his interrogation that he had been planning to kill again, that he had set a date (October 2004) and was stalking his intended victim. That month, a manila envelope was dropped into a UPS box in Wichita. It contained many cards with images of terror and bondage of children pasted on them, a poem threatening the life of lead investigator Lieutenant Ken Landwehr and a false autobiography with many details about Rader&#x27;s life. These details were later released to the public. In December 2004, Wichita police received another package from the killer. This time, the package was found in Wichita&#x27;s Murdock Park. It contained the driver&#x27;s license of Nancy Fox, which was noted as stolen from the crime scene, as well as a doll that was symbolically bound at the hands and feet with a plastic bag tied over its head.

In January 2005, Rader attempted to leave a cereal box in the bed of a pickup truck at a Home Depot in Wichita, but the box was discarded by the truck&#x27;s owner. It was later retrieved from the trash after Rader asked what had become of it in a later message. Surveillance tape of the parking lot from that date revealed a distant figure driving a black Jeep Cherokee leaving the box in the pickup. In February 2005, more postcards were sent to KAKE, and another cereal box left at a rural location was found to contain another bound doll.

In his letters to police, Rader asked if his writings, if put on a floppy disk, could be traced or not. The police answered his question in a newspaper ad posted in the &quot;Eagle&quot;, saying it would be safe to use the disk. On February 16, 2005, Rader sent a purple 1.44-megabyte Memorex floppy disk to Wichita station KSAS-TV. Also enclosed were a letter, a gold-colored necklace with a large medallion and a photocopy of the cover of &quot;Rules of Prey&quot;, a 1989 novel by John Sandford about a serial killer. Police found metadata embedded in a deleted Microsoft Word document that was, unknown to Rader, still stored on the floppy disk. The metadata contained the words &quot;Christ Lutheran Church&quot; and the document was marked as last modified by &quot;Dennis.&quot; An Internet search determined that a &quot;Dennis Rader&quot; was president of the church council. When investigators drove by Rader&#x27;s house, a black Jeep Cherokee—the type of vehicle seen in the Home Depot surveillance footage—was parked outside.
This was strong circumstantial evidence against Rader, but they needed more direct evidence to detain him.

Police obtained a warrant to test a pap smear taken from Rader&#x27;s daughter at the Kansas State University medical clinic. DNA tests showed a &quot;familial match&quot; between the pap smear and the sample from Wegerle&#x27;s fingernails; this indicated that the killer was closely related to Rader&#x27;s daughter and, combined with the other evidence, was enough for police to arrest Rader.

=== Arrest ===
Rader was arrested while driving near his home in Park City shortly after noon on February 25, 2005. An officer asked, &quot;Mr. Rader, do you know why you&#x27;re going downtown?&quot; Rader replied, &quot;Oh, I have suspicions why.&quot; Officers from the Wichita Police, Kansas Bureau of Investigation, and FBI and ATF searched Rader&#x27;s home and vehicle, seizing evidence including computer equipment, a pair of black pantyhose retrieved from a shed and a cylindrical container. Christ Lutheran Church, Rader&#x27;s office and the main branch of the Park City library were also searched. At a press conference the next morning, Wichita Police Chief Norman Williams announced, &quot;The bottom line: BTK is arrested.&quot;

== Legal proceedings ==
On February 28, 2005, Rader was charged with 10 counts of first degree murder. Soon afterward, the Associated Press cited an anonymous source alleging that Rader had confessed to other murders in addition to those with which he had been connected. However, the Sedgwick County district attorney denied the story, yet refused to say whether Rader had made any confessions or if investigators were looking into his possible involvement in more unsolved killings. On March 5, news sources claimed to have verified by multiple sources that Rader had confessed to the 10 murders he was charged with, but no other ones.

On March 1, Rader&#x27;s bail was set at US$10 million, and a public defender was appointed to represent him. On May 3, the judge entered not guilty pleas on Rader&#x27;s behalf, as Rader did not speak at his arraignment; however, on June 27, the scheduled trial date, Rader changed his plea to guilty. He described the murders in detail to the court and made no apologies.

At Rader&#x27;s August 18 sentencing, victims&#x27; families made statements, after which Rader apologized in a rambling 30-minute monologue that the prosecutor likened to an Academy Awards acceptance speech. His statement has been described as an example of an often-observed phenomenon among psychopaths: their inability to understand the emotional content of language. Rader was sentenced to 10 consecutive life sentences, with a minimum of 175 years. Kansas did not enforce the death penalty at the time of the murders. On August 19, Rader was moved to the El Dorado Correctional Facility.

Rader talked about innocuous topics such as the weather during the forty-minute drive to El Dorado but began to cry when the victims&#x27; families&#x27; statements from the court proceedings came on the radio. He is now in solitary confinement for his protection (with one hour of exercise per day and showers three times per week). This will likely continue until his death. Beginning in 2006, Rader was allowed access to television and radio, to read magazines and other privileges for good behavior.

=== Further investigations ===
Following Rader&#x27;s arrest, police in Wichita and several surrounding cities looked into unsolved cases with the cooperation of the state police and the FBI. They particularly focused on cases after 1994, when the death penalty was reinstated in Kansas. Police in surrounding states also investigated cold cases that fit Rader&#x27;s pattern. After exhaustive investigations, none of these agencies discovered any further murders attributable to Rader, supporting early suspicions that he would have taken responsibility for any additional murders that he had committed. As a result, the ten known murders were at that point believed to be the only murders for which Rader was actually responsible, although Wichita police are fairly certain that he stalked and researched a number of other potential victims. This includes one person who was saved when Rader called off his planned attack upon his arrival near the target&#x27;s home due to the presence of construction and road crews nearby. Rader stated in his police interview that &quot;there are a lot of lucky people&quot;, meaning that he had thought about and developed various levels of murder plans for other victims.

=== Psychological evaluation ===
Massachusetts psychologist Robert Mendoza was hired by Rader&#x27;s public defenders to conduct a psychological evaluation and determine if an insanity-based defense might be viable. He conducted an interview after Rader had pleaded guilty on June 27, 2005. Mendoza diagnosed Rader with narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive and antisocial personality disorders: he observed that Rader has a grandiose sense of self, a belief that he is &quot;special&quot; and therefore entitled to special treatment; a pathological need for attention and admiration; a preoccupation with maintaining rigid order and structure; and a complete lack of empathy.

The videotape of Mendoza&#x27;s interview ended up being used on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dateline&quot;. NBC claimed Rader knew the interview might be televised, but this was false according to the Sedgwick County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. Rader mentioned the interview during his sentencing statement. On October 25, 2005, the Kansas attorney general filed a petition to sue Mendoza and Tali Waters, co-owners of Cambridge Forensic Consultants LLC, for breach of contract, claiming that they intended to benefit financially from the use of information obtained through involvement in Rader&#x27;s defense. On May 10, 2007, Mendoza settled the case for US$30,000 with no admission of wrongdoing.

* A character based on Rader played by actor Sonny Valicenti appears in the Netflix series &quot;Mindhunter&quot;.
* Writer-director Ulli Lommel depicted Rader&#x27;s murder spree and subsequent capture in the highly fictionalized &quot;B.T.K. Killer&quot; (2005).
* Kane Hodder portrays Rader in the 2008 movie &quot;B.T.K.&quot;, a half biopic and half fictionalized account of the murders.
* The antagonist from the movie &quot;The Clovehitch Killer&quot; was inspired by Dennis Rader.
* Thrash metal band Exodus wrote a song entitled &quot;BTK&quot; for their album &quot;Blood In, Blood Out&quot;, which was inspired by Rader&#x27;s crimes.
* The song &quot;Raider II&quot; from Steven Wilson&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Grace for Drowning&quot; is written primarily about Rader&#x27;s murders.

<text>was a village located in Hidaka District, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the village had an estimated population of 2,107 and a density of 12.50 persons per km2. The total area was 168.62 km2.

On May 1, 2005, Miyama, along with the town of Kawabe, and the village of Nakatsu (all from Hidaka District), was merged to create the town of Hidakagawa.

Despite this merger, many local people still identify with the village name, continue their local traditions, and teach village history in the school system. There are three distinct hamlets in Miyama village pocketed along the Hidaka River. These include Kawaharagou, Kasamatsu, and Sougawa; each hamlet has an elementary school, with Kawaharagou home to the village&#x27;s only Junior High School. Miyama is home to many small, locally run shops, a large dam, and a park called &quot;Yahoo point,&quot; famous for its mountain echo; tourists and families shout from the mountain and over the river to produce the echo.

On November 3, the Sougawa Matsuri is held at Sougawa Shrine, which was built by the Sougawa Chogen in 1204. It is an ancient festival where the Maishishi of Shingaku, or lion dance, takes place.

== Geography ==
Minabe is located at the southernmost edge of Hidaka District in central Wakayama Prefecture. The main part of Minabe, including the train station, government buildings, and business district, lies around the basin of the Minabe River as it flows into Minabe Bay on the Pacific Ocean. There are three distinguishing features of Minabe Bay: Kashima Island situated approximately 1 km offshore, a long non-swimming beach that runs parallel to the central business district, and two prominent rocky points at either end. The central area of town is largely flat and comprises the majority of houses and people. It is moderately populated, with many cultivated fields and buildings.

To the west-northwest of central Minabe is the Iwashiro region which is centered on the Iwashiro River Basin. This area is lightly populated and a mixture of farmland and forested mountains. To the northeast is the Kamiminabe region. This area is partly mountainous. Following the river farther upwards, the valley becomes increasingly narrow and forested, with little ground suitable for cultivation or houses. The path of the Minabe River here is narrow, no more than 30 meters across. Approximately eight kilometers from the center of town is the lightly populated region of Takagi which features some farmland and houses. A further six kilometers up the river valley is the even smaller region of Kiyokawa, which is the end of Minabe. The highest point is located here: 768 meters above sea level.

<text>Cortés is one of the 18 departments of Honduras. The department covers an area of 3,954 km2 and, in 2015, had an estimated population of 1,612,762, making it the most populous in Honduras. The Merendón Mountains rise in western Cortés, but the department is mostly a tropical lowland, the Sula Valley, crossed by the Ulúa and Chamelecon rivers.

It was created in 1893 from parts of the departments of Santa Bárbara and Yoro. The departmental capital is San Pedro Sula. Main cities also include Choloma, La Lima, Villanueva, and the sea ports of Puerto Cortés and Omoa. The Atlantic coast of the Department of Cortés is known for its many excellent beaches.

Cortés is the economic heartland of Honduras, as the Sula Valley is the country&#x27;s main agricultural and industrial region. US banana companies arrived in the area in the late 19th century, and established vast plantations, as well as infrastructure to ship the fruit to the United States. San Pedro Sula attracted substantial numbers of European, Central American, and Palestinian and Lebanese immigrants. Industry flourishes in the department, and Cortés today hosts most of the country&#x27;s assembly plants, known as maquilas.

==History==
The area of the modern city of Shirahama was within ancient Kii Province. The hot springs in this area have been used since ancient times and are mentioned on several occasions in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and throughout the pre-modern period. The seaside of Shirahama was famous for its white quartz sands, which had also been celebrated in poetry as a &quot;makurakotoba&quot; for &quot;whiteness&quot;. These sands were exploited commercially for their high silica content for use in glass production and were also exported. The village of was established with the creation of then modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. From 1919, local volunteers began developing the seaside area in competition to the older springs in the mountains and efforts to drill for a hot spring source were successful by 1922. A local commercial shipping company, the Shirahama Onsen Motor Co., Ltd., began promotion of the area as a resort. This received a boost by a visit of Emperor Showa in 1929. The village was promoted to town status on March 1, 1940. The neighboring village of Minami-Tonda was annexed on March 15, 1955 and Nishi-Tonda on July 1, 1958. On March 1, 2006 the town of Hikigawa, from Nishimuro District, was merged into Shirahama.

The opening of Nanki Shirahama Adventure World in the 1990s have gradually changed the focus of the resort towards families.

===White-sand beach===
One of Shirahama&#x27;s main attractions is its crescent-shaped white-sand beach; “Shirahama” means “white beach” or “white bay”. In the 1960s, when Shirahama was connected by rail to Osaka, the city became a popular tourist destination, and blocky white hotel towers were erected along the coastal road. The increased development accelerated erosion, and the famous sand began to wash into the sea. Worried that the town of White Beach would lose its white beach, according to a city official, Wakayama Prefecture began in 1989 to import sand from Perth, Australia, 4,700 miles away. 745,000 cubic meters was imported over 15 years.

The territory of El Paraíso was initially part of the departments of Tegucigalpa (renamed Francisco Morazán in 1943) and Olancho after Central America gained its independence in 1825. The department of El Paraíso was created with municipalities taken from the departments of Tegucigalpa and Olancho on 28 May 1869 by congressional decree in the third political division of Honduras, during the presidential term of José María Medina. Initially El Paraíso included the jurisdictions of Danlí, Yuscarán and Texiguat, along with the town of Guinope. On December 28, 1878, Texiguat was moved to the department of Tegucigalpa, but subsequently moved back into El Paraíso on October 28, 1886.

The departmental capital is Yuscarán. El Paraíso is bordered to the north by the department of Olancho, to the south by the department of de Choluteca, to the east by the Republic of Nicaragua, and to the west by the department of Francisco Morazán.

<text>The lilangeni (plural: emalangeni, ISO 4217 code: &quot;SZL&quot;) is the currency of Eswatini and is subdivided into 100 cents. It is issued by the Central Bank of Eswatini (in swazi &quot;Umntsholi Wemaswati&quot;) and is authorised by the king and his family. The South African rand is also accepted in Eswatini. Similar to the Lesotho loti, there are singular and plural &quot;abbreviations&quot;, namely L and E, so where one might have an amount L1, it would be E2, E3, or E4.

==History==

It was introduced in 1974 at par with the South African rand through the Common Monetary Area, to which it remains tied at a one-to-one exchange rate.

The currency&#x27;s name derives from &quot;emaLangeni&quot;, a term used to describe the ancestors of the Swazi people who migrated to Swaziland in the 18th–19th centuries.

==Coins==
The currency&#x27;s name derives from &quot;emaLangeni&quot; (&quot;people from the Sun&quot;), a term used to describe the ancestors of the Swazi people who migrated to Swaziland in the 18th–19th centuries.

In 1974, coins for 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents and 1 lilangeni were introduced, with the 1 and 2 cents struck in bronze and the others struck in cupro-nickel. Except for the 1 lilangeni, the coins were not round, with the 1 and 50 cents dodecagonal, the 2 cents square with rounded corners and the 5, 10 and 20 cents scalloped.

The 2 cents was last struck in 1982, whilst, in 1986, round, copper-plated steel 1 cent and nickel-brass 1 lilangeni coins were introduced. These were followed, in 1992, by nickel-plated-steel 5 and 10 cents and nickel-brass-plated-steel 1 lilangeni coins. In 1995, 2 and 5 emalangeni coins were introduced.

From 2009 to 2011 new coins were introduced in copper-plated steel (5c and 10c), nickel-plated steel (20c, and a 50c piece which was never released into circulation) and brass-plated steel (L1). These were similar sizes to the existing coins but lighter due to the changed metal composition.

In February 2016, a new series of coins dated 2015 was introduced and all previous coins were recalled and demonetised. The new coins have similar designs to the previous coins, but with slightly different sizes and weights. The 10c-50c are in nickel-plated steel and the L1-E5 are in aluminium-bronze. 1c-5c coins are no longer in use.

The nickel-brass L1 coin dated 1986 and brass coins dated 1995-2009 had the same dimensions and composition as the British £1 coins introduced in 1983, and thus have sometimes been used fraudulently in British vending machines with the value of L1 decreasing from £0.36 in 1986 to £0.05 in 2015, when those L1 coins were demonetised.

==Banknotes==

On 6 September 1974, the Monetary Authority of Swaziland introduced notes in denominations of 1 lilangeni, 2, 5 and 10 emalangeni, with 20 emalangeni notes following in 1978. In 1981, the Central Bank of Swaziland took over paper money production, first issuing notes commemorating the Diamond Jubilee of King Sobhuza II. Between 1982 and 1985, it introduced non-commemorative notes for E2, E5, E10, and E20. The 50 emalangeni notes were introduced in 1990. The E2 and E5 notes were replaced by coins in 1995, whilst 100 and 200 emalangeni notes were introduced in 1996 and 1998, respectively, with the E200 notes commemorating the 30th anniversary of independence. On September 5, 2008, the Central Bank of Swaziland issued 100-, and 200-emalangeni notes to commemorate the 40th birthday of King Mswati III and the 40th anniversary of independence. On November 1, 2010, the Central Bank of Swaziland has issued a new series of banknotes with enhanced security features.

Parts of the coastal area of the town are within the limits of the Yoshino-Kumano National Park and include the Hashiguiiwa Rocks, which are a National Natural Monument.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Wakayama Prefecture
*Kozagawa, to the north
*Nachikatsuura, to the east
*Susami, to the west

===Climate===
Kushimoto has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Kushimoto is 17.5 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2515 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.9 °C, and lowest in January, at around 8.1 °C. Kushimoto has a very wet climate. The area is subject to typhoons and the moist winds of the Kuroshio Current in summer. Kushimoto is famous as the Typhoon Ginza (after Ginza in Tokyo). The wettest month was September 1929 with whilst in January 2010 the town received no rain for the second time since records began in 1913 and had the lowest monthly humidity on record at 47 percent. The heaviest daily rainfall was on 17 October 1939.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Kushimoto has decreased steadily over the past 60 years.

On April 1, 2005, Kushimoto absorbed the town of Koza, from Higashimuro District, to become the new town of Kushimoto.

==History==
The area of the modern city of Shingū was within ancient Kii Province. During the Edo period it was part of the holdings of Kishū Domain, under a cadet branch of the Tokugawa clan, headquartered at Wakayama Castle.

In 1791 the US captains John Kendrick of the &quot;Lady Washington&quot; and William Douglas of the &quot;Grace&quot; visited Kushimoto, hoping to open a trading relationship with Japan. However, they did not receive a warm reception. News was sent to Wakayama Castle, which sent troops. However, Kendrick and Douglas had departed two days before the troops arrived. The result of this first visit of Americans to Japan was largely symbolic for the United States. For Japan it resulted in a new system of alarms and coastal patrols, increasing Japan&#x27;s isolation under &quot;sakoku&quot;.

Kushimoto village was established on April 1, 1889, within Nishimuro District, Wakayama with the creation of the modern municipalities system. On September 16, 1890, the Ertuğrul incident occurred, in which an Imperial Ottoman Navy frigate on a goodwill visit to Japan floundered in a typhoon off of Kushimoto with great loss of life.

Kushimoto was elevated to town status on November 12, 1907. Over the next decades, the town grew as a result of numerous mergers with the surrounding village, annexing Fujihashi in 1924, Arita, Shiono-Misaki, Tanami, and Wabuka in 1955 and Oshima in 1958. On April 1, 2005, Kushimoto merged with the town of Koza, from Higashimuro District. Due to its strong ties with the city of Shingū both for political and economic reasons, Kushimoto became part of Higashimuro District upon this merger.

Being in a strategic location, Kushimoto was home to many military installations during World War II, including the Kushimoto Seaplane Base and Shionomisaki Airfield. Both bases were attacked by the United States Navy and Air Force in 1945, including a naval bombardment on the night of 24/25 July. Shionomisaki Airfield now serves as a small base for the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force.

Kushimoto (or specifically, Cape Shionomisaki) was the epicenter of the Great Nankai earthquake, a magnitude 8.0 earthquake that struck the area on December 21, 1946, at 4:19am. This triggered a tsunami that enveloped the central part of town. Most of the Fujihashi neighborhood was destroyed but has since been rebuilt. There are memorials around town marking the event, including signposts indicating how far the tsunami had penetrated inland. Of the 269 casualties in Wakayama Prefecture, the majority were in Kushimoto and in the city of Kainan.

On September 26, 1959, a typhoon hit Kushimoto directly, causing a large scale storm and storm surge damage mainly in the Tokai region (especially Nagoya). This typhoon, called the Isewan Typhoon, killed 5,000 people and was the deadliest typhoon in modern Japan.

===Name origin===
There are two widely accepted views of the origin of the name &quot;Kushimoto&quot; frm. The first is explained by a strange tree growing in a shrine in Cape Shionomisaki, whose seedling is thought to have floated from a far off island to its current resting place. An archaic compound form of the Chinese character for &quot;kushi&quot; (串) is said to have meant &quot;strange tree&quot;; in combination with the second character &quot;moto&quot; (本), the name is supposed to represent &quot;strange tree&#x27;s origin.&quot; Another explanation dictates that the &quot;kushi&quot; character is a visual abstraction of the town&#x27;s layout; Cape Shionomisaki and Oshima act as the smaller upper &quot;kuchi&quot; (口) radical, while the mainland acts as the larger lower one. The &quot;bo&quot; (｜) radical that strikes through both of the others is said to represent the isthmus that runs through the town.

Kushimoto is famous for its many coastal rock formations, including Hashigui-Iwa and Umikongo. Cape Shionomisaki, located in the southern tip of the town, has a park and tower marking the southernmost point of Honshū. The island of Kii-Oshima, connected to the main town via a bridge, is home to two museums:
* The Turkish Memorial and Museum, located on the southeastern end of the island, commemorates the foundering and sinking of the Turkish ship &quot;Ertugrul&quot; on the rocky Oshima shore. As of 2005, there was discussion of salvaging the wreckage with a Turkish team to exhibit it in the local museum.
*The United States Friendship Museum commemorates the visit of the brig &quot;Lady Washington&quot; and the brig &quot;Grace,&quot; which in 1791 took place decades before Commodore Matthew Perry&#x27;s famed landing in Japan and opening of diplomatic relations with the United States. The museum also hosts a collection of American artifacts and items of nostalgia from its sister city, Hemet, in the United States.

Kushimoto had been the northernmost point where coral was found in Japan, beyond the Darwin Point of 29N latitude. Nevertheless, the meandering Kuroshio warm current that normally protects the coral, led to influx of cold water in 2018 that killed off most of the coral. Both water too hot or too cold can bleach coral.

===Water sports===
The surrounding wetlands and coastal areas in Kushimoto are designated areas of conservation through the Ramsar Convention of 1971. They have since become popular spots for scuba diving, with numerous diving establishments along National Highway 42.

The Kozagawa River, regulated by the Shichikawa Dam, is one of three rivers in southern Wakayama Prefecture known for kayaking.

Though waves are relatively tame compared with worldwide standards, Kushimoto is a popular surfing spot for locals and people from the bigger cities in the Kansai area.

===Annual events and festivals===
In late January or early February is the Shiono-Misaki Fire Festival. During this event, the large grassy field that designates Honshū&#x27;s southernmost tip is ritually burned. Spectators may walk through the fire as it progresses through the field.

In February is the Oshima Boat Race. Festivals grounds are set up at Oshima Port, and two boats ritually race to and from the port on the mainland Kushimoto.

In August, the Summer Fireworks Festival takes place at Kushimoto Port.

In October is the Sunset Marathon. The marathon&#x27;s route winds through Oshima and Shiono-Misaki.

<doc id="556100" wikidata="Q592807" url="?curid=556100" title="Music of Bhutan">
<text>The music of Bhutan is an of its culture and plays a leading role in transmitting social values. Traditional Bhutanese music includes a wide spectrum of subgenres, ranging from folk to religious song and music. Some genres of traditional Bhutanese music intertwine vocals, instrumentation, and theatre and dance, while others are primarily vocal or instrumental. The much older traditional genres are distinguished from modern popular music such as rigsar.

==Instruments==

Instruments used in both traditional and modern genres of Bhutanese music include the lingm (six-holed flute), the chiwang (Tibetan two-stringed fiddle), and the dramnyen (similar to a large three-stringed rebec); modern musicians often update these instruments for use in rigsar.

Other traditional instruments include tangtang namborong (four-holed bamboo bass flute), kongkha (bamboo mouth harp), and gombu (bull or buffalo horn). Newer instruments include the yangchen, brought from Tibet in the 1960s.

While Bhutanese folk music often employs stringed instruments, religious music usually does not. Unlike many countries, Bhutanese folk music is almost never incorporated into popular music.

==Religious music==
Bhutan was first united in the 17th century, during the reign of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (1594–1652); the same period saw a great blossoming of folk music and dance. Religious music is usually chanted, and its lyrics and dance often reenact namtars, spiritual biographies of saints, and feature distinctive masks and costumes. Today, Bhutan has a robust tradition of monastic song and music not normally heard by the general public. The language used in these lyrics is generally Chöke.

;Cham

The Cham dance is one of the most conspicuous religious musical subgenres in Bhutan, and is shared among Tibetan Buddhists in Tibet and in other countries, having roots in the 8th century. Lama and founder of Bhutan Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal is also credited with introducing many masked dances into Bhutanese tradition. Performed during modern Bhutanese tsechus (festivals), cham dances act both to achieve enlightenment and to destroy evil forces in a sort of ritual purification. Ordinary people watch cham dances in order to receive a spiritual benefit and merit. The music and choreography of the cham dance are heavily associated with Tibetan Buddhism, however some common features derive directly from the Bön religion. The Dramyin Cham in particular is a focal point of many modern tsechus.

==Folk music==

The influence of Drukpa Buddhism and Buddhist music on Bhutanese culture is such that many folk songs and chanting styles are derived from Drukpa music. While some lamas and monks are credited for composing certain Bhutanese folk music, the majority of its creators are unknown or anonymous. Like religious music, the lyrics of folk music are most often in literary Dzongkha or Chöke, however there are also several traditional songs in Khengkha and Bumthangkha.

Vocal and behavioral discipline for traditional singing requires thorough training in order to master the correct pitch, facial expressions, gestures, and overall conduct while performing.

Along with traditional music, masked dances and dance dramas are common participatory components of folk music, and feature prominently at Bhutanese tsechus (festivals). Energetic dancers wearing colorful wooden or composition face masks employ special costumes and music to depict a panoply of heroes, demons, death heads, animals, gods, and caricatures of common people. The dances enjoy royal patronage and preserve not only ancient folk and religious customs but also perpetuate the art of mask making.

Bhutanese folk songs include a variety of subgenres, including &quot;zhungdra&quot; and &quot;boedra&quot;, as well as several minor varieties such as &quot;zhey&quot; and &quot;zhem&quot;, &quot;yuedra&quot;, &quot;tsangmo&quot;, &quot;alo&quot;, &quot;khorey&quot;, and &quot;ausa&quot;. Traditional song and dance are also an integral part of archery in Bhutan, known for lyrics that range from literary and sublime to provocative and burlesque.

;Zhungdra

Zhungdra (Dzongkha: གཞུང་སྒྲ་; Wylie: &quot;gzhung-sgra&quot;; &quot;center music&quot;) is one of the two dominant forms of Bhutanese folk music. It was developed in the 17th century, and is associated with the folk music of the central valleys of Paro, Thimphu, and Punakha, the heart of the Ngalop cultural area. Although considered secular, the lyrics of zhungdra songs often tell Buddhist allegories, such as &quot;Yak Legbi Lhadar&quot;, in which the singer tells of his former life as a yak slaughtered in connection with a non-Buddhist ritual in the Gasa District.

Zhungdra is characterized by the use of extended vocal tones in complex patterns which slowly decorate a relatively simple instrumental melody. Untrained singers, even those with natural singing ability, typically find it challenging to sing zhungdra. This has reduced the popularity of zhungdra compared with rigsar, the fast-paced pop Bhutanese music style based on electronic synthesizers.

;Boedra

Boedra (Dzongkha: བོད་སྒྲ་; Wylie: &quot;bod-sgra&quot;; &quot;Tibetan music&quot;) is the second of the two dominant forms of Bhutanese folk music. Instrumentation for boedra often includes the chiwang, which symbolizes a horse. In contrast to Zhungdra, Boedra evolved out of Tibetan court music.

;Zhey and zhem
The paired zhey and zhem (Dzongkha: གཞས་/གཞས་མོ་; Wylie: &quot;gzhas&quot;/&quot;gzhas-mo&quot;) are elaborately choreographed vocal performances often performed during tsechus (festivals). They contain elements of both zhungdra and boedra. The quick-stepped zhey are performed by men, while the more flowing zhem are women&#x27;s dances. Zheys originate in the 17th century, and although there is considerable variety among contemporary zheys, most of them share common tunes and dance formats. Dancers originally performed barefoot and without any elaborate uniform, however the tradition of wearing long gowns, headgear and traditional boots was established in the 1970s.

In honor of the 2011 royal wedding, Bhutanese dancers performed four major zheys (Goen Zhey of Gasa, Wang Zhey of Thimphu, Nub Zhey of Trongsa, Woochupai Zhey of Paro) and four minor zheys (Auley of Laya, Locho of Sha, Bonghur Zhey of Haa, and Miritsemoi Zhey of Chukha).

The Goen Zhey is of central importance among all zheys. Its origins lie in the coming of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, the founder of Bhutan. According to tradition, when he came in 1616 to at Bangdekha below Wakeyla, a place between Gasa and Laya, the people of Goen in Gasa offered the elaborate dance. Requiring two days and 21 dancers to complete, the dance has 25 intricate steps. Dancers wear red woolen gho, black tego undershirt, and red-and-white kabney in the fashion of ancient warriors. The zheypon (dance master) wears an elaborate headdress.

The Woochhu Zhey, from the Wochu Village (&quot;Jackal River Village&quot;; modern Woochhu Village in Lungnyi Gewog, Paro), also bases its origin in Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, first performed by a lama in the procession to receive the Zhabdrung.

One particularly endangered performance is the Wang Zhey of Thimphu. According to tradition, it began with a commoner from the Wang valley who went to Laya. On his way, he stopped at the Gasa tshechu where he saw Goen Zhey for the first time. Inspired, he stayed to learn it. After returning to Wang, he taught his people the zhey in exchange for a fee of salt for every song. In 1620, with small changes, it was performed in Thimphu during the consecration ceremony of Chagri Monastery. Thereafter, it was performed regularly in receptions for important Tibetan Drukpa lamas. Though the Wang Zhey was once routine in rabneys, archery matches, and weddings of well-to-do families, it is now less frequently performed, and young Bhutanese do not know its significance.

;Tsangmo 
Tsangmo (Dzongkha: ཙང་མོ་; Wylie: &quot;tsang-mo&quot;), also considered a literary genre, are very popular in Bhutan. They consist of sung couplets, the first of which describes a relevant scenario, followed by the second couplet, which conveys a point such as love, hate, abuse, or ridicule. Tsangmo may be sung in a call-and-reply fashion, and may be a means of competition.

;Lozey
Lozey (Dzongkha: བློ་ཟེ་; Wylie: &quot;blo-ze&quot;), literally translated as &quot;ornaments of speech,&quot; refer to two distinct vocal traditions. The first is a short exchange lines, while the second is a collection of ballads that vary from region to region. They all concern traditional customs, dress, and literature. Rich in metaphor, they are known and recited by ordinary people in modern language. Like Tsangmo, Lozey may be sung in a call-and-reply fashion, and may be a means of competition. Certain Lozey are sung in vernacular language.

==Popular music==

The modern popular rigsar genre (Dzongkha རིག་གསར་; Wylie: &quot;rig-gsar&quot;; &quot;new type&quot;) emerged in the 1960s. Rigsar can be contrasted from most traditional music in its updated electronic instrumentation, faster rhythm, and vernacular language, especially Dzongkha and Tsangla. Its context can also be contrasted, as rigsar is a common feature of Bhutanese television and film. Some of the earliest rigsar tunes were translations of contemporary popular Hindi songs. The first Bhutanese rigsar hit was &quot;Zhendi Migo&quot;, covered the popular Bollywood filmi song &quot;Sayonara&quot; from the film &quot;Love in Tokyo&quot;. Since the 1960s, a great number of Bhutanese artists have covered or produced a staggering volume of rigsar music.

Rigsar gained popularity on the Bhutan Broadcasting Service, making way for the rigsar band Tashi Nyencha to establish the first recording studio in Thimphu in 1991. Prior to this period, Bhutanese people primarily listened to filmi and other kinds of Indian pop music. Rigsar is the dominant style of Bhutanese popular music, and dates back to the late 1980s. The first major music star was Shera Lhendup, whose career began after the 1981 hit &quot;Jalam Jalam Gi Ashi&quot;.

By the end of the 1980s, rigsar was no longer so popular, its detractors citing repetitive, simple tunes that were often copied directly from foreign music. Since 1995, with founding of the Norling Drayang recording label, rigsar has returned to relative popularity as a fusion of elements and instruments from English language pop, Indian and Nepalese music. Rigsar remains ubiquitous in Bhutan, heard in on public streets, in taxis, and on buses, and even used by the government to deliver health and sanitation education.

There is also a small underground metal scene with bands like Forsaken 

Bhutan has also been seeing a boom in the popular music such as the B-Pop show that was held to promote creativity in May 2018 by M-Studio in collaboration with the Ministry of Information and Communications.

==Institutions==
The Royal Academy of Performing Arts (RAPA) has worked under royal prerogative to document, preserve, and promote traditional Bhutanese music, song, and dance since 1954. Its activities are overseen by the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of Bhutan. The Academy&#x27;s performers participate in festivals, tour schools within Bhutan, and perform for tourists.

The Institute of Language and Cultural Studies (ILCS) at Semtokha, Thimphu, was the only university level institute to offer elective courses on traditional and modern Bhutanese music, song, and dance as of 2003.

Aa-Yang Ensemble, started by Jigme Drukpa in 2010, is a private performing group. The ensemble includes members from north, east and south of Bhutan, making it one of the more culturally diverse music groups in Bhutan. In 2013 the group toured Sweden for 23 days.

Khuju Luyang, a private performing arts group with international stage presence. Khuju Luyang won the folk music and dance competition in 2006 and received the silver medal from the Royal Government of Bhutan for preservation of folk dance and music.

<doc id="556101" wikidata="Q1023770" url="?curid=556101" title="Taiji, Wakayama">
<text>is a town located in Higashimuro District, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 2960 in 1567 households and a population density of 510 persons per km2. The total area of the town is . Taiji is the smallest municipality by area in Wakayama Prefecture.

==Geography==
Taiji is located on a forked peninsula that juts out into the Kumano Sea near the southern tip of the Kii Peninsula, with a rias coastline. On one side is Moriura Bay and on the other is Taiji Bay. It is surrounded by the town of Nachikatsuura on three sides.

===Neighboring municipalities===
Wakayama Prefecture
*Nachikatsuura

==Climate==
Taiji has a Humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Taiji is 16.5 °C. The average annual rainfall is 2564 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.1 °C, and lowest in January, at around 6.8 °C. 

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Taiji has decreased steadily over the past 40 years.

==History==
The area of the modern town of Taiji was within ancient Kii Province. Taiji has long been well known as a whaling town and spearheaded the development of more sophisticated whaling techniques in the 17th century. The village of Taiji was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889 with the merger of the earlier hamlets of Taiji and Moriura. Taiji was elevated to town status on April 1, 1925. In 1988, a ruling by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) caused Taiji to suspend commercial whaling. However, the town continues to hunt small whales and dolphins. Taiji&#x27;s annual dolphin hunt is a subject of controversy and the town faces continued pressure from protest groups.

===Whaling and Taiji ===

Taiji has been primarily known as a whaling town. Japanese traditional whaling techniques were developed here in the 17th century, and the commercial hunting and catching of pilot whales and dolphins remains a major source of income for its residents to this day. Wada Chūbei organized the group hunting system (刺手組) and introduced a new handheld harpoon in 1606. Wada Kakuemon, later known as Taiji Kakuemon, invented the whaling net technique called &quot;Amitori hō&quot; (網取法) to increase the safety and efficiency of whaling. This method was applied for more than 200 years.

The people of Taiji experienced great loss and economic hardship after an incident in 1878, when a large group of whalers were lost at sea while hunting a whale. The whale was harpooned, but was strong enough to pull the whaling boats out to sea. Refusing to cut the whale loose until it was too late, many whalers drowned or were otherwise adrift and lost at sea as a result. Around one hundred whalers died in the course of this event. After the Russo-Japanese War, Taiji&#x27;s whaling industry became buoyant again as it became a base for modern whaling. When the practice of Antarctic whaling started, Taiji provided crews for the whaling fleet. In 1988, Taiji suspended commercial whaling as a result of a ruling by the International Whaling Commission (IWC).

==== Dolphin drive hunting ====

Whalers from the town of Taiji continue to hunt small whales such as melon-headed and pilot whales as well as dolphins, commercial activities which are not regulated by the International Whaling Commission. Whalers from Taiji also participate in the annual hunt for minke whales which is sanctioned under IWC regulations for scientific purposes. The number of dolphins available for catch in FY2023 set by the Fisheries Agency was 10,920 for Japan as a whole, and the number of dolphins available for catch allocated to the Taiji dolphin drive hunt was 1824. Of these, the actual number of dolphins caught in Japan as a whole was 614, compared to 492 in the Taiji dolphin hunt. 

====Documentary====
The town&#x27;s annual dolphin drive hunt was featured in the 2009 Oscar-winning documentary &quot;The Cove&quot;. Some people who appeared in the film, including Taiji assemblyman Hisato Ryono, have stated that the documentary&#x27;s producers lied to them about the film&#x27;s intended content. Since the film&#x27;s release, more activists than before, many from outside Japan, have gone to Taiji to observe or protest the annual dolphin slaughter which usually begins in 1 September and continues through the end of February. As a result, the town announced in July 2011 that it was reinforcing its police presence at the cove where the killings take place by operating a 24-hour, 10-man kōban in order to prevent confrontations between activists and locals.

====Mercury concerns====
In 2009, hair samples from 1,137 Taiji residents were tested for mercury by the National Institute for Minamata Disease (NIMD). The average amount of methylmercury found in the hair samples was 11.0 parts per million for men and 6.63 ppm for women, compared with an average of 2.47 ppm for men and 1.64 ppm for women in tests conducted in 14 other locations in Japan. From the total population, 182 Taiji residents who showed relatively high mercury levels over 7.2 ppm, including 18 men and 5 women over 50 ppm, underwent further medical testing to check for neurological symptoms of mercury poisoning. None of the Taiji residents displayed any of the traditional symptoms of mercury poisoning, according to the institute. However, the &quot;Japan Times&quot; reported that the mortality rate for Taiji and nearby Kozagawa, where dolphin meat is also consumed, is over 50% higher in comparison to some other similarly sized villages in other regions of Japan. However, the study makes no mention of specific causes of death nor does it mention relevant age demographics: as Taiji has 1,225 elderly residents (aged 65 years or older) and Kozagawa has 1,531 elderly residents, both towns have more elderly residents, up to twice as many, as towns mentioned in the study, such as Hiezuson, Tottori (699).

The chief of the NIMD, Kōji Okamoto, said, &quot;We presume that the high mercury concentrations are due to the intake of dolphin and whale meat. There were not any particular cases of damaged health, but seeing as how there were some especially high concentration levels found, we would like to continue conducting surveys here.&quot; NIMD ran further tests in 2010 and 2011. Hair from 700 Taiji residents were tested for mercury; 117 males and 77 females who showed over 10 ppm underwent further neurological tests. Again, no participant displayed any signs of mercury poisoning. In August 2012, a research project to investigate the health effects of mercury on children was launched by NIMD.

==Government==
Taiji has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of 10 members. Taiji, collectively with the other municipalities of Higashimuro District contributes two members to the Wakayama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Wakayama 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Commercial fishing dominates the local economy.

==Education==
Taiji has one public elementary school and one public middle school operated by the town. The town does not have a high school.

==Transportation==

===Highway===

== Local attractions ==

=== Museums ===
* Taiji Whale Museum opened in 1969. It exhibits more than 1,000 items related to whales and whaling, including skeletal displays of several whale species. It keeps captive dolphins obtained by the Taiji dolphin drive hunt on display and uses the museum as a transfer station prior to distributing animals to dolphinariums worldwide.
* Hiromitsu Ochiai Baseball Museum commemorates Japanese baseball player Hiromitsu Ochiai who won the Nippon Professional Baseball triple crown three times.
* Ishigaki Museum commemorates painter Eitaro Ishigaki who hailed from Taiji. His wife Ayako founded the museum in 1991.

=== Onsens (hot springs) ===
There are two small-scale onsens (hot springs) in the town:
* Natsusa (or Nassa) Onsen
* Taiji Onsen

=== Festivals ===
Taiji&#x27;s summer festival is called the Taiji Isana Festival that is held annually on 14 August. &quot;Isana&quot; is an old Japanese word for whales. Its annual autumn festival is the &quot;Taiji Kujira Matsuri&quot; (&quot;Taiji Whale Festival&quot;), held on the first Sunday of November. Both festivals are heavily whale-themed and the attractions include the &quot;Kujira Odori&quot; (&quot;whale dance&quot;) and the &quot;Kujira Daiko&quot; (&quot;whale drumming&quot;). The Kujira Odori is a traditional dance that whalers performed in the past to celebrate a good catch. This dance is unique, as the dancers only move their upper bodies as they dance sitting in whaling boats. It is identified as intangible cultural heritage by Wakayama Prefecture. The Kujira Daiko is also traditional and its performance describes a battle between a large whale and small whaling boats.

== Sister cities ==
* Broome, Western Australia, Australia, since 1981; suspended by the Broome city council in August 2009 in protest against the annual dolphin slaughter. The decision on suspension was reversed in October 2009. Historic ties between the two towns date back to the early 1900s when Japan became instrumental in laying the groundwork of Broome&#x27;s pearling industry.
* Hakuba, Nagano (Japan), since 1984
* Klaksvík, Faroe Islands, since 2018

== Notable people ==
* Eitaro Ishigaki (1893–1958), an American artist
* Kiwako Taichi (1943–1992), an actress; originally her surname was pronounced Taiji, but she decided to pronounce it Taichi as a stage name.

<doc id="556102" wikidata="Q736919" url="?curid=556102" title="Nokia 9500 Communicator">
<text>Nokia 9500 Communicator is a mobile phone produced by Nokia, introduced on 24 February 2004 and released in November 2004. It runs on the Symbian-based Series 80 platform.

The 9500 is equipped with a 150 MHz Texas Instruments OMAP processor and 64 megabytes of SDRAM. It features two screens – a fully functional interior screen, and a restricted-function external screen, which operates on a stripped-down Series 40 user interface.

Connectivity features of the 9500 include: Bluetooth, infrared, USB, Wi-Fi (Nokia&#x27;s first device with Wi-Fi), CSD, HSCSD, GPRS and EDGE. It has send and receive fax facilities (without scanner) and multi-account POP3/IMAP email client.

The built-in Web browser, a Nokia-branded version of Opera, is able to render both WAP and HTML Web pages. Like others in the Communicator series, the 9500 has a full QWERTY keyboard.

Built-in software includes a word processor, spreadsheet and presentation program, which are compatible with the Microsoft Office suite equivalents; also featured is an MP3 player. In addition to the software applications provided by Nokia, a large range of third-party software is available; many programs written for older Nokia Communicators are compatible with the 9500 and new software can be written in C++ or OPL.

The 9500 also runs Java ME applications, but some do not make full use of the unusually large and wide screen, so that many existing Java games will run, but only use the top left hand corner of the screen. It supports storage on a Multimedia Card (MMC) of up to 2 GB (on later firmware versions).

The 9500 is only available with 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 1900 MHz radios. There were many rumors that a U.S. version with 850 MHz radio capability was going to be made, but it never materialized. Nokia was producing simultaneously the 9500 and its related version, the 9300, so they decided to make a U.S. version of the 9300 instead.

<text>The Kelham Island Museum is an industrial museum on Alma Street, alongside the River Don, in the centre of Sheffield, England. It was opened in 1982.

==The site==
The island on which it is located is man-made, resulting from the construction of a mill race, in the 12th century, which diverted water from the River Don to power a corn mill belonging to the Lord of the Manor. It is reported that the island was subsequently named after the Town Armourer, Kellam Homer, who owned a grinding workshop on the neighbouring goit (mill race) in 1637.

Having remained meadowland for much of its existence, John Crowley&#x27;s Iron Foundry was built on the site in 1829 and continued in operation until the 1890s. The site was flooded on 11 March 1864, when the Dale Dyke Dam broke, damaging workshops on the site. Crowley&#x27;s Iron Foundry was replaced by a power station in 1899 to provide electricity for the new fleet of trams in the city. The power station operated until the 1930s when the building was used for storage and workshops. These are the premises now occupied by the museum, along with Russell Works, once occupied by Messers Wheatman and Smith. Russell Works now houses the Hawley Gallery and the Crucible Shop, both part of the museum.

==The museum==

The museum houses exhibitions on science and Sheffield industry, including examples of reconstructed little mesters&#x27; workshops and England&#x27;s largest surviving Bessemer converter. This object received an Engineering Heritage Award in 2004 from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. (Henry Bessemer&#x27;s pilot converter is on display at the Science Museum (London)). The museum gives tours to local schools and has regular demonstrations of the 1905 River Don Engine, a 12,000 horsepower (9 MW) steam engine, which originally powered a local armour plate rolling mill. The engine is remarkable for its ability to change direction very quickly, a feature that was necessary for the efficient rolling of heavy steel. The engine rolled steel for nuclear reactors towards the end of its life (it was last used in production in 1978 at the River Don Works). The museum is operated by the Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust. It is an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage.

The museum houses the prototype Sheffield-Simplex car, one of only three know to remain. The car was described as, &quot;one of the best and most remarkable vehicles available, representing the highest point to which motor design has yet attained&quot;, by &quot;The Times&quot; in 1913. The Benjamin Huntsman Clock, the first manufactured object to contain Crucible Cast Steel, can be seen in the Enid Hattersley Gallery. The museum also has a large photographic archive which is used by authors for illustrating local history books.

Since 2009, the museum has housed the workshop of Stan Shaw, a little mester. Shaw worked there and demonstrated knife making to the public until his death in 2021.

== Flooding ==
The museum suffered heavily in the Sheffield flood of July 2007 with water over a metre deep inundating the site, causing £1.5 million of damage. Paintings by William Cowen and Henry Perlee Parker, a drawing master at Sheffield&#x27;s Wesleyan College, were some of the objects damaged by the floodwater. The museum was closed for 18 months, reopening in September 2008. It received a national commendation from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) for its recovery from the 2007 floods. The site is now protected by new flood defences which were completed in December 2011.
