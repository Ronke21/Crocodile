<text>Chebotarev&#x27;s density theorem in algebraic number theory describes statistically the splitting of primes in a given Galois extension &quot;K&quot; of the field formula_1 of rational numbers. Generally speaking, a prime integer will factor into several ideal primes in the ring of algebraic integers of &quot;K&quot;. There are only finitely many patterns of splitting that may occur. Although the full description of the splitting of every prime &quot;p&quot; in a general Galois extension is a major unsolved problem, the Chebotarev density theorem says that the frequency of the occurrence of a given pattern, for all primes &quot;p&quot; less than a large integer &quot;N&quot;, tends to a certain limit as &quot;N&quot; goes to infinity. It was proved by Nikolai Chebotaryov in his thesis in 1922, published in .

A special case that is easier to state says that if &quot;K&quot; is an algebraic number field which is a Galois extension of formula_1 of degree &quot;n&quot;, then the prime numbers that completely split in &quot;K&quot; have density 

:1/&quot;n&quot;

among all primes. More generally, splitting behavior can be specified by assigning to (almost) every prime number an invariant, its Frobenius element, which is a representative of a well-defined conjugacy class in the Galois group 

:&quot;Gal&quot;(&quot;K&quot;/&quot;Q&quot;).

Then the theorem says that the asymptotic distribution of these invariants is uniform over the group, so that a conjugacy class with &quot;k&quot; elements occurs with frequency asymptotic to 

:&quot;k&quot;/&quot;n&quot;.

== History and motivation ==

When Carl Friedrich Gauss first introduced the notion of complex integers &quot;Z&quot;[&quot;i&quot;], he observed that the ordinary prime numbers may factor further in this new set of integers. In fact, if a prime &quot;p&quot; is congruent to 1 mod 4, then it factors into a product of two distinct prime gaussian integers, or &quot;splits completely&quot;; if &quot;p&quot; is congruent to 3 mod 4, then it remains prime, or is &quot;inert&quot;; and if &quot;p&quot; is 2 then it becomes a product of the square of the prime &quot;(1+i)&quot; and the invertible gaussian integer &quot;-i&quot;; we say that 2 &quot;ramifies&quot;. For instance, 

: formula_3 splits completely;
: formula_4 is inert;
: formula_5 ramifies.

From this description, it appears that as one considers larger and larger primes, the frequency of a prime splitting completely approaches 1/2, and likewise for the primes that remain primes in &quot;Z&quot;[&quot;i&quot;]. Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions demonstrates that this is indeed the case. Even though the prime numbers themselves appear rather erratically, splitting of the primes in the extension 

: formula_6

follows a simple statistical law.

Similar statistical laws also hold for splitting of primes in the cyclotomic extensions, obtained from the field of rational numbers by adjoining a primitive root of unity of a given order. For example, the ordinary integer primes group into four classes, each with probability 1/4, according to their pattern of splitting in the ring of integers corresponding to the 8th roots of unity. 
In this case, the field extension has degree 4 and is abelian, with the Galois group isomorphic to the Klein four-group. It turned out that the Galois group of the extension plays a key role in the pattern of splitting of primes. Georg Frobenius established the framework for investigating this pattern and proved a special case of the theorem. The general statement was proved by Nikolai Grigoryevich Chebotaryov in 1922.

== Relation with Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem ==

The Chebotarev density theorem may be viewed as a generalisation of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem on arithmetic progressions. A quantitative form of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem states that if &quot;N&quot;≥&quot;2&quot; is an integer and &quot;a&quot; is coprime to &quot;N&quot;, then the proportion of the primes &quot;p&quot; congruent to &quot;a&quot; mod &quot;N&quot; is asymptotic to 1/&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot;=φ(&quot;N&quot;) is the Euler totient function. This is a special case of the Chebotarev density theorem for the &quot;N&quot;th cyclotomic field &quot;K&quot;. Indeed, the Galois group of &quot;K&quot;/&quot;Q&quot; is abelian and can be canonically identified with the group of invertible residue classes mod &quot;N&quot;. The splitting invariant of a prime &quot;p&quot; not dividing &quot;N&quot; is simply its residue class because the number of distinct primes into which &quot;p&quot; splits is φ(&quot;N&quot;)/m, where m is multiplicative order of &quot;p&quot; modulo &quot;N;&quot; hence by the Chebotarev density theorem, primes are asymptotically uniformly distributed among different residue classes coprime to &quot;N&quot;.

==Formulation==

In their survey article, give an earlier result of Frobenius in this area. Suppose &quot;K&quot; is a Galois extension of the rational number field Q, and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) a monic integer polynomial such that &quot;K&quot; is a splitting field of &quot;P&quot;. It makes sense to factorise &quot;P&quot; modulo a prime number &quot;p&quot;. Its &#x27;splitting type&#x27; is the list of degrees of irreducible factors of &quot;P&quot; mod &quot;p&quot;, i.e. &quot;P&quot; factorizes in some fashion over the prime field F&quot;p&quot;. If &quot;n&quot; is the degree of &quot;P&quot;, then the splitting type is a partition Π of &quot;n&quot;. Considering also the Galois group &quot;G&quot; of &quot;K&quot; over Q, each &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; is a permutation of the roots of &quot;P&quot; in &quot;K&quot;; in other words by choosing an ordering of α and its algebraic conjugates, &quot;G&quot; is faithfully represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;. We can write &quot;g&quot; by means of its cycle representation, which gives a &#x27;cycle type&#x27; &quot;c&quot;(&quot;g&quot;), again a partition of &quot;n&quot;.

The &quot;theorem of Frobenius&quot; states that for any given choice of Π the primes &quot;p&quot; for which the splitting type of &quot;P&quot; mod &quot;p&quot; is Π has a natural density δ, with δ equal to the proportion of &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; that have cycle type Π.

The statement of the more general &quot;Chebotarev theorem&quot; is in terms of the Frobenius element of a prime (ideal), which is in fact an associated conjugacy class &quot;C&quot; of elements of the Galois group &quot;G&quot;. If we fix &quot;C&quot; then the theorem says that asymptotically a proportion |&quot;C&quot;|/|&quot;G&quot;| of primes have associated Frobenius element as &quot;C&quot;. When &quot;G&quot; is abelian the classes of course each have size 1. For the case of a non-abelian group of order 6 they have size 1, 2 and 3, and there are correspondingly (for example) 50% of primes &quot;p&quot; that have an order 2 element as their Frobenius. So these primes have residue degree 2, so they split into exactly three prime ideals in a degree 6 extension of &quot;Q&quot; with it as Galois group.

==Statement==
Let &quot;L&quot; be a finite Galois extension of a number field &quot;K&quot; with Galois group &quot;G&quot;. Let &quot;X&quot; be a subset of &quot;G&quot; that is stable under conjugation. The set of primes &quot;v&quot; of &quot;K&quot; that are unramified in &quot;L&quot; and whose associated Frobenius conjugacy class &quot;F&quot;v is contained in &quot;X&quot; has density
:formula_7
The statement is valid when the density refers to either the natural density or the analytic density of the set of primes.

===Effective Version===
The Generalized Riemann hypothesis implies an effective version of the Chebotarev density theorem: if &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a finite Galois extension with Galois group &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; a union of conjugacy classes of &quot;G&quot;, the number of unramified primes of &quot;K&quot; of norm below &quot;x&quot; with Frobenius conjugacy class in &quot;C&quot; is
:formula_8
where the constant implied in the big-O notation is absolute, &quot;n&quot; is the degree of &quot;L&quot; over Q, and Δ its discriminant.

The effective form of Chebotarev&#x27;s density theory becomes much weaker without GRH. Take &quot;L&quot; to be a finite Galois extension of &quot;Q&quot; with Galois group &quot;G&quot; and degree &quot;d&quot;. Take formula_9 to be a nontrivial irreducible representation of &quot;G&quot; of degree &quot;n&quot;, and take formula_10 to be the Artin conductor of this representation. Suppose that, for formula_11 a subrepresentation of formula_12 or formula_13, formula_14 is entire; that is, the Artin conjecture is satisfied for all formula_11. Take formula_16 to be the character associated to formula_9. Then there is an absolute positive formula_18 such that, for formula_19,
:formula_20
where formula_21 is 1 if formula_9 is trivial and is otherwise 0, and where formula_23 is an exceptional real zero of formula_24; if there is no such zero, the formula_25 term can be ignored. The implicit constant of this expression is absolute. 

===Infinite extensions===
The statement of the Chebotarev density theorem can be generalized to the case of an infinite Galois extension &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot; that is unramified outside a finite set &quot;S&quot; of primes of &quot;K&quot; (i.e. if there is a finite set &quot;S&quot; of primes of &quot;K&quot; such that any prime of &quot;K&quot; not in &quot;S&quot; is unramified in the extension &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot;). In this case, the Galois group &quot;G&quot; of &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot; is a profinite group equipped with the Krull topology. Since &quot;G&quot; is compact in this topology, there is a unique Haar measure μ on &quot;G&quot;. For every prime &quot;v&quot; of &quot;K&quot; not in &quot;S&quot; there is an associated Frobenius conjugacy class &quot;F&quot;v. The Chebotarev density theorem in this situation can be stated as follows:

:Let &quot;X&quot; be a subset of &quot;G&quot; that is stable under conjugation and whose boundary has Haar measure zero. Then, the set of primes &quot;v&quot; of &quot;K&quot; not in &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;F&quot;v ⊆ X has density
::formula_26

This reduces to the finite case when &quot;L&quot; / &quot;K&quot; is finite (the Haar measure is then just the counting measure).

A consequence of this version of the theorem is that the Frobenius elements of the unramified primes of &quot;L&quot; are dense in &quot;G&quot;.

==Important consequences==
The Chebotarev density theorem reduces the problem of classifying Galois extensions of a number field to that of describing the splitting of primes in extensions. Specifically, it implies that as a Galois extension of &quot;K&quot;, &quot;L&quot; is uniquely determined by the set of primes of &quot;K&quot; that split completely in it. A related corollary is that if almost all prime ideals of &quot;K&quot; split completely in &quot;L&quot;, then in fact &quot;L&quot; = &quot;K&quot;.

<text>Lois Hamilton (October 14, 1943 – December 23, 1999) was an American model, author, aviator, artist and actress.

==Life and career==
Lois Hamilton was born Lois Irene Yanessa on October 14, 1943, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Francis Yanessa and Helen.
She studied at Temple University in her native Philadelphia before attending the University of Florence in Florence, Italy, where she received degrees in psychology and fine arts.

Her looks brought her an opportunity with the Ford Modeling Agency where she became one of its top models during the 1970s. Hamilton graced the covers of many magazines, including &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Vogue Italia&quot;, &quot;Prevue&quot;, &quot;Neue Revue Illustrierte&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Paris Match&quot;, &quot;Hello!&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;. Some of her ad campaigns included those for Chanel, Clairol, Halston, Pucci, and Hermès; in all, she appeared in over 150 commercials worldwide during her career.

Hamilton moved to Hollywood, where she made a successful transition from model to actress. Within a year, she landed more TV stints than any other actress at her agency. She worked with such notables as Ivan Reitman, Neil Simon, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford, Burt Reynolds, John Candy, Roger Moore, Bill Murray, Jane Fonda, Dean Martin, Carl Reiner, David Carradine and Sammy Davis Jr.. Under the name Lois Hamilton or Lois Areno, she appeared in films such as &quot;Stripes&quot;, &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; and &quot;Honky Tonk Freeway&quot; and on television shows like &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; and &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot;.

When she was not involved in a feature film or television project, Hamilton took to the skies, where she was a licensed private pilot. She logged over 600 hours in the air and was an accomplished aerobatic pilot, flying her 1936 German biplane. Hamilton was also an accomplished sculptor, painter and writer. She exhibited her bronze sculptures and oil paintings in many one-woman shows in Los Angeles.

==Death==
Hamilton fled the country for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, rather than face prison time for a driving under the influence with an accident. On December 23, 1999, Hamilton locked herself in her hotel room at the Sheraton Hotel in Rio de Janeiro, where she consumed a fatal overdose of sleeping pills. She was 56 years old. She was interred in Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery in North Hollywood, California.

<text>Ella Rosa Giovianna Oliva Grasso (née Tambussi; May 10, 1919 – February 5, 1981) was an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who served as the 83rd governor of Connecticut from January 8, 1975, to December 31, 1980, after rejecting past offers of candidacies for Senate and governor. She was the first woman elected governor in Connecticut and the fourth woman to be elected governor of a U.S. state. She is also the first female governor to not be the spouse or widow of a former governor. She resigned as governor due to her battle with ovarian cancer.

Grasso started in politics as a member of the League of Women Voters and Democratic speechwriter. She was first elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives in 1952 and later became the first female floor leader in 1955. She was then elected as Secretary of the State of Connecticut in 1958 and served until 1971. Grasso went on to serve two terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1970 to 1974. Then she was elected governor in 1974 and re-elected in 1978.

==Early life==
Ella Rosa Giovianna Oliva Tambussi was born in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, to Italian immigrant parents Maria Oliva and James Giacomo Tambussi, a mill worker. Ella Tambussi learned to speak fluent Italian from her parents. She attended Chaffee School in Windsor. Although she excelled at Chaffee and was named most likely to become mayor in the school year book, Tambussi claimed she often felt out of place as someone from a poor mill town. She went on to study sociology and economics at Mount Holyoke College, in South Hadley, Massachusetts, where she earned her B.A. in 1940. Two years later, she earned a master&#x27;s degree, also from Mount Holyoke.

After graduation, Grasso served as a researcher for the War Manpower Commission in Washington, D.C., rising to the position of assistant director of research before leaving the Commission in 1946. She married Thomas Grasso, a school principal, in 1942; they had two children, Susanne and James. 
Together the Grassos owned a movie theater in Old Lyme. In the summers, the couple would operate the theater, with Ella Grasso selling tickets at the box office. During Grasso&#x27;s tenure in the United States House of Representatives, her family remained in Connecticut while Grasso commuted home from Washington, D.C., on weekends. Thomas Grasso retired when his wife became governor.

==Career==
===Early politics===
Grasso&#x27;s entry into politics came in 1942 when she joined the League of Women Voters. In 1943, she became a speechwriter for the Connecticut Democratic Party. After graduating from Mount Holyoke College she joined the Republicans until she switched in 1951 to the Democratic Party to support incumbent Governor Chester Bowles. Through the Connecticut Democratic Party, she met and became an ally of John Moran Bailey. Bailey would become a key figure in Grasso&#x27;s career, recognizing her as someone who could appeal to voters, particularly women and Italian voters in the state.

In 1952, Grasso was elected to the Connecticut House of Representatives and served until 1957. She became first woman to be elected Floor Leader of the House in 1955. As a state representative, Grasso worked to eliminate counties as a level of government in Connecticut.

===Secretary of State===
In 1958, Grasso was elected Secretary of the State of Connecticut and was re-elected in 1962 and 1966. She was an architect of the state&#x27;s 1960 Constitution. In 1961, Grasso chose not to attend the national convention for the National Association of Secretaries of State in Arizona despite the trip being state funded, as she considered it to be of negligible value and would only approve other officials to go to national conventions that would benefit the state.

In 1962, the Supreme Court ruled in Baker v. Carr that the 14th Amendment applies to state apportionment and that federal courts are open to lawsuits challenging state legislative districts, leading to further lawsuits over redistricting. After Reynolds v. Sims, the Joint Committee on Constitutional Conventions convened to hear proposals for a constitutional convention by the Connecticut General Assembly to bring the state constitution in line with federal rulings. A special election was ordered to choose the eighty-four delegates who would attend the convention, and Grasso was elected as one of them. As Secretary of State, Grasso swore in the eighty-four delegates divided equally among both parties and was selected as Democratic floor leader by the forty-two Democratic delegates.

Grasso was the first woman to chair the Democratic State Platform Committee and served from 1956 to 1968. She served as a member of the Platform Drafting Committee for the 1960 Democratic National Convention. Grasso was the co-chairman for the Resolutions Committee for the Democratic National Conventions of 1964 and 1968.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
During the 1970 election cycle, Grasso was considered a candidate for higher statewide or federal office. After Senator Thomas J. Dodd was censured in 1967, his seat was left up and Ella was considered a possible candidate for the 1970 Senate race with the Democratic Town Committees of Windsor Locks, Glastonbury, and New Milford voting to endorse her if she would announce a Senate campaign. Thomas L. Loy, her Republican opponent for Secretary of State in 1962, asked her to run for governor. Stephen Minot, a novelist who had run for Congress in 1966, asked her to run for the Sixth House District. Sitting Sixth District Congressman Thomas Meskill chose to run for governor, leaving his district open and on March 17, 1970, Ella announced that she would run for the Democratic nomination for that district. Grasso faced Republican Richard Kilborn in the general election and narrowly defeated him by 4,063 votes.

During her tenure, Grasso served on the Veterans&#x27; Affairs and Education and Labor House committees. In December 1971, she and other House members signed a telegram to President Nixon protesting Operation Linebacker II and asking to halt all bombing in Vietnam; Grasso was the only representative from Connecticut to sign the telegram.

Grasso was reelected to the House in 1972 against John F. Walsh, with 140,290 votes to his 92,783 votes.

===Governorship===
In 1973, a gubernatorial poll conducted by the AFL–CIO projected that Grasso would defeat incumbent Governor Meskill by 46% to 39%, and a campaign committee was later organized, although Grasso had not yet announced her intention to run. On January 8, 1974, she announced that she would run for the governorship and filed with the secretary of state.

In order to secure the gubernatorial nomination, a candidate would need to receive the support of 607 out of 1,213 delegates to the state convention, with multiple primaries being held beforehand to select the delegates. Grasso participated in a difficult primary against Attorney General Robert Killian, who received the support of multiple party leaders, but after narrowly winning the seventy delegates of Hartford by two thousand votes, she effectively secured the nomination with her pledged delegates. Democratic Party leader John Moran Bailey preferred Killian as the party nominee, and hoping to avoid a primary that would negatively affect the Democratic nominee&#x27;s chance in the general election, Bailey convinced Killian to drop out in exchange for the lieutenant gubernatorial nomination. By the time of the gubernatorial nomination balloting, all of her opponents had dropped out except for Norwalk Mayor Frank Zullo, who dropped out during the convention, and as she was the only candidate to receive at least twenty percent of the delegate votes appearing on the primary ballot, no primary was held. On July 20, 1974, Grasso was given the Democratic nomination by the delegates with acclamation. Her opponent was Republican Representative Robert Steele whom she defeated by 200,000 votes. Grasso became the first woman to be elected governor who was not the wife or widow of a previous governor.

Upon taking office, Connecticut had an $80 million budget deficit, so Grasso promised fiscal responsibility. In 1975, she laid off 505 state employees, decreased her promise of giving $25 million to cities with federal revenue sharing money to $6 million, returned to the state treasury a $7,000 raise she was legally required to take and sold the state&#x27;s limousine and plane.

During the 1976 presidential election, Grasso supported Senator Henry M. Jackson in the primaries and was presented as a possible vice presidential nominee for the Democratic Party, with the Young Democrats of Connecticut attempting to convince her to present herself as a candidate, although municipal leaders angry over the decreased federal revenue sharing funds promised to prevent her nomination, and she stated that she was not interested. Grasso later served as co-chair of the national convention.

Following John Moran Bailey&#x27;s death, there was no longer someone strong enough to forestall a primary challenge between Grasso and Lieutenant Governor Robert K. Killian. In December 1978, Killian announced his gubernatorial campaign, but after defeating her primary challenge, Grasso was re-elected in 1978 with little difficulty against Representative Ronald A. Sarasin.

A high point of Grasso&#x27;s career was her decisive handling of a particularly devastating snowstorm in February 1978. Known as &quot;Winter Storm Larry&quot; and now known as &quot;The Blizzard of &#x27;78&quot; this storm dropped around 30 inches of snow across the state, crippling highways and making virtually all roads impassable. Grasso &quot;Closed the State&quot; by proclamation, forbade all use of public roads by businesses and citizens, and closed all businesses, effectively closing all citizens in their homes. This relieved the rescue and cleanup authorities from the need to help the mounting number of stuck cars and instead allowed clean-up and emergency services for shut-ins to proceed. The crisis ended on the third day, and she received accolades from all state sectors for her leadership and strength.

In March 1980, Grasso was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and resigned the governorship on December 31. Shortly before her resignation, the mayor and city council of Torrington, Connecticut, signed a proclamation thanking her for her service as governor, secretary of state, and representative.

==Death and legacy==
On February 5, 1981, less than a year after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer and less than six weeks after leaving office, Grasso died at Hartford Hospital after suffering a heart attack and organ failure after falling into a coma earlier in the day. She was survived by her husband and their two children. Following her death she was laid in state from February 8 to 9 at the Connecticut State Capitol and was later buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in Windsor Locks.

In 1981, President Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded Grasso the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame inducted her in 1993. She was a member of the inaugural class inducted into the Connecticut Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1994; the Ella Tambussi Grasso Center for Women in Politics is located there.

Metro North named Shoreliner I car 6252 after her. Ella T. Grasso Southeastern Technical High School in Groton is named after her. The Ella T. Grasso Turnpike in Windsor Locks is named after her, as are Ella Grasso Boulevard in New Britain, the Ella T. Grasso building in the University of Connecticut&#x27;s Hilltop Apartments, and Ella T. Grasso Boulevard (often referred to by New Haven locals simply as &quot;The Boulevard&quot;) in New Haven.

Over two years after her death, Arch Communications Corp. won a construction permit for Hartford&#x27;s channel 61 in September 1983; James Grasso was a minority partner in Arch Communications. Arch Communications Corp. planned to memorialize Grasso by using the call letters &quot;WETG&quot; for channel 61, as Grasso&#x27;s initials were ETG; the station would go on the air September 17, 1984, as WTIC-TV, but was still dedicated in Grasso&#x27;s honor.

<text>Hulhulé (), located at , is an island in the North Malé Atoll of the Maldives where the city&#x27;s airport, Velana International Airport, is located. The island has no permanent population.

It is one of the islands closest to the capital island Malé. Hulhulé is considered a ward of Malé.

The Sinamalé Bridge links the island with Malé. The bridge, which has two car lanes and separate lanes for motorcycles and pedestrians, opened on 30 August 2018.

==Velana International Airport==
The Velana International Airport is located on this island along with some official premises, e.g. Maldives Meteorological Service. The airport is served internationally by various holiday charter flights (mostly from Europe) and several scheduled carriers including Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airlines, Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, British Airways, Turkish Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines and Sri Lankan Airlines. In addition to serving as an international and domestic airport, Hulhulé is also home to the seaplane terminal operated by Trans Maldivian Airways. The island also serves as a hub for travellers wishing to connect to a domestic flight to the further outlying atolls, such as Laamu.

Before the airport was built, it was the home of the aboriginal Giraavaru people and other settlers who resided for convenience and agricultural purposes. People who lived in Hulhulé used to commute to Malé to sell their produce. In 1968, they were forced to abandon their ancestral home on Giraavaru island under an Islamic regulation that did not recognise communities with fewer than 40 adult males who could form a quorum at the Friday prayers.

The Giraavaru people were ferried across the atoll lagoon to Hulhulé Island. When the airport was extended, they were shifted across to Malé and housed in a few blocks in newly reclaimed areas in the Maafannu district.

== Location within Malé City ==
The airport island Hulhulé is located northeast of Malé Island, between it and new artificial residential Hulhumalé Island, to which it is connected by a causeway.
==Accommodation==
One hotel, the Hulhule Island Hotel, is located on the island. This hotel is more for transit passengers over-nighting as opposed to a true resort hotel.

<text>Firestarter is a science fiction-horror thriller novel by Stephen King, first published in September 1980. It tells the story of a young girl, Charlie McGee, with the ability of pyrokinesis, whose destructive force a ruthless government agency tries to harness for their own purposes. In July and August 1980, two excerpts from the novel were published in &quot;Omni&quot;. The novel entered the New York Times&#x27; Best-Sellers List on August 24th, 1980. In 1981, &quot;Firestarter&quot; was nominated as Best Novel for the British Fantasy Award, Locus Poll Award, and Balrog Award. In 1984, it was adapted into a film. A miniseries follow-up to the film, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2002 on the Sci-Fi Channel and a remake from Blumhouse Productions was released on 13 May 2022. The book is dedicated to author Shirley Jackson: &quot;In Memory of Shirley Jackson, who never needed to raise her voice.&quot;

==Plot summary==
Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; and Charlene &quot;Charlie&quot; McGee are a father/daughter pair on the run from a government agency known as The Shop. During his college years, Andy had participated in a Shop experiment dealing with &quot;Lot 6&quot;, a drug with hallucinogenic effects similar to LSD. The drug gave his future wife, Victoria “Vicky” Tomlinson, minor telekinetic abilities and him a telepathic form of mind control he refers to as &quot;the push&quot;. They both also developed telepathic abilities. Andy&#x27;s and Vicky&#x27;s powers were physiologically limited; in his case, overuse of the push gives him crippling migraine headaches and minute brain hemorrhages, but their daughter Charlie develops a frighteningly strong pyrokinetic ability.

The novel begins &quot;in medias res&quot; with Charlie and Andy on the run from Shop agents in New York City, the latest in a series of attempts by the Shop to capture Andy and Charlie following a disastrous raid on the McGee family in suburban Ohio. After years of Shop surveillance, a botched operation to take Charlie leaves her mother dead; Andy, receiving a psychic flash while having lunch with colleagues, rushes home to discover his wife murdered and his daughter kidnapped. He then uses his push ability to track the trail of Charlie and The Shop agents, catching up to them at a rest stop on the Interstate. He uses the push to incapacitate the Shop&#x27;s agents, leaving one blind and the other comatose. Charlie and Andy flee, and begin a life of running and hiding, using assumed identities. They move several times to avoid discovery before the Shop catches up to them in New York.

Using a combination of the push, Charlie&#x27;s power, and hitchhiking, the pair escape through Albany, New York and are briefly taken in by a farmer named Irv Manders near the fictional town of Hastings Glen, New York; however, they are tracked down by Shop agents, who attempt to kill Andy and take Charlie at the Manders farm. At Andy&#x27;s instruction, Charlie unleashes her power, incinerating the entire farm and fending off the agents, killing a few of them. With nowhere else to turn, the pair flees to the fictional town of Tashmore, Vermont and takes refuge in a cabin that had once belonged to Andy&#x27;s grandfather.

With the Manders farm operation disastrously botched, The Shop&#x27;s director, Captain James &quot;Cap&quot; Hollister, calls in a Shop assassin named John Rainbird to capture the fugitives. Rainbird, a Cherokee and a Vietnam War veteran, is intrigued by Charlie&#x27;s power and eventually becomes obsessed with her, determined to befriend her and eventually kill her. This time the operation is successful, and both Andy and Charlie are taken by the Shop.

The pair are separated and imprisoned at the Shop headquarters, located in the fictional Washington, D.C. suburb of Longmont, Virginia. With his spirit broken, Andy becomes an overweight drug addict, seemingly loses his power, and is eventually deemed useless by the Shop. Charlie, however, defiantly refuses to cooperate with the Shop and won’t demonstrate her power for them. Six months pass until a power failure provides a turning point for the two: Andy, sick with fear and self-pity, somehow regains the push – subconsciously pushing &quot;himself&quot; to overcome his addiction – and Rainbird, masquerading as a simple janitor, befriends Charlie and gains her trust.

By pretending to still be powerless and addicted, Andy manages to gain crucial information by pushing his psychiatrist. Under Rainbird&#x27;s guidance, Charlie begins to demonstrate her power, which has grown to fearsome levels. After the suicide of his psychiatrist, Andy is able to meet and push Cap, using him to plan his and Charlie&#x27;s escape from the facility, as well as to finally communicate with Charlie. Rainbird discovers Andy&#x27;s plan, however, and decides to use it to his advantage.

Andy&#x27;s plan succeeds, and he and Charlie are reunited in a barn for the first time in six months, but Rainbird is already there, planning to kill them both. A crucial distraction is provided by Cap, who is losing his mind from a side effect of being pushed. Andy pushes Rainbird into leaping from the upper level of the barn, breaking his leg. Rainbird then shoots Andy in the neck and fires another shot at Charlie, but she uses her power to melt the bullet in midair, and then sets Rainbird and Cap on fire. Mortally wounded, Andy then instructs Charlie to use her power to escape and to inform the public, to make sure the government cannot do anything like this ever again. After he dies, Charlie, grief-stricken and furious, sets the barn on fire; she then uses her pyrokinesis to kill the employees and blow up their getaway vehicles. The military is called, but Charlie obliterates their vehicles; when they fire at her, she melts their bullets. Charlie blows up the building, leaving the entire Shop facility burning, with almost everyone dead.

The event is covered up by the government and released to the media as a terrorist firebomb attack. The Shop quickly reforms, under new leadership, and begins a manhunt for Charlie, who has returned to the Manders farm. After some deliberation, she comes up with a plan and leaves the Manders&#x27;, just ahead of Shop operatives, and heads to New York City. She decides on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine as an unbiased, honest media source with no ties to the government, and the book ends as she arrives to tell them her story.

<text>A samosa () () ( Persian: سمبوسه) from the Persian word sambosag (&quot;سنبوسگ&quot;) (meaning &#x27;triangular pastry&#x27;) is a fried South Asian and West Asian snack. It is a pastry with a savory filling, mostly vegetables, spiced potatoes, onions, and peas, but also meat or fish. It is made in different shapes, including triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the region. Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier. Sweet versions are also made. Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of India, South Asia, West Asia, Central Asia, Portugal, East Africa and their South Asian diasporas.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;samosa&quot; derives from the Hindustani word (, ), traceable to the Middle Persian word () &#x27;triangular pastry&#x27;. Similar pastries are called in Arabic from Persian; medieval Arabic recipe books sometimes spell it , which are all borrowed from Persian &quot;sanbosag&quot;.

==History==

The South Asian samosa is believed to be derived from a medieval precursor from the Middle East that was baked and not deep fried. The earliest mention of a samosa precursor was by Abbasid-era poet Ishaq al-Mawsili, praising the &quot;sanbusaj&quot;. Recipes are found in 10th–13th-century arab cookery books, under the names &quot;sanbusak&quot;, &quot;sanbusaq&quot;, and &quot;sanbusaj&quot;, all deriving from the Persian word . In Iran, the dish was popular until the 16th century, but by the 20th century its popularity was restricted to certain provinces (such as the of Larestan). Abolfazl Beyhaqi (995–1077), an Iranian historian, mentioned it in his history, &quot;Tarikh-e Beyhaghi&quot;.

The Central Asian &quot;samsa&quot; was introduced to the Indian subcontinent in the 13th or 14th century by chefs from the Middle East and Central Asia who cooked in the royal kitchens for the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate. Amir Khusro (1253–1325), a scholar and the royal poet of the Delhi Sultanate, wrote around 1300 CE that the princes and nobles enjoyed the &quot;samosa prepared from meat, ghee, onion, and so on&quot;. Ibn Battuta, a 14th-century traveler and explorer, describes a meal at the court of Muhammad bin Tughluq, where the &quot;samushak&quot; or &quot;sambusak&quot;, a small pie stuffed with minced meat, almonds, pistachios, walnuts and spices, was served before the third course of &quot;pulao&quot;. &quot;Nimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi&quot;, a medieval Indian cookbook started for Ghiyath Shah, the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate in central India, mentions the art of making samosa. The &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot;, a 16th-century Mughal document, mentions the recipe for qottab, which it says, &quot;the people of Hindustan call &quot;sanbúsah&quot;&quot;.

The samosa gained its popularity due to its savory flavor and convenience. The pocket-sized food item was a readily available snack for workers and travelers across Central and South Asia.

==Regional varieties==

=== India ===
The samosa is prepared with an all-purpose flour (locally known as maida) and stuffed with a filling, often a mixture of diced and cooked or mashed boiled potato, onions, green peas, lentils, ginger, spices and green chili. A samosa can be vegetarian or non-vegetarian, depending on the filling. The entire pastry is deep-fried in vegetable oil or (rarely) ghee to a golden brown. It is served hot, often with fresh green chutney, such as mint or coriander chutney, or tamarind chutney. It can also be prepared in a sweet form. Samosas are often served in &quot;chaat&quot; (a type of street food), along with the traditional accompaniments of either a chickpea or a white pea preparation, drizzled with yogurt, tamarind chutney and green chutney, and garnished with chopped onions, coriander, and &quot;chaat masala&quot;.

In the Indian states of Assam, Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, &quot;singara&quot;s or &quot;shingra&quot;s () (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller than in other parts of India, with a filling consisting chiefly of cooked diced potato, peanuts, and sometimes raisins. &quot;Shingra&quot;s are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all-purpose flour) and fried. Good &quot;shingra&quot;s are distinguished by flaky textures akin to that of a savory pie crust.

Singaras may be eaten as a tea-time snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form. Bengali singaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than other singaras or their samosa cousins. Singara filled with cauliflower mixture is a popular variation. Non-vegetarian varieties of singaras are mutton singaras and fish singaras. There are also sweet versions, such as coconut singara, as well as others filled with &quot;khoya&quot; and dipped in sugar syrup that are known as Mishti Shingara.

In the city of Hyderabad, a smaller version of samosa with a thicker pastry crust and minced meat filling, referred to as &quot;lukhmi&quot;, is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling.

In the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, samosas are slightly different, being folded differently, more like Portuguese , with a different style of pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, and green chilis, and is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in South India are made in different sizes, whose fillings are influenced by local food habits, and may include meat.

=== Bangladesh ===
Both flat-shaped (triangular) and full-shaped (tetrahedron/triangular pyramid) samosas are popular snacks in Bangladesh.

The meat samosa contains minced meat (lamb, beef, or chicken) and is popular as a snack food in Pakistan.

In Pakistan, the samosas of Karachi are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from Faisalabad are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called (; &quot;paper samosa&quot; in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a wonton or spring roll wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. Sweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup.

Another Pakistani snack food, popular in Punjab, is known as . This is a combination of a crumbled samosa, along with spiced chickpeas (channa chaat), yogurt, and chutneys. Alternatively, the samosa can be eaten on its own with chutney on the side.

<text>Gilles Grégoire (May 6, 1926 – November 22, 2006) was a co-founder of the Parti Québécois.

Born in Quebec City, Quebec, the son of Joseph-Ernest Grégoire, he was elected in 1962 to the House of Commons of Canada with the Ralliement des créditistes. He left that party in 1966 and was elected president of the Ralliement national, a pro-sovereignty party on August 21, 1966.

In October 1968 the Ralliement national merged with René Lévesque&#x27;s Mouvement Souveraineté-Association to form the Parti Québécois.

He was elected as a member of the National Assembly of Quebec in the riding of Frontenac in the 1976 general election and was re-elected in the 1981 general election. In 1983, he was sentenced to two years minus a day in jail due to his sexual abuse of several minor girls, which resulted in him becoming an independent for the rest of his term.

He died in Quebec City at 80.

<text>The Shields River is a tributary of the Yellowstone River, long, in Meagher and Park Counties Montana in the United States.

It rises in the Gallatin National Forest in the Crazy Mountains in northern Park County. It flows west, then south, between the Bridger Range to the west and the Crazy Mountains to the east, past Wilsall and Clyde Park. It joins the Yellowstone approximately 10 mi (16 km) northeast of Livingston.
The Shields River was named for John Shields (explorer), a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

The river hosts native Yellowstone cutthroat trout and Mountain whitefish as well as introduced brown and rainbow trout.

<doc id="535407" wikidata="Q1051824" url="?curid=535407" title="Cave In">
<text>Cave In is an American rock band that formed in 1995 in Methuen, Massachusetts. The band&#x27;s lineup solidified with the 1998 release of &quot;Until Your Heart Stops&quot; through Hydra Head Records, and their early albums were prominent in the metalcore scene. The band later experimented with other genres, receiving mainstream recognition for their 2003 RCA Records album &quot;Antenna&quot; and its lead single &quot;Anchor,&quot; which had an overall alternative rock style. The group went on hiatus in 2006, later reforming in 2009 with the release of the &quot;Planets of Old&quot; EP, followed by the &quot;White Silence&quot; LP in 2011, both of which saw a return to Cave In&#x27;s earlier and heavier sound.

==History==

===Formation and early releases (1995–1998)===
Cave In was formed by Jay Frechette and Stephen Brodsky in the early spring of 1995, when the two began to write songs in Jay&#x27;s parents&#x27; basement. They named themselves &quot;Cave-In&quot; as a homage to the Codeine song, &quot;Cave-In&quot;, from the album &quot;Frigid Stars&quot;. The initial line-up consisted of Frechette on vocals, Brodsky on guitar and vocals, Adam McGrath on second guitar, JR Conners on drums and Justin Matthes on bass. They would soon release a demo and a handful of split 7-inch releases with bands such as Gambit, Piebald and Early Grace, and see Matthes briefly replaced by Andy Kyte. 1997 saw Cave In&#x27;s first release; a self-titled 7-inch on Aaron Turner&#x27;s Hydra Head Records. Following that release, the band embarked on a three-week East Coast tour, with a handful of dates supporting Morning Again and Bird of Ill Omen. That tour was, however, cut a week short due to Jay Frechette&#x27;s prior obligations to join and tour with Boston-based Ten Yard Fight. After Frechette returned from a month on tour with Ten Yard Fight it was a mutual decision for him to leave Cave In and to join Ten Yard Fight full-time. At this point, Dave Scrod stepped in for a short-lived tenure as interim vocalist. In 1998, most tracks from previous 7-inch releases and recordings were compiled to form &quot;Beyond Hypothermia&quot;.

===&quot;Until Your Heart Stops&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; (1998–2001)===
Two weeks before the band was to record their first proper full-length, Scrod left the band, pushing guitarist Stephen Brodsky to a position as vocalist, and Caleb Scofield filled in the then-vacant position on bass. Their 1998 debut studio album &quot;Until Your Heart Stops&quot; featured Brodsky as lead vocalist. The album&#x27;s release was followed by extensive touring.

Before their next full-length, Cave In began experimenting with their sound offering &quot;Creative Eclipses&quot;, a five-song EP which indicated a space rock direction the band would then pursue for several years, as opposed to their metal roots. Then, in 2000, they released &quot;Jupiter&quot;, receiving a good deal of press. The band was featured in &quot;Spin Magazine&quot;″s &quot;Sound Advice&quot; section, where their new sound was described as &quot;emo-metal Radiohead&quot;, though the band themselves rejected this categorization. &quot;Jupiter&quot; also caught the attention of major labels, who began courting the band after its release.

===RCA Records and &quot;Antenna&quot; (2001–2004)===
In April 2001, the band signed to RCA Records. In 2002, they recorded and released a six-song EP for Hydra Head, titled &quot;Tides of Tomorrow&quot;, with an even further-expanded melodic approach. In 2003, the band released &quot;Antenna&quot;, their debut for RCA. &quot;Antenna&quot; had more success than previous albums and Cave In was chosen to play the second stage on the 2003 Lollapalooza tour. After Lollapalooza, Cave In toured Europe in support of the Foo Fighters and Muse. The band began to revisit their metal roots during concerts, and started writing heavier material, which ultimately led to a mutual agreement to cut ties with RCA Records shortly after.

===&quot;Perfect Pitch Black&quot; and hiatus (2005–2006)===
Cave In returned to Hydra Head Records and released &quot;Perfect Pitch Black&quot; on September 13, 2005.

Following the release of Perfect Pitch Black, Conners departed from the band, due to an injury and temporarily relocating to Germany, and was replaced by Converge drummer Ben Koller. With Koller, the band recorded the songs &quot;Shapeshifter&quot; and &quot;Dead Already,&quot; which were released as a cassette single that was sold during 2005–2006 tours. According to postings on Hydra Head Records website news, Adam McGrath was temporarily listed as &quot;ex-Cave In guitarist&quot; in his new band Clouds.

In November 2006, Cave In announced that they were officially on hiatus.

===Reformation, &quot;Planets of Old&quot; and &quot;White Silence&quot; (2009–2016)===
In April 2009, Cave In publicly announced they had ended their more than three-year hiatus. The band recorded a new four-song EP, &quot;Planets of Old&quot;, that was originally exclusive to vinyl from Hydra Head Records, and first made available at their reunion show on July 19, 2009, at Great Scott&#x27;s in Allston, Massachusetts. The EP was later released on CD in January 2010 with a bonus DVD of Cave In&#x27;s reunion show. Two songs from the EP, &quot;Retina Sees Rewind&quot; and &quot;Cayman Tongue&quot;, were released through iTunes. Cave In chose to make &quot;Planets of Old&quot; a short EP instead of a full-length because it was less expensive and faster to record and release. Commenting on the duration of recording, Steve Brodsky stated, &quot;we didn&#x27;t really wanna make a big deal out of it. In the past, we&#x27;ve had more than a couple instances of spending far too long into making a recording. [...] It was a good exercise for us to give ourselves a very strict amount of time to record and then move on.&quot;

Looking forward, Brodsky announced in a January 2010 interview that Cave In will be more selective about their touring schedule, and that future releases from the band might be more focused on a digital medium. Brodsky uploaded a live audio recording of a new song titled &quot;Centered&quot; in July 2010 on YouTube. The song comes from Cave In&#x27;s recording sessions for an upcoming studio album, and first since &quot;Perfect Pitch Black&quot; in 2005. The new album &quot;White Silence&quot; was released on May 24, 2011, through Hydra Head Records.

Shortly after tours in support of &quot;White Silence&quot;, Cave In entered an undeclared-hiatus state as all of the band members shifted focus on their other respective projects. On December 7, 2014, Cave In performed live for the first time in 3 years, opening for Doomriders&#x27; tenth anniversary show.

===Death of Caleb Scofield and &quot;Final Transmission&quot; (2017–2020)===
Cave In engaged in at least two &quot;jam sessions&quot; in late 2017 and early 2018 with &quot;some new stuff in the works,&quot; presumably for a planned new release.

On March 28, 2018, Scofield died in a car accident after striking a toll booth on the Everett Turnpike in Bedford, New Hampshire.

The band played and scheduled a series of benefit shows to raise money for Scofield&#x27;s family, with his brother Kyle Scofield and Nate Newton of Converge covering his parts. Scofield&#x27;s side project, Old Man Gloom, shared the bill at each event, with Brodsky taking Scofield&#x27;s place in its lineup. The 2018 shows also featured an encore set of Zozobra songs, performed by a revolving lineup of musicians who had participated in that project.

On January 2, 2019, Cave In announced plans to release a new studio album. The band released its sixth studio album &quot;Final Transmission&quot; through Hydra Head on June 7, 2019. The album is composed of practice-space demos that all feature contributions from Scofield and were finished with mixing by Andrew Schneider and mastering by James Plotkin.

===Signing to Relapse and &quot;Heavy Pendulum&quot; (2021–present)===
Cave In signed to Relapse Records in July 2021 and released their seventh studio album through the label on May 20, 2022. The album title was revealed in March 2022 as &quot;Heavy Pendulum&quot;, and the announcement was accompanied by the release of a single titled &quot;New Reality&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Blinded by a Blaze&quot;, was released on April 5; the song&#x27;s music video was released the same day. The third single, &quot;Blood Spiller&quot;, was released on April 26. The fourth single, &quot;Reckoning&quot;, is the first Cave In song to be fully written by guitarist Adam McGrath and was released on May 10.

== Musical style and influences ==
Cave In&#x27;s music has been described as metalcore, post-hardcore, and hardcore punk. Cave In have drawn from numerous bands and genres of music. Frontman Stephen Brodsky has described Cave In&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Until Your Heart Stops&quot; as &quot;Converge worship&quot;. According to Brodsky, the Converge album &quot;Halo in a Haystack&quot; and Failure&#x27;s &quot;Magnified&quot; &quot;[define] the approach of early Cave In&quot;. Noting the latter band&#x27;s influence, Caleb Scofield once stated that &quot;You&#x27;ll hear 5,000 blatant Failure rip-offs in our stuff&quot;. Other notable influences cited by the band include Led Zeppelin, Radiohead, the Beatles, and Soundgarden.

<text>Minnesota is a state situated in the Midwestern United States. According to the 2020 United States census, Minnesota is the 22nd most populous state with inhabitants but the 14th largest by land area, spanning of land. Minnesota is divided into 87 counties and contains 853 incorporated cities, with populations ranging from 425,115 (Minneapolis) to 12 (Funkley) in 2023. Minnesota cities are classified by population as a first class city, a second class city, a third class city, or a fourth class city; this is done for legislative purposes.

<text>The Senate of Northern Ireland was the upper house of the Parliament of Northern Ireland created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It was abolished with the passing of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.

==Powers==
In practice the Senate of Northern Ireland possessed little power and even less influence. While intended as a revising chamber, in practice, debates and votes typically simply replicated those in the Commons.

==Location==
From 1932, when the building was completed, until 1972, the Senate of Northern Ireland met in the Senate Chamber of Parliament Buildings in Stormont on the eastern outskirts of Belfast. To make parallels with the British House of Lords, members of the Senate sat on red benches.

==Senators==

The Senate consisted of 26 members. Twenty-four members elected by the House of Commons of Northern Ireland using the Single Transferable Vote (STV), elected in blocks of twelve with each senator&#x27;s term lasting for two parliaments (i.e. two terms of the House of Commons) and two &quot;ex-officio&quot; members: the Lord Mayor of Belfast and Mayor of Londonderry. Convention held that, in the event of a by-election, only members of the Commons from the same county would vote on their replacement. The election system was maintained even after the abolition of STV for the House of Commons.

In 1925, at the end of the first parliament, the senators to retire were selected by lot. At the subsequent election, voting papers from the Nationalist MPs and George Henderson were deemed to have been submitted late, and were not considered. All these members had given a high preference to the Nationalist candidate, Vincent Devoto, and a subsequent analysis of the transfers showed that these would otherwise have been sufficient to elect him.

===Office-holders===
The key offices in the Senate were:

* Speaker
* 2 Deputy Speakers 
* Leader of the House
* Deputy Leader of the House (abolished in 1961).

===Political composition===

During its history 142 people sat in the upper house. With the addition of the Unionist Lord Mayor of Belfast Corporation and Mayor of Londonderry Corporation, together with boycotts of the Commons at various times by nationalist parties and fragmentation of the opposition into some parties too small to elect a Senator alone, the upper house proved to be even more heavily Unionist than the lower house. However a Nationalist, Thomas Stanislaus McAllister, served two periods as deputy speaker.

The table below shows the political composition of the twenty-four elected members of the Senate, after each election. It does not show subsequent changes of party allegiance, nor changes resulting from by-elections. Following the 1969 election, there was one vacant seat. Other than Hugh O&#x27;Doherty, Mayor of Londonderry until 1923, all the ex officio members were Ulster Unionists.

===Peerages===
Peers of the Realm were disproportionately represented in the Senate. Nine senators were or became peers of the realm at the time of their membership of the Senate. These were the third and fourth Dukes of Abercorn, Viscount Bangor, Viscount Charlemont, the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, Lord Glentoran, the Marquess of Londonderry, Lord Massereene and Ferrard, and Lord Pirrie. Lord Bangor and Lord Charlemont held Irish titles only; Lord Charlemont had been elected as an Irish representative peer and so sat in the House of Lords, Lord Bangor however did not. At least another three senators subsequently became peers by different routes. Lord Robert Grosvenor inherited the title of Duke of Westminster from his brother, Sir Basil Brooke was created Viscount Brookeborough and Victor Cooke was created a life peer as Baron Cooke of Islandreagh.

==Abolition==

The Senate, along with the House of Commons, was prorogued by the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972, and abolished completely by the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. The old Senate Chamber is now used as a committee room of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

<text>The House of Commons of Northern Ireland was the lower house of the Parliament of Northern Ireland created under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The upper house in the bicameral parliament was called the Senate. It was abolished with the passing of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.

==Membership==
The House of Commons had a membership of 52. Until 1969, 48 were from territorial constituencies and 4 were for graduates of The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast; in that year the QUB seats were abolished and four extra territorial constituencies created on the outskirts of Belfast, where the population had grown. For the electoral constituencies used, see Northern Ireland Parliament constituencies.

==Functions==
The House of Commons fulfilled the normal lower house functions to be found in the Westminster System of Government. Its roles were

* to grant Supply to the Government;
* to grant to or withdraw confidence from the Government;
* to provide a talent bank from which members of the Government could be chosen. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland was chosen from its ranks by the Governor of Northern Ireland.

==Electoral system==
The Government of Ireland Act required that elections to the House of Commons be by the single transferable vote (STV) electoral system first introduced in Ireland by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1919. Its inclusion in the 1920 Government of Ireland Act was deliberate. It was intended to provide electoral opportunities for non-Unionists. (A similar legal requirement had been set for Northern Ireland&#x27;s sister state, the non-operative Southern Ireland, and also existed in the Irish Free State.)

Under the Act the Parliament of Northern Ireland was given the legislative power to alter the electoral system from three years after its first meeting. The use of STV was criticised strongly among the grassroots of the governing Ulster Unionist Party, who viewed it as &quot;un-British&quot; (apart from four university constituencies, the rest of the United Kingdom used first past the post). The loss of eight seats by the UUP in the second parliamentary election caused a major row within the party. Rather than deal with questions as to why it faced declining popularity the party replaced STV by the non-proportional (and so less helpful to minorities) first past the post. However STV was retained for the election of the four MPs from Queens University.

==The Opposition==
The creation of Northern Ireland had been opposed both by many Unionists and all Nationalists, all of whom, like Unionist leader Sir Edward Carson, were opposed to the Partition of Ireland. While Unionists within Northern Ireland became reconciled to their form of home rule, Nationalists remained alienated from the structures of the state and pursued an abstentionist policy. The Nationalist Party, the main Nationalist party in Northern Ireland, which claimed descent from the pre-partition Irish Parliamentary Party, boycotted the Parliament entirely until 1925, and individual members boycotted at points thereafter. Other parties, notably the Northern Ireland Labour Party, did however take their seats. The absence of the main opposition party from parliament led to accusations of in effect &quot;one party rule&quot;.

For many years the most effective opposition came from various independent Unionists, most notably Tommy Henderson (served 1925–1953) who was famous for his near ten hour speech on the Appropriation Bill in May 1936.

==Procedure==
In most of its activities the House of Commons deliberately used the same procedure as the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster. Each Parliament opened with a King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Speech, though only King George V in 1921 gave it in person. From 1922 the Speech from the Throne was delivered by the Governor of Northern Ireland. The Governor was the Crown&#x27;s representative who formally summoned and prorogued Parliament. The Parliament emulated some of the more bizarre traditions, such as giving a first reading to the Outlawries Bill immediately after the Speech from the Throne as a token gesture of defiance of royal authority. The same sessional orders were then agreed relating to members returned for two constituencies.

Ministers spoke from a dispatch box in a chamber modelled on the British House of Commons chamber, though notably the benches and fixtures of the chamber were blue, rather than green. As at Westminster, members referred to each other in debate as &quot;the honourable Member for the (X) division&quot;. Bills, introduced either in the Senate or the House of Commons, had to pass through first reading, second reading, committee stage, and third reading in both Houses to become law. With a very strict divorce law, the Parliament was often asked to deal with private bills promoted by divorcing couples. Because of the much smaller size of the House, only one member was required to act as a teller for each side during a division and they were counted among those voting in the division. The Parliament established virtually the same parliamentary and committee structure as Westminster.

However, the minimal workload of Parliament, and the small number of bills that required passage, meant that Parliament could hold short sessions and meet for short working hours. The workload was so small that future Prime Minister Terence O&#x27;Neill later revealed that then Prime Minister Lord Brookeborough did not even have a desk in his &quot;de facto&quot; residence, Stormont House. (Stormont House was nominally the residence of the Speaker of the House of Commons, but as speakers chose to live elsewhere, Prime Ministers used it as their residence, and turned their official residence, Stormont Castle, into an office for their senior civil servants.)

==Venue==

The first assembly of the House of Commons occurred in Belfast City Hall in June 1921.
King George V gave a famed address where he called for reconciliation between Irish people and for Northern Ireland to be free of discrimination against the minority.

For its first decade, Parliament met in the Presbyterian College, close to the City Hall, while new Parliament Buildings was built in East Belfast at a place called Stormont. The foundation stone at Stormont was laid by The 3rd Duke of Abercorn, 1st Governor of Northern Ireland, in the late 1920s. However, the Wall Street crash undermined the financial viability of the building project. Plans were scaled back, with plans for a ministerial building and a court building on site being abandoned. The main building was also changed, with plans for a United States Capitol-style dome being abandoned, leaving a plainer neoclassical structure. The new Parliament Buildings was officially opened by the Prince of Wales in 1932.

The House of Commons and Senate chambers were located across the Central Hall (nowadays usually known as the Great Hall) from each other, replicating the link between the House of Commons and British House of Lords in Westminster. Between them hung a large chandelier from Windsor Castle which had been given to the King by his cousin, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, but had been put in storage during the First World War and remained so until given to Stormont.

==Fathers of the House==
The Parliament of Northern Ireland, including the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, was prorogued in 1972 and abolished completely in 1973 leaving the title of Father of the House defunct.

==The end==

Northern Ireland was dogged by allegations of Unionist misrule, and political gerrymandering at local government level, during the 1960s. At this time there was increasing demand for civil rights, voiced primarily by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, allegations of police misbehaviour by the Royal Ulster Constabulary and ultimately the outbreak of the Troubles. In 1972, using its legal powers under the Government of Ireland Act the British government prorogued (suspended) the Northern Ireland Parliament and Government initially for a year, before in 1973 abolishing it entirely with the passing of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. The Parliament last sat on 28 March 1972.

Parliament Buildings are now the seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a successor legislature.

<doc id="535419" wikidata="Q5133573" url="?curid=535419" title="Climate of Mumbai">
<text>The climate of Mumbai is tropical, with defined wet and dry seasons (Köppen: &quot;Aw/Am&quot;). The mean annual temperature is . Average annual rainfall is in Colaba, which represents South Mumbai and in Santacruz, which represents central and suburban Mumbai. The mean maximum average temperatures is about in summer and in winter, while the average minimums are in summer and in winter. The city experiences a lengthy, practically rainless dry season, and a relatively short, but extremely rainy wet season; due to the Southwest Monsoon and orographic influences from the nearby Western Ghats.These conditions effectively place Mumbai between a Tropical monsoon climate (Am) and a Tropical savannah climate (Aw), with more tilt towards the former considering annual precipitation.

==Climate data==


===Sea temperature===
==Monthly breakdown of climate==
The following is the monthly breakdown of the weather in Mumbai.

===January ===
January is the coolest month of the year for Mumbai with the mean daily minimum being 16.4 °C and the mean daily maximum being 30.1 °C. The nightly lows may vary between 13 °C and 20 °C. Chilly northern winds during the day make the city seem cooler than it is. Generally, clear skies, with some smog – especially in the early morning – are the norm. The days are dry, the nights relatively humid. January is also associated with the deciduous trees in the city shedding their leaves. 26–27 January 2008 recorded a minimum temperature of 10.2 °C, which is the lowest recorded in 45 years. The lowest recorded temperature is 7.4 °C (45.3 °F) on 22 January 1962 which was the coldest day in Mumbai. Coastal areas are relatively cooler during the day, but they are warmer at night.

===February===
The fine January weather continues for the first fortnight of February. The mean daily minimum stays at 17.3 °C and the mean daily maximum is 31.3 °C with some possibility of unseasonable showers. Smog increases. 6 February 2008 recorded a minimum temperature of 9.4 °C. Just two days later, on 8 February, the minimum temperature recorded was 8.5 °C, which was the lowest temperature Mumbai had seen since January 1962.

===March===
The month of March sees a mean minimum temp of 20.6 °C and a mean maximum temp of 32.7 °C. During the transition from dry to humid weather in mid-March, the temperature might hit 38 to 40 °C. This high, however, is due to hot dry winds from Gujarat. By mid-March the temperatures may hit 37 °C, with the lows at 24 °C. Humidity is unbearable, and smog affects the city. New leaves sprout from deciduous trees. The all-time high day temperature for March was recorded in 2018 at 41.7 °C.

===April===
The temperatures and humidity are still high. However, the cooling effect of the sea breezes makes its presence felt. The high temperature stays around 35.1 °C and daily lows are around 23.2 °C. Plants are in full bloom in April.

===May===
May is the hottest month of the year for Mumbai with the cool sea breezes providing some relief. The daily maximum hovers around 34.5 °C and the daily low is 29.1 °C.

===June===
June marks the beginning of the monsoon period in Mumbai. The beginning of the month is characterized by a continuation of the summer with increased humidity. The official date for the monsoon to hit the city is 10 June. This period is marked by thunderstorms and often windy conditions as the monsoon establishes itself over the city. Rainfall activity intensifies as the month goes on, leading into the wettest month, July. The max and min mean daily temperatures are measured at 31.9 °C/26.6 °C.

===July===

In this month the city receives the maximum amount of rain. July and August are characterized by almost non-stop rain and weeks of no sunshine. A continuous monsoon current covers the entire western coast of India during this period. Rainfall activity is less stormy and more constant with a relatively constant breeze from the West or South West. It is not uncommon for parts of the city to be waterlogged during periods of persistent heavy rain. This affects the city&#x27;s public transport system often leading to long delays. During periods of severe precipitation, the city&#x27;s commuter rail system is often suspended because of water logging and poor visibility.

The average maximum temperature for the month is around 29.8 °C with the average minimum at 25.5 °C. Average monthly rainfall is 919.9 mm in Santacruz and 768.5 mm in Colaba. The highest 24-hour rainfall in the history of Mumbai was recorded at the Santacruz observatory of the India Meteorological Department on 26 July 2005. On this day, a record 944 mm rainfall fell over the city, causing large-scale flooding, claiming several lives and causing large-scale property damage.

===August===
The weather in August is almost identical to July. Towards the latter half of the month, rainfall activity tends to lessen. The coolest days of the monsoon season are often in August. The max temperature might drop to 29.3 °C during the day and 24.5 °C at night.

===September===
In September the intensity of rainfall decreases. The monsoons officially end in the 3rd week of September. September has unsettled weather. The rainfall is short and light and is not continuous. The end of the monsoon, much like the beginning can feature heavy thunderstorms associated with the withdrawal of the monsoon current from the city and surrounding areas. The mean maximum daily temperatures reach 30.1 °C while daily mean minimum temperature stays at 24.0 °C.

===October===
In the month of October, the mean daily maximum stays at around 32.9 °C and the mean daily minimum stays at 23.1 °C making it hot during the days and relatively mild during the nights.

===November===
The temperature continues to drop slowly in the month of November with the mean daily minimum staying at 20.5 °C and the mean daily maximum staying around 33.4 °C. There are a few unseasonable showers.

===December===
The day highs hover around 32.4 °C. The nights average around 18.2 °C. Humidity is low in December.
== Climate change ==
As climate change and global warming are issues of rapidly increasing importance, the Mumbai Government launched the Mumbai Climate Action Plan to tackle climate change and extreme weather events.
== Cyclones in Mumbai ==
Sitting on the coast, Mumbai is vulnerable to cyclones, but as the cyclones in the Arabian Sea turn to the Arabian Peninsula or Gujarat, Mumbai stands less affected. Cyclones that have affected Mumbai include 1618, 1698, 1702, 1740, 1742, 1762, 1799, 1854, 1882 (Which is believed to be a hoax), 1891 1940 1948, Cyclone Phyan, Cyclone Ockhi, Cyclone Vayu, Cyclone Nisarga, and Cyclone Tauktae.

The strongest cyclone ever recorded to hit Mumbai is the 1948 Mumbai Cyclone, which hit the city on November 21, 1948. Gusts in Juhu reached 151 km/h, torrential rains lashed the city reaching 5 inches in only 24 hours. Flooding occurred due to heavy rains, the city power supply was disrupted. The cyclone left 38 people dead and 47 missing, Local transport came to a standstill 

In recent times, Cyclone Tauktae battered Mumbai, reaching gusts of 114 km/h with heavy rains. The storm was catastrophic, and flight operations at Mumbai&#x27;s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport halted for hours due to the cyclone.

<text>The multipactor effect is a phenomenon in radio-frequency (RF) amplifier vacuum tubes and waveguides, where, under certain conditions, secondary electron emission in resonance with an alternating electromagnetic field leads to exponential electron multiplication, possibly damaging and even destroying the RF device.

==Description==

The multipactor effect occurs when electrons accelerated by radio-frequency (RF) fields are self-sustained in a vacuum (or near vacuum) via an electron avalanche caused by secondary electron emission. The impact of an electron to a surface can, depending on its energy and angle, release one or more secondary electrons into the vacuum. These electrons can then be accelerated by the RF fields and impact with the same or another surface. Should the impact energies, number of electrons released, and timing of the impacts be such that a sustained multiplication of the number of electrons occurs, the phenomenon can grow exponentially and may lead to operational problems of the RF system such as damage of RF components or loss or distortion of the RF signal.

==Mechanism==
The mechanism of multipactor depends on the orientation of an RF electric field with respect to the surface as well as the magnetic field and its orientation. There are two types of multipactor: two-surface multipactor on metals and single-surface multipactor on metal or dielectrics.

===Two-surface multipactor on metals===
This is a multipactor effect that occurs in the gap between metallic electrodes. Often, an RF electric field is normal to the surface. A resonance between electron flight time and RF field cycle is a mechanism for multipactor development.

The existence of multipactor is dependent on the following three conditions being met: The average number of electrons released is greater than or equal to one per incident electron (this is dependent on the secondary electron yield of the surface), &quot;and&quot; the time taken by the electron to travel from the surface from which it was released to the surface it impacts is an integer multiple of one half of the RF period, &quot;and&quot; the average secondary electron yield is greater than or equal to one.

===Single-surface multipactor===
The multipactor effect can take place on a single surface when magnetic fields are taken into account. A single-surface multipactor event is also possible on a metallic surface in the presence of a crossed static magnetic field. It may also occur on a dielectric surface, where often an RF electric field is parallel to the surface. The positive charge accumulated on the dielectric surface attracts electrons back to the surface.

==Frequency-gap product in two-surface multipactor==
The conditions under which multipactor will occur in two surface multipactor can be described by a quantity called the frequency-gap product. Consider a two surface setup with the following definitions:
:formula_1, distance or gap between the surfaces 
:formula_2, angular frequency of the RF field
:formula_3, peak plate-to-plate RF voltage
:formula_4, peak electric field between the surfaces, equal to formula_5/formula_6.

The RF voltage varies sinusoidally. Consider the time at which the voltage at electrode A passes through 0 and starts to become negative. Assuming that there is at least 1 free electron near A, that electron will begin to accelerate to the right toward electrode B. It will continue to accelerate and reach a maximum velocity half a cycle later, just as the voltage at electrode B begins to become negative. If the electron(s) from electrode A strike electrode B at this time and produce additional free electrons, these new free electrons will begin to accelerate toward electrode A. The process may then repeat causing multipactor. We now find the relationship between the plate spacing, RF frequency, and RF voltage that causes the strongest multipactor resonance.

Consider a point in time at which electrons have just collided with electrode A at position -d/2. The electric field is at zero and is beginning to point to the left so that the newly freed electrons are accelerated toward the right. Newton&#x27;s equation of motion of the free electrons is
:formula_7
:formula_8

The solution to this differential equation is
:formula_9
where it is assumed that when the electrons initially leave the electrode they have zero velocity. We know that resonance happens if the electrons arrive at the rightmost electrode after one half of the period of the RF field, formula_10. Plugging this into our solution for formula_11 we get
:formula_12
:formula_13

Rearranging and using the frequency formula_14 instead of the angular frequency gives
:formula_15.

The product formula_16 is called the frequency-gap product. Keep in mind that this equation is a criterion for greatest amount of resonance, but multipactor can still occur when this equation is not satisfied.

==Effects of geometry==
Multipacting depends on the geometry of the surface and the exact distribution of the electric and magnetic fields. There are a number of geometry-based techniques to reduce or even eliminate the multipactor effect: One is through small-scale grooves which modify the direction of the electric fields exactly at the location of the electron emission, thereby kicking some of the electrons to directions that do not support the process. Another approach is through large scale corrugations of the surface which periodically alter the time of flight of the electrons in two-point multipacting, thereby disrupting the multipactor resonance condition Then there are specific changes in the curvature of a cavity&#x27;s surface that spoil the chances of the electrons to return to the point of origin or cavity-beam pipe transition surface. These various surface modifications techniques provide a powerful tool for the suppression of multipacting in various geometries.

==History==
This phenomenon was first observed by the French physicist Camille Gutton, in 1924, at Nancy.

Multipactor was identified and studied in 1934 by Philo Farnsworth, the inventor of electronic television, who attempted to take advantage of it as an amplifier. More commonly nowadays, it has become an obstacle to be avoided for normal operation of particle accelerators, vacuum electronics, radars, satellite communication devices, and so forth.

The first application of computers to investigate multipacting is from the early 1970s&lt;ref /name=Ben&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; when it was discovered as a major SRF cavity performance limitation.

A novel form of multipactor has been proposed, and subsequently experimentally observed, in which charging of a dielectric surface considerably changes the dynamics of the multipactor discharge.

<doc id="535424" wikidata="Q4204906" url="?curid=535424" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Australia">
<text>This is an overview of the postage stamps and postal history of Australia, encompassing some history of the Australian colonies and the main stamp issues that followed their federation in 1901, as well as later issues, and also a precis of the stamps of the external territories.

==Federation==

The six self-governing Australian colonies that formed the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901 had operated their own postal service and issued their own stamps – see articles on the systems on New South Wales (first stamps issued 1850), Victoria (1850), Tasmania (1853), Western Australia (1854), South Australia (1855) and Queensland (1860). Section 51(v) of the Australian Constitution empowered the Commonwealth to make laws in respect of &quot;postal, telegraphic, telephonic, and other like services&quot;.

The Commonwealth created the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department on 1 March 1901, which took over all the colonial mail systems and the then-current colony stamps. Those stamps continued to be valid, becoming de facto Commonwealth stamps. Some of them continued to be used for some time following the introduction of the Commonwealth&#x27;s uniform postage stamp series in 1913. They continued to be valid for postage until 14 February 1966 when the introduction of decimal currency invalidated all stamps bearing the earlier currency.

Circumstances precluded the immediate issue of a uniform Commonwealth postage stamp. But there was no hindrance in respect to a Postage Due series. The first of these, the design of which was based on the current New South Wales postage due stamps, was issued in July 1902.

Postal rates became uniform between the new states on 1 May 1911 because of the extension of the United Kingdom domestic postal rate of 1d per half ounce (Imperial Penny Post) to Australia as a member of the British Empire. One penny became the uniform domestic postage rate. One penny postcards and lettercards also appeared in 1911. In the same year, the Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department held a stamp design competition for a uniform series of Commonwealth postage stamps. This competition attracted over one thousand entries.

==The &quot;Roo&quot; stamp==

The first definitive stamp inscribed &quot;Australia&quot; was a red 1d &quot;Kangaroo and Map&quot; stamp, the design of which was adopted in part from the entry that won the Stamp Design Competition. Although the delay between federation and the first Australian stamps had several causes, one of the major reasons was political wrangling regarding the design. There was significant opposition to any inclusion of British royal symbols or profiles.

A design completion was announced in 1911, and several designs were chosen, including those with the monarch&#x27;s profile. The government decided to have only one design, and Charlie Frazer, then postmaster-general, inspired the basic features of the new design. Blamire Young, a local watercolour artist, was commissioned to produce the final design.

The first definitive series, issued on 2 January 1913, comprised fifteen stamps, ranging in value from ½d to £2. The Kangaroo and Map design was ordered by the Fisher Labor Government, which included a number of republicans who strenuously opposed the incorporation of the monarch&#x27;s profile on Australian stamps. One of the first acts of the Cook Liberal Government, sworn in on 14 June 1913, was to order a series of postage stamps with the profile of George V. On 8 December 1913, the first of those, an engraved 1d carmine-red, appeared. Soon after, typographed values of the design appeared, ranging from ½d (halfpenny) to 1/4d (one shilling and four pence). The Postmaster-General&#x27;s Department kept both basic designs on issue for some time – 38 years for the Kangaroo and Map design, and 23 years for the George V (until his death).

In about 1948, H. Dormer Legge published his study of the stamps: &quot;The Kangaroo Issues of the stamps of the Commonwealth of Australia&quot;.

==Later definitive stamps==
With the accession of George VI in 1936, until the early 1970s, Australian definitives featured the monarch, Australian fauna and Australian flora. However, particularly in the late 1950s, the depiction of the monarch on Australian definitives became confined to the base domestic letter rate and the preceding minor values. With the introduction of decimal currency on 14 February 1966, 24 new definitives were issued – the monarch was featured on the minor values (1c to 3c) and on the base domestic letter rate (4c) and the remainder featured Australian birds, Australian marine life, and early Australian maritime explorers. A feature of this issue was that where there was a direct conversion of value, the design was changed to reflect the new decimal currency value – for example, the 2/6d (two shilling and sixpence) Scarlet Robin definitive (issued 21 April 1965) become the new 25c decimal currency value; likewise the £2 (two pounds) Phillip Parker King definitive (issued 26 August 1964) became the new $4 decimal currency value.

The last base domestic letter rate definitive stamp featuring the monarch appeared on 1 October 1971. Since then, the designs of all Australian definitive values have focused on fauna, flora, reptiles, butterflies, marine life, gemstones, paintings, handicrafts, visual arts, community and the like. Due to complaints by royalists about the dropping of the monarch, a stamp has been issued annually since 1980 to commemorate the monarch&#x27;s birthday.

Since the 1990s, the increasing commercial focus of Australia Post has led to the design of stamps being more focused on the demands of the commercial market, rather than as a government endorsed view of the national identity. Generally stamps have avoided subjects of contemporary political controversy, although in 2019 a stamp commemorating the legalisation of same-sex marriage (following a national postal survey) was released.

==First commemorative stamp==
Australia&#x27;s first commemorative stamp was issued on 9 May 1927 to mark the opening of the first Parliament House in Canberra. Subsequently, issues have appeared regularly commemorating Australian achievements and landmarks in Australian history. The first Australian multicoloured stamps appeared on 31 October 1956 as part of the Melbourne Olympic Games commemorative issue. These were printed by a foreign company. The first Australian-printed multicoloured stamp, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Australian Inland Mission, was issued on 5 September 1962.
There have been many special issues. The first Christmas stamp appeared on 6 November 1957. In recent years, designs for the Christmas issue have alternated each year between the religious and the secular. From 1993, in October of every year, Australia Post has commemorated Stamp Collecting month with special issues, typically featuring topics that are of interest to children such as pets, native fauna and space. Commencing with the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, during the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, stamps featuring Australians who have won an Olympic gold medal are issued on the next postal business day after the achievement.

==Airmails==
Australia&#x27;s first airmail-designated stamp appeared on 20 May 1929. A special 3d (three pence) airmail stamp was available for mail sent on the Perth-Adelaide air service. The cost of this service was 3d per ½ oz plus normal postage. On 19 March 1931 and 4 November 1931, a further two airmail-designated stamps, both 6d (sixpence), appeared. After these, general definitives were used for mail sent by air.

==Stamp booklets==
Coin-operated vending machines were introduced in 1960 and have continued in various forms to the present day. These included Frama vending machines stamps, first issued in 1984 and discontinued in 2003, as well as various booklets. Booklet stamps were discontinued in 1973 but were reintroduced some years later. Stamp booklets were available from Advance Bank ATMs from 1984 until the bank&#x27;s merger with St George Bank in 1996. These were Australia&#x27;s first (and, to date, only) triangular stamp issue.

==Self-adhesive stamps==
Self-adhesive stamps were first issued in 1990. The first self-adhesive commemoratives appeared in 1993. Self-adhesive stamps have proved popular with users and very soon came to be in more common use than gummed stamps. Australia issues gummed versions of all self-adhesive stamps.

Prior to 1997, the official policy of Australia Post was to not depict living persons on stamps other than members of the royal family. However, in 1950 Anmatyerre man Gwoya Tjungurrayi became the first living Australian depicted on a stamp. Presumably, the rule was not taken into consideration as the stamp was intended to depict a generic image of an Aboriginal person. Since 1997, Australia Post has formally adjusted its policy and has issued stamps commemorating living Australians. In particular, an annual Australian Legends issue has commemorated living Australians who have made some significant contribution during their lives, with Sir Donald Bradman being the first depicted.

Stamps with personalized tabs were introduced in 1999. Australia Post has also used tabs to commemorate themes and individuals not considered significant enough for a stamp issue of their own.

==Postal rates==
Since the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax, separate stamps were introduced for domestic and international postage in 2001. Stamps inscribed &quot;International Post&quot; are not valid for domestic postage. Domestic stamps can be used for overseas postage but contribute less than face value towards the postage (the user must deduct the tax component).

==Official Service stamps==
From the 1913 to 1930, Commonwealth and State Government agencies used stamps (perfins) punctured with OS (&quot;Official Service&quot;). In 1931 the puncturing system was abandoned and stamps for government mail were overprinted OS. In February 1933, it was decided that government mail would no longer require postage stamps. The exception to OS stamps being restricted for the use of government agencies was the 4 November 1931 6d airmail stamp. The OS overprinted stamp was sold over post office counters to prevent speculation and was valid for all types of mail.

==Joint issues==
Australia has had joint stamp issues with New Zealand (1958, 1963 and 1988), the United Kingdom (1963, 1988 and 2005), some of its external territories (1965), the United States of America (1988), the U.S.S.R. (1990), People&#x27;s Republic of China (1995), Germany (1996), Indonesia (1996), Singapore (1998), Greece (2000), Hong Kong (2001), Sweden (2001), France (2002) and Thailand (2002).

==Postal stationery==
Postal stationery was first issued by the Commonwealth of Australia in April 1911. Postcards based on the design of South Australia 1893 postcards and a &quot;Stamp&quot; design of a full face of King George V, engraved by Samuel Reading, were issued in April 1911. Letter Cards with the same &quot;Stamp&quot; design were also issued. Envelopes, Registered envelopes and Newspaper wrappers were first issued in 1913, using the &quot;Kangaroo on Map&quot; &quot;Stamp&quot; design by Blamire Young. Aerogrammes were first issued in 1944.

==External territories==

Each Australian external territory has a specific postal and philatelic history.

Formerly administered by New South Wales, Norfolk Island used that colony&#x27;s stamps after 1877. Norfolk Island used stamps of Australia between 1913 and 1947, attained postal independence and issued its own stamps on 10 June 1947. Norfolk Island lost postal independence in 2016.

The Territory of Papua, officially a British colony but administered by Australia, issued its own stamps from 1901. before this, it had used Queensland stamps. Stamps of Australia were issued there between 1945 and 1953 in the new Territory of Papua and New Guinea.

Transferred from Singapore to Australia by the United Kingdom in the 1950s, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands were progressively and separately integrated into the Australian postal system and losing their postal and philatelic independence in the 1990s. While Christmas Island had postal independence and issued its own stamps since 1958, the Cocos Islands used stamps of Australia from 1952 until its postal independence in 1979. The first Cocos stamps were issued in 1963.

Both territories lost their postal independence to Australia Post in 1993 for Christmas Island and 1994 for the Cocos Islands. Consequently, their stamps became valid within Australia and stamps of Australia became valid in the islands.

The Australian Antarctic Territory had always been using stamps of Australia but disposed of its stamps since 27 March 1957. They are valid for postage within Australia.

==Military occupations and mandates==
With military operations during World War I, Australia occupied two former German colonies, German New Guinea and Nauru. German colonial stamps were overprinted, followed by Australian stamps overprinted &quot;North West Pacific Islands&quot; in 1915. In the 1920s, stamps were issued for these two territories as League of Nations mandates.

Nauru and New Guinea were under Japanese occupation in 1942. At the end of World War II, in 1945, stamps of Australia were used in mandate of New Guinea and in Papua until 1 March 1953. The new combined Territory of Papua and New Guinea received its own stamps bearing the name &quot;Territory of Papua and New Guinea&quot; until its independence in 1975.

===British Commonwealth Occupation Force===

Between October 1946 and February 1949, in occupied Japan, the Australian stamps used as such by the military post offices were overprinted &quot;B.C.O.F. / JAPAN / 1946&quot; to avoid speculation on the currency value.

<doc id="535429" wikidata="Q3360801" url="?curid=535429" title="Liberal Party (UK, 1989)">
<text>The Liberal Party is a liberal political party in the United Kingdom that was founded in 1989 as a continuation of the original Liberal Party (founded in 1859) by members who opposed its merger with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to form the Liberal Democrats. The party holds six local council seats. The party promotes a hybrid of both classical and social liberal tendencies.

== History ==
The original Liberal Party entered into an alliance with the Social Democratic Party in 1981 and merged with it in 1988 to form what became the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Party, founded in 1859, was descended from the Whigs, Radicals, Irish Independent Party and Peelites, while the SDP was a party created in 1981 by former Labour members, MPs and cabinet ministers, but which also gained defections from Conservatives.

A small minority of the Liberal Party, notably including the former Member of Parliament (MP) Michael Meadowcroft (the last elected president of the Liberal Party), resolved to continue with the Liberal Party. They continued using the old party name and symbols, including the party anthem, &quot;The Land&quot;. Meadowcroft announced this reformation after the defeat of the traditional liberal Alan Beith to become party leader of the Liberal Democrats, although Beith himself stayed with the latter.

The continuing Liberal Party included several councillors and council groups from the pre-1988 party which had never joined the merged party and continued as Liberals (hence the disputed foundation date), but no MPs. Since then, the number of Liberal district councillors has gradually declined. However, as a result of a number of community-based politicians, defections and recruitment the party has an increased number of town and parish councillors. The party has had its greatest success in elections to Liverpool City Council. Its leadership largely comes from the Liverpool area and the party is primarily based in North Yorkshire.

Meadowcroft stepped down from the party presidency in 2002, and was replaced by Councillor Steve Radford. In 2007, Meadowcroft left the party and joined the Liberal Democrats. Radford stood down in 2009, and was replaced as president of the party by former councillor Rob Wheway, who served a year as leader. Radford was re-elected party president in 2010, and has been elected for further terms by members in ballot at assemblies and by electronic voting.

Party members take part in Liberal International (LI) activities through the Liberal International British Group.

=== Europe ===
The 1989 reformed party initially continued the Liberal Party&#x27;s support for European integration but, unlike the Liberal Democrats, they came to oppose the Single European currency and the Maastricht Treaty, the latter of which was seen as disempowering the European Parliament. In the 1997 general election, they advocated turning the European Union into a &quot;Commonwealth of Europe&quot;, which would include all European countries and focus on peace and the environment, rather than on economic issues. In Meadowcroft&#x27;s book for this election, he advocated joining the Schengen agreement, an idea which did not appear in the party&#x27;s manifesto. The Party in this period also opposed referendums with the line &quot;It is dangerous to pretend that issues can be settled by a simple question with a yes or no answer&quot;, and instead preferred citizens&#x27; juries. After Radford replaced Meadowcroft as party leader, the Liberal Party became increasingly Eurosceptic.

The party put up a full slate of candidates in the North West England region for the 2004 European Parliament election, coming seventh with 4.6% of the vote (0.6% of the total British popular vote).

In the 2009 European Parliament election, the Liberal Party&#x27;s Steve Radford participated in the No2EU electoral alliance.

In the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum campaign, the party let candidates express their own views, but both the National Executive and many party members supported Leave. As the party had a long-standing opposition to the use of referendums, they released a statement that ceding sovereignty was an exception to this principle, and that the Lisbon and Maastricht Treaties should have been subjected to referendums on transferring power to the European Union.

Following the referendum, the party argued that the country should leave the EU in its manifestos for the 2017 and 2019 general elections.

== Ideology ==
The Liberal Party refers to its ideology as a &quot;hybrid&quot; of classical liberalism and social liberalism, and claims that the Liberal Democrats have shown contempt for &quot;liberal principles&quot;, the &quot;British people&quot; and the &quot;democratic process&quot;.

== Electoral performance ==
In the 2011 local council elections, eight Liberal councillors held their seats, three lost their seats and five new Liberal councillors were elected: a net gain of two. In the two years leading to the May 2013 local elections, the number of Liberal councillors rose from 16 to 21.

Cllr Steve Radford received 4,442 (4.5%) of the votes in the first round of the Mayor of Liverpool 2012 election.
In the 2012 United Kingdom local elections there was a net loss of six seats, in the 2013 elections the party won three seats, a gain of one.

Although the Liberal Party has retained councillors in Ryedale and Liverpool, it has not had a significant impact. However, Liberal member John Clark served as chair of Ryedale District Council&#x27;s policy and resources committee, making him &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the council, from March 2021 until his death that August. 

In 2014, the Liberal Party held 21 council seats at county and district level and 15 seats at community level. The party has no representation in the UK Parliament or Scottish Parliament, nor did it ever have Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). At the 2001 UK general election the party&#x27;s best local result was coming second behind Labour in Liverpool West Derby, pushing the Liberal Democrats into third place. However, it was unable to repeat this at the 2005 general election; it finished third behind the Liberal Democrats in the constituency, still beating the Conservative Party, and repeated this position at the 2010 general election. In the 2015 general election the Liberal Party came fourth narrowly holding its deposit, ahead of the Liberal Democrats (who came last) and the Green Party, but behind UKIP and the Conservative Party.

At the 2015 general election, the Liberal Party in Cornwall decided to not contest any seats and urged its supporters to vote for UKIP. At the 2017 general election, the party contested four seats and received 3,672 votes.

In the 2019 general election, the party contested nineteen seats and received 10,562 votes.

At the 2021 local election, the party appears not to have won any new seats. A seat was retained on Liverpool City Council. The party lost its last remaining unitary authority seat when Chris Ash of Dogsthorpe Ward of Peterborough City Council retired and no Liberal candidate stood. In the 2021 Mayor of Liverpool election the party&#x27;s candidate Steve Radford received 7,135 votes (7%).

In the 2024 general election, the party contested 12 seats and received 6,375 votes.

== Elected members ==
The Liberal Party has never had any members in the Houses of Parliament, the Welsh Parliament, the European Parliament or the Northern Ireland and London Assemblies.

=== Unitary councillors ===
* Liverpool (3) representing the wards of Tuebrook Breckside, Tuebrook Larkhill, and Stoneycroft.
*North Yorkshire (1) representing the Pickering division.

=== District councillors ===
*East Devon (1) Honiton St Michael&#x27;s ward.

=== Parish councillors ===
In 2023, the party had 11 councillors on parish, town and community councils in Staffordshire, Cornwall, Gloucestershire and Lincolnshire.

=== Number of councillors ===
Totals include any in-year by-elections and defections, held/gain/loss are the changes since the start of the last municipal year. Figure from the BBC election results before 2003 lists Liberal Party seats amongst &quot;Others&quot; or &quot;Independents&quot;.

== Controversy ==
In May 2021, the party&#x27;s only candidate at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Derek Jackson in the Glasgow Southside constituency, was escorted from the count after arriving wearing rainbow arm-bands, yellow Star of David-style stars, and harassing Humza Yousaf, a candidate in the nearby Pollok constituency. Upon ejection from the count, the candidate and his supporters were photographed appearing to give Nazi salutes. The Liberal Party immediately suspended Jackson and issued a statement distancing itself from his comments and actions and apologising for any offence he may have caused; Jackson was expelled from the party on 9 May.

<doc id="535434" wikidata="Q128701" url="?curid=535434" title="Urraca of León and Castile">
<text>Urraca (León, 24 June 1081 – Saldaña, 8 March 1126), called &quot;the reckless&quot; &quot;(la temeraria)&quot;, was Queen of León, Castile and Galicia from 1109 until her death. She claimed the imperial title as suo jure &quot;Empress of All Spain&quot; and &quot;Empress of All Galicia&quot;. She is considered to be the first European queen to reign in her own right.

== Early years ==

Urraca was born to King Alfonso VI of León and Castile and his second wife, Constance of Burgundy. Constance was closely related to the French royal family and the influential Burgundian abbot Hugh of Cluny was her maternal uncle. As Constance was also related to her husband&#x27;s first wife, Agnes of Aquitaine, Pope Gregory VII only confirmed their marriage after Alfonso agreed to replace the traditional Mozarabic liturgy in his realms with the Roman Rite. The place and date of Urraca&#x27;s birth are unknown, but she was born likely in Sahagún or León around 1080, probably in 1081. Although she was her parents&#x27; sole child, her childhood is poorly documented. She mentioned Presbyter Pedro and Domingo Falcóniz, two otherwise unknown clergymen, as her tutors in her royal diplomas. Her relationship with her paternal aunt Elvira was obviously close, as it is demonstrated by Elvira&#x27;s appointment as guardian of Urraca&#x27;s daughter Sancha Raimúndez. A late source, Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, claims that the powerful aristocrat Pedro Ansúrez and his wife Elo Alfónsez raised Urraca in their household, but no contemporaneous document confirms this report.

== First marriage and widowhood ==

Urraca was married to Raymond of Burgundy. Unlike her mother, who was a member of the ruling house of the Duchy of Burgundy, her husband descended from the rulers of the neighbouring County of Burgundy. Raymond was also the brother-in-law of Urraca&#x27;s maternal cousin Duke Odo I of Burgundy and Odo&#x27;s brother Henry. The Muslim Almoravids inflicted a heavy defeat on Alfonso VI at Sagrajas in 1086 and Urraca&#x27;s marriage to Raymond was part of Alfonso&#x27;s diplomatic strategy to attract cross-Pyrenees alliances. The first authentic document mentioning Urraca as Raymond&#x27;s wife, a letter of grant to one Hermenegildo Rodríguez, was issued on 22 February 1093, but interpolated documents refer to them as husband and wife already before 1088. Historians Ángel Gordo Molina and Diego Melo Carrasco propose that Raymond wed Urraca likely before early 1090 when royal diplomas first present them as rulers of the &quot;Land of Saint James&quot;, or Galicia.

Raymond reached the age of majority by the time of the marriage, but Alfonso VI continued to control the administration of Galicia. His representative in Galicia, Pedro Vimaraz, died around the time of the wedding and Alfonso appointed Arias Diaz as his successor. A talented young clergyman, Diego Gelmírez, was made the &quot;chancellor and secretary&quot; of Raymond and Urraca with Alfonso&#x27;s consent. On the other hand, Raymond and Urraca became involved in the administration of other provinces as well. For instance, they witnessed charters on the occasion of the repopulation of Ávila, Segovia, Salamanca and Zamora. In 1093 Urraca&#x27;s mother died and Alfonso&#x27;s Moorish concubine Zaida of Seville gave birth to a son, Sancho Alfónsez. The birth of her illegitimate brother jeopardized Urraca&#x27;s position as their father&#x27;s sole heir. The power base of Raymond and Urraca weakened even more when Alfonso granted the &quot;Land of Portugal&quot; to his illegitimate daughter Theresa and her husband Henry of Burgundy around 1094.

As a woman, Urraca was under the tutelage of her husband. Raymond was mentioned at the first place in almost all documents issued during his rule as Count of Galicia. Two documents, both confirming privileges of the burghers of Santiago de Compostella, referred to her as &quot;Queen Urraca&quot; in 1095 and 1105. The use of the title may have expressed her resentment at her inferior position, although , or royal princesses, were occasionally styled queens in this period. Sancho Alfónsez was regularly mentioned in royal diplomas from 1103, showing that Alfonso VI regarded his only son as his heir, although most clerics opposed the succession of an illegitimate child. By March 1107, Sancho was elected king on his father&#x27;s initiative. Raymond made preparations for a succession crisis through an alliance with their brother-in-law Henry of Portugal. Their treaty was confirmed in the presence of a high-ranking monk from the Abbey of Cluny late in 1105 or early in 1106. They agreed on the division of their father-in-law&#x27;s realms without referring to Sancho&#x27;s claims and Henry promised to rule his portion as Raymond&#x27;s vassal.

Raymond fell seriously ill and died in Grajal de Campos in September 1107. The widowed Urraca took full responsibility of the administration of Galicia. She styled herself &quot;empress of whole Galicia&quot; in her letter of grant to the Lugo Cathedral late in 1107 or early in 1108. The Galician clerics and aristocrats regarded Urraca&#x27;s infant son by Raymond, Alfonso Raimúndez, as Raymond&#x27;s lawful successor. The boy&#x27;s position as his father&#x27;s heir was confirmed in their presence at an assembly in León by Alfonso VI. The King also acknowledged his grandson&#x27;s right to rule Galicia in case of Urraca&#x27;s remarriage. Around this time Urraca began a love affair with the Castilian aristocrat Gómez González. Sancho Alfónsez died fighting against the Almoravids at Uclés on 29 May 1108. After her half-brother&#x27;s unexpected death, Urraca became their father&#x27;s sole heir. Her new position was ceremoniously confirmed at an assembly of &quot;almost all nobles and counts of Spain&quot; shortly before her father died on 30 June or 1 July 1108.

==Reign==

===Second marriage===
Urraca succeeded her father as the first queen regnant in European history. Her earliest extant diploma, issued in favour of the León Cathedral a day after her father&#x27;s funeral, referred to her as &quot;queen of whole Spain&quot;. Prominent Leonese, Castilian and Galician aristocrats and twelve bishops witnessed the document, showing that her realm&#x27;s elite acknowledged her as lawful monarch. Two early sources—the &quot;Chronicle of Sahagún&quot; and the —attribute the proposal about Urraca&#x27;s marriage to Alfonso I, King of Aragon and Navarre, to the Leonese aristocrats. They were reportedly convinced that a female monarch would be unable to rule and defend the kingdom against the Almoravids and forced Urraca to marry to &quot;the bloodthirsty and cruel Aragonese tyrant&quot; against her will. Bernard of Sédirac, Archbishop of Toledo, raised objections against the marriage, emphasising that Urraca and Alfonso were cousins. In contrast with the two chronicles, Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada writes that Alfonso VI started the negotiations about his heir&#x27;s marriage with Alfonso I because he wanted to prevent Urraca&#x27;s marriage with her lover, Gómez González. Gordo Molina and Melo Carrasc propose that both reports could be reliable, because the selection of a suitable husband for his daughter and heir was the elderly King&#x27;s most important task before his death.

Alfonso I married Urraca in the castle of Monzón in October or November 1109. In December, Urraca granted her &quot;whole land that used to be&quot; her father&#x27;s to her husband whom she mentioned as &quot;lord and my spouse&quot;. In the same document, she stipulated that Alfonso should respect her &quot;like a good husband his good wife&quot; and he could not request the annulment of their marriage referring to their kinship or excommunication. The document confirmed the right of Urraca&#x27;s son by her first marriage to inherit León in case the couple died without issue. The Galician aristocrats&#x27; traditional desire for independence awakened and they used the defense of Alfonso Raimúndez&#x27;s right to rule Galicia and succeed his mother as a pretext for a rebellion. After their leader Pedro Fróilaz de Traba announced that Urraca had lost her claim to rule Galicia when remarrying, they proclaimed Alfonso Raimúndez king. Pedro Arias, Pedro Gudestéiz and other Galician nobles who remained loyal to Urraca formed a brotherhood against Pedro Fróilaz and his allies. They offered the leadership to Diego Gelmírez, who had been elevated to Bishop of Compostella, but Gelmírez remained neutral in the conflict. Alfonso I and Urraca invaded Galicia and seized the important castle of Monterroso, but reports of the cruelty of the Aragonese troops outraged the Leonese aristocrats. The relationship between Alfonso I and the high clergy grew tense. The bishop of Palencia was imprisoned, the archbishop of Toledo, the bishops of Burgos and León and the abad of Sahagún were forced to flee.

The marriage proved unfortunate. Alfonso&#x27;s prejudice against women is well documented and he disliked Urraca&#x27;s son. She disdained her husband for his superstitious nature, in particular for his fear of ravens and crows, and he killed a Galician noble who had sought Urraca&#x27;s protection in Monterroso during their campaign in Galicia. Her husband regularly shamed her in the royal court and often went as far as beating and kicking her in public. Urraca&#x27;s letter of grant to the Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos is the earliest attestation to her will to get rid of her husband&#x27;s tutelage. In the document, she styled herself as &quot;queen of whole Spain and daughter of Emperor Alfonso&quot; on 13 June 1110. The exact circumstances of Urraca&#x27;s separation from her husband are uncertain. According to contemporaneous sources, she left Alfonso after consulting with her advisors. Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada writes that Alfonso repudiated her for her infidelity leaving her &quot;free to do whatever she pleased&quot;. The last document mentioning Urraca in her second husband&#x27;s company was issued on 22 May 1112.
The marriage of Urraca and Alfonso almost immediately sparked rebellions in Galicia and scheming by her illegitimate half-sister Theresa and brother-in-law Henry, the countess and count of Portugal. Also, they believed that the new marriage of Urraca could put in jeopardy the rights of the son of her first marriage, Alfonso Raimúndez. One of the first acts of the new spouses was to sign a pact under which the monarchs granted to each other &quot;soberana potestas&quot; over the other&#x27;s kingdom, declaring heir of both their future children, and in the case that the union was childless, the surviving spouse would succeed the other one in the throne.

From the start, the Galician faction was divided in two tendencies: one headed by Archbishop Diego Gelmírez of Santiago de Compostela (who defended the position of Alfonso Raimúndez as Urraca&#x27;s successor) and another led by Count Pedro Fróilaz de Traba, tutor of the young prince (who was inclined to the complete independence of Galicia under the rule of Alfonso). A third group of opposition to the royal marriage was at the court and was headed by Count Gómez González, whose motivation against Urraca and Alfonso I of Aragon could have been his fear of losing power, a sensation soon confirmed when Alfonso I appointed Aragonese and Navarrese nobles for important public posts and as holders of fortresses.

From Galicia, the count of Traba began the first aggressive movement against the monarchs reclaiming the hereditary rights of Alfonso Raimúndez. In response to the Galician rebellion, Alfonso I of Aragon marched with his army to Galicia and in 1110, reestablished the order there after defeating the local troops in Monterroso Castle. The Galician rebellion against the royal power was only the beginning of a series of political and military conflicts which, with the complete opposite personalities of Urraca and Alfonso I and their mutual dislike, gave rise to a continuous civil war in the Hispanic kingdoms over the following years. Urraca did not share the governance of her realms with her husband.

As their relationship soured, Urraca accused Alfonso of physical abuse, and by May 1110 she separated from Alfonso. In addition to her objections to Alfonso&#x27;s handling of rebels, the couple had a falling-out over his execution of one of the rebels who had surrendered to the queen, to whom the queen was inclined to be merciful. Additionally, as Urraca was married to someone many in the kingdom objected to, the queen&#x27;s son and heir became a rallying point for opponents to the marriage.
Estrangement between husband and wife escalated from discrete and simmering hostilities into open armed warfare between the Leonese-Castilians and the Aragonese. An alliance between Alfonso of Aragon and Henry of Portugal culminated in the 1111 Battle of Candespina in which Urraca&#x27;s lover and chief supporter Gómez González was killed. He was soon replaced in both roles by another count, Pedro González de Lara, who took up the fight and would father at least two further children by Urraca. By the fall of 1112 a truce was brokered between Urraca and Alfonso with their marriage annulled. Though Urraca recovered Asturias, Leon, and Galicia, Alfonso occupied a significant portion of Castile (where Urraca enjoyed large support), while her half-sister Theresa and her husband Count Henry of Portugal occupied Zamora and Extremadura. Recovering these regions and expanding into Muslim lands would occupy much of Urraca&#x27;s foreign policy. Despite the annulment of their marriage (on the grounds of consanguinity), Alfonso continued his efforts for political control. While Urraca was engaged in this battle, she also had to contend with the schemes of her sister, who promoted a plan to replace the queen by her son. This particular incident, ended in a compromise between the two sisters where Theresa was granted a vast territory in Leon in exchange for agreeing that she was Urraca&#x27;s vassal.

According to author Bernard F. Reilly, the measure of success for Urraca&#x27;s rule was her ability to restore and protect the integrity of her inheritance – that is, the kingdom of her father – and transmit that inheritance in full to her own heir. Policies and events pursued by Alfonso VI – namely legitimizing her brother and thereby providing an opportunity for her illegitimate half-sister to claim a portion of the patrimony, as well as the forced marriage with Alfonso I of Aragon – contributed in large part to the challenges Urraca faced upon her succession. Additionally, the circumstance of Urraca&#x27;s gender added a distinctive role-reversal dimension to diplomacy and politics, which Urraca used to her advantage.

== Character ==
Urraca is characterized in the &quot;Historia Compostelana&quot; as prudent, modest, and with good sense. According to Reilly, the chronicle also attributes her failings to &quot;the weakness and changeability of women, feminine perversity&quot;, and calls her a Jezebel for her liaisons with her leading magnates, with at least one relationship producing an illegitimate son. Her son Alfonso Raimúndez likewise decried the political turmoil caused by her extramarital affairs. Modern historians have given a more critical outlook to these observations, with Reilly noting that the queen was nevertheless in control of events, in contrast with earlier writers who had described her suitors as the real rulers.

== Death and legacy ==

According to the twelfth-century &quot;Chronicon Compostellanum&quot;, Urraca died in adulterous childbirth on 8 March 1126 in the castle of Saldaña. As queen, she rose to the challenges presented to her, and her solutions were seen by Reilly as pragmatic ones. Her delaying the accession of her son Alfonso VII nevertheless led to a turbulent transition of power, as the new king would have to face the rebellion of her lover Pedro González upon her death, followed by an attempted invasion by the king of Aragon, and the resumption of Galician revolts.

== Family ==

Urraca&#x27;s firstborn child by Raymond, Sancha, was born before 11 November 1095. She was named for Urraca&#x27;s paternal grandmother Sancha of León who transmitted the claim to rule the Kingdom of León to her children. A diploma issued in Monastery of San Xulián de Samos on 24 October 1102 refers to the &quot;children&quot; of Raymond and Urraca, implying that their second child, Alfonso, had been born, but two nearly contemporaneous sources—the and the —dates Alfonso&#x27;s birth to 1105. He was named for Urraca&#x27;s father.

Urraca had two illegitimate children with her lover Pedro González de Lara: Fernando Pérez Hurtado (c.1114-1156), and Elvira Pérez de Lara (c.1112-1174), who is mentioned in the &quot;Historia Compostelana&quot; in connection with her donation of the village of Arquillinos to Diego Gelmírez. Elvira would twice wed, first to García Pérez de Traba, lord of Trastámara and son of Pedro Fróilaz de Traba, then to count Beltrán de Risnel.

<text>Diadema (, &quot;Diadem&quot;) is a municipality in São Paulo state, Brazil. Belonging to the ABCD Region of Greater São Paulo, it is distant from São Paulo&#x27;s central point. Initially part of São Bernardo do Campo, Diadema became a city of its own in 1959. The population is 393,237 in an area of . The annual mean temperature in the city is . Its HDI is 0.790.

Although located in the heart of a traditionally industrial region, its main source of income is the service sector, featuring 77 healthcare installations. Diadema is home to a butterfly zoo, a botanical garden, an art museum and an observatory.

== History ==

Since its beginning, Diadema occupation process had one fundamental factor: its geographical location between the coast - Vila de São Vicente - and the plateau - Vila de São Paulo de Piratininga (São Paulo city early name). It was the existence of a connecting road between São Bernardo do Campo and Santo Amaro that provided ways for the early inhabitants to arrive to the neighborhoods in the early 18th century. The avenues that are now known as Antonio Piranga and Piraporinha were originated from this early roads.

Until the 1940s, Diadema was constituted by four neighborhoods belonging to São Bernardo do Campo: Piraporinha, Eldorado, Taboão e Vila Conceição. Dispersed, they were only connected through roads of difficult passage and each neighborhood had its own life. Piraporinha near São Bernardo; Taboão, also connected to São Bernardo do Campo due to the proximity and to São Paulo through Água Funda Avenue. Eldorado, a neighborhood that had unique characteristics, because of the Billings Reservoir, had a greater proximity to São Paulo, to the Santo Amaro region and finally Vila Conceição formed by the farms that once belonged to the Vila Conceição Company.

With the village came progress, which began in 1900 with the construction of a steam-powered sawmill owned by Antônio Piranga, son of José Pedroso. At the beginning of the 20th century, the old cattle route (Estrada da Vila Conceição) began to undergo a process of industrialization and urbanization. The steam-powered sawmill operated for twenty years (until 1920), supplying a furniture-making industry in São Bernardo do Campo.

==Education==
The municipality has several higher education facilities: a campus of the Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira, a branch of the São Paulo State Technological College, and a Serviço Nacional de Aprendizagem Industrial regional department.

Since 2009 an industrial chemistry degree was added and in 2010 a further two courses; in environmental sciences and a science licentiate degree (a combination of physics, mathematics, biology and chemistry).

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica da Borda do Campo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012. The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<text>Quicksilver Highway is a 1997 made for television comedy horror anthology film directed by Mick Garris. It is based on Clive Barker&#x27;s 1985 short story &quot;The Body Politic&quot; and Stephen King&#x27;s 1992 short story &quot;Chattery Teeth&quot;. The film was originally shown on the Fox Network on 13 May 1997, before being released on home media.

==Plot==

The main story is centered on Aaron Quicksilver (played by Christopher Lloyd), a travelling showman who tells horror stories to the people he meets. He first runs into a newly married couple who are hitchhiking, to whom he tells the story &quot;Chattery Teeth&quot;, about a man who is saved from a dangerous hitchhiker by a set of wind-up toy teeth. He later runs into a pickpocket to whom he tells &quot;The Body Politic&quot;, a story about a man whose hands rebel against him.

== Production ==
Creative Artists Agency met with Garris about him writing the pilot script for a possible horror television series directed by John McTiernan and produced by his wife, Donna Dubrow. The agency suggested multiple ghost stories and urban legends to write about, but Garris had another idea. The series would follow a mysterious character who describes himself as &quot;only a storyteller&quot; but is actually much more than that. Each episode would be set in a different location, with the same actors playing different characters. Just after Brandon Tartikoff signed on as producer, Garris pitched the idea to staff at the American Broadcasting Company; the heads of the network weren&#x27;t interested as they didn&#x27;t want any horror material in their broadcast schedule, but a couple of the network&#x27;s executives like Greer Shephard got on board. After writing a pilot script based on Stephen King&#x27;s short story &quot;Chattery Teeth,&quot; Garris pitched the series to Fox. However, Fox wanted a two-hour television film. He wrote a screenplay of Clive Barker&#x27;s &quot;The Body Politic&quot; to serve as the film&#x27;s second part after &quot;Chattery Teeth.&quot; Casting director Lynn Kressel, who previously worked with Garris on &quot;The Stand&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Shining&quot; (1997), came up with the idea of Christopher Lloyd as Quicksilver; while the network loved the decision, Garris was a bit skeptical, reasoning that he want a &quot;little more seductive&quot; actor to play the part. In the end, however, Garris loved the decision.

The moment Fox began developing the project, McTiernan left the director&#x27;s seat on the project, leaving Garris to have to direct the screenplay himself. &quot;The Body Politic&quot; was filmed at the Santa Monica Pier, while &quot;Chattery Teeth&quot; was filmed in Lancaster, California. When playing Dr. Charles George, Matt Frewer had a tough time making the hand move as if it had a separate mind; it took around three days for him to master the trick, and by the third day was having &quot;hand nightmares&quot; while resting between shoots. Steve Johnson handled the chattery teeth effects, while Flash Film Works and Bill Mesa was responsible for the moving hands. Around 90% of the hands were digitally animated with LightWave 3D and composed in the shots with the Chyron program Liberty. The more practical hand effects, such as George&#x27;s left hand, were performed by Christopher Hart, whose work as a magician got him hand-only characters in projects such as three &quot;Addams Family&quot; films. The same trick for composing Hart&#x27;s hand into the shots of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; films was used in &quot;Quicksilver Highway&quot;; Hart wore a rubber prosthetic on the top of his hand and a green sleeve, and by using green screening and footage that matched the background of the shots of Hart&#x27;s hand, his arm was removed. Four days were spent shooting Hart&#x27;s hand.

== Home media ==
The home media version of &quot;Quicksilver Highway&quot; switched the orders of the two stories from the television version, where &quot;The Body Politic&quot; comes first and &quot;Chattery Teeth&quot; last. Fox required this change, which Garris disliked as he felt &quot;The Body Politic&quot; was more climactic than &quot;Chattery Teeth.&quot;

<text>The stellar atmosphere is the outer region of the volume of a star, lying above the stellar core, radiation zone and convection zone.

==Overview==
The stellar atmosphere is divided into several regions of distinct character:

* The photosphere, which is the atmosphere&#x27;s lowest and coolest layer, is normally its only visible part. Light escaping from the surface of the star stems from this region and passes through the higher layers. The Sun&#x27;s photosphere has a temperature in the range. Starspots, cool regions of disrupted magnetic field, lie in the photosphere.
* Above the photosphere lies the chromosphere. This part of the atmosphere first cools down and then starts to heat up to about 10 times the temperature of the photosphere.
* Above the chromosphere lies the transition region, where the temperature increases rapidly on a distance of only around .
* Additionally, many stars have a molecular layer (MOLsphere) above the photosphere and just beyond or even within the chromosphere. The molecular layer is cool enough to contain molecules rather than plasma, and may consist of such components as carbon monoxide, water vapor, silicon monoxide, and titanium oxide.
* The outermost part of the stellar atmosphere, or upper stellar atmosphere, is the corona, a tenuous plasma which has a temperature above one million Kelvin. While all stars on the main sequence feature transition regions and coronae, not all evolved stars do so. It seems that only some giants, and very few supergiants, possess coronae. An unresolved problem in stellar astrophysics is how the corona can be heated to such high temperatures. The answer is believed to lie in magnetic fields, but the exact mechanism remains unclear.
* The astrosphere, which is in the case of the Sun the heliosphere, can be in a broader understanding considered the furthest part of a stellar atmosphere, before interstellar space begins at the heliopause. The astrosphere is not to be confused with the Solar System and its outermost region the Oort cloud, which extends much further than the astrosphere, therefore far into interstellar space.

During a total solar eclipse, the photosphere of the Sun is obscured, revealing its atmosphere&#x27;s other layers. Observed during eclipse, the Sun&#x27;s chromosphere appears (briefly) as a thin pinkish arc, and its corona is seen as a tufted halo. The same phenomenon in eclipsing binaries can make the chromosphere of giant stars visible.

<doc id="535476" wikidata="Q17009299" url="?curid=535476" title="Crash incompatibility">
<text>Crash incompatibility, crash compatibility, vehicle incompatibility, and vehicle compatibility are terms in the automobile crash testing industry. They refer to the tendency of some vehicles to inflict more damage on another vehicle (the &quot;crash partner vehicle&quot;) in two-car crashes. Vehicle &quot;incompatibility&quot; is said to lead to more dangerous, fatal crashes, while &quot;compatibility&quot; can prevent injury in otherwise comparable crashes.

== Causes ==
The most obvious source of crash incompatibility is mass; a high-mass vehicle such as a large MPV or SUV will tend to cause much more serious damage in a crash with a lighter vehicle such as a typical sedan or compact car. In particular, research by Michael Anderson and Maximilian Auffhammer suggests that &quot;controlling for own-vehicle weight, 
being hit by a vehicle that is 1,000 pounds heavier generates a 40-50% increase in fatality 
risk.&quot; Incompatibility may also result from the specific shape, stiffness, or other design aspects of the impacting vehicles. For example, some SUVs and pickup trucks ride higher than cars and lack crumple zones to absorb impact energy. Another source of incompatibility is that heavier vehicles are required to have stronger front ends because of today&#x27;s test requirements like the NCAP test.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has done studies of the &quot;aggressiveness&quot; of vehicle designs. The term &quot;aggressiveness&quot; is used to denote the average injury risk a vehicle imposes on occupants of other vehicles during collisions. A 2003 NHTSA study estimated that in vehicle to vehicle crashes, the design of minivans was 1.16 times as aggressive as cars, pickups were 1.39 times more aggressive, and SUVs were 1.71 times more aggressive than cars. When weight was included in the analysis, light trucks (including SUVs) were estimated to be 3.3 times more aggressive than cars in head-on crashes and perhaps more so in side impact crashes.

=== Controversy ===
These studies have been controversial as they affect public perception and policy decisions on CAFE standards and light truck safety test standards as they exist today. NHTSA does not define a car or a light truck based on weight (e.g., the Chrysler PT Cruiser is classified as a light truck whereas a Lexus LS 600h L, a vehicle that weighs 66% more per published specifications, is classified as a car). So while there have been no proposals to eliminate light trucks (which includes minivans, SUVs and pickups), doing so would not eliminate incompatibility because there would still be lighter vehicles crashing into heavier vehicles.

== Solutions ==
There has been extensive research and testing done by NHTSA, other governments, research organizations as well as automobile manufacturers to find solutions that improve safety in the small cars when colliding with larger vehicles. In the United States, a group of experts proposed major steps to improve compatibility and these have been accepted as a voluntary regulation by American automotive manufacturers as well as by most other companies selling vehicles in the U.S. The Canadian government has also accepted these recommendations. The recommendations require all manufacturers to either (a) lower the height of the primary structure (also called frame rail) of all SUV and pickup trucks so that they overlap the primary structure of the cars; or (b) add another structure (called Secondary Energy Absorbing Structure) to the SUVs and pickup truck that cannot meet the first option. Latest studies have shown that these have improved the safety in cars when struck by SUVs. However, no such benefit has been observed in pickup truck to car crashes. It is unclear whether or not certain aftermarket modifications are taken into account, such as &quot;lift kits&quot; which raise the frame or suspension of a vehicle for increased ground clearance. Such modifications would likely greatly reduce the effectiveness of modern auto-safety advances due to causing the rigid parts of a pickup or SUV to strike the weaker parts of lower vehicles, rather than the reinforced regions in an accident. State laws regarding the use of such modifications vary widely, and many have laws that aren&#x27;t enforced. As of now, there are no Federal laws regarding the bumper height of trucks and SUV&#x27;s.

== History ==
Although much of the crash incompatibility debate in recent years has centered on SUVs, the concept has been around far longer. When subcompact cars were introduced in the 1970s, there was a fear that incompatibilities of mass and design could lead to more serious injuries for drivers of these smaller, lighter vehicles. Crash incompatibility remains an area of active study.

Fournier was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal in the 1935 election and was subsequently re-elected in 1940, 1945, and 1949. He became the youngest member of the Senate in 1953 and served until his death.

He studied law at McGill University and at the Université de Montréal. He was only 27 when he became the Liberal MP for Maisonneuve-Rosemont. He was re-elected in 1940, 1945, and 1949. He was called to the bar in 1938. In 1953, he entered the senate, called by Prime Minister Louis Saint-Laurent.

After two previous attempts in 1950 and 1954, he was elected mayor of Montreal in 1957. He initiated the Expo 67 project.

He had been interested in municipal politics since 1950. Although he ran for mayor five times between 1950 and 1962, he won only once, in 1957, against Jean Drapeau. At this election, Fournier was heading a new municipal party, the Ralliement du Grand Montréal (Greater Montreal Movement), which brought together Drapeau&#x27;s opponents. Fournier took also advantage of the support of Québec&#x27;s premier, Maurice Duplessis.

During his term as mayor, Fournier confined himself to representative functions and acted more as a spectator, mainly because Drapeau&#x27;s Civic Action League still held a majority on city council. Partly due to this, Drapeau, now running under the banner of the Civic Party of Montreal, defeated him in a 1960 rematch.

His administration was especially marked by the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, the Boulevard Métropolitain and the candidacy of Montréal for the 1967 World&#x27;s Fair. After his attempts to run for mayor, Fournier decided to return to the Senate.

<text>Connecticut&#x27;s Beardsley Zoo, located in Bridgeport, Connecticut, is the only Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)–accredited zoo in the state of Connecticut. The zoo includes one of the few carousels in the state. The zoo has around 500 animals, from over 100 species, and welcomes about 280,000 visitors a year.

==History==
=== The Park ===
In 1878, James W. Beardsley, a wealthy farmer, donated over of hilly, rural land bordering on the Pequonnock River, with a distant view of Long Island Sound, to the city of Bridgeport on the condition that &quot;the city shall accept and keep the same forever as a public park&quot;. In 1881, the city contracted Frederick Law Olmsted, famous for creating New York City&#x27;s Central Park, to create a design for Beardsley Park. Olmsted described the existing land as &quot;pastoral, sylvan and idyllic&quot; and, in 1884, delivered his plan for a simple, rural park for the residents to enjoy:[The land donated by Beardsley] is thoroughly rural and just such a countryside as a family of good taste and healthy nature would resort to, if seeking a few hours&#x27; complete relief from scenes associated with the wear and tear of ordinary town life... It is a better picnic ground than any possessed by the city of New York, after spending twenty million on parks... The object of any public outlay upon it should be to develop and bring out these distinctive local advantages, and make them available to extensive use in the future by large numbers of people.Olmsted was the principal architect of the site. Architect Joseph W. Northrup designed Island Bridge, a bridge to an island in the park. In 1909, the city erected a statue created by Charles Henry Niehaus in honor of Beardsley at the park&#x27;s Noble Avenue entrance. Beardsley Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.

=== The Zoo ===

At the time of the park&#x27;s creation, the city of Bridgeport was home to Phineas T. Barnum and his world-famous circus. Barnum would exercise his animals through the streets of Bridgeport, and people gathered in Beardsley Park to see zebras and camels walking by.

In 1920, Bridgeport Parks Commissioner, Wesley Hayes, began a campaign to create a city zoo within the park. He requested that the citizens of Bridgeport contribute animals to start the zoo. Within the first year, eighteen exotic birds were donated. By 1927, the zoo had acquired a variety of exotic animals, including a camel donated by the Barnum and Bailey Circus.

In 1997, the Connecticut Zoological Society, a nonprofit support group for the zoo, purchased the zoo from the city. The society continues to run the zoo as a private, nonprofit institution with assistance from the state of Connecticut and the city of Bridgeport.

In 2007, the zoo became the first in the Northeast to exhibit Chacoan peccaries. In October 2011, it also became the first zoo in the Northeast to breed the species.

On July 25, 2009, the zoo, in partnership with the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), held an Exotic Animal Amnesty Day, where people could turn in their exotic pets to the state without fear of prosecution. During the event 135 animals were surrendered, 14 of which were illegal. On March 31, 2012, the zoo and DEEP held another amnesty day, this time only aiming to accept animals which were illegal to own in Connecticut or that were in very bad condition. Seven animals were surrendered, five of them illegal.

In January 2010, the oldest Andean condor in the world, Thaao, died at the zoo after being a resident for 17 years.

On January 22, 2011, an endangered Brazilian ocelot kitten was born at the zoo through oviductal artificial insemination marking the first time that this kind of artificial insemination had successfully worked in an exotic wildcat. The achievement was made with the help of the Cincinnati Zoo&#x27;s C.R.E.W.

In 2012, Connecticut&#x27;s Beardsley Zoo celebrated its 90th anniversary. The zoo celebrated its birthday with guest promotions and a temporary summer exhibition of giant tortoises.

In September 2014, the zoo received top honors in the 2014 AZA Education Award for their outstanding education program.

==Exhibits and animals==

Connecticut&#x27;s Beardsley Zoo is divided into nine major exhibits:
#Rainforest Building: An indoor building featuring several animals from tropical South America, including Brazilian ocelot (&quot;Leopardus pardalis mitis&quot;), black howler, white-faced saki, golden lion tamarin, Goeldi&#x27;s monkey, Hoffman&#x27;s two-toed sloth, Brazilian agouti, common vampire bat, scarlet ibis, Yacare caiman, red-tailed boa, Hispaniolan slider, Amazon milk frog and more. In 2015, the zoo installed a green roof to the building. The roof includes a mix of &quot;Sedum&quot; plants as well as grasses and chives. The roof is designed to absorb 60–70% of the rainwater that would otherwise drain into the sewage system, as well as naturally insulate the building, absorb heat from the sun instead of reflecting it off, and naturally filter water so it can be reused by the zoo.
#Predators: A small row of enclosures featuring Amur tigers, and Amur leopards which first arrived in 2013. The zoo plans to build a larger tiger enclosure with glass-window viewing. Former residents include Canada lynx and a rare andean bear named Joaquim.
#Alligator Alley: A small trail featuring various animals from the Southeastern United States, including grey fox, North American river otter, bald eagle, sandhill crane, and American alligator. The exhibit also features a small walk-through aviary home to various small birds and turtles. The two foxes were rescue animals born in South Carolina, the cranes rescued in Wisconsin, and the eagles were rescued from Alaska and Florida respectively.

#Hoofstock Trail: A long trail which loops around the zoo from Pampas Plains to Predators. The exhibit features animals native to the Great Plains such as plains bison, pronghorn, white-tailed deer, black-tailed prairie dog, turkey vulture, and barred owl. One of the female deer was orphaned on Beardsley Park grounds in 2005, and was initially exhibited in Alligator Alley. The zoo had a Pronghorn fawn born one June 8, 2012.
#New England Farmyard: Designed as a small rural farm, the exhibit features a collection of farm animals, mainly of breeds which originated in New England, as well as some wild species that might be found in rural Connecticut. Domestic animals include Dexter cattle, llama, threatened Guinea hog, Cotswold sheep, various goat breeds, a feral cat, domestic rabbit, and various chicken, goose, and duck breeds. Wild animals include North American porcupine, great horned owl, snowy owl, American barn owl, common raven, tundra swan, cackling goose, and diamondback terrapin. The zoo has bred several rare breeds on many occasions, including Guinea hogs almost yearly since 2009.
#W.O.L.F: A small exhibit near the zoo&#x27;s entrance which features Mexican wolves and a red wolf. The zoo was home to two timber wolves. They were replaced by the Mexican wolves. The exhibit is designed to look like a trapper&#x27;s cabin and discusses the work the zoo does with these highly endangered species. The zoo has bred red wolves many times, with the latest birth being of four pups in June 2014, and some of the animals born at the zoo have been reintroduced to the wild. The zoo received three female Mexican wolves in 2013, and hope to one day breed the species for reintroduction back into the wild. &quot;W.O.L.F&quot; stands for Wolf Observation Learning Facility.
#Native Reptile House: A small wooden building near the entrance of the New England Farmyard, the exhibit features various species of reptiles and amphibians native to Connecticut. Species include black rat snake, eastern milk snake, eastern garter snake, common snapping turtle, North American wood turtle, spotted turtle, three-toed box turtle, eastern box turtle, American bullfrog, eastern grey treefrog, and pickerel frog.
#Professor Beardsley&#x27;s Research Station: While not always open to the public, the exhibit is used mainly as an education center and is home to several of the zoo&#x27;s education animals, such as European legless lizard, and bullsnake. The building is also where the zoo raises brook trout to be released into the wild. In June 2015, the zoo added three eastern hellbenders to the exhibit.
#Pampas Plains: This new exhibit opened in 2015 and is phase one of the zoo&#x27;s &quot;South American Adventure&quot;. It features a raised walkway to allow for better viewing and is home to maned wolves, giant anteaters, Chacoan peccaries, and greater rheas. An anteater was born at the zoo on February 13, 2016, the first in the zoo&#x27;s history. On July 30, 2018, another anteater was born. Anteaters and peccaries are seen only when the temperature is in the 50s or warmer.
#Natt Family Red Panda Habitat: In October 2015, the zoo became home to a young male western red panda from the Franklin Park Zoo. He was temporary exhibited in the outdoor monkey enclosure outside the Rainforest Building. In October 2018 the zoo officially opened The Natt Family Red Panda Habitat to the public. The new habitat gives the zoo&#x27;s two red pandas space to roam and play and gives visitors two new viewing areas.
In addition to these exhibit, the zoo is also home to a pair of Andean condors which can be found by the entrance of the zoo, as well as free-roaming Indian peafowl, West African helmeted guineafowl, and occasionally wild turkeys.

The zoo also has a carousel and one of the largest greenhouses in Connecticut. The Victorian Greenhouse is also home to two agave plants that have grown flower stalks, and are expected to bloom soon as of January 2020. The plants are known as &quot;century plants&quot; because they bloom so rarely, roughly once every 30 years. At the entrance, a pair of brick buildings that once served as trolley barns for the city of Bridgeport now hold administrative offices.

===Future plans===
In continuation of the zoo&#x27;s &quot;South American Adventure&quot;, the zoo will receive $2.5 million in state funding to build &quot;Spirit of the Cloud Forest&quot;, featuring a new pair of Andean bears and possibly a new enclosure for their condors. The new exhibit will see the return of the bear species to the zoo since their last male left in 2011. Additionally, the zoo plans to add spider monkeys to the outdoor yard by the Rainforest Building.

===Temporary exhibits===
In August 2011, the zoo hosted the animal rescue organization &quot;Rainforest Reptiles&quot; in a temporary display of several rescued exotic reptiles, including an albino alligator.

In 2012, the zoo temporarily exhibited a Galápagos giant tortoise and Aldabra giant tortoise, from the Cameron Park Zoo, outside of the greenhouse for the 90th anniversary.

In 2014, the zoo held temporary camel rides from a pair of dromedary camels.

In 2015, the zoo brought back the camel rides due to popular demand. The pair from 2014 returned with a third animal. The zoo also exhibited several African spurred tortoises in the same temporary yard the giant tortoises had been in.

On April 26, 2016, the zoo added four African penguins in a temporary exhibit by the zoo&#x27;s Peacock Café. They were on exhibit until September 30, 2016.

On November 25, 2017, two Amur tigers cubs (two sisters) were born at the zoo. The zoo began a webcam live-streaming of the tiger cubs via a webcam located in their nursery.

==Conservation==

The zoo takes part in several in-situ and ex-situ conservation programs. Being an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), the zoo partakes in multiple captive breeding programs and Species Survival Plans. The zoo works to care for and breed multiple endangered species such as Amur tigers, Amur leopards, Canada lynx, Brazilian ocelots, red wolves, Mexican wolves, maned wolves, giant anteaters, Chacoan peccaries, golden lion tamarins, North American river otters, Andean condors, spotted turtles, and eastern hellbenders.

The Connecticut&#x27;s Beardsley Zoo Conservation Fund, established in 2002, awards up to $15,000 in funds to worldwide conservation programs. To date, the fund has supported the following programs:

The zoo has also sent animals in their collection to be reintroduced into the wild to help boost wild populations. Species the zoo has contributed to the reintroduction of include red wolves, golden lion tamarins, Andean condors, and brook trout. The zoo hopes to soon breed and reintroduce Mexican wolves as well.

The zoo also takes in animals orphaned or injured in the wild that cannot be released:
*In June 2005, a two-week-old female white-tailed deer was found orphaned on Beardsley Park grounds. She was taken in by the zoo and exhibited in Alligator Alley before being moved in with bison and other deer in the Hoofstock Trail.
*In early 2010, a trio of male bald eagles arrived at the zoo. Two arrived from the Alaska Raptor Center and one from the Florida Audubon Society. All three had wing injuries which have made them unable to fly and thus were not able to be released back into the wild.
*In September 2010, a pair of sandhill cranes arrived from the Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The pair had been raised separately by humans before being orphaned and eventually donated to the sanctuary. While the pair got along fine, they did not fit in with the other cranes at the sanctuary and the decision was made to move them elsewhere. Since the pair were raised by people, it was doubtful they would fare well in the wild and were taken in by the zoo instead.
*In May 2012, the zoo took in a three-week-old male bobcat which had been separated from its mother shortly after birth. Rescued in Connecticut, the zoo took in the animal after being contacted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection due to there not being a licensed bobcat rehabilitation center in the state. The animal has been named &quot;Beeze&quot; (pronounced &quot;B-Z&quot;) and is used as an animal ambassador by the zoo&#x27;s education department.
*In August 2012, a pair of grey foxes arrived from Alligator Adventure in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. They were rescued as pups from the wild about four or five years prior to arriving at the zoo.
*The zoo&#x27;s female barred owl was given to the zoo by a wildlife rehabilitator after being rescued in Southbury, Connecticut. She has damaged left wing and a cataract in her left eye, making her unable to survive in the wild.

===Education programs===
The zoo&#x27;s core education program, the Conservation Discovery Corps (CDC), is a science and conservation-based program for high school students ages 14–18. Participants are trained in both zoo and field research, and are given an inside perspective on the operations of the zoo and gain experience in conservation education, public service, and public speaking. The students also work side by side with licensed field biologists, study the role of zoos in conservation, and help educate zoo visitors.

In September 2014, the CDC received top honors in the 2014 AZA Education Award for its outstanding ability to promote conservation knowledge, educate youth, and obtain success in its projects.

<doc id="535491" wikidata="Q5282332" url="?curid=535491" title="Diskworld">
<text>Diskworld () was a disk magazine for the Apple Macintosh computer system, published by Softdisk beginning in 1988. It was a sister publication of &quot;Softdisk&quot; for the Apple II, &quot;Loadstar&quot; for the Commodore 64, and &quot;Big Blue Disk&quot; for the IBM PC. &quot;Diskworld&quot; ceased publication in 1998.

==Overview==
&quot;Diskworld&quot; was originally designed and created by Sean Golden (Managing Editor), Jeff Billings (Senior Programmer) and Lynda Fowler (Junior Programmer). Sean Golden wrote the original Diskworld &quot;shell&quot; program which provided access to the monthly disk contents. He also wrote most of the editorial content each month. Jeff Billings and Lynda Fowler developed monthly productivity, utility or game programs which were published on the disk. Jeff and Lynda also provided some editorial content, and Sean also contributed programs. Freelance programmers also provided content for a fee. The product was broken down into editorials, articles, reviews, artwork and software, all presented with the custom &quot;shell&quot; program which allowed users to run the disk without having to swap out system disks on the original Macintosh. The early issues were published on 400K disks, but moved to 800K disks when the 400K disks become obsolete.

Eventually it was possible to produce a version of the &quot;shell&quot; program that did not carry a duplicate version of the Mac OS when hard drives became commonplace. That allowed for more content to be published on each disk. Jeff Billings left the company and Lynda Fowler became Senior Programmer. When Sean Golden was promoted to Softdisk Publishing, Inc. Publisher, Lynda Fowler became Managing Editor of &quot;Diskworld&quot;.

Later, &quot;Diskworld&quot; was renamed Softdisk for Mac, but it ceased publication in 1998 along with the other disk magazines published by Softdisk (other than &quot;Loadstar&quot;, which broke off as an independent company and continued into the 2000s) as the company moved more into Internet development.

<text>The Scottish Prohibition Party was a minor Scottish political party which advocated alcohol prohibition.

The party was founded in 1901. In its early years, Bob Stewart acted as the party&#x27;s full-time organiser. In 1908, Stewart and Edwin Scrymgeour were elected to Dundee Town Council.

From the 1908 by-election onwards, Scrymgeour stood for the party in the Dundee constituency. Stewart acted as his election agent in 1910, but fell out with him over his religiosity. He led a Marxist split, the Socialist Prohibition and Reform Party, which merged with the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1920.

Scrymgeour was finally elected as an MP for Dundee in the 1922 general election, when he and the Labour candidate E. D. Morel defeated the National Liberal candidates, one of which was future Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In Parliament, on issues other than prohibition, he generally supported the Labour Party.

Scrymgeour lost his seat at the 1931 general election. The party was disbanded in 1935, against the wishes of Scrymgeour.

<doc id="535503" wikidata="Q843511" url="?curid=535503" title="Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs">
<text>Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs is the only studio album by the English–American rock band Derek and the Dominos, released on 9 November 1970 as a double album by Polydor Records and Atco Records. It is best known for its title track, &quot;Layla&quot;, which is often regarded as Eric Clapton&#x27;s greatest musical achievement. The other band members were Bobby Whitlock (vocals, keyboard), Jim Gordon (drums, percussion), and Carl Radle (bass). Duane Allman played lead and slide guitar on 11 of the 14 songs.

Initially regarded as a critical and commercial disappointment, it failed to chart in Britain and peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart in the United States. It returned to the US albums chart again in 1972, 1974 and 1977, and has since been certified Gold by the RIAA. The album finally debuted on the UK Albums Chart in 2011, peaking at number 68. In 2000, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2003, television network VH1 named &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; the 89th-greatest album of all time. In the same year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 117 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It was ranked at number 226 on the 2020 reboot of the list. It was voted number 287 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2012, the Super Deluxe Edition of &quot;Layla&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album.

==Background==
Derek and the Dominos grew out of Eric Clapton&#x27;s frustration with the hype associated with his previous bands, the supergroups Cream and Blind Faith. Following the latter&#x27;s dissolution, he joined Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends, whom he had come to know while they were the opening act on Blind Faith&#x27;s US tour in the summer of 1969. After that band also split up, a Friends alumnus, Bobby Whitlock, joined up with Clapton in Surrey, England. From April 1970, the two spent weeks writing a number of songs &quot;just to have something to play&quot;, as Whitlock put it. These songs would later make up the bulk of the material on &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot;.

Having toured with Joe Cocker straight after leaving Delaney &amp; Bonnie, Carl Radle and Jim Gordon reunited with Clapton and Whitlock in England. Clapton attempted to avoid the limelight under cover of the anonymous &quot;Derek and the Dominos&quot;, with whom he played a tour of small clubs in Britain during the first three weeks of August. The group&#x27;s name had reportedly resulted from a gaffe made by the announcer at their first concert, who mispronounced the band&#x27;s provisional name, &quot;Eric &amp; The Dynamos&quot;. In fact, Clapton chose &quot;Derek and the Dominos&quot; because he did not want his name and celebrity to get in the way of maintaining a &quot;band&quot; image. When the tour was over, they headed for Criteria Studios in Miami to record an album.

The source of the album&#x27;s eventual centrepiece, &quot;Layla&quot;, was rooted in Clapton&#x27;s infatuation with Pattie Boyd, the wife of his friend and Beatle lead guitarist George Harrison,&lt;ref name=&quot;Layla40/Goldmine&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who had joined Clapton as a guitarist on Delaney &amp; Bonnie&#x27;s European tour in December 1969. Dave Marsh, in &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll&quot;, wrote that &quot;there are few moments in the repertoire of recorded rock where a singer or writer has reached so deeply into himself that the effect of hearing them is akin to witnessing a murder, or a suicide … to me, &#x27;Layla&#x27; is the greatest of them.&quot;

==Duane Allman&#x27;s arrival==
Veteran producer Tom Dowd was at Criteria working on the Allman Brothers Band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Idlewild South&quot;, when the studio received a phone call that Clapton was bringing the Dominos to Miami to record. Upon hearing this, guitarist Duane Allman indicated that he would love to drop by and watch, if Clapton approved.

Allman later called Dowd to let him know that his band was in town to perform a benefit concert on 26 August. When Clapton learned of this he insisted on going to see their show, saying, &quot;You mean that guy who plays on the back of (Wilson Pickett&#x27;s) &#x27;Hey Jude&#x27;? … I want to see &quot;him&quot; play … let&#x27;s go.&quot; Stage hands seated Clapton and company in front of the barricade separating the audience from the stage. When they sat down, Allman was playing a solo. As he turned around and opened his eyes and saw Clapton, he froze. Dickey Betts, the Allmans&#x27; other lead guitarist, picked up where Allman left off, but when he followed Allman&#x27;s eyes to Clapton, he had to turn his back to keep from freezing, himself.

After the show, Allman asked Clapton if he could come by the studio to watch some recording sessions, but Clapton invited him there directly, saying: &quot;Bring your guitar; you got to play!&quot; Jamming together overnight, the two bonded; Dowd reported that they &quot;were trading licks, they were swapping guitars, they were talking shop and information and having a ball – no holds barred, just admiration for each other&#x27;s technique and facility.&quot; Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the &quot;musical brother I&#x27;d never had but wished I did&quot;.

==Recording==
The majority of the songs on &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; were products of Clapton and Whitlock&#x27;s collaboration, which produced six of the nine originals on the recording, with five covers making up the balance. Clapton used a diminutive 5-watt tweed Fender Champ during the sessions, which has grown to legend since.

===Original songs===
Clapton and Whitlock co-wrote &quot;I Looked Away&quot;, &quot;Keep on Growing&quot;, &quot;Anyday&quot;, &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot;, &quot;Tell the Truth&quot; and &quot;Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?&quot; Whitlock also contributed &quot;Thorn Tree in the Garden&quot;, while Clapton brought &quot;I Am Yours&quot; (from a poem by Nizami) and &quot;Layla&quot; (with a coda credited to Jim Gordon).

&quot;Tell the Truth&quot; had been initially recorded with an upbeat tempo in June 1970 with producer Phil Spector. It was issued as a single, with &quot;Roll It Over&quot; on the B-side. However, as Whitlock recalls, Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound approach did not fit the band&#x27;s style, and they had the single withdrawn. On 28 August, with Allman contributing slide, the song was recorded as a long and slow instrumental jam. The version with vocals released on &quot;Layla&quot; captures the jam&#x27;s slower pace. Both vocal versions were later included on the 1972 compilation &quot;The History of Eric Clapton&quot;.

The last track on the album, &quot;Thorn Tree in the Garden&quot;, was recorded with Whitlock, Clapton, Allman, Radle and Gordon sitting in a circle around a single microphone.

===Covers===
The album&#x27;s five covers included the blues standards &quot;Nobody Knows You When You&#x27;re Down and Out&quot; (Jimmy Cox), &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; (Charles Segar, Willie Broonzy), and &quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman&quot; (Billy Myles), a version of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Little Wing&quot;, and an up-tempo take on Chuck Willis&#x27;s doo-wop ballad &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;.

According to Dowd, the recording of &quot;Key to the Highway&quot; was unplanned, triggered by the band hearing Sam Samudio performing the song for his album &quot;Sam, Hard and Heavy&quot; in another room at the studio. As the Dominos spontaneously started playing it themselves, Dowd told the engineers to roll tape, resulting in the tune&#x27;s telltale fade-in. Bobby Whitlock&#x27;s version of the story is that the tape was rolling non-stop for the entire session, but that Dowd had taken a lavatory break leaving the faders on the mixer down. As the jam began, he came running back into the control room, still pulling up his trousers and yelling, &quot;Push up the faders!&quot;

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s front cover is credited as &quot;Cover painting by Frandsen-De Schomberg with thanks to his son, Emile, for the abuse of his house&quot;. Bobby Whitlock revealed in an interview that while they were staying at Emile Frandsen&#x27;s house in France in August 1970, he took them to his father&#x27;s studio just after they had made a mess by having an egg fight. It was there that they saw &quot;La Fille au Bouquet&quot; (Girl with bouquet), the painting by Émile-Théodore Frandsen de Shomberg which became the cover of Layla. Eric Clapton immediately spotted a likeness between the blonde-haired woman it depicted and Pattie Boyd. Clapton also insisted that the image be used unadorned on the &quot;Layla&quot; sleeve, with no text added to give either the band&#x27;s name or the title of the album.

46 years after Frandsen gave the painting to Eric Clapton, it was the subject of a French lawsuit in which Clapton was ordered to pay compensation for altering the image on a cardboard pop up used on the 40th anniversary reissue of the album. The family of Frandsen de Schomberg, who died in 1969, received €15,000 ($16,400).

Clapton later gave the painting to George Harrison, who subsequently gave the painting to Boyd. Boyd put the painting up for sale at auction at Christie&#x27;s in February 2024 alongside letters and notes from both Clapton and Harrison, with an estimate of £40-60,000. After a prolonged bidding battle, the painting was sold for £1,976,000.

==Release and reception==
Atco Records issued &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; in November 1970 in the United States, with a UK release following in December, on Polydor. The album failed to chart in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dominos/AM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while in the US, it peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart. Despite this achievement, &quot;Layla&quot; was viewed as a commercial failure, according to authors Harry Shapiro and Jan Reid. Dowd later rued the difficulty of getting airplay for the songs on US radio, while Shapiro attributes its lack of success in Britain to minimal promotion by Polydor and what he terms &quot;the unrelenting and monotonous Press litany of a post-Cream withdrawal syndrome&quot;. Concerned that the press and the public were unaware of Clapton&#x27;s involvement, Atco and Polydor distributed badges reading &quot;Derek is Eric&quot;.

&quot;Layla&quot; also flopped critically, according to Shapiro: &quot;As with Eric&#x27;s first solo album, the reviewers liked the guitars-on-fire-stuff … but regarded the [love songs] as little more than fluff.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro/Mojo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Roy Hollingworth opined that the songs ranged &quot;from the magnificent to a few lengths of complete boredom&quot;, and specified: &quot;We have Hendrix&#x27;s &#x27;Little Wing&#x27; played with such spreading beauty that Jimi would surely have clapped till his hands bled, and then we have &#x27;I Am Yours&#x27; … a bossa that novas in pitiful directions.&quot; While he identified portions of &quot;pretty atrocious vocal work&quot;, Hollingworth considered &quot;Layla&quot; to be &quot;far more musical&quot; than &quot;Eric Clapton&quot;, and praised Clapton and Allman for &quot;giv[ing] about every superb essay possible on the playing of the electric guitar&quot;. Writing in &quot;Saturday Review&quot; magazine, Ellen Sander described it as &quot;pointless and boring&quot; and &quot;a basket case of an album&quot;, and said that Clapton had &quot;all but blown his musical credibility&quot;. Grouping the Dominos album with recent releases by Bob Dylan, the Beatles and Stephen Stills, Sander added, &quot;It&#x27;s [Clapton&#x27;s] instincts, not his talents, that are out of synch, and he is certainly not alone, nor by any means the worst offender, in depositing garbage into the vault of a guaranteed personal audience.&quot; In a more favourable review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ed Leimbacher noted the album&#x27;s &quot;filler&quot; material but added that &quot;what remains is what you hoped for from the conjunction of Eric&#x27;s developing style, the Delaney and Bonnie styled rhythm section, and the strengths of &#x27;Skydog&#x27; Allman&#x27;s session abilities.&quot; Leimbacher found Clapton&#x27;s singing &quot;always at least adequate, and sometimes quite good&quot; and concluded, &quot;forget any indulgences and filler – it&#x27;s still one hell of an album.&quot;

In a rave review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau applauded the contrast of &quot;the high-keyed precision of [Clapton&#x27;s] guitar&quot; with &quot;the relaxed rocking of Allman/Whitlock/Radle/Gordon&quot;. He wrote in conclusion that, &quot;even though this one has the look of a greedy, lazy, slapdash studio session, I think it may be Eric Clapton&#x27;s most consistent recording ... one of those rare instances when musicians join together for profit and a lark and come up with a mature and original sound.&quot; Christgau rewarded the album with a rare A+ grade. In a review for the album&#x27;s 1972 reissue, Ed Naha of &quot;Circus&quot; called &quot;Layla&quot; an &quot;amazing collection of Clapton tumblers&quot; and stated, &quot;Clapton shines once again as the high priest of rock guitar.&quot;

===Reappraisal===

Since its initial reception, &quot;Layla&quot; has been acclaimed by critics and regarded as Clapton&#x27;s greatest overall work. In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Christgau dubbed it &quot;Clapton&#x27;s most carefully conceived recording&quot;, while admiring the album&#x27;s &quot;relaxed shuffle and simple rock and roll&quot; and Clapton&#x27;s &quot;generally warm&quot; singing. Christgau wrote in conclusion: &quot;his meaning is realized at those searing peaks when a pained sense of limits – why does love have to be so sad, I got the bell-bottom blues, &quot;Lay-la&quot; – is posed against the good times in an explosive compression of form.&quot; Anthony DeCurtis of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;a masterpiece&quot; and praised its raw nature, writing that &quot;the playing on the album, too, teeters on the edge of chaos but never tips.&quot;

AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised Allman&#x27;s slide guitar work for &quot;push[ing] Clapton to new heights&quot; and stated, &quot;what really makes &quot;Layla&quot; such a powerful record is that Clapton, ignoring the traditions that occasionally painted him into a corner, simply tears through these songs with burning, intense emotion.&quot; Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; complimented the album&#x27;s &quot;blues standards and sensitive originals&quot; and noted Clapton&#x27;s fiery affinity with Allman, whom Gill writes &quot;would ensure the epochal status&quot; of the album. Yahoo! Music&#x27;s Dave DiMartino also noted Allman&#x27;s &quot;stinging guitarwork&quot; and described &quot;Layla&quot; as &quot;Clapton&#x27;s masterwork, and one of the finest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll albums of the &#x27;70s&quot;, commenting that &quot;this best-selling double LP established Clapton&#x27;s post-Cream superstardom.&quot; Jim DeRogatis of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it &quot;the strongest recording of Eric Clapton’s career, and arguably the greatest blues-rock album ever made&quot;, while &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Greg Kot hailed it as Clapton&#x27;s &quot;blues-rock guitar masterpiece&quot;.

==Live performances==
Derek and the Dominos went on tour to support &quot;Layla&quot; and performances from the October–December 1970 US tour were released in January 1973 on &quot;In Concert&quot;. Allman never toured with Derek and the Dominos, but made two guest appearances with them: on 1 December 1970 at the Curtis Hixon Hall in Tampa (&quot;Soul Mates&quot; bootleg LP) and the following day at Onondaga County War Memorial in Syracuse, New York.

The band appeared on &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;, which became their only television appearance. Filmed at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Tennessee, and broadcast on 6 January 1971, the band performed &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot; and then joined Cash and Carl Perkins for the Perkins&#x27; classic, &quot;Matchbox&quot;.

Clapton continued to play the song &quot;Layla&quot; live, as at Live Aid (in Philadelphia) in 1985. In 2006, Clapton and J.J. Cale recorded &quot;The Road to Escondido&quot;, on which Allman Brothers guitarist Derek Trucks played guitar. Following this, Clapton went on tour with Trucks as part of his band. Clapton explained later that playing with Trucks made him feel like he was in Derek and the Dominos again. As the tour progressed the set changed, with the first half of the show consisting entirely of songs from &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; and culminating in &quot;Layla&quot;.

Tedeschi Trucks Band covered the album in its entirety on 24 August 2019 at Lockn&#x27; with Trey Anastasio of Phish and Doyle Bramhall II sitting in.

==Compact disc releases==

There are at least nine distinct releases of &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; on compact disc:
# The 1983 two-CD set (one per LP) on RSO Records, 16-bit remastering;
# &quot;The Layla Sessions&quot;, the 18 September 1990, remixed on one CD, with two additional &quot;sessions discs&quot;;
# The 15 September 1993, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab 24-kt limited edition gold CD release, 20-bit remastering;
# The 20 August 1996, Polydor 20-bit remaster, part of the &quot;Eric Clapton Remasters series&quot;;
# The 9 November 2004, Polydor hybrid SACD/CD remaster;
# The 21 March 2011, UMC, 40th Anniversary remaster;
# The 25 Sep 2013, Universal Music Japan Japanese Platinum SHM-CD remaster.
# 25 Feb 2017 “Derek and the Dominos/Layla” Mobile Fidelity SACD 
# The 22 Sep 2020, &quot;Derek and the Dominos / Layla&quot; 50th anniversary sets

The first CD release (manufactured in 1983 in Japan) is a two-CD version. Because this album is more than 77 minutes it did not fit onto early CDs, which had a maximum play time of approximately 74 and a half minutes. The first CD was full of tape hiss, since it was made from a tape copy many generations removed from the original 1970 stereo master. This mastering&#x27;s negative reception motivated at least one attempt to remaster the CD during the 1980s. Improvements, however, were not very significant because the original 1970 stereo master tapes could not be found at the time.

To mark the album&#x27;s twentieth anniversary in 1990, an extended version of the album was released as a deluxe three-CD set, with extensive liner notes titled &quot;The Layla Sessions: 20th Anniversary Edition&quot;. The first disc has the same tracks as the original LP, remixed in stereo from the 16-track analog source tapes and digitally remastered. This 1990 remix, issued by Polydor, has also been released as a single CD apart from the box set. The remix has some significant changes including center placement of the bass, which in the original mix was often mixed into either the left or right channel. The other two discs of &quot;The Layla Sessions&quot; include a number of jam sessions, including the historic jam from the night that Clapton and Allman met. Also included were out-takes of some of the songs, and the previously unreleased tracks &quot;Mean Old World&quot;, &quot;It Hurts Me Too&quot;, and &quot;Tender Love&quot;.

In 1993, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab gave the original 1970 stereo master tapes meticulous treatment for the first time and pressed the album on an expensive, limited edition 24kt gold CD. This MFSL 20-bit remastering of &quot;Layla&quot; preserved more of the fidelity of the original recordings than had previously been heard on CD. The MFSL version was significantly cleaner than the first CD releases, but also removed some of &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;-like technique that was added during mastering for vinyl. Polydor&#x27;s 1996 remaster as part of the &quot;Eric Clapton Remasters series&quot; was done in much the same manner as the MFSL version, but on a standard aluminum CD at a normal price. The Polydor 2004 SACD/CD dual-layer hybrid release remixed the album in 5.1 surround sound on the SACD layer and remastered the 1970 stereo version yet again on the CD layer.

The 2011, 40th Anniversary Edition comes in two versions. The two-CD &quot;Deluxe&quot; edition features five previously unreleased tracks, &quot;It&#x27;s Too Late&quot;, &quot;Got to Get Better in a Little While&quot;, &quot;Matchbox&quot; (with Carl Perkins) and &quot;Blues Power&quot; (from &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;) and a jam version of &quot;Got to Get Better in a Little While&quot;. The &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; version comprises the two-CD &quot;Deluxe&quot; album, a 5.1 Surround Sound DVD of the album, a newly remastered &quot;In Concert&quot; two-CD set, a double LP version of the album, a hardcover book, and a number of other extras.

In 2013, the album was released on Blu-ray High Fidelity Pure Audio disc. This release contains three different 24-bit/96 kHz encodings of the stereo mix, in PCM, DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD formats, each with a slightly different EQ, but did not include either 5.1 mix from the 2004 or 2011 releases.

In September 2013, Universal Music Japan issued a remastered version of Layla on SHM-CD, edited in DSD at Universal Music Studios, Tokyo. The DSD source was flat-transferred from analogue master tapes at Sterling Sound in New York City in 2013.

In February 2017, Mobile Fidelity released a hybrid SACD of the original stereo mix. The album comes in a replica gatefold sleeve and is mastered by Rob LoVerde.

==Track listing==

All four sides of the original LP were combined into one disc in most CD versions.
The LP was re-released on 180g vinyl by Simply Vinyl in the 1990s and re-mastered and re-released on 180g vinyl by Universal Music in 2008.

<doc id="535506" wikidata="Q23880" url="?curid=535506" title="Lila Downs">
<text>Ana Lila Downs Sánchez (born 9 September 1968) is a Mexican singer-songwriter. She performs her own compositions and the works of others in multiple genres, as well as tapping into Mexican traditional and popular music. She also incorporates indigenous Mexican influences and has recorded songs in many indigenous languages such as Mixtec, Zapotec, Mayan, Nahuatl and Purépecha. Born and raised in Oaxaca, she primarily studied at the Institute of Arts by Oaxaca and briefly attended the University of Minnesota, before withdrawing to focus on her musical career. She soon began performing in the traditional music scene of Oaxaca City.

Her first (independent) album, &quot;Ofrenda&quot;, was released in 1994. In 1999, Downs came to prominence with her debut studio album, &quot;La sandunga&quot;, which was a critical and commercial success. She achieved international success in 2001 with the album &quot;Border&quot; which emerged in the music scene of Mexico and Latin America in the early 2000s (decade). Downs&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Pecados y milagros&quot; (2011), topped album charts in most major markets and generated chart-topping world music albums. Her eighth album, &quot;Balas y Chocolate&quot;, was released in 2015. &quot;Salón Lágrimas y Deseo&quot;, her ninth album, came out in 2017.

Downs began performing in school, demonstrating her vocal ability with traditional music, Latin and American influences, and with her own original twist on dancing. Downs, a native Spanish speaker, also speaks fluent Mixtec and English. Downs through her activism has gone through great lengths to preserve the Mixtec language as well as many other Indigenous Mexican languages.

Influenced by Chavela Vargas, Mercedes Sosa, Lucha Villa, and Amparo Ochoa, Lila Downs is recognized for her flamboyant, diverse and outré contributions to the music industry through her traditional and authentic fashion, the majority of which are based around Mexico&#x27;s indigenous peoples&#x27; styles, cultures and heritages, which show through her performances and music videos. Her achievements include one Grammy Award and three Latin Grammy Awards.

Besides her musical career, she involves herself with humanitarian causes and political activism, especially dealing with issues of Latin America&#x27;s indigenous population.

== Early life ==

Lila Downs was born on 9 September 1968, in Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, Mexico. She is the daughter of Anita Sánchez, a Mixtec cabaret singer and Allen Downs, a Scottish-American professor of art and cinematographer from Minnesota. From an early age Downs showed interest in music. At the age of eight she began singing rancheras and other traditional Mexican songs. She began her professional career singing with mariachis. At fourteen she moved to the United States with her parents. She studied voice in Los Angeles and learned English, which her father helped her to perfect. When she was 16, her father died, and she decided to return to her native town Tlaxiaco with her mother.

One day while she was working in a store in the Mixtec mountains, a man came in to ask her to translate his son&#x27;s death certificate. She read that he had drowned trying to cross the border into the United States. This deeply affected her and has continued to her work. She talked about this in an NPR interview about her 2001 release entitled &quot;Border&quot;. 

Although today Downs is proud of her origins there was a time when she felt shame regarding her Indigenous roots. &quot;I was embarrassed to have Indian blood. I was embarrassed that my mother spoke her language in public.&quot; This led her on a path to find herself, which included dropping out of college, dyeing her hair blonde and following the band The Grateful Dead. After some time Downs found herself back in Oaxaca, a city in southern Mexico, working at her mother&#x27;s auto parts store, where she met her future husband and musical collaborator, tenor saxophonist Paul Cohen.

Downs studied Anthropology at the University of Minnesota and voice in New York. Later she attended the Institute of Science and Arts of Oaxaca in Mexico to complete her studies.

At 25, after completing academic and music studies, Downs decided to return to Tlaxiaco. Paul Cohen always encouraged her musical ventures, and she joined a group percussion called &quot;Yodoyuxi&#x27;s Cadets&quot;. Because Paul Cohen had business in the United States she began to live in both Minnesota and Oaxaca.

During her stay in Minnesota, Downs formed a group called &quot;La Trova Serrana&quot; which achieved great popularity among the Latin community within the United States, singing songs about the Zapotec values and culture. Upon her return to Mexico she started singing in bars, restaurants and clubs in the City of Oaxaca, as well as the city of Philadelphia and the state of California, always with the support of US saxophonist Paul Cohen. She received many positive critical reviews, which led to her decision to undertake an extensive tour of Mexico.

==Career==
=== 1994–1996: First albums ===
In 1994, Lila Downs independently made her first album, entitled &quot;Ofrenda&quot;. This was both a collection of traditional songs from Oaxaca and Mexico, and songs written by the singer with lyrics sung in Spanish, Mixtec and Zapotec (native languages of Oaxaca). The material was produced both independently and with the support of the Oaxacan Cultures Institute. Because this album was not a commercial success in LP or cassette, she never released a version on CD.

In 1996, Downs recorded a live session at a renowned café-bar of the City of Oaxaca. On this record Downs was accompanied by a set of well-known musicians who supported its interpretation of traditional themes, as well as country music and jazz. With this work Downs and her music became known in different parts of Mexico, and this was her first album to be released on CD. The album had a big impact, despite limited promotion and the fact that only a small number of copies were made. This CD is now out of print, and although not available as part of the official discography of Lila Downs, can be found in digital format.

=== 1997–1999: La Sandunga ===
In 1997, Lila Downs made a second recording, called &quot;Traces&quot;, on which she performed material that was to be included in later albums such as &quot;La Sandunga&quot;, &quot;Tree of Life&quot; and &quot;Border&quot;. It is an extensive compilation of items in her traditional repertoire but, like its predecessor, had no commercial distribution, so this disc is also currently out of print.

It was not until 1999, when Downs signed with the label Narada Productions, that she achieved commercial success and made herself known internationally with the album &quot;La Sandunga&quot;. Recorded a year earlier, this material came to the forefront of Mexican music and her album was one of the first to merge the sounds of traditional music and modern rhythms as jazz, blues and bolero. The album was sung in Spanish and Mixtec, and was produced by Lila Downs and Paul Cohen with the support of Xquenda Cultural Association. Because of this success, Downs participated in the soundtrack of the Mexican film &quot;Green Stones&quot; and achieved great popularity in countries such as Mexico, United States, Spain, France, England and Germany, selling over 500,000 units worldwide.

=== 1999–2000: Tree of Life/Yutu Tata ===

Downs&#x27;s next album, &quot;Tree of Life&quot;, was released in 2000. With this album the fame of Downs continued to spread to other markets in England, Switzerland, Canada and especially the United States. This work found Downs turning to her indigenous past, and the album features pre-Hispanic sounds and instruments. Several of the songs on the album are sung in native Mexican languages such as Mixtec, Zapotec and Nahuatl. In October 2000, she began a two-month tour called the Tree of Life/Árbol de la vida, which included concerts in Latin America, Europe and the US. The tour began in Mexico and ended in Spain.

=== 2001–2003: Border/La Linea (The Line) ===
&quot;Border&quot;, released by EMI Music in 2001, was the first album by Downs to feature songs sung in English. The album was released simultaneously in the United States and Mexico. With this album Downs merged sounds from different genres such as traditional folk music, hip hop, rock and chilena. It included fifteen songs, eleven in Spanish, three in English and one in Mayan. The album received generally good reviews and placed seventh in the top charts of world music. It also stirred up controversy due to its frank discussion of immigration, Indigenous marginalization and the Acteal massacre. This drew criticism, especially from politicians and the church.

The album&#x27;s first single was released in Mexico, &quot;Mi corazón me recuerda&quot;, a poem by Chiapas poet Jaime Sabines. Set to music, it achieved moderate success on the Mexican music charts. In Spain the song was called &quot;&quot;La Llorona&quot;, in France the song was called &quot;Corazoncito Tirano&quot; and in the United States the song was called &quot;Medley: Pastures of Plenty/This Land Is Your Land/Land&quot;&quot; were released as singles. The latter incorporates two Woody Guthrie songs, &quot;Pastures of Plenty&quot; and &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot; as well as original lyrics by Downs in &quot;Land&quot;.

=== 2004–2006: Una Sangre/One Blood ===
&quot;One Blood&quot;, one of Lila Downs&#x27;s most successful albums, was released in April 2004, simultaneously in the United States, Spain, and Mexico. The lyrics on this album are about migration, discrimination and the case of Mexican human rights defender Digna Ochoa. In addition to traditional songs such as &quot;La Bamba&quot;, &quot;Viborita&quot;, and &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;, the album includes genres such as son jarocho, jazz, rock and folk. This album contains thirteen tracks, three in English, one in Triqui, one in Purepecha and eight in Spanish. Lyrics were authored by Lila Downs, Paul Cohen, Celso Duarte, and Jose Martí. In 2005 Lila Downs received the Grammy Latino in the category of &quot;Best Album of World Music&quot; for this album and reached the top of the charts in United States, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, Germany and France.

=== 2006–2008: La Cantina, entre copa y copa ... ===

<doc id="535509" wikidata="Q1026416" url="?curid=535509" title="List of cities in Missouri">
<text>Missouri is a state located in the Midwestern United States. In Missouri, cities are classified into three types: 3rd Class, 4th Class, and those under constitutional charters. A few older cities are incorporated under legislative charters (Carrollton, Chillicothe, LaGrange, Liberty, Miami, Missouri City, and Pleasant Hill) which are no longer allowed. (Carthage is also a Charter City and Charter Cities are by constitution not legislation and are still allowed to this day). The level at which they incorporate is determined by their population when they incorporate. They do not change if they gain or lose in population, unless a vote is held by the people.

A municipality incorporates as a 4th Class city if the population is between 500 and 2,999 (under 500, it may incorporate as a village – see list of villages in Missouri). It may incorporate as a 3rd Class city if the population is between 3,000 and 29,999. There is more flexibility in government for 3rd Class cities than 4th Class.

Cities under constitutional charters may operate under any form of municipal government if it is enacted in the city&#x27;s charter.

<text>In Missouri, villages are municipalities which incorporated with a population under 500. If the population is larger than 500, it may incorporate as a city (see List of cities in Missouri). If the population increases beyond 500 after incorporation, a vote may be held to change to a city government, but it is not automatic. Villages are governed by a board of trustees.

<text>Montana is a state located in the Western United States. According to the 2020 United States Census, Montana is the 8th least populous state with inhabitants but the 4th largest by land area spanning of land. Montana is divided into 56 counties and contains 129 municipalities consisting of cities and towns. Montana&#x27;s municipalities cover only of the state&#x27;s land mass but are home to of its population. The Montana Code 7-1-4124 gives municipal governments in Montana powers to enact ordinances, borrow money, and enact eminent domain among other legal powers.

In Montana, municipalities are divided into four classes by state statute based on their population. Members of the three largest classes are deemed cities, while the members of the fourth class are called towns. Cities and towns are classified at the time of their organization, and are reorganized when they change classification due to an increase or decrease in population. A place may incorporate as a town with the support of 300 electors or two-thirds of the registered electors. A municipality with a population between 1,000 and 5,000 people is a Third Class city. A municipality with a population between 5,000 and 10,000 people is a Second Class city. And a municipality with a population over 10,000 people is a First Class city. Under certain exceptions municipalities with a population of between 9,000 and 10,000 may elect by resolution to be either a First or Second Class city. Under similar exceptions municipalities with a population of between 5,000 and 7,500 may elect by resolution to be either a Second or Third Class city. Municipalities with a population of between 1,000 and 2,500 may by resolution be classified as either a town or Third Class city. Unincorporated places such as census-designated places fall outside this scheme, and are subject to county governance, and thus are not towns or cities.

The largest municipality by population in Montana is Billings with 117,116 residents, and the smallest municipality by population is Ismay with 17 residents. The largest municipality by land area is Anaconda, a consolidated city-county, which spans , while Rexford and Flaxville are the smallest at .

<text>Prick Up Your Ears is a 1987 British film, directed by Stephen Frears, about the playwright Joe Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell. The screenplay was written by Alan Bennett, based on the 1978 biography by John Lahr. The film stars Gary Oldman as Orton, Alfred Molina as Halliwell, Wallace Shawn as Lahr, and Vanessa Redgrave as Peggy Ramsay.

==Plot==
Islington, 9 August 1967. Literary agent Peggy Ramsay knocks on the door of playwright Joe Orton and his lover Kenneth Halliwell, but nobody opens. She calls the police. They find the corpses of the two men. A decade later theatre critic John Lahr visits Peggy Ramsay because he wants to write Orton&#x27;s biography. They find Orton&#x27;s diaries, and Peggy tells Lahr about Orton&#x27;s life.

Orton and Halliwell&#x27;s relationship began at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. Orton started out as the uneducated youth to Halliwell&#x27;s older faux-sophisticate. As the relationship progressed, however, Orton grew increasingly confident in his talent while Halliwell&#x27;s writing stagnated. They fell into a parody of a traditional married couple, with Orton as the &quot;husband&quot; and Halliwell as the long-suffering and increasingly-ignored &quot;wife&quot; (a situation exacerbated at a time when being a sexually active homosexual was illegal). Orton was commissioned to write a screenplay for the Beatles. Halliwell got carried away in preparing for a meeting with the &quot;Fab Four&quot;, but Orton was taken away for a meeting on his own. Finally, in August 1967, a despondent Halliwell kills Orton and commits suicide.

==Cast==
===Casting===
Ian McKellen was originally envisioned as Halliwell. McKellen explained: &quot;I needed a holiday – I&#x27;d been working so hard – so I just kept saying &#x27;no, no, no&#x27;, but when I saw the film I really regretted not having done it.&quot; Maggie Smith turned down the role of Ramsay, saying that she did not want to perturb her sons by starring in a film that featured homosexual promiscuity and murder. Keith Allen was in talks to play Orton before Oldman was cast.

==Reception==
&quot;Prick Up Your Ear&quot;s has a 92% rating at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 39 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10.

Roger Ebert awarded &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot; four stars out of four, describing Redgrave&#x27;s performance as &quot;superb&quot;, and praising the work of Oldman and Molina: &quot;The great performances in the movie are, of course, at its center. Gary Oldman plays Orton, and Alfred Molina plays Halliwell, and these are two of the best performances of the year... [Oldman] is the best young British actor around&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; noted: &quot;The script is witty, the direction fluid, with one of the homosexual orgy scenes in a public toilet almost balletic, and the depiction of the lovers&#x27; life in their flat suitably claustrophobic.&quot;

Vincent Canby was less enthused, writing: &quot;The film covers the main events of the Orton life in a manner that is nothing less than distracted. One has little understanding of the fatal intensity – and need – that kept Orton and Halliwell together.&quot; He nevertheless had praise for the film&#x27;s acting. Similarly, Pauline Kael lauded Redgrave but said the male relationship was unconvincing and suffused with &quot;modern-style psychosexual moralizing&quot;, and that &quot;unlike Orton, it [the script] takes no real delight in misbehaving.&quot;

Oldman earned a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actor; Redgrave received BAFTA and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Redgrave won Best Supporting Actress at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards. Alan Bennett earned a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was also nominated for Best Foreign Film at the 1987 Independent Spirit Awards and won the award for Best Artistic Contribution at that year&#x27;s Cannes Film Festival.

<text>Lanoe George Hawker, (30 December 1890 – 23 November 1916) was a British flying ace of the First World War. Having seven credited victories, he was the third pilot to receive the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry awarded to British and Commonwealth servicemen.

He was killed in a dogfight with the famous German flying ace Manfred von Richthofen (&quot;The Red Baron&quot;), who described him as &quot;the British Boelcke&quot;.

==Early life==
Hawker was born on 30 December 1890 at Longparish, Hampshire, England, to Lieutenant Henry Colley Hawker, R.N., and Julia Gordon Lanoe Hawker, daughter of Major Peter William Lanoe Hawker, of the 74th Highlanders and sister of the author Mary Elizabeth Hawker (&quot;Lanoe Falconer&quot;). His parents were distant cousins; Hawker&#x27;s father was of a cadet branch of the family resident in Australia since his own father, George Charles Hawker (son of Royal Navy Admiral Edward Hawker), emigrated in 1839, being elected Speaker of the House of Assembly, South Australia in 1860. The Hawker family had a military tradition, with army commissions being held in each generation since the time of Elizabeth I. A first cousin was Arthur Bagot, a naval officer in the First World War and Albert Medal recipient.

Lanoe was sent to Stubbington House School and at the age of 11 to the Royal Navy College in Dartmouth, but although highly intelligent and an enthusiastic sportsman, he suffered from a weak constitution, which led to jaundice. With the strenuous nature of a naval career unsuitable, he entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich before joining the Royal Engineers as an officer cadet. A clever inventor, Hawker developed a keen interest in all mechanical and engineering developments. During the summer of 1910 he saw a film featuring the Wright Flyer and after attending an aircraft flying display at Bournemouth, he quickly found an interest in aviation, learning to fly at his own expense at Hendon. On 4 March 1913, Hawker was awarded Aviator&#x27;s Certificate No. 435 by the Royal Aero Club.

Promoted to 1st Lieutenant in October 1913 he was posted to Cork Harbour with the 33rd Fortress Company. His request for attachment to the Royal Flying Corps was granted and he reported to the Central Flying School at Upavon on 1 August 1914, three days before Britain entered the First World War.

Hawker was posted to France in October 1914, as a captain with No. 6 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, flying Henri Farmans. The squadron converted to the B.E.2c and he undertook numerous reconnaissance missions into 1915, being wounded once by ground fire. On 22 April he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for attacking a German zeppelin shed at Gontrode by dropping hand grenades at low level (below 200 ft) from his B.E.2c. He used a tethered German balloon to help shield him from enemy ground fire as he made successive attacks. During the Second Battle of Ypres, Hawker was wounded in the foot by ground fire. For the remainder of the battle he had to be carried to and from his aircraft, but refused to be grounded until the fight was over.

He returned to 6 Squadron after hospitalisation. The squadron received several single-seat scouts, and some early F.E.2 &#x27;pushers&#x27;. One aircraft received was a Bristol Scout C, with RFC s/n 1609 that Hawker, with assistance from Air Mechanic Ernest Elton (who later became an ace himself), equipped with their design of Lewis gun mount, enabling the machine gun to fire forward obliquely at an acute horizontal angle to the axis of flight, missing the propeller arc.

While with No 6 squadron in 1915, Captain Hawker was a comrade of Captain Louis Strange. The Squadron became pioneers of many aspects in military aviation at the time, driven largely by the imagination of Strange and the engineering talents of Hawker. Their talents led to various mountings for Lewis machine guns, one of which won Hawker the Victoria Cross, and one that nearly cost Strange his life.

Hawker&#x27;s innovative ideas at this time greatly benefited the fledgling RFC. He helped to invent the Prideaux disintegrating link machine-gun belt feed, and initiated the practice of putting fabric protective coverings on the tips of wooden propellers, the use of fur-lined thigh boots, and devising a primitive &#x27;rocking fuselage&#x27; for target practice on the ground. In 1916 he also developed (with W.L. French) the increased capacity 97-round &#x27;double drum&#x27; for the Lewis machine gun. It was issued for trials in July and after modifications was issued generally to the RFC and RNAS.

==Victoria Cross==
Following an initial air victory in June, on 25 July 1915 when on patrol over Passchendaele, Captain Hawker attacked three German aircraft in succession, flying a different Bristol Scout C, serial No. 1611, after his earlier No. 1609 had been written off, transplanting the custom Lewis gun mount onto No. 1611. The first aerial victory for Hawker that day occurred after he had emptied a complete drum of bullets from his aircraft&#x27;s single Lewis machine gun into it, sending it spinning down. The second was driven to the ground damaged, and the third – an Albatros C.I of FFA 3 – which he attacked at a height of about 10,000 feet, burst into flames and crashed. (Pilot Oberleutnant Uebelacker and observer Hauptmann Roser were both killed.) For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross, as the third military pilot (and the first fighter pilot) to receive the Victoria Cross (VC), following William Barnard Rhodes-Moorhouse&#x27;s pioneering award for bravery during a bombing raid, and Reginald Warneford&#x27;s award for an anti-Zeppelin attack on an airborne &quot;Deutsches Heer&quot; airship, using aerial bombing to bring it down.

This particular sortie was just one of the many which Captain Hawker undertook during almost a year of constant operational flying and fighting. He claimed at least three more victories in August 1915, either in the Scout or an F.E.2.

Hawker was posted back to England in late 1915, with some seven victory claims (including one captured, three destroyed, one &#x27;out of control&#x27; and one &#x27;forced to land&#x27;), making him the first British flying ace, and a figure of considerable fame within the ranks of the RFC.

It has since been argued that shooting down three aircraft in one mission was a feat repeated several times by later pilots, and whether Hawker deserved his Victoria Cross has been questioned. However, in the context of the air war of mid-1915 it was unusual to shoot down even one aircraft, and the VC was awarded on the basis that all the enemy planes were armed with machine guns. More significantly, by the early summer of 1915, the German &quot;Feldflieger Abteilung&quot; two-seater observation units of the future &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;, had by this time, received examples of the Fokker Eindecker monoplane, with one Eindecker going to each unit, with a fixed, forward-firing machine gun fitted with a &quot;synchronization gear&quot; that prevented the bullets from striking the propeller. The first claim using this arrangement, though unconfirmed by the German Army, was by &quot;Leutnant&quot; Kurt Wintgens on 1 July 1915, some over Lunéville distant from where Hawker had his three-victory success nearly a month later. Therefore, the German pilots like Wintgens and &quot;Leutnant&quot; Otto Parschau, another pioneering Eindecker pilot, could employ the simple combat tactic of aiming the whole aircraft, and presenting a small target to the enemy while approaching from any angle, preferably from a blind spot where the enemy observer could not return fire.

Hawker flew before Britain had any workable synchroniser gear, so his Bristol Scout had its machine gun mounted on the left side of the cockpit, firing forwards and sideways at a 45 degree angle to avoid the propeller. The only direction from which he could attack an enemy was from its right rear quarter – precisely in a direction from which it was easy for the observer to fire at him. Thus, in each of the three attacks, Hawker was directly exposed to the fire of an enemy machine gun.

==First Fighter Squadron==

Promoted to major early in 1916. Hawker was placed in command of the RFC&#x27;s first (single seater) fighter squadron, Number 24 based at Hounslow Heath Aerodrome and flying the Airco DH.2 pusher. After two fatalities in recent flying accidents, the new fighter, which featured a forward-mounted Lewis machine gun, soon earned a reputation for spinning; its rear mounted rotary engine and sensitive controls made it very responsive. Hawker countered this worry by taking a DH.2 up over the squadron base and, in front of the squadron pilots, put the aircraft through a series of spins, each time recovering safely. After landing, he carefully described to all pilots the correct procedures to recover from a spin. Once the pilots became used to the DH.2&#x27;s characteristics, confidence in the aircraft rose quickly, as they came to appreciate its manoeuvrability.

He then led the squadron back to Bertangles, north of the Somme in February 1916, where the squadron quickly helped counter the Fokker Eindecker monoplanes of the Imperial German Army&#x27;s &quot;Fliegertruppe&quot; which were dominant over the Western Front in the run up to the Somme offensive in July 1916. Hawker&#x27;s aggressive personal philosophy of &quot;Attack Everything&quot;, was the entire text of his tactical order of 30 June 1916. Spurred by his aggressiveness, 24 Squadron claimed some 70 victories by November at the cost of 12 of its own planes and 21 pilots killed, wounded or missing.
Around this time, Hawker developed a ring gunsight and created a clamp and spring-clip device to hold the Lewis in place on the DH.2. He also designed sheepskin boots that reached to the upper thigh, known as &quot;fug-boots,&quot; which became standard issue to combat the risk of frostbite at high altitude.

By mid 1916, RFC policy was to ban squadron commanders from operational flying, Hawker included. However, he continued to make frequent offensive patrols and reconnaissance flights, particularly over the Somme battlefields.

As the year wore on, the Germans introduced far more potent fighters to the front, starting with the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;″s first biplane fighter, the single-gun armed Halberstadt D.II, and shortly thereafter the even more advanced, twin-gunned Albatros D.I, rapidly making the DH.2 obsolete.

==Death==

On 23 November 1916, while flying an Airco DH.2 (Serial No. 5964), Hawker left Bertangles Aerodrome at 1300 hours as part of &#x27;A&#x27; Flight, led by Captain (later Air Vice Marshal) J. O. Andrews and including Lieutenant (later Air Marshal) R.H.M.S Saundby. Andrews led the flight in an attack on two German aircraft over Achiet. Spotting a larger flight of German aircraft above, Andrews was about to break off the attack, but spotted Hawker diving to attack. Andrews and Saundby followed him to back him up in his fight; Andrews drove off one of the Germans attacking Hawker, then took bullets in his engine and glided out of the fight under Saundby&#x27;s covering fire. 

Losing contact with the other DH.2s, Hawker began a lengthy dogfight with an Albatros D.II flown by &quot;Leutnant&quot; Manfred von Richthofen of Jasta 2. The Albatros was faster than the DH.2, more powerful and, with a pair of lMG 08 machine guns, more heavily armed. Richthofen fired 900 rounds during the running battle. Running low on fuel, Hawker eventually broke away from the combat and attempted to return to Allied lines. The Red Baron&#x27;s guns jammed 50 yards from the lines, but a bullet from his last burst struck Hawker in the back of his head, killing him instantly. His plane spun from and crashed east of Luisenhof Farm, just south of Bapaume on the Flers Road, becoming the German ace&#x27;s 11th victim. 

German Grenadiers reported burying Hawker east of Luisenhof Farm along the roadside.Richthofen claimed Hawker&#x27;s Lewis gun from the wreck as a trophy and hung it above the door of his quarters. Similar to Georges Guynemer and Werner Voss gravesites Hawker battlefield gravesite was lost; Major Lanoe George Hawker is listed on the Arras Flying Services Memorial for airmen lost with no known grave.

==Legacy==

Hawker&#x27;s original Victoria Cross was lost when the Hawker family belongings were left behind after the fall of France in 1940. On their return after the Second World War, they found that their possessions, including the VC, had been stolen. A replacement was issued to Hawker&#x27;s brother on 3 February 1960, and is now held by the Royal Air Force Museum, Hendon.

A window (designed by Francis Skeat) commemorating Hawker was installed in St Nicholas church, Longparish in 1967. The design features St Michael above an airfield with two pilots in the foreground. A copy of the window is in the Army Flying Museum at Middle Wallop.

A memorial to Hawker was unveiled in the village of Ligny Thilloy, one km from where he crashed and was buried, on 11 November 2011. It was erected by XXIV Squadron, Royal Air Force, beside the village war memorial. 

Hawker was portrayed by Corin Redgrave in the 1971 film &quot;Von Richthofen and Brown&quot;. In the 2008 film &quot;The Red Baron&quot;, he was played by Richard Krajčo.

<doc id="535537" wikidata="Q1386146" url="?curid=535537" title="Albert Hourani">
<text>Albert Habib Hourani, ( &quot;Albart Ḥabīb Ḥūrānī&quot;; 31 March 1915 – 17 January 1993) was a liberal Lebanese British historian, specialising in the history of the Middle East and Middle Eastern studies. 

==Background and education==
Hourani was born in Manchester, England, the son of Soumaya Rassi and Fadlo Hourani, immigrants from Marjeyoun in what is now South Lebanon (see Lebanese diaspora). Fadlo had studied at what later became the American University of Beirut and settled in Manchester as a cotton merchant. Albert&#x27;s brothers were George Hourani, philosopher, historian, and classicist, and Cecil Hourani, economic adviser to President of Tunisia Habib Bourguiba. His family had converted from Eastern Orthodoxy to Scottish Presbyterianism and his father became an elder of the local church in Manchester. Hourani himself, in turn, converted to Catholicism in adulthood. Fadlo had extensive business contacts with the Levantine community both in Manchester and in the Ottoman Empire, and Cecil Hourani commented on the household&#x27;s mixed Anglo-Levantine culture:

&quot;... to my earliest memories in Manchester there were two faces: the one Near Eastern, Lebanese, full of poetry, politics, and business; the other partly Scottish Presbyterian, full of Sunday church-going and Sunday school, partly English through an English nanny and a succession of English and Irish cooks and maids.&quot; 

Fadlo Hourani tried to enroll Albert into a preparatory school in Manchester but it did not accept him as it did not take &#x27;foreigners&#x27;; Fadlo instead opened an alternative school in which Albert studied until the age of fourteen. He later studied at Mill Hill School, London before attending Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied Philosophy, Politics, Economics and History (with an emphasis on international relations in the politics section of the degree), graduating first in his class in 1936.

The academic H. A. R. Gibb was among his mentors. 

==Career==
He taught in 1938–39 at the American University of Beirut, the first time he had lived in an Arabic speaking country
In World War II he worked at the Royal Institute of International Affairs (aka Chatham House) and in the office of the British Minister of State in Cairo. When in Cairo, Hourani rented a room in Paul Kraus&#x27;s house; in 1944 Kraus was found hanged in his bathroom for an alleged suicide.

After the war&#x27;s end, he worked at the Arab Office in Jerusalem and London, where he helped prepare the Arab case for the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry. Although he developed a liberal Arab nationalist sensibility as his education about the Middle East deepened, Hourani described himself as originally an unquestioning English liberal.

He began his academic career, which would occupy the rest of his life, in 1948, teaching at Magdalen College, St. Antony&#x27;s College (where he created and directed the college&#x27;s Middle East Centre), the American University of Beirut, the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard. He ended his academic career as Fellow of St. Antony&#x27;s and Reader in the History of the Modern Middle East at Oxford. Hourani trained more academic historians of the modern Middle East than any other university historian of his generation. Today his students can be found on the faculties of LSE, Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia, MIT and the University of Haifa, among others.
He was appointed CBE in the 1980 Birthday Honours.

==Influence on Middle Eastern studies==
According to historian Rashid Khalidi (quoted from within a series of essays gathered originally for a conference in Hourani&#x27;s honor), &quot;Hourani&#x27;s students, and their students, have over the last few decades effectively populated and then produced the core of the field of modern Middle East history in North America and Europe, and parts of the Middle East and other regions as well (2016)&quot;.

Hourani&#x27;s most popular work is &quot;A History of the Arab Peoples&quot; (1991), a readable introduction to the history of the Middle East and an international best seller. &quot;Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age 1789–1939&quot; (1962) is one of the first scientific attempts at a comprehensive analysis of the &quot;nahda&quot;, the Arab revival of the 19th century, and the opening of the Arab world to modern European culture; it remains one of the major works on this subject. &quot;Syria and Lebanon. A Political Essay&quot; (1946) and &quot;Minorities in the Arab World&quot; (1947) are other major works. He also wrote extensive works on the orientalist perspective on Middle Eastern cultures through the 18th and 19th centuries, and he developed the influential concept of the &quot;urban notables&quot; – political and social elites in provincial Middle Eastern cities and towns that served as intermediaries between imperial capitals (such as Istanbul under the Ottoman Turks) and provincial society.

The top book prize in the Middle Eastern studies field is named the Albert Hourani Book Award and it is given annually by the Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA). Hourani was an Honorary Fellow of both MESA and the American Historical Association (AHA).

Among his students are Abbas Amanat, Nazih Ayubi, Aziz al-Azmeh, Michael Gilsenan, Rashid Khalidi, Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid Marsot, Roger Owen, Ilan Pappé, and André Raymond (and others).

==Personal life==

In 1955 Hourani married Christine Mary Odile Wegg-Prosser (1914–2003), while teaching at Magdalen College, Oxford. He died in Oxford in 1993 at the age of 77. His widow died in 2003 at the age of 89. Both are buried in Wolvercote Cemetery in Oxford.

They had a daughter, Susanna Hourani, who became professor of pharmacology and Head of Department in the School of Biomedical and Molecular Sciences of the University of Surrey.

<text>Teléfonos de México,
S.A.B. de C.V., known as Telmex is a Mexican telecommunications company headquartered in Mexico City that provides telecommunications products and services in Mexico. In 2014, Telmex was the dominant fixed-line phone carrier in Mexico. In addition to traditional fixed-line telephone service, Telmex offers Internet access through their Infinitum brand of Wi-Fi networks, data, hosted services and IT services. Telmex owns 90 percent of the telephone lines in Mexico City and 80 percent of the lines in the country. Telmex is a wholly owned subsidiary of América Móvil.

== History ==

Telmex was founded in Mexico the , when a group of Mexican investors bought Swedish Ericsson&#x27;s Mexican branch. In 1950, the same investors bought the Mexican branch of the ITT Corporation, thus becoming the only telephone provider in the country. In 1972, the Mexican government bought the company.

In 1990, Telmex was bought by a group of investors formed principally by Carlos Slim Helú, France Télécom, and Southwestern Bell Corporation, whose tender was the largest. However, controversially, the payment itself took place over the course of the next several years, using revenues from the phone service.

After privatization, Telmex began investing in new modern infrastructure, creating a partial fiber optic network throughout the nation, thus offering service to 30% of the Mexican territory.

In 1991, the Mexican government sold its remaining stock in Telmex.

==Cellphone mobile unit==

In the 1990s, Telmex formed a subsidiary Radio Móvil Dipsa to provide mobile communications under the brand Telcel.

In 2000, Telmex spun off their mobile unit, creating América Móvil, which controls Radio Móvil Dipsa. It started with 80% of the mobile market.

In 2010, America Móvil (an independent company from its former parent company, Telmex) bought 60% of Telmex, paying over 23 billion dollars. In 2011, America Móvil purchased the remaining 40% of Telmex. In August 2012, America Móvil started the process to de-list Telmex from the Mexican Stock Exchange.

==Internet==

In the mid-1990s, Telmex began providing Internet access as an Internet service provider (ISP) with the brand Uninet. A year later, the brand was changed to Telmex Internet Directo Personal (Telmex Direct Personal Internet). In 1996, Telmex bought Prodigy Communications and took the brand to Mexico, renaming the service Prodigy Internet de Telmex. Thanks to their national coverage, Telmex rapidly became the leading national ISP. , Telmex holds more than 80% of the market as an ISP, and is also the leader in broadband access with its brand Prodigy Infinitum (ADSL).

In 2001, Telmex sold the U.S. branch of Prodigy Communications to SBC, which was dubbed SBC Prodigy. However, Telmex continues to own and operate Prodigy in Mexico. In 2004, Telmex claimed that the number of users of Prodigy Internet grew by 190%.

Telmex dropped the Prodigy name from its advertising in 2009, replacing it with the &quot;Infinitum&quot; brand of Telmex internet services since that year. The name Prodigy is still used in the Mexican local site of MSN.

==Television==

Telmex owns TV UNO and Claro Sports.

==Long-distance competition==
In the mid-1990s, AT&amp;T Corporation and WorldCom (MCI), among others, began operating in Mexico, representing for the first time serious competition to Telmex.

==Expansion==

After spinning off América Móvil, Telmex started an expansion plan, which started with the purchase of Guatemala&#x27;s Telgua. Later, Telmex bought former state-owned phone companies in Central America, and began operations in the US with Telmex USA.

In 2004, Telmex went into a shopping spree for undervalued operators in South America, including the purchase of AT&amp;T&#x27;s Latin American operations, giving it presence in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, and increased reach in the United States. In the same year, Telmex bought from MCI Brazil&#x27;s largest and most important long-distance operator, Embratel, acquired Chile&#x27;s Chilesat, took control of Argentina&#x27;s Techtel (operating in Argentina and Uruguay), of which it already owned 60%, by purchasing the remaining 40% from the Techint group, and purchased Argentina&#x27;s Metrored. In the US, Telmex bought 13.4% of bankrupt MCI.

At the same time, sister company America Movil pursued a similar strategy by acquiring cellular operators CTI Movil in Argentina and Uruguay, Claro in Brazil and Peru, Porta in Ecuador and Comcel in Colombia.

In 2005, Telmex sold its holdings in MCI to Verizon.

As of January 2006, Telmex continued buying assets in Latin America and in the USA.
In March 2006, there were rumors that Telmex was buying Verizon operations in the Caribbean. The reports said that the operation can include the wireless operation on each market. The total amount of this sale was estimated at nearly US$300 million.

In November 2006, an American embassy cable listed Telmex as among &quot;Mexico&#x27;s monopolists&quot;, with a 95% share of landlines. Its sister company Telcel was listed with a market share of 80% of cellular service.
In December 2006, Telmex announced agreement to acquire TV Cable and Cable Pacifico in Colombia. TV Cable offers cable television, Internet and Voice over IP services and has been in operation for 20 years. , the company serves 164,000 homes in Bogotá and Cali. Cable Pacifico serves nine states and its main operation is in Medellín. , Cable Pacifico has approximately 100,000 subscribers.

In January 2007, America Movil bought the Verizon operations in Puerto Rico, and days later Telmex and America Movil announced that their equally owned joint venture had agreed with Verizon Communications Inc. (&quot;Verizon&quot;) to terminate the joint venture&#x27;s agreement to acquire Verizon&#x27;s indirect equity interests in Compañía Anónima Nacional Teléfonos de Venezuela (CANTV); subsequently, all of Verizon&#x27;s holdings in CANTV were acquired in May 2007 by the Venezuelan government, reaching 86.2% of its total shares.

In January 2007, Telmex launched Prodigy Media, the first step to offer triple play services to the Mexican market. Days later, Telmex started the first Wi-Max network in Chile, offering local, long-distance and Internet services to 98% of the Chilean population.

In March 2007, Telmex bought Ecutel, a small telecommunications company in Ecuador that offers services to the corporate market.

In April 2007, Telmex announced agreement to acquire CABLECENTRO and SATELCARIBE in Colombia.
CABLECENTRO offers cable TV and Internet access services and has been in operation for 7 years. Currently, the company operates in more than 50 cities in Colombia including Bogota, Cucuta, Bucaramanga, Ibague and Neiva, among others.
SATELCARIBE offers cable TV and Internet access services and has been in operation for 7 years. Currently, the company operates in more than 15 cities in Colombia.

In December 2007, Telmex transferred its Latin American and yellow pages directory businesses to a new, separate entity, Telmex Internacional.

==América Móvil takeover==

In January 2010, América Móvil, the largest mobile phone company in Latin America, made an offer to buy Telmex and Telmex International in order to better compete against Spain&#x27;s Telefonica and Malaysia&#x27;s Telekom Malaysia. The acquisition was approved by the CFC (Comisión Federal de Competencia) Antitrust Office in Mexico on February 11, 2010.

América Móvil was once the mobile arm of Telmex, but in 2001, América Móvil was split off and grew larger than the former parent company.

<text>Babeldaob (also Babelthuap) is the largest island in the island nation of the Republic of Palau. It is in the western Caroline Islands, and the second largest island (after Guam) in the Micronesia region of Oceania. Palau&#x27;s capital, Ngerulmud, is located on Babeldaob, in Melekeok State.

Babeldaob is one of the most underdeveloped populated islands in the Pacific Ocean. The area of Babeldaob, , makes up over 70% of the land area of the entire Republic of Palau. It has about 30% of the country&#x27;s population, with about 6,000 people living on it.

==Geography==
Babeldaob is located northeast of Koror Island, and its northern portion contains the site of the new national capital, Ngerulmud. The southern end of the island is in Airai State, Palau&#x27;s second-most populous state. The Airai Airport on the island is the nation&#x27;s principal airport.

The Koror-Babeldaob Bridge links Babeldaob Island at Airai to Koror Island.

Unlike most of the islands of Palau, Babeldaob is mountainous. It contains Palau&#x27;s highest point, the -tall Mount Ngerchelchuus. Babeldaob&#x27;s eastern coast has many sandy beaches, in particular north from Melekeok to Ngaraard, and the island&#x27;s western coast has a shoreline with many mangrove forests.

Of the 16 states of Palau, Babeldaob encompasses 10, which are:
*Aimeliik
*Airai
*Melekeok
*Ngaraard
*Ngarchelong
*Ngardmau
*Ngatpang
*Ngchesar
*Ngeremlengui
*Ngiwal

==Environment==
===Important Bird Areas===
The central forested Middle Ridge of Babeldaob encompasses the headwaters of most of the island’s watersheds. Some 13,767 ha in area, it has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of most of Palau’s endemic birds, including Micronesian megapodes, Palau ground doves, Micronesian imperial pigeons, Palau fruit doves, swiftlets, owls and kingfishers, Micronesian myzomelas, morningbirds, Palau fantails, flycatchers and bush warblers, dusky and citrine white-eyes, and Micronesian starlings. The Western Ridge IBA adjoins Middle Ridge in the north-west of the island. This 2,608 ha site contains populations of the same bird species, as does the 1,135 ha Ngerutechei IBA on the western side of the island, which also includes riverine mangrove habitat.

==History==
First sighting of Babeldaob, Koror and Peleliu recorded by Europeans was by the Spanish expedition of Ruy López de Villalobos at the end of January 1543. They were then charted as &quot;Los Arrecifes&quot; (&quot;The Reefs&quot; in Spanish). In November and December 1710 these three islands were again visited and explored by the Spanish missionary expedition commanded by Sargento Mayor Francisco Padilla on board of the patache &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;. Two years later they were explored in detail by the expedition of Spanish naval officer Bernardo de Egoy. It was in the Spanish East Indies from 1686 to 1899.

As a consequence of the Spanish–American War, Spain sold Palau (including Babeldaob), the Carolines and the Northern Marianas (except Guam) to the German Empire for 17 million goldmark pursuant to the German–Spanish Treaty (1899). The newly acquired islands were administered from German New Guinea. Babeldaob was the destination to which the 426 members of the Sokehs tribe were banished by colonial authorities following the Sokehs Rebellion on Sokehs Island and Pohnpei.

In the early months of World War I, Imperial Japan occupied all German islands north of the equator. As a League of Nations mandatory power after the war, Japan returned the Sokehs to Pohnpei in stages between 1917 and 1927.

During World War II a Japanese garrison on Babeldaob was composed of 21,449 Imperial Japanese Army men under the command of Lieutenant-General Sadae Inoue and 8,286 Imperial Japanese Navy men under the command of Vice-Admiral Kenmi Itoh. Allied forces bypassed Babeldaob during the war.

<text>A bumper is a structure attached to or integrated with the front and rear ends of a motor vehicle, to absorb impact in a minor collision, ideally minimizing repair costs. Stiff metal bumpers appeared on automobiles as early as 1904 that had a mainly ornamental function. Numerous developments, improvements in materials and technologies, as well as greater focus on functionality for protecting vehicle components and improving safety have changed bumpers over the years. Bumpers ideally minimize height mismatches between vehicles and protect pedestrians from injury. Regulatory measures have been enacted to reduce vehicle repair costs and, more recently, impact on pedestrians.

==History==
Bumpers were, at first, just rigid metal bars. George Albert Lyon invented the earliest car bumper. The first bumper appeared on a vehicle in 1897, and Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft, an Austrian carmaker, installed it. The construction of these bumpers was unreliable as they featured only a cosmetic function. Early car owners had the front spring hanger bolt replaced with ones long enough to attach a metal bar. G.D. Fisher patented a bumper bracket to simplify the attachment of the accessory. The first bumper designed to absorb impacts appeared in 1901. It was made of rubber, and Frederick Simms gained a patent in 1905.
Automakers added bumpers in the mid-1910s, but consisted of a strip of steel across the front and back. Often treated as an optional accessory, bumpers became more and more common in the 1920s as automobile designers made them more complex and substantial. Over the next decades, chrome-plated bumpers became heavy, elaborative, and increasingly decorative until the late 1950s when U.S. automakers began establishing new bumper trends and brand-specific designs. The 1960s saw the use of lighter chrome-plated blade-like bumpers with a painted metal valance filling the space below it. Multi-piece construction became the norm as automakers incorporated grilles, lighting, and even rear exhaust into the bumpers.

On the 1968 Pontiac GTO, General Motors incorporated an &quot;Endura&quot; body-colored plastic front bumper designed to absorb low-speed impact without permanent deformation. It was featured in a TV advertisement with John DeLorean hitting the bumper with a sledgehammer and no damage resulted. Similar elastomeric bumpers were available on the front and rear of the 1970-71 Plymouth Barracuda. In 1971, Renault introduced a plastic bumper (sheet moulding compound) on the Renault 5.

Current design practice is for the bumper structure on modern automobiles to consist of a plastic cover over a reinforcement bar made of steel, aluminum, fiberglass composite, or plastic. Bumpers of most modern automobiles have been made of a combination of polycarbonate (PC) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) called PC/ABS.

==Physics==
Bumpers offer protection to other vehicle components by dissipating the kinetic energy generated by an impact. This energy is a function of vehicle mass and velocity squared. The kinetic energy is equal to 1/2 the product of the mass and the square of the speed. In formula form:

:formula_1

A bumper that protects vehicle components from damage at 5 miles per hour must be four times as tough as a bumper that protects at 2.5 miles per hour, with the collision energy dissipation concentrated at the extreme front and rear of the vehicle. Small increases in bumper protection can lead to weight gain and loss of fuel efficiency.

Until 1959, rigidity was seen as beneficial to occupant safety among automotive engineers. Modern theories of vehicle crashworthiness point in the opposite direction, towards vehicles that crumple progressively. A completely rigid vehicle might have excellent bumper protection for vehicle components, but would offer poor occupant safety.

==Pedestrian safety==
Bumpers are increasingly being designed to mitigate injury to pedestrians struck by cars, such as through the use of bumper covers made of flexible materials. Front bumpers, especially, have been lowered and made of softer materials, such as foams and crushable plastics, to reduce the severity of impact on legs.

==Height mismatches==

For passenger cars, the height and placement of bumpers are legally specified under both U.S. and EU regulations. Bumpers do not protect against moderate-speed collisions, because during emergency braking, suspension changes the pitch of each vehicle, so bumpers can bypass each other when the vehicles collide. Preventing override and underride can be accomplished by extremely tall bumper surfaces. Active suspension is another solution to keeping the vehicle level.

Bumper height from the roadway surface is essential in engaging other protective systems. Airbag deployment sensors typically do not trigger until contact with an obstruction, and it is crucial that front bumpers be the first parts of a vehicle to make contact in the event of a frontal collision, to leave sufficient time to inflate the protective cushions.

Energy-absorbing crush zones are completely ineffective if they are physically bypassed; an extreme example of this occurs when the elevated platform of a tractor-trailer completely misses the front bumper of a passenger car, and the first contact is with the glass windshield of the passenger compartment.

===Truck vs. car===
Underride collisions, in which a smaller vehicle such as a passenger sedan slides under a larger vehicle such as a tractor-trailer often result in severe injuries or fatalities. The platform bed of a typical tractor-trailer is at the head height of seated adults in a typical passenger car and thus can cause severe head trauma in even a moderate-speed collision. Around 500 people are killed this way in the United States annually.

Following the June 1967 death of actress Jayne Mansfield in an auto/truck accident, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommended requiring a rear underride guard, also known as a &quot;Mansfield bar&quot;, an &quot;ICC bar&quot;, or a &quot;DOT (Department of Transportation) bumper&quot;. These may not be more than from the road. The U.S. trucking industry has been slow to upgrade this safety feature, and there are no requirements to repair ICC bars damaged in service. However, in 1996 NHTSA upgraded the requirements for the rear underride prevention structure on truck trailers, and Transport Canada went further with an even more stringent requirement for energy-absorbing rear underride guards. In July 2015, NHTSA issued a proposal to upgrade the U.S. performance requirements for underride guards.

Many European nations have also required side underride guards to mitigate lethal collisions where the car impacts the truck from the side. A variety of different types of side underride guards of this nature are in use in Japan, the US, and Canada. However, they are not required in the United States.

UN Regulation 58 sets forth requirements for rear underrun protective devices (RUPDs) and their installation, among which is that trucks and trailers of various types must have such devices with height above the ground not more than , , or .

===SUV vs. car===
Mismatches between SUV bumper heights and passenger car side impact beams have allowed serious injuries at relatively low speeds. In the United States, NHTSA is studying how to address this issue .

Beyond lethal interactions, repair costs of passenger car/SUV collisions can also be significant due to the height mismatch. This mismatch can result in vehicles being so severely damaged that they are inoperable after low-speed collisions.

==Regulation==
In most jurisdictions, bumpers are legally required on all vehicles. Regulations for automobile bumpers have been implemented for two reasons – to allow the car to sustain a low-speed impact without damage to the vehicle&#x27;s safety systems, and to protect pedestrians from injury. These requirements conflict: bumpers that withstand impact well and minimize repair costs tend to injure pedestrians more, while pedestrian-friendly bumpers tend to have higher repair costs.

Although a vehicle&#x27;s bumper systems are designed to absorb the energy of low-speed collisions and help protect the car&#x27;s safety and other expensive nearby components, most bumpers are designed to meet only the minimum regulatory standards.

=== International standards ===
International safety regulations, devised initially as European standards under the auspices of the United Nations, have now been adopted by most countries outside North America. These specify that a car&#x27;s safety systems must still function normally after a straight-on pendulum or moving-barrier impact of to the front and the rear, and to the front and rear corners of at above the ground with the vehicle loaded or unloaded.

====Pedestrian safety====
European countries have implemented regulations to address the issue of 270,000 deaths annually in worldwide pedestrian/auto accidents.

====Bull bars====

Specialized bumpers, known as &quot;bull bars&quot; or &quot;roo bars&quot;, protect vehicles in rural environments from collisions with large animals. However, studies have shown that such bars increase the threat of death and serious injury to pedestrians in urban environments, because the bull bar is rigid and transmits all force of a collision to the pedestrian, unlike a bumper, which absorbs some force and crumples. In the European Union, the sale of rigid metal bull bars that do not comply with the relevant pedestrian-protection safety standards has been banned.

====Off-road bumpers====
Off-road vehicles often utilize aftermarket off-road bumpers made of heavy gauge metal to improve clearance (height above terrain), maximize departure angles, clear larger tires, and ensure additional protection. Similar or identical to bull bars, off-road bumpers feature a rigid construction and do not absorb (by plastic deformation) any energy in a collision, which is more dangerous for pedestrians than factory plastic bumpers. The legality of the aftermarket off-road bumpers varies by jurisdiction.

===United States===
Bumper regulations in the United States focus on preventing low-speed accidents from impairing safe vehicle operation, limiting damage to safety-related vehicle components, and containing the costs of repair after a crash.

====First standards 1971====
In 1971, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued the country&#x27;s first regulation applicable to passenger car bumpers. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 215 (FMVSS 215), &quot;Exterior Protection,&quot; took effect on 1 September 1972—when most automakers would begin producing their model year 1973 vehicles. The standard prohibited functional damage to specified safety-related components such as headlamps and fuel system components when the vehicle is subjected to barrier crash tests at for front and for rear bumper systems. The requirements effectively eliminated automobile bumper designs that featured integral automotive lighting components such as tail lamps.

In October 1972, the U.S. Congress enacted the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Saving Act (MVICS), which required NHTSA to issue a bumper standard that yields the &quot;maximum feasible reduction of cost to the public and to the consumer&quot;. Factors considered included the costs and benefits of implementation, the standard&#x27;s effect on insurance costs and legal fees, savings in consumer time and inconvenience, as well as health and safety considerations.

The 1973 model year passenger cars sold in the U.S. used a variety of designs. They ranged from non-dynamic versions with solid rubber guards, to &quot;recoverable&quot; designs with oil and nitrogen filled telescoping shock-absorbers.

The standards were further tightened for the 1974 model year passenger cars, with standardized height front and rear bumpers that could take angle impacts at with no damage to the car&#x27;s lights, safety equipment, and engine. There was no provision in the law for consumers to &#x27;opt out&#x27; of this protection.

====Regulatory effect on design====
The regulations specified bumper performance; they did not prescribe any particular bumper design. Nevertheless, many cars for the U.S. market were equipped with bulky, massive, protruding bumpers to comply with the 5-mile-per-hour bumper standard in effect from 1973 to 1982. This often meant additional overall vehicle length, as well as new front and rear designs to incorporate the stronger energy-absorbing bumpers, adding weight to the extremities of the vehicle. Passenger cars featured gap-concealing flexible filler panels between the bumpers and the car&#x27;s bodywork causing them to have a &quot;massive, blockish look&quot;. However, other bumper designs also met the requirements. The 1973 AMC Matador coupe had free-standing bumpers with rubber gaiters alone to conceal the retractable shock absorbers. &quot;Endura&quot; bumpers, compliant with the regulations yet tightly integrated into the front bodywork, were used on models such as the Pontiac Grand Am starting in 1973 and the Chevrolet Monte Carlo starting in 1978, with significantly lower mass than heavy chromed-steel bumpers with separate impact energy absorbers.

The bumper regulations applied to all passenger cars, both American-made and imported. With exceptions including the Volvo 240, Porsche 911, and Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, European and Asian automakers tended to put compliant bumpers only on cars destined for the U.S. and Canadian markets where the regulations applied. This meant their North American-spec cars tended to look different than versions of the same model sold elsewhere. 
U.S. bumper-height requirements effectively made some models, such as the Citroën SM, ineligible for importation to the United States. Unlike international safety regulations, U.S. regulations were written without provision for hydropneumatic suspension.

====Zero-damage standards 1976====
The requirements promulgated under MVICS were consolidated with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 215 (FMVSS 215, &quot;Exterior Protection of Vehicles&quot;) and promulgated in March 1976. This new bumper standard was placed in the United States Code of Federal Regulations at 49 CFR 581, separate from the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards at 49CFR571. The new requirements, applicable to 1979-model year passenger cars, were called the &quot;Phase I&quot; standard. At the same time, a zero-damage requirement, &quot;Phase II&quot;, was enacted for bumper systems on 1980 and newer cars. The most rigorous requirements applied to 1980 through 1982 model vehicles; front and rear barrier and pendulum crash tests were required, and no damage was allowed to the bumper beyond a dent and displacement from the bumper&#x27;s original position.
All-wheel-drive &quot;cross-over&quot; cars such as the AMC Eagle were classified as multi-purpose vehicles or trucks, and thus exempt from the passenger car bumper standards.

====Stringency reduced in 1982====
The recently elected Reagan administration had pledged to use cost–benefit analysis to reduce regulatory burdens on industry, which impacted this standard.

As discussed in detail under Physics, before 1959, people believed the stronger the structure, including the bumpers, the safer the car. A later analysis led to the understanding of crumple zones, rather than rigid construction that proved deadly to passengers because the force from impact went straight inside the vehicle and onto the passenger.

NHTSA amended the bumper standard in May 1982, halving the front and rear crash test speeds for 1983 and newer car bumpers from to , and the corner crash test speeds from to . In addition, the zero-damage Phase II requirement was rolled back to the damage allowances of Phase I. At the same time, a passenger car bumper height requirement of was established for passenger cars.

NHTSA evaluated the results of its change in 1987, noting it resulted in lower weight and manufacturing costs, offset by higher repair costs.

Despite these findings, consumer and insurance groups decried the weakened bumper standard. They argued that the 1982 standard increased overall consumer costs without any attendant benefits except for automakers. In 1986, Consumers Union petitioned NHTSA to return to the Phase II standard and disclose bumper strength information to consumers. In 1990, NHTSA rejected that petition.

====Consumer information====
In the United States, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) subjects vehicles to low-speed barrier tests () and publishes the results, including repair costs. Car makers that do well in these tests tend to publicize the results.

In 1990, the IIHS conducted four crash tests on three different-year examples of the Plymouth Horizon. The results illustrate the effect of the 
changes to the U.S. bumper regulations (repair costs are quoted in 1990 United States dollars):
* 1983 Horizon with Phase-II 5-mph bumpers: $287
* 1983 Horizon with Phase-I 2.5-mph bumpers: $918
* 1990 Horizon: $1,476

====Bumpers today====
Today&#x27;s bumpers are designed to mitigate injuries to pedestrians and minimize weight at the ends of the vehicle, thereby increasing occupant protection from progressive crumpling in a serious accident. They are no longer made of steel and rubber, but of a plastic outer fascia over a lightweight, impact-absorbing polystyrene foam core.

===Canada===
Automobile bumper standards in Canada were first enacted simultaneously as those in the United States. These were closely similar to the U.S. regulation, and the Canadian requirements were not lowered to in 1982 as was done in the United States.

Some automakers provided stronger Canadian-specification bumpers throughout the North American market, while others chose weaker bumpers in the U.S. market. This limited grey import vehicles between the U.S. and Canada.

In early 2009, Canada&#x27;s regulation shifted to harmonize with U.S. Federal standards and international UN Regulations. As in the U.S., consumer protection groups opposed the change, while Canadian regulators maintained that the test speed is used worldwide and is more compatible with improved pedestrian protection in vehicle-pedestrian crashes.

<text>The Cadillac Seville is a mid-size luxury car manufactured by Cadillac from the 1976 to 2004 model years as a smaller-sized, premium model. It was replaced by the STS in 2004 for the 2005 model year.

==Origin of the name==

The name of &quot;Cadillac&#x27;s first small car&quot; was selected over a revival of LaSalle or the GM design staff&#x27;s preference, LaScala, primarily because, as noted by GM Marketing Director Gordon Horsburgh, &quot;It had no negatives.&quot; The initial suggestion was &quot;Leland&quot; in honor of one of the make&#x27;s founders but it was rejected because most buyers wouldn&#x27;t understand the reference and Henry Leland had also founded rival Lincoln.

Hundreds of suggestions were considered: after extensive research, LaSalle was the top pick with St. Moritz a distant second, trailed further by Seville. A troubled past (LaSalle) and difficult pronunciation (St. Moritz) led to the eventual selection of the &quot;Seville&quot; nameplate.

Seville is the name of a Spanish province and its capital, renowned for its history and treasures of art and architecture. Cadillac had first used the nameplate for a two-door hardtop version of the 1956 Eldorado. 1960 was the last model year for the Eldorado Seville, returning in 1967 under a different name.
== First generation (1976–1979) ==

The Seville, introduced in May 1975 as an early 1976 model, was Cadillac&#x27;s answer to the rising popularity of European luxury imports as Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW. GM planners were becoming concerned that the division&#x27;s once-vaunted image as the &quot;standard of the world&quot; was fading, especially among younger generations of car buyers.

Over time, European luxury cars had become quite luxurious and even more expensive than the much larger Cadillacs. As market share of these imports continued to climb, it became obvious that the traditional American automotive paradigm of &quot;bigger equals better&quot; had begun to falter. The Seville became the smallest and most expensive model in the lineup, turning Cadillac&#x27;s traditional marketing and pricing strategy upside down. Full size design prototypes were created as early as winter of 1972–73 (wearing the tentative name LaSalle, reviving the Cadillac junior brand from 1927 to 1940). Subsequent design prototypes looked edgier (specifically a 1973 named LaScala which forwardly hinted at the 1992 Seville).

Styling took strong cues from the Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow. Cadillac stylists added a crisp, angular body that set the tone for GM styling for the next decade, along with a wide track stance, giving the car a substantial, premium appearance. A wide chrome grille flanked by quadruple rectangular headlamps with narrow parking and signal lamps just below the header panel, while small wrap-around rectangular tail lamps placed at the outermost corners of the rear gave the appearance of a lower, leaner, and wider car. The taillight design was similar to that used on a rejected Coupe DeVille concept.

Unibody construction included a bolt-on subframe with a rear suspension based on the rear-wheel drive 1968–74 X-body platform that underpinned a range of intermediate GM autos. It also featured a rear differential with thicker front subframe bushings similar to the second generation F platform used in the Camaro, Firebird, and the 1975–79 X-body platform. Substantial re-engineering and upgrades from these humble origins earned it the unique designation &quot;K-body&quot; (rather than &quot;X-special&quot; following the format of the A-special Chevrolet Monte Carlo/Pontiac Grand Prix and B-special Buick Riviera). Also shared with the X-body platform was part of the roof stamping and trunk floor pan (for 1973 and newer vehicles).

Seville engineers chose the X-body platform instead of the originally-intended to be used German Opel Diplomat in response to GM&#x27;s budget restrictions—executives felt re-engineering an Opel would be more costly. Another proposal during development was a front-wheel drive layout similar to the Cadillac Eldorado. This proposal was also rejected because of budget concerns since the transaxle used for the Eldorado was produced on a limited basis solely for the E-body (Eldorado/Toronado) and the GMC motorhome of the mid-1970s.

Introduced in mid-1975 and billed as the new &quot;internationally-sized&quot; Cadillac, the Seville was almost lighter than the full-sized Deville. The Seville was thus more nimble and easy to park, as well as retaining a full complement of Cadillac features. More expensive than any other Cadillac (except the Series 75 Fleetwood factory limousines) at US$12,479 ($ in dollars ), the Seville was modestly successful. It spawned several imitators including the Lincoln Versailles and the Chrysler LeBaron (Fifth Avenue after 1982). To ensure the quality of the initial production run, the first 2,000 units produced were identical in color (Georgian silver) and options. This enabled workers to &quot;ramp up&quot; to building different configurations. Total 1976 Seville production was 43,772 vehicles.

Early Sevilles produced between April 1975 (a total of 16,355) to the close of the 1976 model year were the first Cadillacs to use the smaller GM wheel bolt pattern (5 lugs with a bolt circle; the 2003–2009 XLR also uses this pattern). The first Sevilles shared a minority of components with the X-Body. The rear drums measured and were similar to the ones used with the Nova &quot;9C1&quot; (police option) and A-body (Chevelle, Cutlass, Regal, LeMans) intermediate station wagons. Starting with the 1977 model year, production Sevilles used the larger 5-lug bolt circle common to full-size Chevrolet passenger cars (1971–76), Cadillacs, Buicks, Oldsmobiles, Pontiacs, and half-ton Chevrolet/GMC light trucks and vans. It also received rear disc brakes, a design which would surface a year later as an option on the F-body Pontiac Trans Am. 1975–76 models included a vinyl roof, to less expensively cover the roof&#x27;s two part construction, the rear section around the C-pillar was pressed especially for Cadillac and X-body pressing was used for the forward section. Due to customer demand, a painted steel roof was offered in 1977, requiring a new full roof stamping. 1977 Seville production increased slightly to 45,060 vehicles. The last year, production increased to the first generation&#x27;s peak production, at 56,985.

The engine was an Oldsmobile-sourced V8, fitted with a Bendix analog port fuel injection system. This system gave the Seville smooth driveability and performance that was usually lacking in domestic cars of this early emissions control era. Power output was , fuel economy was 15 MPG in the city and 21 MPG on the highway. While standard on Seville, this EFI system was optional on the full size models starting in 1975. Performance was considered good for the era, with zero-to- taking 11.5 seconds. A diesel &quot;LF9&quot; V8 was added in 1978.

For the 1978 and 1979 model years, the Seville offered a trip computer, marketed as &quot;Tripmaster&quot; at an extra cost of $920. The fuel gauge, speedometer and clock were replaced with digital readouts. Gas-discharge display technology was selected due to greater visibility in daylight conditions. A small panel of 12 buttons allowed selection of data to be displayed, such as coolant temp, battery voltage, or fuel range. The driver could also enter initial trip data and the computer would estimate arrival time based on speed and miles remaining. The computer itself was designed around the M6800 architecture and included self-diagnostics. For the 1979 model year, Tripmaster&#x27;s hardware was improved, and the option was made available on the newly downsized Eldorado, which shared the same engine and EFI system as the Seville.

Though preceded by the British 1976 Aston Martin Lagonda sedan, the Seville was the first American automobile to offer full electronic instrumentation. Although the 1978 Continental Mark V was available with a &quot;Miles-To-Empty&quot; feature (i.e., an LED readout of miles left to travel based on the fuel remaining), Lincoln did not offer full electronic instrumentation until 1980. The Tripmaster proved unpopular due to its high price, but it served successfully as an engineering test bed for future embedded electronics in GM vehicles. For 1980, an integrated LED-based &quot;MPG Sentinel&quot; display panel became standard equipment, and a VFD digital speedometer cluster was offered as optional starting in 1981.

A number of custom coach builders made modifications to the 1975–1979 Seville, including shortened 2-seat 2-door convertibles, a 2-door convertible with a back seat, a 2-door pickup truck, 2-door coupes, 2- and 4-door lengthened-hood Sevilles with a fake spare tire in each front fender, and a lengthened-wheelbase standard 4-door Seville. In the late 1970s, Florida coachbuilder, Grandeur Motor Car Company, offered converted Sevilles with neoclassical 1930s styling cues. These sedans were converted into 2-door coupes with an elongated hood, fake spare tire covers on both sides, a small portal window in the rear right section of the vinyl-covered roof, and an upright Lincoln Mark series-like grille. An estimated 600 Seville Opera Coupes were produced.

The Seville was manufactured in Iran under the brand name of &quot;Cadillac Iran&quot; from 1978 to 1987 by Pars Khodro, which was known as &quot;Iran General Motors&quot; before the Islamic Revolution. A total of 2,653 Cadillacs were made in Iran during this period. This made Iran the only country assembling Cadillacs outside the US until 1997 when the Opel Omega-based Catera was built in Germany for US sale. The Cadillac BLS, built in Sweden exclusively for European market, was introduced in 2006. Although the Allanté had an Italian-sourced body and interior, its final assembly was done in the US.

=== Elegante ===

From 1978, through the third generation in 1988, the Seville was available with the &quot;Elegante&quot; package. It added a unique black/silver two-tone exterior paint combination and perforated leather seats in light gray only. Real wire wheels were standard as were a host of other features which were optional or unavailable on the base Seville.

In 1979, a second color combination was added, a two-tone copper shade with a matching leather interior. For the second generation Elegante in 1985, a monotone paint combination became available; however, dual-shade combinations, later available in various colors, remained more popular. The price for this package increased over time from $2,600 in 1978 ($ in dollars ) to $4,005 ($ in dollars ) in 1987 in addition to the base price.

== Second generation (1980–1985) ==

While the first-generation Seville had proved quite successful, it failed in its primary mission of winning over younger import buyers. Marketing research indicated that the car was most popular with older women who wanted a Cadillac in a smaller, more maneuverable size. For the 1980 model year, the Seville&#x27;s K-body platform became front-wheel drive, based on the E-body Eldorado, Buick Riviera, and Oldsmobile Toronado. Length and wheelbase were similar, with the car losing 0.3&quot; in wheelbase and gaining 0.8&quot; overall. The new model featured independent rear suspension. The standard engine was the new digitally fuel-injected Cadillac L62 V8, with the Oldsmobile diesel carried over from the previous generation available as a no-cost option except in California, where the fuel-injected Oldsmobile 350 was retained for emissions purposes.

The razor-edged bustle-back rear styling drew inspiration from English coachbuilder Hooper &amp; Co.&#x27;s &quot;Empress Line&quot; designs from the early 1950s, which were considered a dramatic, modern take on the mid-&#x27;30s style of trunk/body integration. In addition, long hood/short deck proportions were inspired by luxury cars of the 1960s. The Seville&#x27;s &quot;statement&quot; bustle-back styling was the ultimate realization of many previous conceptual design efforts by GM designer Wayne Kady. The Seville was also one of the last vehicles designed under the leadership of then General Motors Vice President of Design Bill Mitchell, who was a major proponent of the bustle-back design. Bill&#x27;s immediate predecessor, former Vice President of Design Harley Earl, had originally appointed Mitchell as Cadillac&#x27;s first Chief Designer in 1936. It was swiftly imitated by the 1982–87 Lincoln Continental sedan and the 1981–83 Imperial coupe. Sales were strong at first, but disastrous flirtation with diesel engines and the ill-fated V-8-6-4 variable displacement gasoline engine, coupled with poor quality control eroded Seville&#x27;s standing in the marketplace.

The Seville introduced features that would become traditional in later years. In 1981, memory seats appeared—a feature not seen on a Cadillac since the Eldorado Broughams of the late 1950s. This option allowed two stored positions to be recalled at the touch of a button. Also new for 1981 was a digital instrument cluster, shared with the Eldorado. Engine options changed for 1981: the V8 was now equipped with the V8-6-4 variable displacement technology. A carbureted Buick V6 was added as a credit option. Puncture-sealing tires were also new.

In 1982, Seville offered heated outside rear-view mirrors, available with optional rear defogger. Inside, a &quot;Symphony Sound&quot; stereo cassette tape system was available. The previously standard diesel engine became an option with the introduction of a new HT-4100. This engine had a number of reliability issues, such as weak, porous aluminum block castings and failure-prone intake manifold gaskets.

For 1983, the Buick V6 was dropped and a new &quot;Delco/Bose&quot; stereo cassette system was offered at $895. Initially looking like a standard Delco radio, from 1984 onward it featured a brushed gold-look front panel and bulbous lower interior door speaker assemblies. This was also the last year for an available 8-track stereo system. From 1983 through 1985, it was available with a fake cabriolet roof option which gave the appearance of a four-door convertible.

In 1980, the 350 ci L49 was only available for California.

== Third generation (1986–1991) ==


The 1986 featured a transverse-mounted V8 driving the front wheels, an advanced 4-speed automatic transmission, and EPA fuel mileage of on the highway. The Seville&#x27;s computerized engine management system featured a BCM/ECM (Body Control Module/Engine Control Module) and an electronic dashboard using high-intensity vacuum fluorescent displays — made possibly after GM&#x27;s acquisition of Hughes Electronics.

With sales substantially below expectations, Cadillac facelifted the exterior for model year 1988. This was the final generation to have an annual grille facelift. Cadillac introduced the Seville Touring Sedan (STS) trim level this model year, equipped with the FE2 touring suspension, 15-inch alloy wheels, upgraded springs, a rear sway bar, a 15.6:1 steering ratio for enhanced handling, grille mounted emblem, cloisonne trunk lock cover, and a four-passenger interior. Seville Touring Sedan production totaled 1,499 units in 1988. The first 1988 STSs were custom built by Cars and Concepts and announced at that year&#x27;s Detroit Grand Prix. These initial run models were available to VIPs within General Motors, the Cadillac Division, some major shareholders and a short list of dignitaries. A special label was affixed to the lower corner of the driver-side front door identifying it as one of the original STSs. The Elegante trim package, first introduced on Seville in 1978, was discontinued after the 1988 model year.

For 1989, the first production STSs were sold as a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; with option code of YP6. Features from the 1988 model were carried over with the addition of a retuned suspension package for more precise steering and firmer feel of the road. Additional features included hand-stitched beechwood ultrasoft leather seats, anti-lock braking, touring suspension, a 3.3:1 drive ratio, 15-inch cast aluminum alloy wheels, and Goodyear Eagle GT4 blackwall tires.

Additional STS features included: grille with flush-mounted wreath-and-crest, modified driver&#x27;s front fender with the cornering light moved to the front fascia and headlight monitors removed, matching body-color front lower airdam and bodyside moldings, matte black export license pocket with bright bead, matte black front bumper impact pads and rear bumper guard vertical inserts, matching body color outside rearview mirrors with a black patch, modified (from Eldorado) rear reflexes (moved to the bumper), modified export taillamps with three-color European-style lenses, an STS nameplate on the deck lid, and an STS-exclusive cloisonne deck lid lock cover.

The STS interior had a 12-way power front seat, manual articulating front seat headrests, center front armrest with cassette and coin/cup storage console trimmed in ultrasoft leather, netted map pockets, rear bucket seats with integral headrests, center rear console and rear storage compartment, leather-wrapped front and rear door trim panels, door pull straps and overhead pull straps, high-gloss elm burl real wood appliques on door trim panels and switch plates, horn pad and bar, instrument panel and front and rear consoles, floor carpet (marketed as &quot;Beechwood Thaxton&quot; carpet) and a decklid liner in tara material with STS logo. Other standard STS features included automatic door locks, illuminated driver and passenger side visor vanity mirrors, illuminated entry system, rear window defogger, a theft-deterrent system, and trunk mat.

Four exterior colors were available for the STS in 1989: White Diamond, Sable Black, Black Sapphire, or Carmine Red. 1,893 Seville Touring Sedans (STS) were produced for the 1989 model year. The first models were leftovers from the Cars and Concepts run of the 1988 production year with the special sticker located on the lower part on the inside of the driver&#x27;s door. These were produced prior to December 1988 for the 1989 production year and are rare. The last 6 digits of these VIN numbers would be below 808000. As with the 1988 model, a special 3.25&quot; x 2&quot; black/silver chrome label was affixed to the lower inside area of the driver-side front door by Cars and Concepts identifying it as one of the original STS models.

In 1990, the Seville received a new fuel injection system, increasing horsepower to 180. Front park lamps were no longer fender-mounted with any Cadillac model, and the STS was further modified, receiving revised side and rear body color fascias as well as dual exhaust outlets with bright stainless outlets, a larger STS trunk script, standard Teves anti-lock braking system with rear discs, and 16-inch machine finished alloy wheels on Goodyear Eagle GT+4 tires. A driver&#x27;s side airbag was also added to Seville and STS. While the engine was the same as used in regular Seville models, the transmission had a special final drive ratio of 3.33:1 for better acceleration. The 1990 STS also received its own body designation of 6KY69 and prices started at $36,320. 1990 STS production totaled 2,811 vehicles.

There were no body changes in 1991, and the V8&#x27;s displacement increased to 4.9-liter and featured a 4T60E electronically controlled transmission. The new V8 no longer used the A.I.R. system and additional refinements to the internals increased horsepower to 200. The only change to the STS was the removal of the rear bucket seats for a full-width bench and new front seats with larger side bolsters taken from the prior year&#x27;s Eldorado Touring Coupe. 2,206 STS were produced.

== Fourth generation (1992–1997) ==

The Seville was redesigned for 1992. Wheelbase increased 3 inches to and overall length over 13 inches to . The upright formal roofline was replaced by a steeply-raked rear window.
The range was divided into two sub-models:

* The Seville Luxury Sedan (SLS) was introduced with the 4.9 L &quot;HT-4900&quot; V8 and received a &quot;LD8 Northstar&quot; V8 for 1994
* The Seville Touring Sedan (STS) also began with the 4.9 L &quot;HT-4900&quot; in 1992 and was upgraded to the &quot;L37 Northstar&quot; in 1993

The Seville Touring Sedan was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1992. It also made &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list that year. The Seville STS adopted styling cues from the 1988 Cadillac Voyage concept car.

0–60 mph times were 7.4 seconds for the SLS and 6.9 seconds for the STS. Rain sensing wipers, called RainSense, were standard on the STS.

From 1994, both models were equipped with the GM 4T80 transmission but different final drive. There were model specific bumpers, side plastic molding and rear taillights. The STS models featured body-colored front grille, while the SLS models had a chrome-plated grille and a Cadillac hood badge. On the inside, the STS models used more Zebrawood trim compared to the SLS. The seats in the STS models were covered with perforated leather in contrast with the non-perforated leather on the SLS. The SLS models could have been specified with the optional column shifter. The STS models featured active suspension (CVRSS) while the SLS models were equipped with passive suspension. Both models were equipped with speed-sensitive steering effort and rear pneumatic self-levelling suspension, power antenna, soft-close trunk lid and 2 driver memories for seats, rear view mirrors, climate control, and sound system settings.

The 1993 addition of the Northstar System, including the Northstar quad-cam 32-valve aluminum V8 and a new unequal-length control arm rear suspension to the STS, helped increase sales. The rear suspension previously featured a single transverse leaf spring like the Chevrolet Corvette.

As of 1994 model year, the Seville STS (and companion Eldorado ETC) became the most powerful front-wheel-drive cars on the market at 300 hp (224 kW).

For the 1996 production year, on both models, the interior was revised including seats, central console, shifter knob and door trim. Due to the 1996 OBD-II compliance mandate most electronic modules were revised. Two sound system options were introduced, the base Delco Electronics and the optional BOSE, both sound systems featured AM/FM radio and tape player. Both could be connected to the optional trunk-mounted 12-disc CD player and the optional cellular phone. The BOSE sound system included 4 amplifiers and added Digital signal processor (DSP) and Radio Data System (RDS). In some export markets the sound system was slightly different. Steering controls were standard for the climate control and the sound system. The exterior changes are minimal, for the STS models new 7-spoke 16-inch aluminum rims were introduced in silver finish and as an option in chrome finish. Depending on the tire options, the top speed was limited to 130 mph (&quot;H&quot; rated tires) or 156 mph (&quot;Z&quot; rated tires).

In 1997, some of the electronic modules were further updated for OBD-II compliance reasons, a revised climate control module is introduced and there are updates to the stability system with the addition of a yaw sensor. Some of the advanced DIC self diagnostic features were removed requiring a TechII scanner tool instead. The TheftLock feature is added to the Head Unit (HU). The heated windshield option is no longer available for 1997.

Base prices for both models peaked in 1996 at US$42,995 () for the SLS and US$47,495 () for the STS but the increasingly competitive luxury car market resulted in price reductions for 1997. They were reduced to $39,995 () for the SLS and $44,995 () for the STS.

== Fifth generation (1998–2004) ==

A redesigned Seville was introduced in late 1997 for 1998 model year, built on GM&#x27;s G platform (which GM chose to continue to refer to as the K). All transverse engine front-wheel drive Sevilles were built in Hamtramck, Michigan.

The wheelbase was extended to but the overall length was down slightly to . The car looked similar to the fourth-generation model, and featured numerous suspension and drivability revisions. The Seville &quot;STS&quot; (and companion Eldorado &quot;ETC&quot;) continued as the most powerful front-wheel-drive cars on the market at 300 hp (224 kW). The top STS model ran 0–60 mph in 6.4 seconds and had a 14.8 second quarter-mile time.

The fifth-generation Seville was the first Cadillac engineered in both left- and right-hand-drive form; and the first modern Cadillac to be officially marketed in a right-hand-drive market (the United Kingdom). Models sold in Japan were left-hand drive. In the past, right-hand-drive Cadillacs were manufactured from CKD kits or special conversion kits shipped for local conversion. An export version was produced with narrower bumpers to get under a 5-meter taxation length. The 1998 Seville was the first Cadillac launched with a European type approval number in Europe; the United Kingdom first, and then Germany, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy, Finland and other markets.

On the fifth-generation Seville, the steering column was a power tilt and telescoping unit with its operation was tied into the memory functions. The soft-close trunk lid and power antenna was no longer available. The car&#x27;s security system was now equipped with the Passlock III, an update for the resistor-based Passlock II, which was updated from the previous generation. Also, updated from the previous generation was the car&#x27;s the sound system. It added a head unit with radio, tape and CD player. The cellular phone option was still available, however the optional trunk-mounted CD player was replaced with a 6-disc unit. Between 1998 and 1999 a first-generation (non-touch screen) GPS navigation option was available. It was updated in 2000 with a larger touchscreen DVD-based GPS navigation unit.

In 1999, a one-year only (for the Seville) massage seats option was available. In 2000, the tire-pressure monitoring system (TPMS) became available as an option. In January 2002, the STS received a new &quot;MagneRide&quot; adaptive suspension system, unavailable on the SLS, becoming the first production vehicle equipped standard with such suspension technology.

Production of the Seville STS ended on May 16, 2003. Seville SLS production ended seven months later on December 4, 2003. In 2004, only the Seville SLS model was available for purchase. The Seville model name was discontinued for 2005 and replaced with the Cadillac STS.

<text>The Løgting (pronounced ; ) is the unicameral parliament of the Faroe Islands, an autonomous territory within the Danish Realm. 

The name literally means &quot;Law Thing&quot;—that is, a law assembly—and derives from Old Norse &quot;lǫgþing&quot;, which was a name given to ancient assemblies. A &quot;ting&quot; or &quot;þing&quot; has existed on the Faroe Islands for over a millennium and the Løgting was the highest authority on the islands in the Viking era. From 1274 to 1816 it functioned primarily as a judicial body, whereas the modern Løgting established in 1852 is a parliamentary assembly, which gained legislative power when home rule was introduced in 1948. Together with the Manx Tynwald and the Icelandic Alþing, the Løgting is one of the oldest surviving parliaments in the world, all three holding lineages to the old Norse assemblies of mainland Europe.

Today, the Faroe Islands comprise one constituency, and the number of MPs is fixed at 33. The first election with this new system was held on 19 January 2008, after the Election law was changed in late 2007, prior to which the membership of the Løgting varied from 27 to 32. The 7 constituencies had 27 seats and up to 5 supplementary seats. That Election Act came into force in 1978, and the eight general elections between 1978 and 2004 all resulted in 32 members.

The Løgting is elected for a period of four years. Election of the Løgting can take place before the end of an election period if the Løgting agrees on dissolving itself. The Løgmaður (Prime Minister) issues a proclamation of the forthcoming election and appoints the day of election, which must take place, at the earliest, six weeks
after the proclamation.

==History==

===The Viking Age===
The Faroese ting or assembly was originally a so-called &quot;alþing&quot;, with both legislative and judicial authority. During this time, there was no executive authority in the country. The Faroese society was a family society (&quot;eitt ættarsamfelag&quot;), where the families saw to it that the judgments and resolutions of the Løgting were put into practice.

There is some evidence that the Faroes were already colonised as early as 650. The first inhabitants, who were of Celtic descent, were driven out by Norse landnamsmen in about 825. Faroese society in the Viking Age and the Middle Ages resembled the other Nordic populations in many ways. This was particularly true when it came to legislation. The most important body of law was the &quot;Gulatingslógin&quot;, an ancient Norwegian agricultural law which originated in the Gulating legislative area in Vestlandet in Norway. Originally, this law was preserved through oral tradition, but it was written down about the year 1100.

The earliest historical sources locate the Løgting on the Tinganes a peninsula, today known as the oldest neighbourhood in Tórshavn. In the Viking age, it was a tradition to hold the &quot;ting&quot; at a neutral and uninhabited place, in order to prevent anyone from having an advantage. There were no settlements on Tinganes at the time, and its central location in relation to the rest of the islands may have made it the most ideal location.

Unlike the Icelandic Althing, the Løgting&#x27;s foundation is not historically documented; however, it is implied to be a well-established institution when it is mentioned for the first time in the Færeyinga saga as the &quot;Straumseyarþing&quot; (&quot;Streymoy &quot;thing&quot;&quot;), in which a mid-10th century legal dispute at the thing between chieftains Havgrímur and Einar Suðuroyingur, resulting in the exile of Eldjarn Kambhøttur, is recounted in detail.

This early Faroese ting was also described as the assembly of the &quot;Faroes&#x27; best men&quot; who were a free assembly of the wealthier farmers, and the Faroes constituted a kind of republic with a population of about 4,000 people and 60,000 sheep. The president of the ting was the &quot;Løgsøgumaður&quot;, who had no voting rights.

The Viking Age in the Faroes ended in 1035 when Tróndur í Gøtu died and Leivur Øssursson (the son-in-law of Sigmundur Brestisson) became liege lord under king Magnus I of Norway. Yet, the Faroes remained a kind of self-governing society for the next 150 years.

===Norwegian rule===

The status of the Faroes changed under king Magnus VI of Norway, who introduced the Norwegian Landslog (&quot;Land&#x27;s Law&quot;) in 1274. By this time, The Faroese &quot;ting&quot; had become an assembly of representatives of the 6 local vártings, with only judicial authority. This was called lǫgþing in Old Norse, according to the High Courts of Norway. Its president, the Løgmaður, was the presiding judge, and was, from then on, appointed by the king. Its members were called &quot;Løgrættumenn&quot; (approximately translating to &quot;jurymen&quot;), appointed by the King&#x27;s Provost on the Faroes.

On 24 June 1298 the Faroes gained its first form of constitution, the Seyðabrævið (&quot;Sheep Letter&quot;, concerning sheep breeding): the earliest such document the islands know today.

Around 1380, the Faroes, together with Norway, came under the Danish throne, but the islands preserved their special status as former Norwegian territory. Regardless of these developments, the Løgting preserved a certain influence on the legislature and the administration of the islands until the introduction of the absolute monarchy in 1660 under Frederick III. From that date the influence and authority of the Løgting had become again reduced, and the institution was finally abolished in 1816. At the same time, the judicial authority of the Løgting was transferred to other courts, such as the newly inaugurated Court of the Faroes.

===Danish rule===
When Denmark received a free and, for that period, democratic constitution in 1849, this signalled the end of the special status the Faroes had held within the kingdom of Denmark. This was enacted without consulting the Faroese population. At that time many of them wished to see the Løgting reinstated, one reason being that they were not satisfied with the situation that the highest Danish government official, called the Amtmaður, was the sole advisory authority on the Faroes on matters of Faroese legislation. Among those who campaigned for political rights of the Faroes was Niels Winther (1822–1892). When the Act of 23 March 1852 was passed it meant that the Faroese Løgting was to be reconstituted, although not as a legislative assembly, but as an advisory body, an &quot;amtsráð&quot;. The reconstituted Løgting held its first assembly on Ólavsøka in 1852, and thus revived the traditions of the former institution which had been abolished in 1816.

Even though at that time the Løgting had only limited political authority and influence, the institution gradually gained in significance as the representative of the Faroes to the Danish government and parliament (the &quot;rigsdag&quot;) and as a political forum where politically conscious Faroese islanders could gain experience of politics. The Løgting became the political platform for the Faroese nationalist movement. One of the chief objectives behind the demand for political home rule which its supporters put forward was that the Løgting should have legislative powers.

In the assembly established in 1852, the Amtmaður, the highest Danish government official, was &quot;ex officio&quot; the president of the Løgting. However, this rule was amended in 1923, so that the president was, from then on, elected by the members of the Løgting. Since 1927, the Løgting protocols are written in Faroese, and in 1935 the Løgting was authorised to levy taxes.

===World War II===
During World War II, when the Faroes were occupied by the United Kingdom on 12 April 1940 and relations with Denmark were interrupted, the Løgting actually functioned as a legislative assembly, and the Faroes had their own government consisting of the Amtmaður Carl Aage Hilbert and ministers appointed by the Løgting.

In this period, the Faroese proved able to govern themselves. At the end of the war, the independence movement (mainly under influence of the new Fólkaflokkurin) was so powerful that none of the political parties were willing to return to the pre-war situation where the status of the Faroes had practically been that of a Danish county (&quot;Færøernes amt&quot;).

=== Self-government ===
Long and laborious negotiations followed between the Danish government and the representatives of the Løgting. Finally a public vote was held on 14 September 1946 where the electorate was to choose between a Danish proposition of Home rule and full secession from Denmark. This election is not considered a referendum, as the parliament was not bound to follow the decision of the vote. The result was a marginal majority of 161 votes for secession from Denmark (48.7% in favour, 47.2% against, 4.1% blank or spoilt).

The republican coalition majority in parliament interpreted the results as a resolve by the Faroese people for full Faroese independence from Denmark and started the process of secession as well as establishing proper governing bodies for an independent Faroese nation. The Government of Denmark contested the legality of this process, and on 25 September the King of Denmark signed a document dissolving the Faroese parliament and a new election was held a few months later. This election resulted in a significant majority of 2,000 votes for the parties favoring a union with Denmark, and a new unionist coalition was formed. Based on their growth in votes they chose not to pass the secession, but as a compromise, the Home Rule Act was constituted and came into force on 1 April 1948.

As it was then, this election is still shrouded in controversy today, and there exist two popular stances in this discussion. On one hand, some people argue that there was a resolve in favor of independence, as there actually was a factual majority for secession, even if it was a small one. On the other hand, other people argue that the majority was far too small, as there were in fact only 161 more votes for independence, and this side specifically argues that only a qualified majority can be large enough grounds to pass a vote of such social and political consequence.

Under the Home Rule Act, the Faroese Løgting is the legislative authority in special Faroese matters, defined as &quot;særanliggender&quot;, while other areas are administered by the Danish national authorities as common matters, &quot;fællesanliggender&quot;. With the passing of a new statute in 1995, parliamentarism was legally adopted and at the same time the structure and functions of the Løgting were modernised. A proper Faroese Constitution is planned and underway.

==Authority==
After Home Rule had come into force the parliamentary work of the Løgting changed fundamentally. Before Home Rule the Faroese Parliament had only been a consultative body, whereas now the Faroese Parliament has legislative power within all the branches taken over from the Danish Parliament (&quot;Det danske Folketing&quot;). According to the Home Rule Act the various branches of legislative power are divided into an &quot;A-sector&quot; and a &quot;B-sector&quot;. 
*The several branches within the A-sector can be taken over by the Løgting, if either the Løgting or the Danish Government so wish. 
*The branches within the B-sector can only be transferred to the Løgting if the Faroese Government (&quot;Føroya Landsstýri&quot;) and the Danish Government agree on the terms.

Matters regarding defence and foreign policy are outside the scope of Home Rule. The Danish Folketing has legislative power in all areas except those which have been taken over by the Løgting. The Faroese have two seats in the Danish Folketing. Within the framework of Home Rule the Løgting provides for constitutional affairs and for the order of business.

According to the Faroese Home Rule Act the organization of internal affairs is solely within the province of the Faroese Parliament. An act concerning this matter was passed on 26 July 1994. According to section No. 1. of this act the division of legal power concerning matters taken over by the Home Rule is now shared jointly between the Faroese Parliament and the Prime Minister, executive power rests with the Government whereas judicial power in such matters rests with the Danish courts. The Parliament is elected for a period of four years, and the maximum membership is 32 members who are elected in public, secret, and direct elections. The government consists of the Prime Minister (&quot;løgmaður&quot;) and not fewer than two ministers (&quot;landsstýrismenn&quot;).

The Prime Minister is appointed indirectly by the Parliament. The Chairman of the Parliament after having had talks with the party leaders submits a proposal for a new Prime Minister, a vote is taken, and if a majority of the members reject the candidate then the proposal is rejected, otherwise the candidate is accepted. The Prime Minister appoints the ministers. Neither the Prime Minister nor a minister may hold their seats if a vote no confidence is put forward and 17 MPs are opposed. The Prime Minister has at any time the power to call an election. The Prime Minister and the ministers are not permitted to hold seats in the Parliament.

==Committees==
The Løgting has 7 standing committees which in accordance with the order of business of the Faroese Parliament are elected for the duration of the election period unless the members of the Parliament agree on electing the committees anew.

Standing Committees:
*The Finance Committee. As provided by section 44, subsection 2 of the Home Rule Act, the committee grants supplementary approval and in addition it makes recommendations to the Faroese Parliament on matters of finances, economy, taxes, and duties.
*Committee on Foreign Affairs. As provided by section 54 of the Home Rule Act the committee makes recommendations to the Faroese Government on foreign affairs, trade matters, and defence matters, and in addition recommendations on relations with Denmark.
*Committee on Fisheries and Industry. Its tasks are to make recommendations to the Parliament on fisheries matters, shipping matters, matters concerning the fishing industry, industrial matters, matters concerning fish farming, agricultural matters, matters concerning the environment, matters concerning communication and transport, matters concerning energy and oil industry, trade matters and furthermore matters concerning commercial companies and registration matters etc.
*The Welfare Committee. Its tasks are to make recommendations to the Parliament on social matters, matters concerning the labour market, and matters concerning housing.
*Committee on Judicial Affairs. Its tasks are to make recommendations to the Parliament on judicial and municipal matters. 
*Committee on Governmental Affairs. As provided by section 38 of the Home Rule Act the committee&#x27;s task is to have judicial supervision with the Prime Minister and the ministers and to see to it that they observe the rules of law. The committee has authority to summon the Prime Minister or ministers to explain in detail items concerning any political question.

==Election results since 1906==
The parliament is typically split into four main parties, each of which typically get around 20% in elections: the conservative Union Party, the Social Democratic Party, the liberal-independentist People&#x27;s Party, and the democratic socialist Republic, who each take a unique position on left/right and independence/unionism axis. In addition, there are three smaller parties with representation: the classical liberal Progress, the liberal New Self-Government, and the Christian conservative Centre party.

At the elections each party has a certain letter, which is also used on posters for the campaigns.

===Latest results===

The last general elections were held in the Faroe Islands on 8 December 2022.
==The Session of the Løgting==

The first meeting of the Løgting is on Saint Olaf&#x27;s Day (&quot;ólavsøka&quot;). On 29 July the members of the Løgting, the ministers (&quot;landsstýrismenn&quot;), the High Commissioner of Denmark (&quot;ríkisumboðsmaður&quot;), and high officials walk in procession (&quot;skrúðgonga&quot;) from the Parliament building to the cathedral (&quot;Havnar kirkja&quot;). After the service the procession returns to Parliament House, and the Løgting is opened.

At the first meeting the Prime Minister (Løgmaður) delivers his Saint Olaf&#x27;s Day address, in which he gives a general description of the state of the nation. The Løgting has one major parliamentary debate concerning the state of the nation. The debate is about Løgmaður&#x27;s Saint Olaf&#x27;s Address, and the budget.

As a rule the Løgting debates between 100 and 150 various items in one session.

This Ólavsøka tradition is very old and dates back to the time of the Norwegian rule. In these former times was the Løgting only held one time the year starting with Ólavsøka and sitting 8 days from 6 in the morning to 3 in the afternoon, with church service each day, and all priests of the Faroes attendant. In the 17th century this was a bit modified - now only meeting with all priests at Ólavsøka day.

==Historical documentation over the centuries==
The protocols of the Løgting assemblies and its other archives from 1852 up to the present are kept at the Faroese National Archive in Tórshavn. The Løgting&#x27;s protocols from 1615 to 1816 are also preserved at the National Archive. The total archives of the Løgting contain the most important sources of Faroese history. Thus the Faroese Løgting is a parliament with an exceptionally well-documented history, where the archives in fact cover the period right from 1298 to the present. There are only a very few parliaments in Europe with archives preserved to the same extent where the records are continuous both through time and in their contents.

Together with the other texts in the &quot;Kongsbókin&quot;, the Statute concerning sheep breeding on the Faroes (&quot;Seyðabrævið&quot;) contains information on conditions in society, the economy, the language, culture and cultural history. The Løgting&#x27;s archives from 1615 to 1816 contain similar rich sources of material on all aspects of the history of the Faroes in that period. The Løgting&#x27;s archives for the period from 1852 to the present also provide the most important source of information on the more recent and latest political history of the Faroes. The Faroese cultural heritage is founded on this abundance of source material, which is thus at the very heart of the Faroese identity and sense of history right from the landnam period to the present time.

<text>The Peace of Breda, or Treaty of Breda was signed in the Dutch city of Breda, on 31 July 1667. It consisted of three separate treaties between England and each of its opponents in the Second Anglo-Dutch War: the Dutch Republic, France, and Denmark–Norway. It also included a separate Anglo-Dutch commercial agreement. 

Negotiations had been in progress since late 1666 but were slow, as both sides tried to improve their positions. This changed after the French invasion of the Spanish Netherlands in late May, which the Dutch viewed as a more serious threat. War-weariness in England was increased by the June Raid on the Medway. Both factors led to a rapid agreement of terms. Among the terms was confirmation of colonial territories taken in the War, including Suriname to the Dutch and New Netherland (New York) to the English.

Prior to 1667, the Anglo-Dutch relationship had been dominated by commercial conflict, which the treaty did not end entirely. However, tensions decreased markedly and cleared the way for the 1668 Triple Alliance between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden. With the brief anomaly of the 1672 to 1674 Third Anglo-Dutch War, the treaty marked the beginning of an alliance between the English and the Dutch that would last for a century.

==Background==
The Second Anglo-Dutch War was caused by commercial tensions, heightened by Charles II, who saw trade as a way to reduce his financial dependence on Parliament. In 1660, he and his brother James founded the Royal African Company (RAC), challenging the Dutch in West Africa. Investors included senior politicians such as George Carteret, Shaftesbury and Arlington, creating a strong link between the RAC and government policy. 

Huge profits from Asian spices led to conflict even in times of peace, as the Dutch East India Company, or VOC, first created, then enforced, their monopoly over production and trade. By 1663, indigenous and European competitors like the Portuguese had been eliminated, leaving only nutmeg plantations on Run. These had been established by the British East India Company in 1616, before being evicted by the VOC in 1620; when the English re-occupied Run in late 1664, the Dutch expelled them again, this time destroying the plantations.

There was a similar struggle over the Atlantic trade between the Dutch West-Indische Compagnie, or WIC, and competitors from Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Portugal and England. Sugar plantations in the Americas were cultivated by slaves from Africa, fed by colonies in North America, leading to conflict in all three regions. In August 1664, the English occupied New Netherland, later renamed New York; when another attack captured WIC slave trade posts in modern Ghana, the Dutch sent a fleet to recapture them. The result was to bankrupt the RAC, whose investors saw war as the best way to recoup their losses.

Despite the Franco-Dutch treaty of April 1662, Louis XIV initially remained neutral, as French and Dutch economic interests increasingly diverged over the Spanish Netherlands. The 1648 Peace of Münster permanently closed the Scheldt estuary and the port of Antwerp, which did not recover economically until the 19th century. The combination gave Amsterdam effective control of trade in North-West Europe. Louis considered the Spanish Netherlands his by right of marriage to Maria Theresa of Spain but hoped to acquire them peacefully. Negotiations with the Dutch continually broke down over his desire to re-open Antwerp as an export route for French goods. By 1663, he concluded they would never make concessions voluntarily and began planning a military intervention. 

In early 1665, England signed an alliance with Sweden against the Dutch, who suffered a serious defeat at Lowestoft in June, followed by an invasion from Münster. Louis responded by activating the 1662 treaty, calculating this would make it harder for the Dutch to oppose his occupation of the Spanish Netherlands. He also paid Sweden to remain neutral, while influencing Denmark–Norway to join the war. Danish assistance saved the Dutch merchant fleet at the Battle of Vågen in August, although this turned out to have been the result of miscommunication. Frederick III of Denmark had secretly agreed to help the English capture the fleet in return for a share of the profits, but his instructions arrived too late.

By late 1666, Charles was short of money, largely due to his refusal to recall Parliament, while English trade had been badly affected by the war and domestic disasters. In contrast, the Dutch economy had largely recovered from its post-1665 contraction, while public debt was lower in 1667 than 1652; however, naval warfare was enormously expensive and financing it a challenge even for the Amsterdam markets. Both sides wanted peace, since the Dutch had little to gain from continuing the war and faced external challenges from competitors. Denmark resented concessions imposed at Christianopel in 1647, while the WIC&#x27;s confiscation of Danish ships was an ongoing source of dispute; in early 1667, they joined Sweden and France in imposing tariffs on Dutch goods, impacting the Baltic grain trade.

In October 1666, Charles opened discussions with the States-General of the Netherlands, under the pretext of arrangements to return the body of Vice-Admiral William Berkeley, killed in the Four Days&#x27; Battle. He invited the Dutch to negotiations in London and withdrew previous demands for the appointment of his nephew William of Orange as stadtholder, payment of damages, the return of Run and a trade deal on India. The States-General refused to attend peace talks without France; on territorial claims, they offered to continue the present situation, or revert to the position before the war, an option clearly unacceptable to the English. 

It is questionable how sincere this offer from Charles actually was, since his envoy in Paris, the Earl of St Albans, was simultaneously holding secret talks on an Anglo-French alliance. Louis agreed to ensure the Dutch complied with English demands, in exchange for a free hand in the Spanish Netherlands; by April 1667, diplomats in The Hague were predicting a deal was imminent. When talks eventually began, the English delegation felt their position was extremely strong.

==Negotiations==
Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt and the States of Holland rejected English proposals to negotiate in The Hague, a town dominated by the Orangist opposition. They were supported by Louis, who viewed the Orangists as English agents. Angered by the delay, the States of Zeeland, Gelderland, Groningen, Overijssel and Friesland threatened to stop paying for a war &#x27;continued only by Holland&#x27;s obstinacy.&#x27; 

The parties eventually settled on Breda, but French military preparations led the Orangists to accuse De Witt of deliberately stalling to allow Louis a free hand in the Spanish Netherlands. This put De Witt under pressure to reach agreement, which increased after France and Portugal agreed an anti-Spanish alliance in March.

The role of mediator in peace talks provided prestige and the opportunity to build relationships; since Louis and Leopold both wanted the position, they compromised by using Swedish diplomats. Key players in the vital Baltic trade in grain, iron and shipping supplies, the Swedes hoped to remove commercial concessions imposed by the Republic in the 1656 Treaty of Elbing and end its alliance with Denmark. Göran Fleming was based at Breda, with Peter Coyet in The Hague; after Coyet died on 8 June, he was replaced by Count Dohna, who was instructed to negotiate a Swedish-English-French alliance if talks at Breda failed. 

The States General appointed eight delegates but only those from Holland, Zeeland and Friesland were actually present. Two of the three were Orangists, Zeelandic Pensionary Pieter de Huybert and Friesland&#x27;s van Jongestall; the delegate from Holland, Van Beverningh, was a member of De Witt&#x27;s States Party. The English lead negotiators were Denzil Holles, Ambassador to France, and Henry Coventry, Ambassador to Sweden. 

On 24 May, Louis launched the War of Devolution, French troops quickly occupying much of the Spanish Netherlands and Franche-Comté. To focus on this, Spain needed to end the long-running Portuguese Restoration War. On 27 May, the Anglo-Spanish Treaty of Madrid formally concluded the 1654 to 1660 war and in return for commercial concessions, England agreed to mediate with Portugal.

The threat to the Dutch economy presented by French expansion made ending the Anglo-Dutch War a matter of urgency. Backed by assurances from Louis that he would force the Dutch to agree concessions, the English increased their demands and Van Beverningh told De Witt a major military victory was needed to improve their bargaining position. An opportunity was provided by Charles, who decommissioned most of the Royal Navy in late 1666 as a cost-saving measure. The Dutch took full advantage in the June 1667 Medway Raid; although the action itself had limited strategic impact, it was a humiliation Charles never forgot.

Holles and Coventry initially assumed this would extend negotiations, but the need to create an alliance against France meant Spain threatened to withhold implementation of the Madrid treaty, supported by Leopold. Combined with economic losses caused by the war and the Great Fire of London, Clarendon instructed Holles to agree terms &quot;to calm people&#x27;s minds&quot; and &quot;free the king from a burden...he is finding hard to bear&quot;.

==Terms==
Article 1 of the treaty stipulated a limited military alliance, obliging fleets or single ships sailing on the same course to defend each other against a third party. Article 3 established the principle of &quot;uti possidetis&quot;, or &quot;what you have, you hold&quot;, with an effective date of 20 May. The Dutch kept Surinam, now part of modern Suriname, Fort Cormantin and Run while the English kept New Netherland, which was subsequently divided into the colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Delaware. 

Articles 4 to 8 applied the same principle to losses of goods or ships, including those that occurred before the war. No indemnities could be levied or punishments imposed, but all existing Letters of Marque were declared void. To allow time to communicate these instructions, Article 7 varied the date on which they would be enforced: 5 September for the English Channel and the North Sea, 5 October for the other European seas, 2 November for the African coast north of the Equator and 24 April 1668 for the rest of the world.

Article 10 required all prisoners to be exchanged without ransom although the Dutch later demanded reimbursement of their living expenses, which the English viewed as the same thing. After their failed 1666 coup, many Orangists sought refuge in England, with English and Scots dissidents going the other way. In Articles 13 and 17, both sides undertook not to protect each other&#x27;s rebels; in a secret annex, the Dutch undertook to extradite regicides who voted for the Execution of Charles I in 1649, although in practice these provisions were ignored.

A separate treaty amended the Navigation Acts; goods transported along the Rhine or Scheldt to Amsterdam could be carried by Dutch ships to England without being subject to tariffs. England also accepted the principle of &quot;free ships make free goods&quot;, which prevented the Royal Navy from intercepting Dutch ships during wars in which the Dutch were neutral. These terms were preliminary, with a definitive text signed on 17 February 1668.

The Danish and French treaties followed the Anglo-Dutch version in waiving claims for restitution of losses. In addition, England returned the French possessions of Cayenne and Acadia, captured in 1667 and 1654 respectively, but the exact boundaries were not specified, and the handover was delayed until 1670. England regained Montserrat and Antigua, and the Anglo-French division of the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts was restored. After the treaties were signed on 31 July, they were sent to each country for ratification, a process which was completed by 24 August and followed by public celebrations in Breda.

==Aftermath==
By exchanging New Netherland and Run, Breda removed two major areas of dispute, reducing Anglo-Dutch tensions overall and clearing the way for the 1668 Triple Alliance between the Republic, Sweden and England. The Alliance is often credited with forcing France to return most of their gains at Aix-la-Chapelle, whereas the terms had already been agreed by Louis and Leopold in January 1668. In the longer term, Breda was the point when the English and Dutch came to view France as a greater threat than each other; whilst Charles&#x27; preference for a French alliance led to the 1670 Secret Treaty of Dover, the long-term trend was against him. Support for re-asserting English naval power provided limited backing in the Third Anglo-Dutch War but ended once that had been achieved.

The treaty disappointed Orangists by failing to restore the House of Orange or allow exiles home, as promised by Charles. When Zeeland and Friesland, in response to the French advance, proposed William be made Captain-General of the Dutch States Army, the States of Holland responded on 5 August with the Perpetual Edict. This abolished the position of Stadholder of Holland, while a second resolution agreed to oppose that any confederate Captain-General or Admiral-General would become stadtholder of another province. Since the army was viewed as an Orangist power base, spending on it was deliberately minimised; this had catastrophic effects in 1672.

Breda was also a success for Sweden, who used their position as mediators to improve the Elbing provisions, break the Dutch-Danish agreement and join the Triple Alliance. The Spanish regained Franche-Comté and most of the Spanish Netherlands; more significantly, the Dutch now viewed them as a better neighbour than an ambitious France. Overall, the Dutch considered Breda and the creation of the Alliance a diplomatic triumph; the period immediately following is often considered the high point of the Dutch Golden Age.

<text>The Inatsisartut (, ; ), also known as the Parliament of Greenland in English, is the unicameral parliament (legislative branch) of Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Danish Realm. Established in 1979, it meets in Inatsisartut, on the islet of Nuuk Center in central Nuuk.

There are 31 members, who are elected for four-year periods by proportional representation.

==History of the parliament==
The Parliament of Greenland succeeded the provincial council () on 1 May 1979. The parliament is led by a presidency comprising four members of the parliament, and the chairman. There are 31 members in the assembly.

==Speaker==
The speaker is the presiding officer of the Inatsisartut. The speaker determines which members may speak, and is responsible for maintaining order. On 3 October 2018, Siumut had Vivian Motzfeldt, the outgoing Foreign Minister, elected. On 16 April 2021, Hans Enoksen was elected again.

The speaker is nominated by the prime minister immediately following a general election and is confirmed by members; the speaker appoints four deputies.

<text>Pearlite is a two-phased, lamellar (or layered) structure composed of alternating layers of ferrite (87.5 wt%) and cementite (12.5 wt%) that occurs in some steels and cast irons. During slow cooling of an iron-carbon alloy, pearlite forms by a eutectoid reaction as austenite cools below (the eutectoid temperature). Pearlite is a microstructure occurring in many common grades of steels.

== Composition ==

The eutectoid composition of austenite is approximately 0.76% carbon; steel with less carbon content (hypoeutectoid steel) will contain a corresponding proportion of relatively pure ferrite crystallites that do not participate in the eutectoid reaction and cannot transform into pearlite. Likewise steels with higher carbon content (hypereutectoid steels) will form cementite before reaching the eutectoid point. The proportion of ferrite and cementite forming above the eutectoid point can be calculated from the iron/iron—carbide equilibrium phase diagram using the lever rule.

Steels with pearlitic (eutectoid composition) or near-pearlitic microstructure (near-eutectoid composition) can be drawn into thin wires. Such wires, often bundled into ropes, are commercially used as piano wires, ropes for suspension bridges, and as steel cord for tire reinforcement. High degrees of wire drawing (logarithmic strain above 3) leads to pearlitic wires with yield strengths of several gigapascals. It makes pearlite one of the strongest structural bulk materials on earth.
Some hypereutectoid pearlitic steel wires, when cold wire drawn to true (logarithmic) strains above 5, can even show a maximal tensile strength above . Although pearlite is used in many engineering applications, the origin of its extreme strength is not well understood. It has been recently shown that cold wire drawing not only strengthens pearlite by refining the lamellae structure, but also simultaneously causes partial chemical decomposition of cementite, associated with an increased carbon content of the ferrite phase, deformation induced lattice defects in ferrite lamellae, and even a structural transition from crystalline to amorphous cementite. The deformation-induced decomposition and microstructural change of cementite is closely related to several other phenomena such as a strong redistribution of carbon and other alloy elements like silicon and manganese in both the cementite and the ferrite phase; a variation of the deformation accommodation at the phase interfaces due to a change in the carbon concentration gradient at the interfaces; and mechanical alloying.

Pearlite was first identified by Henry Clifton Sorby and initially named sorbite, however the similarity of microstructure to nacre and especially the optical effect caused by the scale of the structure made the alternative name more popular.

Pearlite forms as a result of the cooperative growth of ferrite and cementite during the decomposition of austenite. The morphology of pearlite is significantly affected by the cooling rate and coiling temperature. At lower coiling temperatures, pearlite forms with finer lamellar spacing, resulting in enhanced mechanical properties due to the finer distribution of ferrite and cementite layers. Conversely, at higher coiling temperatures, pearlite forms with coarser lamellae, and a smaller amount of pearlite is observed as coarse cementite particles tend to dominate the structure. The carbon diffusion during the formation of pearlite, just ahead of the growth front, is critical in determining the thickness of the lamellae and, consequently, the strength of the steel.

Bainite is a similar structure with lamellae much smaller than the wavelength of visible light and thus lacks this pearlescent appearance. It is prepared by more rapid cooling. Unlike pearlite, whose formation involves the diffusion of all atoms, bainite grows by a displacive transformation mechanism.

The transformation of pearlite to austenite takes place at lower critical temperature of . At this temperature pearlite changes to austenite because of nucleation process.

==Eutectoid steel==
Eutectoid steel can in principle be transformed completely into pearlite; hypoeutectoid steels can also be completely pearlitic if transformed at a temperature below the normal eutectoid. Pearlite can be hard and strong but is not particularly tough. It can be wear-resistant because of a strong lamellar network of ferrite and cementite. Examples of applications include cutting tools, high strength wires, knives, chisels, and nails.

<text>Gilbert James McDougald (May 19, 1928 – November 28, 2010) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) infielder who played for the New York Yankees from 1951 through 1960.

McDougald was the 1951 American League (AL) Rookie of the Year. He was an All-Star for five seasons, and was a member of eight American League pennant-winning teams and five World Series champion teams. He was known for hitting a line drive that severely injured pitcher Herb Score&#x27;s right eye during a game at Municipal Stadium in .

==Early life==
McDougald was born in San Francisco, the younger of two sons born to William James McDougald and his wife, the former Ella McGuire. 
He attended Commerce High School, where he was an All-City basketball player. He did not make the varsity baseball team until his senior year.

After graduation in 1946, he attended City College of San Francisco and the University of San Francisco. During this time, he played with the local Boston Braves feeder team, the Bayside Braves, where he adopted his unorthodox but effective batting stance.

==MLB career==
The Yankees signed him to a contract in the spring of 1948. He played for various minor league teams before being promoted to the big leagues in 1951.

McDougald played his first major league game on April 20, 1951. On May 3 of that year, he tied a major league record, since broken, by batting in six runs in one inning. Later in the year, in the World Series, he became the first rookie to hit a grand slam home run in the Series. He narrowly beat out Minnie Miñoso in the voting for the 1951 American League Rookie of the Year. His entire major league career was spent on the New York Yankees. He was a versatile player, playing all the infield positions except first base: 599 games at second base, 508 games at third, and 284 at shortstop. He was an All-Star in , , , , and , playing in four of the six games that were played (two All-Star games were held in 1959).

McDougald led all American League infielders in double plays at three different positions – at third base (), at second base () and shortstop (). He was the double play leader at shortstop despite sharing time at the position with rookie Tony Kubek.

On May 7, , McDougald, batting against Herb Score of the Cleveland Indians, hit a line drive that hit Score in the right eye. It caused Score to miss the rest of the 1957 and much of the season. While addressing reporters following the contest, McDougald said, &quot;If Herb loses the sight in his eye, I&#x27;m going to quit the game.&quot; Score regained his vision and returned to pitching in the majors late in 1958. Only two years before, McDougald was struck in the left ear during batting practice by a ball hit by teammate Bob Cerv. Though initially believed to be a concussion (he missed only a few games), McDougald soon lost the hearing in his left ear and later also in his right. He retired in 1960 at only age 32, though not directly because of his hearing loss.

In , McDougald was given the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, which is awarded annually by the Phi Delta Theta fraternity (to which Gehrig belonged) at Columbia University.

His last appearance was in Game Seven of the 1960 World Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates; as a pinch runner in the top of the ninth, he scored on Yogi Berra&#x27;s ground ball to tie the game at 9–9. The Pirates, however, won the Series on Bill Mazeroski&#x27;s walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth.

On December 9, 1960, McDougald announced his retirement. McDougald said he made up his mind to retire during the World Series and that his inclusion by the Yankees on a list of players eligible to be selected in the 1960 Expansion Draft had nothing to do with his decision.

While with the Yankees, McDougald was a resident of Tenafly, New Jersey.

In 1336 games over 10 seasons, McDougald posted a .276 batting average (1291-for-4676) with 697 runs, 187 doubles, 51 triples, 112 home runs, 576 RBI, 45 stolen bases, 559 bases on balls, .356 on-base percentage and .410 slugging percentage. Defensively, he recorded a .975 fielding percentage playing at second and third base and shortstop. In 53 World Series games, he batted .237 (45-for-190) with 23 runs, 4 doubles, 1 triple, 7 home runs, 24 RBI, 2 stolen bases and 20 walks.

==Personal life==
McDougald was the head baseball coach at Fordham University from 1970 to 1976. He resigned this position due to his worsening hearing loss, a result of being hit in the head by a line drive during batting practice in 1955.

His hearing was somewhat restored by a cochlear implant he received during surgery at the New York University Medical Center in 1994. McDougald later became a paid spokesperson for the implant manufacturer, Cochlear Americas. He also became a speaker at benefits for hearing organizations, and testified before Congress.

McDougald died of prostate cancer at his home in Wall Township, New Jersey, at the age of 82. He was survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Lucille Tochilin (1928–2014), seven children, and 14 grandchildren.

Since then, one village was created (Mastic Beach in Suffolk County) and -42 villages were dissolved (including Mastic Beach, after only seven years of incorporation). Although still listed in the 2022 population estimates from the US Census, this includes the villages of South Nyack, New York (dissolved April 1, 2022), and Fort Johnson (dissolved December 31, 2023).

Most municipalities in New York are located within a single town and county, but some municipalities are located in more than one town. Of those, there are two cities and eight villages located in more than one county:

<doc id="535603" wikidata="Q1437520" url="?curid=535603" title="Caribbean (novel)">
<text>Caribbean (1989) is a historical novel written by James A. Michener, which describes and explores the history of the Caribbean region from the pre-Columbian period of the native Arawak tribes until about 1990.

The author mixes fact and fiction, as he notes in the foreword. For example, the story about the island of All Saints is purely fictional, though the book&#x27;s map shows it as an island in the location of Saint Lucia.

In researching the book, Michener traveled the Caribbean for three years and consulted over 400 books.

<text>The 1999 National Assembly for Wales election was held on Thursday 6 May 1999 to elect 60 members to the Senedd, at the time called the National Assembly for Wales (Welsh Parliament; ). It was the first devolved general election held in Wales after the successful 1997 Welsh devolution referendum. The election was held alongside the Scottish Parliament election (also the first of its kind) and English local elections.

Although Welsh Labour were the biggest party, they did not gain enough seats to form a majority government and instead entered into coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The election was marked by the historically high level of support for Plaid Cymru, who won their highest share of the vote in any Wales-wide election and remains their highest number of seats in a Senedd election to date. The party won considerable support in traditionally safe Labour areas such as the South Wales Valleys, winning Rhondda and Islwyn and narrowly failing to win a number of other seats.

The overall turnout of voters was 46.3%. This would remain the highest ever turnout for a devolved election in Wales until the 2021 Senedd election, which saw 46.6 of voters cast their ballot.

<doc id="535617" wikidata="Q5051850" url="?curid=535617" title="Category of metric spaces">
<text>In category theory, Met is a category that has metric spaces as its objects and metric maps (continuous functions between metric spaces that do not increase any pairwise distance) as its morphisms. This is a category because the composition of two metric maps is again a metric map. It was first considered by .

==Arrows==
The monomorphisms in Met are the injective metric maps. The epimorphisms are the metric maps for which the domain of the map has a dense image in the range. The isomorphisms are the isometries, i.e. metric maps which are injective, surjective, and distance-preserving.

As an example, the inclusion of the rational numbers into the real numbers is a monomorphism and an epimorphism, but it is clearly not an isomorphism; this example shows that Met is not a balanced category.

==Objects==
The empty metric space is the initial object of Met; any singleton metric space is a terminal object. Because the initial object and the terminal objects differ, there are no zero objects in Met.

The injective objects in Met are called injective metric spaces. Injective metric spaces were introduced and studied first by , prior to the study of Met as a category; they may also be defined intrinsically in terms of a Helly property of their metric balls, and because of this alternative definition Aronszajn and Panitchpakdi named these spaces &quot;hyperconvex spaces&quot;. Any metric space has a smallest injective metric space into which it can be isometrically embedded, called its metric envelope or tight span.

==Products and functors==
The product of a finite set of metric spaces in Met is a metric space that has the cartesian product of the spaces as its points; the distance in the product space is given by the supremum of the distances in the base spaces. That is, it is the product metric with the sup norm. However, the product of an infinite set of metric spaces may not exist, because the distances in the base spaces may not have a supremum. That is, Met is not a complete category, but it is finitely complete. There is no coproduct in Met.

The forgetful functor Met → Set assigns to each metric space the underlying set of its points, and assigns to each metric map the underlying set-theoretic function. This functor is faithful, and therefore Met is a concrete category.

==Related categories==
Met is not the only category whose objects are metric spaces; others include the category of uniformly continuous functions, the category of Lipschitz functions and the category of quasi-Lipschitz mappings. The metric maps are both uniformly continuous and Lipschitz, with Lipschitz constant at most one.

<doc id="535623" wikidata="Q1506107" url="?curid=535623" title="Trap street">
<text>In cartography, a trap street is a fictitious entry in the form of a misrepresented street on a map, often outside the area the map nominally covers, for the purpose of &quot;trapping&quot; potential plagiarists of the map who, if caught, would be unable to explain the inclusion of the &quot;trap street&quot; on their map as innocent. On maps that are not of streets, other &quot;trap&quot; features (such as nonexistent towns, or mountains with the wrong elevations) may be inserted or altered for the same purpose.

Trap streets are often nonexistent streets, but sometimes, rather than actually depicting a street where none exists, a map will misrepresent the nature of a street in a fashion that can still be used to detect copyright violators but is less likely to interfere with navigation. For instance, a map might add nonexistent bends to a street, or depict a major street as a narrow lane, without changing its location or its connections to other streets, or the trap street might be placed in an obscure location of a map that is unlikely to be referenced.

Trap streets are rarely acknowledged by publishers. One exception is a popular driver&#x27;s atlas for the city of Athens, Greece, which has a warning inside its front cover that potential copyright violators should beware of trap streets.

== Legal issues ==
Trap streets are not copyrightable under the federal law of the United States. In &quot;Nester&#x27;s Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.&quot; (1992), a United States federal court found that copyright traps are not themselves protectable by copyright. There, the court stated: &quot;[t]o treat &#x27;false&#x27; facts interspersed among actual facts and represented as actual facts as fiction would mean that no one could ever reproduce or copy actual facts without risk of reproducing a false fact and thereby violating a copyright ... If such were the law, information could never be reproduced or widely disseminated.&quot; (Id. at 733)

In a 2001 case, The Automobile Association in the United Kingdom agreed to settle a case for £20,000,000 when it was caught copying Ordnance Survey maps. In this case, the identifying &quot;fingerprints&quot; were not deliberate errors but rather stylistic features such as the width of roads.

In another case, the Singapore Land Authority sued Virtual Map, an online publisher of maps, for infringing on its copyright. The Singapore Land Authority stated in its case that there were deliberate errors in maps they had provided to Virtual Map years earlier. Virtual Map denied this and insisted that it had done its own cartography.

==Cultural references==
The 1979 science fiction novel &quot;The Ultimate Enemy&quot; by Fred Saberhagen includes the short story &quot;The Annihilation of Angkor Apeiron&quot; in which a salesman allows a draft of a new &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot; to be captured by alien war machines. It leads them to believe there is a nearby planet ripe for attack, but the planet is actually a copyright trap and the aliens are led away from inhabited worlds, saving millions of lives.

The 2010 novel &quot;Kraken&quot; by China Miéville features the trap streets of the &quot;London A-Z&quot; being places where the magical denizens of the city can exist without risk of being disturbed by normal folk.

A 2013 film, &quot;Trap Street&quot;, inverts the usual meaning of a &quot;trap street&quot;, becoming a real street which is deliberately obscured or removed from a map—and anyone who attempts to identify it by placing it on public record is then &quot;trapped&quot;.

The 2015 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Face the Raven&quot; features a hidden street where alien asylum seekers have taken shelter. Due to a psychic field that subconsciously makes observers ignore it, outsiders consider it a trap street when they see it on maps. One scene involves the character Clara Oswald discussing the definition of &quot;trap street&quot;. The episode&#x27;s working title was also &quot;Trap Street&quot;.

<doc id="535635" wikidata="Q1068224" url="?curid=535635" title="Rock Islands">
<text>The Rock Islands of Palau, also called &quot;Chelbacheb&quot;, are a collection of several hundred small limestone or coral uprises in the Southern Lagoon of Palau between Koror and Peleliu, now an incorporated part of Koror State. There are between 250 and 300 islands in the group according to different sources, with an aggregate area of and a maximum height of . The islands were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012.

== History ==
== Geography ==
The Rock Islands are sparsely populated and famous for their beaches, blue lagoons, and the peculiar umbrella-like shapes of many of the islands themselves. Many of the islands display a mushroom-like shape with a narrower base at the intertidal notch. The indentation comes from erosion and from the dense community of sponges, bivalves, chitons, snails, urchins, and others that graze mostly on algae. Also, the islands have been shaped over time by weather wind and vegetation. Notable islands in the group are:
*Eil Malk (Mecherchar)
*Ngeruktabel
*Ulong
*Bablomekang (Abappaomogan)
*Bukrrairong (Kamori)
*Oilouch
*Ongael
*Ngebedangel (Ngobasangel)
*Ngerukewid (Orukuizu)
*Ngeanges
*Ngeteklou (Gologugeul)
*Tlutkaraguis (Adorius)

==Environment==
===Important Bird Area===
A 4,912 ha site encompassing the Rock Islands has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of most of Palau’s endemic birds, including Micronesian megapodes, Palau ground doves, Micronesian imperial pigeons, Palau fruit doves, swiftlets and kingfishers, Micronesian myzomelas, morningbirds, Palau fantails, flycatchers and bush warblers, giant, dusky and citrine white-eyes, and Micronesian starlings.

== Tourism ==
The islands and surrounding reefs include Palau&#x27;s most popular tourist sites, such as the Blue Corner, Blue Holes, German Channel, Ngermeaus Island, and the famed Jellyfish Lake, one of many marine lakes in the Rock Islands that provides home and safety for several kinds of stingless jellyfish found only in Palau. It is the most popular diving destination in Palau, offering some of the most diverse dive sites on the planet, from wall diving and high current drift dives, to manta rays and sharkfeeds, to shallow lagoons, decorated caves, and overhangs. Tourist attractions also include Dolphin Bay, where a staff of veterinarians and trainers educate guests about dolphins.

== Demographics ==
The only inhabited place on the islands is called Dolphin Bay (on Ngeruktabel, 5 km from Koror). It is the location of Palau&#x27;s national aquatics park, and hosts headquarters of Palau&#x27;s Park rangers.

<text>Alexey Alexeyevich Troitsky (; March 14, 1866 – August 1942; also &quot;Alexei&quot;, &quot;Troitzky&quot;, &quot;Troitzki&quot;) was a Russian chess theoretician. He is widely considered to have been one of the greatest composers of chess endgame studies. He is widely regarded as the founder of the modern art of composing chess studies . Troitsky died of starvation during World War II at the siege of Leningrad. During the war, many of his notes got destroyed or lost so some of the latest chess problems he composed were never published.

One of his most famous works involves analyzing the endgame with two knights versus a pawn, see Troitsky line. John Nunn analyzed this endgame with an endgame tablebase and stated that &quot;the analysis of Troitsky ... is astonishingly accurate&quot; .

==Compositions==

Troitsky was a prolific composer of endgame studies. Irving Chernev included nine of them in . The diagram shows one of them.

<doc id="535647" wikidata="Q1239296" url="?curid=535647" title="Don Martin (cartoonist)">
<text>Don Martin (May 18, 1931 – January 6, 2000) was an American cartoonist whose best-known work was published in &quot;Mad&quot; from 1956 to 1988. His popularity and prominence were such that the magazine promoted Martin as &quot;Mad&#x27;s Maddest Artist.&quot;

==Early years==
Born on May 18, 1931, in Paterson, New Jersey, and raised in nearby Brookside and Morristown, Martin studied illustration and fine art at Newark School of Fine and Industrial Arts between 1949 and 1951 and subsequently graduated from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia in 1952. In 1953, he worked briefly as a window trimmer and frame maker before providing paste ups and mechanicals for various offset printing clients and beginning his career as freelance cartoonist and illustrator. Martin&#x27;s work first appeared in &quot;Mad&quot; in the September 1956 issue.

Martin suffered from eye problems his entire life. He underwent two corneal transplants: the first in 1949, at the age of 18, and the second forty years later in 1989. After the first procedure, Martin&#x27;s head had to be held in place for three days by a pair of sandbags to prevent movement.

Just prior to his work with &quot;Mad&quot;, Don Martin illustrated the album covers of a few legendary jazz artists for Prestige Records, including Miles Davis&#x27; 1956 album &quot;Miles Davis and Horns&quot; (Prestige LP 7025). He also did &quot;The Art Farmer Septet&quot; (Prestige LP 7031), &quot;Sonny Stitt / Bud Powell / J.J. Johnson&quot; (Prestige LP 7024), Kai Winding&#x27;s &quot;Trombone By Three&quot; (Prestige LP 7023) and Stan Getz&#x27; &quot;The Brothers&quot; (Prestige LP 7022). &quot;They&#x27;re still using these covers,&quot; Martin told the Orlando Sentinel in 1985. &quot;I got $50.&quot; He also drew greeting cards, and illustrations for jazz and science fiction magazines.

==Career with &quot;Mad&quot;==
Martin brought his portfolio to the &quot;Mad&quot; offices in 1956 and was immediately given an assignment. &quot;The drawings that I first brought to them were kind of tight,&quot; he later recalled. &quot;There was a very tight kind of design quality—I was using a very fine line. They encouraged me to loosen up a little bit and that&#x27;s what I did.&quot;

Martin often was billed as &quot;&quot;Mad&quot;&#x27;s Maddest Artist.&quot; Whereas other features in &quot;Mad&quot;, recurring or otherwise, typically were headed with pun-filled &quot;department&quot; titles, Martin&#x27;s work always was headed with only his name—&quot;Don Martin Dept.&quot;—further fanfare presumably being unnecessary.

At his peak, each issue of &quot;Mad&quot; typically carried three Martin strips of one or two pages each. But Martin also did several longer pieces, including parodies of poems by writers like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Edgar Guest and Clement Clarke Moore, thematic collections of gags on a single subject such as Moses, superheroes or Dracula, as well as full parodies of the &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; TV series and the films &quot;Excalibur&quot; and &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. He also drew some insert bonus material for &quot;Mad Specials&quot; such as stickers and posters.

Although Martin&#x27;s contributions invariably featured outrageous events and sometimes outright violations of the laws of space-time, his strips typically had unassuming generic titles such as &quot;A Quiet Day in the Park&quot; or &quot;One Afternoon at the Beach.&quot; The six-panel &quot;The Impressionist&quot; features a bull who becomes a famous artist by smearing an outdoor painter against his canvas and displaying his remains as an abstract design. The four-panel &quot;One Night in the Miami Bus Terminal&quot; presents a man who approaches a machine labeled &quot;Change,&quot; inserts a dollar bill, and changes to a woman. In another gag, a man is flattened by a steamroller but is saved by the intervention of two passersby, who fold him as a paper airplane and throw him to the nearest hospital.

==Style and technique==

Martin&#x27;s immediately recognizable drawing style (which featured bulbous noses and the iconic hinged foot) was loose, rounded, and filled with broad slapstick. His inspirations, plots, and themes were often bizarre and at times bordered on the berserk. In his earliest years with &quot;Mad&quot;, Martin used a more jagged, scratchy line. His style evolved, settling into its familiar form by 1964. It was typified by a sameness in the appearance of the characters (the punchline to a strip often was emphasized by a deadpan take with eyes half open and the mouth absent or in a tight, small circle of steadfast perplexity) and by an endless capacity for newly coined, onomatopoetic sound effects, such as &quot;BREEDEET BREEDEET&quot; for a croaking frog, &quot;PLORTCH&quot; for a knight being stabbed by a sword, or &quot;FAGROON klubble klubble&quot; for a collapsing building. (Martin&#x27;s dedication to onomatopoeia was such that he owned a vanity license plate which read &quot;SHTOINK,&quot; patterned after the style of his famed sound effects.)

In a 1981 interview with the magazine Cartoonist Profiles, Martin discussed his theory of sound effects: 
“When other people try to write a Don Martin sound effect for me, they don’t do it correctly. Most of the time they put in a bunch of arbitrary letters that don’t mean anything at all...I can tell that they aren’t thinking about what the sound would really be like. 

For example, if they do somebody getting hit on the head with a crowbar, they will go “groink.” Now, that’s not a crowbar landing on the head! The sound would have a clang to it, “pwang” or “spwang.” “Spwang” would mean the skull is soft, because it has a wet sound to it. The sound wouldn’t be “groink.” “Groink” is when you put two fingers in someone’s nose and pull it about six inches from the front of the face. That’s “groink”! ...It wouldn’t be just a bunch of letters. I figure the sounds out. In other words, I really do think about them and each sound has its own inner logic.” 

His characters often had ridiculous, rhyming names such as Fester Bestertester or Fonebone (which was expanded to Freenbean I. Fonebone in at least one strip), as well as Lance Parkertip, Noted Notary Public. In this middle period, Martin created some of his most absurdist work—for example, &quot;National Gorilla Suit Day&quot;—an extended narrative in which a hapless character is violently assaulted by a series of attackers in various disguises, including gorillas dressed as men. Charles Taylor described Martin&#x27;s unique art style:

His people are big-nosed schmoes with sleepy eyes, puffs of wiry hair, and what appear to be life preservers under the waistline of their clothes. Their hands make delicate little mincing gestures and their strangely thin, elongated feet take a 90-degree turn at the toes as they step forward. Whether they’re average Joes or headhunters, Martin’s people share the same physique: a tottering tower of obloids. Martin puts the bodies of these characters through every kind of permutation, treating them as much like gadgets as the squirting flowers and joy buzzers that populate his gags: glass eyes pop out from a pat on the back; heads are steamrollered into manhole-cover shapes. All of this accompanied by a Dadaist panoply of sound effects found nowhere else: shtoink! shklorp! fwoba-dap! It’s unlikely Samuel Beckett was aware of Don Martin, but had he been he might have recognized a kindred spirit.

His work probably reached its final peak of quality and technical detail in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Though Martin described his art style to an interviewer in 1985: &quot;It&#x27;s still evolving, it&#x27;s still changing.&quot; In later years, particularly during the 1980s, he let other people write most of his gags, most notably Duck Edwing.

Concurrent with his &quot;Mad&quot; output, Martin and an assortment of writers produced a series of paperback books, to which he retained the copyrights and eventual publishing rights. For this reason, the content of these books was not included in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Completely Mad Don Martin&quot; box set. Martin described his heavy workload for these projects:

Once I get the OK on the roughs I start the finished drawings. I sort of begin this stage slowly, because doing the finished work always ends up being a seven-day week. An all day, and all evening ordeal. I always anticipate I can draw the books faster than I can. That is a big mistake, since it adds a lot of anxiety, and aggravation to the project. I thought I had developed a system with the last one. I worked on the book in batches of 15 pages or so. I even kept a record to see how long it took me to do the pencils, and how long it took me to do the inks, but it still ended up being seven days a week for a couple of months. I find I have to get some momentum going when I draw. I can&#x27;t work with interruptions. I like to have three or four days where I don&#x27;t even leave the house on an errand. I get a lot more done that way, because I build up a head of steam.

==Post-&quot;Mad&quot; work==
In his last years of working with &quot;Mad&quot;, Martin had a falling out with publisher William Gaines over royalties for the paperback compilations of older &quot;Mad&quot; articles and cartoons released under new omnibus titles, such as &quot;The Self-Made Mad.&quot; Gaines insisted that Martin&#x27;s original page rate was for both publication in &quot;Mad&quot; and all future reprints in any format. Martin objected, claiming at one point that he had likely lost over $1 million in royalties because of this &quot;flat rate&quot; for this work. Martin later testified before a Congressional subcommittee on the rights of freelance artists.

With bad blood flowing in both directions, Martin left &quot;Mad&quot; in late 1987. His last contribution appeared in issue No. 277 of March 1988 (&quot;One Special Day in the Dungeon&quot;, written by Antonio Prohías). Soon afterwards, he began cartooning for the rival humor publication &quot;Cracked&quot;, which alluded to Martin&#x27;s defection from its larger competitor by billing Martin as &quot;&quot;Cracked&quot;″s Crackedest Artist&quot;. Martin&#x27;s debut cover for &quot;Cracked&quot;, issue 235, was pointedly signed &quot;©1988 D. Martin&quot;.

&quot;As far as I could tell, he was happy,&quot; said fellow &quot;Cracked&quot; artist Dan Clowes. &quot;I don&#x27;t think he ever seemed to notice that &quot;Mad&quot; was respected, whereas &quot;Cracked&quot; was loathed.&quot;

After six years with &quot;Cracked&quot;, Martin parted company with the magazine. A year later, he launched his own short-lived publication, &quot;Don Martin Magazine&quot;. This included reprints from some of his original &quot;Mad&quot; paperbacks to which he had retained copyrights. The first issue included an otherwise nonsensical Martin &quot;interview&quot; conducted by Martin himself, in which he said, &quot;My agent thinks I was nuts to have worked there [&quot;Mad&quot;] as long as I did,&quot; before expressing fondness for his time at &quot;Cracked&quot;. In 1991, Martin complained about &quot;Mad&quot;″s chummy and tribal atmosphere to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s looked upon by the people there as a good thing, like one big family. I came to realize that it&#x27;s only a good thing for Bill Gaines. I was so terribly loyal all those years that I turned down work because I had something for &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;—which is ridiculous.&quot;

From 1989 to 1993, Don Martin created a daily comic strip called &quot;The Nutheads&quot;, featuring a family that worked at &quot;Glump&#x27;s Market,&quot; a cluttered store. The characters included a mother and father, Hazel and Nutley, and their two children, Macadamia and baby Nutkin. It was briefly syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate; Martin later revived and self-syndicated the strip.

Despite a degenerative eye condition, Martin continued to draw through the 1990s using special magnifying equipment.

Martin was a member of both the National Cartoonists Society and The Graphic Artists Guild (GAG). He resigned from GAG and returned a donation from them in 1997, following a dispute.

==Personal life and death==

In 1972, after sitting for an interview with &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, the newspaper wanted to take a photograph of Martin and his family to accompany the piece. Martin refused. However, he then drew impromptu life-sized character masks, which Martin, his wife Rosemary, and son Max obligingly wore over their faces for the published portrait.

He remarried in 1979, taking Norma Haimes (Martin) as his new wife. Their marriage lasted until his death.

In 2000, he died of cancer in Coconut Grove, Florida at age 68.

==Awards and honors==
Martin was honored with the Ignatz Award at the Orlando Comicon in 1980. He received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Special Features Award in both 1981 and 1982, and he was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2004.

Martin&#x27;s cartoons appear in public collections at the National Cartoonists Society and the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library &amp; Museum. He served as a juror at &quot;Hürriyet Vakfı,&quot; an International Cartoon Competition held in Ankara, Turkey in 1986.

==Influence on popular culture==
Martin&#x27;s work has been referenced in numerous arenas, from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Family Guy&quot; to &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; to Jonathan Lethem&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot;, which describes in detail the Tourette&#x27;s-afflicted protagonist&#x27;s affinity for Martin&#x27;s cartoons. The character of Uncle Grandpa was inspired by the look of Martin&#x27;s designs.

In 1986, the animated feature &quot;Don Martin Does It Again&quot; was created in Germany by director Andy Knight, and produced by Gerhard Hahn&#x27;s Deutsche Zeichentrick Erste Produktions GmbH &amp; Co. KG. It won first prize at the 1986 International Children&#x27;s Film Festival in Chicago. Martin strips have also been adapted on Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Mad&quot; and the Fox sketch program &quot;MADtv.&quot;

The name of the Fone Bone character in cartoonist Jeff Smith&#x27;s epic graphic novel &quot;Bone&quot; is derived from Fonebone, the generic surname that Martin gave to many of the characters that appeared in his &quot;Mad&quot; magazine strips.

In episode No. 307, &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Stupid&quot; (2001), of Matt Groening&#x27;s science-fiction animated television series &quot;Futurama&quot;, lead character Hermes Conrad mentions a planet called &quot;Don Martin 3&quot; that went &quot;kerflooey&quot;, an homage to one of Martin&#x27;s sound effects. The &quot;Stranded in Space&quot; film shown on TV&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (episode 305) included various visual weapon sound effects (e.g., a gun with a flag which pops out, bearing the sound effect &quot;BANG!&quot;). After a stick of dynamite produced a banner reading &quot;KACHOW&quot;, one of the show&#x27;s characters wondered, &quot;Kachow? &quot;Kachow?!&quot; What, is Don Martin working with you guys now?!&quot;

In 2007, a two-volume hardcover box set of Martin&#x27;s complete &quot;Mad&quot; magazine work was published by Running Press.

Taking their cue from one of Martin&#x27;s more celebrated stories, &quot;National Gorilla Suit Day&quot;, fans have celebrated National Gorilla Suit Day by wearing gorilla suits on January 31. No specific date is given in the story, which appeared in the 1963 paperback book &quot;Don Martin Bounces Back&quot;.

<text>Louisiana is a state located in the Southern United States. According to the 2020 United States census, Louisiana is the 25th most populous state with inhabitants and the 33rd largest by land area spanning of land. Louisiana is divided into 64 parishes, which are equivalent to counties, and contains 304 municipalities consisting of four consolidated city-parishes, 64 cities, 130 towns, and 106 villages. Louisiana&#x27;s municipalities cover only of the state&#x27;s land mass but are home to of its population.

According to the 2015 Louisiana Laws Revised Statutes, residents of any unincorporated area may propose to incorporate as a municipality if the area meets prescribed minimum population thresholds. Municipal corporations are divided based on population into three classes: cities, towns, and villages. Those having five thousand inhabitants or more are classified as cities; those having less than five thousand but more than one thousand inhabitants are classified as towns; and those having one thousand or fewer inhabitants are classified as villages. The governor may change the classification of the municipality if the board of aldermen requests a change and a census shows that the population has increased or decreased making it eligible for a different classification. Municipalities are granted powers to perform functions required by local governments including the levy and collection of taxes and to assume indebtedness.

The largest municipality by population in Louisiana in 2020 is New Orleans with 383,997 residents, and the smallest is Mound with 12 residents. The largest municipality by land area is New Orleans, which spans , while Napoleonville is the smallest at . The first municipality to incorporate was Natchitoches in 1712 and the newest is Central in 2005.

<text>A country&#x27;s gross external debt (or foreign debt) is the liabilities that are owed to nonresidents by residents. The debtors can be governments, corporations or citizens. External debt may be denominated in domestic or foreign currency. It includes amounts owed to private commercial banks, foreign governments, or international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. 

External debt measures an economy&#x27;s obligations to make future payments and, therefore, is an indicator of a country&#x27;s vulnerability to solvency and liquidity problems. Another useful indicator is the &quot;net&quot; external debt position, which equals gross external debt minus external assets in the form of debt instruments. A related concept is the net international investment position (net IIP). Provided that debt securities are measured at market value, the net external debt position equals the net IIP excluding equity and investment fund shares, financial derivatives, and employee stock options.

==Definition==
According to the International Monetary Fund&#x27;s &quot;External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users&quot;, &quot;Gross external debt, at any given time, is the outstanding amount of those actual current, and not contingent, liabilities that require payment(s) of principal and/or interest by the debtor at some point(s) in the future and that are owed to nonresidents by residents of an economy.&quot; 

In this definition, the IMF defines the key elements as follows:
;Outstanding and actual current liabilities: Debt liabilities include arrears of both principal and interest.
;Principal and interest: When the cost of borrowing is paid periodically, as commonly occurs, it is known as an interest payment. All other payments of economic value by the debtor to the creditor that reduce the principal amount outstanding are known as principal payments. However, the definition of external debt does not distinguish between principal payments or interest payments, or payments for both. Also, the definition does not specify that the timing of the future payments of principal and/or interest need be known for a liability to be classified as debt. 
;Residence: To qualify as external debt, the debt liabilities must be owed by a resident to a nonresident. Residence is determined by where the debtor and creditor have their centers of economic interest—typically, where they are ordinarily located—and not by their nationality. 
;Current and not contingent: Contingent liabilities are not included in the definition of external debt. These are defined as arrangements under which one or more conditions must be fulfilled before a financial transaction takes place. However, from the viewpoint of understanding vulnerability, there is analytical interest in the potential impact of contingent liabilities on an economy and on particular institutional sectors, such as the government.

Generally, external debt is classified into four heads:
:(1) public and publicly guaranteed debt;
:(2) private non-guaranteed credits;
:(3) central bank deposits; and
:(4) loans due to the IMF.

However, the exact treatment varies from country to country. For example, while Egypt maintains this four-head classification, in India it is classified in seven heads:
:(a) Multilateral,
:(b) Bilateral,
:(c) IMF loans,
:(d) Trade credit,
:(e) Commercial borrowings,
:(f) Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin deposits,
:(g) Rupee debt, and
:(h) NPR debt.

==External debt sustainability==
Sustainable debt is the level of debt which allows a debtor country to meet its current and future debt service obligations in full, without recourse to further debt relief or rescheduling, avoiding accumulation of arrears, while allowing an acceptable level of economic growth.

External-debt-sustainability analysis is generally conducted in the context of medium-term scenarios. These scenarios are numerical evaluations that take account of expectations of the behavior of economic variables and other factors to determine the conditions under which debt and other indicators would stabilize at reasonable levels, the major risks to the economy, and the need and scope for policy adjustment. In these analyses, macroeconomic uncertainties, such as the outlook for the current account, and policy uncertainties, such as for fiscal policy, tend to dominate the medium-term outlook.

The World Bank and IMF hold that &quot;a country can be said to achieve external debt sustainability if it can meet its current and future external debt service obligations in full, without recourse to debt rescheduling or the accumulation of arrears and without compromising growth&quot;. According to these two institutions, &quot;bringing the net present value (NPV) of external public debt down to about 150 percent of a country&#x27;s exports or 250 percent of a country&#x27;s revenues&quot; would help eliminating this &quot;critical barrier to longer-term debt sustainability&quot;. High external debt is believed to be harmful for the economy.

===Indicators===

There are various indicators for determining a sustainable level of external debt. While each has its own advantage and peculiarity to deal with particular situations, there is no unanimous opinion amongst economists as to a sole indicator. These indicators are primarily in the nature of ratios—i.e., comparison between two heads and the relation thereon and thus facilitate the policy makers in their external debt management exercise. These indicators can be thought of as measures of the country&#x27;s &quot;solvency&quot; in that they consider the stock of debt at certain time in relation to the country&#x27;s ability to generate resources to repay the outstanding balance.

Examples of debt burden indicators include the
:(a) Debt-to-GDP ratio,
:(b) foreign debt to exports ratio,
:(c) government debt to current fiscal revenue ratio etc.
This set of indicators also covers the structure of the outstanding debt, including:
:(d) Share of foreign debt,
:(e) Short-term debt, and
:(f) Concessional debt (&quot;loans with an original grant element of 25 percent or more&quot;) in the total debt stock.

A second set of indicators focuses on the short-term liquidity requirements of the country with respect to its debt service obligations. These indicators are not only useful early-warning signs of debt service problems, but also highlight the impact of the inter-temporal trade-offs arising from past borrowing decisions. Examples of liquidity monitoring indicators include the
:(a) Debt service to GDP ratio,
:(b) Foreign debt service to exports ratio,
:(c) Government debt service to current fiscal revenue ratio
The final indicators are more forward-looking, as they point out how the debt burden will evolve over time, given the current stock of data and average interest rate. The dynamic ratios show how the debt-burden ratios would change in the absence of repayments or new disbursements, indicating the stability of the debt burden. An example of a dynamic ratio is the ratio of the average interest rate on outstanding debt to the growth rate of nominal GDP.

<text>Brodmann area 37, or BA37, is part of the temporal cortex in the human brain. It contains the fusiform gyrus which in turn contains the fusiform face area, an area important for the recognition of faces.

This area is also known as occipitotemporal area 37 (H). It is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined temporal region of cerebral cortex. It is located primarily in the caudal portions of the fusiform gyrus and inferior temporal gyrus on the mediobasal and lateral surfaces at the caudal extreme of the temporal lobe. Cytoarchitecturally, it is bounded caudally by the peristriate Brodmann area 19, rostrally by the inferior temporal area 20 and middle temporal area 21, and dorsally on the lateral aspect of the hemisphere by the angular area 39 (H) (Brodmann-1909).

<text>Brodmann area 38, also BA38 or temporopolar area 38 (H), is part of the temporal cortex in the human brain. BA 38 is at the anterior end of the temporal lobe, known as the temporal pole.

BA38 is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined temporal region of cerebral cortex. It is located primarily in the most rostral portions of the superior temporal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded caudally by the inferior temporal area 20, the middle temporal area 21, the superior temporal area 22 and the ectorhinal area 36 (Brodmann-1909).

The temporal pole is a paralimbic region involved in high level semantic representation and socio-emotional processing. The uncinate fasciculus provides a direct bidirectional path to the orbitofrontal cortex, allowing mnemonic representations stored in the temporal pole to bias decision making in the frontal lobe. The temporal pole appears to be a convergence zone where concepts (also known as semantic memories) that are stored in the ventral anterior temporal lobe are imbued with emotional significance and personal meaning. In addition, concepts of individual people, abstracted away from the perceptual representations, are stored in a “face patch” in the temporal pole. This face patch is found in both non-human primates and humans. This relates to early work showing that damage to the temporal pole can cause an amnestic prosopagnosia in which recognition of familiar faces is lost. 

Bilateral damage to the temporal poles, though rare, can cause dramatic changes in personality. Klüver-Bucy syndrome involves damage to the greater temporal pole as well as the amygdala. In this disorder, people and animals demonstrate fearlessness, hypersexuality, and hyperorality. 

This area is among the earliest affected by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, frontotemporal dementia, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and is commonly involved at the start of temporal lobe seizures.

Cytoarchitectonic and chemoarchitectonic studies find that it contains at least seven subareas, one of which, &quot;TG&quot;, is unique to humans.

<text>Genrikh Kasparyan (Surname also spelled Kasparian) (27 February 1910 – 27 December 1995) was an Armenian chess player. He is considered to have been one of the greatest composers of chess endgame studies.

Kasparyan became a national master in 1936 and an international master in 1950. He was awarded the titles of International Judge of Chess Compositions in 1956 and International Grandmaster of Chess Composition in 1972, the first composer to receive this title from FIDE .

Kasparyan was also a very strong chess player, winning the Armenian championship ten times (from 1934 to 1956, including two ties with future world champion Tigran Petrosian) and the Tiflis championship three times (1931, 1937, 1945). He reached the USSR Championship finals four times (1931, 1937, 1947, 1952), but never finished higher than tenth place.

Kasparyan is best known for his compositions. He started with chess problems, mainly , but soon discovered that his best field was in endgame studies. He wrote several books and collections and composed about 600 studies, many on the theme of domination, winning 57 first prizes. He won the USSR Composing Championship several times .
== Sample study ==
Irving Chernev included five of Kasparyan&#x27;s compositions in his book &quot;200 Brilliant Endgames&quot;. This study uses a &quot;model mate&quot; in the middle of the board. 


== Most famous combination from practical play ==
Apart from being a prolific composer of chess problems Kasparyan was, as mentioned above, an excellent tournament player. One of his games, Genrikh Kasparyan–Koryun Manvelyan, Armenian Championship, Yerevan 1938, has found its way into countless books on chess tactics:

<text>Hermann Cohen (; ; 4 July 1842 – 4 April 1918) was a German philosopher, one of the founders of the Marburg school of neo-Kantianism, and he is often held to be &quot;probably the most important Jewish philosopher of the nineteenth century&quot;.

==Biography==
Cohen was born in Coswig, in the Principality of Anhalt-Bernburg. He began to study philosophy early on, and soon became known as a profound Kant scholar. He was educated at the Gymnasium at Dessau, at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau, and at the universities of Breslau, Berlin, and Halle. In 1873, he became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in the philosophical faculty of the University of Marburg; the thesis with which he obtained the &quot;venia legendi&quot; being &quot;Die systematischen Begriffe in Kant&#x27;s vorkritischen Schriften nach ihrem Verhältniss zum kritischen Idealismus&quot;. Cohen was elected Professor extraordinarius at Marburg in 1875 and Professor ordinarius the following year.

He was one of the founders of the &quot;Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaft des Judenthums&quot;, which held its first meeting in Berlin in November 1902.

Cohen edited and published Friedrich Albert Lange&#x27;s final philosophical work, &quot;Logische Studien&quot; (Leipzig, 1877), and edited and wrote several versions of a long introduction and critical supplement to Lange&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte des Materialismus&quot;.

He devoted three early volumes to the interpretation of Kant (&quot;Kant&#x27;s Theory of Experience&quot;, &quot;Kant&#x27;s Foundations of Ethics&quot;, and &quot;Kant&#x27;s Foundations of Aesthetics&quot;). In 1902 he began publishing the three volumes of his own systematic philosophy: &quot;Logik der reinen Erkenntnis&quot; (1902), &quot;Ethik des reinen Willens&quot; (1904) and &quot;Ästhetik des reinen Gefühls&quot; (1912). The planned fourth volume on psychology was never written.

Cohen&#x27;s writings relating more especially to Judaism include several pamphlets, among them &quot;Die Kulturgeschichtliche Bedeutung des Sabbat&quot; (1881) and &quot;Ein Bekenntniss in der Judenfrage&quot; (1880); as well as the following articles: &quot;Das Problem der Jüdischen Sittenlehre&quot; in the &quot;Monatsschrift&quot; xliii. (1899), pp. 385–400, 433–449; &quot;Liebe und Gerechtigkeit in den Begriffen Gott und Mensch&quot; in &quot;Jahrbuch für Jüdische Geschichte und Litteratur&quot;, III. (1900), pp. 75–132; and &quot;Autonomie und Freiheit&quot; in &quot;Gedenkbuch für David Kaufmann&quot; (1900).

Cohen&#x27;s most famous Jewish works include: &quot;Religion der Vernunft aus den Quellen des Judentums&quot; (&quot;Religion of Reason out of the Sources of Judaism&quot;, 1919), &quot;Deutschtum und Judentum&quot;, &quot;Die Naechstenliebe im Talmud&quot;, and &quot;Die Ethik des Maimonides&quot;.
His essay &quot;Die Nächstenliebe im Talmud&quot; was written at the request of the Marburg Königliches Landgericht (3d ed., Marburg, 1888).
Cohen&#x27;s Jewish writings are collected in his &quot;Jüdische Schriften&quot; (3 vols. ed. Bruno Strauss, Berlin 1924). There is an ongoing new academic edition of Cohen&#x27;s works, edited by Helmut Holzhey, Hartwig Wiedebach u.a. (Olms, Hildesheim 1977 ff.). Selected writings have published in English translation in &quot;Hermann Cohen: Writings on Neo-Kantianism and Jewish Philosophy&quot; (ed. by Samuel Moyn and Robert S. Schine, 2021) and in &quot;Reason and Hope: Selections from the Jewish Writings of Hermann Cohen&quot;, translated by Eva Jospe (1971).

Cohen was an outspoken critic of Zionism, as he argued that its aspiration to create a Jewish state would lead to &quot;return the Jews to History&quot;. In his view, Judaism was inherently a-historical, with a spiritual and moral mission far transcending the national aims of Zionism.
Despite his attitude, Tel Aviv has a Hermann Cohen Street.

Cohen is buried in the Weißensee Cemetery in Berlin.

<text>Brodmann area 39, or BA39, is part of the parietal cortex in the human brain. BA39 encompasses the angular gyrus, lying near to the junction of temporal, occipital and parietal lobes.

This area is also known as angular area 39 (H). It corresponds to the angular gyrus surrounding the caudal tip of the superior temporal sulcus. It is bounded dorsally approximately by the intraparietal sulcus. In terms of its cytoarchitecture, it is bounded rostrally by the supramarginal area 40 (H), dorsally and caudally by the peristriate area 19, and ventrally by the occipitotemporal area 37 (H) (Brodmann-1909).

==Function==

Area 39 was regarded by Alexander Luria as a part of the parietal-temporal-occipital area, which includes Brodmann area 40, Brodmann area 19, and Brodmann area 37.
Damage to the left Brodmann area 39 may result in dyslexia or in semantic aphasia. Albert Einstein had less neurones (relative to glial cells) in this (left sided) area than normal. 
The right Brodmann area 39 appears to play a role in body image because electrical stimulation of the right angular gyrus induces an &#x27;out-of-body&#x27; experience.

<text>The yale or centicore (Latin: &quot;eale&quot;) is a mythical beast found in European mythology and heraldry.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;yale&quot; is believed to be derived from the Hebrew word יָעֵל (&quot;yael&quot;), meaning &quot;ibex&quot;. Other common names are &quot;eale&quot; or &quot;centicore&quot;.
The Septuagint translation of Job 39:1 rendered the word יָעֵל as τραγελάφων (&quot;trageláphōn&quot;), which referred to the mythical tragelaphus, a half-goat half-stag, which in 1816 gave its name to a genus of antelope Tragelaphus.

==Description==
The yale is described as an antelope- or goat-like creature with the tusks of a boar and large horns. These horns possess the ability to swivel in any direction which makes them good for both offensive and defensive attacks.

The yale was first written about by Pliny the Elder in Book VIII of his &quot;Natural History&quot;. He describes the &quot;eale&quot; as a creature found in Aethiopia: 

Pliny reports sighting the yale while on the sub-Saharan African plains. The antelope and buffalo inhabit this region and loosely match his description, so may have given rise to his misunderstanding.
The yale subsequently featured in medieval bestiaries and heraldry.

==Heraldry==

The yale is among the heraldic beasts used by the British Royal Family. It was used as a supporter for the arms of John, Duke of Bedford, and by England&#x27;s House of Beaufort. Its connection with the British monarchy began with Henry VII in 1485. Henry Tudor’s mother, Lady Margaret (1443–1509), was a Beaufort, and the Beaufort heraldic legacy inherited by both her and her son included the yale.

Lady Margaret Beaufort was a benefactor of Cambridge&#x27;s Christ&#x27;s College and St John&#x27;s College, and her yale can be seen on the college gatehouses. There are also a pair on the roof of St George&#x27;s Chapel in Windsor Castle. The Yale of Beaufort was one of the Queen&#x27;s Beasts commissioned for the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953: the plaster originals are in Canada, while stone copies are at Kew Gardens, outside the palm house.

In the US, the yale is associated with Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Although the school&#x27;s primary sports mascot is a bulldog named Handsome Dan, the yale can be found throughout the university campus. The mythical beast occupies two quadrants of the coat of arms of the Yale Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS). The yale is also depicted on the official banner of the president of the university, which, along with a wooden mace capped by a yale&#x27;s head, is carried and displayed during commencement exercises each spring. Yales can also be seen above the gateway to Yale&#x27;s Davenport College and the pediment of Timothy Dwight College.

<doc id="535678" wikidata="Q5432178" url="?curid=535678" title="Historiography of the Ottoman Empire">
<text>The historiography of the Ottoman Empire refers to the studies, sources, critical methods and interpretations used by scholars to develop a history of the Ottoman Dynasty&#x27;s empire.

Scholars have long studied the Empire, looking at the causes for its formation (such as the Ghaza thesis), its relations to the Great Powers (such as Sick man of Europe) and other empires (such as Transformation of the Ottoman Empire), and the kinds of people who became imperialists or anti-imperialists (such as the Young Turks), together with their mindsets. The history of the breakdown of the Empire (such as Ottoman decline thesis) has attracted scholars of the histories of the Middle East (such as Partition of the Ottoman Empire), and Greece (Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire).

== New Themes ==

Western understanding of the Ottoman History. Ottoman history has been rewritten for political and cultural advantage and speculative theories rife with inconsistent research, ahistorical assumptions and embedded biases. Partly because the archives are moderately new. The Ottoman Archives are a collection of historical sources related to the Ottoman Empire and a total of 39 nations whose territories one time or the other were part of this Empire, including 19 nations in the Middle East, 11 in the EU and Balkans, three in the Caucasus, two in Central Asia, Cyprus, as well as Palestine and the Republic of Turkey. Ottoman Bank Archives and Research Centre operated in the former Head Office of the Ottoman Bank

Regarding the Ottoman Industrial Revolution, Edward Clark said, Ottoman responses to this European economic challenge are relatively unknown, and even the extensive and costly Ottoman industrial efforts of the 1840s seemingly have been dismissed as the casual, if not comical games of disinterested bureaucrats... What were the nature and magnitude of these Ottoman responses? What were Ottoman objectives? What main factors contributed to their failures? What if any achievements resulted?

== Establishment of the Empire ==

Osman&#x27;s Dream is a mythological story relating to the life of Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Empire. The story describes a dream experienced by Osman while staying in the home of a religious figure, Sheikh Edebali, in which he sees a metaphorical vision predicting the growth and prosperity of an empire to be ruled by him and his descendants. However there are other thesis addresses the question of how the Ottomans were able to expand from a small principality on the frontier of the Byzantine Empire into a centralized, intercontinental empire. According to the Ghaza thesis, the Ottomans accomplished this by attracting recruits to fight for them in the name of Islamic holy war against the non-believers. Such a warrior was known in Turkish as a &quot;ghazi&quot;, and thus this thesis sees the early Ottoman state as a &quot;Ghazi State,&quot; defined by an ideology of holy war. The Ghaza Thesis dominated early Ottoman historiography throughout much of the twentieth century before coming under increasing criticism beginning in the 1980s. Historians now generally reject the Ghaza Thesis, and consequently the idea that Ottoman expansion was primarily fueled by holy war, but are conflicted with regard to what to replace it with.

== Effect of nationalism ==

In seeking new identities and ideological foundations for their states, Arabs and Turks invoked ancient history: the Pharaohs, Kings of Babylon, and the Hittites of pre-Ottoman Anatolia. This could involve hostility and often vilification, not so much regarding specific Ottoman policies but more about state building processes. Doumani’s study of the Arab region of Ottoman Palestine notes: &quot;most Arab nationalists view the entire Ottoman era as a period of oppressive Turkish rule which stifled Arab culture and socioeconomic development and paved the way for European colonial control and the Zionist takeover of Palestine.&quot; The 19th- and early 20th-century literature written by Westerners bent on &quot;discovering&quot; the Holy Land—that is, reclaiming it from what they believed was a stagnant and declining Ottoman Empire—provided the intellectual foundation for this shared image.

== Collapse of the Empire ==

Many twentieth-century scholars argued that power of the Ottoman Empire began waning after the death of Suleiman the Magnificent in 1566, and without the acquisition of significant new wealth the empire went into decline, a concept known as the Ottoman Decline Thesis. Since the late 1970s, however, historians increasingly came to question the idea of Ottoman decline, and now there is a consensus among academic historians that the Ottoman Empire did not decline.

<text>The University of Wyoming (UW) is a public land-grant research university in Laramie, Wyoming, United States. It was founded in March 1886, four years before the territory was admitted as the 44th state, and opened in September 1887. The University of Wyoming&#x27;s location is written into the state&#x27;s constitution. The university also offers outreach education in communities throughout Wyoming and online.

The University of Wyoming consists of seven colleges: agriculture and natural resources, arts and sciences, business, education, engineering and applied sciences, health sciences, and law. The university offers over 120 undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs including Doctor of Pharmacy and Juris Doctor. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High research activity&quot;.

In addition to on-campus classes in Laramie, the university&#x27;s Outreach School offers more than 41 degree, certificate and endorsement programs to distance learners across the state and beyond. These programs are delivered through the use of technology, such as online and video conferencing classes. The Outreach School has nine regional centers in the state, with several on community college campuses, to give Wyoming residents access to a university education without relocating to Laramie.

==Campus==

===Old Main===

On September 27, 1886, the cornerstone of Old Main was laid, marking the beginning of the University of Wyoming. The stone is inscribed &quot;Domi Habuit Unde Disceret&quot;, which is often translated, &quot;He need not go away from home for instruction.&quot; The following year, the first class of 42 men and women began their college education. For the next decade, the building housed classrooms, a library, and administration offices.

The style of Old Main set a precedent for all future university buildings. The main stone is rough-cut sandstone from a quarry east of Laramie, and the trim stone is smooth Potsdam Sandstone from a quarry near Rawlins. Old Main was supposed to be a monumental structure, and it was designed to be symmetrical, with a prominent central spire as the focal point. The building was also meant to reflect the character of Wyoming, and the rough stone and smooth trim represented the progressing frontier. The design of Old Main had a lasting effect on university structures, most visible in the use of a sandstone façade on nearly every building.

In 1916, the university removed the central spire because of structural concerns. The size of auditorium was reduced during a 1936 renovation. In 1949, the university thoroughly remodeled the building and completely removed the auditorium and exterior stairs. At that time, it officially became known as Old Main, and the name was carved above the east entrance. Old Main houses university administration, including the president&#x27;s office and the boardroom where the trustees often meet.

===Prexy&#x27;s Pasture===
Prexy&#x27;s Pasture is a large grassy area located within a ring of classroom and administrative buildings and serves as the center mall of the campus. The name is attributed to an obscure rule that the university president, or &quot;prexy&quot;, is given exclusive use of the area for livestock grazing. During the administration of Arthur G. Crane, the name &quot;Prexy&#x27;s Pasture&quot; was formally declared. Prexy&#x27;s, as it is often called today, is also known for the unique pattern formed by concrete pathways that students and faculty use to cross it.

When the University of Wyoming first opened its doors in 1887, Prexy&#x27;s Pasture was nothing more than an actual pasture covered in native grasses. The football team played their games there until 1922, when Corbett Field opened at the southeast corner of campus. Over time, as the needs of the university have changed, the area has been altered and redesigned. The original design was established in 1924, and in 1949, the area was landscaped with blue spruce and mugo pine. In February 1965, the board of trustees decided to construct the new science center on the west side of Prexy&#x27;s Pasture. The board president, Harold F. Newton, who was concerned about the location, leaked the decision to the local press. The uproar that followed caused the board to decide on a new location for the science center and resulted in a new state statute making it necessary for any new structure built on the pasture to receive legislative approval. The statue known as &quot;University of Wyoming Family&quot; was installed in 1983 by UW professor Robert Russin in anticipation of the centennial celebration.

In the summer of 2004, Prexy&#x27;s Pasture was remodeled as the first step in a two-part redesign project. The first step involved removing the asphalt roadway that circled the pasture and replacing it with concrete walkways to make the area a walking campus, as recommended by the 1966 and 1991 campus master plans. The grassy area was also increased, and new lampposts were installed for better lighting. The second phase of the project involved the construction of a plaza at each corner, featuring trees and rocks styled after the rocky outcrops of nearby Vedauwoo. Two of the plazas, Simpson Plaza and Cheney Plaza, have been completed.

In 2015, several exhibits from the exhibition &quot;Sculpture: A Wyoming Invitational&quot; were featured along the exterior walkway. In addition to its primary use by students travelling to and from classes or socializing, the area is host to campus barbecues and fall welcome events.

===Wyoming Union===
In September 1937, the university obtained a Public Works Administration loan during the Great Depression for $149,250 for construction of a student union. On March 3, 1938, ground was broken and construction began on what would become the Wyoming Union. Many students were involved in the construction, and twenty-five students were trained to be stone-cutters.

From the beginning, the union housed an assortment of student needs and activities. The formal and informal social needs were met by including a ballroom, banquet room, lounges, and game rooms. It also contained offices for student government, committees, organizations, and publications, to help meet the political and organizational needs of the student population. Lastly, a student store, post office, and bookstore completed the design.

The original design has been modified several times to accommodate changing needs and a growing student population. The first addition was completed in January 1960. This section, added to the northeast of the original structure, expanded the ballroom, made a lounge area and senate chambers adjacent to the ballroom, created the main lobby and breezeway, and provided a larger food area called The Gardens. In 1973, an addition to the north was completed to make a food court, add more space for the bookstore, and create additional offices. Also, parts of the original building were remodeled to create the Campus Activities Center, an art gallery, and a ticket outlet. In 2000, the Wyoming Union underwent extensive renovation. The $12 million project moved the food court to the main level, expanded the bookstore to the lower level, and revitalized the look and feel of the interior.

===Ross Hall===
Ross Hall was built in 1959 and first used as a women&#x27;s dormitory. In 1975, Ross Hall was converted to academic offices. It is located on the south side of Prexy&#x27;s Pasture and is named after Nellie Tayloe Ross, Wyoming&#x27;s and the nation&#x27;s first woman governor, elected in 1924. There is a brass plaque relief of Nellie Ross in Ross Hall. She was married to William B. Ross, the 12th governor of Wyoming, who died in office. In 2000, on Ross Hall&#x27;s fourth floor, the university installed the &quot;Wyoming Press Association&#x27;s Newspaper Hall of Fame&quot; wall photos. In 2014, the Rendezvous Cafe open in the lobby.

===Half Acre Gym===
The Half Acre Gym facility was constructed in 1925 to house the National Guard Armory of Laramie, as well as the athletic programs, until the field house opened in 1951. In order to fund this project, the university received a $100,000 gift from the Wyoming State Legislature, designated to be used for new buildings, such as a library, the gymnasium and armory, a power plant, an engineering building, and an expansion of the Hoyt Hall dormitory. The original structure occupied half an acre (), hence the name &quot;Half Acre Gym&quot;. It was one of the largest facilities of its type at the time.

The building has undergone several renovations to increase its size and structural safety. In 2012, the university announced a $27 million renovation to begin in the Spring of 2013 and be completed by the Fall of 2014. Groathouse Construction, a local construction management firm, carried out the project in two phases to allow maximum use of the facility while it was under construction. Phase One would consist of the demolition and recreation of the east portion of the building. Phase Two would include the reopening of the east portion and the closure and construction of the west portion, which is the historical section of the building. Throughout the renovation, the university hoped to keep and incorporate as much of the historical structure and facade as possible.

The improvements included elevators, added classrooms, a space for athletic training, new racquetball courts, a climbing wall for Bouldering, a dance studio, a jogging/walking track, and new locker rooms with access to the pool.

===Coe Library===
The original library at the University of Wyoming consisted of 300 books and was located in Old Main. In 1923, the library was moved to the new Aven Nelson Memorial Building. With the 1950s came a larger student population and a greater push for America to excel academically. These factors contributed to the decision by the board of trustees that it was necessary to construct a new library. However, in 1951, the state legislature rejected the funding request.

William Robertson Coe, a financier and philanthropist, came to the aid of president Humphrey in 1954 by contributing $750,000 in securities to the university. The trustees called the grant &quot;one of the most outstanding contributions that has ever been made to the perpetuation of the American heritage&quot; and assured Coe that the building would be &quot;appropriately named&quot;. In 1955, the state legislature matched the Coe grant for an overall amount of $1.5 million.

Laramie architects Eliot and Clinton Hitchcock, whose father had designed the Aven Nelson Memorial Building, teamed up with the Porter and Porter firm in Cheyenne to design the new library. Their modular design was popular at the time and they intended to make the space very functional. The layout provided room for over 500,000 books and seating for at least 900 students. In May 1956, one year after the death of Coe, ground was broken and construction began on the building. The William Robertson Coe Library was finished in time for the Fall 1958 semester. In 1979, the stack tower was completed. This structure, designed by Kellogg and Kellogg of Cheyenne and Rock Springs, Wyoming, almost doubled the shelf space of the original Coe Library.

The most recent renovation of the library was completed in the fall of 2009 and officially dedicated on November 19, 2009. Hinthorne Mott Architects designed the new wing, referred to as Coe East, which added to the library. The addition was part of a larger, $50 million project to modernize the library by integrating technology and information. The renovation created an additional 20 group study rooms, space for 180 computer terminals, and features art by James Surls.

===Classroom Building===
The Classroom Building, dedicated in 1971 at a cost of $1.75 million, was designed to be a general purpose building for the university. The placement and unique design by the local architects W. Eliot and Clinton A. Hitchcock makes it the focal point of the George Duke Humphrey Science Center. The building also contains four interior mosaics, designed by University of Wyoming art professors James Boyle, Joseph Deaderick, Richard Evans, and Victor Flach, that represent the quadrant of Wyoming they face. Each mosaic is over 

In 2007, after a two-year, $14.7 million renovation project, the Classroom Building reopened. The goal of the renovation was to incorporate new technology and redesign the seating better to meet the needs of students who carry laptops and backpacks. The building was also retrofitted with air conditioning. The unique characteristics of the original building, such as the circular design and mosaics, were maintained.

=== Berry Biodiversity Conservation Center ===
The Berry Biodiversity Conservation Center was added to the University of Wyoming campus in January 2012. This building, which focuses on the study of biodiversity, is dedicated to Robert and Carol Berry, who gifted it to the University. The cost of the building was $15 million. It has three floors and 40,000 square feet with labs and an auditorium. The Berry Center is home to both the vertebrate museum and the Wyoming Natural Diversity Database (WNDD). There is also an ecology lab, a stable isotope facility, and a program in ecology. The building also faculty offices, a teaching lab, display areas, public meeting areas, and a garden on the roof.

===Housing===
The university has four residence halls and four apartment complexes. The four residence halls, Orr, White (the second tallest building in Wyoming), Downey, and McIntyre, are connected together via the Washakie Dining Center, which contains the main dining hall and other student services. These residence halls house primarily freshmen. All incoming freshmen are expected to live in the residence halls during their first year, with some exceptions.

Each of the residence halls is named after an influential administrator or faculty member. Downey Hall is an eight-story dormitory located southwest of the Washakie Dining Center and is named after June Downey. Located west of the Washakie Dining Center is White Hall, a dormitory named after Laura Amanda White. At twelve stories and 146 feet, White Hall is the second tallest building in the state of Wyoming, two feet shorter than the Wyoming Financial Center in Cheyenne. McIntyre Hall, named after Clara Frances McIntyre, is located east of the Washakie Dining Center. This twelve-story building underwent extensive renovations in 2004 and 2005. Just northeast of McIntyre Hall is the eight-story Orr Hall, named after Harriet Knight Orr. From 2005 to 2006, Orr Hall also underwent extensive renovations to modernize its living space.

The University Apartments are located east of War Memorial Stadium. They are available on a first-come, first-serve basis to all University of Wyoming students above freshman standing. There are apartment units in a variety of layouts in the River Village, Bison Run, Landmark, and Spanish Walk apartment complexes.

Two new residence halls, North and South Halls, and dining center are under construction east of Half Acre Gymnasium. Construction is expected to be completed in 2026. This is the former location of Wyoming Hall and a pay by the hour parking lot.

In collaboration with the College of Law, the museum conducts research and instruction on the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and legal issues surrounding the repatriation of human remains.

====University of Wyoming Geological Museum====
The University of Wyoming&#x27;s Geological Museum houses a collection of fossils and minerals with special focus on the history of Wyoming. When the University of Wyoming was founded, the museum was essentially the small personal collection of Professor J.D. Conley. In 1893, Wilbur Knight, who was hired as a professor of mining and geology, took over as the museum curator. The museum moved to the Hall of Science in 1902 and continued to expand. By the time the collection was moved to its current location in 1956, Knight&#x27;s son Samuel Howell Knight had made the university&#x27;s Geology Department well known around the country. Samuel Howell Knight acquired many of the exhibits and paintings that are still on display, including the copper Tyrannosaurus at the entrance, the initial mounting of the Apatosaurus skeleton centerpiece, and the terracotta Stegosaurus and Triceratops panels.

One of the most famous exhibits at the museum is the Allosaurus known as &quot;Big Al&quot;. It was featured in the BBC documentary &quot;The Ballad of Big Al.&quot; The University of Wyoming Geological Museum has also received coverage from &quot;National Geographic&quot;, CNN, &quot;Earth Magazine&quot;, Walter Cronkite, and &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; with Tom Brokaw, and it has been shown on many dinosaur programs. On June 30, 2009, the museum was closed to meet state budget cuts. Following this controversial decision, an endowment fund was set up to support the museum. After substantial infrastructure upgrades, the museum reopened to the public on January 12, 2013 and resumed its regular hours with free admission. Some exhibits, like the Late Cretaceous display, have been completed, while others are still under renovation.

====University of Wyoming Anthropology Museum====
The University of Wyoming Anthropology Museum is operated by the Anthropology Department and is located in the Anthropology Building at 12th and Lewis Streets. Exhibits are spread throughout three floors of the building. Displays include early humans, the Colby Mammoth Site, Vore Buffalo Jump, and other Wyoming archaeology sites.
====University of Wyoming Insect Museum====

<text>Amparo Ramos Correa (December 30, 1944 – March 15, 2004) was a popular Colombian dancer famous as a celebrity in the &quot;Feria de Cali&quot; and as a dancer for several popular Latin musicians. She was nicknamed &quot;Amparo Arrebato&quot; (Arrebato is Spanish for &quot;rapture&quot; or &quot;fury&quot;) for her strong and furious way of dancing capable of rousing strong sentiments both in dancers and spectators.

Amparo was born in Cali, Colombia. As a student. she excelled in high-speed athletics and basketball. Later she became the most popular dancer of the annual &quot;Santiago de Cali Fair&quot;.

Her prominence as dancer began in the 1960s, thanks to recognition of Dámaso Pérez Prado, &quot;The King of Mambo&quot;, who invited her to join to his dance group.

Afterwards, the Puerto Rican salsa duo Richie Ray &amp; Bobby Cruz increased her fame when they released their 1970 album Agúzate containing the well-known tune &quot;Amparo Arrebato&quot;, composed in honor of the then 23-year-old dancer.

Amparo died of a heart attack at a hospital in Cali at the age of 59.

<text>Hermanis Matisons (; 1894, Riga – 1932) was a Latvian chess player and one of world&#x27;s most highly regarded chess masters in the early 1930s. He was also a leading composer of endgame studies. He died of tuberculosis at the age of 38.

In 1924, Matisons won the first Latvian Chess Championship tournament. Later that year he finished ahead of Fricis Apšenieks, and Edgard Colle to win the first World Amateur Championship, which was organized in conjunction with the Paris Olympic Games, followed by Max Euwe in 1928. Matisons played first board for Latvia at the 1931 Chess Olympiad in Prague and defeated Akiba Rubinstein and Alexander Alekhine, then the reigning World Champion.

Sixty of Matisons&#x27; endgame studies were collected in the 1987 book &quot;Mattison&#x27;s Chess Endgame Studies&quot; by T.G. Whitworth.

<doc id="535725" wikidata="Q305050" url="?curid=535725" title="Dominant wavelength">
<text>In color science, the dominant wavelength is a method of approximating a color&#x27;s hue. Along with purity, it makes up one half of the Helmholtz coordinates. A color&#x27;s dominant wavelength is the wavelength of monochromatic spectral light that, if plotted in a chromaticity diagram, the straight line that passes through the color in question and the white point will also pass through this wavelength.

==Determination==
===Helmholtz coordinates===

The Helmholtz coordinates are a polar coordinate system for defining a 2D chromaticity plane. The circumferential coordinate is the dominant wavelength, which is analogous to hue of the HSV color space. The radial coordinate is the purity, which is analogous to saturation of the HSV color space.

===Color space===
Not all color spaces can be used for determining the dominant wavelength of a color, because in most approximately perceptually uniform color spaces (such as CIELAB, Oklab, CIECAM02, etc) two colors with the same hue can have slightly different dominant wavelengths. Unless otherwise stated, the CIE 1931 color space (CIEXYZ) is used., but the CIELUV color space is sometimes used. The LMS color space can also be used for this purpose.

===Calculation===
To calculate the dominant wavelength of a chromaticity (or color), a half straight line is drawn on the chromaticity diagram that passes through the chromaticity&#x27;s coordinates and starts in the white point (almost always, illuminant E, which is the equal energy white point). The line is then extrapolated so it intersects the perimeter of the diagram at one point, where the perimeter comprises the spectral locus or the line of purples. The point of intersection of that line and the spectral locus is the dominant wavelength. If the line intersects with the line of purples and not the spectral locus, the complementary wavelength is used. The purity can then be calculated as defined here.

===White point===
The white point is generally defined as—or assumed to be—equal energy white (illuminant E). This is defined as [x, y] = (1/3, 1/3) in CIE xyY, and as [X, Y, Z] = (1, 1, 1) in XYZ color space. However, other white points may be used, generally defined by &quot;white&quot; standard illuminants or a color temperature such as 6500K (D65).

===Complementary wavelength===
When the chromaticity lies within the triangle with vertices at the white point, extreme spectral violet (360 nm), and extreme spectral red (780 nm), the dominant wavelength is indeterminate because the half straight line that passes through the white point and that chromaticity point intersects the limit of the visible gamut in the line of purples instead of the spectral locus. The colors on the line of purples cannot be defined by wavelength because they do not represent monochromatic light.

Instead, the dominant wavelength is replaced with the &quot;complementary wavelength&quot;, which will represent the complementary color. To calculate it, the half straight line that starts on that chromaticity and passes through the white point is used; the intersection between this line and the spectral locus is the complementary wavelength. If a color doesn&#x27;t have a dominant wavelength (and it is not achromatic), its complementary color will.

==Application==
Dominant wavelength is used to define the color of light sources, such as the LEDs, that do not lie along the Planckian locus (which would otherwise be defined by color temperature). These light sources are also often described by their &quot;peak wavelength&quot;—the wavelength of highest radiometric spectral flux (highest peak in the power spectrum)—but the dominant wavelength is a photometric quantity, and therefore intuitively conveys what color the light will appear without relying on inexact color naming.

<text>Sidney Earle Smith (9 March 1897 – 17 March 1959) was an academic and Canada&#x27;s Secretary of State for External Affairs in the government of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker.

==Early life and education==
Born and raised on Nova Scotia&#x27;s Port Hood Island, Smith grew up speaking both English and Gaelic. He received a B.A. and an M.A. from the University of King&#x27;s College, followed by an LL.B. from Dalhousie University.

==Career==
Smith became a lawyer and a professor of law, lecturing at Osgoode Hall Law School and then at Dalhousie University. In 1929, he became dean of Dalhousie&#x27;s law school. In 1934, he left the Maritimes to become president of the University of Manitoba. In 1945, he was appointed the president of the University of Toronto. He remained in that role for twelve years, overseeing a major period of the university&#x27;s expansion.

==Politics==
A strong Conservative in the Red Tory tradition, Smith became a prominent member of the Progressive Conservative Party. In 1956, he was considered a possibility for the party&#x27;s leadership, but decided not to run, disappointing those in the party establishment who wished to prevent the populist John Diefenbaker from becoming leader.

After Diefenbaker won a surprise minority government in 1957, Smith was appointed as Secretary of State for External Affairs. Despite Smith&#x27;s brilliance and popularity in academia, his success in this new role was limited. After holding the position for two years, he died suddenly of a stroke in 1959.

==Posthumous recognition==
Sidney Smith Hall, the central building of the Faculty of Arts and Science at the University of Toronto, is named after him.

<text>, abbreviated as Nismo, is a division of Nissan Motorsports &amp; Customizing focused in motorsport and performance-oriented car models for Nissan. Nismo was initially a company, , formed in 1984 as a result of a merger of two motorsport departments, being the in-house tuning, motorsports and performance subsidiary of Nissan. It has competed in JSPC, JTCC, the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the 24 Hours of Daytona. , they participate in Super GT in Japan and in Formula E internationally. Nismo ceased to be a company in April 2022 by being merged with sister company Autech into a new Nissan subsidiary, Nissan Motorsport &amp; Customizing.

==History==
The Nismo story began in 1964 when a local company called Prince Motor Company realized that they could boost their sales by going into the competitive motorsport business. Nismo&#x27;s first competitive motor sport debut was on 1 May 1964 − in their first race they ended up coming just short however it was bitter sweet as the Skyline took all positions from 2nd to 6th.

In 1984, Nissan decided that it wanted to merge its two motorsport divisions, founded through the 1960s, they were (known as Publication Division 3), based in its Oppama factory, responsible for the needs of privateer teams and (Special Car Testing Division), within its Ōmori plant, responsible for its factory operations. The company&#x27;s intention following the merger was to specialize in sportscar racing, but it also provided support for teams competing in the domestic F3 series.

In 1988 the first dedicated race car by Nissan debuted, and saw incredible performance in circuit races. This vehicle was the iconic Nissan Skyline R32, sporting the GT-R badge.

In 1988, Nismo built its first car, the Saurus for motorsport use for its one-make series. The following year they developed the Skyline GT-R for racing as well as building the 500 evolution editions for road use. The R34, the R32&#x27;s generational grandchild was the first car to be produced with a V-Spec.

In December 2021, Nissan said it would merge Nismo and sister company Autech (a tuning and conversion operation) into a new company called &quot;Nissan Motorsports &amp; Customizing Co., Ltd.&quot;. The merge was completed on April 1, 2022.

== Products ==
Products include the GT-R, 370Z, Sentra, Frontier, and the Juke Nismo. Soon to be added to the range is the hatchback Nissan Pulsar Nismo and the electric Nissan Leaf

=== Tuning kits ===

Nismo designs and manufactures a range of aftermarket performance parts for Nissan cars including aerodynamics parts such as spoilers and diffusers, alloy wheels, engine and suspension parts. The 2017 Infiniti Q60, being much criticized for its mild exhaust sound, about six months after its introduction had a specially tuned Nismo muffler made available through Infiniti dealers as an aftermarket item.

Most Datsun, Nissan, and Infiniti branded cars have performance parts available from Nismo, either in production or as old stock. For example, Nismo sells parts such as unground cam billets, performance cams, pistons, etc. for the KA24E engine, which was used in the Nissan small pickup truck for several years and also used for the 1989 and 1990 model years of 240SX, a popular car among Import scene enthusiasts (especially Drifters) in North America.

In Japan, the V35 Skyline and Z33 Fairlady have both received several levels of Nismo tuning packages (E-Type, S-Tune, R-Tune, and S1 packages), with a full track spec Fairlady Z debuted at the 2005 Nismo Festival of Speed held at (formerly) Fuji International Raceway.

In February 2007, Nismo announced the launch of the Nismo 380RS. The Nismo 380RS is a factory modified version of the Nissan Z33 Fairlady Z tuned by both Nismo and Autech. Two versions were released, the first was a track-only model called the 380RS-C (C for competition), the second is a street model being sold at Nissan dealers. Both versions use a Nissan VQ series V6 engine, bored and stroked to 3.8L. The track-only 380RS-C makes , and the street version makes approximately . The Nismo 380RS was only sold in Japan.

=== Production cars ===
The first Nismo-branded car was the 1987 Skyline R31 GTS-R Group A evolution special limited to 823 examples. This was followed by the 1990 Skyline GT-R Nismo of which only 560 were produced. Both cars featured weight-saving, aerodynamic, performance and reliability improvements necessary for the rigours of Group A competition.

The next Nismo release was the Skyline GT-R R34 &#x27;Z-Tune&#x27;. Intended to celebrate the 2005 20th anniversary of Nismo, the 2003 cancellation of R34 production meant that Nismo was only able to create 20 cars, all based on second-hand V.spec units purchased back from customers with less than 30,000 km on the odometer. The Z Tune sold for (, as of December 7, 2005) in Japan. However, the parts-conversion version, where the customer&#x27;s Skyline GT-R&#x27;s become the base car, sells for (, as of December 7, 2005). Due to rarity the GT-R Z-tune can exceed in the car market. The engine is an RB28DETT Z2 (a normal GT-R engine with a stroked displacement of 2.8 liters &amp; Nismo parts designed specifically for the Z2). The car weighs .

Nismo was also responsible for the R33 Skyline 400R and S14 Silvia 270R models. Both featured comprehensive modifications to the drivetrain, suspension, brakes, chassis, and aero work. Very limited numbers of both models were sold in 1997, and both command high resale prices even today. These models stressed Nismo&#x27;s link to street car tuning, and were developed (as was the Z-Tune GT-R) at their Chiba City tuning garage. Nismo street tuned vehicles have been sold at Nissan dealerships for years, and come with full warranties. Nismo also produced 21 versions of the Pulsar GTi-R, essentially these cars contained all of the NISMO Group N parts available at the time in a fully built car.

==== List of Nismo-branded consumer vehicles ====
==Japanese Grand Prix==
In the 1960s, Nissan competed in the Japanese Grand Prix sports car race.

==IMSA GT Championship==

Nissan joined the IMSA GT Championship in 1979, where it competed in the GT classes with the 240SX, 280ZX and 300ZX. From 1985 to 1993, they entered the main GTP class with the GTP ZX-Turbo and NPT-90. Geoff Brabham won four GTP drivers championships with Nissan from 1988 to 1991, and the manufacturer won the 1992 24 Hours of Daytona and the 1989, 1990 and 1991 12 Hours of Sebring.
==World Sports Prototype Championship==


In the 1980s and 1990s, Nissan raced at the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship and 24 Hours of Le Mans with sports prototypes such as the R88C, R89C, R90C and R391. They claimed the 1990, 1991 and 1992 JSPC titles, but they never won at Le Mans. Notable Nissan drivers in this era include Masahiro Hasemi, Kazuyoshi Hoshino, Masahiko Kageyama and Toshio Suzuki.
== Touring Car Racing ==

In the 1980s, the manufacturer entered the Fuji Grand Champion Series with Group 5 Bluebird, Skyline and Silvia silhouettes and the Japanese Touring Car Championship with production Skyline models. In the 1990s, Nissan competed in Supertouring championships around the world with the Nissan Primera, winning the 1999 British Touring Car Championship with Laurent Aïello.

== Supercars Championship ==
From 2013 onwards Nissan competed in the Supercars Championship with Kelly Racing fielding four Nissan Altimas. The factory backing concluded at the end of 2018, although the Altimas continued to be privately entered in 2019.

==International GT Racing==


In 2009, Nissan entered the FIA GT1 World Championship with a Nismo-developed Nissan GT-R. Krumm and Lucas Luhr were 2011 drivers champions. Since 2011, Nismo has produced the GT-R GT3, which has competed in the Blancpain Endurance Series. Nismo has also developed production class Nissan GT-R cars for the 24 Hours of Nürburgring.

They also have a pool of drivers, known as the Nismo Global Driver Exchange. This allows factory drivers the chance to race in big events such as the Le Mans 24 Hours, the 24 Hours of Dubai and the Bathurst 12 Hour.

== Prototype racing ==

Nissan&#x27;s first LMP1 Hybrid which was unsuccessful and caused Nissan and Nismo to withdraw Le Mans entirely.

From 2011 to 2016, Nissan was involved in the FIA World Endurance Championship and European Le Mans Series as a LMP2 engine supplier. They have had success with Greaves Motorsport, Signature Team, OAK Racing, TDS Racing, G-Drive Racing and SMP Racing. In 2017, Nissan entered the DPi class of the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with Extreme Speed Motorsports.

Nissan announced in June 2014, that Nismo will enter the LMP1 category to fight for the FIA World Endurance Championship against Audi, Toyota and Porsche. Following a disappointing performance in the 2015 24 Hours of Le Mans, the program&#x27;s remaining schedule in 2015 was pushed back, with the team intending a regular rebut in the 2016 season; however on 22 December 2015, Nissan announced that it was shuttering the program altogether.

== Formula E ==
In the inaugural season of Formula E, DAMS (as e.dams) partnered with sister company Renault to form Team e.dams Renault, where they became the first Formula E Team&#x27;s Champion. At the end of the 2017-18 season, Renault decided to focus on Formula One with Nissan taking over Renault&#x27;s place in the partnership with e.dams to form Nissan e.dams for the 2018-19 season. In April 2022, Nissan announced the acquisition of the e.dams race team and entered the 2022-23 season as Nissan Formula E Team. , it is the only international racing series where Nissan and Nismo are competing.

<text>Ohio is a state located in the Midwestern United States. Cities in Ohio are municipalities whose population is no less than 5,000; smaller municipalities are called villages. Nonresident college students and incarcerated inmates do not count towards the city requirement of 5,000 residents. There are currently 253 cities and 673 villages in Ohio, for a total of 926 municipalities.

Municipality names are not unique: there is a village of Centerville in Gallia County and a city of Centerville in Montgomery County; there is also a city of Oakwood in Montgomery County as well as the villages of Oakwood in Cuyahoga County and Oakwood in Paulding County. Bay Village and The Village of Indian Hill are cities despite the word &quot;Village&quot; in their names, and 16 villages have &quot;City&quot; in their names.

The most populous city in Ohio is Columbus with 905,748 residents.

<doc id="535759" wikidata="Q3284731" url="?curid=535759" title="Curse of the Billy Goat">
<text>The Curse of the Billy Goat was a sports curse that was supposedly placed on the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise in 1945, by Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis. The curse lasted 71 years, from 1945 to 2016. During Game 4 of the 1945 World Series at Wrigley Field, Sianis&#x27;s pet goat, named Murphy, was bothering other fans, and so the pair were asked to leave the stadium. Outraged, Sianis allegedly declared, &quot;Them Cubs, they ain&#x27;t gonna win no more&quot;, which had been interpreted to mean that the Cubs would never win another National League (NL) pennant, at least for the remainder of Sianis&#x27;s life.

The Cubs lost the 1945 World Series to the Detroit Tigers, and did not win a pennant or World Series championship again until 2016. The Cubs had last won the World Series in 1908. After the incident with Sianis and Murphy, the Cubs did not play in the World Series for the next 71 years until, on the 46th anniversary of William Sianis&#x27;s death, the &quot;curse&quot; was broken when they defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5–0 in Game 6 of the 2016 National League Championship Series to win the NL pennant. The Cubs then defeated the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians 8–7 in 10 innings in Game 7 to win the World Series, 108 years after their last win.

==Origins of the curse==
The exact nature of Sianis&#x27;s curse differs in various accounts of the incident. Some state that he declared that no World Series games would ever again be played at Wrigley Field, while others believe that his ban was on the Cubs appearing in the World Series, making no mention of a specific venue. Sianis&#x27;s family claims that he dispatched a telegram to team owner Philip K. Wrigley that read, “You are going to lose this World Series and you are never going to win another World Series again. You are never going to win a World Series again because you insulted my goat.”

Whatever the truth, the Cubs were up two games to one in the 1945 World Series, but ended up losing Game 4, as well as the best-of-seven series, four games to three. The curse was immortalized in newspaper columns over the years, particularly by syndicated columnist Mike Royko. The curse gained widespread attention during the 2003 postseason, when Fox television commentators played it up during the Cubs-Marlins matchup in the National League Championship Series (NLCS). According to an account in the &quot;Chicago Sun&quot; of October 7, 1945, the goat was turned away at the gate, and Sianis left the goat tied to a stake in a parking lot and went into the game alone. There was mention of a lawsuit, but no mention of a curse.

Between their 1908 triumph, which was the Cubs&#x27; second world championship (they&#x27;d also won the Series in 1907 to become baseball&#x27;s first back-to-back winners as well as the first franchise to appear in three consecutive World Series), and 1945, the first year of the alleged Billy Goat Curse, the Cubs won the National League pennant six times but failed to win the Series: in 1910, in 1918 (won by the Boston Red Sox who themselves would soon become victims of an alleged baseball curse and not win another Series for 86 years), in 1929, in 1932 (known for Babe Ruth&#x27;s called shot at Wrigley Field), in 1935 (a rematch of the 1908 series against the Detroit Tigers, with the Tigers winning this time, their first Series triumph in five appearances dating back to the early 1900s), and in 1938.

==Alleged curse incidents==
In the years that followed the alleged curse, the following incidents have been attributed to it:
* On September 9, 1969, at Shea Stadium, the Cubs played the New York Mets in a critical pennant race game. A stray black cat walked between Cubs captain Ron Santo, who was on deck, and the Cubs dugout. The Mets pulled ahead of the Cubs in the series and eventually won both the newly formed NL East and the 1969 World Series.
* In 1984, the Cubs’ first postseason appearance since 1945 was dashed by the San Diego Padres in the National League Championship Series. The Cubs were victorious in the first two games of the best-of-five series. However, in Game Five, first baseman Leon Durham let a ground ball get past his allegedly wet glove in the bottom of the seventh inning. The Padres went on to score four runs to win the game and the series.
* Bill Buckner played for the Chicago Cubs for seven seasons before being traded to the Boston Red Sox halfway through the 1984 season. The Red Sox were at the time also considered a cursed franchise, and had not won a World Series since 1918 – when, coincidentally, they had beaten the Cubs. Buckner and the Red Sox advanced to the 1986 World Series against the New York Mets, and took a 3–2 series lead coming into Game 6. On October 25, 1986, in one of the most famous baseball errors of all time, Buckner allowed a ball to pass between his legs at first base, allowing the Mets to score the winning run in the 10th inning and win Game 6. Later analysis of a photograph of Buckner walking off the field after his blooper showed that he had been wearing a Cubs batting glove under his glove at the moment he committed his error.
* In 1989, the Cubs won 93 games and faced the San Francisco Giants in the NLCS, now a best-of-seven series. After splitting the first two games at home, the Cubs headed to the Bay Area, where despite holding a lead at some point in each of the next three games, bullpen meltdowns and managerial blunders ultimately led to three straight losses.
* In 1998, behind NL MVP Sammy Sosa, the Cubs won the Wild Card after winning a tiebreaker game versus the Giants. However, they were swept in the National League Division Series by the Atlanta Braves.
* In 2001, the Cubs led the wild card race by 2.5 games in early September, but a three-run walk-off homer by Preston Wilson halted the team&#x27;s momentum. The team ended up finishing 88–74, five games behind both the Houston Astros and St. Louis Cardinals, who tied for first.
* In 2003, the Cubs won the NL Central and beat the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS for their first postseason win since 1908. Advancing to the NLCS to face the Florida Marlins, the Cubs held a three games to two lead in the best of seven series heading into Game 6. In the eighth inning of Game 6, with Chicago ahead 3–0, several spectators attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of Marlins second baseman Luis Castillo. One of the fans, Steve Bartman, reached for the ball, deflecting it and disrupting a potential catch by Cubs outfielder Moisés Alou. If Alou had caught the ball, it would have been the second out in the inning and the Cubs would have been just four outs away from winning their first National League pennant since 1945. Instead, the Cubs ended up surrendering eight runs in the inning and losing the game, 8–3. When they were eliminated in the seventh game the next night, the incident was seen as the &quot;first domino&quot; in the turning point of the series.
* In 2004, the Cubs were picked by many media outlets as a favorite to win the World Series. However, the team struggled with injuries and inconsistent play for most of the year. Nevertheless, by late September, the Cubs were leading the Wild Card race by 1.5 games over the San Francisco Giants and the Houston Astros, but in their game on September 25, they collapsed in extra innings and they proceeded to drop six of the last eight games as the Astros won the Wild Card.
* The Cubs won their division in both 2007 and 2008, but were swept in the NLDS both years by the Arizona Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers respectively. Between the 1984 NLCS, the 1989 NLCS, the 2007 NLDS, the 2008 NLDS, the Cubs did not win a postseason game on the road in a West Coast city. 
* In 2015, the Cubs finished second in the National League Wild Card race and defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the Wild Card Game and the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLDS to advance to the NLCS against the New York Mets. However, the Cubs posted an NLCS record low .164 batting average and lost the series in a four-game sweep without ever leading at any point. Sianis&#x27;s goat was named Murphy. This was referenced by fans of the New York Mets, who joked that Daniel Murphy, the Mets second baseman and series MVP, was &quot;not the first GOAT (Greatest of All Time, in reference to Murphy&#x27;s postseason heroics to that point) named Murphy to keep the Cubs out of the World Series&quot;.

==Attempts to break the curse==
Before his death on October 22, 1970, William Sianis himself attempted to lift the curse. Sam Sianis, his nephew, has gone to Wrigley Field with a goat multiple times in attempts to break the curse, including on Opening Day in 1984 and again in 1989, both years in which the Cubs went on to win their division. In 1994, Sam Sianis went again, with a goat, to stop a home losing streak, and in 1998 for the Wild Card tie-breaker game, which the Cubs won.

In 2003 (the Chinese zodiac&#x27;s Year of the Goat), a group of Cubs fans headed to Houston with a billy goat named &quot;Virgil Homer&quot; and attempted to gain entrance to Minute Maid Park, home of the Astros, division rivals of the Cubs at the time. After they were denied entrance, they unfurled a scroll, read a verse and proclaimed they were &quot;reversing the curse&quot;. The Cubs won the division that year and then came within five outs of playing in the World Series, but were undone by the Florida Marlins&#x27; eight-run rally immediately following the Steve Bartman incident. The Cubs then lost the following game and with it the series. (The Marlins went on to win the World Series against the New York Yankees.) Further salting the wound, the Astros earned their first World Series berth two years later and their crosstown rival the Chicago White Sox won the series.

On February 26, 2004, at the Harry Caray Restaurant in downtown Chicago, the Bartman baseball was electrocuted in an attempt to break the curse, leaving nothing but a heap of string behind.

In another bizarre twist, it was reported that a butchered goat was hung from the Harry Caray statue on October 3, 2007, to which &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; noted: &quot;If the prankster intended to reverse the supposed billy goat curse with the stunt, it doesn&#x27;t appear to have worked.&quot; While the Cubs did win the NL Central division title in 2007 and 2008, they were swept in the first round of the postseason in both years: by the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2007 and the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2008. The elimination by Arizona came on October 6, the same date that the goat appeared at Wrigley Field in 1945. The act was repeated before the home opener in 2009; this time a goat&#x27;s butchered head was hung from the statue. The act was futile as the Cubs were eliminated from postseason contention on September 26, 2009.

In 2008, a Greek Orthodox priest sought to end the curse during the 2008 playoffs with a spraying of holy water in and around the Cubs dugout to no avail.

On April 1, 2011, a social enterprise called Reverse The Curse, dedicated to bringing innovations to poverty by giving goats to families in developing countries, was initiated. The goats provide the families with milk, cheese, and alternative income to help lift them out of poverty. Reverse The Curse has expanded into reversing the &quot;curses&quot; that afflict the world&#x27;s children in education and obesity.

On February 25, 2012, a group of five Chicago Cubs fans calling themselves &quot;Crack the Curse&quot; set out on foot from Mesa, Arizona (home to the Cubs&#x27; spring training facilities) to Wrigley Field. They brought along a goat named Wrigley who they believed would be able to break the Curse of the Billy Goat upon arrival at Wrigley Field. Additionally, they attempted to raise $100,000 for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

On April 10, 2013, a severed goat&#x27;s head was delivered to the Cubs in a possible effort to lift the curse on the team. It was addressed to Cubs owner Thomas S. Ricketts.

On September 22, 2015, Patrick Bertoletti, Tim Brown, Takeru Kobayashi, Kevin Strahle and Bob Shoudt consumed a 40-pound goat in 13 minutes and 22 seconds at Taco in a Bag restaurant in Chicago.

==Former Cubs who won a World Series title elsewhere==
Another factor that may have played a role in the curse was the number of players (44 of them are listed below) who won World Series titles after leaving the Cubs. (This is known as the Ex-Cubs Factor). These players include Andy Pafko (who, coincidentally, played in the 1945 World Series as a member of the Cubs), Gene Baker, Smoky Burgess, Don Hoak, Dale Long, Lou Brock (whose first title was in after a mid-season trade to the St. Louis Cardinals), Barney Schultz, Lou Johnson, Jim Brewer, Moe Drabowsky, Don Cardwell, Ken Holtzman, Billy North, Fred Norman, Bill Madlock, Manny Trillo, Greg Gross, Rick Monday, Burt Hooton, Bruce Sutter, Willie Hernández, Milt Wilcox, Joe Niekro, Dennis Eckersley (he made three consecutive World Series with Oakland, winning the middle bid in 1989), Billy Hatcher, Joe Carter, Greg Maddux, Dwight Smith, Joe Girardi (as both a player and a manager), José Vizcaíno, Glenallen Hill (after his second stint with the Cubs; his title came in after a mid-season trade), Luis Gonzalez (who hit the walk-off bloop single that won Arizona the World Series in 2001), Mike Morgan, Mark Grace, Mark Bellhorn, Bill Mueller (drove in speedy pinch runner Dave Roberts to spark Boston&#x27;s epic comeback in the 2004 ALCS), Scott Eyre (whose title came in after he had been traded from the Cubs during the season), Tom Gordon, Matt Stairs, Jamie Moyer, Jerry Hairston Jr., Mark DeRosa, Mike Fontenot, Ryan Theriot, Ángel Pagán, and, in 2013, Ryan Dempster. Dontrelle Willis and Jon Garland were traded as minor leaguers (coincidentally, Willis won a World Series ring with the Marlins team that defeated the Cubs in the 2003 NLCS). Tim Lincecum, who went on to win three World Series titles, was originally drafted by the Cubs, but he did not sign with them.

==End of the curse==
The Cubs ended the 2016 season with a () record. It was their first 100-win season since 1935 (, ), their best since 1910 (, ), and the sixth 100-win season in franchise history.

The Cubs won the National League Championship Series (NLCS), their first pennant in 71 years, with a 5–0 shutout in Game 6 against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Wrigley Field on October 22, 2016; the &quot;curse&quot; was broken on the 46th anniversary of Billy Sianis&#x27;s death.

The Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 World Series in seven games after trailing in the series 3 games to 1. They won Game 7 by a score of 8–7 in 10 innings at Progressive Field in Cleveland, Ohio, ending their 108-year drought.

== In popular culture ==
The 1989 film &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; depicts the Cubs defeating the Miami Gators, a fictional baseball team, in the 2015 World Series, which ended the longest drought in all four of the North American professional sports leagues. In reality, however, the Cubs were eliminated from the playoffs by the Mets on October 21, 2015. When the Cubs won the World Series the following year, the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; Twitter account tweeted that the prediction was one year off due to the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike.
