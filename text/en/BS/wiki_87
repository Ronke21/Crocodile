<text>The 1945 World Series was the championship series in Major League Baseball for the 1945 season. The 42nd edition of the World Series, it matched the American League champion Detroit Tigers against the National League champion Chicago Cubs. The Tigers won the Series in seven games, giving them their second championship and first since .

In the decisive Game 7, Paul Richards drove in four runs to lead the Tigers to a 9–3 victory to clinch the Series.

The World Series again used the 3–4 wartime setup for home field sites, instead of the normal 2–3–2. Although the major hostilities of World War II had ended, some of the rules were still in effect and many of the best MLB players were still in military service. Warren Brown, author of a history of the Cubs in 1946, commented on this by titling one chapter &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Series&quot;. He also cited a famous quote of his, referencing himself anonymously and in the third person. When asked who he liked in the Series, he answered, &quot;I don&#x27;t think either one of them can win it.&quot;

In a similar vein, Frank Graham jokingly called this Series &quot;the fat men versus the tall men at the office picnic.&quot;

One player decidedly not fitting that description was the Tigers&#x27; slugger Hank Greenberg, who had been discharged from military service early. He hit the only two Tigers homers in the Series, and scored seven runs overall and also drove in seven. The series matched the league MVPs, with Phil Cavarretta (a .355 hitter that year) of the National League and Hal Newhouser of the American League for the second straight season for Detroit. Newhouser led the Tigers to two victories, including a complete game performance in Game 7.

The Curse of the Billy Goat originated in this Series before the start of Game 4. Having last won the Series in , the Cubs owned the dubious record of both the longest league pennant drought and the longest World Series drought in history, not winning (or appearing in) another World Series until .

The Series was a rematch of the 1935 World Series. In that year&#x27;s Game 6, Stan Hack led off the top of the ninth inning with a triple, but was stranded. The Cubs lost the game and the Series. Hack was still with the Cubs in 1945. According to Warren Brown&#x27;s account, Hack was seen surveying the field before the first Series game. When asked what he was doing, Hack responded, &quot;I just wanted to see if I was &quot;still&quot; standing there on third base.&quot;

To date, the Chicago Cubs have had no personnel from this team elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

The visiting Cubs began with a bang, scoring four times in the first. With two outs and runners on first and third, a passed ball by future Hall of Famer Hal Newhouser scored the game&#x27;s first run. After an intentional walk, a two-run Bill Nicholson double and Mickey Livingston&#x27;s RBI single made it 4–0 Cubs. In the third, after a leadoff double, Phil Cavarretta&#x27;s single and Andy Pafko&#x27;s double scored a run each. One out later, Livingston&#x27;s second RBI single of the game knocked Newhouser out of the game. Cavarretta&#x27;s two-out home run in the seventh off Jim Tobin made it 8–0. Pafko then singled, stole second, moved to third on a passed ball, and scored the game&#x27;s last run on Nicholson&#x27;s single. Hank Borowy pitched a complete-game shutout despite allowing 12 base runners as the Cubs took a 1–0 series lead.

===Game 2===

The Cubs struck first when Phil Cavarretta doubled with one out in the fourth and scored on Bill Nicholson&#x27;s single. After 13 innings without a run, Detroit finally got going in a big way in the fifth. Hank Wyse got two outs, before allowing a single and walk. Doc Cramer&#x27;s RBI single tied the game before Hank Greenberg&#x27;s three-run home run put the Tigers up 4–1. Virgil Trucks allowed no other runs in a complete game as the Tigers tied the series at a game apiece.

===Game 3===
Claude Passeau pitched a complete game one-hitter. The only hit of the game came with two outs in the second inning off the bat of Rudy York. Other Series pitchers in the &quot;low-hit Complete Game Club&quot; are:
The Cubs scored two runs in the fourth off Stubby Overmire on RBI singles by Bill Nicholson and Roy Hughes after a leadoff double and one-out walk. They added another run in the seventh off Al Benton when Mickey Livingston hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Claude Passeau&#x27;s sacrifice fly. They now led the series 2–1.

===Game 4===

The Series shifted to Wrigley Field and the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat began. Dizzy Trout went the distance for Detroit with a five-hitter. A four-run fourth against Cub starter Ray Prim gave Trout all the runs he needed. After a one-out walk and single, Hank Greenberg&#x27;s RBI single and Roy Cullenbine&#x27;s RBI double knocked starter Ray Prim out of the game. Paul Derringer intentionally walked Rudy York before Jimmy Outlaw&#x27;s groundout and Paul Richards&#x27;s single scored a run each. The Cubs scored their only run of the game in the sixth when Don Johnson hit a leadoff triple and scored on Peanuts Lowrey&#x27;s groundout. The series was now tied 2–2.

===Game 5===

Back in form, Hal Newhouser went the distance for Detroit, striking out nine. The Tigers struck first in the top of the third on Doc Cramer&#x27;s sacrifice fly with runners on first and third, but the Cubs tied the game in the bottom half when Hank Borowy doubled with two outs and scored on Stan Hack&#x27;s single. In the sixth, Cramer hit a leadoff single and scored on Hank Greenberg&#x27;s double. After a single, Rudy York&#x27;s RBI single knocked starter Hank Borowy out of the game. Hy Vandenberg in relief intentionally walked Paul Richards with one out to load the bases before a walk to Newhouser and Skeeter Webb&#x27;s groundout scored a run each. Next inning, Jimmy Outlaw&#x27;s sacrifice fly with runners on first and third off Paul Derringer made it 6–1 Tigers. In the bottom of the inning, with runners on first and third with two outs, Bill Nicholson&#x27;s fielder&#x27;s choice and Mickey Livingston&#x27;s ground-rule double scored a run each. In the ninth, after a hit-by-pitch and double, Roy Cullenbine&#x27;s two-run double off Paul Erickson made it 8–3 Tigers. In the bottom half, Phil Cavarretta hit a leadoff double and scored on Nicholson&#x27;s one out single before Newhouser retired the next two batters to end the game and put the Tigers one win away from the championship. The Cubs&#x27; World Series record at Wrigley Field now stood at 1–10.

===Game 6===

In Game 6, the Tigers struck first on a bases-loaded walk to Paul Richards by Claude Passeau in the second. In the fifth with the bases loaded off Virgil Trucks, Stan Hack&#x27;s two-run single put the Cubs up 2–1. After another walk loaded the bases, Phil Cavarretta&#x27;s two-run single knocked Trucks out of the game. Back-to-back leadoff doubles next inning by Mickey Livingston and Roy Hughes off Tommy Bridges made it 5–1 Cubs. In the top of the seventh with two on and two outs, RBI singles by Roy Cullenbine off Passeau and Rudy York off Hank Wyse cut the Cubs&#x27; lead to 5–3, but they got those runs back in the bottom half on a bases loaded walk to Livingston by Bridges followed by Roy Hughes&#x27;s RBI single off Al Benton. In the top of the eighth, after a leadoff walk and double, an error on Joe Hoover&#x27;s ground ball scored a run, then Eddie Mayo&#x27;s RBI single scored another with Hoover going to third and Mayo being tagged out at second. Ray Prim relieved Wyse and allowed a sacrifice fly to Doc Cramer before Hank Greenberg&#x27;s home run tied the game. In the 12th, after a one-out single by Frank Secory off Dizzy Trout, pinch-runner Bill Schuster came all the way around on Stan Hack&#x27;s walk-off double to left, forcing a Game 7.

Besides being the last World Series game the Cubs won until Game 2 in 2016, this would also be the second—and last—World Series game that the Cubs would win before their hometown fans at Wrigley Field, until Game 5 in 2016. The only other Wrigley victory was Game 5 in 1935.

===Game 7===

The Cubs went with the overworked Borowy, who lasted just three batters, each of whom singled, the last of which scored a run. Paul Derringer replaced him, intentionally walked Roy Cullenbine with one out to load the bases, then one out later, walked Jimmy Outlaw before Paul Richards cleared the bases with a three-run double. The Cubs got a run in the bottom of the first on Phil Cavarretta&#x27;s RBI single with two on off Hal Newhouser, but in the second, Derringer allowed a two-out single, then three consecutive walks to force in another run. The Cubs got another run in the fourth when Cavaretta singled and scored on Andy Pafko&#x27;s triple. In the seventh, Cullenbine drew a leadoff walk off Paul Erickson and scored on Paul Richards&#x27;s two-out double. Next inning, Skeeter Webb drew a leadoff walk off Claude Passeau and scored on Eddie Mayo&#x27;s double. After moving to third on a groundout, he scored on Hank Greenberg&#x27;s sacrifice fly. The Cubs scored just one more run in the bottom of the inning on Bill Richardson&#x27;s RBI double with two on as Newhouser pitched a complete game to give the Tigers the championship.

The Tigers would not make another World Series appearance until winning it in , while the Cubs would not make the postseason again until 1984 and not appear in another World Series until winning it in .

<text>Anna Ford (born 2 October 1943) is an English retired journalist, television presenter and newsreader. She first worked as a researcher, news reporter and later newsreader for Granada Television, ITN, and the BBC. Ford helped launch the British breakfast television broadcaster TV-am. She retired from broadcast news presenting in April 2006 and was a non-executive director of Sainsbury&#x27;s until the end of 2012. Ford now lives in her home town of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire.

==Early life==
Ford was born in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, to parents who were both West End actors. Her father, John, had declined an offer from Samuel Goldwyn to work in Hollywood, and her mother, Jean (née Winstanley; sister of MP and broadcaster Michael Winstanley, Baron Winstanley) had worked with Alec Guinness. Her father later became ordained as an Anglican priest and took Ford and her four brothers to live at Eskdale in the Lake District. She went to primary school at St Ursula&#x27;s School, Wigton, then to Wigton Grammar School, where she was a contemporary of Melvyn Bragg. After her father became the parish priest at St Martin&#x27;s Church in Brampton she moved to the White House Grammar School. She also attended Minehead Grammar School in Somerset and lived in nearby Wootton Courtenay.

Ford received a BA degree in economics from the Victoria University of Manchester and was president of the university&#x27;s students&#x27; union from 1966 to 1967.

==Career==
Ford worked as a teacher for four years, including teaching Provisional Irish Republican Army prisoners at Her Majesty&#x27;s Prison Maze in Northern Ireland for two years. She was later an Open University social studies tutor in Belfast for two years. Ford was thirty by the time that she joined Granada Television as a researcher in 1974. Initially, she was told she was too old to be a newsreader, but became a reporter and newsreader on &quot;Granada Reports&quot;. She joined the BBC in January 1977, but only after several months as security clearance from MI5 was required because she was then living with a former communist. This led to her BBC personnel file being marked with a &quot;Christmas tree&quot; symbol. Ford subsequently worked on &quot;Man Alive&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;.

In February 1978, Ford moved to ITN, and briefly faced legal threats from the BBC for breaking her contract. Future colleague Reginald Bosanquet said at the time: &quot;I have never been averse to working with ladies ... I do not know Anna but I have heard that she is a very competent and professional lady&quot;, Ford and he formed a good professional relationship. Ford began presenting ITV&#x27;s &quot;News at One&quot; in March and later the 5:45 pm bulletin, but within two months had become the first female newscaster on &quot;News at Ten&quot;. 

In 1979, Ford appeared in a skit along with John Cleese and Terry Jones of the Monty Python troupe as part of &quot;The Amnesty International Comedy Gala&quot;, a comedy programme performed at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Haymarket, London. The film version is called &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;.

In 1981, she left ITN to join the presenting team of the soon-to-launch TV-am. ITN were bidding for the breakfast franchise themselves and had positioned Ford as the lead anchor in their bid, unaware that she was involved with another bidder. When her subterfuge was exposed, ITN immediately terminated her contract and publicly criticized her dishonesty and disloyalty. Her tenure at TV-am was short lived in part due to fierce competition from the BBC&#x27;s casually styled &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;. The loss of viewers resulted in a relaunch which was perceived as &quot;dumbing-down&quot; of the station, and only three months after the station&#x27;s launch, Ford was dismissed from TV-am partly due to her on-air support for chairman Peter Jay (who had already resigned) and partly because she refused to stand down from &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; when the ratings slumped. Ford was involved in an incident at a party in which she threw her wine over Jonathan Aitken to express her outrage over his involvement in her sacking from the channel.

Ford re-joined the BBC in summer 1986, Firstly to cover for Wogan in June, and other minor roles. From January 1987 was given her own programme &quot;Network&quot; in which member of the public were able discusses issues with BBC management. Anna, become part of the presentation team for both BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; from February 1989 &quot; and the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Today&quot; in 1993. From 1999, she fronted the relaunched &quot;One O&#x27;Clock News&quot;.

On 30 October 2005, Ford announced she would retire from broadcasting in April 2006 to pursue other interests while she &quot;still has the interest and energy&quot;. She also talked about ageism, stating:
Ford presented her last &quot;One O&#x27;Clock News&quot; on 27 April 2006, signing off by introducing a compilation of clips of her career. On 2 May 2006, J Sainsbury plc, the UK supermarket group, announced Ford was joining the company as a non-executive director. She is the Chair of Sainsbury&#x27;s board&#x27;s Corporate Responsibility Committee.

===Academia===
On 17 December 2001, Ford was installed as Chancellor of the Victoria University of Manchester. When the Victoria University of Manchester merged with the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) on 1 October 2004 to create the new University of Manchester, she became its Co-Chancellor along with Sir Terry Leahy (the former Chancellor of UMIST). She completed her term and Tom Bloxham succeeded her as sole Chancellor on 1 August 2008.

On 22 April 2006, Ford received an honorary doctorate from the University of St Andrews, nominated by Sir Menzies Campbell.

===Other work===
Ford is one of many guest hosts to have taken the chair for the satirical news quiz &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ford had an early marriage to Alan Bittles (1970–div), although this was dissolved before her television career began. In the late 1970s, she was briefly engaged to Jon Snow, a colleague at ITN. She married the magazine editor and cartoonist Mark Boxer in 1981; with whom she had two daughters, before he died of a brain tumour in 1988 at their home in Brentford, Greater London.

She was briefly engaged in 2000 to former astronaut David Scott, the seventh man to walk on the Moon. Ford became the subject of news stories in August 2001, when she lost a high-profile court case. She claimed unsuccessfully that photographs of her in a bikini with Scott, taken by a press photographer in Majorca with a powerful zoom lens and published in the British media, constituted an invasion of her privacy.

In a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in February 2010, Ford accused Martin Amis (a friend of her late husband Mark Boxer) of having neglected his duties as godfather to one of her daughters and also having been disrespectful to Boxer at the time of his death. Amis rejected her allegations in a reply, but accepted that he had been remiss in his duties as godfather.

<doc id="557988" wikidata="Q5719487" url="?curid=557988" title="Henry Clay Folger">
<text>Henry Clay Folger Jr. (June 18, 1857 – June 11, 1930) was an American businessman who was president and later chairman of Standard Oil of New York, a collector of Shakespeareana, and founder of the Folger Shakespeare Library.

==Early life==

Henry Clay Folger Jr. was born in New York City to Henry Clay Folger Sr. of Nantucket, Massachusetts, and Eliza Jane (Clark) Folger of New York, the eldest of their eight children. He was a first cousin six times removed of Benjamin Franklin and a nephew of J. A. Folger, the founder of Folger Coffee. He descended from Peter Foulger (the maternal grandfather of Benjamin Franklin) and Mary Foulger (née Morrill).

He graduated from Adelphi Academy, in Brooklyn, New York, where Charles Pratt, the businessman and president of Adelphi&#x27;s board of trustees, became a mentor to him. At Adelphi, Folger was schooled in art, chemistry, classics, and recitation, and was elected president of the school&#x27;s literary association. He then attended Amherst College with Charles Millard Pratt, a close friend and son of Folger&#x27;s mentor at Adelphi. To fund his education, Folger competed in many oratorical essay contests, winning prizes in 1876 and again in 1879, which paid for his junior year of school. Folger modeled his rhetorical style on Daniel Webster&#x27;s. He identified a Shakespeare-related essay contest as the origin of his obsession with the Bard. His wife, Emily, however, would later attribute Folger&#x27;s initial fascination with Shakespeare to an 1879 lecture by Ralph Waldo Emerson, whose eloquent delivery sounded Shakespearean to the college student. At Amherst, Folger was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1879. Following graduation, he attended Columbia Law School from 1879 to 1881, gaining admittance to the bar in 1881.
==Career==
Beginning in 1881, he worked for the Standard Oil trust of John D. Rockefeller, getting his start in the oil business as a clerk at Charles Pratt &amp; Company, a refinery owned by Charles Pratt, the father of his Adelphi and Amherst classmate Charles Millard Pratt. The Pratt Company was already associated with Standard Oil at that time. Folger quickly showed his prowess as a mathematician and statistician; his management of data on oil processing led to a promotion in 1886, when he became the secretary of Standard Oil&#x27;s manufacturing committee. In 1890, Folger wrote &quot;Petroleum: Its Production and Products in Pennsylvania&quot;, an article for Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia about the oil business.

Folger&#x27;s assets increased in 1899, when he was promoted to chairman of the manufacturing committee, the same year that Standard Oil of New Jersey became the central holding company for the Standard Oil Trust, which dissolved after the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The stock Folger held in Standard Oil of New Jersey would contribute significantly to Folger&#x27;s ability to collect Shakespeareana. In 1908, he was elected assistant treasurer of Jersey Standard, and joined its board of sixteen directors, managing the company&#x27;s finances and compiling production data. That year, Folger was also elected to Jersey Standard&#x27;s executive committee.

The 1911 Supreme Court decision to break up the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey monopoly resulted in the election of Folger as president of the second-largest company formed from the dissolved Jersey Standard, the Standard Oil Company of New York, or Socony. Folger also owned significant amounts of stock in the Magnolia Petroleum Company, a Texan company that became a fully owned subsidiary of Socony in 1925. He retired as president in 1923, but stayed at Socony as the first chairman of its board of trustees until 1928, when he officially retired to devote all of his attention to plans for his Shakespeare Library. Folger was succeeded as president by Herbert L. Pratt, another son of Charles Pratt.

In 1956, the Folger Shakespeare Library received Folger&#x27;s walnut desk from Socony Mobil Oil. Since that year, it has been used by the Library&#x27;s director.

==Marriage to Emily Clara Jordan==
Henry Clay Folger met Emily Clara Jordan in the early 1880s at a meeting of the Irving Literary Circle in Brooklyn. Both were close, respectively, with the Pratt siblings Charles and Lillie. Early in their relationship, Henry and Emily connected via Shakespeare. At an 1882 picnic held by the Irving Literary Circle, Charles and Lillie prompted the two to each give a toast; Emily drew from &quot;Othello&quot;. while Henry quoted from &quot;As You Like It&quot;. She was born in 1858 and was educated at Vassar College. They married on October 6, 1885 at Westminster Presbyterian Church in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where Emily had spent her teenage years. The Folgers had no children. They lived in rented houses in Brooklyn throughout most of their lives, moving to Bedford-Stuyvesant in 1895 and to 24 Brevoot Place in 1910, but later purchased an estate in Glen Cove, Long Island in 1929.

The Folgers took annual vacations to The Homestead resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, where Henry enjoyed participating in golf tournaments in his later years. Though the Folgers had no children, they considered their collection to be their descendants, and Henry was known to refer to his rare books as &quot;the boys&quot;.

==Shakespeare collecting==
Folger was an avid collector of Shakespeareana, assembling the world&#x27;s largest collection of First Folio editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. The first rare book Folger acquired was a 1685 copy of the Fourth Folio, purchased in 1889 for $107.50. He purchased his first original copy of the First Folio four years later, in 1893. Unlike other wealthy collectors of the period, like Henry E. Huntington and J.P. Morgan, Folger favored &quot;imperfect&quot; copies of rare volumes, with their marginalia and other markings. Following this trend, his Folio collection was marked with diversity in provenance and condition. He preferred to purchase Early Editions of books published between 1567 and 1606, in addition to manuscripts of the period. Based on their collective knowledge of Latin and French, and Emily&#x27;s proficiency in German, the couple also favored rare volumes published on the Continent in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The couple was less interested in art collection, and many of the Shakespeare-related paintings they purchased were misattributed to artists like Thomas Gainsborough.

The Folgers chose items to purchase from booksellers&#x27; catalogues, which were initially perused and marked up by Emily, before she passed them on to Henry, who kept an extensive and precise list of items he intended to bid on. If possible, he inspected an item personally before purchasing it. He also avoided consulting scholarly experts about rare volumes, preferring his own and Emily&#x27;s expertise, as she received an M.A. from Vassar College in 1896 for a thesis on Shakespeare. Folger used professional booksellers as middlemen at auctions, believing that the concealment of his identity would keep prices low. Due to the growing size of the collection and their concern for fireproofing, eventually few of the Folgers&#x27; acquisitions were stored in their living space. They kept an extensive card catalog at home in Brooklyn, and when traveling, took a smaller, annotated set of check lists along with them. The collection itself was stored among several fireproof warehouse companies throughout Manhattan, in specially-designed wooden cases originally meant to hold two five-gallon cans of oil each. Frederick Fales, a co-worker of Folger&#x27;s at Standard Oil, initially designed and ordered these air-tight wooden cases for company use. Some of the most valuable items were kept in bank vaults, or in a safe in Folger&#x27;s office.

Folger financed a half-century of collecting with his Standard Oil salary and extensive investments in the company. His high placement at Standard Oil also allowed him to take out loans with his friend Charles Millard Pratt, John D. Rockefeller, and even his wife, to fund his purchases. He generally paid for items in cash, a strategy that earned him the favor of many booksellers who needed immediate funds. Folger also preferred to purchase whole collections, like the Halliwell-Phillipps collection, acquired in 1908, because bulk purchases drove down prices of individual items.

In 1909, Folger established a Shakespeare Prize at Amherst; winning students won a cash prize, and their essays joined Folger&#x27;s collection and currently reside in the Folger Shakespeare Library. Folger also made donations to Amherst College&#x27;s library, contributing many duplicate volumes purchased at auction to the College. The most valuable of these donations were two leaves from a Gutenberg Bible.

==Folger Shakespeare Library==

Early in his career at Standard Oil and as a collector, Folger doubted that he would eventually have the funds to build a memorial or library for his growing collection, and in 1895 he offered to sell it to John D. Rockefeller, who refused. Before he acquired the funds for what was to become the Folger Shakespeare Library, Folger also debated selling the collection to a university.

Toward the end of World War I, Folger and his wife began searching for a location for his Shakespeare library. Among the sites he and Emily considered were Amherst and Nantucket, Massachusetts, the University of Chicago, New York City, and Stratford-upon-Avon, before they settled on a Washington, D.C. site they discovered in 1918 during a layover in the city while traveling to Hot Springs. Folger spent nine years purchasing the fourteen row houses that occupied the block of East Capitol Street between First and Second Streets, which he would demolish to build his Library; thus, they did not make their choice of a site on Capitol Hill public until 1928. Soon afterwards, Congress passed a resolution allowing use of the land on East Capitol Street where the Folger Shakespeare Library now stands.

After the passage of this legislation, Folger hired Paul Philippe Cret as the Library&#x27;s architect, suggested by Alexander Trowbridge, an architect who had married into the Pratt family and stayed on the project as consulting architect. Folger played an integral part in the design and execution of the Library&#x27;s classical exterior and Tudor interior. The inclusion of an Elizabethan theater within the Library&#x27;s main building was also Folger&#x27;s idea, though he intended it as a venue for academic lectures rather than performances. Folger hired sculptor John Gregory to design the relief sculptures that appear on the building&#x27;s facade. The cornerstone of the library was laid in 1930, but Henry Folger died soon afterward. The bulk of his fortune was left in trust for the library, with Amherst College as trust administrator. With additional funding from Emily Folger, the library opened in 1932 on April 23, the date traditionally believed to be Shakespeare&#x27;s birthday. Folger&#x27;s collection of Shakespearean works is considered one of the most important resources for scholars of the playwright.

==Other interests and activities==

Folger was a trustee of the Hamilton Trust Company, Brooklyn, New York, and a director of Seaboard National Bank in New York. In 1914 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Amherst. Outside of work, his great interests were his Shakespeare collection and, in later life, golf, which he often played with Rockefeller. He was a trustee of the Central Congregational Church in Brooklyn and established the Shakespeare Garden at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

In a 1933 lecture delivered after his death, Emily identified &quot;King Lear&quot; as his favorite of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

==Death==
In May 1930, Henry Folger was admitted to St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Brooklyn for surgery on an enlarged prostate. While recovering, he continued to work on the construction and development of his Shakespeare Library from his sickbed. He later had a second prostate operation prior to his death on June 11, 1930. His funeral was held at Brooklyn&#x27;s Central Congregational Church, where he had been an active member. Reverend Samuel Parkes Cadman, who, along with his wife, had been close with the Folgers, gave Henry&#x27;s eulogy. Henry&#x27;s ashes were interred beneath the Folgers&#x27; copy of Shakespeare&#x27;s funerary monument in what is now the Folger Shakespeare Library&#x27;s Old Reading Room. His wife Emily died in 1936.

==Writings==
Folger wrote &quot;Petroleum: Its Production and Products&quot; and articles on Shakespeare and Shakespeareana.

<doc id="557994" wikidata="Q781075" url="?curid=557994" title="Craniosacral therapy">
<text>Craniosacral therapy (CST) orcranial osteopathy is a form of alternative medicine that uses gentle touch to feel non-existent rhythmic movements of the skull&#x27;s bones and supposedly adjust the immovable joints of the skull to achieve a therapeutic result. CST is a pseudoscience and its practice has been characterized as quackery. It is based on fundamental misconceptions about the anatomy and physiology of the human skull and is promoted as a cure-all for a variety of health conditions.

Medical research has found no significant evidence that either CST or cranial osteopathy confers any health benefit, and attempts to manipulate the bones of the skull can be harmful, particularly for children or infants. The basic assumptions of CST are not true, and practitioners produce conflicting and mutually exclusive diagnoses of the same patients.

==Effectiveness and safety==
Practitioners of CST claim it is effective in treating a wide range of conditions, sometimes claiming it is a cancer cure, or a cure-all. Practitioners particularly advocate the use of CST on children. The American Cancer Society cautions that CST should never be used on children under age two. Pediatricians have expressed concern at the harm CST can cause to children and infants. 

There is no evidence that CST is of use for people with autism and its use is potentially harmful. at least two deaths had been reported resulting from CST spinal manipulation. In a small study, participants with head injuries suffered worsening symptoms as a result of CST. Additionally, if used as the sole treatment for serious health conditions, choosing CST can have serious adverse consequences; the American Cancer Society recommends those with cancer or chronic conditions should consult their doctor before starting any therapy consisting of manual manipulation.

According to the American Cancer Society, although CST may relieve the symptoms of stress or tension, &quot;available scientific evidence does not support claims that craniosacral therapy helps in treating cancer or any other disease&quot;. Cranial osteopathy has received a similar assessment, with one 1990 paper finding there was no scientific basis for any of the practitioners&#x27; claims the paper examined. 

The evidence base for CST is sparse and lacks a demonstrated biologically plausible mechanism. In the absence of rigorous, well-designed randomized controlled trials, it is a pseudoscience, and its practice quackery. Tests show that CST practitioners cannot in fact identify the purported craniosacral pulse, and different practitioners will get different results for the same patient. The idea of a craniosacral rhythm cannot be scientifically supported.

=== Systematic reviews ===
In October 2012, Edzard Ernst conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials of craniosacral therapy. He concluded that &quot;the notion that CST is associated with more than non-specific effects is not based on evidence from rigorous randomised clinical trials.&quot; Commenting specifically on this conclusion, Ernst wrote on his blog that he had chosen the wording as &quot;a polite and scientific way of saying that CST is bogus.&quot; Ernst also remarked that the quality of five of the six trials he had reviewed was &quot;deplorably poor,&quot; a sentiment that echoed an August 2012 review that noted the &quot;moderate methodological quality of the included studies.&quot;

Ernst criticized a 2011 systematic review performed by Jakel and von Hauenschild for including observational studies and including studies with healthy volunteers. This review concluded that the evidence base surrounding craniosacral therapy and its efficacy was sparse and composed of studies with heterogeneous design. The authors of this review stated that currently available evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions.

A 2019 systematic review found limited evidence that CST may bring some relief for up to six months for people with chronic pain. However, the conclusions of this study were disputed by the Office for Science and Society at McGill University due to the poor methodological quality of the individual studies that made up the analysis.

=== Regulation ===
Edzard Ernst wrote that in 2005 in the United Kingdom, a foundation of then-Prince Charles issued a booklet listing CST as one of several popular alternative therapies, but admitted that the therapy was unregulated and lacked either a defined training program or the oversight of a professional body. Ernst wrote that this makes the therapists practising CST &quot;less regulated than publicans.&quot;

==History ==

Cranial osteopathy, a forerunner of CST, was devised in the 1930s by William Garner Sutherland. While looking at a disarticulated skull, Sutherland was struck by the idea that the cranial sutures of the temporal bones where they meet the parietal bones were &quot;beveled, like the gills of a fish, indicating articular mobility for a respiratory mechanism.&quot;

CST was invented by John Upledger, as an offshoot of cranial osteopathy. From 1975 to 1983, Upledger and neurophysiologist and histologist Ernest W. Retzlaff worked at Michigan State University as clinical researchers and professors. They assembled a research team to investigate the purported pulse and further study Sutherland&#x27;s theory of cranial bone movement. Later, independent reviews of these studies concluded that they presented no good evidence for the effectiveness of craniosacral therapy or the existence of the proposed cranial bone movement.

== Conceptual basis ==
Practitioners of both cranial osteopathy and CST assert that there are small, rhythmic motions of the cranial bones attributed to cerebrospinal fluid pressure or arterial pressure. The premise of CST is that palpation of the cranium can be used to detect this rhythmic movement of the cranial bones and selective pressures may be used to manipulate the cranial bones to achieve a therapeutic result. However, there is no evidence that the bones of the human skull can be moved by such manipulations.

The fundamental concepts of cranial osteopathy and CST are inconsistent with the human skull, brain, and spine&#x27;s known anatomy and physiology. Edzard Ernst has written &quot;to anyone understanding a bit of physiology, anatomy etc. [CST] looks like pure nonsense.&quot;

In common with many other varieties of alternative medicine, CST practitioners believe all illness is caused by energy or fluid blockages which can be released by physical manipulation. They believe that the bones of the skull move in a rhythmic pattern which they can detect and correct.

The therapist lightly palpates the patient&#x27;s body, and focuses intently on the communicated movements. A practitioner&#x27;s feeling of being in tune with a patient is described as &quot;entrainment&quot;.

Comparing CST to cranial osteopathy, Upledger wrote: &quot;Dr. Sutherland&#x27;s discovery regarding the flexibility of skull sutures led to the early research behind CranioSacral Therapy– and both approaches affect the cranium, sacrum and coccyx– the similarities end there.&quot; However, modern-day cranial osteopaths largely consider the two practices to be the same, but that cranial osteopathy has &quot;been taught to non-osteopaths under the name CranialSacral therapy.&quot;

<doc id="557995" wikidata="Q887732" url="?curid=557995" title="Mangrai">
<text>Mangrai (; ; c. 1238–1311) was the 25th king of Ngoenyang (r. 1261–1292) and the first king of Lanna (r. 1292–1311). He established a new city, Chiang Mai, as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom (1296–1558).

==Early years==

King Mangrai the Great was born on 23 October 1238, in Ngoen Yang (present day Chiang Saen), Thailand, on the Mekong River, a son of the local ruler Lao Meng and his wife Ua Ming Chom Mueang, a princess from the Tai Lue city of Chiang Rung, which is now called Jinghong, in Sipsongpanna (Xishuangbanna), China.

In 1259, Mangrai succeeded his father to become the first independent king of the unified Tai city states in northern Lanna and what is now northern Laos. Seeing the Tai states disunited and in danger, Mangrai quickly expanded his kingdom by conquering Muang Lai, Chiang Kham and Chiang Khong and initiating alliances with other states.

In 1262, he founded the city of Chiang Rai as his new capital in the Kok River basin. He also seems to have been operating around this time in the area of Fang in the Upper Kok Valley.

In 1287, Mangrai first made peace between King Ngam Muang of Phayao and King Ram Khamhaeng of Sukhothai, who had seduced the former&#x27;s queen. The three kings then entered into a &quot;Strong pact of friendship&quot;.

While still living in the area of Fang, he was visited by merchants from the Mon kingdom of Haripunchai (Haripunjaya, now known as Lamphun). Hearing of the wealth of that kingdom, he was determined to conquer it, against the advice of his counselors. As it was thought impossible to take the city by force, Mangrai sent a merchant named Ai Fa as a mole to gain the confidence of its King Yi Ba. In time, Ai Fa became the Chief Minister and managed to undermine the King&#x27;s authority.

In 1291, with the people in a state of discontent, Mangrai defeated the Mon kingdom and added Haripunchai to his kingdom. Yi Ba, the last king of Hariphunchai, was forced to flee south to Lampang.

==Chiang Mai Era==
After defeating the Hariphunchai kingdom, Mangrai decided to relocate his capital, and in 1294, Wiang Kum Kam was founded on the eastern bank of the Ping River. The site was plagued with floods, and a new site was chosen several kilometres to the northwest at the foot of Doi Suthep, on the site of an older fortified town of the Lua people. Construction of Chiang Mai (lit. &quot;New City&quot;) began in 1296. and it has been the capital of the northern provinces more or less ever since.

A few years later, Yi Ba&#x27;s son, King Boek of Lampang, attacked Chiang Mai with a large army. King Mangrai and his second son, Prince Khram, led the defence against the Lampang army.

Prince Khram defeated King Boek in personal combat on elephant-back at Khua Mung, a village near Lamphun. King Boek fled by way of the Doi Khun Tan mountain range between Lamphun and Lampang, but he was caught and executed. King Mangrai&#x27;s troops occupied the city of Lampang, and King Yi Ba was made to flee further south, this time to Phitsanulok.

==Death and succession==
King Mangrai&#x27;s eldest son grew tired of waiting and tried to seize the throne, but his attempt failed and he was executed. Mangrai&#x27;s second son, Khun Kham, was then named to succeed Mangrai.

King Mangrai died in 1311 in Chiang Mai. According to tradition, he was struck by lightning during a thunderstorm when he was in the city&#x27;s market.

Mangrai&#x27;s death was followed by period of confusion, with six kings ruling in the next eleven years. This could have been disastrous if the northern powers had not had their own troubles. Sukhothai to the south had also been weakened.

Not until the ascension of Mangrai&#x27;s grandson, Kham Fu, in 1328 did the kingdom achieve the stability it had had during the lifetime of its founder.

<text>Constantine Alexander Payne (born February 10, 1961) is an American film director, screenwriter and producer. He is noted for his satirical depictions of contemporary American society. Payne has received numerous accolades, including two Academy Awards, a BAFTA Award and two Golden Globe Awards as well as a nomination for a Grammy Award.

After directing several short films, Payne made his feature film debut with the black comedy &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; (1996). His career progressed with the political satire &quot;Election&quot; (1999), for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and the comedy-drama &quot;About Schmidt&quot; (2002). Payne twice won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for co-writing his directorials &quot;Sideways&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Descendants&quot; (2011). He was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for these two films and for the road film &quot;Nebraska&quot; (2013). He has since directed the comedy-dramas &quot;Downsizing&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Holdovers&quot; (2023).

== Early life and education ==
Payne was born in Omaha, Nebraska, to Peggy and George Payne, restaurant owners. He is the youngest of three sons and grew up in the Dundee neighborhood. He is of Greek ancestry. Payne&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Nicholas &quot;Nick&quot; Payne, anglicized the last name from &quot;Papadopoulos&quot;. His family comes from three areas in Greece: the island of Syros, Livadia, and Aegio. Payne&#x27;s family was part of the fabric of Omaha, which he refers to as part of his upbringing. His grandfather was a founder of The Virginia Cafe, with Payne&#x27;s father taking over the restaurant. Payne went there regularly as a child. The restaurant was destroyed in a fire in 1969; the W. Dale Clark Library was later built on the site. Payne&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Clara Payne (née Hoffman), was from a German Nebraska family from Lincoln, Nebraska.

In Omaha, Payne attended Brownell-Talbot School, Dundee Elementary School, and Lewis and Clark Junior High. He graduated from Creighton Prep for high school in 1979. At Prep, Payne wrote a humor column for his high school newspaper and was the editor of the high school yearbook. Payne then attended Stanford University, where he majored in Spanish and History. As a part of his Spanish degree, he studied at Spain&#x27;s University of Salamanca. He later lived a few months in Medellin, Colombia, where he published an article about social changes between 1900 and 1930. Payne received his MFA in 1990 from the UCLA Film School.

In the 1960s, Payne&#x27;s father received a Super 8mm projector from Kraft Foods as a loyalty reward, and eventually passed it on to his son when Alexander was about 14 years old.

== Career ==

=== 1985–1996: Short films and film debut ===
A short time after getting his MFA from UCLA Film School—and after his successful thesis film &quot;The Passion of Martin&quot; had attracted industry attention—Payne got a writing/directing deal with Universal Pictures. The ensuing screenplay, which was turned down, ultimately became &quot;About Schmidt&quot;. He says that he cleared about $60,000, which was enough to fund his simple lifestyle at the time for about five years. Payne has said he sees his talent as being one of learned economy, referring to the essay written by Tennessee Williams on &quot;The Catastrophe of Success.&quot; During this time Payne worked in various capacities on films and television including directing several films for the &quot;Playboy&quot; channel.

Payne co-wrote and directed his first full-length film, &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot;, which was released in 1996. The film is a satirical black comedy revolving around the issue of abortion rights. The film stars Laura Dern as a dim witted woman with substance abuse issues who happens to get pregnant. She unexpectedly becomes a pawn of figures from both sides of the abortion debate. The film co-stars Kelly Preston, Burt Reynolds, and Tippi Hedren. The film premiered at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival where it received favorable reviews. In Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; review she wrote, &quot;There&#x27;s no easy way out of this predicament, though Mr. Payne does beg the question with skill. And &quot;Citizen Ruth&quot; can easily be forgiven for not finding a fully satisfying ending. It delivers more than enough lively, gutsy satire along the way.&quot;

===1999–2013: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

His second film, &quot;Election&quot;, starring Matthew Broderick and Reese Witherspoon, which takes aim at politics and education in America, attracted attention when &quot;New Yorker&quot; film critic David Denby named it the best film of 1999. Payne received his first Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay nomination for &quot;Election&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four, praising Witherspoon and Payne, and saying, &quot;...here is a movie that is not simply about an obnoxious student, but also about an imperfect teacher, a lockstep administration, and a student body that is mostly just marking time until it can go out into the world and occupy valuable space&quot;. The film became a cult classic, ranking at #61 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot; and #9 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;50 Best High School Movies&quot;, while Witherspoon&#x27;s performance was ranked at #45 on the list of the &quot;100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time&quot; by &quot;Premiere&quot;. According to Payne, it is also President Barack Obama&#x27;s favorite political film.

In 2000, Payne completed an uncredited polish-up of the screenplay for the comedy film &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;. In 2001, Payne wrote a draft of &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. In 2002, Payne&#x27;s film &quot;About Schmidt&quot;, about a recently retired widower who embarks on a journey to his estranged daughter&#x27;s wedding, was released. The film starred Jack Nicholson as the title character, Warren Schmidt, and its script was based on the novel of the same name by Louis Begley. The film also co-starred Hope Davis, Dermot Mulroney, June Squibb, and Kathy Bates. The film premiered at the 55th Cannes Film Festival to rave reviews, with critics highlighting Nicholson&#x27;s performance. Payne received a Golden Globe for the screenplay, which was also nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. To the surprise of many who kept track of Hollywood news, Payne and Jim Taylor were not nominated for an Oscar for the &quot;About Schmidt&quot; screenplay.

In 2004, Payne followed &quot;About Schmidt&quot; with &quot;Sideways&quot;, a film about two middle-aged men who embark on a week-long road trip to Santa Barbara County wine country to celebrate Jack&#x27;s upcoming wedding. The film stars Paul Giamatti and Thomas Hayden Church as the two friends, with Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh. The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival where it received rave reviews. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars, saying: &quot;what happens during the seven days adds up to the best human comedy of the year – comedy, because it is funny, and human, because it is surprisingly moving.&quot; Payne won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe in 2005 for Best Adapted Screenplay, while the film also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. In total, &quot;Sideways&quot; received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.

In 2007 Payne served as an executive producer on the films &quot;King of California&quot; and &quot;The Savages&quot;. He also collaborated once again with writing partner Jim Taylor to write a draft of the screenplay for the film &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&quot; (2007), a comedy directed by Dennis Dugan, and starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James. Payne disliked the final product, stating that Adam Sandler rewrote so much of the story that almost all of what Payne and Taylor wrote was gone.

Payne returned to directing in 2011 after a seven-year hiatus with the film &quot;The Descendants&quot;, a film about a man dealing with the aftermath of a boating accident involving his wife, leaving her in a coma. The film starred George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Beau Bridges, Judy Greer, Matthew Lillard, and Robert Forster. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival where it received near universal praise ending up on many critics top 10 list of the year. Critics also hailed George Clooney&#x27;s performance with many citing it as his best. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Payne as a director writing, &quot;Payne knows the difference between lightness and frivolity, between seriousness and solemnity, between different kinds of cloud...Within a single scene the film can tap into deep feelings of pain, switch into comic modes as various as farce and satire, and confront and evade moral challenges.&quot; Payne also co-wrote the screenplay along with Nat Faxon, and Jim Rash who all won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Payne executive produced the short film &quot;Run Fast&quot;. Anna Musso, his long-time assistant and protégé, wrote and directed the film, which shot in March 2014. The project was partially funded by a Kickstarter campaign. Payne was also executive producer of the acclaimed 2014 film &quot;Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter&quot; directed by David Zellner. Payne&#x27;s &quot;Nebraska&quot; starred veteran character actor Bruce Dern (who received the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor) and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumnus Will Forte. It was released on November 15, 2013. The film received critical acclaim with David Edlestein of &quot;NPR&quot; describing it as a &quot;superb balancing act&quot; and adding, &quot;it&#x27;s a special kind of triumph&quot;. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture with Payne receiving a Best Director nomination, ultimately losing to Alfonso Cuarón for &quot;Gravity&quot;.

=== 2017–2022: Career slump ===
Payne has said that during his seven-year hiatus between &quot;Sideways&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Descendants&quot; (2011), he, along with working partner Jim Taylor, were developing the satire &quot;Downsizing&quot;, which Payne has described as &quot;a large canvas, science-fiction social satire&quot; and &quot;an epic masterpiece.&quot; The film, about an impoverished married couple who decide the way ahead lies in shrinking themselves, was to star Paul Giamatti and Reese Witherspoon, but was superseded by &quot;The Descendants&quot; and &quot;Nebraska.&quot; In March 2016, Witherspoon was replaced by Kristen Wiig and Giamatti by Matt Damon. Hong Chau, Christoph Waltz, Udo Kier, Neil Patrick Harris, and Jason Sudeikis also starred. Paramount Pictures released the film on December 22, 2017. It has received mixed reviews, with many critics describing it as the weakest film of Payne&#x27;s career.

=== 2023–present: Resurgence ===
In June 2021, it was announced that Payne would direct Paul Giamatti in the David Hemingson-scripted film &quot;The Holdovers&quot; for Miramax. The film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival to widespread critical acclaim. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; compared it to the films of Hal Ashby describing it as feeling as though it was a &quot;lost 70s classic&quot;. Stephen Farber of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; hailed it as &quot;an engaging and often touching comic drama that builds power as it moves toward its immensely satisfying conclusion.&quot;

While promoting &quot;The Holdovers&quot;, Payne announced that he was collaborating with Hemingson yet again on a long-time dream to make a Western film. &quot;I finally found a creative partner who shares the same zeal that I have for Westerns&quot;, Payne said. The film is said to be set in 1886 Custer County, Nebraska, and will feature Giamatti in a currently undisclosed role. Payne has cited the Westerns of Anthony Mann as an influence on the project.

Payne is also currently set for directing a Danish-language film to be shot in Denmark, fully funded by European sources.

=== Unrealized projects ===
In 1999, it was reported that Payne was in talks to direct &quot;Esquivel&quot;, a biopic starring John Leguizamo as Mexican musician Juan García Esquivel. He was also developing an adaptation of Paul Auster&#x27;s &quot;The Locked Room&quot; at the time.

In 2000, it was reported that Payne was to co-write and direct an untitled film inspired by Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;.
However, nothing more was heard of this project.

At one point, Payne was in talks to direct the remake of the 1966 heist comedy &quot;Gambit&quot;, after the Coen brothers did a rewrite of the film in 2003. He planned to reunite with Reese Witherspoon for the project, but he ultimately decided against it, reluctant to direct a script he didn&#x27;t write.

In November 2010, it was reported that Payne would possibly direct the film adaptation of Daniel Clowes&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Wilson&quot;. Then in November 2011, Payne confirmed that he was to direct &quot;Wilson&quot; next after &quot;Nebraska&quot; (2013). However, Payne officially confirmed in a 2014 interview with &quot;Parade&quot; that he was no longer attached to the &quot;Wilson&quot; project.

It was reported in 2011 that Payne was to direct a film titled &quot;Fork in the Road&quot;. That project was to have been an adaptation of a novel by Denis Hamill.

In 2012, it was reported that Payne and Jim Taylor wrote a script titled &quot;The Lost Cause&quot;, which was said to be an expansion of Taylor&#x27;s 2004 short film of the same name.

In November 2013, Payne was in talks to direct a film titled &quot;The Judge&#x27;s Will&quot; for Fox Searchlight Pictures. The project was to have been based on a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala about an elderly judge from Delhi who wants to make sure his much younger wife will be taken care of after his death. In May 2018, it was reported that James Ivory would write the screenplay of the project for Payne. In June 2018, it was reported that Payne will possibly shoot &quot;The Judge&#x27;s Will&quot; in Chicago.

In November 2014, it was announced that Payne would direct a film titled &quot;La Vida Norteña&quot;. The project was to have been about a Latin music promoter who befriends a Nebraskan mayor.

In April 2015, it was reported that Payne was interested in directing &quot;Septillion to One&quot;, a contemporary romantic comedy inspired by the true story of Joan Ginther, who won the Texas State Lottery four times. Adam R. Perlman and Graham Sack&#x27;s spec script was purchased by OddLot Entertainment, who intended to produce and finance the film. Payne was not officially committed to directing at the time, due to his preoccupation with the production of &quot;Downsizing&quot; (2017). In September 2016, Mark Romanek signed on to direct the film.

In February 2016, it was announced that Payne was to direct a film titled &quot;My Saga&quot;, which is based on a pair of articles written by Karl Ove Knausgård and published by &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. The articles cover Knausgård tracing the Vikings&#x27; voyages in North America. The film was to have been distributed by Netflix and star Mads Mikkelsen. In October 2019, the production was cancelled a week before filming was to begin due to Knausgard objecting to his life story being turned into a feature film.

In March 2018, Payne was in talks to direct a legal drama film for Amazon Studios titled &quot;The Burial&quot;. The project was based on the true story of Mississippi-based lawyer Willie Gary, who takes on the case of Jeremiah O&#x27;Keefe, an owner of a chain of funeral homes who claimed he was swindled by a major funeral parlor conglomerate. Maggie Betts took over as director and the film premiered in 2023 at the Toronto International Film Festival.

It was reported in February 2019 that Payne was attached to direct the comedy horror film &quot;The Menu&quot; for Gary Sanchez Productions. The plot concerns a young couple that attends an exclusive restaurant in a tropical island only to experience some &quot;shocking surprises.&quot; By April 2019, Emma Stone and Ralph Fiennes were set to star in the film. By May 2020, Mark Mylod replaced Payne on &quot;The Menu&quot;.

On December 2, 2019, it was announced that Payne was attached to direct an American remake of the 1987 Oscar-winning Danish film &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot;. Payne&#x27;s version is said to be set in Minnesota.

On December 20, 2019, it was announced that Payne was going to direct the HBO miniseries &quot;Landscapers&quot;. However, in October 2020, it was announced that Payne dropped out of the project due to a schedule conflict and was replaced by Will Sharpe.

In 2021, Payne said that one of his upcoming projects, which he planned to follow &quot;The Holdovers&quot;, would be a comedy set in Paris based on the true story of rival antique chair dealers, and that he was using the pandemic downtime to craft the screenplay. In 2023, Payne told &quot;IndieWire&quot; that he was working with Jim Taylor and a French screenwriting team, and that their script is &quot;maybe 65 percent there&quot;. Project is based on the 2018 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article &quot;The Chairmen&quot;.

In 2022, soon after the publication of &quot;Tracy Flick Can&#x27;t Win&quot;, the sequel novel to &quot;Election&quot;, a film adaptation was announced to be in works at Paramount+ with Reese Witherspoon set to reprise her role as Tracy Flick and Payne returning to direct and co-write.

On a 2023 episode of &quot;Happy Sad Confused&quot;, Payne revealed that one of his favorite scripts which had not been produced was a rewrite with Jim Taylor on a film called &quot;Tucker Ames as Himself&quot;, which he described as &quot;sort of a parody of a Bill Gates guy who gets his comeuppance in some way.&quot; In the same interview, Payne reiterated that he and Taylor were still discussing how to adapt &quot;Tracy Flick Can&#x27;t Win&quot;, attributing his desire to add Matthew Broderick&#x27;s character from the first film and veer away from &quot;making high school movies,&quot; since the novel is set at a high school again.

== Style ==
Payne has set many of his films in Omaha, his hometown. His films sometimes include scenes of historical landmarks, black and white photographs, and museums, and he often uses amateur actors for minor roles.

Payne is on the short list of directors who have final cut rights for their films.

In 2005, he became a member of the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Directors Branch).

==Personal life==
===Family===
Payne married Canadian actress Sandra Oh on January 1, 2003, after dating her for three years. On March 12, 2005, a publicist announced their separation. The divorce was officially finalized on December 22, 2006, although the former couple took more than two years to settle their finances. In 2015, Payne married Maria Kontos, whom he met while visiting the Aigio region of Greece where some of his ancestors originated. They welcomed a daughter in 2017, and divorced in 2022. In 2022 he received Greek citizenship.

===Philanthropy and business ventures===
Payne is on the Board of Directors of an Omaha non-profit film theater, Film Streams. He maintains a passion for preservation. In recent years, he helped preserve a historic film theater in Scottsbluff, Nebraska.

Payne was co-owner (along with friend Ann Beeder) of King Fong (now permanently closed), a Chinese restaurant in Omaha.

Payne is a long-time supporter of the Nebraska Coast Connection, a social networking organization that meets monthly in Culver City, California. In November 2013, he held a special screening of &quot;Nebraska&quot; for the group&#x27;s members at the Sherry Lansing Theatre on the Paramount Studios lot.

===Statutory rape allegation===
In a 2018 interview with Ronan Farrow, actress Rose McGowan accused a &quot;prominent” man in Hollywood of statutory rape but she did not name the person in question. In August 2020, McGowan said it was Payne and that he committed the act sometime in 1988 or 1989, when McGowan was 15 years old and Payne was about 28 years old.

Payne responded to McGowan&#x27;s allegation by writing a guest column in &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; in which he admitted to a consensual relationship with her, stating that they had met at some point in 1991 (McGowan turned 18 in September 1991) at an audition for a comic short film that he was directing for the Playboy Channel and had no reason to believe she was under the age of consent as the part required an actress who was of age. Payne ended his statement writing, &quot;While I cannot allow false statements about events 29 years ago to go uncorrected, I will continue to wish only the best for Rose&quot;.

<text>Eric Weiss is a fictional character, played by Greg Grunberg, from the television series &quot;Alias&quot;. He is one of Sydney Bristow&#x27;s CIA co-workers.

==Character biography==
Eric Weiss was a field agent at the CIA. He is a friend of most of the people at the CIA and often gives advice to the other characters, as an outside observer to all of the personal goings-on at the CIA. Weiss has a wry and sarcastic sense of humor which often comes out in his observations. He often walks into or defuses tense situations between Sydney and Vaughn. He is a descendant of Harry Houdini (whose real name was Ehrich Weiss [or Weisz]).

He initially served as a humorous foil and sounding board for Michael Vaughn in the first season, but with the integration of the former members of SD-6 and the CIA, he gives advice to many of the other characters, including Sydney and Marshall Flinkman.

When Marshall&#x27;s fiancée, Carrie Bowman, went into labor at CIA headquarters, she insisted on being married before the baby was born. Marshall quickly accessed the website for the dubious &quot;Internet Church of Mammals&quot; and obtained for Weiss the post of &quot;Exalted Minister&quot;, which allowed him to officiate at the impromptu wedding.

Weiss has played ice hockey in goal against Vaughn but really seems to like bowling (4.05 Liberty Village) because of the cheesy disco music, glow in the dark pins and all you can eat hot dogs after ten. He loves food, Sydney once commented the looked great and he said he&#x27;d given up all the food he enjoyed.

Weiss was the only member of Sydney&#x27;s CIA &quot;family&quot; who wasn&#x27;t recruited into the black-ops division of the CIA, dubbed &quot;APO,&quot; at the start of the fourth season, but this was soon rectified when he learned of the existence of APO during a mission in the third episode of the season.

Although there was the potential of a relationship beginning with Sydney Bristow during the third season, nothing developed. They were just good friends, Weiss gave Sydney a third edition Alice in Wonderland to try to make up for the loss of all her stuff in her apartment fire at the end of the second season. At the start of the fourth season, Weiss began a relationship with Sydney&#x27;s half-sister, Nadia Santos. In the second episode of season 4, upon meeting Nadia for the first time, he introduced himself as 38 and single.

In the second episode of the fifth season: &quot;...1...&quot; Eric Weiss was offered a job coordinating covert operations for the NSC, which was only a &quot;few steps from the President&quot;; at the end of the episode Weiss accepted the promotion and left the series. The character returned one final time in &quot;S.O.S.&quot; when he used his high ranking position to extract a team of APO agents who had infiltrated CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

In one episode he is heard speaking Dutch while on the telephone. He also speaks Spanish, French, and Russian but not as well as other field agents.

<doc id="558003" wikidata="Q3101643" url="?curid=558003" title="George Henry Murray">
<text>George Henry Murray (June 7, 1861 – January 6, 1929) was a Nova Scotia politician who served as the eighth premier of Nova Scotia for 26 years and 188 days, the longest unbroken tenure for a head of government in Canadian history.

==Early life and career==
Murray was born in Grand Narrows, Nova Scotia.
He was a member of the North British Society.

Despite his later political longevity, Murray&#x27;s early political career was marked by inability to get elected. He lost five consecutive elections at the federal and provincial level before he finally won a seat. Despite his electoral failures he was highly regarded within the Nova Scotia Liberal Party and was nominated by Nova Scotia Premier William Stevens Fielding as his successor after Fielding left provincial politics in 1896 to join the federal cabinet of Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Murray was sworn in as premier and took a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly when he was acclaimed as a candidate in Victoria County. 
==Premier of Nova Scotia==
As premier, Murray was a practitioner of brokerage politics. His government continued the public works projects of his predecessor, particularly in the area of railways by doubling the province&#x27;s track mileage within a decade, as well as road and bridge construction. His government was instrumental in improving the province&#x27;s postsecondary education system, particularly in agricultural and vocational education by the founding of the Nova Scotia Agricultural College at Bible Hill as well as the Nova Scotia Technical College in Halifax.

In 1906, the Liberals instituted prohibition. The Murray government also introduced workers&#x27; compensation in 1916 and instituted women&#x27;s suffrage in 1918.

The Murray government also introduced progressive labour legislation such as the Factories Act in 1908 and the act for workman&#x27;s compensation for injuries on the job in 1915. In the area of public health, that appointed public health officers, established county health clinics, and founded a research hospital for tuberculosis patients.

After almost three decades in power, Murray retired from politics in January 1923. He twice declined the offer of knighthood and twice refused earlier offers to join the federal cabinet of Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier. He died in Montreal.

Murray&#x27;s son George Belcher Murray later served in the provincial assembly.

<text>The Springfield Armory, more formally known as the United States Armory and Arsenal at Springfield located in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, was the primary center for the manufacture of United States military firearms from 1777 until its closing in 1968. It was the first federal armory and one of the first factories in the United States dedicated to the manufacture of weapons. The site is preserved as the Springfield Armory National Historic Site, Western Massachusetts&#x27; only unit of the national park system. It features the world&#x27;s largest collection of historic American firearms.

Famous first as the United States&#x27; primary arsenal during the American Revolutionary War, and then as the scene of a confrontation during Shays&#x27; Rebellion, the Springfield Armory in the 19th and 20th centuries became the site of numerous technological innovations of global importance, including interchangeable parts, the assembly line style of mass production, and modern business practices, such as hourly wages. The facility would play a decisive role in the American Civil War, producing most of the weaponry used by Union troops which, in sum, outpaced Confederate firearm production by a ratio of 32 to 1. American historian Merritt Roe Smith has posited that advancements in machine manufacturing which allowed the facility to increase production capacity by more than 25 fold, from 9,601 rifles in 1860 to 276,200 in 1864, served as a precursor to the mass production of the Second Industrial Revolution and 20th century assembly line production. The numerous firearm models produced at the Springfield Armory from 1794 to 1968 are referred to as &quot;Springfield muskets and rifles&quot;.

== Founding (1777) ==
Local and colonial militia used the bluff on which the Springfield Armory would become located during the 17th century for militia training, particularly after the Attack on Springfield during King Philip&#x27;s War.

In 1777, during the American Revolutionary War, George Washington scouted and approved the site of the Springfield Armory, after it was referred to him by General Henry Knox, his artillery chief. Although a small town at the time, Springfield, Massachusetts, offered obvious geographical advantages—it lay at the intersection of three rivers (including the major Connecticut River), and four major roads headed toward New York City, Boston, Albany, and Montreal. Additionally, Springfield is located just north of the Connecticut River&#x27;s first waterfall (Enfield Falls), which is too steep to be navigated by ocean-going vessels. Thus, Springfield was the first town on the Connecticut River protected from attack by seafaring naval vessels.

The Armory site itself sits atop a high bluff like a citadel, overlooking a wide stretch of the Connecticut River, at its confluence with the Westfield River. General Knox concurred with Washington that &quot;the plain just above Springfield is perhaps one of the most proper spots on every account&quot; for the location of an arsenal.

In 1777, patriot colonists established &quot;The Arsenal at Springfield&quot; to manufacture cartridges and gun carriages for the war effort. During the Revolution, the arsenal stored muskets, cannon, and other weapons. Patriots built barracks, shops, storehouses, and a magazine. Some doubt exists that the colonists manufactured arms during the Revolutionary War. After the war, the Army kept the facility to store arms for future needs. By the 1780s, the Springfield Arsenal functioned as a major ammunition and weapons arsenal.

Some time later, when manufacturing became important, the arsenal expanded to a second area south and west in Springfield, where water power was available. Around that time, the Mill River was dammed to form a mile-long lake called Watershops Pond. The main shops were behind the dam and a foundry was built below it. This factory was modernized, and the greater part of machining for Springfield and Garand rifles was conducted in it.

President George Washington appointed David Ames as first superintendent of the armory. His father Capt. John Ames was a blacksmith who had provided guns to the Colonial army.

== Shays&#x27; Rebellion (1787) ==
In 1786 and 1787, American Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays led an armed, populist uprising that attempted to overthrow the Government of Massachusetts. On January 25, 1787, thousands of Shays&#x27; Regulators marched on the Springfield Armory, hoping to seize its weaponry and force a change of government. That day the Springfield Armory was defended by state militia, who fired grapeshot at the rebels, forcing them to flee. This confrontation proved decisive, as Shays&#x27; Rebellion was crushed soon thereafter, and some of its participants tried for treason.

Shays&#x27; Rebellion directly influenced the delegates at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Washington cited it as his reason for coming out of retirement. During the debates over the U.S. Constitution, in encouraging a stronger Federal government, James Madison cautioned the attendees that &quot;the rebellion in Massachusetts is a warning, gentlemen.&quot;
==Production (1795–1968)==

===Early years===
In 1793, the National Arsenal contained brass ordnance, howitzers, traveling carriages, shot strapt, canisters filled, quilted grape, iron shot, shells, powder, musket ball, cylinders, caps, paper cartridges, fuzes filled, muskets, swords, various military stores, and implements. In 1795, the Springfield Armory produced the new nation&#x27;s first musket - the Model 1795 Musket which was largely patterned after the French Charleville musket which had armed the French army during the American Revolution.

===Early 19th century===

The Armory played a major role in providing weapons for the American Army during the War of 1812. Its monthly reports to the War Department are online, and they indicate it made 9588 new muskets in 1814 and repaired 5190 old ones that year. It several times reported that its funding had been delayed.

Fueled by the Springfield Armory, the City of Springfield quickly became a national center for invention and development. In 1819 Thomas Blanchard developed a special lathe for the consistent mass production of rifle stocks. Thomas Blanchard worked at Springfield Armory for 5 years. The lathe enabled an unskilled workman to quickly and easily turn out identical irregular shapes. The large drum turned two wheels: a friction wheel that followed the contours of the metal rifle pattern, and the cutting wheel that imitated the movements of the friction wheel to make an exact replica of the pattern in wood. In the 1840s the old flintlock gave way to a percussion ignition system that increased the reliability and simplicity of longarms.
The Springfield Armory was largely involved in the growth and influence of the Industrial Revolution. Much of this grew out of the military&#x27;s fascination with interchangeable parts, which was based on the theory that it would be easier to simply replace firearm parts than make battlefield repairs. Mass production of truly interchangeable parts demanded greater use of machines, improved gauging, quality control, and division of labor; all characteristics of the Industrial Revolution. From these individual components, the concept of the assembly line was devised.

The Springfield Armory also contributed to improved business management techniques. Colonel Roswell Lee, hired as superintendent in 1815, brought centralized authority, cost accounting for payroll, time, and materials, and increased discipline to a manufacturing environment—all business practices still in use today.

In 1843, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow visited the Armory and wrote his poem &quot;The Arsenal at Springfield.&quot; The anti-war poem described the rows of finished guns, by that point 1,000,000 stockpiled there, stored vertically in open racks: &quot;Like a huge organ, rise the burnished arms.&quot;

===Late 19th century===
With the destruction of the Harpers Ferry Armory early in the American Civil War, the Springfield Armory was briefly the only government manufacturer of arms, until the Rock Island Arsenal was established in 1862. During this time production ramped up to unprecedented levels never seen in American manufacturing up until that time, with only 9,601 rifles manufactured in 1860, rising to a peak of 276,200 by 1864. These advancements would not only give the Union a decisive technological advantage over the Confederacy during the war but served as a precursor to the mass production manufacturing that contributed to the post-war Second Industrial Revolution and 20th century machine manufacturing capabilities. American historian Merritt Roe Smith has drawn comparisons between the early assembly machining of the Springfield rifles and the later production of the Ford Model T, with the latter having considerably more parts, but producing a similar numbers of units in the earliest years of the 1913–1915 automobile assembly line, indirectly due to mass production manufacturing advancements pioneered by the armory 50 years earlier.

In 1865, Master Armorer Erskine Allin introduced the &quot;Allin Conversion,&quot; which incorporated the far more advanced design of breech-loading into the now-obsolete muzzleloaders, thereby extending their service life. In 1891 a new function was assigned to the Armory—it became the army&#x27;s main laboratory for the development and testing of new small arms.

One of the most distinctive elements of the Armory is the fence surrounding the site, which was started after the Civil War and completed in 1890. Unable to find funding for the purchase of a fence, Major James W. Ripley requested obsolete cannons from government storage, some from the Revolutionary War. He had the cannons sent to a local foundry to be melted down. The foundry kept some of the iron as payment, and the remainder was cast into 9-foot palings, formed as pikes and spearheads which were then sunk into a red sandstone base.

===Early 20th century===

During the Spanish–American War, it was recognized that the Spanish Mauser Model 1893, exhibited characteristics superior to the &quot;trapdoor&quot; Springfield and Krag–Jørgensen rifles carried by the United States troops. On August 15, 1900, Springfield Armory completed an experimental magazine rifle which they believed to be an improvement over the Krag. They fashioned a clip loading magazine rifle in which the cartridges were contained within the stock, preventing damage to an otherwise exposed magazine. It was approved for production in as the Model 1903. Mauser later sued for patent infringement and won royalties from Springfield.

By the time that the United States entered World War I, approximately 843,239 standard service Model 1903 rifles had been manufactured. However, this was insufficient to arm U.S. troops for an undertaking of the magnitude of World War I. During the war Springfield Armory produced over 265,620 Model 1903 rifles. In addition, the War Department contracted for production of the M1917 Enfield Rifle to help aid American troops. These, along with the additional 47,251 rifles produced by the Rock Island Arsenal and the weapons already in service, were enough to supply the war effort. During World War I the Springfield Armory produced ≈25,000 M1911 pistols before all facilities were dedicated to production of M1903 rifles.

In 1919, when John Garand was 31, he came to Springfield, where he worked to develop a semi-automatic rifle. Over the next five years many designs were submitted for the rifle, but none met the army&#x27;s rigid specifications. In 1924, Garand offered a design that was approved for further testing. This was the famous M1, or &quot;Garand rifle&quot; as it came to be known. The army adopted the rifle in 1936, and production began the next year. This began what was to become the greatest production effort in the armory&#x27;s history: during the entire production history of the M1 rifle, the Springfield Armory produced over 4.5 million of them.

The M1&#x27;s accuracy and durability in battle earned it high praise. General Douglas MacArthur reported on the M1 to the Ordnance Department during heavy fighting on Bataan that &quot;Under combat conditions it operated with no mechanical defects and when used in foxholes did not develop stoppages from dust or dirt. It has been in almost constant action for as much as a week without cleaning or lubrication.&quot; Further testament to the M1s role in combat was given by another well-respected military officer, General George S. Patton, Jr., who reported to the Army Ordnance Department on January 26, 1945, &quot;In my opinion, the M1 Rifle is the greatest battle implement ever devised.&quot;

===Late 20th century===
The last small arm developed by the Armory was the M14 rifle, which was, essentially, a highly modified version of the M1 Garand. The M14 was produced from 1959 to 1964 and was the U.S. Army&#x27;s primary combat rifle until being replaced by the M16 rifle gradually from 1964 to 1970. The M14 has evolved over the years into a more modern sniper rifle—the M21.

By the time the U.S. was involved in the Vietnam War, Springfield Armory developed not only rifles but machine guns for ground and air use, grenade launchers, and associated equipment. Many weapons were not manufactured at the Armory, but plans and specifications were drawn up for the use of private contractors who built them elsewhere, representing an economic shift toward the American private arms industry.
== Closure and rebirth as a National Historic Site (1968–present) ==

In 1968, the Springfield Armory was closed. Outer portions of the armory were sold off, including the &quot;Water Shops&quot; production facilities, which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Water Shops Armory. The core site was preserved and the property was turned over to the city and state.

It is now the Springfield Armory National Historic Site, and is managed and operated by the National Park Service. As of 2011, the 35 acres behind the Springfield Armory (and several of its former buildings) housed Springfield Technical Community College (STCC). STCC is the only &quot;technical&quot; community college in Massachusetts, which aims to continue the legacy of technological innovation at the Springfield Armory site.

The Main Arsenal Building and the Commanding Officer&#x27;s Quarters were extensively renovated by Eastern General Contractors of Springfield, Massachusetts between 1987 and 1991. The Main Arsenal now houses the Springfield Armory Museum, which includes the Benton Small Arms Collection, one of the largest collections of weaponry.

==Use of the name &quot;Springfield Armory&quot;==
Following the closure of the U.S. Army Springfield Armory in 1968, the L. H. Gun Co. of Devine, Texas, was renamed Springfield Armory, Inc. to capitalize on the name recognition. There is no affiliation or licensing between the original Springfield Armory and Springfield Armory, Inc., despite a timeline on the commercial website of the latter that includes the history of the former. The company&#x27;s products include M1911 pistols and the M1A rifle series.

<doc id="558007" wikidata="Q826766" url="?curid=558007" title="Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet (21 June 1784 – 19 September 1854) was a British colonial administrator who was Lieutenant Governor of British Honduras from 1814 to 1822 and of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (present-day Tasmania) from 1824 to 1836. The campaign against Aboriginal Tasmanians, known as the Black War, occurred during this term of office. He later served as Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada from 1838 to 1841, and Governor of Bombay from 1842 to 1846.

==Early life==
George Arthur was born in Plymouth, England. He was the youngest son of John Arthur, from a Cornish family, and his wife, Catherine, daughter of Thomas Cornish. He entered the army in 1804 as an ensign and was promoted lieutenant in June 1805. He served during the Napoleonic Wars, including Sir James Craig&#x27;s expedition to Italy in 1806. In 1807 he went to Egypt, and was severely wounded in the attack upon Rosetta. He recuperated and was promoted to captain under Sir James Kempt in Sicily in 1808, and participated in the Walcheren expedition in 1809.

==Family==

Major George Arthur married Eliza Orde Ussher, daughter of Lieut.-Gen. Sir John Sigismund Smith, K.C.B., in May 1814. Lady Arthur lived in Toronto, Ontario 1838–41 with three of the couple&#x27;s sons and their five daughters. She died in London, England, 14 January 1855. Their daughter Catherine married Sir Henry Bartle Frere after he had been her father&#x27;s personal secretary for two years in Bombay, and gave birth to the poet Mary Frere. Their son John married Aileen Spring Rice, the granddaughter of Lord Monteagle of Brandon.

==Honduras==
In 1814 he was appointed lieutenant governor of British Honduras, holding at the same time the rank of colonel on the staff, thus exercising the military command as well as the civil government.

Arthur fell out with Honduran landowners over the local system of democratically elected magistrates. Pointing out its iniquity, he reported cases of maltreatment of women in slavery that went unpunished. In an 1823 Commons debate, abolitionists cited Arthur&#x27;s 1816 letters describing the maltreatment. However, Arthur had also stated in an 1816 article that, apart from those few cases he had reported, in no part of the world had he seen &quot;the labouring class of people possess anything like the comforts and advantages of the Slave population of Honduras&quot;. Despite opponents mocking Arthur&#x27;s contradictory position, William Wilberforce&#x27;s resolution prevailed and flogging of women in slavery was banned. With this collaboration and success came Wilberforce&#x27;s patronage which was key to Arthur&#x27;s next promotion.

==Van Diemen&#x27;s Land==

In 1823 he was appointed lieutenant governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (later known as Tasmania). He arrived on the ship with his wife and family on 12 May 1824 and took office on 14 May. At the time Van Diemen&#x27;s Land was the main British penal colony and it was separated from New South Wales in 1825. It was during Arthur&#x27;s time in office that Van Diemen&#x27;s Land gained much of its notorious reputation as a harsh penal colony. He selected Port Arthur as the ideal location for a prison settlement, on a peninsula connected by a narrow, easily guarded isthmus, surrounded by shark-infested seas. Arthur&#x27;s predecessors had executed no one in Tasmania as capital punishment was carried out in Sydney. George Arthur executed 260 people in his term of office (some bodies were left hanging for months).

As lieutenant governor, George Arthur is responsible for the repression and persecution of the Aboriginal population in the conflict known as the Black War. Throughout the 1820s Arthur had instituted various measures to protect settlers from Aboriginal attacks, including the stationing of garrison troops in remote farmhouses and the dispatch of combined military and police teams into the wilderness to track Indigenous bands. These proved ineffective, and by 1830 the conflict between Aborigines and settlers had increased.

Arthur&#x27;s initial brief had stated, &quot;when such disturbances cannot be prevented or allayed by less vigorous measures, to oppose force by force, and to repel such Aggressions in the same manner, as if they proceeded from subjects of any accredited State.&quot; However, on 17 April 1828 in an official dispatch, Arthur described Aboriginal combatants as &quot;Savages&quot;, a nomenclature that placed them outside the conventions of European warfare.

In February 1830 Arthur sought public input on alternative measures to end the fighting; suggestions included a system of rewards for captured Aborigines, and the importation of packs of hunting dogs to &quot;set [on] the natives as they would a quail.&quot; Arthur himself expressed regret that a treaty was not signed with Aborigines when the colony was established. In its absence, and given the increasing attacks on both sides, on 27 August 1830 Arthur obtained Executive Council approval for a declaration of martial law.

The centrepiece of Arthur&#x27;s military efforts would be the Black Line fiasco, which was intended to drive the Aborigines from the colony&#x27;s grazing land onto isolated peninsulas where they could be controlled. At the beginning of the Black War in 1826 Arthur issued an official statement setting out those situations that would justify settlers using violence: &#x27;If it should be apparent that there is a determination on the part of one or more of the native tribes to attack, rob, or murder the white inhabitants generally, any person may arm, and joining themselves to the military, drive them by force to a safe distance, treating them as open enemies.

In 1833, Arthur wrote to his line superior, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Viscount Goderich, &quot;I am willing to make almost any prudent sacrifice that may tend to compensate for the injuries that the government is unwillingly and unavoidably made the instrument of inflicting.&quot; However, Arthur was a fastidious administrator who once wrote to his son &quot;As to chance and good luck I know of nothing more absurd&quot;. &quot;All happens under the direction of providence of the Almighty who works by human agency&quot;. To the first Aboriginal Establishment (internment camp) on Bruny Island, Arthur initially sent used blankets without any instruction to laund them and a syphilitic assistant overseer. When mortality there skyrocketed, Arthur became concerned. However, his concern appears to have been for the perception of his Abolitionist patrons and the home government regarding deaths of women and children in custody rather than for the tragedy of the Aboriginal Tasmanians&#x27; lives lost. Arthur obfuscated the mortality and distanced himself by setting up a committee. At the Aboriginal Establishment&#x27;s subsequent locations, the litany of pernicious mortality-driving failings continued while Arthur, the Committee and the overseers ignore the everyday prophylactic protocols implemented on convict transports, in prisons and barracks. The failings are in every aspect remarkably reminiscent of the contagion-driving factors documented in an 1811 Parliamentary Paper on the 1809 Walcheren Debacle that Arthur most probably read. A split command hobbled the expeditionary force which became figuratively and literally bogged down. Lacking necessary supplies, accommodation and medical care, mortality due to contagion rose to 10%. Arthur served and fell ill at Walcheren. After the evacuation, he become Aide-de-camp and close friend to General George Don who had initially reconnoitered Walcheren and was then brought in to organize the evacuation. The Parliamentary Paper cited around 50 of Don&#x27;s dispatches. At its various subsequent locations, the Aboriginal Establishment&#x27;s mortality rate averaged just over 10%, while every other institution under Arthur was a paragon of well-managed efficiency with mortality rates below England&#x27;s average of 1.9%.

A &quot;Sydney Monitor&quot; editorial on his recall stated, &quot;[Arthur] gave plausible replies, while he smiled in secret, knowing that those smiles would be communicated to his satraps and underlings, and that they would increase rather than mitigate this undercurrent of tyranny against the opposers of his government.&quot; The improbable level of failures and this description of his character point to Arthur obfuscating an orchestrated diminution which is consistent with a caution Arthur had received from Goderich&#x27;s predecessor, Sir George Murray, in 1830. Murray – an expert in military intelligence analysis who had served as a lieutenant-governor – wrote, &quot;the adoption of any line of conduct, having for its avowed, or for its secret object, the extinction of the Native race, could not fail to leave an indelible stain upon the character of the British Government.&quot;

Arthur failed in his attempts to reform the colony and the system of penal transportation with Arthur&#x27;s autocratic and authoritarian rule leading to his recall in January 1836. By this time he was one of the wealthiest men in the colony, having totaled £50,000 (in 1839 value) by selling nearly all his landed property. He departed Hobart for England on 30 October 1836, boarding the &quot;Elphinstone&quot; in tears, acclaimed by hundreds of cheering colonists.

==Canada==
In 1837 Arthur was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order (KCH), given the rank of Major General on the staff. In December 1837 he was appointed lieutenant governor of Upper Canada and took office in Toronto from 23 March 1838. From the very start of his administration, he had to deal with the aftermath of the Upper Canada Rebellion and was instrumental in the execution of Peter Matthews (rebel) and Samuel Lount. In the same year, Upper Canada was invaded by a band of American sympathizers, one of a series of attempts to subvert British authority in Upper and Lower Canada. He failed to address the issues of fixing colonial administration from the influence of Family Compact, and was replaced by Lord Durham while the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada sat betimes.

The two colonies were united in 1841. The Lord Sydenham, the first governor-general, asked Sir George Arthur to administer Upper Canada as deputy governor. Arthur agreed, on condition that the service was unpaid. Later in 1841 he returned to England and was created a hereditary baronet in recognition of his services in Canada.

==India==
On 8 June 1842, he was appointed governor of the Indian presidency of Bombay, which he retained until 1846. He displayed great tact in the office, as well as ability, and this helped in extending and strengthening British rule in India.

He was appointed provisional governor-general, but did not assume office, as he was compelled by ill health to leave India before Lord Hardinge vacated the governor-generalship.

Sir George Arthur, during his administration of the affairs of the presidency, perfected the Deccan survey, the object of which was to equalise and decrease the pressure of the land assessment on the cultivators of the Deccan; and gave his hearty support to the project of a railway line from Bombay to Cailian, which may be regarded as the germ of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, while during his administration the reclamation of the foreshore of the island of Bombay was projected. During his tenure, he inaugurated the famous &#x27;Grant Medical College&#x27; in Bombay (1845 AD) one of the first three Medical Colleges in India teaching the western medical sciences. The other two being, the Medical College, Bengal (1835 AD) and Madras Medical College (Formerly Madras Medical School in 1835 and later, Madras Medical College in 1850 AD). The hospital for the Grant Medical College, the Jamshedji Jijiboy Hospital was constructed by the Parsee Trust beforehand.

==Final years==
On his return to England in 1846, he was made a privy councillor, and in 1853 he received the colonelcy of the 50th (Queen&#x27;s Own) Regiment of Foot. He was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1854 and died that September.

==Legacy==
Famous Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai is named after Arthur Road which was named after Sir George Arthur, Governor of Bombay

Arthur&#x27;s time in Tasmania was dramatised in the 1945 radio play &quot;Conflict in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot;.

<text>Toner is a powder mixture used in laser printers and photocopiers to form the text and images on paper, in general through a toner cartridge. Mostly granulated plastic, early mixtures added only carbon powder and iron oxide; now there are mixtures that contain polypropylene, fumed silica, and various minerals for triboelectrification. Toner using plant-derived plastic also exists as an alternative to petroleum plastic. Toner particles are melted by the heat of the fuser, and are thus bonded to the paper.

In earlier photocopiers, this low-cost carbon toner was poured by the user from a bottle into a reservoir in the machine. Later copiers, and laser printers from the first 1984 Hewlett-Packard LaserJet, feed directly from a sealed toner cartridge.

Laser toner cartridges for use in color copiers and printers come in sets of cyan, magenta, yellow and black (CMYK), allowing a very large color gamut to be generated by mixing.

== Composition, size and manufacture ==
The specific polymer used varies by manufacturer but can be a styrene acrylate copolymer, a polyester resin, a styrene butadiene copolymer, or a few other special polymers. Toner formulations vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from machine to machine. Typically formulation, granule size and melting point vary the most.

Originally, the particle size of toner averaged 14–16 micrometres or greater. Theoretically, for the perfect reproduction of dots and print features at 600 dpi, a particle size of about 5 μm is required and, at 1200 dpi, about 3 μm is required. Further reductions in particle size producing further improvements in resolution are being developed through the application of new technologies such as Emulsion-Aggregation. Toner manufacturers maintain a quality control standard for particle size distribution in order to produce a powder suitable for use in their printers.

Toner has traditionally been made by compounding the ingredients and creating a slab which was broken or pelletized, then turned into a fine powder with a controlled particle size range by air jet milling. This process results in toner granules with varying sizes and aspherical shapes. To get a finer print, some companies are using a chemical process to grow toner particles from molecular reagents. This results in more uniform size and shapes of toner particles. The smaller, uniform shapes permit more accurate colour reproduction and more efficient toner use.

== Clean-up ==
Toner can be washed off skin and garments with cold water. Hot or warm water softens the toner, causing it to bond in place. Toner fused to skin eventually wears off, or can be partially removed using an abrasive hand cleaner. Toner fused to clothing usually cannot be removed. Unfused toner is easily cleaned from most water-washable clothing. Because toner is a wax or plastic powder with a low melting temperature it must be kept cold while cleaning.

Toner particles have electrostatic properties by design and can develop static-electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and vacuum cleaner hoses. Because of this and the small particle size, toner should not be vacuumed with a conventional home vacuum cleaner. Static discharge from charged toner particles theoretically may ignite dust in the vacuum cleaner bag or create a small explosion if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by household vacuum cleaner filter bags and can blow through the vacuum motor into the room. They can also cause overheating by clogging the motor filter and short circuit by their electric conductivity (carbon, iron) when they melt inside the motor.

If toner spills into the laser printer or photocopier, a special type of vacuum cleaner with an electrically conductive hose and a high efficiency (HEPA) filter may be needed for effective cleaning. These are called electrostatic discharge-safe (ESD-safe) or toner vacuums. Similar HEPA-filter equipped vacuums should be used for clean-up of larger toner spills.

== Health risks ==
Muhle et al. (1991) reported that the responses to chronically inhaled copying toner, a plastic dust pigmented with carbon black, titanium dioxide and silica, were also similar qualitatively to titanium dioxide and diesel exhaust.

Carbon black, one of the components of toner, is classified as &quot;possibly carcinogenic&quot; (Group 2B) by the IARC.

As a fine powder, toner can remain suspended in the air for some period, and is considered to have health effects comparable to inert dust. It can be an irritant to people with respiratory conditions such as asthma or bronchitis. Following studies on bacteria in the 1970s that raised concerns about health effects resulting from pyrrole, a contaminant created during manufacture of the carbon black used in black toner, manufacturing processes were changed to eliminate pyrrole from the finished product.

Research by the Queensland University of Technology has indicated that some laser printers emit submicrometer particles which have been associated in other environmental studies with respiratory diseases.

A study at the University of Rostock has found that the microscopic particles in toner are carcinogenic, similar to asbestos. Several technicians who had been working with printers and copiers on a daily basis were observed for several years. They showed increased lung problems. This confirms previous research published in 2006.

Research at Harvard University has shown that, during printing, metal-oxide nanoparticles (defined as 100 nanometres and smaller, hence 0.1 micrometres and smaller) are released into the air from toner-based laser printers and multifunction devices. These machines use toner particles that are on average 20 micrometres in overall diameter, but the surfaces of the toner particles themselves carry innumerable tiny metal-oxide nanoparticles. These ultra-small metal-oxide nanoparticles are highly bioactive and could cause harm to the lungs and also elsewhere in the body, given that particles 0.1 micrometres and smaller can cross biological membranes (including lung alveoli), thereby gaining access to all organs via blood circulation. This remains an area of active research, with many knowledge gaps.

== Packaging ==

The toner container can be a simple pack, for toner storage and transportation, or further, a consumable component of the printer.
The most common way to consume toner is with a toner cartridge (or &quot;laser toner&quot;), 
as an office supply of a laser printer or photocopier.

=== Repackaging ===
Several toner manufacturers offer toner in wholesale quantities. Typically, bulk loose toner is sold in barrels or 10 kg (22-pound) bags.

Toner is then used by a variety of industries in order to provide consumers with a finished laser toner cartridge.

Original Equipment manufacturers such as HP and Canon as well as manufacturers of compatible toner cartridges use the toner in the process of manufacturing a brand new OEM cartridge.
Remanufacturers of toner cartridges use the bulk toner in the process of creating remanufactured toner cartridges. Other companies use the toner to provide a toner refill service.

Most toner cartridges are available to the average consumer through retail outlets or local remanufacturing operations. Remanufactured and refilled toner cartridges are generally offered at a lower cost than original toner cartridges, having been either wholly remanufactured and then refilled with toner (the more-optimal method) or just refilled with toner (the less-optimal method).

== Environmental considerations ==
Recycling of pre-consumer waste toner is practiced by most manufacturers. Classifying toner to the desired size distribution produces off-size rejects, but these become valuable feedstocks for the compounding operation, and are recycled this way. Post-consumer waste toner appears primarily in the cleaning operation of the photo-printing machine. In early printers, as much as 20 to 25% of feed toner would wind up in the cleaner sump and be discarded as waste. Improved printer efficiencies have reduced this waste stream to lower levels, although on average 13% of the toner in each cartridge is still wasted. Some printer designs have attempted to divert this waste toner back into the virgin toner reservoir for direct reuse in the printer; these attempts have met with mixed success as the composition of the toner will change by expending fusibles while retaining developer particles. Some consideration and fewer industry attempts have been made to reclaim waste toner by cleaning it and &quot;remanufacturing&quot; it.

Most toner goes to printed pages, a large fraction of which are ultimately recycled in paper recovery and recycling operations. Removal of toner from the pulp is not easy, and toner formulations to ease this step have been reported. Hydrolyzable, water-soluble, and caustic-soluble toner resins have been reported, but do not appear to enjoy widespread application. Most paper recycling facilities mix toner with other waste material, such as inks and resins, into a sludge with no commercial use.

== Toner-modified asphalt binder ==
Since toner consists of several copolymers and it is a carbon-based material, it can be used as a useful modifier for the asphalt industry. It has been shown that inclusion of left-over burnt toner enhances the rheological and mechanical properties of asphalt binder, significantly. Such an application can be placed as an environmentally friendly alternative to prevent soil contamination due to the landfilling of waste toner. Adding waste toner into asphalt binder and mixture decreases the binder&#x27;s glass transition temperature and also, in the meantime increase the crystallization temperature as well.

<doc id="558014" wikidata="Q2449692" url="?curid=558014" title="Breton lai">
<text>A Breton lai, also known as a narrative lay or simply a lay, is a form of medieval French and English romance literature. Lais are short (typically 600–1000 lines), rhymed tales of love and chivalry, often involving supernatural and fairy-world Celtic motifs. The word &quot;lay&quot; or &quot;lai&quot; is thought to be derived from the Old High German and/or Old Middle German &quot;leich&quot;, which means play, melody, or song, or as suggested by Jack Zipes in &quot;The Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales&quot;, the Irish word &quot;laid&quot; (song).

Zipes writes that Arthurian legends may have been brought from Wales, Cornwall and Ireland to Brittany; on the continent the songs were performed in various places by harpists, minstrels, storytellers. Zipes reports the earliest recorded lay is Robert Biker&#x27;s Lai du Cor, dating to the mid- to late-12th century.

The earliest of the Breton lais to survive is probably &quot;The Lais of Marie de France&quot;, thought to have been composed in the 1170s by Marie de France, a French poet writing in England at Henry II&#x27;s court between the late 12th and early 13th centuries. From descriptions in Marie&#x27;s lais, and in several anonymous Old French lais of the 13th century, we know of earlier lais of Celtic origin, perhaps more lyrical in style, sung by Breton minstrels. It is believed that these Breton lyrical lais, none of which has survived, were introduced by a summary narrative setting the scene for a song, and that these summaries became the basis for the narrative lais.

The earliest written Breton lais were composed in a variety of Old French dialects, and some half dozen lais are known to have been composed in Middle English in the 13th and 14th centuries by various English authors.

Breton lais may have inspired Chrétien de Troyes, and likely were responsible for spreading Celtic and fairy-lore into Continental Europe. An example of a 14th-century Breton lai has the king of the fairies carrying away a wife to the land of fairy.

==Old French Lais==
* &quot;The Lais of Marie de France&quot; — twelve canonical lais generally accepted as those of Marie de France.
* The so-called Anonymous Lais — eleven lais of disputed authorship. While these lais are occasionally interspersed with the Marian lais in Medieval manuscripts, scholars do not agree that these lais were actually written by Marie.
* Several lais are known only in Old Norse translation, translated into Old Norwegian prose in the thirteenth century, where they were known as the &quot;Strengleikar&quot;. These are &quot;Guruns ljóð&quot;, &quot;Ricar hinn gamli&quot;, &quot;Tveggia elskanda strengleikr&quot;, and &quot;Strandarljóð&quot; (the &#x27;Lay of the Beach&#x27;, composed by &#x27;the Red Lady of Brittany&#x27;, the surviving account of which gives a detailed description of William the Conqueror&#x27;s commissioning of what appears to be a lyric lai to commemorate a period spent at Barfleur).

==Middle English Lais==
*&#x27;Sir Orfeo&#x27;, &#x27;Sir Degaré&#x27;, &#x27;Sir Gowther&#x27;, &#x27;Emaré&#x27; and &#x27;The Erle of Toulouse&#x27;, all by anonymous authors
*&#x27;Lay le Freine&#x27;, a translation of Marie de France&#x27;s &#x27;Le Fresne&#x27;
*&#x27;The Franklin&#x27;s Tale&#x27; from the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer. The Franklin describes his tale thus:
::Thise olde gentil Bretouns in hir dayes
::Of diverse aventures maden layes,
::Rymeyed in hir firste Briton tonge;
::Which layes with hir instrumentz they songe,
::Or elles redden hem for hir plesaunce.
*&#x27;Sir Launfal&#x27;, by Thomas Chestre (a retelling of an earlier Middle English lai, &#x27;Landavale&#x27;, itself a translation of Marie de France&#x27;s &#x27;Lanval&#x27;)

<text>Sir Loyd Daniel Gilman Grossman (born 16 September 1950) is an American-British author, broadcaster, musician, businessman and cultural campaigner who has mainly worked in the United Kingdom. He presented the BBC programme &quot;MasterChef&quot; from 1990 to 2000 and was a co-presenter, with David Frost, of the BBC and ITV panel show &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; from 1987 until 2003.

== Early life and education ==
Grossman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on 16 September 1950 and raised in Marblehead, Massachusetts, the son of David K. Grossman, a Jewish antique dealer and Helen Katherine (née Gilman). Many members of his father&#x27;s family were art and antiques dealers in and around Boston. His cousin was Ram Dass, the spiritual teacher and author. His initial education was at the General John Glover School in Marblehead, and then at Marblehead High School. He graduated from Boston University with a BA degree &quot;cum laude&quot; in history in 1972. In 1975, he travelled to the United Kingdom to study at the London School of Economics, where he earned an MSc degree in economic history in 1977. Grossman later returned to university at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he studied history of art, receiving in this subject an MPhil degree in 2009 and a PhD in 2014.

== Career ==

===Journalism===
Grossman became involved with journalism as an undergraduate in Boston writing for a number of &#x27;underground&#x27; and music publications including &quot;Boston After Dark&quot;, &quot;Fusion&quot;, &quot;Vibrations&quot;, the &quot;New York Review of Rock&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. After graduation from the LSE he joined the staff of &quot;Harpers &amp; Queen&quot; as design editor and subsequently went to work for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as contributing editor. He has written for many British newspapers and is a regular contributor to &quot;Country Life&quot;. While at &quot;Harpers &amp; Queen&quot; he was also the magazine&#x27;s restaurant critic, a pursuit which he continued for thirteen years also writing about restaurants for &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

===Television===
Grossman&#x27;s television career began in 1983 as one of the regular faces on TV-am presenting among other things a short segment, &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot;, which he devised along with Kevin Sim and David Frost. &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; transferred to primetime on ITV in 1987 and Grossman continued on the show until 2003. He presented &quot;Masterchef&quot; from 1990 to 2000 and &quot;Junior Masterchef&quot; as well as a great number of other programmes including &quot;Loyd on Location&quot;, &quot;The History of British Sculpture&quot;, and &quot;Behind the Headlines&quot;. He also presented the BBC Radio 3 series &quot;Composers at Home&quot;.

===Music===

Grossman has a continuing career as a guitarist initially with punk band Jet Bronx And The Forbidden, who reached number 47 in the UK singles chart in December 1977 with &quot;Ain&#x27;t Doin&#x27; Nothing&quot;. He returned to playing music in 2008 at the Vienna Rebellion Punk Festival. He subsequently formed a new band, The New Forbidden, with Valentine Guinness. The New Forbidden have appeared at Glastonbury eight times. Grossman also appears as a guest artist with Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull when they play their annual concerts in aid of English cathedrals.

===Food===
In 1995, Grossman introduced his own brand of cooking sauces, which a 2003 survey found to be the most successful UK celebrity brand. The sauces are produced by arrangement with Premier Foods.

In 2000, he was asked to head a project to improve the quality of food served in British NHS hospitals. Although some newspapers reported that the project had a £40 million budget, Grossman pointed out in a &quot;Nursing Times&quot; interview that almost all of that money was earmarked for the ward housekeeping programme. He was disappointed that there seemed to be little real money or political will to change hospital catering.

===Heritage and the arts===
Grossman&#x27;s lifelong interest in history, the arts and heritage has involved him in a number of organisations. He is a former commissioner of the Museums and Galleries Commission, a former commissioner of English Heritage (where he was chairman of the Museums Advisory Committee and the Blue Plaques Panel), and of the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England. He was a founding member of the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, past chairman of the National Museums Liverpool, deputy chairman of Liverpool European Capital of Culture, chairman of Culture Northwest and of the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association. He founded the 24 Hour Museum (now Culture24).

He was chairman of the University for the Creative Arts from 2008 to 2012 and a member of the Court of Governors of the LSE from 1996 to 2009 and is now an emeritus governor. He was deputy chair of the Royal Drawing School, a member of the Council of the British School at Rome, a member of the board of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions and a governor of the Building Crafts College. Grossman was chairman of the Churches Conservation Trust from 2007 to 2016 and in 2009 became chairman of the Heritage Alliance – the UK organisation that represents more than 100 leading non-governmental organisations across the heritage sector. In 2015, he was elected for an unprecedented third term as chairman. In 2016, he was appointed chairman of The Royal Parks.

===Current appointments===

Grossman is chairman of The Royal Parks, having been reappointed for a four-year term in July 2020, to run from 5 July 2020 to 4 July 2024. He is also chairman of Gresham College, a governor of the British Institute at Florence, a governor of the Compton Verney House Trust and a trustee of the Warburg Charitable Trust. He is president of the Arts Society (formerly NADFAS) and patron of the Association for Heritage Interpretation.

===Other activities===
Grossman is Master of the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, an Honorary Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Past Master of the Worshipful Company of Arts Scholars. He is a fellow of a number of learned societies: the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Historical Society, the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland and the Royal Society of Medicine. Lloyd is also a season ticket holder at Goodison, Everton FC&#x27;s ground.

== Personal life ==
Grossman was married to Deborah Puttnam, the daughter of the film producer David Puttnam, from 1985 to 2004 and they have two daughters. In 2024, he married secondly the actress Melissa (Clare) Knatchbull (née Owen), daughter of High Court judge Sir John Owen and former wife of Michael Knatchbull, son of the Academy Award-nominated television and film producer John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne. He is a keen scuba diver and a lifelong fan of the Boston Red Sox.

His Anglo-American accent reflects his Boston origins and has frequently been the subject of parody including in adverts for his own sauces.

<text>SimPay was a consortium which was founded to promote mobile payment in 2003 but which was closed as of June 2005. Simpay started in Spain by a number of mobile phone companies to build an open, interoperable solution, but was abandoned when key members pulled out in 2005.

==History==
In February 2003, T-Mobile, Orange, Telefónica and Vodafone formed a new Mobile Payment Services Association (MPSA) with the goal to deliver an open, interoperable and commonly branded solution for payments via mobile phones, designed to work across all operator networks. In June 2003 the consortium re-branded itself as SimPay.

In February 2005, Amena and Proximus joined the consortium.

Simpay planned to create a pan-European framework whereby merchants and content resellers would be able to charge for products and services directly to a subscriber&#x27;s bill.

In June 2005, Simpay decided, &quot;following the decision of one of its founding Members not to launch Simpay for the foreseeable future, [...] not to pursue its activity on a pan-European scale as originally planned.&quot; All activities were put on hold effective June 24, 2005.

The UK Simpay founders started work in 2005 on a project called &quot;Payforit&quot; which was launched in 2007 to provide similar services in the UK.

<doc id="558045" wikidata="Q4992109" url="?curid=558045" title="Francie Calfo">
<text>Francine &quot;Francie&quot; Calfo is a fictional character on the television series &quot;Alias,&quot; portrayed by Merrin Dungey from 2001 to 2003 and again in 2006. Initially the best friend of lead character Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner), Francie is murdered by a lookalike assassin named Allison Doren, who assumes her identity.

==Character overview==
As the series begins in the 2001 pilot episode &quot;Truth Be Told&quot;, Francie is Sydney Bristow&#x27;s best friend and roommate. Sydney is a covert agent for a black ops division of the CIA called SD-6, a fact she struggles to hide from her friends. Francie acts as an occasional sounding board and confidante for some of Sydney&#x27;s personal issues, and eventually decides to open a restaurant. Francie and her friend Will Tippin realize their attraction to each other, and decide to start a relationship.

Sydney, having learned that SD-6 is not a sanctioned CIA division but is in fact a covert cell of a transnational organized crime syndicate, manages to destroy the entire organization in the Season 2 episode &quot;Phase One&quot; (2003). In the same episode, a genetic doppelgänger named Allison Doren kills Francie and assumes her identity. Under orders from Arvin Sloane, Allison bugs Sydney&#x27;s apartment, hypnotically interrogates Will, plants eavesdropping devices on Michael Vaughn and murders Marcus Dixon&#x27;s wife. Eventually Will, and then Sydney, realize in the 2003 episode &quot;The Telling&quot; that &quot;Francie&quot; is an impostor, and after a brutal battle Sydney shoots Allison to death.
Allison later reappears very much alive in the 2003 episode &quot;The Nemesis&quot;, in which she is shot by Sydney and then stabbed to death by Will.

Francie herself appears in a brief flashback in the 2006 series finale &quot;All the Time in the World&quot;, in which Sydney is shown to have met her first fiancé, Danny Hecht, through Francie and her boyfriend.

==Development==
The character was named after Francie Calfo, the real-life vice president of drama development at Touchstone Television who shepherded &quot;Alias&quot; to series.

With Francie not involved in the &quot;secret agent&quot; plot lines of the series, the character was &quot;pushed to the sidelines&quot; just as Lena Olin was introduced as Sydney&#x27;s mother Irina Derevko late in Season 1. Clued in by &quot;Alias&quot; creator and executive producer J. J. Abrams in October 2002 to the &quot;switch&quot; of her character, Dungey and Abrams discussed different ways to facilitate it. Dungey began secretly training with world champion kickboxer Benny &quot;the Jet&quot; Urquidez to prepare for the physicality of her new role. She quipped, &quot;Jennifer [Garner] is a badass ... And if I&#x27;m going to have to get in there and tangle with her or any one of her fellow foes on the show, I&#x27;ve got to be ready.&quot;

Francie is murdered and Allison is introduced in &quot;Phase One&quot;, which aired after Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003. Following the broadcast, Dungey noted that &quot;Bad Francie&quot; would continue playing the part of Sydney&#x27;s friend for the purpose of espionage. She noted, &quot;Even though some of the situations seem to be similar — me and Sydney in the house talking — you know Bad Francie is up to no good ... It&#x27;s sooo good now. It is just delicious every time I get to jump into &#x27;the Francinator.&#x27;&quot;

The events of &quot;Phase One&quot; initiated a &quot;reboot&quot; of sorts for the series, with the end of the SD-6 double agent storyline as well as Sydney&#x27;s need to hide her profession from her friends (Will discovers the truth and Francie is now known to be dead).

Allison-as-Francie was repeatedly referred to as &quot;Bad Francie&quot; or &quot;Evil Francie&quot; by fans and the press.

==Plotlines==
===Allison Doren===
At the end of the second season, Will discovers Allison is not Francie. He attempts to warn Sydney by leaving a frantic voicemail message on her phone, when he is suddenly attacked by Allison, who attempts to strangle him. After failing to kill him, Will corners her with a knife and demands, &quot;It&#x27;s always been you? Allison?&quot; Allison expresses remorse at what was happening, as she had apparently developed feelings for him during the months she spent posing as Francie. Allison knocks the knife away from Will, takes it, and stabs him with it. She hides Will&#x27;s body in the bathtub shortly before Sydney arrives home.

Once home, Sydney relaxes on the couch beside Allison, checking her voicemail. She receives Will&#x27;s message and manages to retain her composure, casually offering Allison ice cream, which Allison accepts. Sydney then excuses herself, hastily making her way to her bedroom to get a weapon, somehow realizing Will was right and &quot;Francie&quot; was a double. Allison appears in the doorway and reveals her mistake, &quot;I just remembered. Francie doesn&#x27;t like coffee ice cream,&quot; to which Sydney replies, &quot;No, she doesn&#x27;t.&quot;

The two engage in a desperate, brutal fight throughout the house during which most of the furniture and possessions are either used as weapons or destroyed. During the fight, Sydney finds Will&#x27;s body in the bathroom, although she later learns he survived Allison&#x27;s attack. The fight ends when Sydney manages to shoot Allison three times, once in the arm and twice in the chest.

Despite apparently dying, Allison is recovered by the Covenant and nursed back to health, turning up in the third season. Sydney confronts her in Sofia and shoots her. Allison heals rapidly and escapes from an ambulance transporting her to a hospital. Later, Will finds and confronts her, stabbing and killing her, in exactly the same manner as she had once stabbed him.

<text>Pu Songling (, 5 June 1640 – 25 February 1715) was a Chinese writer during the Qing dynasty, best known as the author of &quot;Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio&quot; (&quot;Liaozhai zhiyi&quot;).

==Biography==
Pu was born into a poor merchant family from Zichuan (淄川, in Zibo, Shandong). At the age of 18, he received the Xiucai degree in the Imperial examination. It was not until he was 71 that he was awarded the &quot;Gongsheng&quot; (&quot;tribute student&quot;) degree for his achievement in literature rather than for passing the Imperial exam.

He spent most of his life working as a private tutor, collecting stories that were later published in &quot;Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio&quot; in 1740. Some critics attribute the Vernacular Chinese novel &quot;Xingshi Yinyuan Zhuan&quot; (&quot;Marriage Destinies to Awaken the World&quot;) to him.

== In popular culture ==
In &quot;The Knight of Shadows: Between Yin and Yang&quot; (2019), Jackie Chan portrays Pu Songling.

Dao Lang has released an album based on his folk stories, called &quot;There are Few Folk Songs&quot; (山歌寥哉). The tracklist includes &quot;Luosha Haishi&quot; (罗刹海市), a song based on The Raksha Country and the Sea Market, which is compared to &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; for its virality and watching records.

<text>Roy Castle (31 August 1932 – 2 September 1994) was an English dancer, singer, comedian, actor, television presenter and musician. In addition to being an accomplished jazz trumpet player, he could play many other instruments. Following a versatile career as a performer on stage, television and film, he became best known to British television viewers as the long-running presenter of the children&#x27;s series &quot;Record Breakers&quot;.

==Early career==
Castle was born in Scholes, near Holmfirth, West Riding of Yorkshire. The son of a railwayman, he was a tap dancer from an early age and trained at Nora Bray&#x27;s school of dance with Audrey Spencer who later ran a big dance school, and after leaving Holme Valley Grammar School (now Honley High School) he started his career as an entertainer in an amateur concert party. As a young performer in the 1950s, he lived in Cleveleys near Blackpool and appeared there at the local Queen&#x27;s Theatre, turning professional in 1953 as a stooge for Jimmy Clitheroe and Jimmy James. By 1958, he was appearing at the Royal Variety Show where he was invited to appear on the Royal Command Performance (1958) and received wide acclaim, being hailed as the hit of the show. This was also where he met lifelong friend, Harry Secombe, with whom he went on to work on numerous occasions 

As a singer, he released one charting single in 1960, the Christmas song &quot;Little White Berry&quot;.

==Television and film career==
Castle guest-starred in an episode of the Morecambe and Wise series &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;, which aired on 3 August 1963. He received billing twice for his guest appearances in both halves of the show. In 1965, Castle starred with Peter Cushing in the film &quot;Dr. Who and the Daleks&quot;, the first of two cinematic spin-offs from the BBC television series. He played the role of Dr. Who&#x27;s first male assistant, Ian Chesterton, and was cast to perform the role more comedically than it had been played by William Russell in the equivalent serial. He appeared in &quot;Dr. Terror&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; as a jazz musician.

Castle also appeared in &quot;Carry On Up the Khyber&quot; in 1968 and in the TV musical &quot;Pickwick&quot; for the BBC in 1969. In the 1990s, he appeared again in &quot;Pickwick&quot;, touring the country, starring alongside Sir Harry Secombe, and the show was recorded again. (Secombe had starred in the original West End production in 1963.) In 1973, Castle teamed up with the comedy actor Ronnie Barker in an original one-off called &quot;Another Fine Mess&quot; (an episode from Barker&#x27;s series &quot;Seven of One&quot;). Barker was one of Castle&#x27;s best friends, and paid tribute to their work together shortly after Castle&#x27;s death.

In 1967 and 1968, Castle co-starred with Jimmy Edwards in the London West End run of the comedy farce show &quot;Big Bad Mouse&quot; when Eric Sykes had to withdraw because of illness. The show was resident at the Shaftesbury Theatre and, being loosely scripted, it offered both Edwards and Castle the chance to freely ad-lib and generally break the fourth wall with the audience, Castle breaking into trumpet performances while Edwards walked into a front stall seat to read a newspaper, tap dancing and firing ping-pong balls into the stalls. He also once stood in for Bruce Forsyth hosting &quot;The Generation Game&quot; in 1975 while Forsyth was ill. He made many appearances on BBC television&#x27;s long running variety show &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, making use of his multi instrumental and performing skills. In 1988, Castle presented and performed in the Anglia Television series &quot;Marching as to War&quot;, which traced and re-enacted the early history of The Salvation Army.

===&quot;Record Breakers&quot;===
In 1972, he first presented &quot;Record Breakers&quot;, a children&#x27;s show, and he remained host for over 20 years. He recorded the theme song &quot;Dedication&quot; for the show himself, and usually performed it live over the closing credits. While presenting the show he broke nine world records himself, including:
* Fastest tap-dance 1,440 taps per minute – 24 taps per second, set on 14 January 1973. 
* Longest wing walk – 3 hours, 23 minutes.
* Playing the same tune on 43 different instruments in four minutes.
* On 2 November 1985, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that &quot;Twinkle-toed Roy Castle has the world at his feet...the millionth time in 24 hours. This was the moment when he tap-danced his way to a new record and raised £1 million for charity. The comedian, host of TV&#x27;s &quot;Record Breakers&quot;, averaged nearly twelve steps a second during the sponsored feat in London. Roy, 53, had already qualified as the world&#x27;s fastest tap-dancer.&quot;

He was a host of the show until a few months before his death in 1994, alongside Norris and (until his murder in 1975) Ross McWhirter, Fiona Kennedy and Cheryl Baker. From then on, hosting was taken over by Baker and former athlete Kriss Akabusi. It continued until 2001, making it one of Britain&#x27;s longest-running shows.

==Singing career==
Between 1958 and 1969, Castle recorded three LPs. One of these, &quot;Songs for a Rainy Day&quot; was recorded in 1966 for the Columbia label and was reissued in the UK on CD by EMI Gold, re-titled &quot;Isn&#x27;t This a Lovely Day&quot; in 2005. The record features twelve songs with rain as the theme. British jazz players of the day Gordon Beck (piano), Jeff Clyne (bass), Leon Calvert (flugelhorn), Ike Isaacs (guitar), Ray Swinfield (flute) and Al Newman (saxophone) played on the record and it features jazz arrangements by Victor Graham covering a variety of styles such as big band, (&quot;Pennies From Heaven&quot;, &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;), ballads (&quot;February Brings The Rain&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s That Rainy Day&quot;, &quot;Soon It&#x27;s Gonna Rain&quot;) and bossa novas (&quot;Everytime It Rains&quot;, &quot;The Gentle Rain&quot;).

Castle&#x27;s recording career also included the spoken word. In 1978, for the Scripture Union Label, he recorded eight Bible parables, released on side 1 of the LP &quot;Castle on Luke Street&quot;, (SU0806), from the &#x27;Luke Street&#x27; books, by David Lewis. Side 2 was spoken by Kenneth Williams, Dora Bryan, Derek Nimmo, and Thora Hird, who narrated one story each.

==Personal life==
Castle married dancer Fiona Dickson on 29 July 1963 with Harry Secombe acting as Best Man. They had been introduced to each other by Eric Morecambe Both Castle and his wife were committed Christians and they regularly attended the Baptist church near their home. They had four children. Their youngest son, Ben Castle (born 1973), is a jazz saxophonist who has played with a wide range of artists, including Jamie Cullum, Carleen Anderson, Beth Rowley, Marillion and Radiohead, and performed on film soundtracks.

Castle was a football fan and supported Liverpool. Fewer than six months before his death, he attended the Liverpool–Everton derby match at Anfield on 13 March 1994 and stood on the Spion Kop terrace. He had also been in the crowd at Liverpool&#x27;s FA Cup final victory over Sunderland in May 1992, shortly after he was first found to have cancer. At that time Ronnie Barker paid tribute to him, referring to their portrayal of characters that bore a strong resemblance to Laurel and Hardy in &quot;Another Fine Mess&quot;.

On 31 December 1992, Castle was awarded the OBE in the 1993 New Year Honours.

==Illness and death==
Castle was diagnosed with lung cancer in early 1992, and was told that his chances of recovery were slim and that it was unlikely that he would live for more than six months. He underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy and went into remission later that year. A non-smoker, he blamed his illness on passive smoking during his years of playing the trumpet in smoky jazz clubs. On 26 November 1993, Castle announced that his illness had returned, and underwent a second round of treatment. Over the spring and summer of 1994, in spite of his deteriorating health, he carried out the high-profile &quot;Tour of Hope&quot; to raise funds for the erection of the building that would become the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation, which is the only British charity dedicated solely to defeating lung cancer.

During and shortly after Castle&#x27;s illness, many smoke-free restaurants and cafes were awarded the &quot;Roy Castle Clean Air Award&quot; to denote their adherence to a smoke-free regime (which at that time was voluntary).

His final contribution to &quot;Record Breakers&quot; was aired at the conclusion of the 1993 series, although the programme continued until 2001.

He died at his home in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire on the morning of 2 September 1994, two days after his 62nd birthday. A week before his death he was made a freeman of the City of Liverpool.

His funeral service took place on 8 September 1994 in Amersham. Present at the funeral service along with his family were Sir Harry Secombe, Bruce Forsyth, Cliff Richard, and Sir John Mills. A memorial service at Liverpool Cathedral was held on 20 October 1994.

==Legacy==

His widow Fiona worked with the charity after her husband&#x27;s death, and campaigned for the British smoking ban, which came into effect in Northern Ireland in 2004, Scotland in 2006, and England and Wales in 2007, banning smoking in virtually all enclosed public places.

<doc id="558055" wikidata="Q20100936" url="?curid=558055" title="Act Against Slavery">
<text>The Act Against Slavery was an anti-slavery law passed on July 9, 1793, in the second legislative session of Upper Canada, the colonial division of British North America that would eventually become Ontario. It banned the importation of slaves and mandated that children born henceforth to female slaves would be freed upon reaching the age of 25.

==Synopsis==

John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant Governor of the colony, had been a supporter of abolition before coming to Upper Canada; as a British Member of Parliament, he had described slavery as an offence against Christianity. By 1792 the slave population in Upper Canada was not large. However, when compared with the number of free settlers, the number was not insignificant. In York (the present-day city of Toronto) there were 15 African-Canadians living, while in Quebec some 1,000 slaves could be found. Furthermore, by the time the Act Against Slavery would be ratified, the number of slaves residing in Upper Canada had been significantly increased by the arrival of Loyalist refugees from the south who brought with them servants and slaves.

At the inaugural meeting of the Executive Council of Upper Canada in March 1793, Simcoe heard from a witness the story of Chloe Cooley, a female slave who had been violently removed from Canada for sale in the United States. Simcoe&#x27;s desire to abolish slavery in Upper Canada was resisted by members of the Legislative Assembly who owned slaves, and therefore the resulting act was a compromise. The bulk of the text is due to John White, the Attorney General of the day. Of the 16 members of the assembly, at least six owned slaves.

The law, titled &quot;An Act to Prevent the further Introduction of Slaves and to limit the Term of Contracts for Servitude within this Province&quot;, stated that while all slaves in the province would remain enslaved until death, no new slaves could be brought into Upper Canada, and children born to female slaves after passage of the act would be freed at the age of 25.

This law made Upper Canada &quot;the first jurisdiction in the British Empire to pass a law freeing slaves&quot;. The act remained in force until the British Parliament&#x27;s Slavery Abolition Act 1833 abolished slavery in most parts of the British Empire.

==Aftermath==
In 1798, Christopher Robinson introduced a bill in the Legislative Assembly to allow the importation of additional slaves. The bill was passed by the Assembly, but was stalled by the Legislative Council and died at the end of the session.

Thousands of Black Canadians volunteered to serve in the War of 1812. In 1819, Attorney General John Robinson (son of Christopher) declared that by residing in Canada, black residents were set free, and that Canadian courts would protect their freedom.

<text>Philip Carteret Hill (August 13, 1821 – September 15, 1894) was a Nova Scotia politician. Born in Halifax, he was mayor of Halifax from 1861 to 1864 before entering provincial politics as a supporter of Canadian confederation in 1867 serving as Provincial Secretary in the Conservative cabinet of Hiram Blanchard but lost his seat in the fall 1867 election that defeated the government.

Hill returned to the legislature in 1870 by winning a by-election as a &quot;Liberal-Conservative&quot;. He again lost his seat in 1871 but returned in 1874 and served in the Liberal government of William Annand as provincial secretary. Feelings against confederation had abated and Hill was well placed to put forward a compromise position that enabled him to succeed Annand as premier in 1875. However, Hill took over the Liberal government at a time that the federal Liberals were in power under Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie and becoming increasingly unpopular in Nova Scotia. That, and the failure of the Annand and Hill governments to make progress on railway construction, led to the Liberal&#x27;s defeat in the 1878 election after which Hill retired from politics. He moved to England in 1882 and published a series theological pamphlets. He died in Tunbridge Wells.

<doc id="558058" wikidata="Q182427" url="?curid=558058" title="Stephen Street">
<text>Stephen Brian Street (born 29 March 1960 in Hackney, London) is an English record producer best known for his work with the Smiths, the Cranberries and Blur. Street collaborated with Morrissey on his debut album &quot;Viva Hate&quot; following the split of the Smiths.

More recently he has worked with Kaiser Chiefs, Babyshambles and the Courteeners.

For a time, he was managed by Gail Colson&#x27;s company Gailforce Management.

In February 2020, Street received the award for Outstanding Contribution to UK Music at the Music Producer&#x27;s Guild Awards.

==Career==
===Early career===
Street began his musical career in the late 1970s playing in various bands around London. He played bass in the new wave ska/pop group, Bim, with future Neneh Cherry/Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey. The band were featured in the &quot;Listen to London&quot; documentary film. Street started at Island Records&#x27; Fallout Shelter Studio in 1982 firstly as an &quot;in-house assistant&quot; and then as an &quot;in-house engineer&quot;.

===The Smiths and Morrissey (1984–1989)===
One of Street&#x27;s first jobs as in-house engineer was for a session for the Smiths&#x27;s &quot;Heaven Knows I&#x27;m Miserable Now&quot; and commented in a HitQuarters interview, &quot;I&#x27;d seen them just shortly beforehand on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; doing &quot;This Charming Man&quot;, and like most other people around that time who were into music I was really excited by them.&quot; Although Street didn&#x27;t work on the subsequent recording &quot;William, It Was Really Nothing&quot;, he was asked to engineer their next album, &quot;Meat Is Murder&quot;, with Morrissey and Marr producing for the first time.

During this time, he engineered for reggae artists including Black Uhuru and Linton Kwesi Johnson, and for jùjú musician King Sunny Adé. He helped produce and mix several tracks on Stephen Duffy&#x27;s first two albums: &quot;The Ups and the Downs&quot; in 1985 and &quot;Because We Love You&quot; in 1986. Twelve years later, he worked with Duffy on his 1998 album &quot;I Love My Friends&quot;.

Street continued to work with the Smiths, working as an engineer on their album &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; before assuming a producer role for &quot;Strangeways, Here We Come&quot;, their final album.

After the Smiths broke up, Street was producer and co-songwriter for Morrissey&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Viva Hate&quot;, which reached No. 1, spawning two top 10 hits in the UK. Street and Vini Reilly, guitarist on &quot;Viva Hate&quot;, had a dispute over songwriting credits. Reilly claimed to have written the majority of the tracks on the album, which Street dismissed, claiming that he wrote the music for all of the tracks on the album and that Reilly had no part to play in that. Street was credited as producer, songwriter, guitarist and bass guitarist on the album. Street went on to co-write and produce two further singles for Morrissey which appeared on &quot;Bona Drag&quot; before the singer ended their association, apparently due to disputes regarding royalty payments and alleged conversations between Street and Johnny Rogan, author of controversial Morrissey texts.

===Blur (1990–1997; 2015) and Graham Coxon (2003–2009)===
After hearing &quot;She&#x27;s So High&quot;, Blur&#x27;s first single, Street contacted their manager. Soon after he produced their second single &quot;There&#x27;s No Other Way&quot;, although he did not produce the album as a whole. Street produced Blur&#x27;s next four albums: &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot;, &quot;Parklife&quot;, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; and &quot;Blur&quot;.

Following Graham Coxon&#x27;s departure from Blur, Street produced the guitarist&#x27;s next album &quot;Happiness in Magazines&quot;, released May 2004, plus follow-up albums &quot;Love Travels at Illegal Speeds&quot; in March 2006 and &quot;The Spinning Top&quot; in May 2009.

Street produced Blur&#x27;s 2015 album &quot;The Magic Whip&quot;, their first since the band&#x27;s reformation with Coxon.

===The Cranberries (1992–1994; 2001–2002; 2011–2019)===
In 1992, Street started working with Irish band the Cranberries on their debut album &quot;Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can&#x27;t We?&quot;. The album turned out to be a huge success in the US. In 1994, Street worked with the band again on their second album &quot;No Need to Argue&quot;. Following two albums with different producers, the band worked with Street again on their 2001 album &quot;Wake Up and Smell the Coffee&quot; and the two extra tracks that were recorded for their 2002 best of album &quot;Stars&quot;: &quot;Stars&quot; and &quot;New New York&quot;.

After the Cranberries went on hiatus in 2003, guitarist Noel Hogan began working on solo work then called Mono Band. Street worked with Hogan in producing the album of the same name released in 2005.

Street also produced the Cranberries&#x27; sixth studio album &quot;Roses&quot;, released in 2012. He also produced their final album &quot;In the End&quot;, released in 2019.

===Kaiser Chiefs and the Ordinary Boys (2004–2007)===
Street produced &quot;Employment&quot;, the debut album by Kaiser Chiefs, after hearing one of their early demos and contacted the band about producing them. At one point, Street brought Blur guitarist Graham Coxon into the studio to rev his moped for a sound effect. This can be heard on the track &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Street produced the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Yours Truly, Angry Mob&quot;. Street also produced the first two albums for ska-influenced indie band the Ordinary Boys: &quot;Over the Counter Culture&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Brassbound&quot; in 2005.

===Babyshambles (2007–present) and Peter Doherty (2008–present)===
Street produced &quot;Shotter&#x27;s Nation&quot;, the second album by Pete Doherty&#x27;s band Babyshambles. The recording of the album was said to have been a hard process, due to Street&#x27;s lack of co-operation with Pete Doherty. Street later commented that &quot;Pete wasn&#x27;t in a very good state for the first couple of weeks of making the record for the reasons that people know about. It was a bit worrying to be honest with you. There were a couple of times I had to fire warning shots across his bow, say &#x27;Listen, you&#x27;ve got to sort yourself out here because if you don&#x27;t I can&#x27;t work with you&#x27;. I felt like I was going to let down the rest of the band if I walked away from things.&quot; Street went on to produce the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Sequel to the Prequel&quot;.

Street produced Doherty&#x27;s solo album &quot;Grace/Wastelands&quot; (2009).

===Other work===
In 1988, Street, along with journalist Jerry Smith, set up the Foundation Label. The label was home to artists including Bradford and Sp!n. However, the label wasn&#x27;t a commercial success and folded in 1991.

In 1989, Street produced and engineered &quot;The Black Swan&quot; by the Triffids. Street produced the 1990 Danielle Dax album &quot;Blast the Human Flower&quot;, released on Sire Records, along with a subsequent remix EP.

Street worked with the Darling Buds on their third and fourth albums &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; (1990) and &quot;Erotica&quot; (1992).

He produced the Caretaker Race&#x27;s album &quot;Hangover Square&quot; in 1990. The band, formed by ex-Loft guitarist Andy Strickland and roving drummer Dave Mew, had recorded a number of singles previously, some produced by John Parrish. For &quot;Hangover Square&quot;, the band added a number of new tracks, including &quot;Man Overboard&quot; and &quot;2 Steel Rings&quot;, both released as singles.

Street worked with Lloyd Cole in 1995, produced Shed Seven&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Let It Ride&quot; and worked with New Order. He also produced several tracks on the Longpigs second album &quot;Mobile Home&quot; in 1999.

In 2001–2002, Street worked from Jacobs Studios in Farnham, Surrey to produce &quot;Wood/Water&quot;, the Promise Ring&#x27;s final album, released by ANTI- in 2002. Street also co-produced &quot;A New Morning&quot; by Suede, released in September 2002.

Street produced &quot;The Magic Treehouse&quot;, the debut album from Ooberman, and &quot;Tired of Hanging Around&quot;, the second album by the Zutons, released in the UK in April 2006.

Street produced the next album by Feeder, released in 2008. Street co-produced the tracks &quot;Save Us&quot; and &quot;Burn the Bridges&quot; from the band&#x27;s &quot;The Singles&quot; album with lead singer Grant Nicholas. An exclusive mix of this track, done entirely by Street, was available from iTunes upon release.

Street worked with alternative post-punk band White Lies when they were known as Fear of Flying, producing &quot;Routemaster&quot; and &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot;.

Manchester indie band the Courteeners approached Street and after hearing demos he offered to produce their album. The album was recorded in London over a six-week stretch and was named &quot;St. Jude&quot;. The album reached No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart, but was subject to mixed reviews.

In August 2010, Street produced the debut EP for Dublin-based band the Vagabonds.

<text>Merlene Joyce Ottey (born 10 May 1960) is a Jamaican-Slovenian former track and field sprinter. She began her career representing Jamaica in 1978 and continued to do so for 24 years before representing Slovenia from 2002 to 2012. She is ranked fourth on the all-time list over 60 metres (indoor), eighth on the all-time list over 100 metres and sixth on the all-time list over 200 metres. She is the current world indoor record holder for 200 metres with 21.87 seconds, set in 1993. She was named Jamaican Sportswoman of the Year 13 times between 1979 and 1995.

Ottey had the longest career as a top-level international sprinter appearing at the 1979 Pan American Games as a 19-year-old fresh from U-20 and Junior competitions, and concluding her career at age 52 when she anchored the Slovene 4 × 100 m relay team at the 2012 European Championships.

A nine-time Olympic medalist, she holds the record for the most Olympic appearances (seven) of any track and field athlete. Although gold medal success at the Olympics eluded Ottey, she was able to bring home three silvers and six bronze medals. She won 14 World Championship medals, and still holds the record (as of 2017) for most medals in individual events with 10. Her career achievements and longevity led to her being called the &quot;Queen of the Track&quot;. Her proclivity for earning bronze medals in major championships earned her the title of &quot;Bronze Queen&quot; in track circles.

Ottey was formerly married to the American high jumper and 400 m hurdler Nat Page and was known as Merlene Ottey-Page during the mid-1980s.

==Life and sprinting career==

Merlene Ottey was born to Hubert and Joan Ottey in Cold Spring, Hanover, Jamaica. She was introduced to the sport by her mother, who bought her a manual on track and field. 

In her early school years in the 1970s, Ottey attended Gurneys Mount and Pondside Schools before graduating from Rusea&#x27;s and Vere Technical High Schools. There, she frequently competed barefoot in local races.

Ottey&#x27;s inspiration came from listening to the track and field broadcast from the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, where Donald Quarrie ran in the sprint finals. Her athletics career took off when she moved to the US and attended the University of Nebraska in 1979, where she joined the track team. She won 14 individual national titles and earned 24 All-America awards, both of which are the most by any Husker student-athlete. Ottey won multiple NCAA titles in each of her five total seasons, including five combined indoor and outdoor titles in 1982 and four in 1981. She earned multiple All-America accolades in each of her five seasons, with seven combined All-America awards in 1982, six in 1980 and five in 1981. Ottey was also a member of Nebraska&#x27;s indoor national championship teams in 1982, 1983 and 1984. She still holds Nebraska&#x27;s top indoor marks in the 55- and 200-meter dashes and the program&#x27;s top outdoor marks in the 100- and 200-meter dashes.

She represented Jamaica in the 1979 Pan American Games, winning a bronze medal in the 200m. She graduated from university with a Bachelor of Arts degree, married fellow athlete Nathaniel Page in 1984, and briefly used the name Merlene Ottey-Page. The couple later divorced.

In the 1980 Moscow games, Ottey became the first female English-speaking Caribbean athlete to win an Olympic medal. Back in Jamaica, she was awarded an Officer of the Order of Nation and the Order of Distinction for &quot;services in the field of sport&quot;.

In the 1982 Commonwealth Games, Ottey won a gold medal in the 200 m and a silver medal in the 100 m. Nearly a decade later, in the 1990 Commonwealth Games, she won gold in both events. Ottey was named Ambassador of Jamaica after winning her gold medal at the 1993 World Championships. She has also been named Jamaican Sportswoman of the Year 13 times between 1979 and 1995.

Throughout her career, she has won nine Olympic medals, which ties with Allyson Felix for the most by any woman in track and field history . These include three silver and six bronze medals. She had never won an Olympic gold medal but lost by five-thousandths of a second to Gail Devers in the 100m final at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta when they both recorded the same time of 10.94 seconds. This was not her closest finish to Devers – she recorded a time of 10.812 seconds to Devers&#x27; 10.811 seconds in the 1993 World Championships in Stuttgart – still the closest finish at an international athletics meet.

Her seven Olympic appearances from 1980 to 2004 are the second most by any Track &amp; Field athlete, after Spanish race walker Jesús Ángel García.

She held the record for most World Championship medals, winning 14 (three gold, three silver, eight bronze) between 1983 and 1997 until Allyson Felix took her total from 13 to 16 in 2017 and then to 18 in 2019. Ottey still holds the record for most World Championship medals in individual events, with 10. 13 of her medals at the Olympics and World Championships were bronze, earning her the nickname &quot;the Bronze Queen&quot; in racing circles. Ottey was appointed an Ambassador at Large by the Jamaican government in 1993. She was inducted into Nebraska&#x27;s first Athletics Hall of Fame Class in 2015.

==Controversy==

In 1999, during a meet in Lucerne, Switzerland, a urine sample submitted had returned positive for the banned anabolic steroid nandrolone. Her &#x27;B&#x27; sample also contained higher than normal levels of the substance. Ottey was subsequently banned by the IAAF from competing in the World Championships in Seville, Spain.

Ottey fought to clear her name, asserting that charge was a &quot;terrible mistake&quot;, and that she was innocent of knowingly taking steroids. In the summer of 2000, Ottey was cleared of all charges by the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association; the IAAF lifted its two-year ban after the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed the case. The case was dismissed because the retesting order by the CAS was not completed in the time frame allotted.

In Jamaica, at the National Senior Trials before selection for the Olympics, Ottey placed a disappointing fourth. According to the rules of the Jamaica Amateur Athletics Association (JAAA), only athletes who had finished in the top three at the trials were eligible to run at the Olympics; she was only qualified to run on the 4 x 100 m relay team. Ottey asked that she be substituted for another team member, a courtesy that had been extended to others in the past. The JAAA&#x27;s decision to replace Peta-Gaye Dowdie with Ottey caused widespread controversy. Dowdie&#x27;s team members and many Jamaicans believed that Ottey had bullied her way onto the team. Jamaican 400 m Olympian and championship medallist Gregory Haughton led the notorious &quot;Games Village&quot; protests to oust Ottey, which made international headlines. The protest ended when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) threatened to throw the Jamaicans out of the Games if the team managers were not able to control their athletes.

At the 2000 Olympics, Ottey finished fourth in the 100 m, beaten from a medal by fellow Jamaican sprinter Tayna Lawrence. The race was won by Marion Jones, who registered 10.75 seconds, followed by Ekaterini Thanou of Greece in 11.12 seconds. Lawrence posted 11.18 seconds to Ottey&#x27;s 11.19 seconds. In the 4×100 relay, the Jamaican team – bronze medalist Lawrence, teenager and newcomer Veronica Campbell, and Beverly McDonald – was anchored by Ottey to a silver medal. This medal gave Ottey her eighth medal, the most ever for a female athlete. Nine years later, after the disqualification of Jones for steroid abuse, Ottey&#x27;s fourth place in the 100 m was retroactively promoted to third – giving Ottey her ninth medal – and Lawrence to second.

Due to the controversy, Ottey decided that &quot;after Sydney, I said I wasn&#x27;t going to run another race for Jamaica ... because I felt like the Jamaicans were trying to push me out of the sport, and I really needed to prove my point, that I might be 40 but I can still run.&quot;

==Slovenia==
In 1998 Ottey moved to Slovenia and began training with Slovene coach Srđan Đorđević. There, she was still representing Jamaica. However, in May 2002, she became a Slovene citizen and resided in Ljubljana, where she represented her new country in international events.

Ottey competed for Slovenia in the 100 metres at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where she reached the semifinals. She finished 5th, missing out on qualification for the final by just 0.03s. At age 46, she competed in the 2006 European Championships in Athletics. She finished fifth in the semi-finals of the 100 metres and did not qualify for the final, which was won by Belgium&#x27;s Kim Gevaert.

Ottey failed by 0.28 seconds to reach her eighth Olympic Games, aged 48 in 2008. Despite this, two years later, she qualified for the Slovenian 4x100-meter relay squad at the 2010 European Athletics Championships, where she became the oldest athlete ever to participate in the history of the European championships.

At the age of 52, Ottey competed in the 4x100 meters relay at the 2012 European Athletics Championships. The Slovenian team were ranked 22nd in the world before the 2012 Olympics with only the top 16 teams qualifying.

Since 2014, Ottey has lived in Switzerland.

<text>Yixin (11January 1833– 29May 1898), better known in English as PrinceKung or Gong,One of the Eight Iron Cap Princes of the Qing Dynasty, was an imperial prince of the Aisin Gioro clan and an important statesman of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in China. He was a regent of the empire from 1861 to 1865 and wielded great influence at other times as well.

Yixin was a man of great talent, excelling in both literature and martial skills, and was among the most capable members of the imperial family. However, he was never favored by his father, the Daoguang Emperor, to succeed to the throne, which meant he spent his life in the role of a political aide rather than a ruler. In 1860, during the Second Opium War, when the British and French forces invaded Beijing, Yixin was entrusted with negotiating peace and signed the Treaty of Beijing on behalf of the Qing court. In 1861, after the death of his elder brother, the Xianfeng Emperor, Yixin, in collaboration with Empress Dowager Cixi, launched the Xinyou Coup, seizing power from the eight regents appointed in the late emperor&#x27;s will. He and Empress Dowager Cixi jointly took charge of the state affairs. In 1881, after the death of his supporter, Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, Yixin&#x27;s position began to weaken. In 1884, Cixi removed him from all his positions, forcing him into political retirement. In 1894, during the First Sino-Japanese War, Yixin was called back into service, and he died four years later in 1898.

Yixin was a key figure and leader of the Self-Strengthening Movement during the late Qing period. He supported figures like Zuo Zongtang, Li Hongzhang, and Zeng Guofan in their efforts to modernize military industries, procure advanced weaponry, and promote the development of modern military infrastructure. He also helped establish the Zongli Yamen, which was responsible for foreign affairs, and set up Chinese embassies abroad. His diplomatic and modernization efforts gained the recognition of foreign powers. Yixin played a significant role in resolving the crises of the Second Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion, and he actively promoted modernization, which led to a brief period of political stability and revitalization for the Qing government. However, his considerable influence and abilities often made him a target of the ruling elites and conservatives, leading to repeated conflicts with Emperor Xianfeng, Emperor Tongzhi, and Empress Dowager Cixi. As a result, his political career was marked by a series of ups and downs, ultimately ending with his complete dismissal.

Yixin&#x27;s tomb is located in Changping District, Beijing. After his death, the title of Prince Gong was passed on to his eldest grandson, Puwei.

==Names==
Yixin is the pinyin romanisation of the Mandarin pronunciation of his Manchu name I-hin. He shared his surname Aisin Gioro with the other members of the Qing imperial family. His courtesy or art name was &quot;Master of the Yuedao Hall&quot; or &quot;Hall of the Way of Music&quot;.

&quot;Kung&quot; is the Wade-Giles romanisation of Mandarin pronunciation of the same Chinese character , now spelt &quot;Gōng&quot; in pinyin. It is not really a name but a part of a descriptive title — &quot;The Respectful Prince of the Blood&quot; — previously borne by Changning, the fifth son of the Shunzhi Emperor. The Chinese title translates literally as &quot;king&quot; but is usually understood as a &quot;prince&quot; in terms of the imperial Chinese nobility. Because Changning&#x27;s rank had not been given &quot;iron-cap&quot; status, each generation of his descendants were reduced in rank unless they somehow proved themselves anew and earned a new title of their own. Yixin, however, was given &quot;iron-cap&quot; status and his direct heirs inherited his full title as well. In English, however, it is usually misunderstood as a name: PrinceKung in older sources and PrinceGong in newer ones. He was also sometimes known as the &quot;Sixth Prince&quot; or, less flatteringly, &quot;Devil #6&quot;. He was posthumously known as &quot;the Respectful and Loyal Prince of the Blood&quot;: Prince Kung-chung or Gongzhong.

==Life==
===Early life===
Yixin was born in the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, as the sixth son of the Daoguang Emperor. He was the third son of his mother, Imperial Noble Consort Jing, who was from the Khorchin Mongol Borjigit clan. He studied in the imperial library and practised martial arts with his fourth brother, Yizhu. He created 28 &quot;qiang&quot; (spear) movements and 18 &quot;dao&quot; (sword) movements, which were respectively named &quot;Lihua Xieli&quot; (棣華協力) and &quot;Bao&#x27;e Xuanwei&quot; (寶鍔宣威) by his father. His father also gave him a White Rainbow Sword (白虹刀) as a gift.

Yixin was mentored by Zhuo Bingtian (卓秉恬) and Jia Zhen (賈楨), two eminent scholar-officials who obtained the position of &quot;jinshi&quot; (進士; successful candidate) in the imperial examination in 1802 and 1826 respectively.

In 1850, when the Daoguang Emperor became critically ill, he summoned Zaiquan (載銓), Zaiyuan, Duanhua, Sengge Rinchen, Mujangga, He Rulin (何汝霖), Chen Fu&#x27;en (陳孚恩) and Ji Zhichang (季芝昌) to Shende Hall (慎德堂) in the Old Summer Palace, where he revealed to them a secret edict he wrote previously. According to the edict, the Fourth Prince, Yizhu, would become the new emperor while Yixin, the Sixth Prince, would be made a &quot;qinwang&quot; (first-rank prince). He died on the same day. However, it is rumored that Yixin was the real successor emperor, and the secret decree have been tampered with.

===Under the Xianfeng Emperor===
Yizhu ascended the throne in 1850 after the death of the Daoguang Emperor and adopted the regnal title &quot;Xianfeng&quot;; he is thus historically known as the Xianfeng Emperor. In accordance with their father&#x27;s secret edict, the newly enthroned Xianfeng Emperor granted Yixin the title &quot;Prince Gong of the First Rank&quot; (恭親王) in the same year. In 1851, the Xianfeng Emperor established an office for Prince Gong, gave him permission to enter the inner imperial court, assigned him to be in charge of patrol and defence matters, and ordered him to continue carrying the White Rainbow Sword given to him by their father.

In October 1853, as the Taiping rebels closed in on Jinan (畿南; the area south of the Hai River), Prince Gong was appointed to the Grand Council, which was in charge of military affairs. The following year, he received three additional appointments: &quot;dutong&quot; (都統; Banner Commander), &quot;you zongzheng&quot; (右宗正; Right Director of the Imperial Clan Court) and &quot;zongling&quot; (宗令; Head of the Imperial Clan Court). He was publicly praised in May 1855 after the Taiping rebels were driven out of Jinan.

When Prince Gong&#x27;s mother died in August 1855, the Xianfeng Emperor reprimanded Prince Gong for failing to observe court protocol and removed him from the Grand Council and his &quot;zongling&quot; and &quot;dutong&quot; appointments. However, Prince Gong was still permitted to enter the inner imperial court and the imperial library. He was restored to his position as a &quot;dutong&quot; in June 1856, and further appointed as an Interior Minister (內大臣) in May 1859.

===Second Opium War===
In September 1860, during the Second Opium War, as British and French forces closed in on the capital Beijing, the Xianfeng Emperor ordered Zaiyuan and Muyin (穆廕) to negotiate for peace at Tongzhou with British and French officials. An Anglo-French delegation sent to negotiate with Chinese officials, which included Harry Smith Parkes and Henry Loch, was taken prisoner by soldiers led by Mongol general Sengge Rinchen during the negotiations. Rinchen then led mounted Mongol troops to attack a Franco-British force at the Battle of Palikao but was defeated. The Xianfeng Emperor recalled Zaiyuan and Muyin from Tongzhou, fled from Beijing with most members of his imperial court to Rehe Province, and appointed Prince Gong as an Imperial Commissioner with Discretion and Full Authority (欽差便宜行事全權大臣).

Prince Gong moved to Changxindian (長辛店; in present-day Fengtai District, Beijing) and called for an assembly of the troops stationed there to enforce greater discipline and raise their morale. On one hand, Qinghui (慶惠) suggested to the Xianfeng Emperor to release Parkes and let Prince Gong continue negotiating. On the other hand, Yidao (義道) urged the emperor to surrender Beijing to the British and French. In the meantime, Anglo-French expeditionary forces captured the Old Summer Palace in the northwest of Beijing, which they proceeded to sack and burn.

On 24 October 1860, Prince Gong concluded the negotiations with British, French and Russian officials, signing the Convention of Peking on behalf of the Qing dynasty. He subsequently wrote a memorial to the Xianfeng Emperor, requesting to be punished for signing an unequal treaty. The emperor replied, &quot;The responsibility assigned to Prince Gong to carry on peace negotiations is not an easy one to shoulder. I deeply understand the difficult situation he was put into. There is no need to punish him.&quot; Prince Gong settled the diplomatic affairs in Beijing by the end of 1860.

In 1861, Prince Gong set up the Zongli Yamen, which functioned as the Qing government&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; foreign affairs ministry, and placed Guiliang (桂良) and Wenxiang in charge of it. He wrote a memorial to the Xianfeng Emperor, proposing to enhance the training of Banner Troops in Beijing and let Qing troops stationed in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces train with the Imperial Russian Army and stockpile military supplies. The generals Shengbao (勝保), Jingchun (景淳) and others were ordered to oversee training of Qing troops stationed in Beijing and northeast China.

===Under the Tongzhi Emperor===
====Xinyou Coup====
Before the Xianfeng Emperor died in August 1861 in the Chengde Mountain Resort, he appointed a group of eight regents – led by Zaiyuan, Duanhua and Sushun – to assist his underage son and successor, Zaichun. Yixin&#x27;s flexible attitude towards dealing with the Western powers had put him at odds with the eight regents, who were politically conservative and opposed to Western influence. Upon request, Prince Gong was granted permission to travel to Chengde to attend the funeral. In Chengde, he met the Empress Dowagers Ci&#x27;an and Cixi and told them about how the eight regents monopolised state power. When the Xianfeng Emperor&#x27;s coffin arrived back in Beijing in November 1861, Prince Gong and the two empress dowagers launched a coup – historically known as the Xinyou Coup (辛酉政變) – to oust the eight regents from power. The regents were arrested and removed from their positions of power.

====As Prince-Regent====
Zaichun, who was enthroned as the &quot;Tongzhi Emperor&quot;, appointed Prince Gong as Prince-Regent (議政王) and granted him some special privileges. These privileges included: &quot;iron-cap&quot; status awarded to the Prince Gong title/peerage; an increment in salary to twice that of a normal &quot;qinwang&quot; (first-rank prince); exemptions from having to kowtow in the emperor&#x27;s presence and having to write his name on memorials submitted to the emperor. Prince Gong firmly declined to accept the &quot;iron-cap&quot; privilege, and instead sought to be concurrently appointed as &quot;zongling&quot; (宗令; Head of the Imperial Clan Court) and put in charge of the Shenjiying (a firearms-equipped unit in the Qing army). The two empress dowagers also ordered Prince Gong to supervise Hongde Hall (弘德殿; a hall in the Forbidden City), where the Tongzhi Emperor studied.

In 1864, Qing forces finally suppressed the Taiping Rebellion after a war lasting more than a decade, and recaptured Jiangning (江寧; in present-day Nanjing) from the rebels. The imperial court issued a decree to praise Prince Gong for his effective leadership in the regency that led to the end of the rebellion – in addition to conferring more prestigious titles on his sons Zaicheng, Zaijun and Zaiying.

As the longstanding leader of the Zongli Yamen, which he established in 1861, Prince Gong was responsible for spearheading various reforms in the early stages of the Self-Strengthening Movement, a series of measures and policy changes implemented by the Qing government with the aim of modernising China. He also founded the Tongwen Guan in 1862 for Chinese scholars to study technology and foreign languages.

====Fall from grace====
Around April 1865, an official, Cai Shouqi (蔡壽祺), accused Prince Gong of &quot;monopolising state power, accepting bribes, practising favouritism, behaving arrogantly, and showing disrespect towards the Emperor&quot;. The Empress Dowagers Ci&#x27;an and Cixi publicly reprimanded Prince Gong and stripped him of his position as Prince-Regent. Yishen (奕脤), Yixuan, Wang Zheng (王拯), Sun Yimou (孫翼謀), Yin Zhaoyong (殷兆鏞), Pan Zuyin, Wang Weizhen (王維珍), Guangcheng (廣誠) and others pleaded with the empress dowagers to pardon Prince Gong and make him Prince-Regent again. Although the empress dowagers did not restore Prince Gong as Prince-Regent, they permitted him to remain in the inner imperial court and continue running the Zongli Yamen. Prince Gong personally thanked the empress dowagers and made a tearful apology. The empress dowagers issued a decree announcing: &quot;The Prince practised favouritism. As we are bound by a common cause and have high expectations of him, we cannot show leniency in punishing him. He will still be allowed to oversee the Grand Council.&quot;

In March 1868, as the Nian rebels approached the suburbs of Beijing, Prince Gong was tasked with mobilising troops and managing defence arrangements. He was also appointed as &quot;you zongzheng&quot; (右宗正; Right Director of the Imperial Clan Court).

In 1869, An Dehai, a court eunuch and close aide of Empress Dowager Cixi, was arrested and executed in Shandong Province by Ding Baozhen, the provincial governor. This was because it was a capital crime for eunuchs to travel out of the Forbidden City without authorisation. The empress dowager became more suspicious of Prince Gong because she believed that he instigated Ding Baozhen to execute An Dehai.

====Demotion and restoration====
In October 1872, when the Tongzhi Emperor married the Jiashun Empress, he granted Prince Gong the &quot;iron-cap&quot; privilege again. He officially took over the reins of power from his regents in around February 1873. In the same year, Prince Gong displeased Empress Dowager Cixi when he strongly opposed her plan to rebuild the Old Summer Palace.

In August 1874, Prince Gong was reprimanded and punished again for failing to observe court protocol. This time, he was demoted from a &quot;qinwang&quot; (first-rank prince) to a &quot;junwang&quot; (second-rank prince). Zaicheng, Prince Gong&#x27;s eldest son, also lost his &quot;beile&quot; title. Despite his demotion, Prince Gong was still allowed to remain in the Grand Council. The following day, the empress dowagers ordered Prince Gong and Zaicheng to be restored as a &quot;qinwang&quot; and &quot;beile&quot; respectively. Towards the end of the year, the Tongzhi Emperor increased Prince Gong&#x27;s salary by more than twice that of a normal &quot;qinwang&quot;, but died not long later in around December.

===Under the Guangxu Emperor===
The Guangxu Emperor, who succeeded the Tongzhi Emperor in 1875, continued the practices of exempting Prince Gong from having to kowtow in the emperor&#x27;s presence and having to write his name on memorials submitted to the emperor. Prince Gong was also appointed as &quot;zongling&quot; (宗令; Head of the Imperial Clan Court).

====Sino-French War====
In 1884, when the French invaded Vietnam, Prince Gong and the members of the Grand Council were unable to arrive at a decision on whether or not to intervene in Vietnam and go to war with the French. As a consequence, Empress Dowager Cixi reprimanded Prince Gong and his colleagues for their dispirited and indecisive attitude towards the war, and removed them from their positions. Prince Gong stopped receiving his double salary and was ordered to retire to recuperate from illness. However, he started receiving his double salary again from November 1886 and was allowed to receive his share of the offerings from ceremonial events. He remained in Jietai Temple in western Beijing for most of the time.

Prince Gong&#x27;s seventh brother, Yixuan (Prince Chun), replaced him as the head of the Grand Council. Some officials such as Baojun (寶鋆), Li Hongzao, Jinglian (景廉) and Weng Tonghe, who previously served in Prince Gong&#x27;s administration, were also dismissed from office. The incident is known as the &quot;Cabinet Change of Jiashen&quot; (甲申易樞) or &quot;Political Change of Jiashen&quot; (甲申朝局之變) because it took place in the &quot;jiashen&quot; year according to the Chinese sexagenary cycle.

====First Sino-Japanese War====
In 1894, when the Japanese invaded Korea and the situation became dire, Empress Dowager Cixi summoned Prince Gong back to the imperial court, placed him in charge of the Zongli Yamen again, and tasked him with supervising the Beiyang Fleet (the Qing navy) and military affairs. Although Prince Gong had been recalled to politics, Empress Dowager Cixi also decreed that since he had not yet recovered from illness, he was exempted from having to constantly attend court sessions.

===Death===
In 1898, Prince Gong was appointed as &quot;zongling&quot; again, but he became critically ill by the end of April. Empress Dowager Cixi visited him three times during this period of time. He eventually died at the age of 67 (by East Asian age reckoning) in May.

The Guangxu Emperor personally attended Prince Gong&#x27;s funeral and, as a sign of mourning, cancelled imperial court sessions for five days and ordered mourning attire to be worn for 15 days. The emperor also granted Prince Gong the posthumous name &quot;Zhong&quot; (忠; literally &quot;loyal&quot;), gave him a place in the Imperial Ancestral Temple, and issued an edict honouring Prince Gong as a role model of loyalty that all Qing subjects should learn from.

<text>Isabelle Coutant-Peyre (5 July 1953 – 12 April 2024) was a French lawyer who was engaged to Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, the international terrorist better known as &quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot;.

==Life and career==
Coutant-Peyre represented Zacarias Moussaoui early on during his imprisonment, while he was awaiting trial for his role in the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001.

Married to a civil servant, she had three sons; Florent, Gabriel and Aurélien. She became a lawyer and worked with Jacques Vergès, defender of Djamila Bouhired and she supported her defence of &quot;revolutionary fighters&quot; with income from her activities as a business lawyer.

In her political cases, she employed &quot;rupture&quot; techniques. She was briefly jailed for likening French police to the Gestapo.

Her fiancé, Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, known as
&quot;Carlos the Jackal&quot;, is held at Clairvaux Prison, part of the general inmate population, and their attempts to marry were frustrated by legal issues. Conjugal visits can only be made after a civil marriage occurs; a Muslim ceremony performed in 2001 (when Carlos was married to his second wife and Isabelle was married to her first husband) reportedly had no legal force. 

Her clients included Stellio Capo Chichi, Youssouf Fofana (murderer of Ilan Halimi), Roger Garaudy, Mohamed Benalel Merah (father of Mohammed Merah responsible for the Toulouse and Montauban shootings), Charles Sobhraj, and the Islamic Republic of Iran against the film &quot;Argo&quot;.

==Death==
Coutant-Peyre died on 12 April 2024, at the age of 70.

<doc id="558068" wikidata="Q694775" url="?curid=558068" title="William McCrea, Baron McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown">
<text>Robert Thomas William McCrea, Baron McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown (born 6 August 1948) is a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician, Christian singer and retired Free Presbyterian minister from Northern Ireland. As a politician, he represented South Antrim and Mid Ulster as their Member of Parliament (MP), representing Mid Ulster from 1983 to 1997; then South Antrim between 2000 and 2001, and then again from 2005 to 2015.

McCrea was also a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for Mid Ulster from 1998 to 2007, before moving to represent South Antrim in the Assembly from 2007 to 2010.

==Early life and education==
McCrea was the youngest of five children born to Robert Thomas (a farmer in Stewartstown, Northern Ireland) and Sarah Jayne in August 1948. He was educated in Magherafelt and spent a short time working in Social Security in the Civil Service of Northern Ireland before beginning training as a Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster minister. He undertook this training at Ravenhill Theological Hall in Belfast.

==Career==
McCrea was a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) member of Magherafelt District Council from its creation in 1973 until he stood down to concentrate on Westminster duties in 2010, and topped the poll in every local government election he contested from 1973–2005.

He ran unsuccessfully for the House of Commons at the 1982 Belfast South by-election. He was Member of Parliament for Mid Ulster from 1983 but lost this seat to Sinn Féin chief negotiator and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness at the 1997 election. He took South Antrim at a by-election in 2000 caused by the death of Ulster Unionist Party MP, Clifford Forsythe, but failed to retain this seat at the 2001 election. In the 2005 election he regained the seat and he held it at the 2010 election. He was subsequently defeated by the Ulster Unionist Party in 2015.

In 1996, he was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum for Mid-Ulster. From 1998 to 2007 he was a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly for Mid Ulster. He was therefore a political representative for two separate constituencies (Mid Ulster and South Antrim) from 2000 to 2001 and from 2005 to 2007.

At the 2007 election, he was elected as an Assembly Member for South Antrim. He resigned from the Assembly in 2010, following his return to Westminster at the general election of that year.

He is also the minister of Magherafelt Free Presbyterian Church and has made numerous gospel albums.

McCrea was created a life peer on 19 June 2018, taking the title Baron McCrea of Magherafelt and Cookstown, of Magherafelt in the County of Londonderry and Cookstown in the County of Tyrone.

==Controversy and paramilitary associations==
McCrea was convicted in 1971 of riotous behaviour in Dungiven and sentenced to six months imprisonment. In 1972, McCrea issued a press release, saying, &quot;We call on all Loyalists to give their continued support to the Ulster Defence Association as it seeks to ensure the safety of all law-abiding citizens against the bombs and bullets of the IRA. As the Catholic population have given their support to the IRA throughout this campaign of terror so must Loyalists grant unswerving support to those engaged in the cause of truth.&quot; In September that year McCrea spoke at a rally in the Shankill Road area of Belfast protesting the conduct of the British Army&#x27;s Parachute Regiment stationed locally, telling the crowd: &quot;We never asked for the Army to come in. The loyalist people of Northern Ireland could have finished it themselves with the forces in this community.&quot; Uniformed UDA members checked cars entering the Glencairn estate before the protest and a UDA Land Rover patrolled in the vicinity. In 1975 he led a prayer service at the funerals of paramilitary members Wesley Somerville and Harris Boyle. The two terrorists were part of the Glenanne gang which carried out the Miami Showband killings and were accidentally blown up when the bomb they were planting in the band&#x27;s minibus went off prematurely, killing them instantly. McCrea also conducted the funeral service for Benjamin Redfern, a UDA member who died while trying to escape the Maze Prison in a bin lorry in August 1984. Redfern was serving a life sentence for the murder of two Catholics.

At the DUP annual conference of April 1986, McCrea interrupted councillor Ethel Smyth when she said she regretted the death of Sean Downes, a 24-year-old Catholic civilian who had been killed by a plastic bullet fired by the Royal Ulster Constabulary
 (RUC) during an anti-internment march in Andersontown in August 1984. McCrea shouted, &quot;No. No. I’ll not condemn the death of John Downes [sic]. No Fenian. Never. No&quot;. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, the word &quot;Fenian&quot; is used as a slur for Roman Catholics.

Speaking in the Northern Ireland Assembly in March 1984 following an attempt on the life of Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams by the UDA which left him seriously wounded McCrea stated:

In December 1986, McCrea aroused controversy when in an interview with &quot;Hot Press&quot; magazine following a recent threat by the &quot;Ulster Freedom Fighters&quot; (the UDA&#x27;s cover name used to claim responsibility for attacks) to bomb Dublin, he commented that the Republic of Ireland &quot;must reap what they sow&quot; for its role in the Anglo-Irish Agreement. McCrea also claimed that the Agreement had come about because of IRA violence, and so people living in the Republic &quot;must expect if they live by the sword they must die by the sword.&quot;

McCrea was the target of a parcel bomb to his home on 9 August 1988, when a package sent by the Irish People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation was disarmed. McCrea had become suspicious when he noticed the package had a Dublin postmark. In September 1991, following the murder of Sinn Féin councillor Bernard O&#x27;Hagan by the UDA (who claimed the shooting under its outlawed &quot;Ulster Freedom Fighters&quot; cover name) in Magherafelt, County Londonderry, McCrea said &quot;He who lives by the sword often dies by the sword&quot; and &quot;[O&#x27;Hagan] without apology stood for the policy of the Armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other&quot;.

In February 1992 McCrea sent a message of sympathy to the family of RUC Constable Alan Moore, who had committed suicide after shooting dead three people and injuring two others at a Sinn Féin advice centre on the Falls Road, Belfast. Moore&#x27;s family lived in Ballymena, outside McCrea&#x27;s constituency; McCrea did not send any message of condolence to the families of the three Catholic men who died in Moore&#x27;s attack.

McCrea was criticised when he appeared on a platform at a Portadown rally in support of the senior Ulster loyalist paramilitary Billy Wright, who had been threatened by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) leadership, in September 1996. Wright was the founder and leader of the Loyalist Volunteer Force (which had broken away from the UVF), and had been threatened after he broke the UVF ceasefire by ordering the death of Catholic civilian Michael McGoldrick.

In 2000, McCrea was the subject of an early day motion by two MPs, Harry Barnes and Sir Peter Bottomley. The motion referenced a claim that McCrea had visited Wright&#x27;s successor as LVF leader in order to persuade the LVF not to decommission any of its weapons. This claim has yet to be substantiated.

===Call for British airstrikes against Irish towns===
A Northern Ireland Office memo released under the thirty-year rule in December 2014 revealed that McCrea had called for the Royal Air Force to carry out &quot;strikes against Dundalk, Drogheda, Crossmaglen and Carrickmore&quot; at the DUP&#x27;s annual conference in April 1986.

===Alternative medicine===
McCrea is a supporter of homeopathy, having signed several early day motions in support of its continued funding on the National Health Service, sponsored by Conservative MP David Tredinnick.

<doc id="558070" wikidata="Q2706542" url="?curid=558070" title="Julian Sark">
<text>Julian Sark is a recurring fictional character portrayed by David Anders on the ABC television series &quot;Alias&quot;. The series follows Sydney Bristow, an operative working for an organization called SD-6 which she believes is a covert branch of the Central Intelligence Agency. However, she learns it is actually a subsidiary of the Alliance of Twelve, a crime syndicate which seeks to make profits from stolen intelligence and artifacts. Upon learning the truth Sydney offers her services to the CIA as a double agent with the intention of destroying SD-6 from within.

Julian Sark is introduced in the first season&#x27;s fourteenth episode, &quot;The Coup&quot;, where he is seen meeting the head of K-Directorate in Moscow on behalf of the person known only as &quot;The Man&quot; who intends to purchase Rambaldi&#x27;s journal. The character appears in 46 more instances, with Anders credited in the title sequence nine times during the course of the show. The last one is the series finale, &quot;All The Time In The World&quot;, in which Marcus Dixon asks Sydney to intercept Sark as he attempts to sell a stolen hard disk containing classified information. It is unknown whether the mission was carried out or if the disk was sold.

==Character biography==
Little is known about Sark&#x27;s background. He spent most of his youth in the United Kingdom, although a voice analysis reveals he spent a lot of time in Galway, Ireland. He is the heir to a vast fortune from his Romanov-descended father, Andrian Lazarey. He routinely changes his alliances, and his true allegiance seems to be only to himself. He is notorious for his self-described &quot;flexible loyalties&quot; and his ability to evade and escape capture. Sark is a connoisseur of fine champagne.

===Season 1===
Sark is seen initially operating as an agent of a criminal organization headed by a mysterious figure known only as &quot;The Man&quot; (believed at first to be Alexander Khasinau but later revealed to be Irina Derevko). He leads a strike team against FTL Headquarters, personally killing FTL head Quan Li in broad daylight literally outside FTL&#x27;s front door. The attack, coinciding precisely with McKenas Cole&#x27;s unsuccessful assault on SD-6, was designed to retrieve an unknown Rambaldi artifact (as Cole&#x27;s was designed to obtain an ampule of unknown liquid). FTL&#x27;s operatives list is compromised and within hours, FTL ceases to exist. Arvin Sloane states that this previously unknown organization now has the most significant collection of Rambaldi artifacts in the world.

SD-6 learns of a meeting scheduled between the organization and K-Directorate to discuss the sharing of Rambaldi technology. Sydney and Dixon are tasked to eavesdrop on the meeting. Sark offers to transfer $100 million to K-Directorate&#x27;s Cayman Islands account. In exchange, he demands the Rambaldi manuscript (which includes Page 47). The offer is rejected, and Sark instantly assassinates Ilyich Ivankov, leader of K-Directorate. The suddenly promoted new leader of K-Directorate, Lavro Kessar, accepts the offer. Sydney, who is dangling outside the window spying on the meeting, is spotted, a firefight ensues and Sark slips away. He is next seen in Tunisia trying to retrieve the Rambaldi manuscript, but Sydney gets to it first.

Sark travels to Denpasar to buy a second ampule of Rambaldi liquid so he can expose a Rambaldi document (possibly the artifact retrieved from FTL). Unknown to him, the buy is a sting set up by Sydney and Michael Vaughn. The buy is disrupted by Dixon and other SD-6 agents. Sark flees with the ampule but Vaughn captures him and recovers it. When Vaughn abandons Sark to rescue Sydney, SD-6 recovers him.

While in SD-6 custody Sark agrees to lead SD-6 to Khasinau in his Paris nightclub to recover the Rambaldi document. Sydney and Dixon are tasked to retrieve the document and replace it with a forgery. Sydney is further tasked by Vaughn to switch out the document with a counterfeit, but is unable to because she spots Will Tippin, who&#x27;s been brought to Paris to meet a mysterious contact to discuss &quot;The Circumference,&quot; in the club. Dixon recovers the document and Sydney extracts Will and, with Jack&#x27;s aid, returns him to Los Angeles.

Sark escapes from the club, but Sloane had previously laced Sark&#x27;s wine with a radioactive isotope and is tracking his location by satellite. However, Sark becomes aware of this and undergoes a full blood transfusion in Geneva. While SD-6 is on a wild goose chase to Switzerland, Sark actually returns to Los Angeles and kidnaps Will Tippin from a CIA safehouse. To secure Tippin&#x27;s release, Jack steals the ampule from the CIA and Sydney steals the document from SD-6. Jack and Sydney expose the page and realize that it&#x27;s The Circumference, instructions on how to use the Mueller device. Jack travels to Taipei and makes the exchange, and Sark vanishes into the night.

===Season 2===
Sark initially assumes control of Irina&#x27;s assets but later allies with SD-6, but secretly collaborates with Sloane to provide Sydney with the location of &quot;Server 47,&quot; on which is housed enough intelligence to bring about the destruction of The Alliance of Twelve and all SD cells. However, no Rambaldi artifacts are found in any of the SD sites. Following the fall of SD-6, Sark continues to work with Sloane. He kidnaps the wife and son of mathematician Dr. Neil Caplan to coerce Caplan into assembling Rambaldi artifacts into a neutron bomb as well as coordinating the murder and replacement of Sydney&#x27;s friend Francie Calfo by Allison Doren, who has been transformed by Project Helix into Francie&#x27;s genetic duplicate. At the end of the season, Sark is taken into CIA custody.

===Season 3===
Sark becomes the chief financier of The Covenant. The Covenant, during the two-year time when Sydney was undercover as Julia Thorne, sent Sydney to assassinate Andrian Lazarey. Lazarey is Sark&#x27;s father, and his apparent death causes $800 million in gold bullion to pass to Sark. These funds are seized by the Covenant in exchange for his release from CIA custody and Sark, despite having provided much of the organization&#x27;s operating capital, feels he is relegated to the status of &quot;foot soldier.&quot;

Sark carries out missions for the Covenant, sometimes with the aid of Lauren Reed, a double agent positioned within the NSC and married to Vaughn. One mission he undertakes with Allison Doren. With the apparent destruction of Project Helix, Doren is trapped in Francie&#x27;s form but Sark, who claims to love her, says it doesn&#x27;t matter. Doren is killed by Tippin in the course of that mission.

Sark and Reed become lovers and eventually conspire to assassinate the leaders of the six Covenant cells in an attempt to take control of the organization. They manage the assassinations and are congratulated by McKenas Cole, who has become second-in-command of The Covenant. It is at this point that Sark&#x27;s first name is revealed to be Julian. McKenas Cole appoints Sark and Lauren co-leaders of the North American cell. They ally once again with Arvin Sloane to obtain the Rambaldi equation that Nadia Santos, &quot;The Passenger,&quot; channels but are unsuccessful. Reed carries out a mission wearing a mask to impersonate Sydney to obtain the equation from the CIA and plant a bomb in their headquarters, while Sark monitors her remotely. She escapes but he is captured, and Sydney uses a mask and voice changer to impersonate Reed so she can get information from him.

===Season 4===
During his second CIA-imposed imprisonment, Sark is released into the custody of Sydney and Vaughn to help track down terrorist Anna Espinosa. He agrees to help but demands to see proof that Lauren (whom, Allison notwithstanding, Sark also claims is &quot;the woman [he] loved&quot;) is in fact dead. After seeing her body in a secret CIA crypt, Sark realizes that it was Vaughn who killed her. During the mission, Espinosa helps Sark escape, and the two briefly collaborate in the selling of a chemical bomb before Sark abandons Anna to Sydney&#x27;s tender mercies and disappears for the remainder of the season.

===Season 5===
The episode &quot;Bob&quot; marks Sark&#x27;s return to the series. With the death of Covenant leader Elena Derevko and the resulting apparent fall of The Covenant, Sark has gone freelance; on this occasion he is working on behalf of a Sudanese warlord to obtain a weapon of mass destruction. New APO recruit Rachel Gibson and he have a tryst while waiting for a transmission that neither knows the other intends to intercept. After Gibson discovers his identity and reports this to APO, Sark is hired by the agency to help recover the weapon, though he ultimately refuses payment after Gibson saves his life. In the episode &quot;I See Dead People&quot; Sloane sends Sark a secret message, presumably to secure his services to work with Anna Espinosa (in reality, Sydney impersonating Anna, who has been doubled into Sydney and subsequently killed by her). Sark engineers for them to be taken into custody in an Italian prison to secure a Rambaldi amulet from an elderly man known only as &quot;The Rose.&quot;

Sark later teams with Sloane and Kelly Peyton to obtain The Horizon, the final Rambaldi artifact Sloane needs to complete his endgame, from Irina in exchange for two missiles. After planting a bomb to destroy APO headquarters (killing Thomas Grace), Sark accompanies Sloane to Mongolia to excavate the tomb of Milo Rambaldi and becomes involved in a stand-off involving Vaughn, Jack Bristow and other of Sloane&#x27;s operatives. In a gun battle in Rambaldi&#x27;s tomb, Sark retrieves the Horizon and returns it to Irina in Hong Kong. On Irina&#x27;s orders, Sark prepares to launch the missiles at Washington, D.C., and London but is captured and shot by Vaughn. He gives Vaughn the codes to abort the launch and Vaughn apparently allows the wounded Sark to depart.

Several years later, Marcus Dixon approaches a semi-retired Sydney and Vaughn and asks for their help with a field assignment. It&#x27;s revealed that Sark has continued his unbroken track record of survival and is behind the incident Dixon is seeking help with. Sydney jokingly chides Vaughn for allowing Sark to get away years earlier.

<doc id="558072" wikidata="Q1039354" url="?curid=558072" title="Hooge, Prince Su">
<text>Hooge (Manchu: ; 16 April 1609 – 4 May 1648), formally known as [[Prince Su]], was a Manchu prince of the Qing dynasty. He was the eldest son of Hong Taiji, the second ruler of the Qing dynasty.

==Life==
Hooge was born in the Aisin Gioro clan as the eldest son of Hong Taiji, the second ruler of the Qing dynasty. His mother was Lady Ula Nara, one of Hong Taiji&#x27;s consorts.

Hooge participated in military campaigns against the Mongols, Koreans and the Ming dynasty. After Hong Taiji&#x27;s death in 1643, Hooge and his uncle Dorgon fought over the succession to the throne. The situation was to Hooge&#x27;s advantage because three of the Eight Banners previously under Hong Taiji&#x27;s control had been passed on to him. On the other hand, Dorgon had the support of his brothers and two White Banners. This meant that the remaining two Red Banners controlled by Daišan and his son, as well as the Bordered Blue Banner under Chiurhala, were crucial to ensuring that Hooge could win the succession. After much dispute, Daišan started favouring Hooge, who ostensibly refused to take the throne. Hooge was actually waiting for others to urge him to take the throne, so that he could sit on it without projecting a power-hungry image of himself. Unfortunately for Hooge, Dorgon and his brothers gave way, so the conflict continued without a solution. The power struggle concluded with a compromise in order to avoid internal strife. Dorgon nominated Fulin, another son of Hong Taiji born to Consort Zhuang, to be the new ruler, so Fulin ascended to the throne as the Shunzhi Emperor.

Even after the Shunzhi Emperor came to power, there was still much friction between Hooge and Dorgon. According to popular belief, Hooge had conceived a scheme to seize the throne from the Shunzhi Emperor, but he leaked out his plan to Dorgon&#x27;s brother Dodo, who informed Dorgon about it. Dorgon then used this as an excuse to have Hooge arrested and thrown into prison. However historical records state that Hooge was imprisoned after the Qing government launched military campaigns against remnant rebel forces in western China, and he died during his incarceration. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1650, two years after his death.

<doc id="558078" wikidata="Q929700" url="?curid=558078" title="Coats Group">
<text>Coats Group plc is a British multinational company. The company provides products, including apparel, accessory and footwear threads, structural components for footwear and accessories, fabrics, yarns, and software applications. 

Coats is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index and FTSE4Good Index. Revenues in 2023 were $1.4bn.

==Founding==

Paisley, Scotland became a hub for the textile industry in the United Kingdom. In 1755 James and Patrick Clark began a loom equipment and silk thread business. In 1806, Patrick Clark invented a way of twisting strands of cotton together to substitute for silk that was unavailable due to the French blockade of Great Britain. He opened the first plant for manufacturing the cotton thread in 1812.
In 1802 James Coats set up his own weaving in Paisley. In 1826 he opened a cotton mill at Ferguslie to produce his own thread and, when he retired in 1830, his sons, James &amp; Peter, took up the business under the name of J. &amp; P. Coats.

In 1890 Coats listed on the London Stock Exchange, with capital of £5.7 million.

== Implantation in the United States ==
The firm expanded internationally, particularly to the United States. In 1869, J. &amp; P. Coats signed a contract with the Conant Thread Company in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, which entitled them to use of the Conant company’s manufacturing facilities. This move towards local production in the United States was primarily driven by high tariffs on imported goods, including thread. 

In 1893, J. &amp; P. Coats absorbed the Conant Thread Company and assumed direct control over the Pawtucket plant, under the management of James Coats (1834–1913) and Alfred M. Coats (1869–1942). In 1896 J. and P. Coats acquired controlling interests in the firms of Clark and Co, Jonas Brook and Brothers, and James Chadwick and Brother. The Clark family had manufacturing sites in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. as the Clark Thread Co. since 1864. 

J &amp; P Coats moved their base of operations to Delaware in 1951 and officially closed the plant in Pawtucket in November of 1964.

== Mergers and Consolidation ==
In 1952 J. &amp; P. Coats and the Clark Thread Co. merged to become Coats &amp; Clark&#x27;s. In 1961 a merger with Patons and Baldwins created Coats Patons. In 1986 a merger with Vantona Viyella created Coats Viyella. In 2003 Guinness Peat took Coats private and in 2015 the business returned to the market as &quot;Coats Group&quot;.

Coats was fined €110 million by the European Commission in 2007 for participation in cartels with Prym, YKK, and other companies to fix and manipulate the prices of zips and other fasteners, and of the machinery to make them. One of the cartels ran for twenty-one years. An appeal in 2012 to the General Court of the European Union was dismissed, and the fine upheld.

The company acquired the footwear components business, Texon, in July 2022, and the footwear reinforcement components business, Rhenoflex, in August 2022.

<doc id="558084" wikidata="Q8038337" url="?curid=558084" title="Wrigley Square">
<text>Wrigley Square is a public square located in the northwest section of Millennium Park in the Historic Michigan Boulevard District of the Loop area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The square is located at the southeast corner of the intersection of East Randolph Street and North Michigan Avenue. It contains the Millennium Monument, a nearly full-sized replica of the semicircle of paired Roman Doric-style columns (called a peristyle) that originally sat in this area of Grant Park, near Michigan Avenue and Randolph Street, between 1917 and 1953. The square also contains a large lawn and a public fountain.

==Detail==

Lying between Lake Michigan to the east and the Loop to the west, Grant Park has been Chicago&#x27;s front yard since the mid 19th century. Its northwest corner, north of Monroe Street and the Art Institute, east of Michigan Avenue, south of Randolph Street, and west of Columbus Drive, had been Illinois Central rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it was made available for development by the city as Millennium Park. Today, Millennium Park trails only Navy Pier as a Chicago tourist attraction.

The square is a tree-lined section of Millennium Park with a large lawn. The area broadcasts free Wi-Fi wireless technology. The square has earned a reputation as an outdoor culture spot by hosting a wide range of cultural events such as local and international art and photography exhibitions, as well as occasional live musical performances. This reputation is reminiscent of the earlier neo-classical meeting place. When Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley dedicated the square, it was dedicated to the donors, known as the Founders Group, who funded Millennium Park.

In 2005, Millennium Park was marked for updates and improvements. Benches were to be added to the 56 original benches. Landscape architect Kathryn Gustafson designed 14 new , aluminum &quot;Maggie benches&quot; in Millennium Park, mostly in Wrigley square, in honor of Mayor Daley&#x27;s wife.

The square was intended to serve as an exhibit space for outdoor sculpture as well as small cultural performances, according to Christopher Perille, vice president of the Wrigley Square Foundation. The square&#x27;s peristyle monument is in remembrance of the corporation, foundations, and individuals who made Millennium Park possible.
An architectural model of Wrigley Square and Millennium Monument, designed by O&#x27;Donnell, Wicklund, Pigozzi and Peterson Architects, Inc. (OWP&amp;P) in 2000, is on display at the Harold Washington Library Center.

===Original peristyle===
In 1917, the original peristyle was designed by renowned Chicago planner Edward H. Bennett, who was Daniel Burnham&#x27;s partner in the Plan of Chicago and who was known for designing the nearby Buckingham Fountain. It was located in Grant Park in the same location as the current Wrigley Square. The original peristyle rose to and had a diameter of . The original was made of concrete, which did not stand up to the Lake Michigan lakefront weather. In 1953 it was razed to make way for the Grant Park North Garage. The original peristyle was on a promenade with balustrades.

===Millennium Monument===
A gift from the William Wrigley, Jr. Company, the limestone replica peristyle rises to a height of nearly (one source says the columns were planned to rise to ), restoring a classical elegance to Grant Park. The William Wrigley, Jr. Foundation contributed $5 million to the monument, and the entire square, which cost $5 million to build, was named in its honor. The &quot;Millennium Monument&quot; is a tribute to the individual, corporate and foundation benefactors of Millennium Park. The pedestal of the peristyle is inscribed with the names of the 115 financial donors (including Oprah Winfrey) who made the 91 contributions of at least $1 million each to help pay for Millennium Park. &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes the pedestal as French marble, but other sources mention the use of French limestone. These 115 donors are referred to as the founders of Millennium Park in official park brochures published by the City of Chicago and distributed at the visitor&#x27;s centers as well as in other press accounts. Their contributions not only paid for the construction of the park, but also provide for its ongoing conservation.
The David Dillon and Michael Patrick Sullivan (of OWP&amp;P) design is based on original drawings by Bennett found in the Chicago Park District&#x27;s archive.

The naming rights of the space belong to Wm. Wrigley Jr, the foundation that created the world&#x27;s famous chewing gum. Wrigley Company officials, including William Wrigley, Jr. II, wanted to contribute to Millennium Park, and the historic aspect of the peristyle was attractive to them partly because the original peristyle was constructed around the same time as the Wrigley Building, the corporate headquarters located a few blocks to the north, and because the classical architectural styles of both are similar.

The 24 paired, fluted columns are the same height as the original peristyle. However, the structure was scaled down to an diameter in order to accommodate the accessible ramp that runs behind the monument. Each of the limestone columns is cut from an Indiana quarry

and made of five sections reinforced by steel rods and plates. The fountain in front of the monument is a bronze-cast replica of the finials that adorn the Wrigley Building. The brass spout was made from a mold of a terra cotta finail on the Wrigley Building.

The front of the monument has a dedication plaque (pictured left). In addition, on the reverse side in approximately the same location, the monument has a special plaque commemorating John H. Bryan&#x27;s contribution as the head of fundraising for the Park.

The original model of the Millennium Monument was the starting point of the Peristyle appearance in Chicago. To this day, it is said to not compare to the once &quot;commanding presence&quot; that once stood in its place, before being demolished and replaced with an underground parking garage. The new monument was downsized by approximately 15% to accommodate a wheel-chair ramp for the disabled in a tight space. It also includes a &quot;classical&quot; take on the original, incorporating a fountain at the base of the limestone, Doric, column monument. The monument, despite being relatively small in comparison to the rest of Grant Park, makes its presence known as the central focus to shape Wrigley Square and the surrounding landscape. Wrigley Square is unique for its fountain that, unlike Buckingham Fountain, which is fenced off, remains open with a circular ledge to allow park-goers the freedom to sit next to the open water to enjoy the atmosphere.

<text>Kirsty Jackson Young (born 23 November 1968) is a Scottish television and radio presenter.

From 2006 to 2018 she was the main presenter of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. She presented &quot;Crimewatch&quot; on BBC One from 2008 to 2015.

== Early life ==
Young was born in East Kilbride. She attended Cambusbarron Primary School and Stirling High School. She returned in June 2008 to officially open the school&#x27;s new building. On the first episode of her first TV show she shared with viewers that she had suffered from bulimia as a teenager. In a later interview she said &quot;It only happened for a very fleeting few months and I dealt with it myself.&quot;

Young decided not to attend university. Her media career began when she became a runner and then a researcher.

== Career ==
Young became a continuity announcer for BBC Radio Scotland in 1989. In 1992, she moved to Scottish Television as a presenter of &quot;Scotland Today&quot;, which resulted in her chat show &quot;Kirsty&quot;. She left &quot;Scotland Today&quot; in 1996 to become a relief presenter for &quot;The Time, The Place&quot; and appeared on the &quot;Holiday&quot; programme. She co-hosted a consumer show, &quot;The Street&quot;, on BBC Two.

In March 1997, she joined the news team of the new terrestrial channel, Channel 5, presenting the channel&#x27;s flagship news programme &quot;Channel 5 News&quot;. In 1999, Young competed in the first &quot;Celebrity Stars in their Eyes&quot;, winning the competition with her Peggy Lee impersonation, singing the hit &quot;Fever&quot;. Young then left Channel 5 to join ITV in 2000 and briefly hosted the quiz show &quot;The People Versus&quot;. In 2001, she became a co-presenter of the &quot;ITV Evening News&quot;. Later the same year, after giving birth to her first child, she decided to return to Channel 5 to again front &quot;Channel 5 News&quot; from 14 January 2002.

In November 2003, Young presented an edition of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. She has since featured on the show a further eleven times. In 2004, she made an appearance on &quot;Room 101&quot;, during which she nominated cowboy boots, Britney Spears, Brazilian waxes and &#x27;baby on board&#x27; stickers among her pet hates.

In June 2006, Young was announced as the new presenter of the long-running BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, replacing Sue Lawley; she began on 1 October 2006. According to the odds given by bookmaker William Hill she was an outsider for the job at 20/1. She returned to Five News on 28 September 2006, but in 2007, Young announced that she would be leaving Channel 5 News in the autumn, following ten years as its head anchor since the programme&#x27;s inception on the same day as Channel 5&#x27;s launch (30 March), a decade earlier. On 29 August 2007, she presented her last show.

On 29 September, a month after leaving Channel 5, the BBC announced that Young would succeed Fiona Bruce as the presenter of &quot;Crimewatch&quot;. She presented the show from January 2008 until December 2015.

From 11 January 2010, she presented a four-part BBC TV series entitled &quot;The British Family&quot;. In March–April 2011, she presented the TV series &quot;The British at Work&quot;.

On 31 August 2018, it was announced that Young would be stepping down from &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; &quot;for a number of months&quot; to receive treatment for a form of fibromyalgia, and that Lauren Laverne would deputise during this period. In July 2019, Young announced that she was to stand down as the host of &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, saying: &quot;Having been forced to take some months away from my favourite job because of health problems, I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m now well on the way to feeling much better. But that enforced absence from the show has altered my perspective on what I should do next and so I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s time to pursue new challenges&quot;. The BBC&#x27;s director of Radio and Education, James Purnell, called Young a &quot;wonderful host&quot;. It was confirmed that Lauren Laverne of Radio 6 Music would be continuing in Young&#x27;s role &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot;.

On 2 June 2022, Young presented &quot;Platinum Beacons: Lighting up the Jubilee&quot;, BBC One&#x27;s live coverage of the lighting of more than 1,500 beacons to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s 70-year reign.

Young fronted the later part of the BBC&#x27;s television coverage of the state funeral of Elizabeth II at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle on 19 September 2022. She received praise for her closing monologue at the end of the broadcast.

Since 2023, Young has presented &quot;Young Again&quot; on BBC Radio 4, in which Young interviews notable guests about what they would tell their younger selves.

== Personal life ==
Young dated Kenny Logan for 3 years until 1999.

Young is married to businessman Nick Jones, the founder of Soho House club. She has two daughters with Jones and two stepchildren from Jones&#x27; first marriage.

Young and her husband purchased Inchconnachan, an island in Loch Lomond, with the intention of building holiday lets on the island. The island is the home of a colony of wild wallabies that has lived on the island for 80 years. To make way for the holiday lets, Young and her husband considered relocating the wallabies, although this has seen some opposition. The island is an area of special scientific interest and conservation area, thus their development plans attracted criticism from local conservationists in 2022.

===Health===
On Christmas Day 2022, Young appeared as the interviewee on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, the programme that she had hosted up until 2018, when she stepped down for health reasons, suffering from fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. She chose as her luxury item a home cinema with access to every film she had ever watched.

In an interview on 8th August 2024 with Emma Barnett, Young said she was living in chronic pain and said she felt a sense of &quot;failure and shame&quot;, as well as a reluctance to talk about it to other people. She said that living with her chronic pain could make her feel &#x27;hollowed out&#x27; and to lose her sense of self. Young supported self-management techniques to help live with chronic pain.

== Appointments ==
In 2016 Young was appointed president of UNICEF UK; and was succeeded in 2020 by actress Olivia Colman.

In October 2019 she was appointed as a director of Sussex Royal, &quot;The Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex&quot;, and served until the Foundation was dissolved in July 2020.

<doc id="558089" wikidata="Q1935644" url="?curid=558089" title="Primal Scream (Primal Scream album)">
<text>Primal Scream is the second studio album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream. It was released on 4 September 1989 in the United Kingdom by Creation Records and in the United States by Mercenary Records. Musically, it took a harder rock approach than their 1987 debut &quot;Sonic Flower Groove&quot; and did not achieve great success. However, the song &quot;I&#x27;m Losing More Than I&#x27;ll Ever Have&quot; was later remixed to provide the breakthrough single &quot;Loaded&quot;, which appeared on their much celebrated third album &quot;Screamadelica&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The album received mixed-to-positive reviews from music critics. Tim Sendra of AllMusic wrote: &quot;While the group was capable of whipping up a credible approximation of thuggish hard rock, Bobby Gillespie&#x27;s fragile wisp of a voice is rather ill-suited to kicking out the jams.&quot;

<doc id="558094" wikidata="Q2732002" url="?curid=558094" title="Irina Derevko">
<text>Irina Derevko () is a fictional character on the television series &quot;Alias&quot;, and a main character during the second season of the series. Irina, played by Lena Olin, is the mother of the central character, Sydney Bristow.

==Biography==
She is first mentioned as Laura Bristow, the wife of Jack Bristow and mother of Sydney Bristow, who died in a car accident when Sydney was six years old. Sydney had always believed that her mother had died, and that she had been a professor of English Literature.

Laura Bristow was, however, a spy for the Soviet Union. Her real name was Irina Derevko and she was recruited into the KGB at the age of 18 by Alexander Khasinau. She was assigned to infiltrate the United States, and to gain the trust of Jack Bristow, then a CIA agent, in order to steal classified information regarding Project Christmas.

Under the alias of Laura, she approached Jack Bristow posing as an exchange student from the USSR. They eventually married and she became his confidante. In order to seal Jack&#x27;s allegiance to her, the KGB demanded that she bear him a child. She gave him Sydney. In late 1981, Derevko disappeared after faking her own death. She returned to Russia, where she spent time in a KGB facility as a suspected traitor. Her whereabouts, however, were mostly unknown by the intelligence community at large until the end of season one.

Jack tried to prevent Sydney from discovering the truth about her mother. He was forced to reveal the truth to Sydney when she mistakenly thought that he had been a KGB mole. At the end of the first season, Sydney discovered that her mother was alive and also the mysterious criminal overlord known up to that point only as &quot;The Man&quot;.

Derevko turned herself in to the CIA early in season two. She provided information to help bring down the SD-6, and assisted with other important missions. Jack, predicting that Irina would betray them, framed her for providing false information about a mission in Madagascar. The CIA planned to execute her. Agent Michael Vaughn learned the truth and helped Sydney stop her mother&#x27;s execution. Later, during a mission in Panama, Irina did betray the CIA and joined forces with Arvin Sloane and Sark.

Her subsequent whereabouts were unknown throughout season three, although she continued to be in occasional contact with Jack via Internet Relay Chat. She arranged for her sister, Katya Derevko, to assist Jack and Sydney on occasion. It was also learned that Irina had had an affair with Arvin Sloane and had a second daughter, Nadia Santos.

At the beginning of season four, Sydney learned that Irina had hired a hit man to kill her. Jack Bristow received permission from his superiors to execute Irina, and in &quot;Another Mr. Sloane&quot; he states that he carried out the act himself. Sydney, unaware that Irina had ordered her death, later identified Irina&#x27;s body in a Moscow medical facility and arranged for her burial in a Moscow crypt.

In the fourth season episode &quot;Ice&quot;, Nadia discovers a photograph of Irina holding a baby. Jack tells her that Irina told him that she had a niece. This niece preceded Sydney and was supposedly why Irina wanted a baby of her own. When Sydney was born Irina held her as she had the baby in the photo. No further information regarding the actual identity of the infant was ever presented and neither of the other Derevko sisters ever mentioned having a baby. Elena specifically said (in &quot;Before The Flood&quot;) that she never wanted children. Jack presumes that the photo was just another ruse by Irina to mislead him.

The shooting of Irina occurred 18 months prior to the season four finale and sometime prior to season three&#x27;s finale, &quot;Resurrection&quot;. The fourth season finale revealed that a genetic modification procedure known as Project Helix was used to create a double of Irina, and it is this woman whom Jack shot dead. The attempt on Sydney&#x27;s life was placed by Irina&#x27;s other sister, Elena Derevko, to mislead Jack into thinking he had killed his wife. The woman who underwent the genetic therapy was an agent of The Covenant, Elena&#x27;s own criminal organization, who had volunteered to take Irina&#x27;s place and be assassinated.

The real Irina was imprisoned by Elena and tortured for her knowledge of Rambaldi&#x27;s secrets. After 18 months, she was rescued by her daughters (she had not seen Nadia since her birth) and Jack. Although technically under arrest by the CIA, Irina was given permission to help stop Elena from completing her plans. After the successful completion of the mission, Jack and Sydney allowed her to escape rather than return to America and imprisonment.

During the fifth season, it is revealed that Irina is involved to an unknown extent in the Prophet Five organization. Irina is seen observing Sydney&#x27;s interrogation under hypnosis at the end of the episode &quot;The Horizon&quot;. It is revealed she had Kelly Peyton kidnap Sydney to recover information about the Horizon, a Rambaldi artifact that would grant its wielder immortality. After Sydney appears to reveal the code crucial to her abductors&#x27; attempts to find the Horizon, Irina tells Peyton to make Sydney comfortable and leaves the observation room. In the episode &quot;Maternal Instinct&quot; she reunites briefly with Sydney and Jack, during which they discover her affiliation with Prophet Five and Irina also indicates that she gave the order to kill Michael Vaughn. She also tells Sydney that she never wanted to have children, and that she only did so on orders from the KGB. After helping Sydney deliver her baby (during an attack by Kelly Peyton), Irina disappears again.

Irina finally met her demise in Hong Kong in the series finale. She retrieves the Horizon, which she had traded to Sloane for a pair of missiles, through Kelly Peyton. She ordered Sark to launch the missiles at Washington, D.C., and London. Jack assumed that Sloane wanted to use the missiles not to simply destroy areas with high population densities, but to profit from the reconstruction. Sydney tracked her down and learned that Irina sought the same immortality that Sloane had apparently found. Sydney and Irina battled a final time, precariously balanced on a skylight. Choosing to grab the Horizon rather than her daughter&#x27;s hand, Irina fell through the skylight to her death.

==Portrayal==
Besides Lena Olin, several other actresses portrayed Irina in the course of the series:

*Arabella Holzbog portrayed Irina/Laura Bristow in a photograph Sydney kept
*Kate Anthony was the voice of Irina Derevko in the video clip shown in episode 1.19, &quot;Snowman&quot;
*Natasha Pavlovich is the woman actually seen as Irina Derevko in that video clip
*April Webster played Irina when she walks up to Sydney at the end of episode 1.22, &quot;Almost Thirty Years&quot;
*Mía Maestro portrayed Irina/Laura in a photograph seen in episode 4.4, &quot;Ice&quot;

==Sisters==
===Katya Derevko===

Yekatarina &quot;Katya&quot; Derevko, played by Isabella Rossellini, was the first of Irina&#x27;s sisters to be announced. She first appeared in the third season to assist Jack and Sydney, but later revealed herself to be allied with The Covenant and was taken into federal custody.

<text>Virginia Lilian Emmeline Compton-Mackenzie, (; 18 September 1894 – 12 December 1978), known professionally as Fay Compton, was an English actress. She appeared in several films, and made many broadcasts, but was best known for her stage performances. She was known for her versatility, and appeared in Shakespeare, drawing room comedy, pantomime, modern drama, and classics such as Ibsen and Chekhov. In addition to performing in Britain, Compton appeared several times in the US, and toured Australia and New Zealand in a variety of stage plays.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Compton was born in Fulham, London, the sixth and youngest child and fourth daughter of Edward Compton (1854–1918), actor and manager (whose real surname was Mackenzie), and his wife, the actress Virginia Frances Bateman (1853–1940) daughter of the actor Hezekiah Linthicum Bateman, of Baltimore, US. One of her brothers became well known as the author Compton Mackenzie.

Compton made her first professional appearance in 1911 with the concert party &quot;The Follies&quot; under the leadership of H. G. Pelissier, her first husband, whom she married while still in her teens. The marriage was short-lived: Pelissier died in September 1913 at the age of 39, leaving his young widow with an infant son, who would become the producer and director Anthony Pelissier. In 1914, at Maidenhead, as Fay C. Pellissier, she married secondly the young singer Lauri de Frece. In 1914, she made the first of many appearances on the American stage, at the Shubert Theatre, New York, in &quot;To-Night&#x27;s the Night,&quot; subsequently touring in the same part. In London during the First World War she played a variety of roles, including the title role in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in 1917.

===1920s and 30s===

In 1921 she was the eponymous star of the play &quot;Mary Rose&quot; written especially for her by J. M. Barrie. This work was partly inspired by Compton&#x27;s own tragic marriage to the West End satirist H. G. Pélissier and her subsequent youthful widowhood. In the 1920s her parts included the first of many Shakespeare roles, Ophelia, to the Hamlet of John Barrymore. The critic James Agate wrote of her performance, &quot;She was fragrant, wistful, and had a child&#x27;s importunacy unmatched in my time.&quot; Compton&#x27;s second husband, the actor Lauri de Frece, died in 1921, aged 41, and in February 1922 she married Leon Quartermaine, with whom she had acted in a revival of Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Quality Street&quot;.

Compton had a reputation for versatility, and in 1931 she appeared successively in the title role of the pantomime &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; and Ophelia to Henry Ainley&#x27;s Hamlet. Throughout the 1930s Compton moved between West End plays, mostly ephemeral, pantomime and Shakespeare – Titania, Lady Rosaline, Calpurnia, and Paulina in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, one of her favourite parts – and toured in Australia and New Zealand in &quot;Victoria Regina&quot;, &quot;Tonight at 8.30&quot; and &quot;George and Margaret&quot;. In 1939 she played Ophelia to the Hamlet of John Gielgud, first at the Lyceum and then at Elsinore Castle.

In 1927 Compton opened an acting school in London, the Fay Compton Studio of Dramatic Art, which continued in business up to the start of World War II. Notable alumni included Alec Guinness and John Le Mesurier.

===1940s to 1960s===
During the 1940s Compton appeared at the Old Vic as Regan in &quot;King Lear&quot;, played Ruth in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; for 15 months, Regina in &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, toured for the British Council, in Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Switzerland, in &quot;Othello,&quot; &quot;Candida&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and made her first appearance in an Ibsen play as Gina Ekdal in &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;. Her third marriage was dissolved in 1942, and in that year she married the actor Ralph Michael; this marriage was dissolved in 1946. There were no children of Compton&#x27;s last three marriages.

In the 1950s Compton rejoined the Old Vic company, appearing at the 1953 Edinburgh Festival, as Gertrude in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and in London in the 1953–1954 season, as Gertrude; the Countess of Rossillion in &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;; Constance of Bretagne in &quot;King John&quot;; Volumnia in &quot;Coriolanus&quot;; and Juno in &quot;The Tempest&quot;. With the same company she played Queen Margaret in &quot;Richard III&quot; in 1957, to the Richard of Robert Helpmann, and Lady Bracknell in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; in 1959.

At the first Chichester Festival, from July to September 1962, Compton played Grausis in &quot;The Broken Heart&quot;, and Marya in &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;. Her other stage roles of the 1960s included Mrs Malaprop in &quot;The Rivals&quot;, and her last Barrie role, the Comtesse in &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot;.

Compton was awarded the CBE in 1975. She died on 12 December 1978 in London at the age of 84.

==Film and television==
Compton&#x27;s film work is not as well known as her stage appearances. She appeared in more than 40 films between 1914 and 1970. Her most popular performances in films are &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947), &quot;Laughter in Paradise&quot; (1951), Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Othello&quot; (1952), &quot;The Haunting&quot; (1963) and &quot;I Start Counting&quot; (1969).

Among her television performances, she appeared in 1965 with Michael Hordern in the television play &quot;Land of My Dreams&quot; by Clive Exton. Among her last major roles were Aunt Ann in the BBC&#x27;s 1967 television adaptation of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, and Mrs Brown the old rag dealer in a BBC adaptation of Dickens&#x27; &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; in 1969.

<text>The Shidduch (, pl. shidduchim , Aramaic shidduchin) is a system of matchmaking in which Jewish singles are introduced to one another in Orthodox Jewish communities for the purpose of marriage.

== The practice ==
In the past and until today in more conservative Orthodox Jewish circles, dating is limited to the search for a marriage partner. Both sides (usually the parents, close relatives or friends of the persons involved, and the singles themselves) make inquiries about the prospective partner (e.g., on his/her character, intelligence, level of learning, financial status, family and health status, appearance, and level of religious observance).

A &quot;shidduch&quot; often begins with a recommendation from family members, friends, or others who see matchmaking as a mitzvah, or commandment. Some engage in it as a profession and charge a fee for their services. Usually, a professional matchmaker is called a &quot;shadchan&quot;, but anyone who makes a &quot;shidduch&quot; is considered the &quot;shadchan&quot; for it.

After the match has been proposed, the prospective partners meet a number of times to gain a sense of whether they are right for one another. The number of dates prior to announcing an engagement may vary by community. In some, the dating continues several months. In stricter communities, the couple may decide a few days after originally meeting with each other. Also, the age when &quot;shidduchim&quot; start may vary by community. In frum circles, especially among Hasidim, eighteen is the age when &quot;shidduchim&quot; start and &quot;shadchanim&quot; take notice.

Those who support marriage by shidduch believe that it complies with traditional Judaism&#x27;s outlook on &quot;Tzniut&quot;, modest behaviour in relations between men and women, and prevents promiscuity. It may also be helpful in small Jewish communities where meeting prospective marriage partners is limited, and this gives them access to a broader spectrum of potential candidates.

If the shidduch does not succeed, the shadchan is usually contacted and tells the other side that the arrangement will not be going ahead. If the shidduch is successful, the couple informs the shadchan of its success.

In recent years, a number of shidduchim sites have appeared on the Internet.

== Bashow ==
The prospective partners either date each other, or, in stricter Haredi communities, they go to a &quot;bashow&quot;, or sit-in. The practice has been called &quot;a chaperoned quasi-date&quot;.

A typical &quot;bashow&quot; scene is that the young man, with his parents, goes to see the young woman in her house (or that of someone hosting), to see if the prospective couple are compatible. Both sets of parents talk to each other, and then, when the setting is more relaxed, they go into another room, leaving the man and woman in the living room to speak between themselves. Some use this opportunity to actually ask each other pertinent questions, while some just want to see if they like each other, relying more on the information they got from the &quot;shadchen&quot; or from other people. The number of &quot;bashow&quot;s prior to announcing an engagement varies, as some have many &quot;bashow&quot;s, while others have as few as one, which is typical among the children of Hasidic Rebbes.

== Bashert ==
&quot;Bashert&quot; (or &quot;beshert&quot;; Yiddish: ) means &quot;destiny&quot;.
(Compare Middle High German beschern: “to preordain, destine, allot, distribute”.
Compare also German &quot;beschert&quot;, meaning &quot;bestowed&quot; or &quot;given&quot;.
Others insist that it comes from the Yiddish &quot;sher&quot; meaning &quot;scissors&quot; or &quot;shears&quot;; this etymology is less likely.)
It is often used to refer to one&#x27;s divinely foreordained spouse or soulmate, who is called one&#x27;s &quot;basherte&quot; (female) or &quot;basherter&quot; (male). It can also be used to express the seeming fate or destiny of an auspicious or important event, friendship, or happening.

In modern usage, Jewish singles will say that they are looking for their &quot;bashert&quot;, meaning they are looking for that person who will complement them perfectly, and whom they will complement perfectly. Since it is considered to have been Heavenly foreordained whom one will marry, one&#x27;s spouse is considered to be one&#x27;s &quot;bashert&quot; by definition, independent of whether the couple&#x27;s marital life works out well or not.

=== Zivug ===

A somewhat related word is &quot;zivug&quot;. The word includes the letters for the Hebrew word &quot;zug&quot;, pair; the transliteration subsets/matches too. God has pleasure also with the Yichudim of Jewish couple: &quot;Shekhinah is present with union ... the &quot;wedding&quot;&quot;. All desire may be for God, and &quot;all pleasures come from &quot;divine spiritual source&quot;&quot;.

== Biblical matchmaking ==

The first recorded &quot;shidduch&quot; in the Torah was the match that Eliezer, the servant of the Jewish patriarch Abraham, made for his master&#x27;s son Isaac (Genesis Ch. 24). Abraham gave him specific instructions to choose a woman from Abraham&#x27;s own tribe. Eliezer traveled to his master&#x27;s homeland to fulfill Abraham&#x27;s wishes, arriving at a well. After a short prayer to God for guidance, describing how a virtuous woman might act toward a traveling stranger at the well, Rebekah appeared on the scene, and did everything described in Eliezer&#x27;s prayer. Eliezer then went with Rebekah to her family, and appealed to them for permission to take Rebekah back with him to be Isaac&#x27;s wife. Once this permission was granted, Rebekah joined Eliezer on the road home to Isaac. Even so, Isaac gained his own impression of her before agreeing to marry her (Rashi, commentary to Genesis 24:67).

However, when Eliezer proposes to take Rebekah back to Isaac in Canaan, he is told by Rebekah&#x27;s family: &quot;Let us ask the maiden&quot; (&quot;i. e.&quot;, Rebekah). This is taken as an instruction for Jewish parents to weigh their child&#x27;s opinion in the balance during an arranged marriage. Regardless of whether proper procedure is followed, this is not the end of the decision—it is believed by Jews that the final say belongs to God, who may have different plans (compare with the match of Jacob and Leah).

== Talmudic references ==
The Talmud (Bavli Kiddushin 12a, first version) states that academy head Abba Arikha would give corporal punishment to a man who would marry without &quot;shidduchin&quot;, that is, without prearrangement by the couple. The text gives three versions of his practice; the other two versions disagree. Some authorities rule according to the first version, while others rule according to the other two versions.

In Kiddushin 41a, it states that a man should not marry a woman he has not seen, lest he come to violate &quot;love your neighbour as yourself&quot;.

The etymology of the words &quot;shidduch&quot; and &quot;shadchan&quot; is uncertain. The medieval rabbi Nissim of Gerona (commonly called &quot;Ran&quot;) traces it to the Aramaic word for &quot;calm&quot; (cf. Targum to the Book of Judges 5:31), and elaborates that the main purpose of the &quot;shidduch&quot; process is for young people to &quot;settle down&quot; into marriage. According to Jastrow, the word means to &quot;negotiate&quot; or &quot;stipulate&quot; (the financial terms of a betrothal).

== Shadchan ==
 (, plural , female , is a Hebrew word for matchmaker; Yiddish: Shadkhn.

The word refers to people who carry out as a profession within the religious Jewish community. However, can also be used to refer to anyone who introduces two single Jews to one another with the hope that they will form a couple.

One of the characters in the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; is a matchmaker named Yente. Because of this, the name () is sometimes mistakenly taken to be a synonym for .

=== Shadchanus gelt ===
 () is the money (, ) paid to the party/parties who brokered a successful pairing. It is a brokerage fee, not a gift, and can&#x27;t be paid from funds intended for charity ( ). Usually it is paid by the parents, and it is common that each pays an equal amount.

==Bat-Kohen ==

Although Torah law allows for a bat-kohen to marry a &quot;challal&quot;, convert, or freed slave (Hebrew &quot;eved meshukhrar&quot;), the Midrash and Talmud cite Johanan bar Nappaha&#x27;s view that a daughter of the kohen is best off marrying a kohen. Rabbi Yochanan maintains that in the event a &quot;bat-kohen&quot; marries a non-Kohen, undesired results for the groom are likely to surface, such as poverty or the demise of the groom. An exception to this taboo is if the groom is a &quot;Talmid Chacham&quot;.

== Medical aspects ==

Considering the prevalence of a number of genetic diseases in both the Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities, several organisations (most notably Dor Yeshorim) routinely screen large groups of young people anonymously, only handing them a telephone number and a PIN. When a &quot;shidduch&quot; is suggested, the candidates can phone the organisation, enter both their PINs, and find out whether their union could result in critically disabled children. Although the implementation has been controversial, there has been a sharp decrease in the number of children born with Tay–Sachs disease and other genetic disorders since its inception.

<doc id="558101" wikidata="Q36880" url="?curid=558101" title="Bulgar language">
<text>Bulgar (also known as Bulghar, Bolgar, or Bolghar) is an extinct Oghur Turkic language spoken by the Bulgars.

The name is derived from the Bulgars, a tribal association that established the Bulgar state known as Old Great Bulgaria in the mid-7th century, giving rise to the Danubian Bulgaria by the 680s. While the language initially went extinct in Danubian Bulgaria (in favour of Old Bulgarian), it persisted in Volga Bulgaria, but even there it was eventually replaced by the modern Chuvash language. Other than Chuvash, Bulgar is the only language to be definitively classified as an Oghur Turkic language.

The inclusion of other languages such as Hunnish, Khazar and Sabir within Oghur Turkic remains speculative owing to the paucity of historical records. Some scholars suggest Hunnish had strong ties with Bulgar and to modern Chuvash and refer to this extended grouping as separate Hunno-Bulgar languages. However, such speculations are not based on proper linguistic evidence, since the language of the Huns is almost unknown except for a few attested words, which are Indo-European in origin, and personal names. Thus, scholars generally consider Hunnish as unclassifiable.

==Affiliation==
Mainstream scholarship places Bulgar among the &quot;Lir&quot; branch of Turkic languages referred to as Oghur Turkic, Lir-Turkic or, indeed, &quot;Bulgar Turkic&quot;, as opposed to the &quot;Shaz&quot;-type of Common Turkic. The &quot;Lir&quot; branch is characterized by sound correspondences such as Oghuric /r/ versus Common Turkic (or Shaz-Turkic) /z/ and Oghuric /l/ versus Common Turkic (Shaz-Turkic) /š/. As was stated by Al-Istakhri (c. 10 century CE), &quot;The language of the Khazars is different than the language of the Turks and the Persians, nor does a tongue of (any) group of humanity have anything in common with it and the language of the Bulgars is like the language of the Khazars, but the Burtas have another language.&quot;

The only surviving language from this linguistic group is Chuvash. He concludes that the language of the Bulgars was from the family of the &quot;Hunnic languages&quot;, as he calls the Oghur languages. According to the Bulgarian Antoaneta Granberg, the Hunno-Bulgar linguistic situation is further complicated by the extensive migration of nomadic communities of Hunnic and Oghuric peoples from East to West. This migration brought them into contact with a variety of different lands, neighbors, cultures, and languages, including China and Rome. Linguistic individuation of the Hunno-Bulgaric language family has yet to be conclusively established. A Hunno-Bulgar language is believed to have formed on the North-Western borders of China in the 3rd-5th c. BC.

==Danubian Bulgar==
The language of the Danube Bulgars (or &quot;Danubian Bulgar&quot;) is recorded in a small number of inscriptions, which are found in Pliska, the first capital of First Bulgarian Empire, and in the rock churches near the town of Murfatlar, in present-day Romania. Some of these inscriptions are written in the Greek characters, others in the Kuban alphabet which is a variant of Orkhon script. Most of these appear to have been of a private character (oaths, dedications, inscriptions on grave stones) and some were court inventories. Although attempts at decipherment have been made, none of them has gained wide acceptance. These inscriptions in Danubian Bulgar are found along with other, official ones written in Greek; which was used as the official state language of the First Bulgarian Empire until the end of the ninth century, when it was replaced by the Old Church Slavonic, (also called Old Bulgarian).

The language of the Danubian Bulgars is also known from a small number of loanwords in the Old Bulgarian language, as well as terms occurring in Bulgar Greek-language inscriptions, contemporary Byzantine texts, and later Slavonic Old Bulgarian texts. Most of these words designate titles and other concepts concerning the affairs of state, including the official 12-year cyclic calendar (as used in the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans). The language became extinct in Danubian Bulgaria in the ninth century as the Bulgar nobility became gradually Slavicized after the Old Bulgarian tongue was declared as official in 893.
=== Phonology ===
Unlike Volga Bulgarian and Chuvash, d&#x27;ization is seen in the sounds at the beginning of words. Talât Tekin argues that this sound corresponds to the initial &quot;gy&quot; sound in Hungarian and is pronounced close to it.
==Volga Bulgar==
The language spoken by the population of Volga Bulgaria is known as &quot;Volga-Bulgar&quot;. There are a number of surviving inscriptions in Volga-Bulgar, some of which are written with Arabic letters, alongside the continuing use of Orkhon script. These are all largely decipherable. That language persisted until the 13th or the 14th century. In that region, it may have ultimately given rise to the Chuvash language, which is most closely related to it and which is classified as the only surviving member of a separate &quot;Oghur-Turkic&quot; (or Lir-Turkic) branch of the Turkic languages, to which Bulgar is also considered to have belonged (see above). Still, the precise position of Chuvash within the Oghur family of languages is a matter of dispute among linguists. Since the comparative material attributable to the extinct members of Oghuric (Khazar and Bulgar) is scant, little is known about any precise interrelation of these languages and it is a matter of dispute whether Chuvash, the only &quot;Lir&quot;-type language with sufficient extant linguistic material, might be the daughter language of any of these or just a sister branch.

<text>Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester, KG, Earl Marshal (c. 1550 – 3 March 1628) was an English aristocrat. He was an important advisor to King James I (James VI of Scots), serving as Lord Privy Seal.

== Career ==
He was the only son of three children born to the 3rd Earl of Worcester and Christiana North. On 21 February 1589, he succeeded his father as Earl of Worcester.

In June 1590 Worcester travelled to Edinburgh to congratulate James VI of Scotland on his safe return from Denmark and marriage to Anne of Denmark, and gave notice that the king was to join the Order of the Garter. He discussed with James rumours that English ships had lain in wait for his return. At first, he was not able to see Anne of Denmark who had toothache, and he joked that in England this would be interpreted as a sign she was pregnant. Worcester had an audience with Anne, and took her letter to Elizabeth. He was accompanied by Lord Compton who watched &#x27;pastimes&#x27; or hunting on the sands of Leith.

In 1593 he was made a Knight of the Garter. In a letter of September 1602 he mentions that Queen Elizabeth was entertained in the Privy Chamber with country dances and Irish tunes.

The Earl of Worcester was Master of the Horse to Elizabeth I, and Master of Anne of Denmark&#x27;s household. He wrote a letter describing the formation of the queen&#x27;s household in 1604 which is frequently quoted by historians. In 1606 he was appointed Keeper of the Great Park, a park created for hunting by Henry VIII around Nonsuch Palace, of which Worcester Park was a part. The residence Worcester Park House was built in 1607.

==Family==

He married Lady Elizabeth Hastings on 16 December 1571 at Whitehall Palace in a triple wedding with Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford and bride, Anne Cecil, and Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley and bride, Mary Howard. She was a daughter of Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon and Catherine Pole. Catherine was a daughter of Henry Pole, 1st Baron Montagu and Jane Neville. Jane was in turn a daughter of George Nevill, 4th Baron Bergavenny and his wife Margaret, daughter of Hugh Fenn. They had fifteen children among whom were: 
*William Somerset, born before 20 Apr 1576, died 1597/98. Edward&#x27;s eldest son, preceded his father unmarried and without issue.
*Henry Somerset, 5th Earl of Worcester, his heir and successor, who was later created the 1st Marquess of Worcester;
*Thomas Somerset, 1st Viscount Somerset (Peerage of Ireland), who was born in 1579, died in 1649; he was created &quot;Viscount Somerset&quot; on 8 December 1626; in 1616 he married Helen Barry – her third marriage -, with whom he had one daughter:
**Elizabeth Somerset, who might have died young, but that is unsure;
*Lady Anne Somerset, who married Sir Edward Wynter (als Wyntour) of Lydney, Gloucestershire, on 11 August 1595.
*Lady Catherine or Katherine Somerset, who died on 6 November 1654 and, before 14 January 1607, married Thomas Windsor, 6th Baron Windsor, with whom she had no issue; and
*Lady Blanche Somerset, who died 28 October 1649, and married Thomas Arundell, 2nd Baron Arundell of Wardour, with whom she had one son and two daughters, his only children; the settlement for this marriage was on 11 May 1607.
*Lady Frances Somerset, wife of William Morgan, esquire of Llantarnam and mother of Edward Morgan (c. 1612 – 24 June 1653), who was the great-great grandfather of Daniel Boone.
* Sir Charles Somerset (1587/8 – 1665), traveller and writer, Knight of the Bath, who married Elizabeth Powell in February 1609.
* Lady Elizabeth Somerset, married Sir Henry Guildford.
* Lady Katherine Somerset (1575-1624), married William Petre, 2nd Baron Petre.

Four of his daughters danced as the rivers of Monmouthshire in the court masque &quot;Tethys&#x27; Festival&quot; on 5 June 1610; Lady Catherine Windsor as the &quot;Nymph of Usk&quot;; Lady Katherine Petre as the &quot;Nymph of Olwy&quot;; Lady Elizabeth Guildford as the &quot;Nymph of Dulesse&quot;; and Lady Mary Wintour as the &quot;Nymph of Wye&quot;.

Somerset is buried in the family chapel in the Church of St Cadoc, Raglan, Monmouthshire

<text>Jeremiah Clarke (c. 1674 – 1 December 1707) was an English baroque composer and organist, best known for his &quot;Trumpet Voluntary,&quot; a popular piece often played at wedding ceremonies or commencement ceremonies.

==Biography==
The exact date of Clarke&#x27;s birth has been debated. The &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; states that Clarke &quot;is said to have been born in 1669 (though probably the date should be earlier).&quot; Most sources say that he is thought to have been born in London around 1674.

Clarke was one of the pupils of John Blow at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and a chorister in 1685 at the Chapel Royal. Between 1692 and 1695 he was an organist at Winchester College, then between 1699 and 1704 he was an organist at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He later became an organist and &#x27;Gentleman extraordinary&#x27; at the Chapel Royal, he shared that post with fellow composer William Croft, his friend. They were succeeded by John Blow.

Today, Clarke is best remembered for a popular keyboard piece that was originally either a harpsichord piece or a work for wind ensemble: the &quot;Prince of Denmark&#x27;s March&quot;, which is commonly called the &quot;Trumpet Voluntary&quot;, written in about 1700. From c. 1878 until the 1940s the work was attributed to Henry Purcell, and was published as &quot;Trumpet Voluntary by Henry Purcell&quot; in William Spark&#x27;s &quot;Short Pieces for the Organ, Book VII, No. 1&quot; (London, Ashdown and Parry). This version came to the attention of Sir Henry J. Wood, who made two orchestral transcriptions of it, both of which were recorded. The recordings further cemented the erroneous notion that the original piece was by Purcell. Clarke&#x27;s piece is a popular choice for wedding music, and has been used in royal weddings.

The famous &quot;Trumpet Tune in D&quot; (also incorrectly attributed to Purcell) was taken from the semi-opera &quot;The Island Princess&quot; (1699), which was a joint musical production of Clarke and Daniel Purcell (Henry Purcell&#x27;s younger brother or cousin)—probably leading to the confusion.

==Clarke&#x27;s suicide==
&quot;A violent and hopeless passion for a very beautiful lady of a rank superior to his own&quot; caused Clarke to commit suicide. Apparently, he fell madly in love with one of his female students, a young, beautiful woman, of much higher social rank than himself. The woman was out of his league in every way, and he could not bear it. He thus decided that life was not worth living.

Clarke had been visiting a friend who lived in the countryside. He abruptly determined to leave and return to London. His friend observed his dejection, and disappointment in love, and furnished him with a horse and a servant to take care of him. While riding near London, a fit of melancholy seized him on the road and he alighted, giving the horse to the servant. He went into a field, where there was a pond surrounded by trees, and stood on the bank. He began debating with himself about whether he should drown himself in the pond or hang himself on the trees. To decide his fate, he tossed a coin in the water. The coin fell with its edge embedded in the clay, so Clarke mounted his horse, returned to London, and went back to his home in the churchyard of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Instead of consoling himself, he chose another method of suicide, shooting himself in the head with a pistol.

Suicides were not generally granted burial in consecrated ground, but an exception was made for Clarke, who was buried in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, although other sources state he was buried in the unconsecrated section of the cathedral churchyard.

=== Controversy ===
Like his date of birth, the account of his death has also been debated in some sources. For example, the story of the composer&#x27;s suicide is contradicted by a contemporary broadsheet which seems to have escaped the notice of his biographers. It is a large single sheet, entitled &quot;A Sad and Dismal Account of the Sudden and Untimely Death of Mr. Jeremiah Clark, one of the Queen&#x27;s Organists, who Shot himself in the Head with a Screw Pistol, at the Golden Cup in St. Paul&#x27;s-Church-Yard, on Monday Morning last, for the supposed Love of a Young Woman, near Pater-noster-Row&quot;. That account states that Clarke, a bachelor with a salary of over 300/- a year, about nine o&#x27;clock &quot;Monday morning last&quot; was visited by his father and some friends, &quot;at which he seem&#x27;d to be very Chearful and Merry, by Playing on his Musick for a considerable time, which was a Pair of Organs in his own House, which he took great Delight in&quot; and, after his father had gone, returned to his room. Between ten and eleven o&#x27;clock, his maid-servant heard a pistol go off and, running in, found that he had shot himself behind the ear. Clarke died the same day about three o&#x27;clock. &quot;The Occasion ... is variously Discours&#x27;d; some will have it that his Sister marrying his Scholar [Charles King], who he fear&#x27;d might in time prove a Rival in his Business, threw him into a kind of melancholy Discontent; and others (with something more Reason) impute this Misfortune to a young Married Woman near Pater-Noster-Row, whom he had a more than ordinary respect for, who not returning him such suitable Favours as his former Affections , might in a great Measure occasion dismal Effects.&quot;

Curious discrepancies exist as to the exact date of Clarke&#x27;s suicide. While most sources give the date as 1 December 1707, music historian Charles Burney, followed by François-Joseph Fétis, says that the event took place on 16 July 1707. The first edition of John Hawkins fixes it as happening on 5 November 1707, which has been followed by Arthur Mendel, David Baptie, and Brown. However, Hawkins left a copy of his &quot;History&quot;, in which he had made numerous corrections and, in that, the date appears as 1 December 1707, which is given in the 1853 edition of the work. There is an entry in the Chapel Royal Cheque Book, signed by the sub-dean, to the effect that, on 5 November 1707, Croft was admitted into the organist&#x27;s place, &quot;now become void by the death of Mr. Jeremiah Clerk&quot;, and in Barrett&#x27;s &quot;English Church Composers&quot; (p. 106) is a statement that the books of the vicars-choral of St. Paul&#x27;s contain an entry to the effect that &quot;on November ye first, Mr. Jerry Clarke deceased this life&quot;. These various accounts seem irreconcilable, but the following facts throw some light on the subject:
# In 1707, 5 November was a Wednesday, 1 November a Saturday, and 1 December a Monday. The latter date tallies with the broadsheet account, published within a week of the event by John Johnson, &quot;near Stationers&#x27; Hall&quot;, and therefore close to Clarke&#x27;s house, though no entry of the exact date of publication can be found at Stationers&#x27; Hall.
# The burial register of St Gregory by St Paul&#x27;s records the burial of Jeremiah Clarke on 3 December 1707.
# Administration to his goods was granted by the dean and chapter of St. Paul&#x27;s to his sister, Ann King, on 15 December.
# The entry in the Chapel Royal Cheque Book was probably not made at the time, and so November might easily have been written instead of December. The order of the entries preceding and following it are: 28 January 1703, 24 March 1710–11, 25 May 1704, 5 November 1707, 12 June 1708. As well, the entry is not witnessed. With regard to the quotation from the records at St. Paul&#x27;s, everything points to its being either a mistake or a misprint. Unfortunately, it is impossible to verify the statement, part of the vicars-choral records being inaccessible.

<doc id="558123" wikidata="Q1283332" url="?curid=558123" title="Earl of Worcester">
<text>Earl of Worcester is a title that has been created five times in the Peerage of England. Worcester is a cathedral city in Worcestershire, England.

== Five creations ==
The first creation came in 1138 in favour of the Norman noble Waleran de Beaumont. He was the son of Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, by Elizabeth of Vermandois, and the twin brother of Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester. Like his father and brother he also held the title Count of Meulan in the French nobility. The earldom of Worcester apparently became extinct on his death in 1166.

The second creation came in 1397 in favour of the military commander and governor Thomas Percy. He was a younger son of Henry de Percy, 3rd Baron Percy, and Mary of Lancaster, and the brother of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. He fought in the Hundred Years&#x27; War for Richard II, against whom he later rebelled. After the Battle of Shrewsbury, he was beheaded for treason and his honours forfeit, although he was without issue anyway.

The third creation came in 1420 in favour of Richard Beauchamp, 2nd Baron Bergavenny. He was the son of William de Beauchamp, younger son of Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick and Katherine Mortimer. William de Beauchamp was summoned to Parliament as &quot;Willilmo Beauchamp de Bergavenny&quot; on 23 July 1392, by which he is held to have become Baron Bergavenny. The earldom of Worcester became extinct on the death of its first holder in 1422, while the barony was passed on to his daughter and only child, Elizabeth. See Baron Bergavenny for further history of this title.

The fourth creation came in 1449 in favour of John Tiptoft, 2nd Baron Tiptoft, a noted scholar and sometime favourite of Edward IV. After the Lancastrians were restored to power under Henry VI, Worcester was captured and beheaded, with his titles forfeited. However, they were restored the following year in favour of his second and only surviving son Edward. Edward died at an early age in 1486. On his death the earldom became extinct while the barony became either extinct or fell into abeyance between his aunts. The barony of Tiptoft had been created on 7 January 1426 when the first Earl&#x27;s father, John Tiptoft, was summoned to Parliament. He had previously served as Speaker of the House of Commons and Lord High Treasurer.

The fifth creation came in 1514 in favour of Charles Somerset, the legitimised son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset. The fifth Earl was made Marquess of Worcester in 1643 and the third Marquess Duke of Beaufort in 1682. See the latter title for more information on this creation.

<doc id="558130" wikidata="Q1935669" url="?curid=558130" title="Sonic Flower Groove">
<text>Sonic Flower Groove is the debut studio album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream, released on 5 October 1987 by Elevation Records. Mayo Thompson of Red Krayola was the producer of the album, after work with Stephen Street did not please the band. Musically, &quot;Sonic Flower Groove&quot; features psychedelic, Byrdsy jangle pop, being the only Primal Scream album to feature founding member Jim Beattie (credited as Jim Navajo).

The album sold well enough to reach number 62 on the UK Albums Chart, but performed poorly by major-label standards. The disappointment was a major reason for the original Primal Scream splitting up shortly after &quot;Sonic Flower Groove&quot;, leaving vocalist Bobby Gillespie and the guitar duo of Andrew Innes and Robert &quot;Throb&quot; Young to reorganize the band.

==Critical reception==

At the time of its release, critical reception was mixed. &quot;Underground&quot; called it &quot;a real gem of a debut album&quot; and &quot;one that&#x27;s sure to top all the polls come the end of the year&quot;, but others were less impressed. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; were impressed with &quot;Gentle Tuesday&quot; but said &quot;the rest is not pop. It is dandelion fluff&quot;, stating that the album was &quot;swamped with problems&quot; with &quot;no songs, just a dusty pile of dull leftovers&quot;.

A later AllMusic review called it &quot;one goofy headscratcher of a release, the sound of a band that didn&#x27;t quite know exactly what to do yet trying to record a big-budget (of sorts) debut album and ending up with little more than a pristine but dull photocopy of &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot;&quot;. In 2002, the &quot;Evening Times&quot; stated that it is &quot;now regarded as a retro masterpiece&quot;.

<doc id="558137" wikidata="Q559672" url="?curid=558137" title="Albert Zafy">
<text>Albert Zafy (1 May 1927 – 13 October 2017) was a Malagasy politician and educator who served as the fourth President of Madagascar from 1993 to 1996. In 1988, he founded the National Union for Democracy and Development (UNDD).

In 1992, Zafy stood as a presidential candidate against President Didier Ratsiraka. The election soon became a run-off between the two candidates. In 1993, Zafy won the run-off election in a landslide, receiving 67% of the vote. During his presidency, Zafy received poor polling numbers due to an economic decline with accusations of corruption in his office. He was impeached in 1996 and then defeated by Ratsiraka in the 1996 presidential election. After leaving office, Zafy remained active in politics as an opposition leader under successive administrations.

==Early life and early career==
Zafy was born in Ambilobe, Diana Region on 1 May 1927. He studied at the University of Montpellier in France. After his return to Madagascar he became Minister of Public Health and Social Affairs under Gabriel Ramanantsoa. After Didier Ratsiraka took power in 1975, Zafy resigned from the government and joined the University of Madagascar.

==Early political career==
===Opposition leader in the early 1990s===
In 1988 he founded the National Union for Democracy and Development (UNDD). At a national conference of the opposition in 1990, Zafy was elected as President of the Committee of Active Forces (CFV), a cooperation group of several opposition parties, including Zafy&#x27;s UNDD. On 16 July 1991, the CFV declared the creation of an alternative government, with Zafy as its Prime Minister. Zafy was detained for a week in late July 1991 and was met with a crowd of about 100,000 supporters upon his release. He was subsequently wounded during a protest. The opposition was ultimately successful in forcing Ratsiraka to agree to the Panorama Convention, which established a transitional government and stripped Ratsiraka of most of his powers, on 31 October 1991. Zafy oversaw the transition as head of the High Authority of the State, which, along with the Social and Economic Recovery Council, replaced the Supreme Revolutionary Council and the National Assembly during the 1991–1993 transitional period.

==First Presidential run==

In the multiparty presidential election held in November 1992, Zafy came first in the first round with about 45% of the vote; Ratsiraka placed second with about 29%. In the second round, held on 10 February 1993, Zafy won the presidency with 66.74% of the vote. He took office in late March–the first time since Madagascar&#x27;s independence in 1960 that an incumbent president peacefully transferred power to an elected member of the opposition. In June 1993, Zafy&#x27;s supporters won a majority in parliamentary elections.

==Presidency (1991–1996)==
===Tenure===
In office, Zafy&#x27;s rivalry with Prime Minister Francisque Ravony led him to seek increased powers, and in September 1995 a successful referendum was held that substantially increased the powers of the president. This gave him authority over the selection of the prime minister, a decision that was previously in the hands of the National Assembly; following the referendum, the National Assembly was required to send three names of candidates to the president, from which he could choose.

The president also gained the ability to dismiss the prime minister without requiring new elections. Ravony resigned in October 1995, and Zafy appointed Emmanuel Rakotovahiny, who was the head of the UNDD and had been Minister of State for Rural Development and Land Reform, in his place.

Zafy&#x27;s time in office was widely seen as being marked by economic decline, which negatively impacted his popularity, and amid accusations of corruption and abuse of power, he was impeached by the National Assembly on 26 July 1996. The impeachment was backed by more than the necessary two-thirds majority; out of 134 deputies present, 99 voted in favor of the motion, 32 against it, and there were three null votes. On 4 September, the High Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment. On 5 September, Zafy announced that he would leave office on 10 October, and he described his impeachment as a &quot;constitutional &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;&quot; that occurred as a result of his criticism of the National Assembly. Although he could not delay his departure from office, he was able to stand as a candidate in the late 1996 presidential election called as a result of his impeachment.

===1996 re-election bid and defeat===

In his 1996 campaign, Zafy blamed the problems faced by Madagascar during his presidency on his opponents and the International Monetary Fund, and he downplayed the charges against him that had led to his impeachment. Although he had lost much of his support, in the first round of the election, held on 3 November, he was able to take second place with 23.39% of the vote, behind Ratsiraka&#x27;s 36.61%. Zafy received some support in the second round from those who, despite their criticisms of Zafy, felt he was preferable to Ratsiraka, such as Interim President Norbert Ratsirahonana, who had unsuccessfully stood as a candidate in the first round. In the second round, held on 29 December, Zafy narrowly lost to Ratsiraka, taking 49.29% of the vote and losing by about 45,000 votes. He later alleged that the High Constitutional Court had switched the numbers for himself and Ratsiraka and said that he had not spoken of that at the time for the sake of peace.

==Post-presidency (1997–2017)==
===Opposition leader under Ratsiraka===
Zafy led an attempt to impeach Ratsiraka in early 1998, accusing him of various charges, including perjury and nepotism; he also accused Ratsiraka of violating the constitution in his moves toward decentralization and the strengthening of the presidency at the expense of the National Assembly&#x27;s power. The impeachment motion failed in the National Assembly on 4 February 1998 when only 60 deputies voted in favor of it, well short of the necessary 92. Zafy subsequently won a seat in the May 1998 parliamentary election, becoming the oldest deputy in the National Assembly. He also unsuccessfully sought the secession of Antsiranana Province from Madagascar at around the same time.

On 31 August 2001, Zafy announced that he would again run in the December 2001 presidential election. On that occasion, he placed a distant third with about 5% of the vote. Opposition candidate Marc Ravalomanana prevailed in an extended dispute with Ratsiraka over the election results, and Ratsiraka fled into exile.

===Opposition leader under Ravalomanana===
Zafy became the leader of the National Reconciliation Committee (CRN), which was founded in June 2002 to promote national reconciliation among the leading participants in the political crisis that followed the 2001 election. During Ravalomanana&#x27;s presidency, Zafy and the CRN were viewed as part of the radical opposition in Madagascar. Zafy strongly criticized Ravalomanana and called for a new constitution. A grenade exploded outside Zafy&#x27;s home early on 8 July 2004, causing some damage but no injuries. This occurred in the midst of a series of grenade attacks across the country.

On 8 December 2006, Zafy&#x27;s property was raided by police as part of the government&#x27;s investigation regarding General Fidy, who allegedly attempted a coup in November, and presidential candidate Pety Rakotoniaina, both of whom the police sought to locate and arrest. Reacting to the raid, Zafy said that he did not recognize Ravalomanana as president and had never recognized him as such. Zafy travelled to Paris in June 2007, where he met with Ratsiraka and members of his former government who were also in exile. He met with Ratsiraka on 8 June, with AREMA leader Pierrot Rajaonarivelo on 9 June, and with Tantely Andrianarivo, who served as Prime Minister under Ratsiraka, on 11 June. He met with Ratsiraka and Andrianarivo again on 25 June.

===Role in 2009–2010 political events===
President Ravalomanana was forced out of office through popular protests and military intervention in March 2009; opposition leader Andry Rajoelina assumed the presidency with support from the military. Rajoelina included Zafy&#x27;s adviser Betiana Bruno as one of 44 members of the High Transitional Authority, which he appointed on 31 March 2009. Zafy expressed his objections to the transitional government at a press conference on 1 April, complaining that Rajoelina would not take his advice; he also said that he would seek provincial autonomy. Bruno was nevertheless present at the national conference which began on 2 April and was promoted by Rajoelina&#x27;s government.

On 4 August 2009, as part of negotiations for a solution to the political crisis, Zafy met with Rajoelina, Ravalomanana, and Ratsiraka, along with former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, who acted as mediator at the four-day-long mediation crisis talks held in Maputo. An extended process of negotiations between the four leaders resulted in a power-sharing agreement, but by December 2009 that agreement had effectively collapsed. Rajoelina&#x27;s government initially barred Zafy and others from returning to Madagascar after the talks, but later he was allowed to return. In the wake of the power-sharing agreement&#x27;s collapse, Zafy declared on 18 December 2009, that the opposition would form its own government of national unity. He denounced Rajoelina, saying that Rajoelina had &quot;reneged on his signature&quot; and that the opposition could &quot;no longer trust him to run the country&quot;. He also called on the army to refrain from involvement in the political situation.

===Personal life and death===
Zafy died of a stroke on 13 October 2017 at a hospital in Saint-Pierre in the French overseas department of Réunion at the age of 90.

<text>Malcolm Mitchell Young (6 January 1953 – 18 November 2017) was an Australian musician who was the rhythm guitarist, backing vocalist and a founding member of the hard rock band AC/DC. Except for a brief absence in 1988, he was a member of AC/DC from its inception in 1973 until retiring in 2014 for health reasons. As a member of AC/DC, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Young as the 38th best guitarist of all time along with his younger brother and fellow AC/DC member Angus Young.

Though Angus was the more visible of the brothers, Malcolm was described as the driving force and the leader of the band. In 2014, Young stated that despite his retirement from the band, AC/DC was determined to continue making music with his blessing.

Young left AC/DC in mid-2014 to receive treatment for dementia. In September 2014, the band&#x27;s management announced that he would be retiring permanently. He died from the effects of dementia on 18 November 2017.

== Early life ==
Malcolm Mitchell Young was born on 6 January 1953 in Glasgow, Scotland. Young&#x27;s father, William Young (1911–1985), lived with his family at 6 Skerryvore Road in the Cranhill district of Glasgow. William worked first as a wheel boy in a rope works and then as a machine and saw operator in an asbestos and cement business. In 1940, he joined the Royal Air Force and served in World War II as a flight engine mechanic. After the war, he worked as a yard man for a builder and then as a postman. He married Margaret (1913–1988; maiden name also Young), who was a housewife.

The &quot;big freeze&quot; of 1963 was one of the worst winters on record in Scotland, with snow deep. A TV advertisement shown in Scotland at that time offered assisted travel for families to start a different life in Australia. Fifteen members of the Young family left Scotland in late June 1963, including fifth son George (1946–2017) and younger brothers Malcolm and Angus (b. 1955). Also in tow were his eldest brother Stephen (1933–1989), his only sister Margaret Horsburgh (1935–2019) and brother William Jr (b. 1940). Another elder brother, Alex (1938–1997), who was a member of Tony Sheridan&#x27;s backup group The Bobby Patrick Big Six, stayed in Europe and was later a member of London-based group Grapefruit. Another brother, John (b. 1937), had migrated to Australia separately.

Malcolm later detailed the family&#x27;s musical background: &quot;All the males in our family played, Stevie, the oldest played accordion, Alex and John were the first couple to play guitar, and being older it was sort of passed down to George, then myself, then Angus.&quot; Initially staying at Villawood Migrant Hostel (a site later turned into Villawood Immigration Detention Centre) in Nissen huts, George met and became friends with another migrant, Harry Vanda. The Young family then moved into a semi-detached house at 4 Burleigh Street in the Sydney suburb of Burwood.

== Career ==
Both Angus and Malcolm Young were in a band with their brother George and his music partner Harry Vanda called Marcus Hook Roll Band. The project released an album in Australia called &quot;Tales of Old Grand-Daddy&quot;. Malcolm Young played guitar on the 1974 release &quot;Evie&quot; by Stevie Wright, written and produced by Vanda and Young. The song is 11 minutes long and has three parts. Young played the guitar solo in Part One of the song. Malcolm Young was in a short lived Newcastle-based band The Velvet Underground (not the well-known 1960s band).

Malcolm Young was 20 when he and younger brother Angus formed AC/DC in 1973. Angus was on lead guitar, Malcolm on rhythm guitar, Colin Burgess on drums, Larry Van Kriedt on bass guitar and Dave Evans on vocals. &quot;Can I Sit Next To You Girl&quot;, their first single, was later re-recorded with Bon Scott as their vocalist. They decided upon the name AC/DC after seeing the letters &quot;AC/DC&quot; on the back of their sister Margaret&#x27;s sewing machine. In 1975 AC/DC had moved to Melbourne.

In early 1977 they returned to Britain and began a European tour with Black Sabbath. While Bon Scott and Ozzy Osbourne quickly became friends, some other members of the two bands did not get on so well. In one incident, Young alleged that Geezer Butler pulled a knife on him, although Butler has since refuted that.

Towards the end of 1977, bassist Mark Evans was fired; Evans cited disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor. He was replaced by Cliff Williams.

In 1988, Young missed the majority of AC/DC&#x27;s Blow Up Your Video World Tour to address alcohol abuse issues. He eventually became sober and returned to the band. During his absence he was replaced by his nephew, Stevie Young.

Playing guitar in AC/DC from 1973 until his last live gig with the band in June 2010, Malcolm Young toured the world with few breaks on a 37-year run with the band. He continued to write songs in AC/DC until he left the band in 2014, being replaced once again by his nephew Stevie.

During production of their album &quot;Power Up,&quot; a source inside the band leaked that they were working with tracks from as far back as 2003 that Malcolm had recorded.

=== History with Gretsch Guitars ===

Malcolm Young owned and played several guitars throughout his career with AC/DC, however, he is most commonly known for his use of Gretsch guitars:
*1963 Gretsch Jet Firebird – This is his very first Gretsch 6131 which became known as &quot;The Beast&quot;. This guitar was heavily modified between 1976 and 1978. During this time, Malcolm removed the neck FilterTron and middle Gibson PAF, leaving only a rewound bridge FilterTron, the firebird red finish was removed and a matt clear lacquer was applied, he also removed the Burns vibrato unit and Space-Control bridge and installed a Badass wraparound bridge. Some time during 1988 during Malcolm&#x27;s absence from the Blow Up Your Video tour, the guitar was refinished in a yellow lacquer and the Badass was replaced with a Schaller 455 wraparound bridge. In 1996 he removed the Schaller bridge and reinstalled a Burns vibrato and Space-Control bridge, the bridge pickup ring was also removed, The Beast has not been modified since.
*1963 Gretsch Jet Firebird #2 – This guitar was used extensively over Malcolm&#x27;s career as his number 2 guitar. This guitar, like The Beast, started life as a standard 1963 Jet Firebird finished in Firebird red, the finish was stripped and a clear satin lacquer was applied, a middle pickup cavity was also cut to accompany the removal of the neck pickup to mimic the number 1 guitar. Malcolm also rewired the guitar much simpler than The Beast, leaving only the bridge pickup and volume pot connected to the output jack. This guitar also has a Burns vibrato unit along with an Adjusto-Matic bridge. The guitar also features black hole plugs instead of silver as is seen on The Beast. Stevie Young presently has possession of this guitar as his number 1.
*Gretsch Jet Firebird with Burns Vibrato, black, left-handed, year unknown - This guitar was rewired into a right-handed configuration similar to Malcolm&#x27;s other guitars, with the neck pickup, pickup selector, and tone control removed. This guitar was given to Stevie Young, and was his main recording and stage guitar with Starfighters in the early 1980s. This guitar is currently his number 2 stage guitar with AC/DC.
*JayDee Jet &quot;White Arrow&quot; – This guitar was made for Mal some time around 1977/78 and was seen most prominently during the Powerage and Highway to Hell tours. It was originally fitted with two FilterTron pickups and a wraparound bridge, however Malcolm later installed a Gibson tune-o-matic bridge and tailpiece, removed the neck pickup and filled the switch and wraparound bridge holes. Stevie Young also has possession of this guitar as his number 3.
*1959 Gretsch White Falcon Project-o-Sonic – This guitar was used by Malcolm for Back in Black and For Those About to Rock, as well as respective tours. It featured a Cadillac G wire tailpiece and two FilterTron pickups. At some point after the For Those About to Rock tour, it was &quot;fixed&quot; by someone other than his guitar tech and it lost its signature sound. It was sold shortly after the For Those About to Rock tour and has changed hands several times, it is now owned by the Hard Rock Cafe.
*Gibson L6S – Malcolm purchased this guitar in early 1975 while The Beast was getting repaired after a headstock break. It featured a natural finish, two humbucker pickups, a tune-o-matic bridge and tailpiece and a black pickguard. Upon AC/DC&#x27;s arrival in the UK during 1976, it was modified to a double cut and had the neck pickup and pickguard removed. This guitar was used by Angus briefly as a backup, it was then given to Stevie Young in 1980 who sold it in 1982, before it resurfaced in 2015.

== Illness and death ==
At the conclusion of the Black Ice World Tour in 2010, Young was diagnosed with lung cancer. It was treated at an early stage, so surgery was successful and the cancer was removed. He also had an unspecified heart problem and had a pacemaker.

In April 2014, Young became seriously ill and was unable to continue performing. On 16 April 2014, AC/DC released a note stating that Young would be &quot;taking a break from the band due to ill health&quot;. However, singer Brian Johnson stated that despite earlier reports, AC/DC are not retiring: &quot;We are definitely getting together in May in Vancouver. We&#x27;re going to pick up guitars, have a plonk and see if anybody has got any tunes or ideas. If anything happens we&#x27;ll record it.&quot; In July, Johnson revealed that Young was in hospital receiving treatment for an unspecified condition and during May recording sessions had been replaced in the studio by guitarist Stevie Young, his nephew. On 24 September 2014, the band&#x27;s management announced that Young was officially retiring and would not be rejoining AC/DC. Stevie Young continued to fill in for Malcolm on the band&#x27;s 2015 Rock or Bust World Tour and eventually became his full-time replacement.

On 26 September 2014, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Young had been diagnosed with dementia and had been admitted to a nursing home where he could receive full-time care. A source close to Young was quoted in this article as saying that he had &quot;complete loss of short-term memory&quot;. Young&#x27;s family confirmed four days later that he had dementia, saying that Young &quot;is suffering from dementia and the family thanks you for respecting their privacy&quot;.

In subsequent interviews, Angus stated that his brother had been experiencing lapses in memory and concentration before the &quot;Black Ice&quot; project and had been receiving treatment during the Black Ice World Tour which ended in 2010. Angus confirmed that although his brother did not play on the 2014 &quot;Rock or Bust&quot; album: &quot;He still likes his music. We make sure he has his Chuck Berry, a little Buddy Holly.&quot; He added that AC/DC would continue according to his brother&#x27;s wishes and standards: &quot;Look, even with his health, Malcolm was touring until he couldn&#x27;t do it anymore.&quot; In that same interview, Angus stated that Young was rehearsing AC/DC&#x27;s songs repeatedly before every concert just to remember how they went.

In an interview with &quot;Guitar Player&quot; about Young&#x27;s songwriting credits in &quot;Rock or Bust&quot;, Angus stated:

Young died from the disease on 18 November 2017 at the age of 64, at Lulworth House in Elizabeth Bay. His funeral was held at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, on 28 November. Young&#x27;s elder brother George died a few weeks before him, on 22 October 2017.

== Legacy and influence ==

Influenced by 1950s rock and roll and blues-based rock guitarists of the 1960s and 1970s, Young was regarded as a leading rock exponent of rhythm guitar.

&quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine has stated that the secret to Young&#x27;s guitar technique was playing open chords through a series of Marshall amplifiers, set to low volume without high gain. This is contrary to a common belief of many rock guitarists that rhythm guitar should involve loud and overdriven power chords.

Dave Mustaine of Megadeth stated in a 2004 interview that he considered himself, Young, Rudolf Schenker of The Scorpions, and James Hetfield of Metallica to be the best rhythm guitarists in the world.

In 2006, he was the subject of a song (and album) title by Australian punk rock band Frenzal Rhomb: &quot;Forever Malcolm Young&quot;.

In 2017, Gretsch guitars reissued the Gretsch G6131MY, a signature guitar based on Young&#x27;s modified 1963 Gretsch Jet Firebird.

On the day of Young&#x27;s passing, several of the biggest names in rock and metal sent out tributes to Young, including Eddie Van Halen, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Lars Ulrich of Metallica, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, Billy Idol, Paul Stanley of Kiss, Joe Walsh, Joe Satriani, Def Leppard, Scott Ian of Anthrax, Foo Fighters, Alice Cooper, Muse, and Vince Neil and Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe and many more. Many of these artists covered an AC/DC song at their concerts on the day of or around the time of Young&#x27;s passing as part of their tribute, including Foo Fighters and Guns N&#x27; Roses.

<doc id="558140" wikidata="Q313549" url="?curid=558140" title="Mrs.">
<text>Mrs. (American English) or Mrs (British English; standard English pronunciation: ) is a commonly used English honorific for women, usually for those who are married and who do not instead use another title or rank, such as &quot;Doctor&quot;, &quot;Professor&quot;, &quot;President&quot;, &quot;Dame&quot;, etc. In most Commonwealth countries, a full stop (period) is usually not used with the title. In the United States and Canada a period (full stop) is usually used (see Abbreviation).

&quot;Mrs.&quot; originated as a contraction of the honorific &quot;Mistress&quot; (the feminine of &quot;Mister&quot; or &quot;Master&quot;) which was originally applied to both married and unmarried women in the upper class. Writers who used &quot;Mrs&quot; for unmarried women include Daniel Defoe, Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, and Samuel Johnson. The split into &quot;Mrs&quot; for married women and &quot;Miss&quot; for unmarried began during the 17th century, but was not reliable until well into the 19th century. 

It is rare for &quot;Mrs.&quot; to be written in a non-abbreviated form, and the unabbreviated word lacks a standard spelling. In literature it may appear as &quot;missus&quot; or &quot;missis&quot; in dialogue. A variant in the works of Thomas Hardy and others is &quot;Mis&#x27;ess&quot;, reflecting its etymology. &quot;Misses&quot; has been used but is ambiguous, as this is a commonly used plural for &quot;Miss&quot;. The plural of &quot;Mrs.&quot; is from the French: &quot;Mesdames&quot;. This may be used as is in written correspondence, or it may be abbreviated &quot;Mmes&quot;.

==Traditional usage==
Originally, Mrs was used with a woman&#x27;s own first name and married surname. Abigail Adams, for example, was addressed as Mrs. Abigail Adams. In the 19th century, it became common to use the husband&#x27;s first name instead of the wife&#x27;s. Jane Austen gave some of the earliest examples of that form when she wrote of Mrs. John Dashwood. By the early 20th century, that usage was standard, and the forms &quot;Mrs Jane Smith&quot;, &quot;Mrs Miller&quot; (wife of John Smith), or &quot;Mrs Miller-Smith&quot; were considered incorrect by many etiquette writers. Many feminists (such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman) objected, but they disagreed on whether the problem was the title &quot;Mrs&quot; or the husband&#x27;s first name or the husband&#x27;s surname.

In several languages, the title for married women such as &quot;Madame&quot;, &quot;Señora&quot;, &quot;Signora&quot;, or &quot;Frau&quot;, is the direct feminine equivalent of the title used for men; the title for unmarried women is a diminutive: &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Señorita&quot;, &quot;Signorina&quot;, or &quot;Fräulein&quot;. For this reason, usage had shifted toward using the married title as the default for all women in professional usage. This had long been followed in the United Kingdom for some high-ranking household staff, such as housekeepers, cooks, and nannies, who were called &quot;Mrs.&quot; as a mark of respect regardless of marital status.

In the United Kingdom, the traditional form for a divorcée was &quot;Mrs Jane Smith&quot;. In the U.S., the divorcée originally retained her full married name unless she remarried. Later, the form &quot;Mrs. Miller Smith&quot; was sometimes used, with the birth surname in place of the first name. However, the form &quot;Mrs. Jane Miller&quot; eventually became widely-used for divorcées, even in formal correspondence; that is, &quot;Mrs.&quot; preceded the divorcée&#x27;s maiden name. 

Before social mores relaxed to the point where single women with children were socially acceptable, the unwed mother was often advised by etiquette mavens like Emily Post to use &quot;Mrs.&quot; with her maiden name to avoid scrutiny. 

The separation of &quot;Miss&quot; and &quot;Mrs.&quot; became problematic as more women entered the white-collar workforce because it was difficult to change names and titles when they had already established a career. Women who became famous or well known in their professional circles before marriage often kept their birth names, stage names, or pen names. &quot;Miss&quot; became the appellation for celebrities (e.g., Miss Helen Hayes, or Miss Amelia Earhart) but this also proved problematic, as when a married woman &quot;did&quot; use her husband’s last name but was still referred to as &quot;Miss&quot;; see more at Ms. and Miss.

==Modern usage==
It is now very uncommon for a woman to be addressed by her husband&#x27;s first name; however, this still sometimes occurs if a couple is being addressed jointly, such as in &quot;Mr. and Mrs. John Smith&quot;.

Many married women still use the title with their spouse&#x27;s last name but retaining their first name (e.g., &quot;Mrs Jane Smith&quot;). Other married women choose not to adopt their spouse&#x27;s last name at all. It is generally considered polite to address a woman by &quot;Ms.&quot; rather than &quot;Mrs.&quot;, unless the preference of the woman in question is clearly-known. This is especially true in written communication, as dictated by professional etiquette. 

Modern etiquette provides various options in addressing married couples in which the wife uses her own last name, or uses a title such as &quot;Dr.&quot;, &quot;Mayor&quot;, or &quot;Ms.&quot;. Etiquette-writer Judith Martin (&quot;Miss Manners&quot;) generally advises that, in non-standard situations, the individuals be addressed on separate lines when writing invitations (e.g., &quot;Dr. Sue Martin/Mr. John Martin&quot;).

In direct address, a woman with the title &quot;Mrs.&quot; may be addressed &quot;Mrs. [Lastname]&quot;, or with the stand-alone &quot;Madam&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;, although the latter two are more-often used for any adult woman, regardless of marital status, in modern conversation. It is normally considered correct to address a woman as &quot;Ms. [Lastname]&quot;, regardless of her marital status.

<doc id="558143" wikidata="Q328734" url="?curid=558143" title="Saad Zaghloul">
<text>Saad Zaghloul Pasha ( / ; also &quot;Sa&#x27;d Zaghloul Pasha ibn Ibrahim&quot;) (July 1857 – 23 August 1927) was an Egyptian revolutionary and statesman. He was the leader of Egypt&#x27;s nationalist Wafd Party, and served as the first Honorary President of Al Ahly SC.

He led a civil disobedience campaign with the goal of achieving independence for Egypt (and Sudan) from British rule. He played a key role in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919, as well as played a role in prompting the British Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence in 1922. He served as Prime Minister of Egypt from 26 January 1924 to 24 November 1924.

==Education, activism and exile==

Zaghloul was born in Ibyana village in the Kafr el-Sheikh Governorate of Egypt&#x27;s Nile Delta. For his post-secondary education, he attended Al-Azhar University and a French law school in Cairo. By working as a Europeanized lawyer, Zaghloul gained both wealth and status in a traditional framework of upward mobility. Despite this, Zaghloul&#x27;s success can equally be attributed to his familiarity with the Egyptian countryside and its many idioms. He was part of the Egyptian freemason lodge. In 1918, he became politically active, as the founding leader of the Wafd Party, for which he was later arrested.

==Rise in the bureaucracy==

Upon his release from prison, he practiced law and distinguished himself; amassed some independent means, which enabled him to participate in Egyptian politics, then dominated by the struggle of moderate and extremist against British occupation; and effected useful, permanent links with different factions of Egyptian nationalists. He became close to Princess Nazli Fazl, and his contacts with the Egyptian upper class led to his marriage to the daughter of the Egyptian prime minister Mustafa Fahmi Pasha, whose friendship with Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, then the effective British ruler of Egypt, accounts in part for the eventual acceptability of Zaghloul to the British occupation. In succession, Zaghloul was appointed judge, minister of education (1906–1908), minister of justice (1910–1912); and in 1913 he became vice-president of the Legislative Assembly.

In all his ministerial positions, Zaghloul undertook certain measures of reform that were acceptable to both Egyptian nationalists and the British occupation. Throughout this period, he kept himself outside extreme Egyptian nationalist factions, and although acceptable to the British occupation, he was not thereby compromised in the eyes of his Egyptian compatriots. The relationship between Britain and Egypt continued to deteriorate during and after the Great War.

==Exile==

Zaghloul became increasingly active in nationalist movements, and in 1919 he led an official Egyptian delegation (or &quot;wafd&quot;, the name of the political party he would later form) to the Paris Peace Conference demanding that the United Kingdom formally recognize the independence and unity of Egypt and Sudan (which had been united as one country under Muhammad Ali Pasha). Other members of the delegation were Hamad Mahmoud El Bassel Pasha and Abdel Latif Mikabbaty. Britain had occupied the country in 1882, and declared it a protectorate at the outbreak of the First World War. Though Egypt and Sudan had its own Sultan, parliament and armed forces, it had effectively been under British rule for the duration of the occupation.

The British in turn demanded that Zaghloul end his political agitation. When he refused, they exiled him to Malta, and later to the Seychelles. In 1922, he was moved from the Seychelles and was taken to Gibraltar due to ill health arriving there on board HMS &quot;Curlew&quot; and he was released in 1923. They had employed a similar tactic against Egyptian nationalist leader Ahmed Orabi in 1882, whom they exiled to Ceylon. At the time of Zaghloul&#x27;s arrival in the Seychelles, a number of other prominent anti-imperialist leaders were also exiled there, including Mohamoud Ali Shire, the 26th Sultan of the Warsangali, with whom Zaghloul would soon develop a rapport. In order to avoid engendering anti-colonial sentiments, the colonial government imposed edicts which censored letters that exiled individuals sent to their family and compatriots back home. Zaghloul regularly found a way around these controls. He and other prominent exiles employed letter-writing as major non-violent political tools of communication, through which they were able to describe their time in exile beyond the Seychelles.

==Political history==

Zaghloul&#x27;s absence caused disturbances in Egypt, ultimately leading to the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. 

Upon his return from exile, Zaghloul led the Egyptian nationalist forces. He began to formulate a strong base amid his return which led to the elections of 12 January 1924 giving the Wafd Party an overwhelming majority, and two weeks later, led to Zaghloul forming the first Wafdist government. As P. J. Vatikiotis writes in &quot;The History of Modern Egypt&quot; (4th ed., pp. 279 ff.):

Following the assassination on 19 November 1924 of Sir Lee Stack, the Sirdar and Governor-General of the Sudan, and subsequent British demands which Zaghloul felt to be unacceptable, Zaghloul resigned. Yet he returned to active politics two years later and, though he never again held the Prime Ministership, he remained an extremely influential figure until his death in 1927.

== Family ==

Zaghloul&#x27;s wife, Safiya Khānūm, was the daughter of Mustafa Fahmi Pasha, the Egyptian cabinet minister and two-time prime minister of Egypt. A feminist and revolutionary, she was also active in politics.

Zaghloul&#x27;s brother, Ahmad Fathy Zaghlul was a lawyer and politician. He had several administrative and government posts, and at one point was Deputy Minister of Justice. In 1906 he was amongst the Egyptian judges at the summary trial for the Denshawai Incident.

He is buried with his wife in their mausoleum Beit El-Umma in Cairo.

<doc id="558157" wikidata="Q1040851" url="?curid=558157" title="Carl Theodor Zahle">
<text>Carl Theodor Zahle (19 January 1866 in Roskilde – 3 February 1946 in Copenhagen), was a Danish lawyer and politician who served as the prime minister of Denmark from 1909 to 1910 and again from 1913 to 1920. In 1895, he was elected as a member of the lower chamber of the Danish parliament, the Folketing, for the Liberal Party (&quot;Venstrereformpartiet&quot;). A campaigner for peace, in 1905 he co-founded the Social Liberal Party (&quot;Det Radikale Venstre&quot;) together with other (mostly pacifistic) disgruntled members of &quot;Venstrereformpartiet&quot;. He continued on as a member of the &quot;Folketinget&quot; for &quot;Det Radikale Venstre&quot; until 1928, when he became a member of the upper chamber of parliament (&quot;Landsting&quot;). In 1929 he became justice minister, a post which he held until 1935.

Zahle was instrumental in starting negotiations for a new Danish–Icelandic Act of Union (&quot;Dansk-Islandsk Forbundslov&quot;) in 1917, which resulted in Iceland being recognized as a sovereign nation in a personal union with the king of Denmark the following year.

== Early life ==
C. Th. Zahle was born in Roskilde as the son of cobbler Christian Lauritz Gottlieb Zahle and his wife Karen Emilie. He was interested in politics already in high school and saw himself as a convinced democrat in opposition to the Estrup government. He took a degree in law in 1890 and worked for some time at newspapers for instance the newspaper Politiken. In 1894 he passed the bar exam to the high courts.

== Political career ==
In 1895 he was elected to the lower house of the Danish Rigsdag in the Ringsted election district. He won the seat and kept it in subsequent elections until 1928 where he was elected to the upper house of parliament. He kept his seat there until 1939. He was a co-founder of the Left Reform Party (&quot;Venstrereformpartiet&quot;) in 1895 and became a member of the parliamentary finance committee in 1901.

After disagreements with party leader Jens Christian Christensen (1856–1930) on the defence budget Zahle broke with his party and co-founded the Social Liberal Party (&quot;Det Radikale Venstre&quot;) in 1905 and became the first chairman of the new party. In 1909 he was able to form a minority government but had to resign as prime minister the year later following an electoral defeat for his party. In 1911 he became mayor of Stege. In 1913 the Social Liberal Party and the Social Democrats got a majority in the lower house and Zahle was able to form a government backed by the Social Democrats. This government was in office until 1920.

Zahle was prime minister during World War I and the main objective for his administration during the war was to keep Denmark neutral. Zahle succeeded in this thanks to foreign minister Erik Scavenius (1877–1962). Although Denmark was neutral the war meant a scarcity of goods and materials and regulation of the economy became necessary. Danish foreign minister Ove Rode (1867–1933) was in charge of these policies.

After the war the opposition had accumulated great anger towards the Zahle government. The government was accused of having been too friendly towards Germany during the war and the economic regulations limited the profits of business life. On top of that came the question about northern Schleswig and in particular Flensburg in Southern Schleswig. A referendum was held on the return of parts of Schleswig to Denmark from Germany and it was demanded that Germany should cede the city of Flensburg with no regards to the result of the referendum. Zahle refused to call for an election on this question and was deposed by King Christian X in 1920. This resulted in the Easter Crisis of 1920 (&quot;Påskekrisen 1920&quot;) where social liberals, social democrats and socialists saw the king&#x27;s dismissal of Zahle as unconstitutional.

Zahle never became prime minister again but he became minister of justice under Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning (1873–1942) from 1929 to 1935. He held this portfolio in his own governments and had worked for legal reforms. From 1936 to 1939 he was speaker of the upper house. From 1936 until 1945 he was a board member of nationwide daily &quot;Politiken&quot;.

<doc id="558165" wikidata="Q332096" url="?curid=558165" title="Alexandros Zaimis">
<text>Alexandros Zaimis (, : &quot;Aléxandros Zaímis&quot;; 28 October 1855 – 15 September 1936) was a Greek politician who served as Greece&#x27;s Prime Minister, Minister of the Interior, Minister of Justice, and High Commissioner of Crete. He served as prime minister six times. Although he was a leader of the monarchist faction, Zaimis was the third and last President of the Second Hellenic Republic.

==Early life and family==
Zaimis was born in Athens, a son of Thrasyvoulos Zaimis, a former Prime Minister of Greece, and Eleni Mourouzi. His brother was Asimakis Zaimis. 

On his father&#x27;s side he was the grandson of Andreas Zaimis, another former prime minister of Greece, and related to the great Kalavrytan family with notable participation in the Greek War of Independence from 1821. From his mother&#x27;s side he was a descendant of an important Fanariote family of the Mourozidon. His family lived in Kerpini, Kalavryta in the Achaia prefecture.

He studied law at the University of Athens and at the University of Heidelberg. He also attended the universities of Leipzig, Paris and Berlin.

==Political career==

Alexandros became involved in politics after the death of his father who was the elected member of parliament for Kalavryta.

He became a Member of Parliament in 1885. He served as Minister of the Interior and Justice Minister in Theodoros Deligiannis&#x27; government (1890–92) and Speaker of the Hellenic Parliament (1895-97). He became prime minister for the first time in 1897.

===Appointment as High Commissioner===

In 1906, he was appointed as High Commissioner of Crete and presided over a critical period of the island&#x27;s history up to the &quot;de facto&quot; union of Crete with Greece in 1908.

===Re-election as Prime Minister===

Alexandros Zaimis was re-elected as prime minister a further five times. He was appointed prime minister under King Constantine I to succeed Venizelos in October 1915, but resigned a month later when his government failed to receive a vote of confidence. In 1917, Zaimis served again as prime minister under King Constantine I, while Eleftherios Venizelos led a rival government controlling northern Greece. Under Entente pressure, he resigned in favor of Venizelos in June of the same year. During World War I, he was generally supposed to favor neutrality for Greece, but to be personally in favor of the Allies.

A moderate conservative, he served again as prime minister in the Second Hellenic Republic, from 1926 to 1928, in a coalition government of Venizelist and moderate conservatives.

Zaimis was elected the third and last President of the Second Hellenic Republic in 1929. He was reelected in 1934. However, only one year into his second term, he was thrown out of office by Georgios Kondylis, who abolished the Republic and proclaimed himself regent pending the results of a referendum on restoring the monarchy. This referendum resulted in George II being recalled to the throne by almost 98 percent of the vote, a high total that was obtained because no-monarchist supported the abstension to vote for protest (there was no secrecy of vote).

==Death and legacy==

He died on 15 September 1936 in Vienna, Austria and was buried in the First Cemetery of Athens. He was married without children. The political legacy of his family was continued by his siblings and cousins.

<text>Francisco Javier Martínez de Zaldúa y Racines was a Colombian lawyer and politician, who was elected as President of Colombia in 1882.

==Early life==
Zaldúa was born in Bogotá, Cundinamarca, on December 3, 1811. His father was don Manuel Maria Zaldúa, a prominent member of the Nueva Granada high society and a very wealthy man. He donated most of his fortune to the cause of independence and in particular to General Antonio Nariño. When the Spanish &quot;Pacificador&quot;, General Pablo Morillo, made his triumphant entry in Bogotá, the Zaldúa family was attending the military parade. Zaldúa&#x27;s father was so offended and outraged, that he suffered a massive heart attack and died instantly.

Zaldúa studied jurisprudence and theology at the &quot;Colegio Mayor de San Bartolomé&quot;, where he graduated with a double mayor and obtained diplomas in Law and Divinity.

==Professional career==
Zaldúa was a professor of Civil Law and Canonical Law between 1837 and 1866. He later entered the judicial branch where he advanced all the way to Justice of the Supreme Court. As President of this legislative body, Zaldúa became the &quot;de facto&quot; President of the United States of Colombia for 6 days, when President Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera ceded executive power to the convention, and until the said convention elected a Council of Ministers to serve collectively as the Colombian head of state.

==Political career==

Zaldúa initiated his political career by being elected to the City Council of Bogotá. In 1840 he was elected to the House of Representatives and, later to the Senate, both in representation of his native state of Cundinamarca. He was also appointed as Minister of Government during the administration of President José Hilario López.

Zaldúa served as President of the Rionegro Convention, a constituent assembly that created the United States of Colombia, now the Republic of Colombia.

===Presidency===
In 1881, the presidential campaign to succeed the conservative President Rafael Núñez was taking place. Zaldúa was a man of immense prestige and reputation and José María Rojas Garrido nominated him as candidate for the presidency. The Colombian Liberal Party, which had been divided for many years, united around his name.

Zaldúa was 71 years old by then. Former president Aquileo Parra led the convention&#x27;s commission that went to his home to request his acceptance. Zaldúa, in his acceptance speech said: &quot;“In the sunset of my life, I have nothing else to offer to the liberal party, but my last days. I hereby accept this nomination as my death sentence”&quot;. The Conservative Party abstained from the elections, and Zaldúa defeated fellow Liberal Solón Wilches. He was inaugurated on April 1, 1882.

==Death==
Zaldúa died in Bogotá, in the Government Palace, on December 21, 1882. He was the first Colombian President to die while in office.

<doc id="558173" wikidata="Q1091832" url="?curid=558173" title="Screamadelica">
<text>Screamadelica is the third studio album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream. It was first released on 23 September 1991 in the United Kingdom by Creation Records and on 8 October 1991 in the United States by Sire Records. The album marked a significant departure from the band&#x27;s early indie rock sound, drawing inspiration from the blossoming house music scene and associated drugs such as LSD and MDMA. Much of the album&#x27;s production was handled by acid house DJ Andrew Weatherall and engineer Hugo Nicolson, who remixed original recordings made by the band into dance-oriented tracks.

&quot;Screamadelica&quot;, featuring Manchester-born singer Denise Johnson, was the band&#x27;s first album to be a commercial success, peaking at number eight on the UK Albums Chart upon its release. It received wide praise from critics, and has been frequently named one of the best albums of the 1990s in various polls. It won the first Mercury Music Prize in 1992 and has sold over three million copies worldwide.

==Background, music, influences and recording==
When asked what his influences were for &quot;Screamadelica&quot;, singer Bobby Gillespie said that Primal Scream were like a rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll band who had quite diverse taste. Many genres interested them like free jazz, funk, soul, country, blues, electronic music, post-punk, ambient music and psychedelic music from the 1960s. When naming the post-punk bands he listened to during his formative years, he explained: &quot;a lot of those ideas are entrenched in Primal Scream, and maybe the last great rock bands were Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Buzzcocks and Joy Division. [...] The ideas in the music and the lyrics for those three bands completely influenced Primal Scream&quot;. &quot;Screamadelica&quot; was also influenced by the Beach Boys&#x27; album &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966). Gillespie says that after discovering the album, their songs became much softer. Gillespie has also cited Nico&#x27;s album &quot;The Marble Index&quot; as a major influence when they were making &quot;Screamadelica&quot;, claiming he &quot;listened to [it] all the time.&quot; The band were also &quot;big fans of &#x27;70s reggae and dub. These 12” sounded like dub records&quot;.

Drawing inspiration from the acid house scene, which was blossoming at the time, the band enlisted house DJs Andrew Weatherall and Terry Farley on producing duties. Weatherall and Gillespie bonded over &quot;Thin Lizzy, dub-reggae, Mott The Hoople, disco music&quot; and they were both attracted by &quot;industrial, experimental funk&quot;. The band loved the fact that Weatherall was a DJ who had never been a producer at the helm in a studio before. Gillespie commented on: &quot;It was just this natural talent to make this music and structure and arrange music in a way that we’d never heard before. So he could take our songwriting and our instrumental[s] [...] And the melodies and the gospel singers and the strings and the slate guitars, we played a lot of synthesisers as well. [...]&quot;. Weatherall selected the parts he liked and rearranged it: &quot;he was really great at taking all this stuff and rearranging it and making it into this fantastic music&quot;. Acid house gave him an opportunity to work with the band.

&quot;Loaded&quot; was the first track on which Weatherall took part. He began remixing &quot;I&#x27;m Losing More Than I&#x27;ll Ever Have&quot;, from their previous album, and the resulting track disassembled the song, adding a drum loop from an Italian bootleg mix of Edie Brickell&#x27;s &quot;What I Am&quot; and a sample from the Peter Fonda B movie &quot;The Wild Angels.&quot;

Although the band wrote a track also called &quot;Screamadelica&quot;, it does not appear on the album. The ten-minute dance track was also produced by Weatherall and sung by Denise Johnson. It appears on the &quot;Dixie-Narco EP,&quot; released in 1992, and is featured in the opening credits of the now rare &quot;Screamadelica&quot; VHS video tape.

==Artwork==
The album cover for &quot;Screamadelica&quot; was painted by Creation Records&#x27; in-house artist Paul Cannell. Cannell was inspired by a damp water spot he&#x27;d seen on the Creation Records offices ceiling after taking LSD.

&quot;Screamadelica&quot; was among ten album covers chosen by the Royal Mail for a set of &quot;Classic Album Cover&quot; postage stamps issued in January 2010.

The artwork also inspired a Fender Stratocaster for the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary.

==Release and commercial performance==
The lead single &quot;Loaded&quot; reached the top 20 in the UK Singles chart in early 1990.

&quot;Screamadelica&quot; was released on 23 September 1991 in the UK. It reached number 8 on the UK Albums Chart, and was later certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The album has sold 715,000 copies as of September 2020. The single &quot;Movin&#x27; On Up&quot; was the band&#x27;s breakthrough hit in the United States: as it was heavily played on alternative rock radio, it peaked at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. It also reached number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart as it was played on rock radio stations.

==Critical reception and legacy==
&quot;Screamadelica&quot; was very well received by critics. In a contemporary review for &quot;Spin&quot;, Simon Reynolds called it a &quot;totally mind-blowing&quot; record whose best songs were &quot;almost unclassifiable&quot;. AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine deemed &quot;Screamadelica&quot; &quot;an album that transcends its time and influence.&quot; AllMusic lists the album as the band&#x27;s best. It was voted number 135 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd Edition (2000)&quot;.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; praised the album on their 2003 list of the &quot;Top 100 albums of the &#x27;90s,&quot; saying: &quot;&quot;Screamadelica&quot;&#x27;s atmospheric and imaginative hybrid of past, present and future captured its moment in vivid color and splendor, and it still radiates with a kaleidoscopic glow.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, on the other hand, assigned it a &quot;neither&quot; rating, indicating an album that does not warrant repeated listening despite coherent craft and one or two highlights.

It was &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s album of the year in 1991. It was also &quot;Select&quot;″s album of the year in 1991, while &quot;NME&quot; placed it at no. 3 in its &quot;Best Albums of 1991&quot; list. The album won the first Mercury Music Prize in 1992. In 1996, &quot;Select&quot; named it as the number 1 album of the 1990s. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; placed the album at number 18 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums.&quot; In 2001, &quot;Q&quot; placed it at number 81 on a list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums of All Time.&quot; The album ranked number 2 in &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Best 50 Albums of Q&#x27;s Lifetime&quot; list. In 2003, &quot;NME&quot; placed it at no. 23 in its &quot;100 Best Albums Ever&quot; list. In 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it at number 77 in a list of the &quot;Top 100 Albums of the &#x27;90s.&quot; Also in 2003, the album topped &quot;The Scotsman&quot;″s list of 100 Best Scottish Albums. In 2006, the magazine also placed it at no. 15 in its &quot;Greatest British Albums Ever&quot; list. It appeared in Channel 4&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Albums of All Time.&quot; In a 2009 review, the BBC hailed the album as &quot;a solid gold classic.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; also named it the &quot;Druggiest Album Ever&quot; in 2011. It was ranked number 437 in the 2020 revised edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and No. 1 on &quot;BrooklynVegan&quot; &quot;Creation Records&#x27; 21 Best Records&quot; list.

&quot;Movin&#x27; On Up&quot; was used on the previous Telewest Broadband commercials before Virgin Media bought them out. Subsequently, Bacardi spirits used the song on a UK television ad. The song was also featured in the popular game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; on alternative radio station Radio X. A Northern soul version was also recorded by Edwin Starr for the cult British surfing film &quot;Blue Juice&quot;. Kellogg&#x27;s used the song in an advert for their cornflakes in c. 2011.

Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of French electronic duo Daft Punk, who drew inspiration from the rock and acid house in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s, referred to &quot;Screamadelica&quot; as the record that &quot;put everything together in terms of genre&quot;.

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the release of the album, Primal Scream performed the entire album live at Olympia London in West London on 26 and 27 November 2010. The performance included a full gospel choir and horn section. The first of these gigs was broadcast live on BBC 6 Music, presented by Steve Lamacq. These gigs were followed by a UK tour in March 2011, where the band performed the album in full.

For the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 2021, Fender created a limited run of custom Stratocasters depicting the album&#x27;s artwork on the body. Additionally, Columbia released the Demodelica album on 15 October 2021, with early demos and work-in-progress mixes, accompanied by notes by Jon Savage. &quot;Most of these demos were produced by Andrew Innes at his home studio on the Isle of Dogs and at the band&#x27;s studio in Hackney in 1990. The Jam and Eden Studio demos were produced by the band in 1991.&quot;

<text>Zaleucus (; fl. 7th century BC) was the Greek lawgiver of Epizephyrian Locris, in Magna Graecia. According to the Suda, he was previously a slave and a shepherd, and after having been educated he gave laws to his fellow-citizens. Some sources make him a Pythagorean philosopher, although older ones put him as older than Pythagoras or even deny his existence altogether. They also attribute divine origin to his laws.

Most probably, he devised the first written European law code, the Locrian code, in the 7th century BC. The code, however, is lost except for some later mentions and imitations which seem clearly anachronistic. These, which among other things mention that: 
 It also banned the drinking of undiluted wine except for medical purposes.

Although the Locrian code distinctly favored the aristocracy, Zaleucus was famous for his conciliation of societal factions. No other facts of his life at all are certain. According to legends, he punished adultery with the forfeiture of sight. When his own son was condemned of this, he refused to exonerate him, instead submitting to the loss of one of his own eyes instead of exacting the full penalty of the culprit. Another law that he established forbade anyone from entering the Senate House armed. Faced with an emergency, he did so anyway, but when he was reminded of the law, he immediately fell upon his sword as a sacrifice to the sovereignty of the claims of social order. A similar story is told of Charondas.

Anyone who proposed a new law, or the alteration of one already existing, had to appear before the Citizen&#x27;s Council with a rope round his neck. If the Council voted against the proposal the proposer was immediately strangled.
Demosthenes (in &quot;Against Timocrates&quot;), who to persuade the Athenians not to change any law upon small and frivolous pretences, gives the example of these Locrians, &quot;with whom&quot;, says he, &quot;it&#x27;s a law, that a man who shall propose to make any new law shall do it with a rope about his neck, which he shall be strangled in, if he do not carry his point: which has been such a guard and defence to the laws, that there has been but one new one made in&quot; MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEARS. (Demost. in Timocr. p. 469.) Now. that Demosthenes here speaks of Zaleucus&#x27;s laws is plain enough from his naming the Locrians; but it appears further from the law itself. For Hierocles and Polybius&#x27;s author say expressly, &quot;that this law about the rope was&quot; Zaleucus&#x27;s; (Hieroc. apud Stobaeum, Serm. 37. Polyb. xii, p. 661.)

<doc id="558186" wikidata="Q552220" url="?curid=558186" title="Giuseppe Zanardelli">
<text>Giuseppe Zanardelli (29 October 1826 26 December 1903) was an Italian jurist and political figure. He served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 15 February 1901 to 3 November 1903. An eloquent orator, he was also a Grand Master freemason. Zanardelli, representing the bourgeoisie from Lombardy, personified the classical 19th-century liberalism, committed to suffrage expansion, anticlericalism, civil liberties, free trade and laissez-faire economics. Throughout his long political career, he was among the most ardent advocates of freedom of conscience and divorce.

==Early life==

Giuseppe Zanardelli was born in Brescia (Lombardy) on 29 October 1826. He was a combatant in the volunteer corps during the First Italian War of Independence of 1848 between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Sardinia, within the era of Italian unification (Risorgimento). After the lost battle of Novara he went to Pisa to study law, and he returned to Brescia to become a barrister. For a time earned a livelihood by teaching law, but was molested by the Austrian police and forbidden to teach in consequence of his refusal to contribute pro-Austrian articles to the press.

In 1859 he was forced to flee to Switzerland. He moved to Lugano, but returned in time to organize the insurrection of Brescia in the Second Italian War of Independence and welcomed Giuseppe Garibaldi in the city. Enlisted in the Cacciatori delle Alpi (Hunters of the Alps), he remained in the area until the armistice of Villafranca. With the annexation of Lombardy to Piedmont, he was elected to Parliament in Turin.

Elected deputy in 1859, he received various administrative appointments, but only attained a political office in 1876 when the Left, of which he had been a prominent and influential member, came into power. Zanardelli became a freemason in 1860; he was initiated in the Lodge &quot;Propaganda&quot; of Rome.

==In government==
In 1876 he became Minister of Public Works in the first government of Agostino Depretis, and Minister of the Interior in the government of Benedetto Cairoli in 1878. In the latter capacity, he drafted the franchise reform, but created dissatisfaction by the indecision of his administrative acts, particularly in regard to the Irredentist agitation, and by his theory of repressing and not in any way preventing crime, which led for a time to an epidemic of murders.

Overthrown with Cairoli in December 1878, he returned to power as Minister of Justice in 1881 with the Depretis government, and succeeded in completing the commercial code. He also was the architect of the electoral reform in 1892 which lowered the voting age from 25 to 21, and reduced the minimum tax threshold for voting or allowed an elementary school certificate.

Abandoned awhile by Depretis in 1883, he remained in opposition until 1887, when he again joined Depretis as Minister of Justice, retaining his portfolio throughout the ensuing government of Francesco Crispi, until 31 January 1891. During this period he began the reform of the magistracy and promulgated a new penal code, which unified penal legislation in Italy, abolished capital punishment and recognised the workers right to strike. The code was regarded as a great work by contemporary European jurists.

After the fall of the government of Giovanni Giolitti in 1893, Zanardelli made a strenuous but unsuccessful attempt to form an administration. Elected president of the chamber in 1894 and 1896, he exercised that office with ability until, in December 1897, he accepted the Ministry of Justice in the government of Antonio di Rudinì, only to resign in the following spring on account of dissensions with his colleague, Emilio, marquis Visconti-Venosta, over the measures necessary to prevent a recurrence of the Bava-Beccaris massacre of May 1898.

==Prime minister==
Returning to the presidency of the chamber, he again abandoned his post in order to associate himself with the obstructionist campaign against the Public Safety Bill (1899–1900) restricting political activity and free speech, which was introduced by the government of general Luigi Pelloux. He was rewarded by being enabled to form an administration with the support of the Extreme Left upon the fall of the government of Giuseppe Saracco in February 1901. Giolitti became Minister of the Interior in the administration of Zanardelli, and became its real head.

Zanardelli focused his attention on the issue of the South: in September 1902 he undertook a journey through Basilicata, as one of the poorest regions in Italy, to see for himself the problems in the Mezzogiorno. In 1902, a law was passed that set the minimum working age at 12, while also limiting the working day for female workers to 11 hours. That same year, a Supreme Council of Labour was set up as an advisory body (as noted by one historian) &quot;to examine labour issues and to give its opinion on proposed legislation.&quot; A law introduced on June the 21st 1902 authorized the establishment of an agricultural credit institution in Latium with the power to grant short- and long-term agricultural credit in that province. In May 1903, legislation was passed aimed at improving living conditions; with the establishment of a Public Housing Institute. A law for reducing tax on flour was also approved, while provision was made treating poor people affected by pellagra or malaria. However, his proposed Divorce Bill, although voted in the chamber, had to be withdrawn on account of the strong opposition of the country. He retired from the administration on 21 October 1903, and Giolitti succeeded him as Prime Minister. Tired and ill, he died in Maderno on 26 December 1903.

==In popular culture==
On 15 September 1902, Zanardelli stayed at the Imperial Hotel Tramontano, owned by the Commendator Guglielmo Baron Tramontano of Sorrento, who was also the mayor of the city Sorrento. Baron Guglielmo Tramontano asked the musician brothers Giambattista and Ernesto De Curtis to compose and write a song in honour of Zanardelli, and the result became the famous Neapolitan song &quot;Torna a Surriento&quot; (&quot;Come Back to Sorrento&quot;).

==Honours==

<text>Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo (4 March 1901 or 1903 – 22 June 1937), born Joseph-Casimir Rabearivelo, was a Malagasy poet who is widely considered to be Africa&#x27;s first modern poet and the greatest literary artist of Madagascar. Part of the first Malagasy generation raised under French colonization, Rabearivelo grew up impoverished and failed to complete secondary education. His passion for French literature and traditional Malagasy oral poetry (&quot;hainteny&quot;) prompted him to read extensively and educate himself on a variety of subjects, including the French language and its poetic and prose traditions. He published his first poems as an adolescent in local literary reviews, soon obtaining employment at a publishing house where he worked as a proofreader and editor of its literary journals. He published numerous poetry anthologies in French and Malagasy as well as literary critiques, an opera, and two novels.

Rabearivelo&#x27;s early period of modernist-inspired poetry showed skill and attracted critical attention, but adhered strictly to traditional genre conventions. The surrealist poetry he composed beginning in 1931 displayed greater originality, garnering him strong praise and acclaim. Despite increasing critical attention in international poetry reviews, Rabearivelo was never afforded access to the elite social circles of colonial Madagascar. He suffered a series of personal and professional disappointments, including the death of his daughter, the French authorities&#x27; decision to exclude him from the list of exhibitors at the Universal Exposition in Paris, and growing personal debt worsened by his opium addiction and philandering. Following Rabearivelo&#x27;s suicide by cyanide poisoning in 1937, he became viewed as a colonial martyr.

The death of Rabearivelo occurred just prior to the emergence of the &quot;Négritude&quot; movement, by which time the poet had established an international reputation among literary figures such as Léopold Sédar Senghor as Africa&#x27;s first modern poet. The Government of Madagascar named Rabearivelo the national poet upon the establishment of national independence in 1960. His works are a focus of ongoing academic study. Modern Malagasy poets and literary figures including Elie Rajaonarison have cited him as a major inspiration. A street and a high school in Antananarivo have been named after him, and Rabearivelo has a dedicated room in the National Library of Madagascar.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, born Joseph-Casimir on 4 March 1901 or 1903 in Ambatofotsy (north of Antananarivo), Madagascar, was the only child of an unwed mother descended from the &quot;Zanadralambo&quot; (&quot;sons of Ralambo&quot;) caste of the Merina &quot;andriana&quot; (nobles). When the French colonized Madagascar in 1897, Merina nobles including Rabearivelo&#x27;s mother lost the privileges, prestige, and wealth to which they had been entitled under the former monarchy, the Kingdom of Imerina. Madagascar had been a French colony for less than a decade when Rabearivelo was born, situating him among the first generation of Malagasy to grow up under the colonial system. He first studied at the Frères des Écoles Chrétiennes school in the affluent neighborhood of Andohalo, then transferred to the prestigious Collège Saint-Michel, where he was expelled for lack of discipline, poor academic performance, and his reluctance to become religiously observant. He ended his studies at École Flacourt in 1915. He is believed to have published his first poems at age 14 in the literary review &quot;Vakio Ity&quot; under the pen name K. Verbal.

After leaving school, he worked a variety of low-skilled jobs, including as a lace designer, an errand boy, and a secretary and interpreter to a district administrator. During this period he developed a passion for French 19th and 20th century literature and refined his fluency in the French language; he also began teaching himself English, Spanish, and Hebrew. He changed his name to Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo to have the same initials as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, while continuing to occasionally use pseudonyms, including &quot;Amance Valmond&quot; and &quot;Jean Osmé&quot;. He was particularly attracted to poets and writers who were outcasts in their own society, including Baudelaire and Rimbaud.

===Early period===
In 1920, Rabearivelo was hired as an assistant librarian at the &quot;Cercle de l&#x27;Union&quot; social club. That same year he drafted his first book, a short novel written in the Malagasy language. He began to correspond with a wide range of writers around the world, including André Gide, Paul Valéry, Jean Amrouche, Paul Claudel, and Valery Larbaud, and spent large sums to buy books and ship them to Madagascar. By these means he amassed a diverse collection that constituted the richest library on the island. In 1924 he took a job as a proofreader at the publishing house Imprimerie de l&#x27;Imerina, a position he would continue to occupy for the rest of his life. In 1921 he befriended high-level French colonial bureaucrats who shared his passion for French literature, including Robert Boudry, the colony&#x27;s financial manager, and Pierre Camo, Madagascar&#x27;s postal magistrate and founder of the literary magazine &quot;18° Latitude Sud&quot;.

He published his first collection of poems, &quot;La coupe de cendres&quot; (&quot;The Cup of Ashes&quot;) in 1924; the same year he also translated twelve previously unpublished Malagasy language poems into French and published them in literary magazines, including &quot;18° Latitude Sud&quot; in Antananarivo and &quot;La Vie&quot; in Paris. This publication launched him into the intellectual and cultural circles of Antananarivo high society, where he established himself as Madagascar&#x27;s leader not only in poetry and prose, but as an esteemed journalist, art critic, translator, and writer of essays and plays.

In 1925, he wrote a historical novel called &quot;L&#x27;Aube rouge&quot; (&quot;The Red Dawn&quot;) about the last years of the Kingdom of Imerina and the beginning of the Franco-Hova wars. The novel specifically pays tribute to Rainandriamampandry, the governor of Toamasina who was executed by the French in 1896 for his suspected role in the Menalamba rebellion. Rabearivelo published his second and third poetry anthologies, &quot;Sylves&quot; (&quot;Woodlands&quot;) and &quot;Volumes&quot;, in 1927 and 1928 respectively. He also published his second historical novel in 1928, &quot;L&#x27;interférence&quot; (&quot;Interference&quot;), which depicts the life of a noble family from the last years of the Imerina monarchy before French colonization. Throughout the 1920s, he translated the works of foreign poets and writers into Malagasy, including Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Laforgue, Rilke, Whitman, and Góngora; he also translated traditional Malagasy &quot;kabary&quot; (oratory) into French for publication in French-language literary reviews.

In 1926, Rabearivelo married Mary Razafitrimo, the daughter of a local photographer, with whom he would have five children.

===Late period===
In 1931, Rabearivelo&#x27;s lover, the Malagasy writer Esther Razanadrasoa, died after taking abortive substances to terminate a pregnancy by the poet. After her death, Rabearivelo published an obituary telling of their close relationship, and dedicated three poems to her. Throughout the 1930s, Rabearivelo joined with other Malagasy poets and writers in an emerging literary movement termed &quot;Hitady ny Very&quot; (&quot;The Search for Lost Values&quot;), which sought to promote the traditional literary and oral arts of Madagascar. Together with fellow artists Charles Rajoelisolo and Ny Avana Ramanantoanina, in August 1931 he founded a literary journal called &quot;Ny Fandrosoam-baovao&quot; (&quot;New Progress&quot;) to promote Malagasy-language poetry. He published two more anthologies of thirty poems each: &quot;Presque-Songes&quot; (&quot;Dream Images&quot;) (1931) and &quot;Traduit de la nuit&quot; (&quot;Translated from the Night&quot;) (1932). As an experiment, he wrote Malagasy and French versions of each poem in these two books; the French versions were published in 1934 and 1935 respectively. For the remainder of his life he focused primarily on the translation of &quot;hainteny&quot; (traditional Malagasy poetry) into French, work which was published posthumously. He also wrote Madagascar&#x27;s first and only opera, &quot;Imaitsoanala&quot; (1935), named for the legendary heroine mother of King Ralambo; it was set to music composed by Andrianary Ratianarivo and was performed by Ratianarivo&#x27;s Troupe Jeanette at the Municipal Theater of Isotry in Antananarivo.

In 1933, his three-year-old daughter Voahangy became ill and died. Rabearivelo was deeply affected by this loss and was plunged into grief from which he never recovered. His last daughter, who was born in 1936, he named Velomboahangy (&quot;Voahangy Alive&quot;). The theme of death became prominent and recurrent in his works and journal.

The colonial high society of Antananarivo showcased Rabearivelo&#x27;s work as evidence of the success of the French assimilation policy and the beneficial effects of colonialism in Africa. In his journals, the poet wrote that he felt &quot;used&quot; by the French authorities in Madagascar. Governor Montagné awarded him an affiliation (&quot;membre correspondant&quot;) with the &quot;Académie Malgache&quot; in 1932. However, in 1937, Rabearivelo&#x27;s trust in the assimilation messages and gestures of Antananarivo&#x27;s colonial high society was betrayed. He was imprisoned for three days for failing to pay taxes, a penalty from which he should have been exempted due to his status as a low-ranking employee of the colonial administration. He had also been promised that he would represent Madagascar at the 1937 Universal Exposition in Paris, but in May, the colonial authorities informed him that he would not be part of the island&#x27;s delegation. Consequently, Rabearivelo became embittered toward France and its colonial message of assimilation, a sentiment strongly expressed in his journals. He was likewise rejected by Malagasy high society, who condemned his unconventional behavior and views, particularly in light of his role as husband and father. His compatriots also held him in contempt for his perceived eagerness to embrace the French colonial rule and culture.

Rabearivelo was deeply troubled by these disappointments and his worsening chronic financial troubles, in addition to the continuing grief he felt for the death of his daughter. On 19 June 1937, a French friend informed him that his ambition to hold a higher official role within the administrative authority could never materialize as he was largely self-educated and lacked the required diplomas. Having staked his future on a government career, Rabearivelo began to muse about his own death in his journal, writing &quot;Perhaps one needs to die to be found sincere&quot;.

===Death===
Rabearivelo committed suicide by cyanide poisoning on the afternoon of 22 June 1937. He may have been seriously ill with tuberculosis at the time. The morning of his suicide, Rabearivelo completed several unfinished works; he then took fourteen 250-milligram quinine capsules with water at 1:53 pm, followed at 2:37 pm by ten grams of potassium cyanide. Before dying he wrote a final poem and burned the first five volumes of his personal journal, the &quot;Calepins Bleus&quot; (&quot;Blue Notebooks&quot;, 1924–1937), leaving four volumes of approximately 1,800 pages that document his life after 4 January 1933. In his final journal entries he recorded the detailed experience of his suicide, concluding with his final entry at 3:02 pm. At the time of his death, only half of his twenty literary works had been published; the remainder were printed posthumously. His tomb is found in Fieferana.

==Style and influences==
Rabearivelo&#x27;s first poetic work, &quot;La coupe de cendres&quot; (1924), demonstrates the evident mastery of meter and rhythm in his earliest works, despite an absence of innovation on the classic models of poetry he uses. The works that follow this initial effort can be broadly clustered into two phases, the first being highly influenced by the symbolist and romantic schools of poetry, and the second reflecting greater creativity and individuality in personal expression, and with a recurrent interest in reconciling a mental image of a &quot;mythic past&quot; with an &quot;alienating modernity&quot;.

In the romantic period, typified by &quot;Sylves&quot; (1927) and &quot;Volumes&quot; (1928), Rabearivelo&#x27;s poems are shorter and reflect a purer form of traditional models. He identified himself and his work as post-symbolist in the early part of his artistic career. Regarding Rabearivelo&#x27;s works from this period, editor Jacques Rabemananjara acknowledged the poet&#x27;s evident talent but critiqued his over-adherence to form and poetic conventions at the expense of innovation and genuine self-expression.

Beginning in 1931, his works begin to change in tone and show the influences of surrealism and modernism. His poems become more daring, free, and complex, while also reflecting greater doubt. According to academic Arnaud Sabatier, this change reflects &quot;the rediscovery and embrace of the sound and images of traditional Malagasy poetry, from which he had previously distanced himself or which he had subjected to the colonial language and culture&quot;. These later works are described by academic Claire Riffard as &quot;his strangest, evoking rural and commonplace images alongside unexpected dreamlike visions, superimposing the new and the forgotten …&quot; His break from convention in this period offered greater freedom to reconcile his conflicted identity, such as through his bilingual creations, &quot;Presque-Songes&quot; (1931) and &quot;Traduit de la nuit&quot; (1932).

==Legacy==
Rabearivelo has long been considered the first modern poet of Africa. Academic Arnaud Sabatier identifies him as &quot;one of the most important writers of the twentieth century&quot;. He has also been described by Radio France Internationale journalist Tirthankar Chanda as &quot;the founder of the African &quot;francophonie&quot;&quot; and &quot;the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of French literature&quot;. Rabearivelo is the most internationally famous and influential Malagasy literary figure. &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; described him as &quot;Madagascar&#x27;s greatest poet&quot;, a sentiment echoed by Léopold Sédar Senghor, first president of Senegal and founder of the &quot;Négritude&quot; movement, who called him the &quot;prince of the Malagasy poets&quot;. He was described by academic Claire Riffard as &quot;one of the principal founders of contemporary Malagasy literature&quot;, and following national independence in 1960, the government of Madagascar affirmed his cultural contributions by promoting him as the island&#x27;s national writer.

Rabearivelo struggled throughout his life to reconcile his identity as Malagasy with his aspiration toward French assimilation and connection with the greater universal human experience. He has been depicted as a martyr figure as a result of his suicide following the refusal of French authorities to grant him permission to go to France. He has been the subject of a significant number of books and conferences; on the fiftieth anniversary of his death, his work was commemorated at events organized in North America, Europe and Africa, including a week-long conference at the University of Antananarivo. Recent scholarship has questioned Rabearivelo&#x27;s elevation as a colonial martyr, arguing that the poet was by and large an assimilationist who did not view himself as African.

The Lycée Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo was inaugurated in central Antananarivo on 21 December 1946 in honor of the poet. A room has been dedicated to the poet in the National Library of Madagascar, located in the capital city.

He was included in the seminal volume of poetry of the &quot;Négritude&quot; movement, Léopold Senghor&#x27;s &quot;Anthologie de la nouvelle poesie negre et malgache&quot; (&quot;Anthology of New Black and Malagasy Poetry&quot;), published in 1948. He has inspired many Malagasy writers and poets after him, including Elie Rajaonarison, an exemplar of the new wave of Malagasy poetry.

The Francophone University Agency and Madagascar&#x27;s National Center for Scientific Research collaborated to publish the entirety of Rabearivelo&#x27;s works in three volumes. The first volume, comprising his journal and some of his correspondence with key figures in literary and colonial circles, was printed in October 2010. The second volume, a compilation of all his previously published works, was released in July 2012. The remaining 1,000 pages of materials produced by Rabearivelo have been published in digital format. The first complete English translation of his masterpiece &quot;Translated from the Night&quot; was published by Lascaux Editions in 2007.

<text>John Zápolya or Szapolyai (; ; ; ; 1487 – 22 July 1540), was King of Hungary (as John I) from 1526 to 1540. His rule was disputed by Archduke Ferdinand I, who also claimed the title King of Hungary. He was Voivode of Transylvania before his coronation, from 1510 to 1526.

John came from a prominent Croatian-Slavonian noble family. His father became one of Hungary&#x27;s wealthiest lords and served as Palatine of Hungary. During the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1514 led by György Dózsa, John gained influence through his military campaigns and by crushing the revolt, which bolstered his authority and earned him the title of &quot;liberator of the realm.&quot; However, his power declined after his sister Barbara&#x27;s death in 1515. And in 1528, he fled to Poland, later aligning with the Ottomans, leading Hungary to become an Ottoman vassal state.

== Rise of the Szápolya family ==
John was the oldest son of Count Stephen Zápolya and his second wife, Hedwig of Cieszyn. Stephen Zápolya was descended from a Croatian noble family from Slavonia. Their family name was derived from the Croatian phrase &quot;za polje&quot; (literally translated as &quot;behind field&quot;). Stephen became one of the wealthiest lords in the Kingdom of Hungary after inheriting the large domains of his brother, Emeric Zápolya, in 1487. Stephen Zápolya&#x27;s marriage with the Silesian duchess, Hedwig, who was related to Emperor Maximilian I, increased the prestige of the Zápolya family.

=== Habsburg-Jagiellon war of succession===

Stephen Zápolya had no sons when Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, died on 6 April 1490, according to a contemporaneous report, but a charter issued in September 1491 already mentioned John, showing that John was born between the two dates. Stephen Zápolya became Palatine of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1492 until his death in 1499.

Vladislaus&#x27;s brother, King Sigismund Jagiellon of Poland, came to Hungary to mediate between the royal family and the Zápolyas in late June. Emperor Maximilian had already in September declared war on Hungary, because he wanted to protect his claim (acknowledged in the 1491 Peace of Pressburg) to succeed Vladislaus. The teenager Stephen Zápolya was made one of the commanders of the Hungarian army. During the war, the envoys of King Vladislaus and Maximilian signed a secret treaty on 30 March 1506 about the marriage of Vladislaus&#x27;s daughter, Anne Jagiellon, and Maximilian&#x27;s grandson, Ferdinand.

=== Childhood ===
John was born in Szepes Castle (now Spiš Castle in Slovakia), which was an important center of the Zápolyas&#x27; domains. At the Diet of Hungary in 1497, Stephen Zápolya&#x27;s opponents circulated rumours about his intention to have his son crowned king. John and his younger brother, George, inherited their father&#x27;s vast domains in 1499. Their domains were primarily located in Upper Hungary (now Slovakia), where they held most landed estates in five counties. John could write letters in Latin, showing that his mother provided excellent education to him. Hedwig of Cieszyn wanted to persuade Vladislaus II, King of Hungary and Bohemia, to marry his only child, Anne, to John. However king Vladislaus refused the idea of marriage between princess Anne and John Zápolya.

== Party leader of the gentry ==

Zápolya began his public career as a member of the new Diet at Rákos in 1505. On 13 October, the Diet, prompted by Zápolya, passed a bill which prohibited the election of a foreigner as king if Vladislaus died without male issue. The bill was aimed at creating a legal basis for Zápolya&#x27;s ascension to the throne after the death of Vladislaus, but the king refused to ratify it, and the Diet was closed by the king. Moreover, Vladislaus&#x27;s wife, Anne of Foix-Candale, gave birth to a son, Louis, on 1 July 1506.

Zápolya&#x27;s serious conflicts with the royal court had meanwhile made him the leader of a &quot;national party&quot;, consisting of the smaller untitled noblemen (the gentry) who were opposed to the pro-Habsburg orientation of the higher aristocracy, the higher clergy, and King Vladislaus. The Diet initially refused to elect the infant crown prince Louis as successor to Vladislaus, but Louis was finally crowned on Vladislaus&#x27;s demand on 4 June 1508. According to the late 16th-century historian Miklós Istvánffy, when the king returned from Bohemia in early 1510, Zápolya asked Vladislaus for the hand of his daughter Anne, but Vladislaus refused.

== Voivode of Transylvania ==
Vladislaus II made John Zápolya Voivode of Transylvania and Count of the Székelys on 8 November 1510. He moved to Transylvania and took up residence in Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania) in March 1511. The Ottomans invaded the southern frontier of the Kingdom of Hungary in April 1511. John regularly held Diets for the representatives of the &quot;Three Nations of Transylvania&quot;. He also headed the judicial assemblies of the Székely people.

Vladislaus&#x27;s brother, Polish king Sigismund I the Old, married John&#x27;s younger sister, Barbara Zápolya in early 1512. To show off his wealth, John went with Barbara to Poland accompanied by 800 horsemen who wore gilded clothes. This increased the influence of the Zápolyas, but only in the short term, as Barbara died in 1515. John raided Ottoman Bulgaria in summer 1513. After returning to Transylvania, he crushed a revolt in Hermannstadt (now Sibiu, Romania) and forced the townspeople to pay an extraordinary tax.

===Crushing the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1514===
Zápolya launched a new campaign into Bulgaria in early May 1514.
Meanwhile, Tamás Bakócz, Archbishop of Esztergom, declared a Crusade against the Turks on 9 April. About 40,000 peasants joined the crusade and assembled near Pest, although their lords had tried to retain them before the harvest. The &quot;crusade&quot; soon turned into a peasant rebellion. As the peasant army marched toward Turkish territory, they took to plundering nearby noble manors. Many villagers refused to pay taxes and duties. On 22 May, Vladislaus and the Archbishop ordered the peasants to disband, but they refused. Peasant bands took control of the southern lowlands along the rivers Danube and Tisza and murdered many nobles.

The main army of the peasants, commanded by György Dózsa, laid siege to Temesvár (now Timișoara, Romania). Stephen Báthory defended the town. Zápolya, who had returned from his Ottoman campaign, came to relieve Temesvár. His army routed the peasants on 15 July.

The leaders of the revolt were tortured to death with much cruelty. Dózsa was put on a red-hot iron &quot;throne&quot; with a red-hot iron &quot;crown&quot; on his head, and his accomplices were compelled to eat his flesh before being executed. In October, the Diet deprived the peasants of the right to free movement and obliged them to work on their lords&#x27; lands without remuneration one day in every week. 
Zápolya&#x27;s victory over the peasant revolt strengthened his authority in several ways: on the one hand, he had opposed the &quot;crusade&quot; from the beginning, and on the other hand, it gained him support among the petty nobility (gentry).
The Diet hailed Zápolya as the &quot;liberator of the realm&quot; and rewarded him with a payment of 20 denars for each peasant household. Supporters of Zápolya were appointed to the royal council, becoming a majority, and his friend, Gregory Frankopan, Archbishop of Kalocsa, was made chancellor. The previous chancellor, George Szatmári, Archbishop of Esztergom, remained hostile to Zápolya.

Zápolya, Stephen Báthory, Emeric Török, and Michael Paksy joined forces to laid siege to Žrnov, the Ottoman fortress near Nándorfehérvár (now Belgrade, Serbia) in April 1515. However, Sinan, Bey of Smederovo, defeated their united troops. The defeat weakened Zápolya&#x27;s position.

==King of Hungary==

In 1526, the Ottoman Empire crushed the Hungarian royal army in the Battle of Mohács and killed King Louis II. Zápolya was en route to the battlefield with his sizable army but did not participate in the battle for unknown reasons. The Ottomans sacked the royal capital of Buda and occupied Syrmia, then withdrew from Hungary. The last three months of the year were marked by a power vacuum; political authority was in a state of collapse, yet the victors chose not to impose their rule.

Two candidates stepped into the breach. One was Zápolya, &quot;voivode&quot; of Transylvania and Hungary&#x27;s most prominent aristocrat as well as commander of an intact army. The other was Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, the late king&#x27;s brother-in-law and brother of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who claimed Hungary for the House of Habsburg.

The majority of Hungary&#x27;s untitled lesser nobility (the gentry) backed Zápolya, who for fifteen years had been playing a leading role in Hungarian political life. Part of the aristocracy acknowledged his leadership, and he enjoyed the enthusiastic support – not always reciprocated – of the lesser nobility. Most of his opponents succumbed at Mohács: the Hungarian branch of the Jagiellon dynasty became defunct, and its pro-Habsburg following was decimated. The higher nobility of Hungary (the magnates or barons) sided with Ferdinand, and gathered in Pozsony for Ferdinand&#x27;s election. The German dynasty&#x27;s main argument – one that many historians would judge to be decisive – was that the Habsburg dynasty could help Hungary fight against the Ottomans. But in 1526, the promise rang empty. Hungary had been fighting the Ottomans for over a century, during which time the Empire and the Habsburgs had offered much encouragement but no tangible help. The likelihood of assistance was further reduced by the conflict of Ferdinand&#x27;s older brother, Emperor Charles V, and King Francis I of France that once again flared into open war in the summer of 1526. This circumstance led the Voivode to discount the threat lurking behind the Habsburgs&#x27; candidacy: that Zápolya&#x27;s Hungary would have to contend not only with the Ottomans, but also with an attack from the west.

Thus Zápolya took no notice of his rival&#x27;s protests, nor of those voiced by the few Hungarians who rallied to Ferdinand. On 10 November 1526, Zápolya had himself proclaimed king at the Diet at Székesfehérvár by the lesser nobles (gentry), and he was duly crowned the next day. Ferdinand was also elected king by the magnates, barons, and the Catholic clergy in a rump Diet in Pozsony on 17 December 1526.

Profiting from nine months of relative calm, John strove to restore state authority. He drew on his vast private wealth, the unconditional support of the lesser nobility, and the assistance of some aristocrats to impose his policies in domestic affairs. However, in the crucial sphere of foreign relations, success eluded him. He sought an entente with the Habsburgs, proposing to form an alliance against the Ottomans, but Ferdinand rejected all attempts at reconciliation. John&#x27;s envoys fanned out across Europe in quest of support. Only in France did they find a positive response, but even that was ineffective since Francis was intent not on reconciling Hungary and the Habsburgs, but on drawing Hungary into a war against Charles and his family.
Europe&#x27;s political balance underwent a major shift in the summer of 1527, when, in a somewhat unplanned operation, mercenary forces of the emperor occupied Rome and drove Pope Clement VII, one of France&#x27;s principal allies, to capitulate. This development freed Ferdinand – who also acquired the Bohemian throne in late 1526 – from the burden of assisting his brother. By then, Ferdinand had developed a Hungarian policy that was fully in keeping with the interests of his realms. He judged that if Hungary, unable to resist the Ottoman Empire, took action independently of Austria and Bohemia, it might well enter into an alliance with the Ottomans against its western neighbors. It was therefore in the interest of Austria and Bohemia that the Habsburgs gain control of Hungary, by force if necessary.

In July 1527, Ferdinand sent an army of German mercenaries into Hungary. The moment was well chosen, for John Zápolya&#x27;s forces were tied up in the southern counties of Hungary, where Slavonic peasants, incited by Ferdinand, had rebelled; the revolt was led by the &#x27;Black Man&#x27;, Jovan Nenad. In one sweep, the pro-Habsburg soldiers captured Buda. John hurriedly redeployed his army, but on 27 September in the Battle of Tarcal (near Tokaj), he suffered a bloody defeat. Based on the earlier election of the Diet at Pozsony, Ferdinand was crowned in the Székesfehérvár Basilica on 3 November 1527.
In 1528 John fled Hungary for Poland, where he stayed with Prince Jan Amor Tarnowski.

After Szapolyai received no assistance from European rulers to resolve the ongoing war conflict with Ferdinand (only empty promises), he had no choice but to send his envoy, Laszky Jeromos, to Istanbul to seek help. Suleiman I, who had not invaded the country in 1526, now did not want it to fall under Habsburg control. Therefore, alongside military support, he began the actual occupation of Hungarian territories and their annexation to the Ottoman Empire. The sultan sought to force Szapolyai into a vassal relationship, which he later accomplished with Transylvania. This was an old method used by the Ottoman Empire, which had also been applied against Balkan states, such as Serbia, in the 14th and 15th centuries, where they were first compelled into dependency and then annexed in the following decades.

In 1529 John approached the Ottomans, and agreed to make Hungary a vassal state in return for recognition and support. Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent accepted, and sent Ottoman armies to invade Austria (which included the Siege of Vienna), a war which lasted till 1533. This allowed John to regain his position in Hungary in 1529, by the efforts of Frater George Martinuzzi, despite the association with the Ottomans which tainted him at the time. Martinuzzi became royal treasurer and John&#x27;s most trusted minister.

In 1533, the Ottomans made peace and ceded western Hungary to Ferdinand. Ferdinand now began to press John for control of the rest. In 1538, by the Treaty of Nagyvárad, John designated Ferdinand to be his successor after his death, as he was childless. However, in late January to early February 1539, he married Isabella Jagiellon, and on 15 July 1540 they had a son, John Sigismund. King John died seven days later on 22 July 1540 in Szászsebes (Sebeş).

<text>Antonín Zápotocký (; 19 December 1884 – 13 November 1957) was a Czech communist politician and statesman in Czechoslovakia. He served as the Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia from 1948 to 1953, and then as President of Czechoslovakia from 1953 to 1957.

==Biography==
Zápotocký was born in Zákolany, Kingdom of Bohemia, Cisleithania (then in Austria-Hungary, now in the Czech Republic). His father was Ladislav Zápotocký, one of the founders of the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD), together with Josef Boleslav Pecka-Strahovský and Josef Hybeš. Antonín Zápotocký was himself active in the ČSSD from an early age as a party functionary in the Kladno district, and as an editor of the party press. During World War I, he served as a soldier in the Austro-Hungarian Army.

Following the end of the war and the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, Zápotocký emerged as one of the leaders of the left wing of the ČSSD. He was a delegate of the party&#x27;s left wing to the Second World Congress of the Comintern, which was held in Petrograd between 19 July and 7 August 1920. Together with Bohumír Šmeral, he co-founded the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) after the party left broke away from the ČSSD in 1921. He was General Secretary of the KSČ from 1922 to 1925. During the 1930s, Zápotocký focused on trade union work; in 1932, he was among the organizers of a widespread strike in the Most area. Towards the later half of the 1930s, Zápotocký worked to unite the Czechoslovak trade unions on an anti-fascist platform.

After the activities of the KSČ were suppressed under the terms of the Munich Agreement in 1938 and the majority of the party leadership started operating clandestinely, Zápotocký and Jaromír Dolanský represented its official leadership until it was officially banned in December of that year. After the occupation of the Czech lands by Nazi Germany the following year, Zápotocký was arrested in April while illegally trying to cross the border into Poland. After being held in Pankrác Prison in Prague, Zápotocký was then imprisoned in Dresden before being sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1940. as a Kapo.

After the liberation of Sachsenhausen and the end of World War II in 1945, Zápotocký returned to Czechoslovakia, where he was appointed chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions and a member of the presidium of the Central Committee of the KSČ. He was elected to the Interim National Assembly in the same year, and went on to serve as Chairman of the succeeding Constituent National Assembly from 18 June to 18 July 1946.

Zápotocký replaced Klement Gottwald as prime minister on 15 June 1948, when the latter became president. On 14 March 1953, shortly after returning from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#x27;s funeral in Moscow, Gottwald died. As per the Ninth-of-May Constitution, Zápotocký took over most presidential duties, and was formally elected president in his own right a week later.

Zápotocký favoured a more humane way of governing, but was outflanked by the Stalinist First Secretary Antonín Novotný. In May 1953, in the wake of a monetary reform which effectively deprived the farmers and better-paid workers of all their savings, sporadic riots against the communist authorities took place. This occasion gave Novotný a chance to seize the upper hand. At a meeting in Moscow, Zápotocký was told to adhere to &quot;collective leadership&quot; — in effect, give up power to Novotný.

Zápotocký stayed in office until his death in Prague in 1957, making him the second Czechoslovak President to die in office. His body was cremated at Strašnice Crematorium and interred.

Zápotocký wrote several novels, based on the history of the labour movement in Czechoslovakia. Two of these were made into films: &quot;Red Glow Over Kladno&quot; () and &quot;New Warriors Will Rise&quot; ().

<text>Aleksander Zawadzki, alias Kazik, Wacek, Bronek, One (; 16 December 1899 – 7 August 1964) was a Polish communist politician, divisional general of the Polish Army, and the Chairman of the State Council of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic from 1952 until his death in 1964.

== Biography ==
Son of Wawrzyniec, a steelworker and Marianna née Chojkowska. He was born in the Ksawera working group between Będzin and Dąbrowa Górnicza. Thanks to the relatively good material position of the family, he studied at the local elementary school. As a result of an accident suffered by his father, in 1913 he was forced to stop his education and take up a job. After the outbreak of the First World War, he left for agricultural work in Thuringia. He worked there until 1917, when he was arrested for hitting his overseer and sent to the prisoners of war camp in Erfurt. After escaping from there, he found himself in Upper Silesia, where he worked in a coal mine in Bytom and in the steelworks in Siemianowice Śląskie. After the outbreak of the revolution in November 1918 in Germany, he crossed the German-Polish border and settled in Dąbrowa Górnicza, where in December 1918 he volunteered for the Polish Army. He took part in the battles in defense of Lviv, and then in war activities on the Lithuanian-Belarusian Front of the Polish-Bolshevik war. In 1921 he was demobilized as a non-commissioned officer of the Polish Army, after which he returned to Dąbrowa Górnicza. For participating in the fighting in 1920, he was awarded the Cross of Valor.

After returning from the war, he was initially unemployed, and then he worked at the coal mine &quot;Paris&quot; in Dąbrowa Górnicza. There he also encountered the communist movement and joined the Young Communist League of Poland. In 1923 he became a member of the Communist Party of Poland. During this period he was wanted by state police for communist activities. He operated in the Łódź District until 1924, after which he was sent to a party school in Moscow, where he stayed for several weeks. On July 9, 1925, he was arrested in Vilnius on charges of involvement in a murder of a supposed police informant. In December 1925, despite the lack of evidence for his involvement, he was sentenced to six years in prison. He served his sentence in Kielce, Łomża and Drohobych. He left prison on March 2, 1932, and because of illness, was sent to the Soviet Union for treatment. There, he healed and taught at the party school of the WKP (b) and the OGPU near Moscow.

He returned to Poland in 1934. On May 27, 1934, he was arrested in Warsaw. He was detained in custody until February 1935, when he was released on bail. On January 13, 1936, he was arrested again. He was then accused of acting to the detriment of the Republic of Poland. The trial took place on April 4-21, 1938. Along with Zawadzki, who was the main accused, 55 other people were tried. Zawadzki was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. After upholding the judgment of November 23, 1938 by the Court of Appeals, he was imprisoned in Brest. He stayed there until September 1939, when after the Soviet invasion of Poland, the city was occupied by the Red Army. He took up work in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic in the Pinsk district office.

During the Second World War he was active in the foundation of the Union of Polish Patriots and the Polish Workers&#x27; Party, being elected to the Politburo of the latter. He was also a political organiser of the Polish Army in the Soviet Union and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. 

After the war he became the government representative in Silesia, then the voivode of the Silesian-Dąbrowskie Voivodeship. From December 1948 he became a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party. From 1949 to 1952 he was deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers. 

Zawadzki was elected to the Sejm in 1947, and on 20 November 1952, he was appointed chairman of the Polish Council of State, to replace Bolesław Bierut. 

Zawadzki died on 7 August 1964 of cancer at the age of 64 and was buried at the Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw.

<doc id="558197" wikidata="Q22084002" url="?curid=558197" title="Health board (Ireland)">
<text>The health board system of Ireland was created by the 1970 Health Act. This system was initially created with eight health boards, each of which were prescribed a &quot;functional area&quot; in which they operated. The system was reformed in 1999 from eight to eleven regional bodies.

On 1 January 2005, the health boards were replaced by the Health Service Executive.

==Background==
Prior to the advent of the health board system, the Health Act 1947 was the principal legislation on the State&#x27;s role in the provision of healthcare in Ireland; this was the act that served as the legislative basis for the Mother and Child Scheme, which was later withdrawn under Church and medical opposition.

Under the 1947 act, the &quot;health authority&quot; for a functional area was the administrative county or county borough. This reflected the fact that until 1947, the Department of Local Government and Public Health was responsible for public health. The Department of Health was created as a separate Department of State by the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1946.

In 1970, the healthcare system of Ireland was still very much a private and voluntary system with the Catholic Church still retaining effective control of healthcare, in particular, the ownership of hospitals and institutions. Doctors served very much in a sole trader capacity with the state taking few responsibilities beyond the organisation of the provision of healthcare to the disadvantaged.

==Health boards==
In 1970, the Health Boards Regulations were made under the Health Act 1970 and defined among other things the functional area, membership and composition of each health board. Each health board was headed by a chief executive officer and more often assisted by an management team consisting of professionals who were public servants.
:†In 1990, the functional area was changed to explicitly include the Galway City and as a result two board members were added to the board in accordance with the 1990 Health Boards (Amendment) Regulations. This change was due to the city obtaining county borough status on 1 January 1986 and thus the need for representation on the health board which had continued to be responsible for health within the city in the interim period.

===1999 Reforms===

In the late 1990s, the counties of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow represented almost half of the population of the state and had only one health board, the &quot;Eastern Health Board&quot;. The rest of the state was served by seven health boards, each with a designated functional area. The 1999 Health (Eastern Regional Health Authority) Act was introduced and dissolved the Eastern Health Board and created four bodies in its place, thus bringing to eleven the number of regional health authorities and boards.

The Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) was given overall responsibility for the former health board functional area, however the actual provision of services was delegated to three &quot;area health boards&quot;. These area health boards were; the Northern Area Health Board (NAHB), East Coast Area Health Board (ECAHB) and the South-Western Area Health Board (SWAHB).

The functional areas of the area health boards did not correspond exactly to the city and county council boundaries and instead were defined in the First Schedule of the Act. The 1999 Eastern Regional Health Authority (Area Health Boards) Regulations determined the composition of the board of each area health board. The composition of the Eastern Regional Health Authority was determined by the act.

<doc id="558203" wikidata="Q222921" url="?curid=558203" title="Guy Mitchell">
<text>Guy Mitchell (born Albert George Cernik; February 22, 1927 – July 1, 1999) was an American pop singer and actor, successful in his homeland, the UK, and Australia. He sold 44 million records, including six million-selling singles. His best-known songs include &quot;My Heart Cries for You&quot;, &quot;Heartaches by the Number&quot; and &quot;Singing the Blues&quot;.

In the fall of 1957, Mitchell starred on the eponymous ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Guy Mitchell Show&quot;. He also acted in a number of films such as &quot;Those Redheads From Seattle&quot; and &quot;Red Garters&quot;, and appeared on TV as George Romack on the 1961 NBC western detective series &quot;Whispering Smith&quot;, and on the 1990 BBC drama series &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot;.

==Life and career==

Mitchell was born Albert Cernik to Croatian immigrants in Detroit, Michigan. The family moved when he was 11 to Los Angeles where he was signed by Warner Brothers Pictures, to be a child star, and performed on the radio on KFWB in Los Angeles, California. However, his career as a child star failed to take off, and the family moved to San Francisco where, after leaving school, he worked as a saddlemaker, supplementing his income by singing. Dude Martin, who had a country music broadcast in San Francisco, hired him for his band.

Cernik served in the United States Navy for two years in World War II, then sang with Carmen Cavallaro&#x27;s big band. In 1947 he recorded for Decca with Cavallaro&#x27;s band, but left due to food poisoning. He went next to New York City and made records for King Records as Al Grant (one, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, appeared in the Variety charts). He won on the radio show &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; in 1949 as a soloist.

Mitch Miller, in charge of talent at Columbia Records, noticed Cernik in 1950. Cernik joined Columbia and took his new stage name at Miller&#x27;s urging. Mitch Miller originally had intended to record a sentimental ballad called &quot;My Heart Cries for You&quot; and &quot;The Roving Kind&quot; with Frank Sinatra, however, Sinatra was not interested and rejected the songs selected for him to record that day. Given that Miller had already booked the musicians for the recording session, he invited Cernik to come in the evening as a replacement to record the songs. The recording went well, and Miller then told him that he should change his name as Miller could not pronounce the name Cernik. Initially reluctant, he then took Miller&#x27;s name Mitchell, and added Guy as he liked to say &quot;Hi, Guy&quot; in reply to other people&#x27;s &quot;Hello&quot;, and became Guy Mitchell for the record release. &quot;My Heart Cries for You&quot; became Mitchell&#x27;s first hit song, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard charts.

After &quot;My Heart Cries for You&quot;, he had a number of other hits including &quot;Heartaches by the Number&quot;, &quot;Rock-a-Billy&quot; (a crossover into the rock and roll field), and &quot;The Same Old Me&quot;. His biggest hit was &quot;Singing the Blues&quot;, which was number one for 10 weeks in 1956. Bob Merrill wrote a number of hits for Mitchell. 

In the 1950s and 1960s Mitchell acted in such movies as &quot;Those Redheads From Seattle&quot; (1953) and &quot;Red Garters&quot; (1954). He appeared in &quot;Choose a Victim&quot;, a 1961 episode of &quot;Thriller&quot;.

Mitchell&#x27;s popularity waned in the 1960s, although he continued to record songs for a number of labels. In 1990, he appeared in several episodes of the BBC drama series Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart as the fictional country singer Jim Bob O&#x27;May, singing several standards including his own hit &quot;Singing the Blues&quot;.

==Death==
Mitchell died on July 1, 1999, aged 72, at Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada of complications from cancer surgery.

==Tribute==
In 2007, to commemorate what would have been his 80th birthday, the English division of SonyBMG released &quot;The Essential Collection&quot; CD. His song &quot;Heartaches by the Number&quot; was part of the soundtrack of the 2010 video game &quot;&quot;.

<text>Alfredo de Zayas y Alfonso (February 21, 1861 – April 11, 1934), usually known as Alfredo de Zayas under Spanish naming customs and also known as Alfredo Zayas, was a Cuban lawyer, poet and political figure. He served as prosecutor, judge, mayor of Havana, secretary of the Constitutional Convention, senator in 1905, president of the Senate in 1906, Vice President of Cuba from 1909 to 1913 and President of Cuba from May 20, 1921, to May 20, 1925.

==Background==
Born in Havana into an aristocratic family with old sugar plantations, he was the 5th child of Dr. José María de Zayas y Jiménez (1824–1887), a noted lawyer and educator, and Lutgarda Alfonso y Espada (1831–1898). He was brother to Dr. Juan Bruno de Zayas y Alfonso (1867–1896), a medical doctor and revolutionary hero who died in the war for Cuba&#x27;s independence, and of Dr. Francisco de Zayas y Alfonso (1857–1924), Cuba&#x27;s long-time Minister to Paris and Brussels. He also had an illegitimate brother, whose name was lost. As one of the leaders of the Cuban Insurrection of 1895, he ceased using the noble-sounding &quot;de&quot; in his name and became known simply as Alfredo Zayas. Besides his successful legal practice, he was active in Cuban literary circles and was co-editor of the journal &quot;Cuba Literaria&quot;.

==During the last Cuban war for independence==
Zayas was an intellectual, not a military leader, and during the 1895-1898 Cuban War of Independence, he was arrested and sent to prison in the African possession of Ceuta. When deported (September 20. 1896), while in transit to Spain&#x27;s Cárcel Modelo of Madrid, he wrote some of his best poetry, like &quot;Al Caer la Nieve&quot; subsequently published in his Obras Completas, Vol. 1, Poesia. Zayas was sometimes referred to as the &quot;erudite civilian president,&quot; because unlike his predecessor and his successor he did not have experience in the field of battle.

==Political career==
Upon his return to Cuba after the Spanish–Cuban–American War (known in the U.S. as &quot;Spanish–American War&quot;), he became acting mayor of Havana. He was a member of the Constitutional Convention 1901 and became its secretary. A vocal leader of the opposition against the U.S. annexation of Cuba, he voted against the Platt Amendment and against granting naval bases to the United States in Guantánamo and Bahia Honda.

Zayas became leader of the Liberal Party (left-wing) and was elected Vice-president 1908. In the contested, 1916 presidential election in which the populist Liberal Party used violent tactics, he obtained more votes than the pro-U.S. candidate, Cornell graduate General Mario García Menocal. The Chambelona War ensued, which, after some reverses, was won by the Conservative Forces of Garcia Menocal with the covert support of the United States. Zayas surrendered in Cambute near Guanabacoa where it was said he was hiding. The United States provided military support to García Menocal from Guantánamo Naval Base, without formally invoking its right of intervention pursuant to the Platt Amendment, incorporated in the U.S.-Cuba Treaty of 1903. However, the United States only deployed forces in Oriente Province.

Receiving the most votes in the 1920 Cuban general election, which was marred by accusations of election fraud. Zayas was inaugurated as president on May 20, 1921. 

He served only one term, during which he started the process to give the vote to Cuban women (resolution in the Senate, 1921), negotiated the return of Cuban sovereignty over the Isle of Pines (Isla de la Juventud, 2,204 square kilometers) which had been occupied by the U.S. since 1898 (Hay-Quesada Treaty of 1903), obtained a US$50 million loan from J.P. Morgan, and for the first time allowed full freedom of expression and of the press. On 10 October 1922 he launched PWX, the first Cuban radio station.

Although his administration was systematically defamed by the opposition as corrupt, it actually was less corrupt than preceding and subsequent administrations, and Zayas refrained from censoring the press or arresting critics, unlike prior and later Cuban presidents. This brought him the nickname &quot;el Chino&quot; (the Chinaman), because of his stoicism (&quot;la flema de Zayas&quot;) and his &quot;oriental patience&quot;. Sometimes he was also nicknamed &quot;pesetero&quot;, because since his imprisonment in Madrid he had always carried a Spanish Peseta coin in his vest pocket. When he took office in 1921, the country was in bankruptcy, with debts exceeding US$40 million, and sugar prices plummeting from 22 cents to 3 cents per pound. In spite of this, he carried out a number of reforms, particularly in the field of education.

President Zayas, as well as other Cuban administrations, had to struggle with the implications of the Platt Amendment, which resulted in significant U.S. meddling in Cuban&#x27;s financial affairs. Particularly, under the terms of the Platt Amendment, the Zayas administration needed either the implicit or the outright explicit approval of the U.S. when it came to securing large financial loans.

==Family life==
In 1884, Zayas married Margarita Teresa Claudia del Carmen Arrieta y Diago and they had four children, Margarita (1886–1964), Alfredo (1888–1929), Francisco (1889–1934), and Maria-Teresa Zayas Arrieta (1892–1952). In 1914, he married a second time to Maria de la Asuncion Jaen y Planas, who served as Cuba&#x27;s First Lady during Zayas&#x27;s presidency. He had one other child out of wedlock, Alfredo Zayas y Mendez (1916- ).

His great-grandson is the lawyer, UN employee, and historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas.

==Later life==
He did not run for reelection and devoted his last years to giving conferences and pursuing his manifold literary and historical interests, including the publication of his major work, the two-volume &quot;Lexicografia Antillana&quot;, which had seen an earlier edition in 1914, and occupying the post of president of the &quot;Academia de la Historia&quot; until his death. In the next election Gerardo Machado was elected, but turned dictatorial, and after a series of coups that followed when Machado was forced to step down Fulgencio Batista rose to power.

<text>Give Out but Don&#x27;t Give Up is the fourth studio album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream. It was released on 28 March 1994 in the United Kingdom by Creation Records and in the United States by Sire Records. It peaked at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart. Musically, it marked a massive departure from the psychedelic sound of their previous studio album &quot;Screamadelica&quot; (1991) into one influenced by classic rock and blues music. Its cover photo is a cropped version of &quot;Troubled Waters&quot; by American photographer William Eggleston. Eggleston included the album in his 2017 &quot;Pitchfork&quot; list of &quot;the Music That Made Him a Photography Legend.&quot;

The record&#x27;s retro stylings, which were compared to the Rolling Stones and the music of Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, was received with dismay from fans of the acclaimed, genre-bending &quot;Screamadelica&quot; (1991), and was &quot;one of the most reviled records in recent history&quot; according to one critic, although Primal Scream had explored a similarly rootsy sound on their earliest albums.

The album peaked at number 22 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart.

A second version of the album, featuring previously lost recordings, was released in 2018 as &quot;Give Out But Don’t Give Up: The Original Memphis Recordings.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Reviewing &quot;Give Out but Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; for &quot;Select&quot;, Adam Higginbotham praised the band for filtering their &quot;homages, influences and straight-up rip-offs&quot; into a unique album, and applauded them for embracing &quot;such apparently alarmingly unfashionable rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and soul attitudes&quot;, which they said &quot;indicates a wealth of exactly the kind of sneering insubordination needed in a year otherwise dominated by a lethal cocktail of slim leather ties, Blondie B-sides, an imminent BA Robertson revival and ambient house albums&quot;. Mark Bell of &quot;Vox&quot; wrote that due to the band&#x27;s enthusiasm on the project, they were not wearing their influences &quot;too firmly on their sleeves&quot;, saying: &quot;Allowing for &#x27;classic rock&#x27; reference points, this follow-up to 1991&#x27;s heavy &quot;Screamadelica&quot; gets the benefit of the doubt and eventually succeeds on its own stop-the-world-I-wanna-get-off in 1974 terms.&quot; He concluded: &quot;There are people who will say it&#x27;s all been done before, what a load of old cobblers etc., but given time and some decent weather I reckon even they&#x27;ll want a slice.&quot;

Less favourably, Paul Lester of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote that whereas &quot;Screamadelica&quot; was an &quot;exceptional&quot; album, &quot;&quot;Give Out but Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, the second most feverishly anticipated record of the last three years, is absolutely f***ing dreadful.&quot; He wrote that listeners should not expect any &quot;expansionist&quot; dance-rock collisions, as &quot;Bobby Gillespie may have a staggeringly diverse record collection, but &quot;Give Out...&quot; is dismally one-dimensional. And it&#x27;s a dimension called &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;. God knows I wanted to ignore the weight of historical baggage on my shoulders, and of course I assume most of you are so young you barely remember &quot;Bummed&quot;, let alone &quot;Let It Bleed&quot;, but it has to be said: this is preposterous.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Lorraine Ali criticised the group for mimicking the Rolling Stones and their formula of &quot;blues-based acoustic ballads and sassy, strutting pop numbers, with an occasional country twang thrown in&quot;, writing that Primal Scream &quot;should have stuck to its innovative blend of new and old. The band might have intended this derivative sound to be ironic, but it’s just mediocre rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll with no soul or substance.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; writer Eric Weisbard similarly criticised the album for being derivative and sounding like a &quot;musical lab experiment&quot; without a band feel.

A month after release, &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;1994&#x27;s MOST controversial LP – either a retro cop-out or an achingly sincere homage to the American Deep South&#x27;s wellspring of boogie, blues and soul. It made more sense live, and the release of some ace, mournful singles from &quot;Give Out...&quot; should convince any floating voters.&quot; In June 1994, Steven Daly of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that the record (&quot;an unabashed celebration of rock&#x27;s rich tapestry&quot;) had encouraged music critics to lampoon the group as &quot;retro-rock turncoats peddling reheated boogie a la the 73 Rolling Stones and flying in the face of progress.&quot; He added: &quot;What makes the band&#x27;s alleged crime doubly egregious is its perceived abdication of its role as dance-rock avatar — one of the most innovative outfits of its era.&quot; 

===Retrospective=== 

In 1999, Tom Ewing of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; included &quot;Rocks&quot; at number 97 in his list of the &quot;Top 100 Singles of the 90s&quot;, but noted his original distaste for the song and reflected on the initial reaction to the album: 
Retrospectively, AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;What do you do when you redefine the parameters of modern music? If you&#x27;re Primal Scream, you decide to head to Memphis to tap into the vein of Real American Music,&quot; comparing this move to U2&#x27;s &quot;Rattle &amp; Hum&quot; (1988). He considered the album to be misconceived and &quot;hampered by the group&#x27;s stylized idolization&quot;, criticising them for becoming &quot;pastiche artists&quot; and adding: &quot;At this point, everything existed on the surface for Primal Scream ... So, &quot;Give Out But Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; is a mess, a record that suggests it&#x27;s on the verge of delivering a good time but winds up being a dirgey bummer.&quot; &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; contributor Rob Sheffield also commented on the stylistic shift, writing that the group &quot;pretended to be shit-talking blues rockers&quot;. He considered the album to be silly &quot;but good fun&quot;. In 2000, &quot;Spin&quot; called it &quot;an unconvincing foray into Black Crowes-style rock&#x27;n&#x27;soul&quot;.

Colin Larkin of &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; wrote that despite its &quot;frosty&quot; critical reception, &quot;Give Out&quot; showcased how &quot;Gillespie had once again reinvented himself and his band.&quot; Martin C. Strong of &quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot; considered the album to be an inevitable disappointment next to the unsurpassed &quot;sheer breadth of vision&quot; of &quot;Screamadelica&quot;, noting that the group tried &quot;far too hard to achieve a roughshod R&amp;B grit. Where before they had made the Stones&#x27; sound their own, now they had come across as mere plagiarists, and over-produced plagiarists at that.&quot; He did however note that &quot;Jailbird&quot; and &quot;Rocks&quot; were funkier than &quot;any of the insipid indie competition around at that time&quot;, and noted that Gillespie&#x27;s &quot;epileptic handclap routine&quot; was more endearing than typical rock posturing. Chris Wright of &quot;Rock: The Rough Guide&quot; wrote that although the record inevitably disappointed those &quot;who wanted another &quot;Screamadelica&quot;&quot;, the album is, if judged on its own merits, a &quot;superb&quot; R&amp;B album that is &quot;filled with uncluttered, soulful rock songs.&quot; He praised Gillespie&#x27;s voice for lifting the material and noted how &quot;the huge cast of musicians never put a foot wrong, playing as if their lives depended on it.&quot;

==The Original Memphis Recordings==

In October 2018, the band released &quot;Give Out But Don’t Give Up: The Original Memphis Recordings&quot; featuring original mixes of tracks recorded by producer Tom Dowd at Ardent Studios, Memphis, with the Muscle Shoals rhythm section in 1993.

Aware of the success of Screamadelica, Creation Records&#x27; Alan McGee &quot;thought the Memphis sessions too flat.&quot; As a result, the tracks were subsequently re-worked for the official 1994 release of the album, and the original recordings remained forgotten until guitarist Andrew Innes rediscovered the tapes in his basement.

Critical response to the Memphis release was positive, with God Is In The TV describing the collection as &quot;a restrained, heartfelt, tearjerking tribute to the classic Muscle Shoals sound and very possibly the best album of [Primal Scream&#x27;s] career.&quot;

Discussing hearing the material after 25 years, Bobby Gillespie said it &quot;sounded really beautiful, really clear, well-produced; incredibly performed by all the players and musicians and singers… I was blown away when I heard it.&quot;

The story behind the rediscovery of the tapes was explored in the documentary, &quot;Primal Scream: The Lost Memphis Tapes&quot;.

<text>United Nations [[List of the UN resolutions concerning Israel|Security Council Resolution]] 478, adopted on 20 August 1980, is the last of seven UNSC resolutions condemning Israel&#x27;s annexation of East Jerusalem. UNSC res 478 notes Israel&#x27;s non-compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 476 and condemned Israel&#x27;s 1980 Jerusalem Law which declared Jerusalem to be Israel&#x27;s &quot;complete and united&quot; capital, as a violation of international law. The resolution states that the council will not recognize this law, and calls on member states to accept the decision of the council. This resolution also calls upon member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from the city. The UNSC resolutions followed two General Assembly resolutions regarding Israel&#x27;s actions in East Jerusalem.

The resolution was passed with 14 votes to none against, with the United States abstaining.

==Reception and criticism==
Israel categorically rejected the resolution and its Foreign Ministry announced &quot;It will not undermine the status of Jerusalem as the capital of a sovereign Israel and as a united city which will never again be torn apart&quot;.

In remarks made to the council, then-U.S. Secretary of State Edmund Muskie said &quot;The question of Jerusalem must be addressed in the context of negotiations for a comprehensive, just and lasting Middle East peace.&quot;

With respect to the section of the draft resolution relating to the transfer of embassies from Jerusalem, the Secretary of State said that the resolution was &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; and that the U.S. considered that the instruction that states remove their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem, &quot;not binding&quot; and &quot;without force&quot;, and that &quot;we reject it as a disruptive attempt to dictate to other nations.&quot; He also said that the United States would forcefully resist any attempt to impose sanctions on Israel under Chapter VII of the Charter.

Shlomo Slonim said that despite its forceful tone, Muskie&#x27;s statement did not really elucidate the American position on Jerusalem. It made no reference to Jerusalem as an occupied territory, but neither did it deny such a status. He noted that America&#x27;s policy regarding Jerusalem at the end of 1980 continued to be marked by a considerable degree of ambiguity and confusion.

==Decisions regarding illegal situations==

Two of the decisions contained in the resolution concerned the illegality of the Basic Law Jerusalem and violations of the Geneva Convention which are regarded as serious violations of customary international law. The Repertory of Practice of United Nations Organs is a legal publication, which analyzes and records the decisions of the UN organs. It states that the decisions were adopted by the Security Council acting on behalf of the members under Article 24. Although they were not adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter, the organization considers determinations regarding illegal situations to be binding upon all of its members. The Repertory says: &quot;The question whether Article 24 confers general powers on the Security Council ceased to be a subject of discussion following the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice rendered on 21 June 1971 in connection with the question of Namibia (ICJ Reports, 1971, page 16).&quot;

The subsequent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice expressed the view that all States are under an obligation not to recognize the illegal situation in and around East Jerusalem.

Most nations with embassies in Jerusalem relocated their embassies to Tel Aviv, Ramat Gan or Herzliya following the adoption of Resolution 478. Following the withdrawals of Costa Rica and El Salvador in August 2006, no country maintained its embassy in Jerusalem until May 2018. Following President Trump&#x27;s announcement in December 2017, the United States relocated their embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on 14 May 2018.

<text>The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS 1), short for Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, was adopted in February 2003 by the European Union.

The initiative was to limit the amount of hazardous chemicals in electronics.

The RoHS 1 directive took effect on 1 July 2006, and is required to be enforced and became a law in each member state. This directive restricts (with exceptions) the use of ten hazardous materials in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment. In addition to the exceptions, there are exclusions for products such as solar panels. It is closely linked with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) 2002/96/EC (now superseded) which sets collection, recycling and recovery targets for electrical goods and is part of a legislative initiative to solve the problem of huge amounts of toxic electronic waste. In speech, RoHS is often spelled out, or pronounced , , , or , and refers to the EU standard, unless otherwise qualified.

== Details ==
Each European Union member state will adopt its own enforcement and implementation policies using the directive as a guide.

RoHS is often referred to as the &quot;lead-free directive&quot;, but it restricts the use of the following ten substances:

# Lead (Pb)
# Mercury (Hg)
# Cadmium (Cd)
# Hexavalent chromium (Cr6+)
# Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB)
# Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE)
# Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)
# Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP)
# Dibutyl phthalate (DBP)
# Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)

Maximum Permitted Concentration: 0.1%

Max for Cadmium: 0.01%

DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP were added as part of DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/863 which was published on 31 March 2015.

PBB and PBDE are flame retardants used in several plastics. Hexavalent chromium is used in chrome plating, chromate coatings and primers, and in chromic acid.

The maximum permitted concentrations in non-exempt products are 0.1% or 1000 ppm (except for cadmium, which is limited to 0.01% or 100 ppm) by weight. The restrictions are on each &quot;homogeneous material&quot; in the product, which means that the limits do not apply to the weight of the finished product, or even to a component, but to any single material that could (theoretically) be separated mechanically – for example, the sheath on a cable or the tinning on a component lead.

As an example, a radio is composed of a case, screws, washers, a circuit board, speakers, etc. The screws, washers, and case may each be made of homogenous materials, but the other components comprise multiple sub-components of many different types of material. For instance, a circuit board is composed of a bare printed circuit board (PCB), integrated circuits (IC), resistors, capacitors, switches, etc. A switch is composed of a case, a lever, a spring, contacts, pins, etc., each of which may be made of different materials. A contact might be composed of a copper strip with a surface coating. A loudspeaker is composed of a permanent magnet, copper wire, paper, etc.

Everything that can be identified as a homogeneous material must meet the limit. So if it turns out that the case was made of plastic with 2,300 ppm (0.23%) PBB used as a flame retardant, then the entire radio would fail the requirements of the directive.

In an effort to close RoHS 1 loopholes, in May 2006 the European Commission was asked to review two currently excluded product categories (monitoring and control equipment, and medical devices) for future inclusion in the products that must fall into RoHS compliance. In addition the commission entertains requests for deadline extensions or for exclusions by substance categories, substance location or weight. New legislation was published in the official journal in July 2011 which supersedes this exemption.

Note that batteries are not included within the scope of RoHS. However, in Europe, batteries are under the European Commission&#x27;s 1991 Battery Directive (91/157/EEC), which was increased in scope and approved in the new battery directive, version 2003/0282 COD, which will be official when submitted to and published in the EU&#x27;s Official Journal. While the first Battery Directive addressed possible trade barrier issues brought about by disparate European member states&#x27; implementation, the new directive more explicitly highlights improving and protecting the environment from the negative effects of the waste contained in batteries. It also contains a programme for more ambitious recycling of industrial, automotive, and consumer batteries, gradually increasing the rate of manufacturer-provided collection sites to 45% by 2016. It also sets limits of 5 ppm mercury and 20 ppm cadmium to batteries except those used in medical, emergency, or portable power-tool devices. Though not setting quantitative limits on quantities of lead, lead–acid, nickel, and nickel–cadmium in batteries, it cites a need to restrict these substances and provide for recycling up to 75% of batteries with these substances. There are also provisions for marking the batteries with symbols in regard to metal content and recycling collection information.

The directive applies to equipment as defined by a section of the WEEE directive. The following numeric categories apply:
# Large household appliances
# Small household appliances
# IT &amp; telecommunications equipment (although infrastructure equipment is exempt in some countries)
# Consumer equipment
# Lighting equipment – including light bulbs
# Electronic and electrical tools
# Toys, leisure, and sports equipment
# Medical devices (exemption removed in July 2011)
# Monitoring and control instruments (exemption removed in July 2011)
# Automatic dispensers
#Other EEE not covered by any of the categories above.

It does not apply to fixed industrial plant and tools. Compliance is the responsibility of the company that puts the product on the market, as defined in the Directive; components and sub-assemblies are not responsible for product compliance. Of course, given the fact that the regulation is applied at the homogeneous material level, data on substance concentrations needs to be transferred through the supply chain to the final producer. An IPC standard has recently been developed and published to facilitate this data exchange, IPC-1752. It is enabled through two PDF forms that are free to use.

RoHS applies to these products in the EU whether made within the EU or imported. Certain exemptions apply, and these are updated on occasion by the EU.

===Examples of product components containing restricted substances===
RoHS restricted substances have been used in a broad array of consumer electronics products. Examples of components that have contained lead include:
* paints and pigments
* PVC (vinyl) cables as a stabiliser (e.g., power cords, USB cables)
* solders
* printed circuit board finishes, leads, internal and external interconnects
* glass in television and photographic products (e.g., CRT television screens and camera lenses)
* metal parts
* lamps and bulbs
* batteries
* integrated circuits or microchips

Cadmium is found in many of the components above; examples include plastic pigmentation, nickel–cadmium (NiCd) batteries and CdS photocells (used in night lights). Mercury is used in lighting applications and automotive switches; examples include fluorescent lamps and mercury tilt switches (these are rarely used nowadays). Hexavalent chromium is used for metal finishes to prevent corrosion. Polybrominated biphenyls and diphenyl ethers/oxides are used primarily as flame retardants.

=== Hazardous materials and the high-tech waste problem ===
RoHS and other efforts to reduce hazardous materials in electronics are motivated in part to address the global issue of consumer electronics waste. As newer technology arrives at an ever-increasing rate, consumers are discarding their obsolete products sooner than ever. This waste ends up in landfills and in countries like China to be &quot;recycled&quot;.

In the fashion-conscious mobile market, 98 million U.S. cell phones took their last call in 2005. All told, the EPA estimates that in the U.S. that year, between 1.5 and 1.9 million tons of computers, TVs, VCRs, monitors, cell phones, and other equipment were discarded. If all sources of electronic waste are tallied, it could total 50 million tons a year worldwide, according to the UN Environment Programme.

American electronics sent offshore to countries like Ghana in West Africa under the guise of recycling may be doing more harm than good. Not only are adult and child workers in these jobs being poisoned by heavy metals, but these metals are returning to the U.S. &quot;The U.S. right now is shipping large quantities of leaded materials to China, and China is the world&#x27;s major manufacturing center,&quot; Dr. Jeffrey Weidenhamer says, a chemistry professor at Ashland University in Ohio. &quot;It&#x27;s not all that surprising things are coming full circle and now we&#x27;re getting contaminated products back.&quot;

=== Changing toxicity perceptions ===
In addition to the high-tech waste problem, RoHS reflects contemporary research over the past 50 years in biological toxicology that acknowledges the long-term effects of low-level chemical exposure on populations. New testing is capable of detecting much smaller concentrations of environmental toxicants. Researchers are associating these exposures with neurological, developmental, and reproductive changes.

RoHS and other environmental laws are in contrast to historical and contemporary law that seek to address only acute toxicology, that is direct exposure to large amounts of toxic substances causing severe injury or death.

=== Life-cycle impact assessment of lead-free solder ===
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of the environmental impacts of lead-free and tin–lead solder, as used in electronic products. For bar solders, when only lead-free solders were considered, the tin/copper alternative had the lowest (best) scores. For paste solders, bismuth/tin/silver had the lowest impact scores among the lead-free alternatives in every category except non-renewable resource consumption. For both paste and bar solders, all of the lead-free solder alternatives had a lower (better) LCA score in toxicity categories than tin/lead solder. This is primarily due to the toxicity of lead, and the amount of lead that leaches from printed wiring board assemblies, as determined by the leachability study conducted by the partnership. The study results are providing the industry with an objective analysis of the life-cycle environmental effects of leading candidate alternative lead-free solders, allowing industry to consider environmental concerns along with the traditionally evaluated parameters of cost and performance. This assessment is also allowing industry to redirect efforts toward products and processes that reduce solders&#x27; environmental footprint, including energy consumption, releases of toxic chemicals, and potential risks to human health and the environment. Another life-cycle assessment by IKP, University of Stuttgart, shows similar results to those of the EPA study.

===Life-cycle impact assessment of BFR-free plastics===
The ban on concentrations of brominated flame retardants (BFR) above 0.1% in plastics has affected plastics recycling. As more and more products include recycled plastics, it has become critical to know the BFR concentration in these plastics, either by tracing the origins of the recycled plastics to establish the BFR concentrations, or by measuring the BFR concentrations from samples. Plastics with high BFR concentrations are costly to handle or to discard, whereas plastics with levels below 0.1% have value as recyclable materials.

There are a number of analytical techniques for the rapid measurement of BFR concentrations. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy can confirm the presence of bromine (Br), but it does not indicate the BFR concentration or specific molecule. Ion attachment mass spectrometry (IAMS) can be used to measure BFR concentrations in plastics. The BFR ban has significantly affected both upstream (plastic material selection) and downstream (plastic material recycling).

=== 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2) ===
The RoHS 2 directive (2011/65/EU) is an evolution of the original directive and became law on 21 July 2011 and took effect on 2 January 2013. It addresses the same substances as the original directive while improving regulatory conditions and legal clarity. It requires periodic re-evaluations that facilitate gradual broadening of its requirements to cover additional electronic and electrical equipment, cables and spare parts. The CE logo now indicates compliance and RoHS 2 declaration of conformity is now detailed (see below).

In 2012, a final report from the European Commission revealed that some EU Member States considered all toys under the scope of the primary RoHS 1 Directive 2002/95/EC, irrespective of whether their primary or secondary functions were using electric currents or electromagnetic fields. From the implementation of RoHS 2 or RoHS Recast Directive 2011/65/EU on, all the concerned Member States will have to comply with the new regulation.

The key difference in the recast is that it is now necessary to demonstrate conformity in a similar way to the LVD and EMC directives. Not being able to show compliance in sufficiently detailed files, and not ensuring it is implemented in production is now a criminal offence. Like the other CE marking directives it mandates production control and traceability to the technical files. It describes two methods of achieving presumption of conformity (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 16.2), either technical files should include test data for all materials or a standard accepted in the official journal for the directive, is used. Currently the only standard is EN IEC 63000:2018 (based on IEC 63000:2016 superseded EN 50581:2012), a risk based method to reduce the amount of test data required (Harmonised Standards list for RoHS2, OJEU C363/6).

One of the consequences of the requirement to demonstrate conformity is the requirement to know the exemption use of each component, otherwise it is not possible to know compliance when the product is placed on the market, the only point in time the product must be &#x27;compliant&#x27;. Many do not understand that &#x27;compliance&#x27; varies depending on what exemptions are in force and it is quite possible to make a non-compliant product with &#x27;compliant&#x27; components. Compliance must be calculated on the day of placing on the market. In reality this means knowing the exemption status of all components and using up stock of old status parts before the expire date of the exemptions (Directive 2011/65/EU Article 7.b referring to Decision 768/2008/EC Module A Internal production control). Not having a system to manage this could be seen as a lack of diligence and a criminal prosecution could occur (UK Instrument 2012 N. 3032 section 39 Penalties).

RoHS 2 also has a more dynamic approach to exemptions, creating an automatic expiration if exemptions are not renewed by requests from industry. Additionally new substances can be added to the controlled list, with 4 new substances expected to be controlled by 2019. All these mean greater information control and update systems are required. 

Other differences include new responsibilities for importers and distributors and markings to improve traceability to the technical files. These are part of the NLF for directives and make the supply chain a more active part of the policing (Directive 2011/65/EU Articles 7, 9, 10).

There has been a recent additional amendment 2017/2102 to 2011/65

=== 2015/863 (RoHS 2 amendment) ===

The RoHS 2 directive (2011/65/EU) contains allowance to add new materials and 4 materials are highlighted for this attention in the original version, the amendment 2015/863 adds four additional substances to Annex II of 2011/65/EU (3/4 of the new restrictions are recommended for investigation in the original directive, ref Para 10 of preamble). This is another reason that simple component RoHS compliance statements are not acceptable as compliance requirements vary depending on the date the product is placed on the market (ref IEC 63000:2016). The additional four substances restriction and evidence requirements shall be applied for products placed on the market on or after 22 July 2019 except where exemptions permit as stated in Annex III., although at the time of writing no exemptions exist or have been applied for, for these materials. 
The four additional substances are
# Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)
# Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP)
# Dibutyl phthalate (DBP)
# Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP)
The maximum permitted concentrations in non-exempt products are 0.1%.

The new substances are also listed under the REACH Candidate list, and DEHP is not authorised for manufacturing (use as a substance) in the EU under Annex XIV of REACH.

==Scope exclusions==
With the recast of the original RoHS (I) Directive (2002/95/EC), the scope of the directive was decoupled from the scope of the WEEE Directive and an open scope was introduced. The RoHS (II) Directive (2011/65/EU) was applicable to all electrical and electronic equipment. Scope limitations and exclusions were specifically introduced in Article 2(4) a) – j) of the recast Directive. All other EEE was in scope of the Directive, unless specific exemptions have been granted through Commission delegated acts (see next paragraph).

The scope exclusions are listed below 

This Directive does not apply to:

==Restriction exemptions==

There are over 80 exemptions, some of which are quite broad. Exemptions will automatically expire after 5 or 7 years unless renewed.

According to Hewlett-Packard: &quot;The European Union is gradually narrowing the scope of and expiring many of the current RoHS exemptions. In addition, it is likely that new substance restrictions will be introduced in the next several years.&quot;

Some exemptions:

* Lead as an alloying element in steel containing up to 0.35% lead by weight, aluminium containing up to 0.4% lead by weight, and copper alloy containing up to 4% lead by weight is permitted. (Category 6c)
* Lead in high melting temperature type solders (i.e. lead-based solder alloys containing 85% or more lead by weight). (Category 7a)
* &quot;Lead in solders for servers, storage and storage array systems, network infrastructure equipment for switching, transmission, and network management for telecommunications.&quot; (Category 7b)
* Limited amounts of mercury in fluorescent and other light bulbs where it is essential to their functioning comprise RoHS 2 Categories 1, 2, 3, and 4

Medical devices were exempt in the original directive. RoHS 2 narrowed the exemption&#x27;s scope to &quot;active implantable&quot; medical devices only (Category 4h). In vitro diagnostic devices (IVDD) and other medical devices are now included.

Automotive vehicles are exempt (Category 4f). Vehicles instead are addressed in the End of Life Vehicles Directive (Directive 2000/53/EC).

== Detecting RoHS Compounds with XRF ==
X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) helps detect hazardous substances restricted under the RoHS directive. It identifies heavy metals like lead, mercury, and cadmium quickly and efficiently. XRF works best for inorganic elements, making it a popular tool for compliance testing.

=== How XRF Works ===
XRF uses X-rays to excite atoms in a sample. When atoms stabilize, they release energy as photons. The device measures this energy to identify elements in the sample. Each element emits a unique energy, allowing precise detection. XRF creates an energy spectrum showing what elements are present and how much of each exists. This data supports both qualitative and quantitative analysis.

=== XRF for RoHS Testing ===
XRF effectively detects key RoHS-restricted elements like lead, mercury, and cadmium. It can also find chromium but cannot tell if it’s hexavalent chromium. Additional tests are necessary for that. However, XRF cannot analyze organic compounds such as phthalates or PBBs. XRF can detect total bromine which works as a pre-screening method. However, these substances require other methods like gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for precise detection.

XRF offers many advantages. It’s fast and non-destructive, meaning samples remain intact after analysis. It works well for solid materials with minimal preparation, saving time and reducing costs. Handheld XRF devices allow on-site testing, making them useful in industrial and environmental settings. These devices analyze samples in seconds, increasing efficiency.

=== Limits of XRF ===
XRF struggles to detect light elements like carbon or oxygen. It also cannot analyze molecules or organic substances. Despite these limits, XRF remains a top choice for detecting heavy metals and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations like RoHS.

== Labeling and documentation ==
Products within scope of the RoHS 2 directive must display the CE mark, the manufacturers name and address and a serial or batch number. Parties needing to know more detailed compliance information can find this on the EU Declaration of Conformity for the product as created by the manufacturer (Brand owner) responsible for the design or the EU representative. The regulation also requires most actors in the supply chain for the product (importer and distributors) to keep and check this document, as well as ensuring a conformance process has been followed and the correct language translation for instructions are provided. The manufacturer must keep certain documentation to demonstrate conformity, known as a technical file or technical records. The directive requires the manufacturer to demonstrate conformity by the use of test data for all materials or by following a harmonised standard (IEC 63000:2016 is the only standard at the time of writing). Regulators may request this file or, more likely, specific data from it as it will likely be very large.

=== History ===

RoHS did not require any specific product labelling, but many manufacturers have adopted their own compliance marks to reduce confusion. Visual indicators have included explicit &quot;RoHS compliant&quot; labels, green leaves, check marks, and &quot;PB-Free&quot; markings. Chinese RoHS labels, a lower case &quot;e&quot; within a circle with arrows, can also imply compliance.
RoHS 2 attempts to address this issue by requiring the aforementioned CE mark whose use is policed by the Trading Standards enforcement agency. It states that the &quot;only&quot; permitted indication of RoHS compliance is the CE mark.
The closely related WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive), which became law simultaneously with RoHS, depicts a waste-can logo with an &quot;X&quot; through it and often accompanies the CE mark.

==Future possible additions==
New substance restrictions being considered for introduction in the next few years include phthalates, brominated flame retardants (BFRs), chlorinated flame retardants (CFRs), and PVC.

==Other regions==
===Asia / Pacific===
;China Order No. 39: Final Measures for the &quot;Administration of the Control and Electronic Information Products&quot; (often referred to as &quot;China RoHS&quot;) has the stated intent to establish similar restrictions, but in fact takes a very different approach. Unlike EU RoHS, where products in specified categories are included unless specifically excluded, there will be a list of included products, known as the &quot;catalogue&quot; – see Article 18 of the regulation – which will be a subset of the total scope of Electronic Information Products, or EIPs, to which the regulations apply. Initially, products that fall under the covered scope must provide markings and disclosure as to the presence of certain substances, while the substances themselves are not (yet) prohibited. There are some products that are EIPs, which are not in scope for EU RoHS, &quot;e.g.&quot; radar systems, semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, photomasks, etc. The list of EIPs is available in Chinese and English. The marking and disclosure aspects of the regulation were intended to take effect on 1 July 2006, but were postponed twice to 1 March 2007. There is no timeline for the catalogue yet.
;Japan: Japan does not have any direct legislation dealing with the RoHS substances, but its recycling laws have spurred Japanese manufacturers to move to a lead-free process in accordance with RoHS guidelines. A ministerial ordinance &quot;Japanese industrial standard for Marking of Specific Chemical Substances&quot; (J-MOSS), effective from 1 July 2006, directs that some electronic products exceeding a specified amount of the nominated toxic substances must carry a warning label.
;South Korea: South Korea promulgated the &quot;Act for Resource Recycling of Electrical and Electronic Equipment and Vehicles&quot; on 2 April 2007. This regulation has aspects of RoHS, WEEE, and ELV.

===United States===
The Consumer Product Safety Act was enacted in 1972 followed by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act in 2008.

California has passed the Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003 (EWRA). This law prohibits the sale of electronic devices after 1 January 2007, that are prohibited from being sold under the EU RoHS directive, but across a much narrower scope that includes LCDs, CRTs, and the like and only covers the four heavy metals restricted by RoHS. EWRA also has a restricted material disclosure requirement.

Effective 1 January 2010, the California Lighting Efficiency and Toxics Reduction Act applies RoHS to general purpose lights, i.e. &quot;lamps, bulbs, tubes, or other electric devices that provide functional illumination for indoor residential, indoor commercial, and outdoor use.&quot;

Other US states and cities are debating whether to adopt similar laws, and there are several states that have mercury and PBDE bans already.

=== United Kingdom ===
On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom completed its withdrawal from the European Union and subsequently entered a transition phase spanning from February 1 to December 31, 2020. This event is commonly referred to as Brexit. During this transitional period, the United Kingdom conducted a comprehensive assessment of various regulations, including RoHS. UK RoHS stays well aligned with EU RoHS, with similar scopes, restricted substances, thresholds, and exemptions.

===Ireland===
Worldwide standards and certification are available under the QC 080000 standard, governed by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, to ensure the control of hazardous substances in industrial applications.

===Sweden===
In 2012 Sweden&#x27;s Chemicals Agency (Kemi) and Electrical Safety Authority tested 63 consumer electronics products and found that 12 were out of compliance. Kemi claims that this is similar to testing results from prior years. &quot;Eleven products contained prohibited levels of lead, and one of polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants. Details of seven companies have been passed to Swedish prosecutors. Kemi says that levels of non-compliance with RoHS are similar to previous years, and remain too high.&quot;

== Other standards ==
RoHS is not the only environmental standard of which electronic product developers should be aware. Manufacturers will find that it is cheaper to have only a single bill of materials for a product that is distributed worldwide, instead of customising the product to fit each country&#x27;s specific environmental laws. Therefore, they develop their own standards, which allow only the strictest of all allowable substances.

For example, IBM forces each of their suppliers to complete a Product Content Declaration form to document compliance to their environmental standard &#x27;Baseline Environmental Requirements for Materials, Parts and Products for IBM Logo Hardware Products&#x27;. Thus, IBM banned DecaBDE, even though there was formerly a RoHS exemption for this material (overturned by the European Court in 2008).

Similarly, here is Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s environmental standard.

== Criticism ==
Adverse effects on product quality and reliability, plus high cost of compliance (especially to small business) are cited as criticisms of the directive, as well as early research indicating that the life cycle benefits of lead-free solder versus traditional solder materials are mixed.

Criticism earlier on came from an industry resistant to change and a misunderstanding of solders and soldering processes. Deliberate misinformation was espoused to resist what was perceived as a &quot;non-tariff barrier created by European bureaucrats.&quot; Many believe the industry is stronger now through this experience and has a better understanding of the science and technologies involved.

One criticism of RoHS is that the restriction of lead and cadmium does not address some of their most prolific applications, while being costly for the electronics industry to comply with . Specifically, the total lead used in electronics makes up only 2% of world lead consumption, while 90% of lead is used for batteries (covered by the battery directive, as mentioned above, which requires recycling and limits the use of mercury and cadmium, but does not restrict lead). Another criticism is that less than 4% of lead in landfills is due to electronic components or circuit boards, while approximately 36% is due to leaded glass in cathode-ray tube monitors and televisions, which can contain up to 2 kg per screen. This study was done right after the tech boom.

The more common lead-free solder systems have a higher melting point, e.g. a 30 °C typical difference for tin-silver-copper alloys, but wave soldering temperatures are approximately the same at ~255 °C; however at this temperature most typical lead-free solders have longer wetting times than eutectic Pb/Sn 37:63 solder. Additionally wetting force is typically lower, which can be disadvantageous (for hole filling), but advantageous in other situations (closely spaced components).

Care must be taken in selection of RoHS solders as some formulations are harder with less ductility, increasing the likelihood of cracks instead of plastic deformation, which is typical for lead-containing solders. Cracks can occur due to thermal or mechanical forces acting on components or the circuit board, the former being more common during manufacturing and the latter in the field. RoHS solders exhibit advantages and disadvantages in these respects, dependent on packaging and formulation.

The editor of Conformity Magazine wondered in 2005 if the transition to lead-free solder would affect long-term reliability of electronic devices and systems, especially in applications more mission-critical than in consumer products, citing possible breaches due to other environmental factors like oxidation. The 2005 Farnell/Newark InOne &quot;RoHS Legislation and Technical Manual&quot;, cites these and other &quot;lead-free&quot; solder issues, such as:

# Warping or delamination of printed circuit boards;
# Damage to through-holes, ICs and components on circuit boards; and,
# Added moisture sensitivity, all of which may compromise quality and reliability.

=== Effect on reliability ===
Potential reliability concerns were addressed in Annex item #7 of the RoHS directive, granting some specific exemptions from regulation until 2010. These issues were raised when the directive was first implemented in 2003 and reliability effects were less known.

Another potential problem that some lead-free, high tin-based solders may face is the growth of tin whiskers. These thin strands of tin can grow and make contact with an adjacent trace, developing a short circuit. Lead in the solder suppresses the growth of tin whiskers. Historically tin whiskers have been associated with a handful of failures, including a nuclear power plant shutdown and pacemaker incident where pure tin plating was used. However, these failures pre-date RoHS. They also do not involve consumer electronics, and therefore may employ RoHS-restricted substances if desired. Manufacturers of electronic equipment for mission-critical aerospace applications have followed a policy of caution and therefore resisted the adoption of lead-free solders.

To help mitigate potential problems, lead-free manufacturers are using a variety of approaches such as tin-zinc formulations that produce non-conducting whiskers or formulations that reduce growth, although they do not halt growth completely in all circumstances. Fortunately, experience thus far suggests deployed instances of RoHS compliant products are not failing due to whisker growth. Dr. Ronald Lasky of Dartmouth College reports: &quot;RoHS has been in force for more than 15 months now, and ~$400B RoHS-compliant products have been produced. With all of these products in the field, no significant numbers of tin whisker-related failures have been reported.&quot; Whisker growth occurs slowly over time, is unpredictable, and not fully understood, so time may be the only true test of these efforts. Whisker growth is even observable for lead-based solders, albeit on a much smaller scale.

Some countries have exempted medical and telecommunication infrastructure products from the legislation. However, this may be a moot point, since as electronic component manufacturers convert their production lines to producing only lead-free parts, conventional parts with eutectic tin-lead solder will simply not be available, even for military, aerospace and industrial users. To the extent that only solder is involved, this is at least partially mitigated by many lead-free components&#x27; compatibility with lead-containing solder processes. Leadframe-based components, such as Quad Flat Packages (QFP), Small Outline Integrated Circuits (SOIC), and Small outline packages (SOP) with gull wing leads, are generally compatible since the finish on the part leads contributes a small amount of material to the finished joint. However, components such as Ball grid arrays (BGA) which come with lead-free solder balls and leadless parts are often not compatible with lead-containing processes.

=== Economic effect ===
There are no &quot;de minimis&quot; exemptions, e.g., for micro-businesses. This economic effect was anticipated and at least some attempts at mitigating the effect were made.

Another form of economic effect is the cost of product failures during the switch to RoHS compliance. For example, tin whiskers were responsible for a 5% failure rate in certain components of Swiss Swatch watches in 2006, prior to the July implementation of RoHS, reportedly triggering a US$1 billion recall. Swatch responded to this by applying for an exemption to RoHS compliance, but this was denied.

== Benefits ==
===Health benefits===
RoHS helps reduce damage to people and the environment in third-world countries where much of today&#x27;s &quot;high-tech waste&quot; ends up.
The use of lead-free solders and components reduces risks to electronics industry workers in prototype and manufacturing operations. Contact with solder paste no longer represents the same health hazard as it used to.

===Reliability concerns unfounded===
Contrary to the predictions of widespread component failure and reduced reliability, RoHS&#x27;s first anniversary (July 2007) passed with little fanfare. Most contemporary consumer electronics are RoHS compliant. As of 2013, millions of compliant products are in use worldwide.

Many electronics companies keep &quot;RoHS status&quot; pages on their corporate websites. For example, the AMD website states:

Although lead containing solder cannot be completely eliminated from all applications today, AMD engineers have developed effective technical solutions to reduce lead content in microprocessors and chipsets to ensure RoHS compliance while minimizing costs and maintaining product features. There is no change to fit, functional, electrical or performance specifications. Quality and reliability standards for RoHS compliant products are expected to be identical compared to current packages.

RoHS printed circuit board finishing technologies are surpassing traditional formulations in fabrication thermal shock, solder paste printability, contact resistance, and aluminium wire bonding performance and nearing their performance in other attributes.

The properties of lead-free solder, such as its high temperature resilience, has been used to prevent failures under harsh field conditions. These conditions include operating temperatures with test cycles in the range of −40 °C to +150 °C with severe vibration and shock requirements. Automobile manufacturers are turning to RoHS solutions now as electronics move into the engine bay.

===Flow properties and assembly===
One of the major differences between lead-containing and lead-free solder pastes is the &quot;flow&quot; of the solder in its liquid state. Lead-containing solder has a lower surface tension, and tends to move slightly to attach itself to exposed metal surfaces that touch any part of the liquid solder. Lead-free solder conversely tends to stay in place where it is in its liquid state, and attaches itself to exposed metal surfaces only where the liquid solder touches it.

This lack of &quot;flow&quot; – while typically seen as a disadvantage because it can lead to lower quality electrical connections – can be used to place components more tightly than they used to be placed due to the properties of lead-containing solders.

For example, Motorola reports that their new RoHS wireless device assembly techniques are &quot;...enabling a smaller, thinner, lighter unit.&quot; Their Motorola Q phone would not have been possible without the new solder. The lead-free solder allows for tighter pad spacing.

===Some exempt products achieve compliance===
Research into new alloys and technologies is allowing companies to release RoHS products that are currently exempt from compliance, &quot;e.g.&quot; computer servers. IBM has announced a RoHS solution for high lead solder joints once thought to remain a permanent exemption. The lead-free packaging technology &quot;...offers economical advantages in relation to traditional bumping processes, such as solder waste reduction, use of bulk alloys, quicker time-to-market for products and a much lower chemical usage rate.&quot;

Test and measurement vendors, such as National Instruments, have also started to produce RoHS-compliant products, despite devices in this category being exempt from the RoHS directive.

==Practical==

RoHS compliance can be misleading because RoHS3 (EU) allows exemptions, ex. up to 85% lead content for high-temperature soldering alloys.

Therefore good companies should clearly define their level of compliance in their product main datasheets (DS); ideally, they should provide a product content sheet (PCS) with full substance declaration by mass. Similarly, good developers (and users) should carefully validate the product info to make sure they get the exact material safety expected.

Industry Examples:

* RoHS3 compliant without exemptions
* RoHS3 compliant with all applicable exemptions
* RoHS3 compliant with exemption 7a
* RoHS3 compliant, lead-free
* RoHS3 compliant, green (where the term green is a company-specific standard, ex. lead-free and halogen-free)
* RoHS3 compliant with exemptions, lead-free finish

Ideal: RoHS3 compliant without exemptions

Good Minimum Standard: RoHS3 compliant with exemption for lead-content on internal-only material (to help prevent lead-exposure on touch, lead-leakage in water)

<doc id="558218" wikidata="Q6961757" url="?curid=558218" title="Jacob Zeilin">
<text>Jacob Zeilin (July 16, 1806 – November 18, 1880) was the United States Marine Corps&#x27; first non-brevet flag officer. He served as the seventh commandant of the United States Marine Corps, from 1864 to 1876.

==Early life and education==
Zeilin was born in Philadelphia on July 16, 1806. He attended the United States Military Academy from 1822 to 1825, but dropped out due to poor grades in philosophy and chemistry.

==Career==
Zeilin was commissioned in the Marine Corps as a second lieutenant on October 1, 1831. After completing the preliminary training of a Marine officer in Washington, D.C., Zeilin&#x27;s first tours of duty were ashore at the Marine Barracks, Philadelphia, and at Gosport, Virginia. He first went to sea on board the sloop of war in March 1832, which was followed by a tour of duty at Charlestown (Boston), Massachusetts. In August 1834, he again joined the sloop &quot;Erie&quot; on a long and eventful voyage which lasted for more than three years. He was promoted to first lieutenant on 12 September 1836.

From September 1837 to April 1841, Zeilin again served at Charlestown, Massachusetts, and New York. In February 1842, he returned to sea duty, on board the , and during the cruise that followed spent several months on the Brazil station. Upon the conclusion of this tour of sea duty, and after again serving at important Marine Corps stations on the east coast of the United States from 1842 to 1845, he was transferred to duty aboard the frigate of the U.S. Pacific Squadron.

===Mexican–American War===
During the Mexican–American War, Zeilin commanded the Marine Detachment embarked in &quot;Congress&quot;, which ship was attached to Commodore Robert F. Stockton&#x27;s force. He took part in the conquest of California (1846–1847) and was brevetted to the rank of major (two grades above his rank at the time) for gallantry during the action at the San Gabriel River crossing on January 9, 1847. Later, he took part in the capture of Los Angeles and in the Battle of La Mesa.

On 28 January 1847, Zeilin was appointed Military Commandant of San Diego and served in that capacity until the completion of the conquest of California. He was promoted to the regular rank of captain on 14 September 1847. During the following few months, Zeilin, with the Marines of the Pacific Squadron, participated in the capture of important ports in lower California and the west coast of Mexico, and served as Fleet Marine Officer of the Pacific Squadron. In September 1847, he served with the forces that captured Guaymas and those that met the enemy at San Jose on the 30th. For the remainder of the war, Mazatlán was his center of activity, and he fought in several skirmishes with the Mexicans in that area.

===Interwar period===
After the close of the war with Mexico, Zeilin proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, where he served for a time, then to New York. He remained at New York until June 1852. He was selected to accompany Commodore Matthew C. Perry as Fleet Marine Officer in the famous expedition to Japan, serving with the Marine Detachment in in which he cruised to Japan with the expedition. With elaborate ceremonies, the Marines under his command took a prominent part in the expedition. He was the second person to set foot on shore at the formal landing of the naval forces at Kurihama, Yokosuka, Japan on 14 July 1853, and was one of those later accorded special honor for his part in the expedition that opened the doors of Japan to the outside world.

Upon his return from Japan, he was again stationed at Norfolk. This duty was followed by his being placed in command of the Marine Barracks of the Washington Navy Yard. After remaining for a time at Washington, he again went to sea, this time aboard the frigate , on the European Station, until 1859.

===American Civil War===
During the early part of the American Civil War, Zeilin was on garrison duty in command of Marine Barracks, firstly at Philadelphia and later at Washington, D.C. Five days later, he was appointed to the regular rank of major. On July 21, 1861, he commanded a company of U.S. Marines during the First Battle of Bull Run and received a slight wound.

In 1863, Zeilin was given command of the battalion of U.S. Marines sent to support the naval force whose mission was the capture of Charleston, South Carolina, but, because of illness, he returned after a few weeks of this duty to garrison duty at Marine Barracks, Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Later, he returned to sea, serving with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral John Dahlgren. In 1864, Zeilin assumed command of the Marine Barracks at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

===Commandant of the Marine Corps===
On June 10, 1864, he was appointed Colonel Commandant of the Marine Corps in the rank of colonel. His faithful and efficient performance of the duties of Commandant of the Marine Corps during the trying period of the last year of the war and those years immediately following the close of the war is evidenced by the fact that he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on 2 March 1867. Upon his promotion, he became the Marine Corps&#x27; first general officer.

After the war, Brigadier General Zeilin successfully defended the Marine Corps against its critics. In 1868, Zeilin approved of the design of the &quot;Eagle, Globe, and Anchor,&quot; as the emblem for the Marine Corps. It replaced the previous emblem which was a bugle with a letter &quot;M&quot; in the middle.

Zeilin retired from the Marine Corps on November 1, 1876, after serving over forty-five years as a Marine Corps officer. When considering his time at West Point, he served over 49 years in uniform.

==Personal life==

Zeilin married Virginia Freeman on October 22, 1845. Together they had one son, William Freeman Zeilin (1851-1880) and two daughters, Margaret Freeman Very (1850-1911) (wife of Edward Wilson Very) and Anne V. Stockton (wife of one of Senator John P. Stockton&#x27;s sons).

General Zeilin was a member of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society of officers who served in the Union armed forces.

On 18 November 1880, he died in Washington, D.C. He is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==
*Two ships in the United States Navy have been named USS &quot;Zeilin&quot; in his honor: in 1920 and in 1941.
*He is the namesake for Zeilin Road, on Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia.
*He is the namesake for Zeilin Street, on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in California.

<doc id="558219" wikidata="Q650483" url="?curid=558219" title="Sports journalism">
<text>Sports journalism is a form of writing that reports on matters pertaining to sporting topics and competitions. Sports journalism has its roots in coverage of horse racing and boxing in the early 1800s, mainly targeted towards elites, and into the 1900s transitioned into an integral part of the news business with newspapers having dedicated sports sections. The increased popularity of sports amongst the middle and lower class led to the more coverage of sports content in publications. The appetite for sports resulted in sports-only media such as &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and ESPN. There are many different forms of sports journalism, ranging from play-by-play and game recaps to analysis and investigative journalism on important developments in the sport. Technology and the internet age has massively changed the sports journalism space as it is struggling with the same problems that the broader category of print journalism is struggling with, mainly not being able to cover costs due to falling subscriptions. New forms of internet blogging and tweeting in the current millennium have pushed the boundaries of sports journalism.

== Early history ==
Modern sports journalism found its roots as content started to appear in newspapers in the early 1800s. At the start, the sports sporadically covered were horse racing and boxing. The focus of the coverage would be less on the event itself and more on the greater social context. Horse races between the North and South and boxing bouts between US and England garnered much interest from the social elite. In the early nineteenth century, popular British sportswriter Pierce Egan coined the term &quot;the Sweet Science&quot; as an epithet for prizefighting — or more fully &quot;the Sweet Science of Bruising&quot; as a description of England&#x27;s bare-knuckle fight scene. During the 1820s and 1830s, the primary demographic target for newspapers was the social elite as newspaper was too expensive for the common man. Approaching the 20th century, several important changes occurred that lead to the increased saturation of sports journalism in the mainstream. The first was the advent of the penny press which allowed for cheaper and more tabloid style of newspaper production. Newspapers also began using advertising to pay for their production costs instead of relying on circulation.

== 20th century ==
The 1920s has been called the &quot;Golden Age of American Sports&quot;. Baseball became the national pastime, college football became popular, and radio and newspaper coverage increased. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; was the first newspapers to publishing consistent sports coverage. The &quot;New York World&quot; in 1883 was the first newspaper to have a full times sports department. The following period from 1880 to 1920 saw a massive increase in sports coverage in publications. A study showed that in 1880 only 0.4 percent of space in the newspaper was dedicated to sports. By the 1920s, that proportion had risen to 20 percent. During this time, newspapers focused mainly on play by play coverage and game recaps of the sport events. Local publications started hiring beat reporters who were tasked with following all developments pertaining to the team. This included traveling with the team and interviewing the players. Teams also started constructing dedicated sections called press box in the stadiums for the press to sit and record notes on the game.

As technology introduced new developments like the radio, television and the internet, the focus of sports coverage shifted from the play by play to statistical analysis of the game and background pieces on the players. This was also coupled with a massive increase in sports amongst the general public. The increased popularity of football, basketball and hockey meant more content to publish and more interested readers to publish to. This led to the creation of journals like &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, first published in 1954, was one of the first publications to solely focus on sports. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; was the brainchild of Henry Lucre who felt that the established publishers at the time were not taking advantage of the public&#x27;s massive appetite for sports. With weekly issues, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; was able to produce more classic journalistic pieces as the writers had more time to research and conduct longer interview sit downs with players and coaches.

== Digital age ==
Since the start of the new millennium, circulation and advertising numbers of print newspapers having been falling rapidly. This has led to widespread cost cutting and layoffs across the industry. There are 29 percent fewer journalists in the workforce now when compared to the number of journalist in 1980. These developments have significantly affected sports journalism as established publications like &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and ESPN have had to cut content, increase prices and reduce the number of publications which leads to more people unsubscribing from the content. The fall in print sports journalism can be tied to the rise of internet and digital sports journalism. Digital sports journalism serves as both a complement and a competitor of newspaper sports journalism. Digital sports journalism began in the mid 1990s with ESPN creating the first website in 1995. At first digital sports journalism covered broad topics in scope, but as time went on and the internet became more widespread, bloggers and location and team specific websites started taking over the market. A majority of these smaller websites did not charge a subscription fee as it was funded on advertising. This lower cost to the consumer as well as increased access to variety of very specific content led to the shift away from print and towards digital. However, the growth seen in the digital space which has increased advertising revenue has not balanced out the losses from print journalism. The importance of click count has gone up as these sites are being funded by online advertisers. This has led to many shorter journalistic pieces offering controversial opinions in order to generate the most clicks. Sportswriters regularly face more deadline pressure than other reporters because sporting events tend to occur late in the day and closer to the deadlines many organizations must observe. Yet they are expected to use the same tools as news journalists, and to uphold the same professional and ethical standards. They must take care not to show bias for any team. Twitter and other social media platforms became sports information providers. Twitter became a platform for sports in 2009 during the NBA playoffs. By the end of April, tweeting by television sports analysts, announcers, and journalists was the new trend in sports.

== Socio-political significance ==

Sports stories occasionally transcend the games themselves and take on socio-political significance: Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier in baseball is an example of this. Modern controversies regarding the hyper-compensation of top athletes, the use of anabolic steroids and other, banned performance-enhancing drugs, and the cost to local and national governments to build sports venues and related infrastructure, especially for Olympic Games, also demonstrates how sports can intrude on to the news pages.
Recently, the issue of Colin Kaepernick&#x27;s protest of injustice shown to people of color by the police by kneeling during the performance of the national anthem before his football games has created diverse and varied coverage. His actions have taken his discussion from the sports field and into the national scope as major political pundits and even the Presidents commenting on the ethics of his actions. Kaepernick cites that his position as a quarterback in the National Football League gives him a unique opportunity to carry out his message. Kaepernick&#x27;s actions have inspired a wave of athletes using their position to take on social issues ranging from abortion to college athletes getting monetary compensation. Sports journalism plays a significant role in how these views are conveyed to the public. The author creates a story from the raw quotes provided by the athlete and this is published to thousands of viewers. Inherent in the publication will be the biases of the author and this will be passed on to the reader (cite). As sports moves more and more into the political discussion space, sports journalist will have increasingly more power over the public sentiment of the hottest issues at the moment.

== Future of sports journalism ==
There has been a major shift within sports in the last decade as more sports teams are switching to using analytics. A large reason for this shift is due to many articles being published about the increased benefit of using analytics to make strategic decisions in a game. As there is data collected about every instance in every sport, sports data analysis has increased. Sports publications are now hiring people with extensive background in statistics and mathematics in order to publish articles detailing the analysis these teams are conducting. New metrics have been created to study the quality of player performance. The metrics have also been used to compile rankings of players and teams. Blog sites like FiveThirtyEight began to sprout as full-time sport analytic sites that took available data and constructed analytic heavy articles pertaining to sports. ESPN has implemented a segment in their shows called ‘Sports Science’ where stars of every sport come in to test how advanced analytics affect field performance. There has been much pushback by many over the use of analytics in sports. Many established coaches are quick to bash analytics as narrow and ignorant of the big picture.

== In Europe ==
The tradition of sports reporting attracting some of the finest writers in journalism can be traced to the coverage of sport in Victorian England, where several modern sports – such as association football, cricket, athletics and rugby – were first organized and codified into something resembling what we would recognize today.

Andrew Warwick has suggested that The Boat Race provided the first mass spectator event for journalistic coverage. The Race, an annual rowing event between the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford, has been held annually from 1856.

Cricket, possibly because of its esteemed place in society, has regularly attracted the most elegant of writers. The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, in the first half of the 20th century, employed Neville Cardus as its cricket correspondent as well as its music critic. Cardus was later knighted for his services to journalism. One of his successors, John Arlott, who became a worldwide favorite because of his radio commentaries on the BBC, was also known for his poetry.

The first London Olympic Games in 1908 attracted such widespread public interest that many newspapers assigned their very best-known writers to the event. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; even had Sir Arthur Conan Doyle at the White City Stadium to cover the finish of the Marathon.

Such was the drama of that race, in which Dorando Pietri collapsed within sight of the finishing line when leading, that Conan Doyle led a public subscription campaign to see the gallant Italian, having been denied the gold medal through his disqualification, awarded a special silver cup, which was presented by Queen Alexandra. And the public imagination was so well caught by the event that annual races in Boston, Massachusetts, and London, and at future Olympics, were henceforward staged over exactly the same, 26-mile, 385-yard distance used for the 1908 Olympic Marathon, and the official length of the event worldwide to this day.

The London race, called the Polytechnic Marathon and originally staged over the 1908 Olympic route from outside the royal residence at Windsor Castle to White City, was first sponsored by the &quot;Sporting Life&quot;, which in those Edwardian times was a daily newspaper which sought to cover all sporting events, rather than just a betting paper for horse racing and greyhounds that it became in the years after the Second World War.

The rise of the radio made sports journalism more focused on the live coverage of the sporting events. The first sports reporter in Great Britain, and one of the first sports reporters in the World, was an English writer Edgar Wallace, who made a report on The Derby on June 6, 1923 for the British Broadcasting Company.

In France, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, the predecessor of &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot;, had already played an equally influential part in the sporting fabric of society when it announced in 1903 that it would stage an annual bicycle race around the country. The Tour de France was born, and sports journalism&#x27;s role in its foundation is still reflected today in the leading rider wearing a yellow jersey - the color of the paper on which &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; was published (in Italy, the Giro d&#x27;Italia established a similar tradition, with the leading rider wearing a jersey the same pink color as the sponsoring newspaper, &quot;La Gazzetta&quot;).

== Sports stars in the press box ==
After the Second World War, the sports sections of British national daily and Sunday newspapers continued to expand, to the point where many papers now have separate standalone sports sections; some Sunday tabloids even have sections, additional to the sports pages, devoted solely to the previous day&#x27;s football reports. In some respects, this has replaced the earlier practice of many regional newspapers which - until overtaken by the pace of modern electronic media - would produce special results editions rushed out on Saturday evenings.

Some newspapers, such as &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, with 1924 Olympic 100 meters champion Harold Abrahams, or the London &quot;Evening News&quot; using former England cricket captain Sir Leonard Hutton, began to adopt the policy of hiring former sports stars to pen columns, which were often ghost written. Some such ghosted columns, however, did little to further the reputation of sports journalism, which is increasingly becoming the subject of academic scrutiny of its standards.

Many &quot;ghosted&quot; columns were often run by independent sports agencies, based in Fleet Street or in the provinces, who had signed up the sports star to a contract and then syndicated their material among various titles. These agencies included Pardons, or the Cricket Reporting Agency, which routinely provided the editors of the Wisden cricket almanac, and Hayters.

Sportswriting in Britain has attracted some of the finest journalistic talents. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;&#x27;s Peter Wilson, Hugh McIlvanney, first at &quot;The Observer&quot; and lately at the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, Ian Wooldridge of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and soccer writer Brian Glanville, best known at the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, and columnist Patrick Collins, of the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, five times the winner of the Sports Writer of the Year Award.

Many became household names in the late 20th century through their trenchant reporting of events, spurring popularity: the Massacre at the Munich Olympics in 1972; Muhammad Ali&#x27;s fight career, including his 1974 title bout against George Foreman; the Heysel Stadium disaster; and the career highs and lows of the likes of Tiger Woods, George Best, David Beckham, Lester Piggott and other high-profile stars.

McIlvanney and Wooldridge, who died in March 2007, aged 75, both enjoyed careers that saw them frequently work in television. During his career, Wooldridge became so famous that, like the sports stars he reported upon, he hired the services of IMG, the agency founded by the American businessman, Mark McCormack, to manage his affairs. Glanville wrote several books, including novels, as well as scripting the memorable official film to the 1966 World Cup staged in England.

== Investigative journalism and sport ==
Since the 1990s, the growing importance of sport, its impact as a global business and the huge amounts of money involved in the staging of events such as the Olympic Games and football World Cups, has also attracted the attention of investigative journalists. The sensitive nature of the relationships between sports journalists and the subjects of their reporting, as well as declining budgets experienced by most Fleet Street newspapers, has meant that such long-term projects have often emanated from television documentary makers.

Tom Bower, with his 2003 sports book of the year &quot;Broken Dreams&quot;, which analyzed British football, followed in the tradition established a decade earlier by Andrew Jennings and Vyv Simson with their controversial investigation of corruption within the International Olympic Committee. Jennings and Simson&#x27;s &quot;The Lords of the Rings&quot; in many ways predicted the scandals that were to emerge around the staging of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City; Jennings would follow-up with two further books on the Olympics and one on FIFA, the world football body.

Likewise, award-winning writers Duncan Mackay, of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and Steven Downes unravelled many scandals involving doping, fixed races and bribery in international athletics in their 1996 book, &quot;Running Scared&quot;, which offered an account of the threats by a senior track official that led to the suicide of their sports journalist colleague, Cliff Temple.

But the writing of such exposes - referred to as &quot;spitting in the soup&quot; by Paul Kimmage, the former Tour de France professional cyclist, now an award-winning writer for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; – often requires the view of an outsider who is not compromised by the need of day-to-day dealings with sportsmen and officials, as required by &quot;beat&quot; correspondents.
The stakes can be high when upsetting sport&#x27;s powers: in 2007, England&#x27;s FA opted to switch its multimillion-pound contract for UK coverage rights of the FA Cup and England international matches from the BBC to rival broadcasters ITV. One of the reasons cited was that the BBC had been too critical of the performances of the England football team.

==Sports books==

Increasingly, sports journalists have turned to long-form writing, producing popular books on a range of sporting topics, including biographies, history and investigations. Dan Topolski was the first recipient of the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award in 1989, which has continued to reward authors for their excellence in sports literature.

== Organizations ==
Most countries have their own national association of sports journalists. Many sports also have their own clubs and associations for specified journalists. These organizations attempt to maintain the standard of press provision at sports venues, to oversee fair accreditation procedures and to celebrate high standards of sports journalism.

The International Sports Press Association, AIPS, was founded in 1924 during the Olympic Games in Paris, at the headquarters of the Sporting Club de France, by Frantz Reichel, the press chief of the Paris Games, and the Belgian Victor Boin. AIPS operates through a system of continental sub-associations and national associations, and liaises closely with some of the world&#x27;s biggest sports federations, including the International Olympic Committee, football&#x27;s world governing body FIFA, and the IAAF, the international track and field body. The first statutes of AIPS mentioned these objectives:

* to enhance the cooperation between its member associations in defending sport and the professional interest of their members.
* to strengthen the friendship, solidarity and common interests between sports journalists of all countries.
* to assure the best possible working conditions for the members.

For horse racing the Horserace Writers and Photographers’ Association was founded in 1927, was revived in 1967, and represents the interests of racing journalists in every branch of the media.

In Britain, the Sports Journalists&#x27; Association was founded in 1948. It stages two awards events, an annual Sports Awards ceremony which recognizes outstanding performances by British sportsmen and women during the previous year, and the British Sports Journalism Awards, the industry&#x27;s &quot;Oscars&quot;, sponsored by UK Sport and presented each March. Founded as the Sports Writers&#x27; Association, following a merger with the Professional Sports Photographers&#x27; Association in 2002, the organization changed its title to the more inclusive SJA. The SJA represents the British sports media on the British Olympic Association&#x27;s press advisory committee and acts as a consultant to organizers of major events who need guidance on media requirements as well as seeking to represent its members&#x27; interests in a range of activities. In March 2008, Martin Samuel, then the chief football correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot;, was named British Sportswriter of the Year, the first time any journalist had won the award three years in succession. At the same awards, Jeff Stelling, of Sky Sports, was named Sports Broadcaster of the Year for the third time, a prize determined by a ballot of SJA members. Stelling won the vote again the following year, when the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;&#x27;s Paul Kimmage won the interviewer of the year prize for a fifth time.

In the United States, the Indianapolis-based National Sports Journalism Center monitors trends and strategy within the sports media industry. The center is also home to the Associated Press Sports Editors.

In more recent years, sports journalism has turned its attention to online news and press release media and provided services to Associated Press and other major news syndication services.

== Fanzines and blogs ==
Through the 1970s and 1980s, a rise in &quot;citizen journalism&quot; in Europe was witnessed in the rapid growth in popularity of soccer &quot;fanzines&quot; - cheaply printed magazines written by fans for fans that bypassed often stilted official club match programs and traditional media. Many continue today and thrive.

Some authors, such as Jim Munro, have been adopted by their clubs. Once an editor of the West Ham United fanzine &quot;Fortune&#x27;s Always Dreaming&quot;, Munro was hired by the club to write for its matchday magazine and is now sports editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; Online. Other titles, such as the irreverent monthly soccer magazine &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot;, have effectively gone mainstream.

The advent of the Internet has seen much of this fan-generated energy directed into sports blogs. Ranging from team-centric blogs to those that cover the sports media itself, Bleacher Report, Deadspin.com, ProFootballTalk.com, BaseballEssential.com, Tireball Sports, AOL Fanhouse, Masshole Sports, the blogs in the Yardbarker Network, and others have garnered massive followings.

There are now platforms that act as &#x27;Blog hosts&#x27;, which allow both amateur and professional sports writers to host their content without the need for a custom website.
These include Medium, and Muckrack, which are free platforms to use, which in turn do not pay the contributors. This can lead to a lack of quality as there is no editorial element, however their reach is large.

There are also editorially managed sites that do pay their contributors in a similar fashion to traditional publishers. I.e. a price per word or per article. Examples of these are Athlon Sports and The Sporting Blog.

Other sports blogs such as Fansided and SB Nation suggest a combination of traffic and results based incentives with regards to recompense for contributions.

More recently, investment vehicles like Rocket Sports Internet have emerged that provide capital for sports journalists and news creators to run their own businesses and leverage the increasing number of ways that creators can more easily generate revenue streams outside of the conventional organisational structures. Early successes include BenchWarmers, Empire of the Kop and caughtoffside.

==Smartphones==

The rise of smartphones have recently taken off and altered the way sports media has been presented. Smartphones have had a big influence on how the public perceives sports entertainment and content. Sports media is often accessible on various applications on the smartphone. These apps include ESPN, Bleacher Report, Global Sports Media, House of Highlights, and YouTube. The rise of mobile streaming has led to approximately 65% of sports followers streaming sports on a mobile device. Smartphones also allow for 24 hour access to sports news via social media apps such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. They are a very fast and convenient way to access sports news on the go no matter where you are. The applications on smartphones that contain information about sports news and events are generally free. Fans ability to access sports on their smartphones allows them to personally engage (i.e. fantasy sports) and/or absorb sports information. Smartphones have truly increased the spread of sports news, typically in the form of videos, highlights, scores, and articles. Applications on smartphones, especially Twitter and ESPN, tend to be the platforms where sports breaking news first emerge. Overall, smartphones provide readily available sports news that can be accessed during the course of a sports fan&#x27;s everyday life.

==Female reporting==

Women have not always been in the sports reporting field. Women such as Jane Chastain and Lesley Visser are considered pioneers in women&#x27;s sportscasting. Chastain was the first woman to work for a large network (CBS) and the first woman to do play-by-play in the &#x27;60s.

Lesley Visser was a sportswriter for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; before she joined CBS in 1984 as a part-time reporter. She is the only sportscaster in history, male or female, to have worked on the Final Four, NBA Finals, World Series, Monday Night Football, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, and the US Open broadcasts. She has been voted the No. 1 Female Sportscaster of all time.

There has been an ongoing debate as to whether or not female reporters should be allowed in the locker rooms after games. If they are denied access, this gives male reporters a competitive advantage in the field, as they can interview players in the locker room after games. If locker room access is denied to all reporters - male and female - because of this controversy, male journalists would likely resent female reporters for having their access taken away.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1978 that female sports journalists were allowed to enter locker rooms for interviews. Sports Illustrated reporter, Melissa Ludtke, sued the New York Yankees for not allowing her to interview players in the locker room during the 1977 World Series. A federal judge ruled that this ban was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment.

Some female reporters include Adeline Daley (whom some consider the &quot;Jackie Robinson of female sportswriters&quot;), Anita Martini, Mary Garber, Lesley Visser, Marjorie Herrera Lewis, Sally Jenkins, and Holly Rowe.

<text>Simon Hugh Holmes (July 30, 1831 – October 14, 1919) was a Nova Scotia politician, publisher and lawyer. He was the fourth premier of Nova Scotia from 1878 to 1882.

Holmes was born in Springville, Nova Scotia, in Pictou County. The son of Nova Scotia politician and Canadian senator John Holmes, Holmes in 1858 founded and edited the Pictou &quot;Colonial Standard&quot; as “a dedicated advocate of the principles of true Conservatism.” The paper and Holmes were advocates of Canadian confederation. Holmes remained editor until 1878 when he became Premier.

Holmes attempted to win a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1867 but was defeated in a wave of anti-Confederation sentiment. He won a seat in 1871 and soon became &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Conservative opposition. The Tories won the 1878 election and Holmes became Premier of the province to find the treasury depleted and the Legislative Council in the hands of the Liberals.

The Tory government passed legislation to create county government, lengthened the training period for teachers, subsidized education for blind children and attempted to improve mine safety.

The Liberal-dominated Upper House frustrated much of Holmes&#x27; program and he attempted three times to abolish the Legislative Council, but failed.

Holmes&#x27; personal style tended to be authoritarian and this factor, along with the political impasse, led to a caucus revolt that resulted in his resignation in 1882 to accept a lucrative position as crown clerk for Halifax County. He died in Halifax.

<text>Friedrich Albert von Zenker (13 March 1825 – 13 June 1898) was a German pathologist and physician, celebrated for his discovery of trichinosis.

He was born in Dresden, and was educated in Leipzig and Heidelberg. While in Leipzig, he worked for a while as an assistant to Justus Radius at the St. Georg Hospital. Attached to the city hospital of Dresden in 1851, he added, in 1855, the duties of professor of pathological anatomy and general pathology in the surgico-medical academy of that city. In 1862 he became professor of pathological anatomy and pharmacology at Erlangen. Three years afterwards he assumed with Hugo Wilhelm von Ziemssen the editorship of the &quot;&quot;Deutsches Archiv für klinische Medizin&quot;. In 1895 he retired from active service.

Zenker&#x27;s diverticulum, a false pathological diverticulum of the posterior pharyngeal wall, through the thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus parts of the inferior constrictor muscle, is named after him.

His important discovery of the danger of trichina dates from 1860. In that year he published &quot;Ueber die Trichinenkrankheit des Menschen&quot;&quot; (in volume xviii of &quot;Virchows&quot;&quot;Archiv&quot;&quot;)&quot;.

In 1865 he was awarded the Monthyon Prize by the French Academy of Sciences.

<doc id="558247" wikidata="Q1066394" url="?curid=558247" title="Vanishing Point (Primal Scream album)">
<text>Vanishing Point is the fifth studio album by Scottish rock band Primal Scream. It was released on 7 July 1997 in the United Kingdom by Creation Records and in the United States by Reprise Records. It peaked at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart. The album shows inspiration from genres such as dub, ambient, dance music, and krautrock, as well as bands such as Motörhead, Can, and the Stooges. It was the band&#x27;s first album to feature Gary &#x27;Mani&#x27; Mounfield on bass, formerly of the Stone Roses, although Marco Nelson played bass on &quot;Burning Wheel&quot;, &quot;Star&quot;, &quot;If They Move, Kill &#x27;Em&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Stuka&quot;. Other guest appearances on &quot;Vanishing Point&quot; include Augustus Pablo, Glen Matlock, and the Memphis Horns.

==Background==
Gillespie has described the album as an anarcho-syndicalist speedfreak road-movie record. It is named after and inspired by the 1971 film &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, especially the song &quot;Kowalski&quot;, which is meant to be an alternative soundtrack of the movie. Lead singer Bobby Gillespie said, &quot;The music in the film is hippy music, so we thought, &#x27;Why not record some music that really reflects the mood of the film?&#x27; It&#x27;s always been a favourite of the band, we love the air of paranoia and speed- freak righteousness. It&#x27;s impossible to get hold of now, which is great! It&#x27;s a pure underground film, rammed with claustrophobia.&quot;

==Recording==
The album was written and recorded with the aid of two portable eight-track recording studios at the band&#x27;s Chalk Farm rehearsal rooms. The entire album was written and recorded in two months and mixed an additional month. On their cover of &quot;Motorhead&quot;, Gillespie sung the first verse through a Darth Vader mask. According to an article, much of the album came from live improvisation and, &quot;Then later on we&#x27;d layer other sounds and loops over the top, and the vocals,&quot; Gillespie said in an interview. The track &quot;If They Move, Kill &#x27;Em&quot; was originally to have included a sample from Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s film &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; (the song title is one of the earliest lines of dialogue spoken in the film), but it could not be cleared in time.

==Release==
&quot;Vanishing Point&quot; was released on 7 July 1997 in the United Kingdom by Creation Records and in the United States by Reprise Records. It is the fifth album by Primal Scream.

Author Irvine Welsh scripted the video for the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Kowalski,&quot; which was directed by musician Douglas Hart. The video features a Dodge Challenger and super model Kate Moss beating up the band. Gillespie described the video as a cross between &quot;Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!&quot; and &quot;The Sweeney&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Vanishing Point&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who welcomed it as a return to form after 1994&#x27;s &quot;Give Out But Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; named it the 4th best album of 1997. In 2012, &quot;NME&quot; journalist Mark Beaumont ranked it as the band&#x27;s fourth best album, calling it &quot;a brilliant record for its statement of intent alone – it stamped in stone Primal Scream&#x27;s mandate to never repeat themselves and consistently indulge their experimental spirit&quot;. The album was also included in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Isabella Clara Eugenia (; 12 August 1566 – 1 December 1633), sometimes referred to as Clara Isabella Eugenia, was sovereign of the Spanish Netherlands, which comprised the Low Countries and the north of modern France with her husband, Archduke Albert VII of Austria. 

Their reign is considered the Golden Age of the Spanish Netherlands, which saw a revival of its economy and arts after a peace was concluded with the break-away Dutch Republic. Isabella was one of the most powerful women in 16th- and 17th-century Europe.

==Early life==
===Childhood===
Isabella Clara Eugenia of Austria was born in the Palace of Valsain, Segovia on 12 August 1566. She was the first surviving daughter of King Philip II of Spain and his third wife, Elisabeth of Valois. 
Her father was reportedly overjoyed at her birth and declared himself to be happier on the occasion than he would have been at the birth of a son. He already had a male heir, Carlos, Prince of Asturias, but due to the Prince’s mental illness and emotional instability, father and son had never developed a close rapport and frequently lived in conflict with one another.

Isabella was baptized by Juan Bautista Castaneo, apostolic nuncio, later Pope Urban VII. Her godfather was her uncle John of Austria. She was named after her mother, the day of her birth, and the devotion to St. Eugenio, whose body her father had transferred the year before from Saint Dionysius of Paris to Toledo with her mother&#x27;s help through her brother, King Charles IX of France.

A year later, Isabella&#x27;s younger sister, Catalina, was born. Their parents were very close to their daughters, buying them jams, dolls, toys, and more. However, their mother miscarried a daughter in 1568 and died the same day.

Isabella and Catherine grew up beloved by their father and stepmother, Anna of Austria, Philip&#x27;s fourth wife. The sisters developed a close relationship. Their father ultimately fathered five children by Anna, all of whom died in early childhood except his heir, Philip.

===Youth===

Isabella and Catherine were raised under the care of Margarita de Cardona, their stepmother&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, and some of their mother&#x27;s own ladies-in-waiting, such as Claude de Vineulx. Both sisters were described as intelligent and well aware of their high social status.

Isabella had a very good education. Her studies presumably included good manners, mathematics, and the languages Dutch, French and Italian besides her native Spanish. Famous artist Sofonisba Anguissola, who served as court painter at the time, influenced the Infanta&#x27;s artistic works. Isabella was the only person whom King Philip permitted to help him with his work, sorting his papers and translating Italian documents into the Spanish language for him.
===Candidate to the French throne===
After her maternal uncle, Henry III of France, was assassinated by the fanatical young monk Jacques Clément on 2 August 1589, Philip II claimed the French crown on Isabella&#x27;s behalf despite France&#x27;s Salic law, which forbade cognatic succession. 

At any rate, her mother had ceded any claim to the French crown with her marriage to the Spanish king. However, the &quot;Parlement of Paris&quot;, in power of the Catholic party, gave verdict that Isabella was &quot;the legitimate sovereign&quot; of France. The Huguenot leader, Henry III of Navarre, the actual heir by traditional French inheritance laws, ultimately made his claim to the throne, converted to Catholicism and was crowned in 1594.

===Candidate to the English throne===
Following the 1587 execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, Isabella was suggested as a Catholic candidate in the succession to Elizabeth I as she was a legitimate descendant of John of Gaunt (unlike the Tudors) and her father had been &quot;jure uxoris&quot; King of England.

==Marriage proposals==

As Infanta of Spain and Portugal, Isabella was quite eligible on the political marriage market, though she ended up marrying late for her time.

===Engagement===
At the age of two, Isabella was promised to marry her cousin Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor (18 July 1552 – 20 January 1612), son of her aunt Maria. However, Isabella had to wait for more than 20 years before the eccentric Rudolf declared that he had no intention of marrying anybody. Meanwhile, she served as her father&#x27;s primary caretaker during the last three years of his life, when he was plagued by gout and frequent illness.

===Marriage===
Philip decided to cede the Spanish Netherlands to Isabella on condition that she marry her cousin, Albert VII, Archduke of Austria. He was her former fiancé&#x27;s younger brother, the former viceroy. They were to reign over the Netherlands jointly and be succeeded by their descendants according to the male-preference cognatic primogeniture but should a female succeed, she was required to marry the King of Spain or the person chosen by the King of Spain. It was stipulated that, should they have no children, the Netherlands would revert to the King of Spain upon the death of either spouse.

As Albert was the Archbishop of Toledo, he had to be released from his religious commitments by Pope Clement VIII before the wedding could take place. Shortly before Philip II died on 13 September 1598, he resigned the thrones of the Netherlands in favor of Isabella and her fiancé. The Pope celebrated the union by procuration on 15 November at Ferrera. On 18 April 1599, 33-year-old Isabella married Albert in Valencia. They had three children who died at a very young age, in 1605, 1607, and 1609.
==Habsburg Netherlands==

Beginning in 1601, the Archduke and Archduchess ruled the Spanish Netherlands together. Their reign is a key period in the history of the Spanish Netherlands. After Albert&#x27;s death, Isabella was appointed Governor of the Netherlands on the King of Spain&#x27;s behalf.
 She was succeeded as Governor by Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand of Austria, the third son of her half-brother in 1633.

===Foreign policy===
The first half of Albert and Isabella&#x27;s reign was dominated by war. After overtures to the United Provinces and to Queen Elizabeth I of England proved unsuccessful, the Habsburg policy in the Low Countries aimed at regaining the military initiative and isolating the Dutch Republic. The strategy was to force its opponents to the conference table and negotiate from a position of strength.

In pursuit of that goal and to get their political agenda to all Flemish social classes, Albert and Isabella used the most diverse media. Visual art, in the baroque style popularized in the wake of the Counter-Reformation, was the perfect tool. This, coupled with the political configuration of the period, made the Archduke&#x27;s court at Brussels one of the foremost political and artistic centers in Europe of that time. 

It became the testing ground for the Spanish Monarchy&#x27;s European plans, a boiling pot full of people of all sorts: from artists and diplomats to defectors, spies and penitent traitors, from Spanish confessors, Italian counselors, Burgundian functionaries, English musicians, German bodyguards to the Belgian Nobles. Brussels became a vital link in the chain of Habsburg Courts and the diplomatic conduits between Madrid, Vienna, Paris, London, Lisbon, Graz, Innsbruck, Prague, and The Hague could be said to run through there.

The accession of James VI of Scotland as James I in England had paved the way for a separate peace with England. On 24 July 1604, England, Spain and the Archducal Netherlands signed the Treaty of London. The return to peace was severely hampered by differences over religion. Events such as the Gunpowder Plot caused a lot of diplomatic tension between London and Brussels, but the relations between the two courts tended to be cordial on the whole. Anne of Denmark wore her portrait in a locket as a public token of friendship and kinship.

The threat of diplomatic isolation and General Ambrogio Spínola&#x27;s campaigns induced the Dutch Republic to accept a ceasefire in April 1609. The subsequent negotiations between the warring parties failed to produce a peace treaty, but led to the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce, agreed in Antwerp on 9 April 1609. Under the Truce&#x27;s terms, the United Provinces were to be regarded as a sovereign power for the duration of the truce. After four decades of war, the treaty brought a period of much-needed peace to the Southern Netherlands.

===Economy===

The period of the Truce brought the Habsburg Netherlands a much-needed peace, mainly because the fields could be again worked in safety. The archducal regime encouraged reclamation of land that had been inundated in the course of the hostilities and sponsored the impoldering of De Moeren, a marshy area that is presently astride the Belgian–French border. 

The recovery of agriculture led in turn to a modest increase of the population (and thus workers) after decades of demographic losses. Industry and in particular the luxury trades likewise underwent a recovery, bringing considerable economic stability and prosperity to the Southern Netherlands.

However, international trade was hampered by the closure of the River Scheldt. The archducal regime had plans to bypass the blockade with a system of canals linking Ostend via Bruges to the Scheldt in Ghent and joining the Meuse to the Rhine between Venlo and Rheinberg. To combat urban poverty, the government supported the creation of a network of &quot;Monti di Pietà&quot; based on the Italian model.

===Religion===

The archducal regime ensured the triumph of the Catholic Reformation in the Habsburg Netherlands. Most Protestants had by that stage left the Southern Netherlands. After one last execution in 1597, those that remained were no longer actively persecuted. 

Under the terms of legislation passed in 1609, their presence was tolerated, provided they did not worship in public or engage in religious activities. The resolutions of the Third Provincial Council of Mechlin of 1607 were likewise given official sanction.

Through such measures and by the appointment of a generation of committed bishops, Albert and Isabella laid the foundation of the Catholic confessionalisation of the population. New and reformed religious orders enjoyed the particular support of the rulers. Although the Archduke had certain reservations about the order, the Jesuits received the largest cash grants, allowing them to complete their ambitious building programmes in Brussels and Antwerp. The Capuchins were given considerable sums as well. The foundation of the first convents of Discalced Carmelites in the Southern Netherlands depended wholly on the personal initiative of the archducal couple and bore witness to the Spanish orientation of their spirituality.

===Legislative system===
The reign of Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia saw a strengthening of princely power in the Habsburg Netherlands. The States General of the loyal provinces were only summoned once in 1600. Thereafter, the government preferred to deal directly with the provinces.

The years of the Truce allowed the archducal regime to promulgate legislation on a whole range of matters. The so-called Eternal Edict of 1611, for instance, reformed the judicial system and ushered in the transition from customary to written law. Other measures dealt with monetary matters, the nobility, duels, gambling, etc.

===Relationship with Spain===
The actions of the two rulers stimulated the growth of a separate South Netherlandish identity. However, Albert and Isabella&#x27;s children died at a very young age and as the years passed, it became clear that they would have no more offspring and thus independence wouldn&#x27;t be possible.

After that, Albert and Isabella&#x27;s goal became the reincorporation of the Southern Provinces into the Spanish monarchy. They consolidated the authority of the House of Habsburg over the territory of the Southern Netherlands and largely succeeded in reconciling previous anti-Spanish sentiments. As a result, the States of the loyal provinces swore to accept the Spanish king as heir of the Archduke and Archduchess in a number of ceremonies between May 1616 and January 1617.

===Final years and death===
After Albert&#x27;s death in 1621, Isabella joined the Third Order of St Francis but continued to rule on behalf of her nephew, Philip IV. As Governess, Isabella alternated successes, such as that of the Capture of Breda in 1625, with failures and setbacks, such as the losses of Den Bosch in 1629 and Maastricht in 1632. She died in Brussels in 1633.

==Patronage of arts==
===Court of Brussels===
Isabella and Albert were very supportive of the arts. In their patronage, they selected artists who were able create works that would promote the chief political goals of the Archdukes: to show that their reign was a continuation of the rule of the previous Burgundian and Habsburg rulers as well as to promote the ideals of the revitalized Catholic Church of which they were the staunch defenders. Their favorite artists created new iconography and genres that captured the devoutness and splendor of the archducal court. Their patronage of such artists and architects as Peter Paul Rubens (their court painter since 1609), Wenceslas Cobergher, Jan Brueghel the Elder, Jacob Franquart, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, the De Nole family, Otto van Veen, and stimulated the growth of the artistic movement of Flemish Baroque painting, sculpture and architecture.
However, virtually nothing remains of Albert and Isabella&#x27;s palace on the Coudenberg in Brussels, their summer retreat in Mariemont, or their hunting lodge in Tervuren. Their magnificent collections were scattered after 1633, and considerable parts of them have been lost. Still, the Archdukes enjoy a well-merited reputation as patrons of the arts. By far, the best preserved ensemble of art from the archducal period is to be found at Scherpenheuvel, where Albert and Isabella directed Cobergher, Theodoor van Loon, and the de Noles to create a pilgrimage church in a planned city.

===Descalzas reales===
For a month in 1598 Isabella had lived in the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales in Madrid, alongside her mother-in-law Maria. She continued to take an active interest in the convent, and donated major artworks to it, including a famous series of Brussels tapestries, designed by Rubens. These depict Isabella as the order&#x27;s patron saint, &quot;Clare of Assisi with Monstrance&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*Isabella Clara Eugenia is a minor character in the alternate history 1632 series. She is most notable in the novel &quot;1634: The Bavarian Crisis&quot;.
*In the 2002 alternate history novel &quot;Ruled Britannia&quot; by Harry Turtledove, where the Armada has been successful, Isabella Clara Eugenia is temporarily made Queen of England.
*In the 2007 film &quot;&quot;, Isabella appeared in a minor role at the side of her father, Philip II of Spain, at the time of the attempted invasion of England by the Spanish Armada in 1588. The movie portrays Isabella as Philip&#x27;s choice to replace Elizabeth on the throne of England. She was portrayed by actress Aimee King as a young girl rather than at the correct age of 19 years.

<text>Henry Oliver Rinnan (14 May 1915 – 1 February 1947) was a notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent in the area around Trondheim Municipality, Norway during World War II.

Rinnan led a group called &quot;Sonderabteilung Lola&quot;. This group, known as &quot;Rinnanbanden&quot; among Norwegians, had fifty known members. Among them were Karl Dolmen, Arild Hjulstad-Østby and Ivar and Kitty Grande.

==Biography==
Born in Levanger on 14 May 1915, Rinnan was the eldest of eight children in an impoverished family. Standing at , he was unusually short for a Norwegian man. He was a loner during his childhood. He worked briefly for his uncle, but was sacked for theft.

During the Winter War, Rinnan tried to enlist with the Finns to fight against the Soviet Union, but was rejected due to his poor physique. During the Norwegian Campaign in 1940, he drove a truck for the Norwegian Army. According to Rinnan, he was recruited by the Gestapo in June 1940. His parents were members of Nasjonal Samling, but it is uncertain if he ever was a member. After the war, former members of Nasjonal Samling attempted to disassociate themselves from the group, which was seen as a pro-German unit.

Beginning in September 1943, the &quot;Rinnanbanden&quot; had its headquarters in Jonsvannsveien 46 in Trondheim, known as &quot;Bandeklosteret&quot; (&quot;gang monastery&quot;). Rinnan worked closely with the German Sicherheitspolizei in Trondheim, where his main contacts were Gerhard Flesch and Walter Gemmecke. During this decade the private residence of the Rinnan family was in the captured house of Landstads Vei 1, located approximately one kilometre from the gang&#x27;s headquarters.

The members of the independent Gestapo unit &quot;Sonderabteilung Lola&quot; infiltrated the resistance movement by engaging people in conversation in buses, trains, cafés, etc., encouraging them to talk about their attitudes toward the Nazi occupation. Having identified people who they thought were in the resistance, Rinnan&#x27;s agents worked to build trust with them and penetrate their networks. The Rinnan gang was responsible for the death of at least a hundred people in the Norwegian resistance and the British Special Operations Executive, for torturing hundreds of prisoners, for more than a thousand arrests, for compromising several hundred resistance groups, and in some cases, for deceiving people into carrying out missions for the Germans. Rinnan operated with impunity and almost no interference from his German taskmasters, often using murder and torture as sanctioned means.

During the war Rinnan was appointed &quot;SS-Untersturmführer der Reserve&quot;, and received the Iron Cross 2nd grade in 1944.

After Germany&#x27;s capitulation in May 1945, Rinnan and a band of followers tried to escape into Sweden, but were caught. On 24 December he escaped from prison again and gathered some followers, but they were again apprehended after a few days.

In the course of two trials after the war, forty-one members of the Rinnan group were convicted and sentenced. Twelve received sentences of execution by firing squad from the Frostating Court of Appeal on 20 September 1946. Ten of those death sentences were carried out. Eleven other defendants were sentenced to lifelong forced labour (later pardoned), while the rest were given long prison sentences.

Rinnan was sentenced for personally murdering thirteen people, but the real number may be higher. Four hours after midnight on 1 February 1947, Rinnan was taken from his cell in Kristiansten Fortress. A guard blindfolded him and led him outside, where he was tied to a pole. He showed no emotion. At 04:05, Rinnan was executed by firing squad. He was cremated, and later unofficially buried at the Levanger Cemetery in an unmarked grave.

Forty percent of the people executed as a result of Norwegian war crimes trials after the Second World War were connected to Sonderabteilung Lola.

<text>Hans Zenker (10 August 1870 in Bielitz – 18 August 1932 in Göttingen) was a German admiral.

==Biography==
Born in Bielitz (now Bielsko-Biała, Poland), he entered the Imperial German Navy on 13 April 1889. After serving as captain of several torpedo boats, he commanded in turn the light cruisers in 1911 and in 1912–13. As captain of the battlecruiser in 1916–17, Zenker saw action in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916.

Zenker joined the Admiralty Staff in 1917. He was appointed to the North Sea area command in 1918, holding this post when the German war effort collapsed in November 1918.

After the war, he was an officer of the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot;, serving as &quot;Inspekteur der Marineartillerie&quot; from 1920 to 1923 and the top post of &quot;Chef der Marineleitung&quot; (Chief of the Naval Command) from October 1, 1924, to September 30, 1928. His tenure as head of the Reichsmarine saw the beginning of the rebuilding of the German fleet with the construction of light cruisers and torpedo boats and the planning of ships, later built as the &quot;Deutschland&quot;, &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;, and &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;.

==Family==
The last years of his life Zenker spent in Osterode am Harz. His son, Karl-Adolf Zenker (1907-1998), held the office equivalent to Chef der Marineleitung—Inspector of the Navy—in the West German Bundesmarine from 1961 to 1967.
