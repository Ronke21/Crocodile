<text>You Rang, M&#x27;Lord? is a BBC television sitcom written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft, the creators of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. It was broadcast between 29 December 1988 and 24 April 1993 on the BBC. The show was set in the house of an aristocratic family in the 1920s, contrasting the upper-class family and their servants in a house in London, along the same lines as the drama &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;.

The series featured many actors who had previously appeared in earlier works by Perry and Croft, notably Paul Shane, Jeffrey Holland and Su Pollard, all of whom had starred in &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;; also featured were Donald Hewlett and Michael Knowles from &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;, and Bill Pertwee and occasionally Frank Williams from &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. Numerous small parts were played by other alumni of David Croft and/or Jimmy Perry shows. The memorable 1920s-style theme tune was sung by comedian Bob Monkhouse.

Episodes of &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot; were fifty minutes long, rather than the usual thirty (for BBC sitcoms), and attempted to introduce a more reflective approach and more complex plotting than other Croft and Perry series. There was also less reliance on filmed location sequences.

==Production==
The series, like other situation comedies of its time, was filmed in front of a live studio audience. Mark Lewisohn said the writers were careful to ensure the sets, lighting and camerawork were of a quality associated with drama productions such as &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot;. For a situation comedy, the episodes are an unconventional length (50 minutes). Croft felt this would let them develop characters and situations more thoroughly. This was supported by Gareth Gwenlan, head of BBC comedy. Also unconventional for a Perry/Croft series was the fact that plots directly continued from episode to episode like a soap opera as opposed to being largely standalone episodes such as in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;.

This, coupled with high production values and attention to period detail, was designed to give the series the feel of a comedy drama. In writing the series, the two writers drew on research and personal accounts from the period; Jimmy Perry&#x27;s grandfather had been in service as a butler and David Croft&#x27;s mother, Anne Croft, had been a musical comedy star in the 1920s, giving them some ideas of life both above and below stairs.

The pilot episode was meant to be recorded at the BBC Television Centre in London, but due to a strike the sets were sparsely dressed and production was moved to the BBC Elstree Studios instead. The sets were improved for the first series. After the pilot was aired and the BBC agreed to a full series, the production team decided to remain at BBC Elstree Studios, and all four series of the show were recorded there. Exterior shots were mostly filmed in and around Diss, Norfolk, for example a disused brush factory which was used as the Union Jack Rubber Company. Other locations included the seafront at Cromer, Lynford Hall, Bayfield Hall and Oxburgh Hall as the bishop&#x27;s palace. The First World War battle scene at the beginning of the pilot episode was built in Long Valley, the British Army&#x27;s tank training ground in Aldershot. The exterior of the Meldrum house is rarely seen, although the pilot featured exterior shots of an actual building, probably No. 15, Holland Villas Road, London W14, but later shootings took place at a mock-up built on the car park at BBC Elstree Studios or in Norfolk.

The first two series were directed by David Croft who then handed over directing duties to Roy Gould, his production manager for many years, for series three and four.

The series&#x27; opening and closing music was written by Jimmy Perry and Roy Moore and performed by a 1920s-style orchestra. The vocals were performed by Bob Monkhouse and Paul Shane.

==Plot==
In the pilot episode, two World War I soldiers stumble across the body of an officer while crossing no-man&#x27;s land under heavy gunfire during the Battle of Amiens in 1918. Assuming the officer is dead, one soldier, Alf Stokes, attempts to rob the officer, much to the disgust of his comrade, James Twelvetrees. After it becomes apparent that the unconscious officer is not dead, the two men see their chance to escape the battle by carrying the officer to a field hospital. The two soldiers are later called to see the officer, The Honourable Teddy Meldrum, who says he is eternally grateful for their services, and tells them he will always be in their debt.

The action then moves to London in 1927, where James Twelvetrees has become the footman in the house of Teddy&#x27;s brother Lord Meldrum, at 12 Park Lane, Mayfair, and wants to further his position following the death of the butler.

Meanwhile, Alf and his daughter, Ivy, have just been sacked from their jobs in a music hall (Alf took the music hall job after being dismissed for dishonesty as a butler). Alf sees his chance to apply for a job at the Meldrum&#x27;s house, and after blackmailing his previous employer for references, becomes the new butler, much to the annoyance of James. Following the dismissal of a maid, after a backstairs relationship with the Honourable Teddy, Ivy is brought in by her father as the new maid (to hide the fact that she is Alf&#x27;s daughter, the two decide that Ivy should use her mother&#x27;s maiden name, Teasdale).

The programme follows the various relationships between the upper-class and their servants, as well as Alf&#x27;s scheming and James&#x27;s attempts to stop him. The events depicted in the 26 episodes are time-lined though not directly following each other and are based mainly around the following threads:

* Moral combat between Alf, James and Ivy, as Alf keeps developing schemes in order to achieve some fortune (and usually fails) and James and Ivy try to stop his actions
*Clashes about politics between James and Alf (James is a Conservative voter whilst Alf often talks of class struggle and revolution)
* Adultery triangle between Lord Meldrum, Lady Agatha and Sir Ralph
* James arousing romantic interest in Poppy, Lady Agatha, and Ivy
* Developing love affair between Alf and Mrs. Lipton, and between Mrs. Lipton and Police Constable Wilson
* Efforts of Teddy to dodge the marriage with Madge Cartwright
* Teddy&#x27;s pursuit of servant girls
* Lord Meldrum&#x27;s threats to deport Teddy to his rubber plantation in British Malaya;
* Ivy&#x27;s growing affections for James
* Business rise, fall and recovery of the House of Meldrum and its most important asset, the Union Jack Rubber Company;
* The unpredictable actions of Lady Lavender

==Characters==
===The Meldrum Family===
*George, Lord Meldrum GCB, MC (Donald Hewlett) – The master of the house, Lord Meldrum is a respected member of the aristocracy, in charge of the Union Jack Rubber Company and various other interests. Old-fashioned, with Victorian values, his reputation is nevertheless threatened by his affair with Lady Agatha, the wife of Sir Ralph Shawcross, and it is usually left to Stokes to help him cover this up. He claims to deeply love Agatha, and is left heartbroken after she breaks off their affair. Despite his considerable wealth, he pays his workers poorly, and it is hinted that he once employed slave labour in Africa.
*The Honourable Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Meldrum (Michael Knowles) – Lord Meldrum&#x27;s younger brother, he had been conscripted as a Captain into the British Army in 1915 and had served in the Infantry on the Western Front, where he was badly injured by a shell and carried back to the field hospital by Stokes and Twelvetrees. By 1927 the Honourable Teddy is still unmarried and living in his brother&#x27;s house. The stereotypical upper-class twit, he has had relationships with five previous housemaids and has fathered children by them all: he cannot resist their &quot;shiny, scrubbed faces&quot; and scent of carbolic soap. He is being forced by his brother to marry Madge Cartwright, the heiress to a soap dynasty, although he is more interested in her maid, Rose.
*Cecily &quot;Cissy&quot; Meldrum (Catherine Rabett) – Cissy is Lord Meldrum&#x27;s elder daughter. Although attractive, she dresses in a masculine style, takes part in men&#x27;s sports and activities, such as flying (she is a qualified pilot), and her feminine &quot;chum&quot; Penelope (Sorel Johnson) is a frequent house guest. Thus, although never explicitly stated, there are many suggestions that Cissy is a lesbian, the many clues to which are not entirely obvious to her father. Cissy is a pleasant character, who shows genuine concern for the family and servants alike, often giving away feminine items such as dresses and make-up to Ivy (whom she shows an attraction to in early episodes, frequently winking at her). She often socialises with her younger sister Poppy, but the two regularly bicker because of their differing attitudes. She proclaims herself a socialist and stands as a candidate for the United Workers Party, winning a seat on the council through Stokes&#x27;s machinations.
*Poppy Meldrum (Susie Brann) – Poppy is Lord Meldrum&#x27;s younger daughter and is a spoiled and unpleasant character who attends &#x27;wild&#x27; parties with her friend, Jerry (John D. Collins). She is quite a snob about her position in society, often ready to remind those lower of her position, although at other times she confesses to feeling trapped by her class. Throughout the series, she is attracted to the footman, James Twelvetrees, whom she delights in leading on, despite being aware of the problems it could cause for him. She has an on-off relationship with Jerry, who she abandons when she meets Dickie Metcalf, who is in fact a confidence trickster and is after her money.
*Lady Lavender Southwick (Mavis Pugh) – Lady Lavender is Lord Meldrum&#x27;s mother-in-law and she resides with her parrot, Captain, in the second bedroom of the house. She is very wealthy and has interests in many businesses including a large number of shares in the Union Jack Rubber Company. Lavender was born into an aristocratic family in the early 1850s. We are given to understand that she led a somewhat promiscuous youth, having many affairs, including with Boris the Crown Prince (later King) of Dalmatia (Davy Kaye). She then became involved with a young army officer called Captain Cedric Dolby (Maurice Denham); the two later became engaged, but separated shortly before he was sent off to fight in the Zulu War. After the death of her husband, Lord Southwick, Lady Lavender moved in with her daughter and son-in-law, becoming increasingly reclusive and senile, and enjoyed throwing plates of food at Ivy, the maid. She calls the servants by alternative names of her choosing (calling Ivy &#x27;Ethel&#x27;, Henry &#x27;Steven&#x27; and Stokes &#x27;Capes&#x27;). She has no idea who Teddy is (when he explains he is &quot;George&#x27;s brother&quot; she comments she has a son-in-law with that name).

===Servants===
*Alf Stokes (Paul Shane) Butler – Alf Stokes is the scheming Butler. He is Ivy&#x27;s father and is still married to Ivy&#x27;s mother, despite their separation. Alf was a Private in the British Army on the Western Front, along with James Twelvetrees. After coming across the Honourable Teddy unconscious in a shell hole, Alf, believing him to be dead, attempted to mug him, much to James&#x27; disgust. After realising Teddy was alive, Alf decided to carry the injured Teddy back to the field hospital as a way of saving his own life. This act secures him the job as Butler nine years later at Lord Meldrum&#x27;s house, after he is forced to return to service following a failed career in showbiz after the war. Throughout the series, Alf devises a number of schemes to scam Lord Meldrum of his money and possessions, although these usually fail. This dishonest aspect of his character was often an asset to Lord Meldrum; on a number of occasions Alf was required to create diversions for Sir Ralph. Alf despises the Meldrum family due to their wealth and high position, although he has genuine respect for Cissy due to her empathy for the working class. Alf also has a relationship with Mrs Lipton through the series, although it is revealed he did this just to borrow money from her.
*James Twelvetrees (Jeffrey Holland) Footman – James Twelvetrees is the pompous Footman; the complete opposite of Alf Stokes – stern, upright and honest. His act of helping Alf carry the injured Honourable Teddy to the field hospital during the war also secured him his job in the Meldrum household, although he would never admit this to the other servants. He is not always a likeable character, usually siding with his masters instead of his own class and was often quite unpleasant to the other servants and those he considered lower than him, particularly Mabel and Henry. He is also shown to have his own foibles, such as his infatuation with Miss Poppy, a relationship which left him contemplating resignation at times. He is desired by many of the upper class ladies he served and downstairs by Ivy; this was not reciprocated, although he did show a platonic fondness for her. He aspires to replace Stokes as butler.
*Ivy Stokes/Teasdale (Su Pollard) Maid – Ivy is the well-meaning but rather naïve maid, the daughter of Alf. Her father secured her the job as maid after he was appointed as Butler by forging her references. Her familial relationship with Alf is largely a secret, but she is forced to tell Henry when he spots the two alone in her bedroom, and later tells James when she needs his help to get Alf out of trouble. Despite her honesty, she is often persuaded to take part in her father&#x27;s schemes. Earlier in the series, she has to avoid the advances of the Honourable Teddy, although this ceases after series 1. (By season 2 Teddy has started pursuing a relationship with a servant girl called Rose and apologises to Ivy). She is passionately in love with James Twelvetrees, who does not reciprocate her affection.
*Mrs Blanche Lipton (Brenda Cowling) Cook – Blanche Lipton had joined the Meldrum household as a young housemaid in her teens and had gradually risen through the ranks to become cook. Her culinary skills are legendary on the street; she is rarely seen out of the kitchen. While usually a kindly woman who shows sympathy for her betters and equals, at other times she is particularly scathing towards those she considers lower, such as Henry and Mabel. Throughout the series she has a relationship with Alf; at one point the two are engaged. When she discovers that Alf was faking the relationship just to borrow money from her, she snaps and throws all the dinner plates and crockery at him. After this incident, Blanche then shifts her affections to Constable Wilson.
*Henry Livingstone (Perry Benson) Bootboy – Henry was abandoned as a child in a basket on the steps of the Livingston Road Orphanage, in which institution he remained until the age of 14, when he was taken into the Meldrum house as bootboy. Although the second-lowest ranking servant in the house, Henry is often the most insightful character, something which usually gets him into trouble; for not conforming to the expected etiquette and making inappropriate comments, he is usually soundly clipped about the ear. He is a good friend of Ivy, and it is often suggested that he would like a relationship with her.
*Mabel Wheeler (Barbara New) Charwoman – Mabel is the lowest-ranking servant in the Meldrum household. She does not live at the Meldrum house and resides with her unemployed husband in a poor part of London. She is regarded by some of the others as an outsider, James and Mrs. Lipton in particular. Because of her low rank and social status, she is not allowed to have meals with the other servants, and is usually given some scraps to take home, which gave rise to her catchphrases &quot;That&#x27;ll be nice(!)&quot; and &quot;I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a...&quot;.

===Other Characters - Regular===
*Constable Wilson (Bill Pertwee) – Police Constable Wilson is the local Bobby, although he rarely appears to be doing his duty. Instead he dines nightly with the servants, as was apparently the custom because the police would then overlook any indiscretion made by the family. He is generally ineffective as a policeman, although he becomes something of a wine connoisseur, due to his nightly selection from Lord Meldrum&#x27;s cellar.

===Other Characters - Recurring===
*Sir Ralph Shawcross (John Horsley) – Sir Ralph is another wealthy member of London society, with two residences; a London house and a country residence. He is married to Lady Agatha (her third husband) and is initially suspicious of Lord Meldrum&#x27;s relationship with his wife, but eventually comes to regard him as a friend after he is led to believe that Meldrum is impotent and therefore not a threat. When the truth is revealed, he seeks revenge on Meldrum.
*Lady Agatha Shawcross (Angela Scoular) – Lady Agatha is the wife of Sir Ralph and is also Lord Meldrum&#x27;s mistress. She conducts her affair with Lord Meldrum even when her husband is present in the house by secretly giving him sleeping pills. She had previously been assistant matron at Eton but had been sacked following an incident with a number of students. She had two previous husbands before she married Sir Ralph, but also had plenty of lovers, whom she entertains at her mews apartment.
*Madge Cartwright (Yvonne Marsh) – The sole heiress to the Cartwright Soap business empire, she resides in a luxury flat in Mayfair and is a regular visitor to the house. She is a longtime admirer of Teddy, and the two become engaged. She does not realise that Teddy secretly despises her and is instead infatuated with her maid, Rose (Amanda Bellamy).
*Charles, the Lord Bishop (Frank Williams) – Charles is the Lord Bishop, and a close friend of the family. He is a frequent visitor at the Meldrum house, often accompanied by his young chaplain, Robin (Robbie Barnett).

===Other characters===
As with the main cast, a number of other characters were played by actors who have appeared in Perry/Croft series, including Felix Bowness, John Clegg, Kenneth Connor, Stuart McGugan, John D. Collins, Ivor Roberts, and Alex Leam (who went on to appear in Oh, Doctor Beeching! in a recurring yet uncredited role)

==Episodes==
==Reception and release==

The series was not initially well received by the critics, and is less well-known than other Croft sitcoms, such as &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;, &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; and &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; (the latter two of these were co-written by Croft with Jeremy Lloyd).

Reviewing the series ten years later, Mark Lewisohn notes that unlike previous Croft/Perry series, the lead characters were not &quot;loveable&quot;, stating:

...in fact, Alf was quite menacing and James was just too snobbish and unbending a character to generate a response from the audience. This combination of production values and darker characterisation seemed to work against the series, and the normally loud and broad humour of such ensemble romps was uncomfortable in the surroundings. While far from a ratings disaster, it nonetheless failed to attract the level of audiences normally reached by Perry and Croft.

Simon Morgan-Russell, Professor of English at Bowling Green State University is more complimentary, noting that &quot;Unlike other Perry and Croft sitcoms, You Rang, M&#x27;Lord? has a distinct serial structure, though it is also the most stable example of their work in terms of maintaining the original situational concept and the cast&quot;. He goes on to compliment the series&#x27; examination of class, sexuality and gender issues, as well as the heritage cinema-inspired period detail of the piece, particularly in its location filming.

Bill Pertwee believed that the series was Croft and Perry&#x27;s &quot;crowning glory&quot; as a writing partnership.

The series was the first British sitcom to feature a recurring lesbian character, in Cissy Meldrum. The character has generated mixed reactions. Anthony Joseph Paul Cortese&#x27;s &quot;Opposing Hate Speech&quot; suggests that Cissy is &quot;the archetypal stereotype for a lesbian...[using]...non-flattering stereotypes&quot;. Alison Darren&#x27;s &quot;Lesbian Film Guide&quot; is much more positive, stating &quot;&quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot; gave us the wonderful Cissy (...replete with monacle and a series of beautifully tailored suits).&quot; She goes on to note the character&#x27;s &quot;championing of the workers&quot; suggesting that throughout her character &quot;behaved with integrity and style.&quot; 
The BBC Comedy Guide criticises the show: &quot;for most of their career Perry and Croft had turned clichés on their heads and created characters that went beyond normal. The research and interest they showed in the 20s setting and &#x27;getting it right&#x27; in You Rang... seems to have made them forget to put many laughs in.&quot;

&quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot; has rarely been repeated on television, which Croft believed was probably due to its unusual length, which does not suit current broadcasting slots (his other series such as &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; and &quot;″Allo, &#x27;Allo&quot; are 30 minutes in duration). However, all four series have been released on DVD, both individually and as a box set.

The show acquired a following in Hungary where a version dubbed into Hungarian was broadcast following the fall of Communism in the country. A fan club has nearly 23,000 followers and in 2018, a celebratory banquet was held in Budapest attended by actors Jeffrey Holland, Michael Knowles, Catherine Rabett, Susie Brann and Amanda Bellamy to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the pilot episode.

The show started a complete re-run on 3 April 2018 on UKTV&#x27;s Drama channel in the afternoon Comedy Slot, and also shortly thereafter on GOLD. It is also being shown on That&#x27;s TV in 2024.

In addition, all four series are available individually along with a box set of the complete collection as digital downloads from the iTunes Store.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-155 is a modified Tupolev Tu-154 (СССР-85035) which was used as an alternative fuel testbed, and was the world&#x27;s first experimental aircraft operating on hydrogen and later liquid natural gas. The similar Tu-156 was never built.

==Design and development==

The Tu-155 first flew on 15 April 1988. It used first liquid hydrogen and later liquified natural gas (LNG). It flew until the demise of the Soviet Union and it is currently stored at Ramenskoye Airport near Zhukovskiy. The Tu-156 was intended to fly circa 1997, but was cancelled due to the end of the Soviet Union. The aircraft used cryogenics to store fuel. The Tu-155 was a hybrid, only one of its three Kuznetsov NK-8 engines (they are now called NK-88) was actually powered by hydrogen. The fuel tank was located in the air-blown (or nitrogen) rear compartment. A distinctive feature of the aircraft is that the protrusion of the ventilation system is visible on the tail (near the no. 2 engine). The Tu-155 used Kuznetsov NK-88 engines. The Tu-156 was intended to use Kuznetsov NK-89 engines. The Tu-155 flew approximately 100 flights before it was placed in storage. However, only some flights were performed with hydrogen. From January 1989, Tupolev was mainly testing natural gas as a substitute for kerosene.

<text>TVT is Tasmania&#x27;s first television station, delivering its first official broadcast on 23 May 1960. The callsign stands for &quot;TeleVision Tasmania&quot;. Unlike the commercial stations in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, and later Perth, TVT held a monopoly in the Hobart market for many years (not unlike CTC in Canberra and NTD in Darwin).

Initially it broadcast from the Mount Wellington transmitter on VHF channel 6, to all of Hobart. Its broadcast licence area covered all of southern Tasmania, these areas being reached by various repeaters and retransmitters.

It continued to broadcast as TVT-6 until 1982, where it was bought by ENT, owner of Launceston station TNT-9. Both stations began broadcasting under the unified on-air identity of TasTV by 1985, thus becoming for the first time a statewide network. ENT also owned Vic TV in regional Victoria.

In 1988, TNT-9 was sold to Tricom Corporation (later Southern Cross Broadcasting), leaving TVT-6 continuing to service the south as TasTV. And with the dawn of statewide aggregation rising in the early 1990s, TasTV began its preparation, this time as the Nine Network affiliate for the state on the very moment it would restart broadcasts to Northern Tasmania thanks to aggregation. TasTV aired most Nine Network programs, some are the programs from Seven Network and Network Ten. It adopted Nine&#x27;s idents and campaigns and a new slogan, &quot;First in Tasmania&quot;, in 1993, and the news service was reconfigured to that of Nine&#x27;s.

The biggest change to Tasmanian television came in 1994 when aggregation occurred. This allowed both TasTV (TVT-6) and Southern Cross (TNT-9) to broadcast across the entire state and for the first time, give Tasmanians a choice of commercial stations. TasTV, now once again broadcasting all over the state, officially confirmed itself as the Nine Network affiliate and Southern Cross held dual Seven and Ten affiliations.

In October of that year, WIN Corporation bought ENT in a forced takeover and thus TasTV became WIN Tasmania, the state division of the growing regional network. It still uses the callsign TVT-6 for its Hobart and southern Tasmania licence.

In 2002, WIN Corporation and Southern Cross Broadcasting formed a joint venture company to broadcast a third commercial station, Tasmanian Digital Television, in a digital-only format as a Ten affiliate.

On 1 July 2016, as part of a wide national re-alignment of regional television, TVT swapped affiliations with TDT switching from Nine Network to Network Ten, but TVT rebroadcast a feed of ATV-10 from Melbourne with local ads.

On 1 July 2021, as the reverse of the 2016 swap, TVT once again swapped affiliations with TDT switching from Network 10 back to the Nine Network, but TVT rebroadcasts a feed of GTV-9 from Melbourne with local ads.

On 16 June 2022, WIN Television Tasmania (TVT) converted 9Gem and 9Go! to MPEG-4 SD channels, as a test for the rest of the areas covered by WIN.

The station is affiliated with the metropolitan Nine Network and also broadcasts most of Nine&#x27;s sub-channels (9Gem, 9Go! and 9Life) except it doesn’t broadcast 9Rush.

==Programming==
WIN Television Tasmania (TVT) broadcasts its programming from the Nine Network, including their regional signals of Channel Nine, 9Gem, 9Go!, 9Life and 9Rush. WIN also broadcasts news, current affairs and sport programs such as &quot;Today Extra&quot;, &quot;Nine News&quot;, &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, &quot;Nine&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot; and Today all over Tasmania.

==WIN News Tasmania==
&quot;WIN News&quot; produces a half-hour weeknight local news bulletin five days a week. Briefly, the bulletin became an hour-long state-based bulletin in an attempt to rival Seven affiliate Southern Cross’ nightly news bulletin, but was reverted to a half-hour years later.

Weekend bulletins were previously discontinued on Sunday 26 June 2011 – they were replaced by simulcasts of the Melbourne edition of &quot;Nine News&quot; until they were reintroduced on Saturday 14 July 2012.

As part of the Ten affiliation swap deal, WIN News Tasmania moved to 6.00pm weeknights &amp; 5.30pm on weekends (originally 5.30pm weekdays and weeknights, replacing Ten&#x27;s Melbourne bulletin), launching a new look.

Until the early 1980s, TVT broadcast Seven News from HSV-7 in Melbourne.

<doc id="561445" wikidata="Q13548323" url="?curid=561445" title="Naugahyde">
<text>Naugahyde is an American brand of artificial leather. Naugahyde is a composite knit fabric backing and expanded polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coating. It was developed by Byron A. Hunter, a senior chemist at the United States Rubber Company, and is now manufactured and sold by the corporate spin-off Uniroyal Engineered Products LLC.

Its name, first used as a trademark in 1936, comes from the name of Naugatuck, Connecticut, where it was first produced. It is now manufactured in Stoughton, Wisconsin.

== Uses ==
The primary use for Naugahyde is as a substitute for leather in upholstery. In this application it is very durable and can be easily maintained by wiping with a damp sponge or cloth. Being a synthetic product, it is supplied in long rolls, allowing large sections of furniture to be covered seamlessly, unlike animal hides.

General Motors for several decades used the material in several of its vehicles, with the term &quot;Cordaveen&quot; and later &quot;Madrid-grain vinyl&quot; for Buick, &quot;Morocceen&quot; for Oldsmobile, and &quot;Morrokide&quot; for Pontiac vehicles, while Chevrolet didn&#x27;t use a brand name and simply listed it in sales brochures as &quot;vinyl interior&quot;.

==Marketing==

A marketing campaign of the 1960s and 1970s asserted humorously that Naugahyde was obtained from the skin of an animal called a &quot;Nauga&quot;. The claim became an urban myth. The campaign emphasized that, unlike other animals, which must typically be slaughtered to obtain their hides, Naugas can shed their skin without harm to themselves. The Nauga doll, a squat, horned monster with a wide, toothy grin, became popular in the 1960s and is still sold today.

<doc id="561448" wikidata="Q2723893" url="?curid=561448" title="Emergency Banking Act of 1933">
<text>The Emergency Banking Act (EBA) (the official title of which was the Emergency Banking Relief Act), Public Law 73-1, 48 Stat. 1 (March 9, 1933), was an act passed by the United States Congress in March 1933 in an attempt to stabilize the banking system.

== Bank holiday ==
Beginning on February 14, 1933, Michigan, an industrial state that had been hit particularly hard by the Great Depression in the United States, declared an eight-day bank holiday. Fears of other bank closures spread from state to state as people rushed to withdraw their deposits while they still could do so. Within weeks, all other states held their own bank holidays in an attempt to stem the bank runs, with Delaware becoming the 48th and last state to close its banks on March 4.

Following his inauguration on March 4, 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt set out to rebuild confidence in the nation&#x27;s banking system and to stabilize America&#x27;s banking system. On March 6, he declared a four-day &quot;national&quot; banking holiday that kept all banks shut until Congress could act. During this time, the federal government would inspect all banks, re-open those that were sufficiently solvent, re-organize those that could be saved, and close those that were beyond repair.

== Passage of the Emergency Banking Act ==

A draft law, prepared by the Treasury staff during Herbert Hoover&#x27;s administration, was passed on March 9, 1933. The new law allowed the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets so that banks that reopened would be able to meet every legitimate call.
The Emergency Banking Act, an amendment to the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, was introduced on March 9, 1933, to a joint session of Congress, and was passed the same evening amid an atmosphere of chaos and uncertainty as over 100 new Democratic members of Congress swept into power determined to take radical steps to address banking failures and other economic malaise. 

The EBA was one of President Roosevelt&#x27;s first projects in the first 100 days of his presidency. The sense of urgency was such that the act was passed with only a single copy available on the floor of the House of Representatives and legislators voted on it after the bill was read aloud to them by Chairman of the House Banking Committee Henry Steagall. Copies were made available to senators as the bill was being proposed in the Senate, after it had passed in the House.

According to William L. Silber: &quot;The Emergency Banking Act of 1933, passed by Congress on March 9, 1933, three days after FDR declared a nationwide bank holiday, combined with the Federal Reserve&#x27;s commitment to supply unlimited amounts of currency to reopened banks, created 100 percent deposit insurance&quot;.

On March 12, the evening before banks began to reopen, FDR gave his first fireside chat, a national radio address explaining the alterations made by the federal government on the banking industry. Due to confidence in FDR and the proposed alterations, Americans returned $1 billion to bank vaults in the following week.

== Public reaction ==
Much to everyone&#x27;s relief, when the institutions reopened for business on March 13, 1933, depositors stood in line to return their stashed cash to neighborhood banks. Within two weeks, Americans had redeposited more than half of the currency that they had legally withdrawn before the bank suspension. 

The stock market registered its approval as well. On March 15, 1933, the first day of stock trading after the extended closure of Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, gaining 8.26 points to close at 62.10; a gain of 15.34%. , the gain still stands as the largest one-day percentage price increase ever. In hindsight, the nationwide Bank Holiday and the Emergency Banking Act of March 1933 are seen to have ended the bank runs that plagued the Great Depression.

== Possession of monetary gold becomes a crime ==
One month later, on April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 criminalizing the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation and Congress passed a similar resolution in June 1933.

== 1933 Banking Act ==
This act was a temporary response to a major problem and remains in effect to this day. The 1933 Banking Act passed later that year presented elements of longer-term response, including the formation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

<text>In Sikhism, &#x27; (Gurmukhi: ਚੜ੍ਹਦੀ ਕਲਾ &quot;caṛhadī kalā&quot;) or Charhdi Kala&quot;, is the [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] term for aspiring to maintain a mental state of eternal resilience, [[optimism]] and [[joy]]; an acceptance that life ebbs and flows with hardship and to rise above that adversity. Sikhs are ideally expected to be in this positive state of mind as a sign of their contentment with the will of God (&#x27;), even during times of suffering.

== Description ==
Chardi Kala can be translated as &quot;positive attitude&quot; or &quot;ascending energy&quot;. It is also described as being in &quot;high spirits&quot; or “positive, buoyant and optimistic” attitude to life and to the future. Chardi kala is the state of mind in which a person has no negative emotions like fear, jealousy or enmity. Instead the mind has many positive feelings including joy, satisfaction and self-dignity.

Sikhs believe in the will of God (&quot;bhana&quot;). They also believe that God is without enemies (&quot;nirvair&quot;), and is always merciful. Hence, humans should accept his will even at times one suffers severe hardship and strive to work through it, to the betterment of others. Thus, chardi kala is the indicator of a Sikh&#x27;s absolute faith in the Akal Purakh (The Timeless God). This attitude allows one to face the hardships with as little harm as possible. This also involves joining and helping others in their hour of need.

<doc id="561455" wikidata="Q1294396" url="?curid=561455" title="Edwin Astley">
<text>Edwin Thomas &quot;Ted&quot; Astley (12 April 1922 – 19 May 1998) was a British composer. His best known works are British television themes and scores, most notably the main themes for &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Danger Man&quot; and &quot;The Baron&quot;. He also successfully diversified into symphonic pop and the arrangement of his theme to &quot;The Saint&quot;, as re-recorded by Orbital, reached number three in the UK singles chart.

==Early life==
Astley was born in Warrington, Lancashire, to Lawrence Astley and Mary Alice Pester. He served in the Second World War as a musician in the Royal Army Service Corps band playing saxophone and clarinet for the troops.

==Career==
In the early 1950s, Astley was arranging for Geraldo. His song &quot;I Could Never Tell&quot; was written by Edwin and Billy Bowen as an entry into a song writing contest when they were both serving in the army. Edwin won the prize of £250 and later used this money to pay for his wedding to Hazel Balbirnie. &quot;I Could Never Tell&quot; was later recorded by both Vera Lynn and Richard Tauber.

His own band, the Ted Astley Orchestra, became well known in the north of England, and he wrote songs for performers such as Anne Shelton.

He wrote music for many British television series of the 1950s and 1960s, including incidental music for &quot;The Champions&quot;, and the opening titles to &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (with the exception for the closing titles), &quot;Danger Man&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;danger-man.co.uk/Publicity_Music&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (known as &quot;Secret Agent&quot; in North America, where a new graphic opening credit sequence was added which featured the song &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot; by P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri and was followed by the original English credits accompanied by Astley&#x27;s &quot;High Wire&quot; theme), &quot;Department S&quot;, &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot;, &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot; and &quot;The Baron&quot;. All of these programmes were ITC Entertainment productions.

Astley also wrote the orchestral and &quot;opera&quot; score for the Hammer Films version of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1962).

Astley wrote two arrangements of his own theme for &quot;The Saint&quot;, a slow version used in the black and white episodes and a more up-tempo arrangement of the same theme for the colour episodes. He then wrote a second theme, used in the second season of the colour episodes, based around Leslie Charteris&#x27; own theme music, which had previously been used in films and on radio. Charteris&#x27; theme would also open its main theme to &quot;Return of the Saint&quot; and would close its theme for its TV movies of &quot;The Saint&quot; which starred Simon Dutton (neither of which were composed by Astley); however, Astley&#x27;s original &quot;Saint&quot; theme was chosen for the film of the same name.

Astley also wrote two themes for &quot;Danger Man&quot; – one for the 30-minute series transmitted from 1960 to 1962 entitled &quot;The Danger Man Theme&quot;, and a new theme for the 60 minute series (1964–68) entitled &quot;High Wire&quot;. Astley was asked to write music for &quot;The Prisoner&quot;, but had to withdraw because he felt that he would be unable to create Patrick McGoohan&#x27;s vision for the score – due to McGoohan being too busy to hold meetings with him.

However, Astley showed his diversity by writing the music for Sir Kenneth Clark&#x27;s BBC documentary series &quot;Civilisation&quot; (1969), and scoring several British Transport Films including &quot;Diesel Train Ride&quot; (1959), &quot;Broad Waterways&quot; (1959/60) and &quot;The Signal Engineers&quot; (1962).

In 1997, Astley found himself at number three on the UK singles chart as composer of &quot;The Saint&quot;, 33 years after he wrote it, which had been revived by Orbital for the new &quot;Saint&quot; movie. His last work was a 1998 symphonic interpretation of Who music called &quot;Who&#x27;s Serious: The Symphonic Music of the Who&quot;, which followed 1995&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Music of the Rolling Stones&quot;.

==Recordings==
Astley&#x27;s actual recorded output is quite sparse, consisting of a few singles and albums of the music from &quot;The Saint&quot; and &quot;Danger Man&quot;. These were only available in the United States until 1997 when he arranged for CDs to be issued in the UK, where the albums were expensive collectors&#x27; items. Other recordings included the soundtrack for &quot;International Detective&quot;, a few library records which were only semi-official and a series of albums made by the London Symphony Orchestra which featured his work.

Recently the complete recordings of the score to &quot;Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)&quot; was released by Network DVD in the UK. The three disc box-set featured over two hundred recorded music cues from the series, and a book detailing the music production.

In 1977, Astley wrote the orchestral score for &quot;Street in the City&quot;, a song recorded for the Pete Townshend and Ronnie Lane album &quot;Rough Mix&quot;.

==Personal life==
Astley married Hazel Balbirnie in 1945, and had five children. Their eldest daughter, Karen, married Pete Townshend. Their son, Jon Astley, produced and remastered The Who&#x27;s reissues. Daughter Virginia Astley is a singer-songwriter. His other children are Virginia&#x27;s twin Alison, and son Gareth.

Astley retired in the late 1970s, and died in 1998. Recognition of his death was limited to brief obituaries in &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Independent.&quot; However, tributes later appeared on television and in print.

==Legacy==
In 2001, Jools Holland presented a television tribute called &quot;Astley&#x27;s Way&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vyner-Holland/Barefaced-Lies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BFI/4ce2b875558ca&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Holland had recorded the &quot;Danger Man&quot; theme earlier, and he appeared with Jools Holland&#x27;s Rhythm and Blues Orchestra to play &quot;High Wire&quot;, plus various other themes and incidental music composed by Astley. The documentary also included interviews with his widow, son Jon, daughter Virginia and son-in-law Pete Townshend.

<doc id="561460" wikidata="Q1163960" url="?curid=561460" title="Hack and slash">
<text>Hack and slash, also known as hack and slay (H&amp;S or HnS) or slash &#x27;em up, refers to a type of gameplay that emphasizes combat with melee-based weapons (such as swords or blades). They may also feature projectile-based weapons as well (such as guns) as secondary weapons. It is a sub-genre of beat &#x27;em up games, which focuses on melee combat, usually with swords.

The term &quot;hack and slash&quot; was originally used to describe a play style in tabletop role-playing games, carrying over from there to MUDs, massively multiplayer online role-playing games, and role-playing video games. In arcade and console style action video games, the term has an entirely different usage, specifically referring to action games with a focus on real-time combat with hand-to-hand weapons as opposed to guns or fists. The two types of hack-and-slash games are largely unrelated, though action role-playing games may combine elements of both.

==Types of hack-and-slash games==

===Action video games===
In the context of action video games, the terms &quot;hack and slash&quot; or &quot;slash &#x27;em up&quot; refer to melee weapon-based action games that are a sub-genre of beat &#x27;em ups. Traditional 2D side-scrolling examples include Taito&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Kage&quot; (1985) and &quot;Rastan&quot; (1987), Sega&#x27;s arcade video game series &quot;Shinobi&quot; (1987 debut) and &quot;Golden Axe&quot; (1989 debut), Data East&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Captain Silver&quot; (1987), Tecmo&#x27;s early &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; (&quot;Shadow Warriors&quot;) 2D games (1988 debut), Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Strider&quot; (1989), the Master System game &quot;&quot; (1990), Taito&#x27;s &quot;Saint Sword&quot; (1991), Vivid Image&#x27;s home computer game &quot;First Samurai&quot; (1991), and Vanillaware&#x27;s &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Crown&quot; (2013). The term &quot;hack-and-slash&quot; in reference to action-adventure games dates back to 1987, when &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; reviewed &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and said it had &quot;more to offer than the typical hack-and-slash&quot; epics.

In the early 21st century, journalists covering the video game industry often use the term &quot;hack and slash&quot; to refer to a distinct genre of 3D, third-person, weapon-based, melee action games. Examples include Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, &quot;Onimusha&quot;, and &quot;Sengoku Basara&quot; franchises, Koei Tecmo&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and 3D &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot; games, Sony&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and &quot;God of War&quot;, as well as &quot;Bayonetta&quot;, &quot;Darksiders&quot;, &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot;, and &quot;No More Heroes&quot;. The genre is sometimes known as &quot;character action&quot; games, and represent a modern evolution of traditional arcade action games. This subgenre of games was largely defined by Hideki Kamiya, creator of &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; and &quot;Bayonetta&quot;. In turn, &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; (2001) was influenced by earlier hack-and-slash games, including &quot;&quot; (2001) and &quot;Strider&quot;.

===Role-playing games===
The term &quot;hack and slash&quot; itself has roots in &quot;pen and paper&quot; role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (D&amp;D), denoting campaigns of violence with no other plot elements or significant goal. The term itself dates at least as far back as 1980, as shown in a &quot;Dragon&quot; article by Jean Wells and Kim Mohan which includes the following statement: &quot;There is great potential for more than hacking and slashing in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; or &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;; there is the possibility of intrigue, mystery and romance involving both sexes, to the benefit of all characters in a campaign.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wells/Mohan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Hack and slash made the transition from the tabletop to role-playing video games, usually starting in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;-like worlds. This form of gameplay influenced a wide range of action role-playing games, including games such as &quot;Xanadu&quot; and &quot;Diablo&quot;.

<doc id="561467" wikidata="Q14915579" url="?curid=561467" title="Population of the Byzantine Empire">
<text>The population of the Byzantine Empire encompassed all ethnic and tribal groups living there, mainly Byzantine Greeks, but also Albanians, Arabs, Armenians, Assyrians, Bulgarians, Goths, Latini, Serbs and other Slavs, Thracians, Tzans, Vlachs and other groups. It fluctuated throughout the state&#x27;s millennial history. The reign of the Emperor Justinian I in the mid-sixth century was the high point of the empire&#x27;s expansion; however, the arrival of plague in 541 AD and its subsequent recurrences caused a severe depletion of the population. After the reign of Emperor Heraclius () and the loss of the empire&#x27;s overseas territories, Byzantium was limited to the Balkans and Anatolia. When the empire began to recover after a series of conflicts in the 8th century and its territories stabilized, its population began to recover. By the end of the 8th century the population of the empire was around 7,000,000, a figure that climbed to over 12,000,000 people by 1025 AD. The numbers began falling steadily to 9,000,000 people at 1204 AD and even lower to 5,000,000 people at 1282 AD with the arrival of the Turks.

<text>Norah Lange (23 October 1905 – 5 August 1972) was an Argentine writer, who was associated with the Buenos Aires &quot;avant garde&quot; of the 1920s and 1930s.

==Life==

A member of the Florida group, which also included figures such as Oliverio Girondo (whom she married in 1943) and Jorge Luis Borges (who dedicated an article to her in his first book of prose, &quot;Inquisiciones&quot;), she published in the &quot;ultraist&quot; magazines &quot;Prisma&quot;, &quot;Proa&quot;, and &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;.

Her ultra-modernist poetry influenced other well-known Argentine writers such as Nydia Lamarque, Maria Elena Walsh, Maria Dhialma Tiberti, and Ines Malinow.

Her 1950 novel &quot;Personas en la sala&quot; was published in English as &quot;People in the Room&quot; (trans. Charlotte Whittle) by the publisher &quot;And Other Stories&quot; in 2018.

In 1959, SADE (the Argentine Society of writers) awarded her their Grand Prize of Honor. This was the same award as Jorge Luis Borges had been given in 1944 but his work has remained more popular and in print. It has been proposed that she has been mistakenly seen as (just) a muse and not as a leading author.

<doc id="561472" wikidata="Q335473" url="?curid=561472" title="Geoffrey Fisher">
<text>Geoffrey Francis Fisher, Baron Fisher of Lambeth, (5 May 1887 – 15 September 1972) was an English Anglican priest, and 99th Archbishop of Canterbury, serving from 1945 to 1961.

From a long line of parish priests, Fisher was educated at Marlborough College, and Exeter College, Oxford. He achieved high academic honours but was not interested in a university career. He was ordained priest in 1913, and taught at Marlborough for three years; in 1914, aged 27, he was appointed headmaster of Repton School where he served for 18 years. In 1932, having left Repton, he was made Bishop of Chester. In 1939 he accepted the post of Bishop of London, the third most senior post in the Church of England. His term of office began shortly after the start of the Second World War, and his organising skills were required to keep the diocese functioning despite the devastation of the London Blitz.

In 1944, the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Temple died suddenly, and Fisher was chosen to succeed him. He served from 1945 to 1961. One of the main themes of his time in office was church unity. He worked continually to build bridges to other Christian churches, and in 1960 became the first Archbishop of Canterbury to meet a Pope since the English Reformation, more than four centuries earlier. He overhauled the administration of the Church of England, strengthened international ties with other Anglican churches, and spoke out on a range of topical issues, from divorce to homosexuality, and the Suez crisis to nuclear disarmament.

Theologically, Fisher was nearer the Evangelical wing of the Church than the Anglo-Catholic, but strongly believed that neither had a monopoly of religious truth. His predecessor and his successor at Canterbury – Temple and Michael Ramsey – were known for scholarly spirituality; Fisher was distinguished by a simple faith combined with outstanding organisational flair. In 1961 he retired from Canterbury and for the first time in his life became a parish priest, serving as honorary curate of a country parish in Dorset. He died in 1972, aged 85.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

Fisher was born at the rectory, Higham on the Hill, Leicestershire, youngest of the ten children of the Rev. Henry Fisher and his wife Katherine, &quot;née&quot; Richmond. A Fisher had served as rector of Higham since 1772: Henry Fisher&#x27;s father and grandfather had preceded him; his eldest son, Legh, later held the post. After a short time in the Higham village school Fisher was sent to Lindley Lodge, a local preparatory school and in September 1901, having gained a scholarship, he entered Marlborough College, a public school in Wiltshire. He was greatly influenced by the headmaster, Frank Fletcher, an inspiring teacher, under whose guidance he did well both academically and in sport.

From Marlborough, Fisher won a scholarship to Exeter College, Oxford, going up in October 1906. The college had a strong Anglican tradition with both the low church evangelical and high church Anglo-Catholic wings represented. Fisher, though temperamentally inclined to the former, felt that both had much to offer. He disapproved of those in either camp who believed they had a monopoly of the truth. He rowed and played rugby for the college and distinguished himself academically, leaving with a triple first.

After completing his studies, Fisher declined two offers of lecturerships in theology from Oxford colleges. Although intellectually able he was not of an academic turn of mind. In the words of his biographer David Hein, &quot;scholars must be intellectually imaginative and also persistently dissatisfied, even sceptical, in a way that Fisher never was&quot;. He said that he did not want &quot;to go on asking questions to which there is no answer&quot;. He accepted an invitation from Fletcher to return to Marlborough as a member of the teaching staff, remaining there for three years, during which time he went to Wells Theological College during the long summer vacation in 1911, and was ordained deacon in 1912, and priest in 1913.

===Repton===
In 1914 William Temple, the headmaster of Repton School, was appointed rector of the prominent parish of St James&#x27;s, Piccadilly in London. He then encouraged Fisher to apply for the resulting vacancy at Repton, as did Fletcher. Fisher&#x27;s application was successful and he took up the headmastership in June 1914, at the age of 27.

Within two months of his appointment Fisher was confronted by problems arising from the outbreak of the First World War. Six of his teaching staff volunteered for the armed forces, as did sixty of the senior boys. As well as coping with a reduced staff and apprehension and restlessness among the pupils, Fisher had to deal with the mixed legacy he had inherited from his predecessor. Although Temple was described as &quot;religiously inspiring and intellectually stimulating&quot;, he was no disciplinarian or organiser. Fisher was characterised by &quot;The Times&quot; as combining &quot;generous humanity and a completely unaffected manner with a passion for order and efficiency&quot;.

Fisher was in charge of Repton for 18 years, during which he improved the facilities, instilled firm discipline and modernised the curriculum. His biographer Alan Webster writes:

Among Fisher&#x27;s pupils at Repton were Stuart Hampshire and Roald Dahl, both of whom complained that his personally administered beatings had been cruel. Other pupils admired &quot;his combination of extreme competence, lack of self-concern, and genial humour&quot;.

While at Repton, Fisher met Rosamond Chevallier Forman, who was the daughter of a former master at Repton and a granddaughter of S. A. Pears, a famous headmaster of the school. They were married on 12 April 1917; they had six children, all sons. Webster writes that the marriage was lifelong and mutually supportive. By the early 1930s Fisher felt that it was time to move on from Repton, and was hoping for an appointment as a parish priest, preferably in a rural parish.

===Bishop of Chester===

Temple had watched his successor&#x27;s progress at Repton, and once again intervened to further Fisher&#x27;s career. Temple, by now Archbishop of York, commended Fisher to Cosmo Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Lang was impressed enough to put Fisher&#x27;s name on the short list (of two candidates) when the see of Chester became vacant on the retirement of Luke Paget. At the time, bishops were appointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister. Ramsay MacDonald recommended Fisher to George V; the appointment was approved, and on 21 September 1932 Temple consecrated Fisher bishop in York Minster, and the following week Fisher was enthroned as Bishop of Chester at Chester Cathedral.

It was unusual for a bishop to be appointed without having any experience as a parish priest, and Fisher had to overcome reservations about him on that score from some of the clergy in his diocese. Webster writes that Fisher and his wife proved to be exceptionally hard-working, but the lack of previous pastoral experience showed:

Fisher became an advocate for rationalisation in many aspects of church life. He pointed out the discrepancies in the remuneration of the clergy, with some of them extremely poorly paid; he drew attention to the lack of a consistent appointment system; he intervened to save the Church Training College in Chester from threatened closure; strengthened the financial administration of the diocese; and campaigned for financial support of church schools, overseas missions and the widows of clergy. He was at the forefront of the Industrial Christian Fellowship Mission, and his commitment often took him to the slums of Birkenhead. In Webster&#x27;s summary, &quot;He was a confident bishop, never doubting the natural and pastoral role of the established church or experiencing the post-1900 questionings in philosophy and theology. He had no hesitations over his own faith&quot;.

===Bishop of London===
In 1939, Arthur Winnington-Ingram, the long-serving Bishop of London, retired at the age of 81. During his 38-year tenure, the diocese was riven by factions and came close to disintegrating. It was clear that Winnington-Ingram&#x27;s successor must be a man with a strong hand; Fisher was seen as one such, and Lang favoured his appointment. But although Fisher&#x27;s record as an organiser and disciplinarian was well known, his theological views were not, and the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, sought reassurance from Lang that Fisher was doctrinally sound. The archbishop told Chamberlain that Fisher was &quot;undoubtedly a man of deep personal religion. His piety is that of the best type of English layman ... he is very shy and humble about it (very English)&quot;. Chamberlain was reassured, and recommended to George VI that Fisher should succeed Winnington-Ingram. The King approved the appointment, but Fisher hesitated when offered it. He saw the great difficulties the turbulent diocese presented, and doubted his ability to unite it. After much private prayer, and reassurance from colleagues, he accepted and was enthroned as Bishop of London in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in November 1939.

The Second World War had broken out shortly before Fisher took up his London post, and from September 1940 the city suffered nightly bombing. Twenty-three Wren City churches were bombed by 1941, some beyond repair. Urgent action was needed to deal with devastated parishes. Fisher took the lead in the church assembly and in the House of Lords and the resulting measure was largely his work. Webster writes that Fisher showed courtesy, skill, and determination in &quot;defeating ultra-conservative attitudes which would have prevented any episcopal intervention even in severely blitzed areas&quot;.

Fisher, in the words of &quot;The Times&quot;, went about his duties &quot;with a calm diligence which won general respect&quot; and returned each night to sleep in the cellar at Fulham Palace. The war and the leadership of Temple – who succeeded Lang at Canterbury in 1942 – had begun to improve relations between the various Christian churches – Anglican, Roman Catholic and noncomformist. Though firmly Protestant in his views Fisher strongly supported this and acted as chairman of the joint committee in which the Anglican and Free Church &quot;Religion and Life&quot; movement cooperated with the Roman Catholic &quot;Sword of the Spirit&quot; led by Cardinal Hinsley, in the cause of &quot;moral regeneration and social reform&quot;. Fisher was frustrated by the refusal of some Roman Catholics to say even the Lord&#x27;s Prayer with Protestants. Hinsley&#x27;s death in 1943 was another blow to inter-church co-operation; his successor was opposed to it. Another only partial success for Fisher was his attempt to regulate the variety of forms of worship in London churches. The diocese had a tradition of High Church ritualism, and clerical dissent from the provisions of the Book of Common Prayer. Fisher sought to pursue the principle of apostolic authority to bring all parishes in the diocese back into conformity, but the matter was not resolved when he ceased to be Bishop of London in 1945.

===Archbishop of Canterbury===

In October 1944 Archbishop Temple died suddenly. Cyril Garbett, the Archbishop of York, was nearly 70 and declined to succeed him at Canterbury. Many in the church hoped that the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, would appoint another reform-minded idealist such as George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester, but Churchill chose Fisher. Temple had hoped Fisher would be his successor, valuing his precision and administrative skill. Garbett, too, approved; he and Fisher were close personal friends. In his view Canterbury needed &quot;a dynamic presence for some years, not a caretaker&quot;, and he welcomed working with Fisher. Nonetheless, after Churchill lost the 1945 general election, the Church was left, in Webster&#x27;s words, with &quot;a reforming Labour government&quot; but &quot;a conservative, headmasterly archbishop who, though warm-hearted, was determined to maintain the protestant establishment&quot;. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Garbett and Fisher cooperated in the government of the Church in an unusually close manner made possible by strong mutual regard. &quot;Garbett had a wider knowledge of social matters and was more at home than Fisher in the disputed territory which lies between religion and politics. Fisher was happy to have his hands free for the task of refurbishing the administrative structure of the Church&quot;. His obituarist in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;It was a grim and testing moment for any man to take up the highest position in the whole of the Anglican communion. He at once rose to it, partly by his clear self-knowledge that he was no Temple and must never try to become one.&quot;

====Canon law====
Fisher put considerable effort into revising the Church of England&#x27;s canon law. The canons of 1604 were still nominally in force, despite being substantially out of date. His efforts provoked bitter controversy. In 1946 he preached a university sermon at Cambridge on the theme that communion between the Church of England and the Free Churches was possible and should be pursued. His enthusiastic support for the World Council of Churches and his blessing of the new Church of South India, an Anglican and Free Church coalition, were viewed with hostility by some Anglo-Catholics. They suspected Fisher of fostering pan-Protestantism, and the force with which he criticised the exclusiveness of the Church of Rome added to their resistance. They regarded his detailed and painstaking revision of canon law with similar suspicion. &quot;The Times&quot; summed up:
Fisher also met resistance from liberals in the church, who regarded his canon law reforms as unduly bureaucratic and calculated to institute a regime of &quot;prosecutions and petty persecutions&quot;. The reforms were eventually accepted, but it took many years: they were not formally adopted until 1969, under Fisher&#x27;s successor, Michael Ramsey.

====Marriages, coronation and divorces====

Fisher officiated at the marriage of Princess Elizabeth in Westminster Abbey in 1947, and after her accession to the throne he led the coronation service in 1953, and crowned her as queen. Shortly afterwards he was drawn into a controversy when the Queen&#x27;s younger sister, Princess Margaret, was romantically linked with Peter Townsend, a divorced man. The Church of England regarded marriage as a lifelong commitment and divorcés or divorcées could not remarry in church. The princess decided not to marry Townsend, and although she stated that her decision had been made &quot;entirely alone&quot;, mindful of the Church&#x27;s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage, it was rumoured that Fisher had influenced her in taking a course widely regretted among the British public. The Prime Minister&#x27;s son, Randolph Churchill, commented that the rumour &quot;has done incalculable harm to the Church of England&quot;.

One of Fisher&#x27;s aims during his 16 years as archbishop was to make the position of the Church about the marriage of divorced people widely understood and accepted. He staunchly upheld the rules that would have prevented Princess Margaret and Townsend from marrying in church, but in the words of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he &quot;combin[ed] that undoubted rigour with a profound compassion for all those whose lives had been ... wrecked by a disastrous marriage. That road lay over a knife-edge of perplexity and contradiction, but he trod it creatively.&quot;

====Church unity and administration====
For Fisher, the most important initiative of his archiepiscopate was to advance the cause of Christian unity. Strengthening ties did not necessarily mean converging theologically. To Fisher, better relations grew out of free communication and mutual respect. In his speech at Cambridge in 1946 he urged full communion between the episcopal and non-episcopal churches, in which there were no barriers to exchanges of ministers and ministries. His efforts led to the prospect of union with the Methodists, and his visit to Rome in 1960 to meet Pope John XXIII. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Fisher was received in the Vatican &quot;not as a bishop on pilgrimage but as the Father in God of the entire Anglican Communion&quot;; the visit marked the end of centuries of hostility between Canterbury and Rome. Parallel with his quest for inter-church Christian unity was Fisher&#x27;s concern to strengthen the community between the various international Churches within the Anglican Communion. Partly because of the enforced separation caused by the Second World War, worldwide Anglican ties had become weak. Fisher began in 1946 with a visit to Canada and the United States, during which he established or strengthened links between the English and the North American episcopates. After that he travelled continually to almost every part of the Anglican Communion, establishing that principle that &quot;an Archbishop of Canterbury must be peripatetic&quot; globally. He arranged for the Anglican Communion to have a chief executive officer, the first of whom was Bishop Stephen Bayne of the US.

As he had at Chester, as Archbishop of Canterbury Fisher concerned himself with modernising the administration of the Church. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;His incessant pleas to relieve the poverty of the clergy were heard, and it was in his time that the Church Commissioners shook themselves free from their old obligation to invest only in trustee securities – a stroke which relieved many a vicarage from grinding poverty&quot;.

====Later years as archbishop====

In 1956 Garbett, Fisher&#x27;s friend and confidant, retired; the new Archbishop of York was Michael Ramsey. He had been a pupil under Fisher at Repton, and in the words of a biographer, Fisher &quot;still played the headmaster&quot; to Ramsey even after he became an archbishop. Ramsey was described by &quot;The Times&quot; as &quot;a theologian in, but not quite of, the world of high-powered ecclesiastical committees&quot;. Without Garbett&#x27;s skill in political matters, Fisher began to make incautious and sometimes controversial pronouncements. Matters were exacerbated by his suspicion of the British press, and his dislike was frequently reciprocated, causing Fisher to receive hostile press coverage on occasion. He spoke frequently in the House of Lords. In 1957 he gave a cautious welcome to the Wolfenden report (1957) which advocated decriminalising homosexual practices, saying there was &quot;a realm which is not the law&#x27;s business; a sacred area of privacy where people make their own choices and decisions into which the law must not intrude&quot;. He also welcomed the decision of the Lambeth Conference in favour of family planning: &quot;It is utterly wrong to urge that unless children are specifically desired, sexual intercourse is of the nature of sin&quot;. He clashed with the Conservative governments of Anthony Eden and Harold Macmillan over the Suez crisis of 1956 and Macmillan&#x27;s introduction of premium bonds (which Fisher called &quot;squalid&quot;) and his assertion that Britain had &quot;never had it so good&quot;.

In 1958, at a time of heightened fear of nuclear war and mutual destruction between the West and the Soviet Union, Fisher said that he was &quot;convinced that it is never right to settle any policy simply out of fear of the consequences. For all I know it is within the providence of God that the human race should destroy itself in this manner.&quot; He was also quoted as saying, &quot;The very worst the Bomb can do is to sweep a vast number of people from this world into the next into which they must all go anyway&quot;. He was heavily criticised in the press for this view, but a number of clergy, including Christopher Chavasse, Bishop of Rochester, defended him, saying, &quot;In an evil world, war can be the lesser of the two evils.&quot;

Fisher tried to influence the choice of his successor. He preferred the evangelical Donald Coggan, Bishop of Bradford, to the more obvious choice, Ramsey. To Fisher, the latter was too much a party man – too closely allied with the Anglo-Catholic wing of the church. Macmillan, with whom Fisher got on least well of the four prime ministers with whom he had to deal during his time in office, was not swayed by his arguments. Several versions exist of the exchange between archbishop and premier, all to the effect that Fisher said that as Ramsey&#x27;s former headmaster he did not consider him suitable, to which Macmillan is said to have replied that Fisher may have been Ramsey&#x27;s headmaster but had never been his, and that he would make up his own mind. Fisher retired on 17 January 1961; Ramsey succeeded him.

===Retirement===
Fisher was made a life peer, with the title of Baron Fisher of Lambeth, of Lambeth in the County of London. He and his wife settled at Trent rectory, near Sherborne, in Dorset, where he served as an honorary assistant priest. Webster describes him as &quot;a warm-hearted country parson, getting to know everyone in the village and playing chess with some of the boys&quot;. In retirement he bombarded his successor with &quot;critical and sometimes harsh comments&quot; (Webster). Ramsey, though hurt, contented himself with observing, &quot;The trouble with Geoffrey is that he could not get episcopacy out of his system&quot;.

Fisher died on 15 September 1972 and was buried in the churchyard at Trent on 20 September. A memorial service, led by Ramsey, was held in Canterbury Cathedral on the same day as Fisher&#x27;s interment at Trent. Ramsey concluded his eulogy, &quot;Today Christians of every tradition, Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Anglican, Protestant, salute the memory of a leader and a friend&quot;. A memorial to Fisher was erected in the chapel of St Gregory in Canterbury Cathedral.

==Honours==
As well as being created a life peer, Fisher received the Royal Victorian Chain in 1949, and was made Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1953. He received honorary degrees from Cambridge, Columbia, Pennsylvania and Princeton (all 1946), London (1948), Manchester (1950), Edinburgh (1953), Yale (1954), British Columbia (1954), Northwestern University, Evanston (1954), General Theological Seminary, New York (1957), Trinity College, Dublin (1961), and Assumption University of Windsor, Ontario (1962). He was prelate of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (1946–1967). He was made a freeman of the cities of London and Canterbury (1952) and of Croydon (1961).

<text>Edward Leedskalnin () (January 12, 1887 – December 7, 1951) was a Latvian immigrant to the United States and self-taught engineer who single-handedly built the Coral Castle in Florida, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Leedskalnin was also known for developing theories of magnetism.

==Life==
Edward Leedskalnin was born on January 12, 1887, in Stāmeriena Parish, Latvia. He was the fifth son of Mina and Andrejs Liedskalniņš, who were farmers on rented land. It&#x27;s during his time in Latvia that it&#x27;s believed under the tutelage of his father that Leedskalnin learned stonemasonry. Little is known of his childhood, aside from the fact that his parents were not wealthy and he received only a fourth-grade formal education. Edward was a sickly boy who often spent time reading books, helping him to develop an inquisitive mind and lifelong yearning for knowledge. It was suggested that he learned stonemasonry from his father and practiced this craft in Latvia after coming of age.

At the age of 26 he was engaged to marry Agnes Skuvst who was ten years younger. However, the girl who Leedskalnin later referred to as his &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; broke their engagement. He then decided to emigrate to North America.

On April 7, 1912, Leedskalnin arrived in New York City. After looking for suitable work around the East Coast until August, he relocated to the Pacific Northwest, which was experiencing a logging boom. On June 5, 1917, while in Oregon he filled in his draft registration stating that he was self-employed and engaged in ax-handle manufacturing. The 1920 census data reveal that he resided in Reedsport, Oregon.

In the winter of 1922–1923, after allegedly contracting tuberculosis, Leedskalnin moved to the warmer climate of Florida, where he purchased an undeveloped parcel of land in Florida City, which at the time was lightly inhabited. On February 27, 1923 &quot;The Homestead Enterprise&quot; newspaper published a notice that &quot;E. Leedskalnin a Californian has purchased an acre of the R. L. Moser homestead and is planning to erect a home soon.&quot;

Over the next 20 years, Leedskalnin constructed a massive structure that he called &quot;Rock Gate&quot; and dedicated, in his own words, to the girl who had left him years before. Working alone and mostly at night, Leedskalnin eventually quarried and sculpted more than 1,100 short tons (997,903 kg) of oolite limestone into an architectural and engineering landmark that would later be known as the Coral Castle. He used various basic tools available under his modest means including salvaged timber and old automobile parts. First, he built a house out of limestone blocks and wood, then he gradually constructed the stone structure for which he is now famous. With a reserved personality, he eventually opened the Coral Castle to the public, offering tours for 10 cents.

When people were asking Leedskalnin how he had moved all of the heavy stone on his own, he usually replied, &quot;I understand the laws of weight and leverage and I know the secrets of the people who built the pyramids&quot;, referring to the Great Pyramid of Giza. Some local residents later remembered that as school children they had field trips to the construction site of the future Coral Castle, and Leedskalnin personally explained manual methods of his work.

In the 1920s, the structure with an assortment of sculpted stones was located in Florida City; then, in the mid-1930s, Leedskalnin hired a truck with a driver to move it to its present location on a site in the adjacent Homestead, Florida. Leedskalnin was an eccentric and lived on an exclusive diet of only crackers and sardines. In his later years, he starved himself. On November 9, 1951, he checked himself into Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. Apparently, Leedskalnin suffered a stroke either before he left for the hospital or at the hospital. He died twenty-eight days later of pyelonephritis (kidney infection) at the age of 64. His death certificate noted that his death was a result of &quot;uremia; failure of kidneys, as a result of the infection and abscess.&quot;

==Publications==
Leedskalnin published five pamphlets on various subjects, advertising them in local newspapers.

&quot;Magnetic Current&quot; was first published in 1988 and the only source for any of these pamphlets is the Coral Castle gift shop.

===Moral education===
His first and longest booklet, a treatise on moral education, is printed on only the left-hand pages, and begins with the following preface:

In the first section, Leedskalnin argues that girls should be kept pure, and that boys are primarily a soiling influence upon them. On page 4 of &quot;A Book in Every Home&quot;, Leedskalnin writes:

The second section continues along the theme of moral education, with several aphorisms aimed at parents regarding the proper way to raise children. The last, &quot;Political&quot; section, reveals that the reclusive Leedskalnin had strong political views. He advocates voting for property owners only (and in proportion to their holdings), and argues that &quot;Anyone who is too weak to make his own living is not strong enough to vote.&quot;

Some writers have suggested that Leedskalnin&#x27;s booklet contains further information on his electromagnetic research and philosophies encoded in its pages, and the blank pages are provided for the reader to fill in their decrypted solutions. It has also been suggested that Leedskalnin&#x27;s frequent referral to his &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; may in fact refer to the numerological and/or scientific relevance of the number sixteen to his research and theories.

He wrote that a mother&#x27;s most important task is to ensure that her daughter remains &quot;chaste and faithful&quot;:

===Magnetism===
Leedskalnin became interested in the general theory of magnetism. His four pamphlets addressed interaction of electricity, magnetism and the body; Leedskalnin also included a number of simple experiments to validate his theories.

Contradicting the standard model of electromagnetism, but remarkably in line with the concept of &#x27;magnetic moment&#x27; / &#x27;electron spin theory&#x27;, his thesis is based upon the theory that the metal itself is not the magnet and that the real magnets are circulating in the metal. These individual north and south pole magnets are particles smaller than atoms or photons and each particle in the substance was an individual magnet by itself.

Leedskalnin claimed that all matter was being acted upon by what he called &quot;individual magnets&quot;. He also claimed that scientists of his time were looking in the wrong place for their understanding of electricity and that they were observing only &quot;one half of the whole concept&quot; with &quot;one sided tools of measurement&quot;

==In popular culture==
Ed Leedskalnin and his megalithic creation of Coral Castle became a part of the American popular culture due to the magnitude of a single man&#x27;s effort and ingenuity. Some conjectured that he used esoteric ancient knowledge to levitate blocks of stone and move them with the aid of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic energy. Other explanations center on Leedskalnin&#x27;s stonemasonry and logging experiences that allowed him to apply his work skills to a tedious process of moving large blocks of stone using levers, wheels, axles, pulleys, ramps, and wedges without any electrical equipment.

The emotional side of Ed Leedskalnin&#x27;s life story drew the attention of authors, songwriters and performers, including:
* Billy Idol recorded the song &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; for his &quot;Whiplash Smile&quot; album. It was based on the love story of Leedskalnin and his runaway girl. The music video was recorded at Coral Castle in 1986.
* The Brooklyn-based band Piñataland recorded a song about Leedskalnin, titled &quot;Latvian Bride&quot;, for their 2003 album &quot;Songs for the Forgotten Future Vol. 1&quot;.
* Andrew Peterson recorded a song, &quot;The Coral Castle&quot;, in his &quot;Carried Along&quot; (2002) studio album that evoked Leedskalnin&#x27;s &quot;broken heart&quot; story.
* Cuban-American author Daína Chaviano, dedicated a whole chapter (&quot;Very close to my heart&quot;) from her novel &quot;The Island of Eternal Love&quot; to the history of Coral Castle and his builder Edward Leedskalnin

<text>The Porsche 930 is a turbocharged variant of the 911 model sports car manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche between 1975 and 1989. It was the maker&#x27;s top-of-the-range 911 model for its entire production duration and, at the time of its introduction, was the fastest production car available in Germany.

==Model history==
Porsche began experimenting with turbocharging technology on their race cars during the late 1960s, and in 1972 began development on a turbocharged version of the 911. Porsche originally needed to produce the car in order to comply with homologation regulations and had intended on marketing it as a street legal race vehicle like the 1973 Carrera 2.7 RS. The FIA&#x27;s Appendix &quot;J” rules upon which the 911 Turbo Carrera RSR 2.1 was entered into competition in 1974 changed in 1975 and 1976. The FIA announced that cars for Group 4 and Group 5 had to be production cars and be available for sale to individual purchasers through manufacturer dealer networks. For the 1976 season, new FIA regulations required manufacturers to produce 400 cars within a twenty-four-month period to gain approval for Group 4. Group 5 would require the car to be derived from a homologated model in Group 3 or 4. Porsche&#x27;s Group 4 entry was the 934, homologated on 6 December 1975. For Group 5, Porsche would develop one of the most successful racing cars of the time, the 935. The 911 Turbo was put into production in 1975. While the original purpose of the 911 Turbo was to gain homologation for the 1976 racing season, it quickly became popular among car enthusiasts. Four hundred cars were produced by the end of 1975. Since Porsche wanted to compete in the 1976 season, they gained FIA homologation for the Porsche Turbo for Group 4 in Nr. 645 on 6 December 1975 and the 1,000th 911 Turbo was completed on 5 May 1976.
Ferry Porsche gave the first Turbo model to his sister Louise Piëch for her 70th birthday. Although this 911 Turbo No. 1 already has the large rear spoiler of the later production model, it still has the narrower bodywork of the Carrera, whose lettering at the rear has not been removed. In addition, the 911 Turbo No. 1 has only a turbocharged 2.7-liter boxer engine with 177 kW (240 hp) instead of the 3.0-liter boxer engine installed later.

Ernst Fuhrmann adapted the turbo-technology originally developed for the 917/30 CAN-AM car and applied it to the 3.0 litre flat-six used in Carrera RS 3.0, thus creating what Porsche internally dubbed as the 930. The car utilises a single KK&amp;K turbocharger.

Total power output from the engine was at 5,500 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm, much more than the standard Carrera it was based on. The engine has a compression ratio of 6.5:1. In order to ensure that the platform could make the most of the higher power output, a revised suspension, larger brakes and a stronger gearbox became part of the package, although some consumers were unhappy with Porsche&#x27;s use of a four-speed transmission whilst a five-speed manual transmission was available in the &quot;lower trim&quot; Carrera. A &quot;whale tail&quot; rear spoiler was installed to help vent more air to the engine and to create more downforce at the rear of the vehicle, and wider rear wheels with upgraded tires combined with flared wheel arches were implemented in order to increase the car&#x27;s width and grip, making it more stable.


Porsche badged the vehicle simply as &quot;Turbo&quot; (although early U.S. units were badged as &quot;Turbo Carrera&quot;) and introduced the vehicle at the Paris Auto Show in October 1974 before putting it on sale in the spring of 1975; export to the United States began in 1976.

The 930 proved very fast but also very demanding to drive, and due to its short wheelbase and rear engine layout, was prone to oversteer and turbo-lag. It acquired the nickname &quot;the Widowmaker&quot; after several crashes and deaths attributed to its handling characteristics, which were unfamiliar to many drivers. Under certain conditions, applying too much throttle would cause the heavy rear end of the car to swing outward like a pendulum, causing the car to spin out. To this day, Porsche corporate employees who drive 911 Turbo models for testing or for business reasons are mandated to undergo &quot;Turbo Training&quot;, despite the fact that newer 911 Turbo models are generally safer and easier to drive. 

Porsche made its first and most significant changes to the 930 for 1978 model year, enlarging the engine bore by to a total displacement of and adding an air-to-air intercooler. By cooling the pressurised air charge, the intercooler helped increase power output to at 5,500 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm (DIN); the rear &#x27;whale tail&#x27; spoiler was re-profiled and raised slightly to make room for the intercooler and the spoiler was now infamously called the &#x27;tea tray&#x27; spoiler by the enthusiasts. The suspension benefitted from new anti-roll bars, firmer shock absorbers and larger diameter rear torsion bars. Porsche also upgraded the brakes to units similar to those used on the 917 race car. While the increase in displacement and addition of an intercooler increased power output and torque, these changes also increased the weight of the vehicle, especially the engine, which contributed to a substantial change in the handling and character of the car compared to the earlier 3.0-litre models.

Changing emissions regulations in Japan and the United States forced Porsche to withdraw the 930 from those markets in 1980. It however remained available in Canada. Envisioning the luxurious 928 gran turismo eventually replacing the 911 as the top of the Porsche model lineup, Fuhrmann cut back further development on the model, and it was not until his resignation that the company finally committed the financing to update the car&#x27;s emissions systems, and recertify the 930 for sale in all markets.

The 930 remained available in Europe, and for 1983 a at 5750 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm performance option became available on a build-to-order basis from Porsche. With the so-called &quot;Werksleistungssteigerung&quot; (WLS, &quot;Works Performance Increase&quot;) add-on came a quad-pipe exhaust system and an additional oil-cooler requiring a remodelled front spoiler and units bearing the add-on often featured additional ventilation holes in the rear fenders and modified rockers.

By the 1985 model year, 928 sales had risen slightly, but the question remained as to whether it would supersede the 911 as the company&#x27;s premier model. Porsche reintroduced the 930 to the Japanese and U.S. markets in 1986 with an emission-controlled engine having a power output of at 5500 rpm and at 4000 rpm of torque. At the same time Porsche introduced targa and cabriolet variants, both of which proved popular.

Porsche discontinued the 930 after the 1989 model year when its underlying &quot;G-Series&quot; platform was being replaced by the 964. The 1989 models were the first and last versions of the 930 to feature the Getrag G50 five-speed manual transmission. A turbocharged variant of the 964 officially succeeded the 930 in 1991 with a modified version of the same 3.3-litre flat-six engine and a five-speed transmission.

=== Flatnose (Slantnose 930S)===
Kremer Racing had originally begun offering conversion kits for 930 Turbo models which included front bodywork like the famous 935 race car in 1981. In 1982, TAG Heuer co-owner Mansour Ojjeh commissioned Porsche to develop a road-legal version of the 935 race car. The final product was developed using a body shell of the 930 and fitting fabricated 935 body panels to it. The one-off also had the suspension and brakes shared with the 935 race car. Other special features of the car included special paintwork called Brilliant Red by the manufacturer, BBS wheels and the use of the 3.3-litre turbocharged flat-6 engine of the 934 race car. The car proved very popular among enthusiasts and prospective buyers began to demand a similar car as a factory offering. Porsche offered a &quot;Flachbau&quot; (&quot;flatnose&quot; or &quot;slantnose&quot;) 930 under the &quot;Sonderwunschprogramm&quot; (special order program) from 1986 model year, an otherwise normal 930 with a 935-style slantnose instead of the normal 911 front end with the replacement of the famous &quot;bug eye&quot; headlamps with pop-up units.

Each &quot;Flachbau&quot; unit was handcrafted by remodeling the front fenders (option code M505 for the US and M506 elsewhere). A limited number of units were produced due to the fact that the package commanded a high premium price, an initial premium of up to 60 per cent (highly individualised cars requiring even more) over the standard price. 948 units were built in total with 160 of them being imported to the US. The Flachbau units delivered in Europe usually featured the WLS performance kit. The flat nose greatly contributed to the aerodynamics of the car and enabled it to accelerate from 0–97 km/h in 4.85 seconds and attain a top speed of (figures with the performance kit).

== Independently tested performance data ==


&quot;Car and Driver&quot; recorded a 0–60 mph acceleration time of 4.9 seconds for both the 1975 and 1978 Porsche 911 Turbo, they shared first place in the magazine&#x27;s &quot;quickest cars of the 1970s&quot; ranking with a 0.4-second lead.

== TAG Turbo ==

In the 1980s, Porsche built twin-turbocharged 1.5-litre V6 engines for the McLaren Formula One team. The engine was given the code &quot;TTE P01&quot; and was fitted in the McLaren MP4/2 and MP4/3 generating depending on track conditions.
The engine was financed by Luxembourgian holdings company Techniques d&#x27;Avant Garde (TAG), leading to the engine being branded as the TAG Turbo. A Porsche 930 Turbo was used as a test mule by McLaren in order to test the engine&#x27;s capability. The car was exterior-wise similar to the standard 930 Turbo but featured RUF sourced wheels instead of the standard Fuchs units, a taller whale tail rear spoiler in order to accommodate a large pair of intercoolers and a new front bumper. The changes to the interior consisted of racing bucket seats and a new TAG branded tachometer with a 10,000 rpm redline. 

In September 2018, English automotive company Lanzante introduced a new model based on the same principle at the RennSport Reunion VI. The company obtained permission from McLaren to produce the model and bought 11 of those engines originally installed in the F1 cars for this purpose from the manufacturer. Cosworth is tasked to restore the engines. Each of the 11 cars fitted with the engines would come with a plaque signifying the engine&#x27;s race history, engine number and the car&#x27;s production number. The Lanzante display car&#x27;s engine was originally fitted in 1984 to Niki Lauda&#x27;s MP4/2 in which he won the British GP.

<text>Arthur Michael Ramsey, Baron Ramsey of Canterbury, (14 November 1904 – 23 April 1988) was a British Church of England bishop and life peer. He served as the 100th Archbishop of Canterbury. He was appointed on 31 May 1961 and held the office until 1974, having previously been appointed Bishop of Durham in 1952 and the Archbishop of York in 1956.

He was known as a theologian, educator, and advocate of Christian unity.

==Early life==
Ramsey was born in Cambridge, England in 1904. His parents were Arthur Stanley Ramsey (1867–1954) and Mary Agnes Ramsey née Wilson (1875–1927); his father was a Congregationalist and mathematician and his mother was a socialist and suffragist. He was educated at Sandroyd School, Wiltshire, King&#x27;s College School, Cambridge, Repton School (where the headmaster was a future Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Francis Fisher) and Magdalene College, Cambridge, where his father was president of the college. At university he was president of the Cambridge Union Society and his support for the Liberal Party won him praise from H. H. Asquith.

Ramsey&#x27;s elder brother, Frank P. Ramsey (1903–1930), was a mathematician and philosopher (of atheist convictions). He was something of a prodigy who, when only 19, translated Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus&quot; into English.

During his time in Cambridge, Ramsey came under the influence of the Anglo-Catholic dean of Corpus Christi College, Edwyn Clement Hoskyns. On the advice of Eric Milner-White he trained at Cuddesdon, where he became friends with Austin Farrer and was introduced to Orthodox Christian ideas by Derwas Chitty. He graduated in 1927 with a First-class degree in Theology.

==Ordained ministry==
Ramsey was ordained in 1928 and became a curate in Liverpool, where he was influenced by Charles Raven.

After this he became a lecturer to ordination candidates at the Bishop&#x27;s Hostel in Lincoln. During this time he published a book, &quot;The Gospel and the Catholic Church&quot; (1936). He then ministered at St Botolph&#x27;s Church, Boston and at St Bene&#x27;t&#x27;s Church, Cambridge, before being offered a canonry at Durham Cathedral and the Van Mildert Chair of Divinity in the Department of Theology at Durham University. After this, in 1950, he became the Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, but left to become a bishop after only a short time in office.

Ramsey married Joan A. C. Hamilton (1910–1995) at Durham in the early summer of 1942.

===Episcopal ministry===
In 1952, he was appointed Bishop of Durham. He was consecrated a bishop by Cyril Garbett, Archbishop of York, at York Minster on Michaelmas (29 September) that year (by which his election to the See of Durham must have already been confirmed). In 1956 he became Archbishop of York and, in 1961, Archbishop of Canterbury. During his time as archbishop he travelled widely and saw the creation of the General Synod. Retirement ages for clergy were cut from 75 to 70.

==Theology and churchmanship==

In a lecture on Ramsey, John Macquarrie asked, &quot;what kind of theologian was he?&quot; and answered that &quot;he was thoroughly Anglican&quot;. Macquarrie explained that Ramsey&#x27;s theology is (1) &quot;based on the scriptures&quot;, (2) the church&#x27;s &quot;tradition&quot;, and (3) &quot;reason and conscience&quot;. Ramsey held to the Anglo-Catholic tradition, but he appreciated other points of view. This was especially true after he became a bishop who ministered to diverse Anglicans.

As an Anglo-Catholic with a nonconformist background, Ramsey had a broad religious outlook. He had a particular regard for the Eastern Orthodox concept of &quot;glory&quot;, and his favourite book he had written was his 1949 work &quot;The Transfiguration&quot;.

Ramsey&#x27;s first reaction to J. A. T. Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Honest to God&quot; (1963) was hostile. However, he soon published a short response entitled &quot;Image Old and New&quot;, in which he engaged seriously with Robinson&#x27;s ideas.

Conscious always of the atheism which his short-lived brother Frank had espoused, he maintained a lifelong respect for honest unbelief, and considered that such unbelief would not automatically be a barrier to salvation. Acting on his respect for beliefs other than his, Ramsey made a barefoot visit to the grave of Mahatma Gandhi.

Although he disagreed with a lot of Karl Barth&#x27;s thinking, his relations with him were warm.

Following observations of a religious mission at Cambridge, he had an early dislike of evangelists and mass rallies, which he feared relied too much on emotion. This led him to be critical of Billy Graham, although the two later became friends and Ramsey even took to the stage at a Graham rally in Rio de Janeiro. One of his later books, &quot;The Charismatic Christ&quot; (1973), engaged with the charismatic movement.

Ramsey believed there was no decisive theological argument against women priests, although he was not entirely comfortable with this development. The first women priests in the Anglican Communion were ordained during his time as Archbishop of Canterbury. In retirement he received communion from a woman priest in the United States.

==Ecumenical activities==
Ramsey was active in the ecumenical movement, and while Archbishop of Canterbury in 1966 he met Pope Paul VI in Rome, where the Pope presented him with the episcopal (bishop&#x27;s) ring he had worn as Archbishop of Milan. The two prelates issued &quot;The Common Declaration by Pope Paul VI and the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Michael Ramsey&quot;. In it they said that their meeting &quot;marks a new stage in the development of fraternal relations, based upon Christian charity, and of sincere efforts to remove the causes of conflict and to re-establish unity.&quot;

Ramsey preached at the Roman Catholic St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City in 1972. It was the first time that a leader of the Anglican Communion had done so. However, while fostering ties with the Roman Catholic Church, Ramsey criticised the Pope&#x27;s 1968 encyclical &quot;Humanae Vitae&quot; against birth control.

These warm relations with Rome caused Ramsey to be dogged by protests by fundamentalist Protestants, particularly Ian Paisley.

Ramsey encouraged efforts to promote closer relations between Anglicans and Orthodox. He enjoyed friendship with the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople, Athenagoras, and Alexius, Patriarch of Moscow.

As Archbishop of Canterbury, Ramsey served as president of the World Council of Churches (1961–68). However, he opposed the granting of aid money by the World Council of Churches to guerrilla groups.

Ramsey&#x27;s willingness to talk to officially sanctioned churches in the Eastern Bloc led to criticisms from Richard Wurmbrand.

He also supported efforts to unite the Church of England with the Methodist Church and was disappointed when the plans fell through.

==Politics==

Before entering the clergy, Michael Ramsey had participated in the Liberal Party. In 1925, Ramsey travelled with the debate club and spoke at multiple venues in the United States. Upon his return, he heard Lord Hugh Cecil remark that the Church was the place to go for those who wanted to help people, and Ramsey heard that as his vocation from God. He had sympathies with liberal politics for the rest of his life and admired H. H. Asquith. He became close friends with party leader Jeremy Thorpe. Ramsey and his wife Joan were godparents of Thorpe&#x27;s son Rupert, whom Ramsey baptized in 1969, and Ramsey officiated at Thorpe&#x27;s second marriage to Marion Stein. Both Ramsey and Thorpe had lost family members to car collisions: Ramsey&#x27;s mother in 1927 and Thorpe&#x27;s first wife Caroline in 1970.

Ramsey disliked the power of the government over the church. &quot;Establishment has never been one of my enthusiasms,&quot; he said, and &quot;he was not at ease with the royal family.&quot; He supported the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the 1960s, which brought him enemies in the House of Lords.

In 1965, &quot;he outraged right-wingers when he declared that under certain circumstances, there would be Christian justice in using British troops to overthrow the white-minority regime [of Ian Smith] in Rhodesia.&quot; He also called the Vietnam War a &quot;futility&quot;. Regarding Africa, Ramsey opposed curbs on immigration to the UK of Kenyan Asians, which he saw as a betrayal by Britain of a promise. He was against apartheid, and he left an account of a very frosty encounter with John Vorster. In 1970, Ramsey attacked apartheid, saying that it was &quot;being increased by more ruthless actions” and describing it as an &quot;abuse of power at the expense of others&quot;. He was also a critic of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.

==Later life==

After retiring as Archbishop of Canterbury on 15 November 1974 he was created a life peer, as Baron Ramsey of Canterbury, of Canterbury in Kent, enabling him to remain in the House of Lords where he had previously sat as one of the Lords Spiritual.

Although retired, Ramsey remained active, &quot;a fact reflected in his writing of four books and numerous additional undertakings&quot;.

He went to live first at Cuddesdon, where he did not settle particularly well, and then for a number of years back in Durham, where he was regularly seen slowly making his way through the cathedral, and talking to students. A benevolent and popular figure, he occasionally participated in services there, notably giving an address at the 1984 dedication of the Marks &amp; Spencer financed Daily Bread window, on the topic of St Michael. However, Durham&#x27;s hills were rather steep for him and he and Lady Ramsey accepted the offer of a flat at Bishopthorpe in York by then archbishop John Habgood. They stayed there just over a year, moving finally to St John&#x27;s Home, attached to the All Saints&#x27; Sisters in Cowley, Oxford, where he died in April 1988.

During his retirement, he also spent several terms at Nashotah House, an Anglo-Catholic seminary of the Episcopal Church in Wisconsin where he was much beloved by students. A first-floor flat was designated &quot;Lambeth West&quot; for his personal use. A stained-glass window in the Chapel, bears his image and the same inscription as is on the memorial near his grave. The window (placed in the chapel by the class of 1976 who were among his first students at Nashotah) also includes a miniature image of the Bishop and his wife Joan. Ramsey Hall at Nashotah House was named in his honor, and is a residence for students and families. The Board of Directors of Nashotah House also presents, from time to time, the Michael Ramsey award for distinguished mission or ecumenical service in the Anglican Communion. 

Ramsey&#x27;s funeral was held in Canterbury Cathedral on 3 May. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the cloister garden at the cathedral, not far from the grave of William Temple. His wife&#x27;s ashes were also buried there. On the memorial stone are inscribed words from St Irenaeus: &quot;The Glory of God is the living man; And the life of man is the vision of God.&quot; A side chapel at Canterbury Cathedral was subsequently dedicated to Ramsey&#x27;s memory, situated next to a similar memorial chapel to Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher. Ramsey had no children. Lady Ramsey died on 17 February 1995 and was buried alongside her husband.

==Honours==
Ramsey received numerous honours, he was an honorary fellow of Magdalene College and Selwyn College, Cambridge, and of Merton College, Keble College, and St Cross College, Oxford. He was made an honorary master of the bench, Inner Temple in 1962; was a trustee of the British Museum from 1963 to 1969; and made an honorary Fellow of the British Academy in 1983. He held honorary degrees from Durham, Leeds, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Hull, Manchester, London, Oxford, Kent, and Keele and from a number of overseas universities.”

==Legacy==
Dr Sam Brewitt-Taylor, a historian at Lincoln College, University of Oxford, holds that “there is much more historical and theoretical work to be done before Ramsey’s legacy can be properly ascertained.”

Ramsey&#x27;s name has been given to Ramsey House, a residence of St Chad&#x27;s College, University of Durham. He was a Fellow and Governor of the college (resident for a period) and he regularly worshipped and presided at the college&#x27;s daily Eucharist. A building is also named after him at Canterbury Christ Church University. A house at Tenison&#x27;s School is named in his honour. He also gave his name to the former Archbishop Michael Ramsey Technology College (from September 2007 St Michael and All Angels Church of England Academy) in Farmers&#x27; Road, Camberwell, South East London.

An annual Michael Ramsey Lecture on an appropriate theological topic is delivered at Little St Mary&#x27;s, Cambridge in early November.

Michael Ramsey Prize for theological writing launched in 2005 and awarded every three years.

==Items found in River Wear==
In October 2009 it was reported by Maev Kennedy that two divers had found a number of gold and silver items in the River Wear in Durham which were subsequently discovered to have come from Ramsey&#x27;s personal collection, including items presented to him from dignitaries around the world while he was Archbishop of Canterbury. It is unclear how they came to be in the river. The divers were licensed by the dean and chapter of the cathedral as the owners of the land around the stretch of the river where the items were found. The current legal ownership of the items is yet to be determined. The cathedral was planning an exhibition relating to Ramsey&#x27;s life in 2010 and a new stained-glass window dedicated to him by artist Tom Denny.

The two amateur divers, brothers Gary and Trevor Bankhead, found a total of 32 religious artefacts in the River Wear in Durham during a full underwater survey of the area around Prebends Bridge. The underwater survey commenced in April 2007 and took two and half years to complete. The finds were individually handed over to the resident archaeologist from Durham Cathedral to formally record where and when they were found.

<doc id="561479" wikidata="Q2424692" url="?curid=561479" title="Tom Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill">
<text>Thomas Henry Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill (13 October 193311 September 2010) was a British judge who was successively Master of the Rolls, Lord Chief Justice and Senior Law Lord. On his death in 2010, he was described as the greatest judge of his generation. Baroness Hale of Richmond observed that his pioneering role in the formation of the United Kingdom Supreme Court may be his most important and long-lasting legacy. The Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers regarded Bingham as &quot;one of the two great legal figures of my lifetime in the law&quot; (the other figure, in context, being Lord Denning). Lord Hope of Craighead described Bingham as &quot;the greatest jurist of our time&quot;.

After retiring from the judiciary in 2008, Bingham focused on teaching, writing, and lecturing on legal subjects, particularly the law of human rights. His book, &quot;The Rule of Law&quot;, was published in 2010 and he was posthumously awarded the 2011 Orwell Prize for literature. The British Institute of International and Comparative Law named the &quot;Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law&quot; in his honour.

==Early life==
Bingham was born at Marylebone in London. His parents, Thomas Henry (1901–1981) and Catherine Bingham (&quot;née&quot; Watterson; 1903–1989), practised as doctors in Reigate, Surrey. His father was born in Belfast, a kinsman of the Earls of Lucan; his mother was from California before being raised on the Isle of Man.

He was educated at The Hawthorns prep school at Bletchingley, Surrey, where he was Head Boy, and then from 1947 the Cumbrian public school Sedbergh School (Winder House), where he was described as the &quot;brightest boy in 100 years&quot;. He enjoyed history, took up fell-walking, and developed a strong attachment to the Church of England; he was a Head of House and a School Prefect. He won an open scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, first undertaking National Service from 1952 to 1954, as a second lieutenant in the Royal Ulster Rifles serving in Hong Kong. He enjoyed his time in the Army and considered pursuing a military career before opting to serve in the Territorial Army for the next five years.

He went up to Oxford in 1954 and initially read Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, but after two terms switched to History. He was awarded one of the first William Coolidge Pathfinder Awards&lt;ref name=&quot;balliol.ox.ac.uk/pathfinders-awards&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and spent the summer of 1955 in the US. He entered Gray&#x27;s Inn during his second year at Oxford, with a view to becoming a barrister. He was elected President of Balliol Junior Common Room in his third year. He won the Gibbs Prize for Modern History in 1957 and was awarded first-class honours in finals. He also tried, unsuccessfully, for fellowship by examination at All Souls College. After graduation, he read for the Bar as Eldon Law Scholar and achieved a Certificate of Honour, coming top of Bar finals in 1959.

In 1963 he married Elizabeth Loxley, a Somerville graduate whose great-uncle was Major Gerald Loxley, of the Loxley family of Northcott Court, Hertfordshire; they had one daughter Catherine Elizabeth (born 1965), known as Kate, and two sons Thomas Henry (Harry, born 1967) and Christopher Toby (Kit, born 1969). Kate has been married since 1992 to Jesse Norman, then a Conservative government minister.

In 1965 Bingham and his wife Elizabeth acquired a cottage at Cornhill, near Boughrood in Powys; he died there in 2010.

==Early career==
Bingham was called to the Bar by Gray&#x27;s Inn, and was a pupil barrister under Judge Owen Stable QC in the chambers of Leslie Scarman at 2 Crown Office Row, which later moved to Fountain Court Chambers: within a few months, he was invited to become a tenant at the chambers. He took silk in 1972, becoming Queen&#x27;s Counsel aged just 38 and the youngest that year, having served as Standing Counsel at the Department of Employment for four years from 1968. He was Counsel to the judicial inquiry into an explosion at a chemical plant at Flixborough in 1974 which killed 28 people. In 1977, when still at the Bar, he rose to public attention when he was appointed by the then-Foreign Secretary Dr. David Owen to head a public enquiry into alleged breaches of UN sanctions by oil companies in Rhodesia.

He was appointed a Recorder in 1975, and became a Bencher of Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1978. He was promoted to High Court Judge of the Queen’s Bench Division in April 1980, aged 46, and assigned to the Commercial Court, receiving the customary knighthood. He was further promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1986, joining the Privy Council. In 1991 he led a high-profile inquiry into the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).

==Senior judicial career==

Bingham succeeded Lord Donaldson as Master of the Rolls in 1992 and initiated significant reforms, including a move towards the replacement of certain oral hearings in major civil law cases. He was one of the first senior judges to give public support to incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into English law, which ultimately came about with the passing of the Human Rights Act 1998. Bingham was appointed Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales in 1996, following Lord Taylor. In England and Wales, he was the highest-ranking judge in regular courtroom service; he was personally responsible for adding &quot;and Wales&quot; to the title of the office.
He was created a life peer as Baron Bingham of Cornhill, of Boughrood in the County of Powys, on 4 June 1996. He continued as Lord Chief Justice until 2000 when he was appointed Senior Law Lord. This position had customarily been held by the longest-serving Law Lord. Bingham was followed in the office of Lord Chief Justice by Lord Woolf, who had succeeded him as Master of the Rolls in 1996.

Bingham was a strong advocate of divorcing the judicial branch of the House of Lords from its legislative functions by setting up a new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, which was accomplished under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. The title of the office he held was redesignated as &quot;President of the Supreme Court&quot; upon that court&#x27;s establishment in October 2009, after Bingham had retired in July 2008. He is understood to have been &quot;very sorry&quot; not to serve as its inaugural president.

Bingham oversaw an increasing workload of constitutional affairs after Scottish devolution, and human rights matters after the Human Rights Act came into force, and assembled the first nine-judge panels for important cases since 1910, including the &quot;Belmarsh Case&quot; in December 2004 which reviewed the regime for indefinite detention of foreign nationals suspected of involvement in terrorism who could not be deported due to the risk of torture in their home countries, holding that the regimes might breach the Human Rights Act.

Bingham was one of two Law Lords to dissent from the decision to overturn the High Court and Court of Appeal decisions to quash an Order-in-Council, dismissing all impediments to the rights of the Chagos Islanders to return home. Bingham also presided over various decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upholding the finding that death penalties in Belize, St Lucia, St Kitts and the Bahamas were unconstitutional.

==Honours==
Bingham was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Law &quot;honoris causa&quot; by the University of Oxford in 1994. From 2001 to 2008, Bingham held the office of High Steward of the University of Oxford, its second-highest office in the academic hierarchy, and in 2003 he came second to Chris Patten (now Lord Patten) in the election for Chancellor. Bingham served as the Visitor of Balliol College, Oxford, from 1986 to 2010.

As Master of the Rolls, Bingham served on the Advisory Council on Public Records, the Magna Carta Trust, and the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. He was a Trustee of the Pilgrim Trust for 15 years and an Honorary Fellow of the British Academy from 2003. In 2005, he was advanced from Knight Bachelor to the Garter, an honour in the personal gift of the Sovereign and seldom bestowed upon judges, being installed as a Knight Companion of the Garter with Lady Soames and Sir John Major. He also served as president and chairman of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law, which established in 2010 the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law in his honour.

On 16 November 2006, Bingham delivered the sixth annual Sir David Williams Lecture, hosted by the Centre for Public Law at the Faculty of Law of the University of Cambridge; this lecture was entitled &quot;The Rule of Law&quot;. On 17 January 2008, Bingham presented the annual Hansard Lecture at the University of Southampton. On 14 March 2008, Bingham received the degree of Doctor of Jurisprudence &quot;honoris causa&quot; from the University of Rome III, after delivering the &quot;Lectio Magistralis&quot; at the Faculty of Law entitled &quot;The Rule of Law&quot;.

In 2009, Bingham became involved with Reprieve, a UK charity, as well as delivering the fourth annual Jan Grodecki Lecture at the University of Leicester, entitled &quot;The House of Lords: Its Future&quot;.

==Retirement==
Bingham remained active in retirement. On 17 November 2008, in his first major speech since retiring as Senior Law Lord, Bingham, addressing the British Institute of International and Comparative Law, disputed the legality of the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries. He said that the invasion and occupation of Iraq was &quot;a serious violation of international law&quot;, and he accused Britain and the US of acting like a &quot;world vigilante&quot;.

In June 2009, Bingham was interviewed by the British legal journalist Joshua Rozenberg on the subject of the rule of law in international affairs, an event arranged to raise awareness of the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law at the British Institute of International and Comparative Law. Bingham&#x27;s thoughts on this subject, in particular banning of certain weapons in international conflict, were covered by various newspapers &quot;The Independent&quot; (&quot;Top judge: &quot;use of drones intolerable&quot;) and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; (&quot;Unmanned drones could be banned&quot;, says senior judge&quot;).
Bingham gave another interview concerning the rule of law and matters pertaining to the &quot;British Constitution&quot; with the charity, the Constitution Society.

His book, &quot;The Rule of Law&quot;, was published by Allen Lane in 2010; it won the 2011 Orwell Prize for Literature.

==Death==
Diagnosed with lung cancer in 2009 (he was a non-smoker), Bingham died the following year, and is buried at St Cynog&#x27;s Church at Boughrood in Powys, Wales. His memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on 25 May 2011 with the Adamant New Orleans Marching Band playing &quot;When the Saints Go Marching In&quot;.

==Publications==


==Legacy==
In 2010, shortly before Bingham died, the British Institute of International and Comparative Law established &quot;The Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law&quot;, a body solely dedicated to the promotion and enhancement of the rule of law worldwide.

In an interview on 7 February 2014, Nick Phillips, successor to Bingham as Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, remarked that &quot;...Tom Bingham was the most wonderful man; he was head and shoulders above everybody else in the Law, in my view...yes, just outstanding...his clarity of thought, his academic knowledge. I think almost everyone would say that he was, you know, the great lawyer of his generation.&quot;

<text>John Elmer Blaha (born August 26, 1942, in San Antonio, Texas) is a retired United States Air Force colonel and a former NASA astronaut. He is a veteran of five space missions aboard the Space Shuttle and Mir.

Blaha is married to the former Brenda I. Walters of St. Louis, Missouri. They have three children.

==Education==
Blaha graduated from Granby High School in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1960; received a Bachelor of Science in engineering science from the United States Air Force Academy in 1965; and received a Master of Science in astronautical engineering from Purdue University in 1966.

==Air Force service==
Blaha received his pilot wings at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, in 1967. He was subsequently assigned as an operational pilot flying F-4, F-102, F-106, and A-37 aircraft (completing 361 combat missions in Vietnam). He attended the USAF Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, in 1971, and piloted the NF-104 research aircraft to 104,400 feet. Following graduation, he served as an F-104 instructor pilot at the test pilot school, teaching low lift-to-drag approach, zoom, performance, stability/control, and spin flight test techniques. In 1973, he was assigned as a test pilot working with the Royal Air Force at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment, Boscombe Down, United Kingdom. During a three-year tour, he flew stability/control, performance, spin, and weapons delivery flight tests in the SEPECAT Jaguar, Blackburn Buccaneer, BAE Hawk, and BAC Jet Provost aircraft. In 1976, he attended the U.S. Air Force Air Command and Staff College. After graduation, he was assigned to work for the Assistant Chief of Staff, Studies and Analyses, at Headquarters USAF in the Pentagon. During this tour, he presented F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon study results to Department of Defense, State Department, and Congressional staffs.

==NASA==

Selected as an astronaut in May 1980, Blaha has logged 161 days in space on five space missions.

In addition to flying five space missions, Blaha has served as the chairman, NASA Space Flight Safety Panel; weather manager, Mission Management Team; lead spacecraft communicator; member, NASA Space Shuttle Improvement Panel. Blaha also led the design, development, and integration of the Orbiter Head Up Display system. Additionally, he led the development of contingency abort procedures which significantly improve crew survivability in the event of multiple main engine failures during ascent. He has logged more than 7,000 hours of flying time in 34 different aircraft, and has written numerous technical articles on spacecraft performance and control.

Blaha retired from NASA in September 1997 to return to his hometown of San Antonio, Texas, where he joined the executive management team of the United Services Automobile Association.

===Space flights===
====STS-29====

STS-29 was a NASA Space Shuttle mission using the &quot;Discovery&quot;. Launched on March 13, 1989, from the Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Launch Complex 39B, its main objective was the deployment of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-D). Blaha served as the pilot of the STS-29 mission, marking his first spaceflight. In this role, Blaha supported the commander during the launch, orbit, and landing procedures. Additionally, he was involved in on-orbit operations.

====STS-33====

STS-33 was a NASA Space Shuttle mission involving the &quot;Discovery&quot;. The shuttle was launched on November 23, 1989, from Launch Complex 39B. Blaha was chosen for this mission as a replacement for S. David Griggs, who died in an accident in June 1989. This marked the first crew substitution of its kind since the Apollo 13 mission. The &quot;Discovery&quot; completed its mission objectives and returned to Earth, landing on November 28, 1989, at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22.

====STS-43====

STS-43 was a shuttle mission aboard the &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The shuttle launched on August 2, 1991, from Launch Complex 39A. One of the primary objectives of the mission was the deployment of the fifth Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS-E. Blaha served as the commander, marking his third mission to space and his first as commander. In addition to the deployment of TDRS-E, the STS-43 crew conducted various secondary payloads and experiments, which contributed to advancements in a range of scientific fields. The &quot;Atlantis&quot; successfully concluded its mission by landing on August 11, 1991, at the Shuttle Landing Facility.

====STS-58====

STS-58 was a shuttle mission utilizing the &quot;Columbia&quot;. The shuttle launched on October 18, 1993, from Launch Complex 39B. Blaha served as the commander for this mission, marking his fourth journey to space. The mission&#x27;s emphasis was on biomedical studies under the Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS-2) program. This program involved a comprehensive set of experiments to study the physiological effects of prolonged spaceflight. With a duration of 14 days, 0 hours, 12 minutes, and 32 seconds, STS-58 became the longest mission of the Space Shuttle program. The &quot;Columbia&quot; completed its mission by landing on November 1, 1993, at 15:05:42 UTC at the Edwards Air Force Base, touching down on Runway 22.

====Mir====

Blaha began Russian language training in August 1994 at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, and commenced an intensive training program at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, Star City, Russia in January 1995. He launched on STS-79 on September 16, 1996. After docking he transferred to the Mir Space Station. Assigned as a Board Engineer 2, he spent the following 4 months with the Mir 22 Cosmonaut crew conducting material science, fluid science, and life science research. Blaha returned to Earth aboard STS-81 on January 22, 1997.

Blaha was not permitted to vote in the November 1996 election, because his mission on Mir began before ballots were finalized and lasted beyond Election Day. In 1997, Texas amended its election statutes to permit voting from space, as a result of his predicament.

<text>James Foster is the inventor of the game of Arena Football, (and US patent recipient), the founder and first commissioner of the Arena Football League (AFL).

He is also a former National Football League (NFL) and United States Football League (USFL) executive and was later the Managing Owner of both the Iowa Barnstormers and the AF2&#x27;s Quad City Steamwheelers.

==Biography==
Born and raised in Iowa City, Iowa, Foster graduated from the University of Iowa in 1972 with a BGS in advertising/marketing and broadcast journalism, (working on air for UIowa radio stations WSUI and KICR). At Iowa, Foster lettered in track/cross country while also being a member and officer in the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. He also served as the paid executive director of the overall 22 houses fraternity system at UIowa from 1970 to 1972 when he graduated.

In 1974 He founded, played and served as club director of the Newton Nite Hawks minor league football team of the Northern States AAA Pro Football League (NSFL). After winning the league championship in 1975, Foster worked with a well known European soccer coach and sports promoter Bob Kapp, to organize and introduce the sport of American (pro level) football to Europe for the first time, during a five-game exhibition tour in June 1977 between the Nite Hawks and the Chicago Lions of the Northern States AAA Pro Football League playing exhibition games in major European cities, including Paris, Lille, Frankfurt, Gratz and Vienna.

In the fall of 1977, he was hired away from the Nite Hawks to take over the reins of the struggling NSFL Quad City Mohawks in Rock Island, IL, (the one time home of charter NFL team, the Rock Island Independents led by star player Jim Thorpe). Foster rebranded the club as the Black Hawks, as well as rebuilding the team roster. That led to their first winning season in a decade and a berth in the 1978 NSFL Championship game. In June 1979 Foster, working with a major European based sports/events promotion firm, Keith Prowse Co., conducted a 2nd European Pro Football 5 game tour featuring the Black Hawks vs. the Indianapolis Capitols, also of the NSFL, playing in Brussels, Antwerp, Rotterdam and Frankfurt, (2 games).

Following that 2nd European venture, in the fall of 1979, Foster was hired by the NFL to become the promotion manager of NFL Properties, (marketing and licensing). During his tenure with the NFL (1979–82) he invented the game of arena football while watching the Major Indoor Soccer League All-Star game being played at Madison Square Garden on February 11, 1981. He sketched out a diagram along with basic rules on the back of a 9&quot; × 12&quot; manila envelope.

Foster opted to leave the NFL in September 1982 to pursue a goal of managing a major professional football team, taking an offer to help launch the Phoenix-based Arizona Wranglers as assistant general manager during their inaugural 1983 season in the new USFL. After the season ended, he then accepted an offer to move back to the Midwest to serve as executive vice president of the Chicago Blitz of the USFL.

When the fateful decision was later made to move the USFL in 1985 from a spring season to a fall season on a head-to-head basis with the NFL, Foster made a pivotal decision to begin working full-time on carefully testing and researching the mechanics and basic rules of the new game he had invented before actually launching the Arena Football League (AFL), starting play in early June 1987. Foster served as founding president and commissioner from 1985 to 1992, at which time he stepped down to begin the initial development of his own AFL team, the Iowa Barnstormers, which would bring professional football to his home state of Iowa for the first time, playing in the state&#x27;s capitol and largest city, Des Moines. After staging a very successful and well received sold-out preseason, market test game on April 22, 1993, Foster opted to move forward, completing the raising of the required capital to fund and operate the team and launch operations in June 1994 in preparation for a 1995 inaugural season. He served as its Managing Owner through 2001. A very difficult decision was made to sell the team due to rapidly raising personnel operating expenses, as well as having to continue to play in an iconic, but antiqued and undersized venue in Des Moines. The AFL Barnstormers were sold to NHL NY Islanders owner Charles Wong and moved to Long Island in New York to become the New York Dragons.

In 1999 Foster co-founded and helped organize the AFL&#x27;s developmental league, af2, in addition to founding and organizing the Quad City Steamwheelers af2 team in 1999 and serving as managing owner through the 2006 season. The Steamwheelers won back to back af2 titles in 2000 and 2001 with a 33–1 record. They were undefeated in their inaugural season going 19–0, (a recognized all time pro football record).

In 1990, thanks to a lengthy, successful effort by well known Chicago-based intellectual properties attorney, William Niro, Foster was granted a US patent on the game of arena football and the equipment unique to it, particularly the end zone Goalside Rebound Nets and padded Sideline Barriers, meaning that other indoor football leagues not affiliated with the AFL were legally required to play by at least somewhat different rules than the ones the AFL uses until the patent expired in September 2007. as a result, Arena Football became the first USA based team sport to ever play with a US patent in place. This primarily included no use of the Goalside/cross bar and flanking nets apparatus, as well as that no active usage of the Sideline Barriers could be incorporated into game playing rules. Additional patents were also secured for the arena football game system on an international basis, primarily in multiple European countries and also Mexico. The AFL/patent holders attempted to claim that several other properties of the game were covered under the patent, but a successful 1998 lawsuit from a competing upstart league, (which continues to play today without the goalside net system, instead hanging a simple plastic goal from the arena rafters) narrowed the AFL&#x27;s patent mainly to the Goalside/cross bar/flanking nets apparatus).

Foster and his family, (Susan, Nile and Palmer) moved from Chicago to Des Moines in August 1994 and lived there from 1994 to 2002 while he operated the Iowa Barnstormers in the AFL through the 2000 season and then as an af2 team for the 2001 season. He also served on the Iowa State Historical Society foundation board, 1998–2002 while living in Des Moines. Foster moved his family to Davenport, Iowa, in August 2002 to oversee operations of the Steamwheelers on a full-time basis.

Jim Foster was inducted into the American Football Association&#x27;s Minor Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1982, the Arena Football League Hall of Fame inaugural class in 1998 and the af2, (arena football2 league) inaugural Hall of Fame class of 2009 and the Intellectual Properties Lawyers Hall of Fame from Iowa, class of 2008. Foster served is an adjunct professor in the Tippie College of Business, a Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Center in Iowa City, teaching pro sports management from 2011 to 2013, in addition to continuing his ongoing sports/events and marketing-related consulting projects work through Fostering Sports, Inc. based in Davenport. He continues to do collegiate level guest lecturing and mentoring, as well as motivational themed public speaking and interviews. He also served on the board of the Quad Cities area Iowa Athletics I Club Board of Directors (2008–2020) and is also a member of the Iowa Gamma Sigma Phi Epsilon Alumni Board of Directors (2010-).

==Personal life==
His younger son Palmer, became a 3rd generation Iowa Hawkeye student-athlete, following in the footsteps of his grandfather Derrold (Pat) Foster (football, track and JV basketball and baseball 1945–1949), then by his father Jim. Palmer played Hawkeye football 2011–2013,(letter winner and honor student). After graduating from UIowa in 2014, Palmer was selected and received a post graduate academic-athletic scholarship to play and coach football with the Durham University Saints in Durham UK, 2014–2015 in the British University League while earning a master&#x27;s degree at Durham. He then played one season of American pro level football in the Polish American Football league, followed by 6 seasons in the British Premiere American Football League, 2016-2019 and 2021-2022 where he earned multiple honors for his play as an outside linebacker.He also was selected after a multi step tryout process as a member of the Italian National American Football team in 2019 and played in two European Championship series games vs. the Swiss National team in Zurich and the Austrian National team in Vienna, (both wins).

<text>The Universidade de São Paulo (, USP) is a public research university in the Brazilian state of São Paulo, and the largest public university in Brazil. 

The university was founded on 25 January 1934, regrouping already existing schools in the state of São Paulo, such as the Law School, the Polytechnic School, and the College of Agriculture. The university&#x27;s foundation in that year was marked by the creation of the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences and Literature, and subsequently new departments. Currently, the university is involved in teaching, research, and university extension in all areas of knowledge, offering a broad range of courses. It has eleven campuses, four of them in the city of São Paulo. The remaining campuses are in the cities of Bauru, Lorena, Piracicaba, Pirassununga, Ribeirão Preto and two in São Carlos.

University of São Paulo alumni and faculty include past or present 13 Brazilian presidents, numerous Nobel nominees, members of the National Congress, founders and executives of notable Brazilian companies, as has been alma mater for numerous alums of important positions in Brazilian society. Regarding research, the USP is among Brazil&#x27;s largest research institutions, producing more than 25% of the scientific papers published by Brazilian researchers in high-quality conferences and journals.

==History==
After its defeat in the Constitutionalist Revolution, São Paulo needed institutional improvements. Therefore, in 1933, a group of businessmen founded the &quot;Free School of Sociology and Politics&quot; (ELSP) (the current Foundation of the &quot;School of Sociology and Politics&quot; in São Paulo). In 1934, the intervenor of São Paulo (which corresponded to the governor), Armando de Sales Oliveira, founded the University of São Paulo (USP).

That was one of the efforts to provide Brazil with modern administrative, educational, and military institutions in a period known as &quot;search for alternatives&quot;. One of the main initiatives included the founding, that same year, of the University of São Paulo. Its nucleus was the School of Philosophy, Sciences, and Languages, with professors from France, Italy, Spain, Germany, and other European countries. The ELSP assumed the goal of administrative elites to form a new model in which they noted an increasing role of the state. At the same time, the USP focused on training teachers for secondary schools, experts in sciences, engineers, lawyers, physicians, and professors. The ELSP followed a sociological American model, while the USP used the French academic world as its primary source of inspiration.

Foreign professors such as Claude Lévi-Strauss (France), Fernand Braudel (France), Roger Bastide (France), Robert H. Aubreton (France), Heinrich Rheinboldt (Germany), Paul Arbousse Bastide (France), Jean Magüé (France), Martial Gueroult (France), Emilio Willems (Germany), Donald Pierson (US), Gleb Vassielievich Wataghin (Russia), Pierre Monbeig (France), Giacomo Albanese (Italy), Luigi Fantappiè (Italy), Vilém Flusser (Czech Republic), Giuseppe Ungaretti (Italy) and Herbert Baldus (Germany), broadcast in various institutions new standards for teaching and research, creating new generations of scientists in Brazil.

Since its foundation the USP received professors and researchers from all over the world, such as David Bohm (US), Giuseppe Occhialini (Italy), François Châtelet (France), Anatol Rosenfeld (Germany), Helmi Nasr (Egypt), Gérard Lebrun (France), Fritz Köberle (Austria), Alexander Grothendieck (France), and Heinz Dieter Heidemann (Germany).

===Origins===
The University of São Paulo is the result of a combination of the newly founded School of Philosophy, Sciences and Languages (Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras, FFCL, currently the Faculty of Philosophy, Languages and Human Sciences – Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humana&quot;s&quot;, FFLCH) with the existing Polytechnic School of Engineering (founded in 1893), the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture (Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz) (founded in 1901), the Medical School (founded in 1912), the traditional Law School (founded in 1827), the old School of Pharmacy and Dentistry (founded in 1898), the Institute of Astronomy, Geophysics and Atmospheric Sciences (founded in 1886), and the School of Veterinary Medicine (founded in 1919).

The FFCL emerged as the integrating element of the university, bringing together courses in various areas of knowledge. Also, in 1934, the &quot;School of Physical Education&quot; (sports science) of the State of São Paulo was created, the first civil school of physical education in Brazil, which would later be part of the university. In 1944, the Medical School opened its public hospital (&quot;Hospital das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo&quot;). The School of Engineering of Sao Carlos (EESC) emerged in the same year. In subsequent years, several other research units were also created, such as a second Medical School located in the city of Ribeirão Preto (São Paulo&#x27;s inland) in 1952.

In the 1960s, the university gradually transferred the headquarters of some of its units to the &quot;City University Armando de Salles Oliveira&quot;, in São Paulo. In 1963, the Heart Institute of the University of São Paulo was founded. After that, new institutes and schools were created, for instance, the &quot;School of Journalism, Communications and Arts&quot; (ECA) in 1966. Over the years, some of the university&#x27;s old departments were transformed into autonomous faculties or institutes, such as the &quot;Institute of Biomedical Sciences&quot; (ICB), the &quot;Institute of Geosciences&quot; (IGc), and the &quot;Institute of Biosciences&quot; (IB) in 1969.

===Military dictatorship===
During the 1970s and part of the 1980s, some critics believed that the USP underwent an intellectual dissection in terms of knowledge production and the quality of human resources. During the past decades, the university played an essential role in the discussion and dissemination of important political ideas that contributed to the democratization of the country, bringing together many leftist intellectuals (such as Florestan Fernandes, Boris Fausto, Paul Singer, Antonio Candido, Gioconda Mussolini among others).

During the Brazilian dictatorship, a large number of professors from the USP were persecuted and even tortured – many were forced to leave the country. This slowed down scientific production in Brazil. It also promoted a systematic increase in the total number of graduate vacancies, encouraged by the state government.

The gap caused by the removal of teachers and students chased by the military regime was interrupted by the campaign of political amnesty in the early 1980s. Several units of the USP celebrated the return of their deposed professors, although many of them were rehired under different conditions (former full professors took new positions as assistant professors).

===Expansion===
Parallel to the resulting intellectual emptiness of political repression in the 1960s-80s, academic units were fragmented; new faculties and institutes were created, resulting in new courses, new lines of research, and graduate programs. Originally conceived as the university&#x27;s academic core – gathering itself the various fields of knowledge – the FFCL (&quot;School of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters&quot;) saw its departments gain autonomy and become separate units. The &quot;Institute of Physics&quot; was the first department to extricate itself from the old FFCL, followed by other natural science departments.

In 2004, the university founded the &quot;Institute of International Relations&quot; to study global matters in a multidisciplinary environment (law, political science, economy, and history) with Brazilian and international students and professors (&quot;International Exchange Program&quot;). In 2005, it was built in the East Zone of the city of São Paulo a new &quot;School of Arts, Sciences, and Humanities&quot; (EACH), taking a few courses that go beyond the traditional Brazilian university model and aim to diversify the areas of the consolidated institution. [22] On 21 March 2006, the USP approved the merger of a second &quot;School of Chemical Engineering&quot; (FAENQUIL) in the city of Lorena (rural area), at the Paraíba Valley (State of São Paulo&#x27;s rural area), with about 1,600 students in total and of these 1,200 at graduation. In 2007, a second Law School was established in the city of Ribeirão Preto, also in the State of São Paulo&#x27;s countryside.

==Academics==
Today, the USP has five hospitals and offers 247 undergraduate programs and 239 graduate programs in all areas of study. The university houses altogether 24 museums and galleries – with half a million visitors a year – two theaters, a cinema, a TV channel and an orchestra. The University of São Paulo welcomes people from all continents and stimulates this process via networks and consortiums (International Office – USP), such as Erasmus Mundus, Associação das Universidades de Língua Portuguesa, and Rede Magalhães (SMILE – Student Mobility in Latin America, Caribbean and Europe), among others.

===Rankings===
According to ARWU, the USP was classified in first place regarding the number of doctorates awarded during 2011. USP is ranked among the top 70 universities in the world, in the Ranking &quot;Top Universities by Reputation 2013&quot; published by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;. According to the 2013 Academic Ranking of World Universities, the USP is placed in the group of the 101–151 top world universities. According to the 2020 CWTS Leiden Ranking, the University of São Paulo is ranked 7th in the world. In the 2024 QS World University Rankings, the University of São Paulo ranked 85th in the world and is ranked 1st in Latin America. As of 2021, the University of São Paulo is the first Latin American institution in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings to be ranked at 201-250th.

===Healthcare===
The USP operates four hospitals, among them University of São Paulo Medical School Public Hospital, the largest hospital complex in Latin America and the major teaching and training site for the university&#x27;s Faculty of Medicine, which is highly ranked within Latin America. All of them are:

* University of São Paulo Medical School Public Hospital
* Heart Institute of the University of São Paulo
* Public Hospital of Ribeirão Preto Medical School
* Hospital de Reabilitação de Anomalias Craniofaciais – Centrinho

===Library system===
The USP has 42 libraries managed by the Integrated Library System (&quot;SIB – Sistema Integrado de Bibliotecas&quot; in Portuguese), which is also responsible for the university&#x27;s online system, DEDALUS.

Dedalus is an online database that allows simultaneous consultation in all university libraries. It is also integrated into a system named Integrated Research, which integrates all online databases signed by the university. This makes academic research faster and provides researchers with easy access to international publications.

===Museums and art galleries===
The University of São Paulo manages a rich set of museums and art galleries, most of them located on the central campus in the city of São Paulo:
* Museu de Arte Contemporânea da Universidade de São Paulo (Museum of Contemporary Art)
* Museu Paulista (Historical Museum of São Paulo)
* Museu de Zoologia (Museum of Zoology)
* MAE-USP – Museu de Arqueologia e Etnologia (Museum of Archeology and Ethnology)
* Museu do Café Francisco Schmidt (Ribeirão Preto Campus)

===Academic career===

* Teaching Assistant (Auxiliar de Ensino)—MS-2 (must have a master&#x27;s degree and be enrolled in a doctoral program). Undergraduate students can also be teaching assistants for a semester, with scholarships from each department.
* Professor Doctor (Professor Doutor) – MS-3 (must have a doctoral or equivalent degree).
* Associate Professor (Professor Associado) – MS-5 (must have a &quot;Livre Docente&quot; title; equivalent to the German Habilitation).
* Full Professor (Professor Titular) – MS-6 (top rank, only MS-6 professors can hold positions such as the Dean of a Faculty/School or the university&#x27;s Rector).

==Admissions==
Brazilian students take the USP&#x27;s entrance exam, the vestibular, which is prepared and administered by FUVEST (University Foundation for Vestibular), subject to regulations approved by the university&#x27;s Undergraduate Studies Council. In 2012, 159,603 students signed up for Fuvest&#x27;s vestibular for 10,982 openings. Candidates must take a multiple-choice test involving chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, geography, history, Portuguese, and English. The second round of tests is written and specific to the chosen field of studies, including more in-depth questions in physics, chemistry, and mathematics for engineering; history, math, and geography for law; and so on. In-depth written Portuguese questions are required for all.

More recently, students have also been able to access the university by taking the nation-wide high school evaluation test, ENEM, through the Unified Selection System (SISU). Each undergraduate course manages the vacancies available for each admission process.

International students may come through several exchange programs. In 2012, the USP hosted over 2,300 exchange students. Roughly a third of the international students are enrolled in humanities and social sciences, with another third in engineering courses.

The USP does not require its students, national or foreign, to pay any tuition, as its source of funding comes from the state of São Paulo.

==Organization==
The USP corresponds to the idea of &quot;university&quot; as a set of autonomous schools, institutes, and colleges, each responsible for one area of knowledge (the aforementioned thirty-six teaching, research, and extension). Like most Brazilian universities, it grants autonomy to its teaching, research, and extension units regarding the didactic organization and curricular definition of each of the courses, which often results in a considered excessive fragmentation of teaching and research and the disconnection between the knowledge produced in each of the units.

Each unit is divided into departments. A department is usually responsible for one of the courses offered by the unit or for a specific search line. In the case of units with only one or two courses, departments are not responsible for the entire course but for a part of it. Due to the aforementioned fragmentation and decentralization of the university, it is common to see departments with similar profiles in different units, which raises criticism as to the effectiveness of public investments and duplication of efforts.

===Administration===
The administrative structure of the USP has in the Rectory its central organ, as well as in the Rector the main figure of the university. Subordinated to the Rectory are the four Pro-Rectorates, specialized agencies in each of the university&#x27;s fields of activity: &quot;Pro-Rectorate&quot; (PRG), &quot;Post-Graduation Pro-Rectorate&quot; (PRPG), &quot;Pro-Rectory of Research&quot; (PRP) and &quot;Pro-Rectory of Culture and Extension&quot; (PRC).

In recent years, there has been discussion about creating a &quot;Pro-Rectorate for Student Assistance,&quot; a subject that, according to critics, has always been considered secondary to the university&#x27;s leaders.

==In popular culture==
* The USP is referenced in Bernardo Kucinski&#x27;s 2011 novel, &quot;K&quot;, a fictionalized account of the disappearance of an assistant lecturer in 1974 and her father&#x27;s desperate attempt to find her.

<text>Zenna Chlarson Henderson (November 1, 1917 – May 11, 1983) was an American elementary school teacher and science fiction and fantasy author. Her first story was published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; in 1951. Her work is cited as pre-feminist, often featuring middle-aged women, children, and their relationships, but with stereotyped gender roles. Many of her stories center around human aliens called &quot;The People&quot;, who have special powers. Henderson was nominated for a Hugo Award in 1959 for her novelette &quot;Captivity&quot;. Science fiction authors Lois McMaster Bujold, Orson Scott Card, Connie Willis, Dale Bailey, and Kathy Tyers have cited her as an influence on their work.

== Biography ==
Zena Chlarson (she began using the spelling &quot;Zenna&quot; in the early 1950s) was born in 1917 in Tucson, Arizona, the daughter of Louis Rudolph Chlarson and Emily Vernell Rowley. She was the oldest of five children. She began reading science fiction at age 12 from magazines such as &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;, &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, and fantasy from &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. She cited Heinlein, Bradbury, Clement, and Asimov as her favorite science fiction writers.

She received a bachelor of arts in education from Arizona State College in 1940, and taught school, primarily in the Tucson area, mainly first grade. She also taught in a &quot;semi-ghost mining town,&quot; at Fort Huachuca, in France and Connecticut, as well as in a Japanese internment camp in Sacaton, Arizona, during World War II. She married Richard Harry Henderson in 1943, but they were divorced in 1951. In 1955 she received her MA, also from Arizona State College, and continued to teach elementary school.

Henderson was one of the first 203 female science fiction authors to publish in American science fiction magazines between 1926 and 1960. She never used a male pseudonym. In an essay on the increase in women authors of science fiction in 1950, Sam Merwin mentioned her as an up-and-coming woman SF writer. Her first story was published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; in 1951. Her work has been called feminist, pre-feminist, and &quot;distinctly feminine, without being politically feminist.&quot; Some feminist critics disliked the gender stereotypes present in her fiction, though her work depicts middle-aged and old women as well as women&#x27;s relationships. Her women protagonists cherish social roles as mothers and sisters while also being &quot;strong, intelligent&quot;, and &quot;outspoken&quot;. In an analysis of &quot;Subcommittee,&quot; Farah Mendlesohn examines how Henderson uses stereotypical gender roles to emphasize how feminine communication is conducive to peacemaking. In &quot;Subcommittee,&quot; the wife of a general, Serena, befriends an alien mother and her child. Through their sharing of &quot;women&#x27;s things&quot; like cooking and knitting, Serena finds out that the aliens need salt to continue their species. After hearing that peace negotiations are deteriorating, Serena interrupts a meeting with her revelation and a proposed solution. Unlike other popular science fiction at the time, which often centered around war with aliens, &quot;Subcommittee&quot; focuses on conflict resolution. The characters&#x27; gender roles enabled the ending plot twist, but were not the focus of speculation.

Henderson was born and baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Though she never renounced her membership, after her marriage, she was no longer a churchgoing Latter-day Saint. In the standard reference &quot;Contemporary Authors&quot;, she identified as Methodist, and according to &quot;Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature, Volume 2&quot;, she was a member of Catalina United Methodist Church in Tucson. During her later years, she attended an independent charismatic fellowship. Her work contains many Christian themes and Biblical names. Many of her stories include The People, aliens who have traveled to Earth, which is their promised land. The People also invoke God as &quot;the Power, the Presence and the Name.&quot;

Zenna Henderson died of cancer in 1983.

== Works ==
Most of Henderson&#x27;s stories emphasize the theme of being different and the dangers therein. They often feature children or adolescents. Most are part of her series concerning the history of &quot;The People&quot;, human beings from a faraway planet who are forced to emigrate to Earth when their home world is destroyed by a natural disaster. 

Arriving in the late 1800s, and on arrival scattered mostly throughout the American Southwest, they are set apart by their desire to preserve their home culture, including their religious and spiritual beliefs. Their unusual abilities include telepathy, telekinesis, prophecy, and healing, which they call the &quot;Designs and Persuasions&quot;. 

The People suppress their unusual abilities as they attempt to integrate into human society. The stories describe groups of The People, as well as lonely isolated individuals, most often as they attempt to find their own communities and remain distinct in a world that does not understand them. This aspect of individuality was a common theme in most of Henderson&#x27;s writing. &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Basil Davenport described the stories as &quot;haunting&quot;. Brian W. Aldiss and David Wingrove noted that &quot;As a sentimental portrait of the alien, the series out-Simaks Simak.&quot; In a book on early women science fiction writers, Eric Davin noted that all of her stories focus on &quot;the search for community and communication,&quot; a theme shared by many women&#x27;s science fiction stories from the time. Henderson&#x27;s years as a school teacher helped her to write believable child characters.

Beginning with &quot;Ararat&quot; (1952), Henderson&#x27;s The People stories appeared in magazines and anthologies, as well as the novelized &quot;Pilgrimage: The Book of the People&quot; (1961) and &quot;The People: No Different Flesh&quot; (1966). Other volumes include &quot;The People Collection&quot; (1991) and &quot;&quot; (1995).

A common conflict in Henderson&#x27;s stories is when a child has unusual powers that a school teacher discovers through observation. 

In &quot;The Last Step&quot;, a children&#x27;s teacher in a future fakes various petty measures to interrupt a children&#x27;s game on the grounds that they take it too seriously, unaware that the &quot;game&quot; is in fact using sympathetic magic to save the colony from an upcoming hostile invasion. 

In &quot;The Believing Child&quot;, a young daughter of a migrant worker believes so strongly in an imaginary magic word that its powers come true; she then uses her newfound powers to take revenge on her abusive classmates.

Compared to these are more frequent, gentler tales such as in &quot;The Anything Box,&quot; in which a teacher learns that an unhappy little girl has discovered a box in which she can see her heart&#x27;s desire. After struggling with her desire to steal the Anything Box for herself, the teacher must instruct the girl on how to use it safely without becoming &quot;lost&quot; in it.

Henderson mentions mental illness in several tales, including obsessive-compulsive disorder in &quot;Swept and Garnished&quot;, and agoraphobia in &quot;Incident After&quot;. In &quot;One of Them&quot;, a woman&#x27;s latent telepathic powers cause her to lose her identity as she unwittingly probes the minds of her co-workers. In &quot;You Know What, Teacher?&quot; a young girl confides in her teacher of her father&#x27;s philandering, and of her mother&#x27;s plan for revenge.

== Adaptations in other media ==
Henderson&#x27;s story &quot;Pottage&quot; was made into the 1972 ABC-TV Movie, &quot;The People&quot;, featuring William Shatner, Kim Darby, and Diane Varsi, and concerning the story of a group of human extraterrestrials who live in an isolated rural community on Earth. It was the directorial debut for John Korty and was produced by his sometime partner Francis Ford Coppola. It has been released on VHS format by Prism Entertainment and DVD format by American Zoetrope.

Henderson&#x27;s story &quot;Hush&quot; was adapted as an episode of the George A. Romero TV series &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;. The episode first aired in 1988.

== Awards ==
Henderson was nominated for a Hugo Award in 1959 for her novelette &quot;Captivity&quot;. Her books were long out of print until the 1995 release of &quot;&quot;, published by the New England Science Fiction Association Press. &quot;Ingathering&quot; was a second place finalist in the 1996 Locus Award for Best Collection.

<doc id="561508" wikidata="Q1210639" url="?curid=561508" title="Dido-class cruiser">
<text>The Dido&quot; classconsisted of sixteen [[light cruiser]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]]. The first group of three ships were commissioned in 1940; the second group of six ships and third group of two were commissioned between 1941 and 1942. A fourth group, also described as theImproved Didoor Bellona&quot; class (five ships) were commissioned between 1943 and 1944. Most members of the class were given names drawn from classical history and legend. The groups differed in armament, and for the &quot;Bellona&quot;s, in function. The &quot;Dido&quot; class were designed to replace the C-class and D-class cruisers as small fleet cruisers and flotilla leaders for the destroyer screen. As designed, they mounted five twin 5.25-inch high-angle gun turrets on the centreline providing dual-purpose anti-air and anti-surface capacity; the complex new turrets were unreliable when introduced, and somewhat unsatisfactory at a time when the UK faced a fight for survival.

During the war, the original 1939–42 ships required extensive refit work to increase electrical generating capacity for additional wartime systems (notably radar and gun direction equipment) and in the final &quot;Bellona,&quot; HMS &quot;Diadem&quot;, fully-electric turrets. While some damage was experienced initially in extreme North Atlantic weather, changes to gun handling and drill partially mitigated the problems. The fitting of the three forward turrets in the double-superfiring A-B-C arrangement (although in Royal Navy classification, fifth turrets were called &quot;Q&quot;, not &quot;C&quot;) relied upon the heavy use of aluminium in the ships&#x27; superstructure, and the lack of aluminium after the evacuation of the British Army from France was one of the primary reasons for the first group only receiving four turrets, while the third group received four twin 4.5-inch mounts and no 5.25-inch guns at all. The &quot;Bellonas&quot; were designed from the start with four radar-directed 5.25-inch gun turrets with full Remote Power Control and an expanded light anti-aircraft battery, substantially increasing their efficiency as AA platforms.

From the initial trials of the lead ship &quot;Bonaventure&quot;, the new light cruisers were considered a significant advancement and were surprisingly effective in later actions in the Mediterranean Sea, such as protecting convoys to Malta, seeing off far larger ships of the Italian Royal Navy. The gun was primarily an anti-surface weapon but designed to fire the heaviest shell suitable for manual loading for use in anti-aircraft defence, and accounted for around 23 aircraft and deterred far more. Both the &quot;Didos&quot; and &quot;Bellonas&quot; were dogged by roller path jams in the rail track upon which the turret gunhouses rotated. These issues regularly put turrets out of action from their initial sea trials until the last operational service of &quot;Euryalus&quot; and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; with the RN in 1953–54 and were the bane of the three &quot;Bellonas&quot; operated postwar by the RNZN.. The original &quot;Dido&quot;-class ships , , and were lost in the war. The survivor, name ship , was put into reserve in 1947 and decommissioned ten years later. was the last of the original class to see service, being decommissioned in 1954 and scrapped in 1959.

The &quot;Bellona&quot; class (as well as four rebuilt &quot;Didos&quot;) were mainly intended as picket ships for amphibious warfare operations in support of aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy and United States Navy in the Pacific. was the only ship of the sub-class to be sunk, struck by a German Fritz X glide bomb while supporting the landings of the Battle of Anzio. Two ships were to be modified to be command ships of aircraft carrier and cruiser groups, intended for action against planned German battlecruisers. Originally these were to be &quot;Scylla&quot; and &quot;Charybdis&quot; of the third group, but the 1943 loss of &quot;Charybdis&quot; saw &quot;Royalist&quot; of the fourth (&quot;Bellona&quot;) group selected instead; these were also known as the Modified &quot;Dido&quot;&quot;.&quot;

Postwar modernisation proposals were limited by the tight war emergency design. There was insufficient space and weight for the fire control and magazines of four or five modern twin 3-inch turrets, combined with the fact that the 5.25-inch shells had a much larger bursting charge than the smaller 4.5-inch guns in service postwar, making them more effective high-altitude AA weapons. was rebuilt for potential action alongside the battleship against the post-war Soviet s and s and was loaned to the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) from 1956 to 1966.

==Armament==

The class were intended to be armed with ten 5.25-inch (133 mm) guns in five twin turrets, which were of the same circular design as the secondary armament in the s. Due to a shortage of the guns caused by difficulties in manufacturing them, the first group were built with only four 5.25-inch gun turrets. Only HMS &quot;Dido&quot; had the fifth turret added later. The first group was also armed with a gun for firing star shells and two quadruple QF 2-pounder (40 mm) &quot;pom-poms&quot; for anti-aircraft defence.

The second group had all five twin 5.25-inch turrets and did not require the 4-inch gun. The third group&#x27;s armament was changed due to the shortage of 5.25-inch guns and had eight QF 4.5-inch (113 mm) guns in four twin turrets instead. The 4.5-inch turret was better suited to the primary anti-aircraft role of the &quot;Dido&quot; class but the ammunition was considered too heavy for peacetime use. The forward (A and B) 4.5-inch turrets were mounted on the top of conjoint deckhouses. The superstructure extended forward with more crew accommodation and radar rooms which allowed the two cruisers to operate as flagships. The high rate of fire of the 4.5-inch turrets, together with simpler dual-purpose twin Director Control Tower (DCT), meant that &quot;Scylla&quot; and &quot;Charybdis&quot; were arguably the only members of the &quot;Dido&quot; class that were true AA cruisers. The 4-inch gun was also fitted and the 2-pounder armament was increased from eight to ten.

The &quot;Bellona&quot; subclass differed in appearance somewhat from their predecessors. They had eight 5.25-inch RP10 Mk II guns in four twin turrets and had greatly improved anti-aircraft armament, with twelve 2-pounder guns and twelve Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The bridge of the &quot;Bellona&quot; class was lowered by one deck compared to the previous three groups. This reduced topweight and so full radar control could be fitted to the 5.25-inch turrets and the 2-pounder guns. These ships used the HACS high angle fire control system. The two funnels were more upright than the raked ones of the original &quot;Dido&quot; class.

==Service==

In World War II, the &quot;Dido&quot; class saw much action, including the Battle of Cape Matapan, the Second Battle of Sirte, Operation Torch, Operation Overlord and the Battle of Okinawa, as well as many other duties in the Mediterranean and Pacific. The production of the 5.25 turrets during the war and the turrets reconstruction, with remote power for faster elevation and training and better fire control was slow, difficult and expensive and largely limited to the cruisers rebuilt after severe action damage in the United States, Argonaut, Cleopatra and Phoebe. It was never completed on several Dido that survived the war. Five ships were lost during the war: , , , , and . was badly damaged by a naval mine and declared a constructive total loss. The post-war survivors continued in service; all were decommissioned by the 1960s. , and were lent to the Royal New Zealand Navy post-World War II. In 1956, was sold to Pakistan and renamed &quot;Babur&quot;.

==Ship modifications==

===&quot;Dido&quot;s===

&quot;Bonaventure&quot; completed with only four twin 5.25-inch turrets because of shortages and received a 4-inch starshell gun in &quot;X&quot; position. She received a radar set before October 1940 but was otherwise unaltered. &quot;Naiad&quot; was completed with five turrets. She received five 20 mm in September 1941 and had Type 279 radar by this time. completed with four turrets and was fitted with a 4-inch gun in &quot;C&quot; position forward of the bridge. The latter was &#x27;landed&#x27; (removed) during her refit between November 1941 and April 1942 at New York City, along with the 0.5-inch machine guns and Type 279 radar, while a quadruple 2 pdr replaced the 4-inch gun and eleven 20 mm guns were fitted. Radars were now Type 281, 284 and 285. The &quot;A&quot; turret was temporarily removed at the end of 1942 after torpedo damage. During repairs in the first six months of 1943, all three quadruple 2-pounder pom-pom mounts were landed, as were seven 20 mm, to be replaced by three quadruple 40 mm Bofors guns and six twin 20 mm. Radar Type 272 was also fitted. Her A turret was replaced in July 1943. Her light anti-aircraft weaponry in April 1944 was twelve 40 mm (3 × 4) and sixteen 20 mm (6 × dual, 4 × single).

&quot;Dido&quot; had four turrets and a 4-inch gun similar to &quot;Phoebe&quot;. The 4-inch and the machine guns were removed in the latter half of 1941 at Brooklyn Navy Yard, when the &quot;Q&quot; position 5.25-inch turret was shipped and four 20 mm were fitted, two of which replaced the original quadruple 0.5 mm machine guns. In the early summer of 1943 three 20 mm were exchanged for four twin 20 mm and the radar outfit was altered by the addition of Types 272, 282, 284 and 285. April 1944 lists show only eight 20 mm.
 completed with her designed armament. In September 1941 the .5-inch machine guns were landed and five single 20 mm fitted. Two more were added by September 1942. By mid-1943 two 20 mm had been removed and four twin 20 mm shipped. The type 279 radar was replaced by types 272, 281, 282 and 285. In a long refit from October 1943 to July 1944, C turret was replaced by a quadruple 2-pounder pom-pom and two twin 20 mm were fitted. Radar 271 and 272 were removed and types 279b, 277 and 293 fitted.

&quot;Hermione&quot; was also completed as a five-turret ship. She had the .5-inch MGs removed in October–November 1941 and received five 20 mm.

 was completed with five turrets and five 20 mm. She had received two more 20 mm by mid-1943. One of these was landed at Massawa at the end of 1943 and two 40 mm Bofors Mk III were fitted. She is listed as having only seven 20 mm as light AA in April 1944. By April 1945 she had two Mk III 40 mm fitted and had landed two 20 mm.

 was completed with two 2-pounder pom-poms in 1942 in lieu of the .5-inch machine guns but these were removed in the middle of the year and replaced by five 20 mm. A sixth 20 mm was added in mid-1943. During repairs between November 1943 and November 1944, Q turret was removed, as were two quadruple 2-pounder pom-poms and five 20 mm. Three quadruple 40 mm Bofors and six twin 20 mm were fitted and there were four single 20 mm. In 1951 the American quadruple Bofors and Oerlikons were replaced by three twin MK 5 Bofors and eight single Mk 7.

 was completed with four 20 mm in lieu of the .5-inch machine guns. She had Q turret removed during repairs in 1943/44, and lost the four 20 mm. She received a quadruple 2-pounder pom-pom in lieu of the 5.25-inch and had five twin 20 mm fitted. By April 1944 her light AA comprised three quadruple 2-pounder pom-poms, six twin power-operated 20 mm and five singles. By the end of the war with Japan she had received five 40 mm Bofors and three 40 mm Bofors Mk III.

 was completed with four twin 4.5-inch Mk III in UD MK III mountings because of a shortage of 5.25-inch mountings. The forward superstructure was considerably modified to accommodate these and also to increase crew spaces. Her light AA on completion was eight single 20 mm. Six twin power-operated 20 mm were added at the end of 1943.

 was also completed with four twin 4.5-inch and had a 4-inch Mk V forward of X mounting. Her light AA at completion was four 20 mm and two single 2-pounder pom-poms. The 4-inch star shell gun and two of the single 2-pounder pom-poms were removed and replaced by two twin and two single 20 mm, probably in 1943.

===&quot;Bellona&quot;s===

 received no alterations as far as is known. &quot;Royalist&quot; was converted to an escort carrier squadron flagship immediately on completion, when an extra two twin 20 mm were fitted as well as four single 20 mm. She was the only ship to receive an extensive postwar modernisation ordered for service in the RN but was later loaned to New Zealand. Plans were drawn up to fully modernise the four improved &quot;Dido&quot;s with either four twin 3-inch L70 guns or 4.5-inch Mark 6 gun turrets. However that would have required building new broad-beamed &quot;Dido&quot;s because the magazines of the &quot;Royalist&quot; type could hold only enough 3 -inch ammunition for 3 minutes 20 seconds of continuous firing. The refit of &quot;Royalist&quot; was shortened and &quot;Diadem&quot;&#x27;s was abandoned because the new steam turbines needed were unaffordable. &quot;Royalist&quot;′s reconstruction, like that of &quot;Newfoundland&quot;, incorporated much of the RN&#x27;s late 1940s and early 1950s view of a desirable cruiser. &quot;Royalist&quot;′s 5.25-inch armament was given some of the improvements of the final 5.25 inch mounts built for the battleship &quot;Vanguard&quot; but not the extra space or power ramming. Also added was a secondary armament of three STAAG automatic twin 40mm guns, new Type 293 and 960M radar and Type 275 (two sets) DP fire control for the 5.25 guns, and a lattice mast. 

&quot;Bellona&quot; had four single 20 mm added by April 1944 and received an extra eight single 20 mm by April 1945. When she was loaned to the RNZN after the war, the twin Oerlikons were replaced by six single 40mm in the RNZN&#x27;s own electric powered mount. &quot;Bellona&quot; was never fitted with six standard tachymetric directors which were requested by the RNZN for controlling the Bofors. The quadruple pom pom mounts were mothballed by RNZN for manning reasons but the single Oerlikons were maintained on &quot;Bellona&quot;.

&quot;Black Prince&quot; and also received eight single 20 mm, and had a further two twin 20 mm by early 1945.

==Post-war development==
Post war in the expanded 1951 programme of the Korean War Emergency a broad beam &quot;Bellona&quot; class armed with four twin 4.5-inch guns was considered as a cruiser option along with the 1951 &quot;Minotaur&quot; class

&quot;Black Prince&quot; was loaned to the RNZN after the war and was operational briefly in 1947 before part of her crew mutinied and were discharged. After refit in 1952, with eight single electric powered 40mm Bofors and six single 20 mm Oerlikon, it was operated till 1955, during which it visited the 1953 Fleet Review at Spithead. &quot;Diadem&quot; (renamed after &quot;Babur&quot;, the founder of the Mughal dynasty) was sold to Pakistan in 1956 after a modest refit with Type 293 and Type 281 radar and standardised twin 40mm twin and single light AA guns. &quot;Babur&quot; became a cadet training ship in 1962 but was brought into use and her 5.25-inch guns were fired in the limited naval activities during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965.

<doc id="561510" wikidata="Q212616" url="?curid=561510" title="The Raft of the Medusa">
<text>The Raft of the Medusa ( ) – originally titled Scène de Naufrage (&quot;Shipwreck Scene&quot;) – is an oil painting of 1818–1819 by the French Romantic painter and lithographer Théodore Géricault (1791–1824). Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism. At , it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval frigate &quot;Méduse&quot;, which ran aground off the coast of today&#x27;s Mauritania on 2 July 1816. On 5 July 1816, at least 150 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism (one custom of the sea). The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain.

Géricault chose this large-scale uncommissioned work to launch his career, using a subject that had already generated widespread public interest. The event fascinated him. Théodore Géricault&#x27;s Robillard relations had close family connections with the French navy and were directly involved in France&#x27;s colonies and France&#x27;s slave trade. Indeed, one of these relations, a naval officer and a slave owner, died defending France&#x27;s colonial interests on the coast of west Africa in 1779 not far from the site of the &quot;Méduse&quot; shipwreck decades later.

Before Géricault began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour and texture of the flesh of the dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the Salon of 1819, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting.

Although &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; retains elements of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents a break from the calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault&#x27;s work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist&#x27;s death at the age of 32. The painting&#x27;s influence can be seen in the works of Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.

== Background ==
In June 1816, the French frigate &quot;Méduse&quot;, captained by Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumareys, departed from Rochefort, bound for the Senegalese port of Saint-Louis. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the storeship &quot;Loire&quot;, the brig &quot;Argus&quot; and the corvette &quot;Écho&quot;. De Chaumareys, a recently returned royalist émigré, had been appointed captain of the frigate by the newly restored Bourbon administration, despite having scarcely sailed in 20 years. After the wreck, public outrage mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to Louis XVIII, though this was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside the concerns of the monarch. The frigate&#x27;s mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France&#x27;s acceptance of the Peace of Paris. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel Julien-Désiré Schmaltz, and his wife and daughter were among the passengers.

In an effort to make good time, the &quot;Méduse&quot; overtook the other ships, but due to poor navigation it drifted off course. On 2 July, it ran aground on a sandbank off the West African coast, near today&#x27;s Mauritania. The collision was widely blamed on the incompetence of De Chaumareys, a returned émigré who lacked experience and ability, but had been granted his commission as a result of an act of political preferment. Efforts to free the ship failed, so, on 5 July, the frightened passengers and crew started an attempt to travel the to the African coast in the frigate&#x27;s six boats. Although the &quot;Méduse&quot; was carrying 400 people, including 160 crew, there was space for only about 250 in the boats. The remainder of the ship&#x27;s complement and half of a contingent of marine infantrymen intended to garrison Senegal—at least 146 men and one woman—were piled onto a hastily built raft, that partially submerged once it was loaded. Seventeen crew members opted to stay aboard the grounded &quot;Méduse&quot;. The captain and crew aboard the other boats intended to tow the raft, but after only a few miles the raft was turned loose. For sustenance the crew of the raft had only a bag of ship&#x27;s biscuit (consumed on the first day), two casks of water (lost overboard during fighting) and six casks of wine.

According to critic Jonathan Miles, the raft carried the survivors &quot;to the frontiers of human experience. Crazed, parched and starved, they slaughtered mutineers, ate their dead companions and killed the weakest.&quot; After 13 days, on 17 July 1816, the raft was rescued by the &quot;Argus&quot; by chance—no particular search effort was made by the French for the raft. By this time only 15 men were still alive; the others had been killed or thrown overboard by their comrades, died of starvation, or had thrown themselves into the sea in despair. The incident became a huge public embarrassment for the French monarchy, only recently restored to power after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1815.

== Description ==
&quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; portrays the moment when, after 13 days adrift on the raft, the remaining 15 survivors view a ship approaching from a distance. According to an early British reviewer, the work is set at a moment when &quot;the ruin of the raft may be said to be complete&quot;. The painting is on a monumental scale of , so that most of the figures rendered are life-sized and those in the foreground almost twice life-size, pushed close to the picture plane and crowding onto the viewer, who is drawn into the physical action as a participant.

The makeshift raft is shown as barely seaworthy as it rides the deep waves, while the men are rendered as broken and in utter despair. One old man holds the corpse of his son at his knees; another tears his hair out in frustration and defeat. A number of bodies litter the foreground, waiting to be swept away by the surrounding waves. The men in the middle have just viewed a rescue ship; one points it out to another, and an African crew member, Jean Charles, stands on an empty barrel and frantically waves his handkerchief to draw the ship&#x27;s attention.
The pictorial composition of the painting is constructed upon two pyramidal structures. The perimeter of the large mast on the left of the canvas forms the first. The horizontal grouping of dead and dying figures in the foreground forms the base from which the survivors emerge, surging upward towards the emotional peak, where the central figure waves desperately at a rescue ship.
The viewer&#x27;s attention is first drawn to the centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors&#x27; bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right. According to the art historian Justin Wintle, &quot;a single horizontal diagonal rhythm [leads] us from the dead at the bottom left, to the living at the apex.&quot; Two other diagonal lines are used to heighten the dramatic tension. One follows the mast and its rigging and leads the viewer&#x27;s eye towards an approaching wave that threatens to engulf the raft, while the second, composed of reaching figures, leads to the distant silhouette of the &quot;Argus&quot;, the ship that eventually rescued the survivors.

Géricault&#x27;s palette is composed of pallid flesh tones, and the murky colours of the survivors&#x27; clothes, the sea and the clouds. Overall the painting is dark and relies largely on the use of sombre, mostly brown pigments, a palette that Géricault believed was effective in suggesting tragedy and pain. The work&#x27;s lighting has been described as &quot;Caravaggesque&quot;, after the Italian artist closely associated with tenebrism—the use of violent contrast between light and dark. Even Géricault&#x27;s treatment of the sea is muted, being rendered in dark greens rather than the deep blues that could have afforded contrast with the tones of the raft and its figures. From the distant area of the rescue ship, a bright light shines, providing illumination to an otherwise dull brown scene.

== Execution ==
=== Research and preparatory studies ===
Géricault was captivated by accounts of the widely publicised 1816 shipwreck, and realised that a depiction of the event might be an opportunity to establish his reputation as a painter. Having decided to proceed, he undertook extensive research before he began the painting. In early 1818, he met with two survivors: Henri Savigny, a surgeon, and Alexandre Corréard, an engineer from the École nationale supérieure d&#x27;arts et métiers. Their emotional descriptions of their experiences largely inspired the tone of the final painting. According to the art historian Georges-Antoine Borias, &quot;Géricault established his studio across from Beaujon hospital. And here began a mournful descent. Behind locked doors he threw himself into his work. Nothing repulsed him. He was dreaded and avoided.&quot;

Earlier travels had exposed Géricault to victims of insanity and plague, and while researching the &quot;Méduse&quot; his effort to be historically accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.

He worked with Corréard, Savigny and another of the survivors, the carpenter Lavillette, to construct an accurately detailed scale model of the raft, which was reproduced on the finished canvas, even showing the gaps between some of the planks. Géricault posed models, compiled a dossier of documentation, copied relevant paintings by other artists, and went to Le Havre to study the sea and sky. Despite suffering from fever, he travelled to the coast on a number of occasions to witness storms breaking on the shore, and a visit to artists in England afforded further opportunity to study the elements while crossing the English Channel.

He drew and painted numerous preparatory sketches while deciding which of several alternative moments of the disaster he would depict in the final work. The painting&#x27;s conception proved slow and difficult for Géricault, and he struggled to select a single pictorially effective moment to best capture the inherent drama of the event.

Among the scenes he considered were the mutiny against the officers from the second day on the raft, the cannibalism that occurred after only a few days, and the rescue. Géricault ultimately settled on the moment, recounted by one of the survivors, when they first saw, on the horizon, the approaching rescue ship &quot;Argus&quot;—visible in the upper right of the painting—which they attempted to signal. The ship, however, passed by. In the words of one of the surviving crew members, &quot;From the delirium of joy, we fell into profound despondency and grief.&quot;

To a public well-versed in the particulars of the disaster, the scene would have been understood to encompass the aftermath of the crew&#x27;s abandonment, focusing on the moment when all hope seemed lost—the &quot;Argus&quot; reappeared two hours later and rescued those who remained.

The author Rupert Christiansen points out that the painting depicts more figures than had been on the raft at the time of the rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.

=== Final work ===
Géricault, who had just been forced to break off a painful affair with his aunt, shaved his head and from November 1818 to July 1819 lived a disciplined monastic existence in his studio in the Faubourg du Roule, being brought meals by his concierge and only occasionally spending an evening out. He and his 18-year-old assistant, Louis-Alexis Jamar, slept in a small room adjacent to the studio; occasionally there were arguments and on one occasion Jamar walked off; after two days Géricault persuaded him to return. In his orderly studio, the artist worked in a methodical fashion in complete silence and found that even the noise of a mouse was sufficient to break his concentration.

He used friends as models, most notably the painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who modelled for the figure in the foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft&#x27;s survivors are seen in shadow at the foot of the mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to slip into the sea, and was also the model for two other figures. 

Much later, Delacroix—who would become the standard-bearer of French Romanticism after Géricault&#x27;s death—wrote, &quot;Géricault allowed me to see his &quot;Raft of Medusa&quot; while he was still working on it. It made so tremendous an impression on me that when I came out of the studio I started running like a madman and did not stop till I reached my own room.&quot;

Géricault, who was an abolitionist, hired a Haitian model named Joseph to paint at least two Black individuals on the raft. Most notably, Joseph served as a model for what is considered to be a representation of Jean Charles, a military officer waving a dark red handkerchief in hopes of being noticed by the passing ship. Influenced by an ancient Greek Classical sculpture titled &quot;Belvedere Torso&quot; and with his back turned toward the viewer, Joseph&#x27;s silhouette is placed atop the pyramidal grouping of survivors in the composition&#x27;s right half. In addition, a small rendering of Joseph&#x27;s face, with his gaze directed toward the spectator, is placed within a group of three figures positioned between the wooden mast and the supporting rope on the mast&#x27;s right-hand side.

Géricault painted with small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed little time for reworking and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, Cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but over a period of time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the work can hardly be discerned today.

Géricault drew an outline sketch of the composition onto the canvas. He then posed models one at a time, completing each figure before moving onto the next, as opposed to the more usual method of working over the whole composition. The concentration in this way on individual elements gave the work both a &quot;shocking physicality&quot; and a sense of deliberate theatricality—which some critics consider an adverse effect. Over 30 years after the completion of the work, his friend Montfort recalled:

[Géricault&#x27;s method] astonished me as much as his intense industry. He painted directly on the white canvas, without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I was struck by the keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas. He seemed to proceed slowly, when in reality he executed very rapidly, placing one touch after the other in its place, rarely having to go over his work more than once. There was very little perceptible movement of his body or arms. His expression was perfectly calm ...

Working with little distraction, the artist completed the painting in eight months; the project as a whole took 18 months.

== Influences ==
&quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; fuses many influences from the Old Masters, from the &quot;Last Judgment&quot; and Sistine Chapel ceiling of Michelangelo (1475–1564) and Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Transfiguration&quot;, to the monumental approach of Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825) and Antoine-Jean Gros (1771–1835), to contemporary events. By the 18th century, shipwrecks had become a recognised feature of marine art – as well as an increasingly common occurrence, for more journeys were made by sea. Claude Joseph Vernet (1714–1789) created many such images, achieving naturalistic colour through direct observation—unlike other artists at that time—and was said to have tied himself to the mast of a ship in order to witness a storm.

Although the men depicted on the raft had spent 13 days adrift and suffered hunger, disease and cannibalism, Géricault pays tribute to the traditions of heroic painting and presents his figures as muscular and healthy. According to the art historian Richard Muther, there is still a strong debt to Classicism in the work. The fact that the majority of the figures are almost naked, he wrote, arose from a desire to avoid &quot;unpictorial&quot; costumes. Muther observes that there is &quot;still something academic in the figures, which do not seem to be sufficiently weakened by privation, disease, and the struggle with death&quot;.

The influence of Jacques-Louis David can be seen in the painting&#x27;s scale, in the sculptural tautness of the figures and in the heightened manner in which a particularly significant &quot;fruitful moment&quot;—the first awareness of the approaching ship—is described. In 1793, David also painted an important current event with &quot;The Death of Marat&quot;. His painting had an enormous political impact during the time of the revolution in France, and it served as an important precedent for Géricault&#x27;s decision to also paint a current event. David&#x27;s pupil, Antoine-Jean Gros, had, like David, represented &quot;the grandiosities of a school irredeemably associated with a lost cause&quot;, but in some major works, he had given equal prominence to Napoleon and anonymous dead or dying figures. Géricault had been particularly impressed by the 1804 painting &quot;Bonaparte Visiting the Plague-Victims of Jaffa&quot;, by Gros.

The young Géricault had painted copies of work by Pierre-Paul Prud&#x27;hon (1758–1823), whose &quot;thunderously tragic pictures&quot; include his masterpiece, &quot;Justice and Divine Vengeance Pursuing Crime&quot;, where oppressive darkness and the compositional base of a naked, sprawled corpse obviously influenced Géricault&#x27;s painting.

The foreground figure of the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, which was one of the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to allude to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.

Several English and American paintings including &quot;The Death of Major Pierson&quot; by John Singleton Copley (1738–1815)—also painted within two years of the event—had established a precedent for a contemporary subject. Copley had also painted several large and heroic depictions of disasters at sea which Géricault may have known from prints: &quot;Watson and the Shark&quot; (1778), in which a black man is central to the action, and which, like &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;, concentrated on the actors of the drama rather than the seascape; &quot;The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782&quot; (1791), which was an influence on both the style and subject matter of Géricault&#x27;s work; and &quot;Scene of a Shipwreck&quot; (1790s), which has a strikingly similar composition. A further important precedent for the political component was the works of Francisco Goya, particularly his &quot;The Disasters of War&quot; series of 1810–12, and his 1814 masterpiece &quot;The Third of May 1808&quot;. Goya also produced a painting of a disaster at sea, called simply &quot;Shipwreck&quot; (date unknown), but although the sentiment is similar, the composition and style have nothing in common with &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;. It is unlikely that Géricault had seen the picture.

== Exhibition and reception ==
&quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; was first shown at the 1819 Paris Salon, under the title &quot;Scène de Naufrage&quot; (&quot;Shipwreck Scene&quot;), although its real subject would have been unmistakable for contemporary viewers. The exhibition was sponsored by Louis XVIII and featured nearly 1,300 paintings, 208 sculptures and numerous other engravings and architectural designs. Géricault&#x27;s canvas was the star at the exhibition: &quot;It strikes and attracts all eyes&quot; (&quot;Le Journal de Paris&quot;). Louis XVIII visited three days before the opening and reportedly said: &quot;&quot;, freely translated as &quot;Monsieur Géricault, your shipwreck is certainly no disaster&quot;. The critics were divided: the horror and &quot;terribilità&quot; of the subject exercised fascination, but devotees of classicism expressed their distaste for what they described as a &quot;pile of corpses&quot;, whose realism they considered a far cry from the &quot;ideal beauty&quot; represented by Girodet&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion and Galatea&quot;, which triumphed the same year. Géricault&#x27;s work expressed a paradox: how could a hideous subject be translated into a powerful painting, how could the painter reconcile art and reality? Marie-Philippe Coupin de la Couperie, a French painter and contemporary of Géricault, provided one answer: &quot;Monsieur Géricault seems mistaken. The goal of painting is to speak to the soul and the eyes, not to repel.&quot; The painting had fervent admirers too, including French writer and art critic Auguste Jal, who praised its political theme, its liberal position–its advancement of the negro and critique of ultra-royalism–and its modernity. The historian Jules Michelet approved: &quot;our whole society is aboard the raft of the Medusa&quot;.

Géricault had deliberately sought to be both politically and artistically confrontational. Critics responded to his aggressive approach in kind, and their reactions were either ones of revulsion or praise, depending on whether the writer&#x27;s sympathies favoured the Bourbon or Liberal viewpoint. The painting was seen as largely sympathetic to the men on the raft, and thus by extension to the anti-imperial cause adopted by the survivors Savigny and Corréard. The decision to place a black man at the pinnacle of the composition was a controversial expression of Géricault&#x27;s abolitionist sympathies. The art critic Christine Riding has speculated that the painting&#x27;s later exhibition in London was planned to coincide with anti-slavery agitation there. According to art critic and curator Karen Wilkin, Géricault&#x27;s painting acts as a &quot;cynical indictment of the bungling malfeasance of France&#x27;s post-Napoleonic officialdom, much of which was recruited from the surviving families of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;&quot;.

The painting generally impressed the viewing public, although its subject matter repelled many, thus denying Géricault the popular acclaim which he had hoped to achieve. At the end of the exhibition, the painting was awarded a gold medal by the judging panel, but they did not give the work the greater prestige of selecting it for the Louvre&#x27;s national collection. Instead, Géricault was awarded a commission on the subject of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which he clandestinely offered to Delacroix, whose finished painting he then signed as his own. Géricault retreated to the countryside, where he collapsed from exhaustion, and his unsold work was rolled up and stored in a friend&#x27;s studio.

Géricault arranged for the painting to be exhibited in London in 1820, where it was shown at William Bullock&#x27;s Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London, from 10 June until the end of the year, and viewed by about 40,000 visitors. During this time, it also upstaged Christ&#x27;s Entry into Jerusalem by Benjamin Haydon. The reception in London was more positive than that in Paris, and the painting was hailed as representative of a new direction in French art. It received more positive reviews than when it was shown at the Salon. In part, this was due to the manner of the painting&#x27;s exhibition: in Paris it had initially been hung high in the Salon Carré—a mistake that Géricault recognised when he saw the work installed—but in London it was placed close to the ground, emphasising its monumental impact. There may have been other reasons for its popularity in England as well, including &quot;a degree of national self-congratulation&quot;, the appeal of the painting as lurid entertainment, and two theatrical entertainments based around the events on the raft which coincided with the exhibition and borrowed heavily from Géricault&#x27;s depiction. From the London exhibition Géricault earned close to 20,000 francs, which was his share of the fees charged to visitors, and substantially more than he would have been paid had the French government purchased the work from him. After the London exhibition, Bullock brought the painting to Dublin early in 1821, but the exhibition there was far less successful, in large part due to a competing exhibition of a moving panorama, &quot;The Wreck of the Medusa&quot; by the Marshall brothers firm, which was said to have been painted under the direction of one of the survivors of the disaster.

&quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; was championed by the curator of the Louvre, comte de Forbin who purchased it for the museum from Géricault&#x27;s heirs after his death in 1824. The painting now dominates its gallery there. The display caption tells us that &quot;the only hero in this poignant story is humanity&quot;.

At some time between 1826 and 1830 American artist George Cooke (1793–1849) made a copy of the painting in a smaller size, (130.5 x 196.2 cm; approximately 4 ft × 6 ft), which was shown in Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Washington, D.C. to crowds who knew about the controversy surrounding the shipwreck. Reviews favoured the painting, which also stimulated plays, poems, performances and a children&#x27;s book. It was bought by a former admiral, Uriah Phillips, who left it in 1862 to the New York Historical Society, where it was miscatalogued as by Gilbert Stuart and remained inaccessible until the mistake was uncovered in 2006, after an enquiry by Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, a professor of art history at the University of Delaware. The university&#x27;s conservation department undertook restoration of the work.

Because of deterioration in the condition of Géricault&#x27;s original, the Louvre in 1859–60 commissioned two French artists, Pierre-Désiré Guillemet and , to make a full size copy of the original for loan exhibitions.

In the autumn of 1939, the &quot;Medusa&quot; was packed for removal from the Louvre in anticipation of the outbreak of war. A scenery truck from the Comédie-Française transported the painting to Versailles in the night of 3 September. Some time later, the &quot;Medusa&quot; was moved to the Château de Chambord where it remained until after the end of the Second World War.

== Interpretation and legacy ==
In its insistence on portraying an unpleasant truth, &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; was a landmark in the emerging Romantic movement in French painting, and &quot;laid the foundations of an aesthetic revolution&quot; against the prevailing Neoclassical style. Géricault&#x27;s compositional structure and depiction of the figures are classical, but the contrasting turbulence of the subject represents a significant change in artistic direction and creates an important bridge between Neoclassical and Romantic styles. By 1815, Jacques-Louis David, then in exile in Brussels, was both the leading proponent of the popular history painting genre, which he had perfected, and a master of the Neoclassical style. In France, both history painting and the Neoclassical style continued through the work of Antoine-Jean Gros, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, François Gérard, Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson, Pierre-Narcisse Guérin—teacher of both Géricault and Delacroix—and other artists who remained committed to the artistic traditions of David and Nicolas Poussin.

In his introduction to &quot;The Journal of Eugène Delacroix&quot;, Hubert Wellington wrote about Delacroix&#x27;s opinion of the state of French painting just prior to the Salon of 1819. According to Wellington, &quot;The curious blend of classic with realistic outlook which had been imposed by the discipline of David was now losing both animation and interest. The master himself was nearing his end, and exiled in Belgium. His most docile pupil, Girodet, a refined and cultivated classicist, was producing pictures of astonishing frigidity. Gérard, immensely successful painter of portraits under the Empire—some of them admirable—fell in with the new vogue for large pictures of history, but without enthusiasm.&quot;

&quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; contains the gestures and grand scale of traditional history painting; however, it presents ordinary people, rather than heroes, reacting to the unfolding drama. Géricault&#x27;s raft pointedly lacks a hero, and his painting presents no cause beyond sheer survival. The work represents, in the words of Christine Riding, &quot;the fallacy of hope and pointless suffering, and at worst, the basic human instinct to survive, which had superseded all moral considerations and plunged civilised man into barbarism&quot;.

The artist&#x27;s abolitionist views are said to have been expressed in his decision to prominently feature at least two Black individuals, particularly the dominant figure seen waving a dark red handkerchief. According to scholars Klaus Berger and Diane Chalmers Johnson, Géricault made &quot;him the focal point of the drama, the strongest and most perceptive of the survivors, in a sense, the &#x27;hero of the scene. They argue that the artist&#x27;s choice to do so was not a &quot;last-minute&quot; decision as evidenced by early sketches for the work, including a portrait study of the Haitian model Joseph, and point to Géricault&#x27;s concerns regarding the &quot;extreme cruelties&quot; of illegal slave trade in the French colonies. Depicting a Black figure as a hero to convey an abolitionist message was uncommon at the time, as the official symbol of the French abolitionist group, the &quot;Société des amis des Noirs&quot;, was an emblem, originally created by Josiah Wedgewood, titled “Am I Not a Man and a Brother?” (or “Ne suis-je pas ton frere?”) that depicts a Black man begging on one knee for liberation. Scholar Susan Libby highlights how this trope of a helpless, subservient slave became commonplace in European art. Gericault’s choice to place the Black man as the active “hero” deviated from popular ideas about enslaved people. The subject of marine tragedy was undertaken by J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851), who, like many English artists, probably saw Géricault&#x27;s painting when it was exhibited in London in 1820. His &quot;A Disaster at Sea&quot; () chronicled a similar incident, this time a British catastrophe, with a swamped vessel and dying figures also placed in the foreground. Placing a person of color in the centre of the drama was revisited by Turner, with similar abolitionist overtones, in his &quot;The Slave Ship&quot; (1840).

The unblemished musculature of the central figure waving to the rescue ship is reminiscent of the Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications of the extent to which Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.

Hubert Wellington said that while Delacroix was a lifelong admirer of Gros, the dominating enthusiasm of his youth was for Géricault. The dramatic composition of Géricault, with its strong contrasts of tone and unconventional gestures, stimulated Delacroix to trust his own creative impulses on a large work. Delacroix said, &quot;Géricault allowed me to see his &quot;Raft of Medusa&quot; while he was still working on it.&quot; The painting&#x27;s influence is seen in Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;The Barque of Dante&quot; (1822) and reappears as inspiration in Delacroix&#x27;s later works, such as &quot;The Shipwreck of Don Juan&quot; (1840).

According to Wellington, Delacroix&#x27;s masterpiece of 1830, &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;, springs directly from Géricault&#x27;s &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; and Delacroix&#x27;s own &quot;Massacre at Chios&quot;. Wellington wrote that &quot;While Géricault carried his interest in actual detail to the point of searching for more survivors from the wreck as models, Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic inventions.&quot;

The art historian Albert Elsen believed that &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; and Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;Massacre at Chios&quot; provided the inspiration for the grandiose sweep of Auguste Rodin&#x27;s monumental sculpture &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot;. He wrote that &quot;Delacroix&#x27;s &quot;Massacre at Chios&quot; and Géricault&#x27;s &quot;Raft of the Medusa&quot; confronted Rodin on a heroic scale with the innocent nameless victims of political tragedies ... If Rodin was inspired to rival Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Last Judgment&quot;, he had Géricault&#x27;s &quot;Raft of the Medusa&quot; in front of him for encouragement.&quot;

While Gustave Courbet (1819–1877) could be described as an anti-Romantic painter, his major works like &quot;A Burial at Ornans&quot; (1849–50) and &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Studio&quot; (1855) owe a debt to &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;. The influence is not only in Courbet&#x27;s enormous scale, but in his willingness to portray ordinary people and current political events, and to record people, places and events in real, everyday surroundings. The 2004 exhibition at the Clark Art Institute, &quot;Bonjour Monsieur Courbet: The Bruyas Collection from the Musee Fabre, Montpellier&quot;, sought to compare the 19th-century Realist painters Courbet, Honoré Daumier (1808–1879), and early Édouard Manet (1832–1883) with artists associated with Romanticism, including Géricault and Delacroix. Citing &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; as an instrumental influence on Realism, the exhibition drew comparisons between all of the artists. The critic Michael Fried sees Manet directly borrowing the figure of the man cradling his son for the composition of &quot;Angels at the Tomb of Christ&quot;.

The influence of &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; was felt by artists beyond France. Francis Danby, a British painter born in Ireland, probably was inspired by Géricault&#x27;s picture when he painted &quot;Sunset at Sea after a Storm&quot; in 1824, and wrote in 1829 that &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; was &quot;the finest and grandest historical picture I have ever seen&quot;.

&quot;The Gulf Stream&quot; (1899), by the American artist Winslow Homer (1836–1910), replicates the composition of &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; with a damaged vessel, ominously surrounded by sharks and threatened by a waterspout. Like Géricault, Homer makes a black man the pivotal figure in the scene, though here he is the vessel&#x27;s sole occupant. A ship in the distance mirrors the &quot;Argus&quot; from Géricault&#x27;s painting. The move from the drama of Romanticism to the new Realism is exemplified by the stoic resignation of Homer&#x27;s figure. The man&#x27;s condition, which in earlier works might have been characterised by hope or helplessness, has turned to &quot;sullen rage&quot;.

In the early 1990s, the American sculptor John Connell, in his &quot;Raft Project&quot;, a collaborative project with painter Eugene Newmann, recreated &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; by making life-sized sculptures out of wood, paper and tar and placing them on a large wooden raft.

Remarking on the contrast between the dying figures in the foreground and the figures in the mid-ground waving towards the approaching rescue ship, the French art historian Georges-Antoine Borias wrote that Géricault&#x27;s painting represents, &quot;on the one hand, desolation and death. On the other, hope and life.&quot;

For Kenneth Clark, &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; &quot;remains the chief example of romantic pathos expressed through the nude; and that obsession with death, which drove Géricault to frequent mortuary chambers and places of public execution, gives truth to his figures of the dead and the dying. Their outlines may be taken from the classics, but they have been seen again with a craving for violent experience.&quot;

Today, a bronze bas-relief of &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; by Antoine Étex adorns Géricault&#x27;s grave in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

<text>Auberon Alexander Waugh ( ; 17 November 1939 – 16 January 2001) was a British journalist and novelist, and eldest son of the novelist Evelyn Waugh. He was widely known by his nickname &quot;Bron&quot;. 

After a traditional classical education at Downside School, he was commissioned in the army during National Service, where he was badly injured in a shooting accident. He went on to study for a year at Oxford University.

At twenty, he launched his journalism career at the Telegraph Group, and also wrote for many other publications including &quot;Private Eye&quot;, in which he presented a profile that was half Tory grandee and half cheeky rebel. As a young man, Waugh wrote five well-received novels, but gave up fiction for fear of unfavourable comparisons with his father.

He and his wife Lady Teresa had four children and lived at Combe Florey House in Somerset.

== Origins ==
Waugh was born at Pixton Park, near Dulverton in Somerset, his mother&#x27;s ancestral home. He was the eldest son of the novelist Evelyn Waugh, grandson of the author and publisher Arthur Waugh and nephew of Alec Waugh. His mother was Laura Herbert, his father&#x27;s second wife, a daughter of Colonel Aubrey Herbert (1880–1923) of Pixton, diplomat and traveller, a younger son of Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, of Highclere Castle in Hampshire, a leading member of the Conservative Party, by his second wife Elizabeth Howard, a great-niece of Bernard Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk, and a sister of Esmé Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Penrith, ambassador to the United States. Laura&#x27;s half-uncle was George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, the famous Egyptologist who sponsored Howard Carter who discovered King Tutankhamen&#x27;s tomb, and her mother was Hon. Mary Gertrude Vesey, only child and sole heiress of John Vesey, 4th Viscount de Vesci (1844–1903).

He was named after Auberon Herbert (1922–1974), his mother&#x27;s brother, a landowner and advocate of Eastern European causes after World War II, himself named after Auberon Herbert (1838–1906), a son of the 3rd Earl of Carnarvon. His nickname used by friends and family was &quot;Bron&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born just as World War II broke out, Waugh hardly saw his father until he was five. His parents being Roman Catholics (his mother by birth and his father by conversion), he was educated at the Benedictine Downside School in Somerset and passed his Greek and Latin A-level exams at the early age of fifteen. He went on to begin a philosophy, politics, and economics degree at Christ Church, Oxford, where he held an exhibition in English. He was rusticated by the academic authorities, and never returned to the university, preferring to make an early start in journalism.

== Career ==
During his National Service, he was commissioned into the Royal Horse Guards and served in Cyprus, where he was almost killed in a machine gun accident. Annoyed by a fault in the machine gun on his armoured car which he drove frequently, he seized the end of the barrel and shook it, accidentally triggering the mechanism so that the gun fired several bullets through his chest. As a result of his injuries, he lost his spleen, one lung, several ribs, and a finger, and suffered from pain and recurring infections for the rest of his life. While lying on the ground waiting for an ambulance, his troop sergeant kept him alive by providing vital first aid. He was first treated for his injuries at Nicosia General Hospital. While recuperating from the accident in Italy, he began his first novel, &quot;The Foxglove Saga&quot;.

== Journalism ==
Waugh began his career in journalism during 1960 as a cub reporter on Peterborough, the social/gossip column of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

His early work as political columnist on &quot;The Spectator&quot; coincided with the war in Biafra, a mainly Catholic province that had tried to secede from Nigeria. Waugh strongly criticised Harold Wilson&#x27;s government, especially the foreign secretary Michael Stewart, for colluding in the use of mass starvation as a political weapon. He was sacked from &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1970, but with the support of Bernard Levin and others, he won damages for unfair dismissal in a subsequent action.

He was opposed to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and criticised the Church that emerged from it. He was often critical of Archbishops Basil Hume and Derek Worlock.

He also wrote for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;British Medicine&quot; and various newspapers (including the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;). From 1981 to 1990 he wrote a leader-page column for &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. In 1990 he returned to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as the successor of Michael Wharton (better known as &quot;Peter Simple&quot;), writing the paper&#x27;s long-running &quot;Way of the World&quot; column three times a week until December 2000. In 1995 he finally ended his long association with &quot;The Spectator&quot;, but in 1996 he rejoined &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, where he remained a weekly columnist until shortly before his death.

== &quot;Private Eye&quot; ==
Waugh became known for his &quot;Private Eye&quot; diary, which ran from the early 1970s until 1985, and which he described as &quot;specifically dedicated to telling lies&quot;. He fitted in well with the &quot;Eye&quot;, although he made clear his particular dislike of the Labour government of the 1970s. The education secretary Shirley Williams became an especial hate figure because of her support for comprehensive education. In his autobiography &quot;Will This Do?&quot;, Waugh claimed that he had broken two bottles of wine by banging them together too hard to celebrate when she lost her House of Commons seat at Hertford and Stevenage in the general election of 1979.

Waugh was himself a candidate at the 1979 election, indulging another of his pet hates, former Liberal Leader Jeremy Thorpe, who was about to stand trial for conspiracy to murder in a scandal that Waugh had helped to expose. It was alleged that Thorpe had links to an incident in which a man called Norman Scott, who claimed to have had an affair with Thorpe, had seen his dog shot dead. Waugh stood against Thorpe for the Dog Lovers&#x27; Party in North Devon, and Thorpe obtained an injunction against the distribution of Waugh&#x27;s election literature; but despite this &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; both printed it in full. Waugh polled only 79 votes, but Thorpe lost his seat.

Waugh left &quot;Private Eye&quot; in 1986 when Ian Hislop succeeded Richard Ingrams as editor.

== Waugh&#x27;s views ==
Waugh tended to be identified with a defiantly anti-progressive, small-c conservatism, opposed to &quot;do-gooders&quot; and social progressives. After his death the left-wing journalist Polly Toynbee in &quot;The Guardian&quot; attacked him for these views. He has been called a nostalgist and a romantic, with a strong tendency towards snobbery, although his anarchistic streak ensured that he retained the admiration of a number of people whom he would have considered &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;leftish&quot;, including Francis Wheen, who vociferously disagreed with Toynbee&#x27;s obituary comments.

Waugh expressed an intense dislike of poet Ezra Pound. In a &quot;Spectator&quot; column of 20 March 1976, he wrote: &quot;Ezra Pound, as I remember, wrote some disgusting lines about storm clouds over Westminster in his &quot;Cantos&quot;. I haven&#x27;t looked at them for twenty-one years and certainly don&#x27;t intend to look them up again now. Ever since I was fifteen when I first read Pound&#x27;s boring filth, the thought of storm clouds over Westminster has filled me with nausea and gloom.&quot; In a letter dated 15 January 1973, writer Guy Davenport reported, &quot;Auberon Waugh in the English press giggled over Ez&#x27;s demise [1 November 1972], informing his audience that Pound&#x27;s silly verse was so much twaddle, and his example the cause of Modern Poetry and all its vulgar pretense. He also confesses that he immensely enjoyed torturing Pound in the madhouse with letters asking what passages in &quot;The Cantos&quot; might mean. Pound&#x27;s replies, tedious and lengthy, he destroyed after having his laugh.&quot;

Waugh broadly supported Margaret Thatcher in her first years as prime minister, but by 1983 he became disillusioned by the government&#x27;s economic policy, which he felt used the destructive economics and cultural ideas of the New Right. When Thatcher became a strong public opponent of his friend and &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; editor Peregrine Worsthorne, Waugh became a staunch opponent of Thatcher. Her closeness to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;″ editor Andrew Neil, whom Waugh despised, further confirmed his view.

To a traditional Tory, these were some of the most deplorable aspects of the Thatcher years. There was a certain amount of public posturing in his popular anti-Americanism; he visited the US whenever he could, and spent notable time holidaying in New England and on US speaking tours.

He had a house in France and, despite his conservatism, was a fervent supporter of European integration and the single currency, which he saw as a means of de-Americanising the UK. He said that his ideal government would be a &quot;junta of Belgian ticket inspectors&quot;. Neither did he conform to reactionary stereotypes in his strong opposition to the death penalty, or in his antipathy towards the police force in general (especially when they sought to prevent drink-driving; Waugh believed strongly that this was not as serious a problem as it is widely believed to be, and referred to the anti-drink-driving campaign as the &quot;police terror&quot;). He opposed anti-tobacco smoking legislation and in his later years he was highly critical of Labour attempts to ban fox hunting. In 1995 he was against attempts by the then Home Secretary Michael Howard to introduce a national identity card, a policy which at the time was opposed by the Labour Party. Along with Patrick Marnham and Richard West, Waugh was one of three signatories to a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; that called for a British monument to honour those repatriated as a result of the Yalta Conference; it was eventually erected in 1986.

Waugh held that while the dangers of smoking (especially passive smoking) and drinking were exaggerated, the dangers of hamburger eating were seriously under-reported; he frequently referred to &quot;hamburger gases&quot; as a serious form of atmospheric pollution and even made references to the dangers of &quot;passive hamburger eating&quot;. He also claimed that computer games &quot;produce all the symptoms and most known causes of cancer&quot;. The Tobacco Advisory Council of the UK organised a pro-smoking book to be ghosted for either Bernard Levin or Auberon Waugh. Neither columnist agreed to put their name to it, but Waugh wrote a foreword endorsing the book and hitting out at the anti-smoking lobby: &quot;Let us hope this book strikes a blow against the new control terrorists&quot;, he said. He also posed for photos with a cigarette in his hand.

== Family ==
In 1961, Auberon Waugh married Lady Teresa Onslow, daughter of the 6th Earl of Onslow. They had four children:
* Margaret Sophia Laura Waugh (b. 1962)
* Alexander Evelyn Michael Waugh (30 December 1963 – 22 July 2024)
* Daisy Louisa Dominica Waugh (b. 1967)
* Nathaniel Thomas Biafra Waugh (b. 1968)

They lived at the Old Rectory, Chilton Foliat, Wiltshire, from 1964 to 1971, then moved into Waugh&#x27;s father&#x27;s old home, Combe Florey House in Somerset.

== Literary career ==
Waugh wrote five novels before giving up writing fiction, partly in protest at the inadequate money authors received from public lending rights at libraries and partly because he knew he would always be compared unfavourably to his father. The five novels are:
* &quot;The Foxglove Saga&quot; (1960)
* &quot;Path of Dalliance&quot; (1963)
* &quot;Who Are The Violets Now?&quot; (1965)
* &quot;Consider the Lilies&quot; (1968)
* &quot;A Bed of Flowers&quot; (1972).

He also wrote a book about the Thorpe case, &quot;The Last Word&quot;, and a book about Biafra, &quot;Biafra: Britain&#x27;s Shame&quot;, co-written with Suzanne Cronje. He made several programmes for ATV in the 1970s.

In 1986, his critical book &quot;Another Voice – An Alternative Anatomy of Britain&quot; () was published and was well received. From that year until his death he also edited the &quot;Literary Review&quot; magazine, where he organised awards for what he called &quot;real&quot; (rhyming and scanning) poetry, and also a Bad Sex Award for the worst description of sex in a novel.

Two collections of Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Private Eye&quot; diary have been published: &quot;Four Crowded Years: The Diaries of Auberon Waugh 1972–1976&quot; (Deutsch/Private Eye, 1976), and &quot;A Turbulent Decade: The Diaries of Auberon Waugh 1976–1985&quot; (Private Eye, 1985).

In 1991, he was interviewed by Anthony Howard for the Thames TV documentary &quot;Waugh Memorial&quot;.

Waugh opined on many and various topics. For example, in a leader piece for the &quot;Literary Review&quot; in 1991 he commented upon sceptic James Randi&#x27;s dismissal on British television of the supposed art of dowsing for water. Waugh noted that, although he had no great interest in the subject, he lived in a house which had a well sunk through 70 ft (21 m) of rock on nothing more than the advice of a dowser.

== Death ==

Waugh&#x27;s health declined considerably throughout the final months of his life, and died from heart failure at Combe Florey House on 16 January 2001, at the age of 61. He is buried in the graveyard of the Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul, Combe Florey.

<text>ENT Ltd, standing for Examiner-Northern TV Ltd, is a private shell company owned by WIN Corporation. Formerly a publicly listed media company, from 1988 ENT had a majority share in Filmpac Holdings (formerly Filmways Australasian Distributors), a film and video distributor. Filmpac collapsed in 1990, and in 1994 ENT was taken over by WIN after major shareholder Edmund Rouse was involved in a bribery scandal.

==History==
ENT Ltd was a publicly listed Australian media company based in Launceston, Tasmania run by major shareholder Edmund Rouse. ENT&#x27;s 1988 annual report described the company&#x27;s principal activities as television, newspapers, radio, commercial printing, motels, travel agencies, picture theatres, property development, and investment.

In 1994, a bribery scandal led to Rouse stepping down as managing director of ENT Ltd, which was taken over by WIN Corporation.

===Filmpac===
Filmways Australasian Distributors was originally formed by the founders of Dendy Cinemas, Mark Josem and Robert Ward, in 1971, to release movies to the Australian market. Mark Josem died in 1986 after a series of heart attacks from a surgery the previous year, and the company was renamed Filmpac Holdings soon afterwards.

Filmpac Holdings was a distributor of both films and videos. ENT acquired a 40 per cent stake in 1988 from its purchase of Victoria-based media company Associated Broadcasting Services. 

Filmways/Filmpac also had a home video division on its own under the name Filmways Home Video, starting with a deal with Video Classics, then as a partnership with Video Tape Centre under the name &#x27;Filmways VTC, with K-TEL Video distributing the titles from 1984 to 1985, and Vestron Video International distributing titles by Filmways Home Video/Filmpac from 1985 to 1988 before it became an independent video distributor for two years. Both Vestron and Filmways were Video Classics members before the K-TEL alliance.

Between 1986 and 1990, Filmpac released a total of 69 films theatrically, making it the country&#x27;s largest independent mainstream theatrical distributor. The company collapsed in 1990, with its film library purchased by Village Roadshow, along with certain assets from another defunct distributor Seven Keys.

<text>John DeChancie (born August 3, 1946) is an American author. A Pittsburgh native, he is most famous for his comic fantasy &quot;Castle&quot; series, and his science fiction &quot;Skyway&quot; series. He is currently engaged in writing screenplays, teleplays, and prose fiction.

== The &quot;Castle Perilous&quot; Series ==

The &quot;Castle Perilous&quot; series revolves around Castle Perilous (the name is drawn from the Siege Perilous of Arthurian fable), whose lord is Incarnadine, a sorcerer. 144,000 doors (or &quot;aspects&quot;) of the Castle each lead to another parallel universe. Some of these dimensions are magical, while others have little or no magic; one of the latter is Earth. Those who find themselves at the Castle often stay to become residents, and (to their surprise) develop a magical power of their own. This gift is apparently random, and can range from a minor telekinesis limited to lifting pencils to super-enhanced senses to teleportation to full conjuration of matter. The main character, a philosophy major from Earth named Gene Ferraro, gains the power of superb swordplay. His best friends include Snowclaw, a giant humanoid covered in white fur, who originally comes from a polar-like clime, and Linda Barclay, a woman from Earth who becomes a powerful sorceress.

== The &quot;Skyway&quot; Series ==

The &quot;Skyway&quot; series differs from the &quot;Castle&quot; series significantly; where the &quot;Castle&quot; series is humorous fantasy, the &quot;Skyway&quot; series is action-adventure science fiction. The &quot;Skyway&quot; series traces the adventures of Jake McGraw, who drives a futuristic cargo truck on the Skyway. The Skyway itself is a mysterious road, built by an unknown race of aliens, which runs across various planets from one portal to another. Driving through a portal (a &quot;tollbooth&quot;) instantaneously transports you onto a different planet, many light years away. Humans found the Skyway on Pluto and began expanding along it, encountering various alien races along the way. However no one has a map, or knows where the Skyway begins or ends, and because each portal is one-way, only explored sections with a known return path (discovered by trial and error) are considered safe to travel.

At the beginning of the first book Jake finds himself in trouble because a number of parties, both human and alien, are convinced that he has found a map. Some are willing to kill to get it. Jake knows that he does not have a map, but no one believes him. At this point Jake is accompanied only by his father, Sam, who is actually dead but has been &quot;converted&quot; into an artificial intelligence unit that is built into the truck. The truck itself is a large tractor trailer unit, powered by nuclear fusion and capable of operating in a vacuum. The truck&#x27;s cab can hold 8 or more people and has built-in bunks for sleeping. At the beginning of the first book Jake stops to pick up a hitchhiker (the beautiful and mysterious Darla), which is the beginning of a trend: over the course of the trilogy more and more people are riding with Jake while more and more people are also pursuing him. By the end of the trilogy Jake and his companions have reached the end of the Skyway, met with the beings that created it, and returned months earlier than when they left, bringing the trilogy to a conclusion.

<text>World in Action is a British investigative current affairs programme made by Granada Television for ITV from 7 January 1963 until 7 December 1998. Its campaigning journalism frequently had a major impact on events of the day. Its production teams often took audacious risks, and the programme gained a solid reputation for its often-unorthodox approach. The series was sold around the world and won numerous awards. In its heyday, &quot;World in Action&quot; drew audiences of up to 23 million in Britain alone, equivalent to almost half the population.

Cabinet ministers fell to its probings. Numerous innocent victims of the British criminal justice system, including the Birmingham Six, were released from jail. Honouring the programme in its 50th anniversary awards the Political Studies Association said, &quot;&quot;World in Action&quot; thrived on unveiling corruption and highlighting underhand dealings. &quot;World in Action&quot; came to be seen as hard-hitting investigative journalism at its best.&quot; A melodramatic post-trial encounter in 1967 between Mick Jagger and senior British establishment figures, in which the rock star and his retinue were flown by helicopter onto the lawn of a stately home, was engineered by then &quot;World in Action&quot; researcher and future BBC Director-General John Birt. Decades later, Birt himself described it as &quot;one of the iconic moments of the Sixties.&quot; Soon after she became Conservative Party leader, Margaret Thatcher was said to have told the BBC Director-General, Sir Ian Trethowan, that she considered &quot;World in Action&quot; to consist of &quot;just a lot of Trots. &quot;Panorama&quot;, however, are bastards.&quot;

Its removal after 35 years was seen by some as part of a general dumbing down of British television and of ITV in particular. One commercial TV regulatory official privately characterised the &quot;Tonight&quot; programme, which replaced it, as merely &quot;fluffy&quot;. Others saw &quot;World in Action&#x27;s&quot; eventual disappearance as the inevitable consequence of rising commercial pressures. Announcing a £250,000 fund for an investigative journalism training scheme, Channel Four said in November 2011 that a decline in the pool of investigative journalism had occurred since &quot;the demise of training grounds such as &quot;World in Action&quot;&quot;.

==Origins==
&quot;World in Action&quot; was the pre-eminent current-affairs programme produced by Britain&#x27;s ITV Network in its first 50 years. Along with &quot;This Week&quot;, &quot;Weekend World&quot;, &quot;TV Eye&quot;, &quot;First Tuesday&quot;, &quot;The Big Story&quot;, and &quot;The Cook Report&quot; – and the news-gathering of ITN – &quot;World in Action&quot; gave ITV a reputation for quality broadcast journalism to rival the BBC&#x27;s output.

For the first 35 years of its existence, ITV had a near-monopoly of television advertising revenue. Roy Thomson, who ran Scottish Television, famously described ITV as a &quot;licence to print money&quot;. In return for this income, the broadcasting regulator insisted that the ITV companies broadcast a proportion of their programmes as public-service TV. Out of this was born the network&#x27;s reputation for serious current affairs, eagerly grabbed by programme makers under Granada&#x27;s founder, Lord Sidney Bernstein.

Some of the most prominent figures in 20th-century British broadcasting helped to create &quot;World in Action&quot;, in particular, Tim Hewat, &quot;the maverick genius of Granada&#x27;s current affairs in its formative years&quot;, and David Plowright, but also Jeremy Isaacs, Michael Parkinson, John Birt, and Gus Macdonald and its most long-serving executive producer, Ray Fitzwalter. The series developed the skills of generations of journalists, and in particular, filmmakers. Michael Apted worked on the original &quot;Seven Up!&quot;. Paul Greengrass, who spent 10 years on &quot;World in Action&quot;, told the BBC: &quot;My first dream was to work on &quot;World In Action&quot;, to be honest. It was that wonderful eclectic mixture of filmmaking and reportage. That was my training ground. It showed me the world and made me see many things.&quot; He later told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;If there&#x27;s a thread running through my career it&#x27;s &quot;World in Action&quot; – the phrase as well as the programme.&quot;

Although its rivals produced many memorable programmes, &quot;World in Action&quot;;s &quot;slamming into the subject of each edition without wordy prefaces from a reassuring host-figure&quot; consistently gained a reputation for the kind of original journalism and filmmaking that made headlines and won major awards. In its time, the series was honoured by all of the major broadcasting awards, including many BAFTA, the Royal Television Society, and Emmy awards.

&quot;World in Action&#x27;s&quot; style was the opposite to its urbane BBC rivals, especially to the London BBC. By repute, especially in its early days, &quot;World in Action&quot; would never employ anybody who was on first-name terms with any politician. Gus Macdonald, an executive producer of the programme, said it had been &quot;born brash&quot;. Steve Boulton, one of its last editors, wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot; that the programme&#x27;s ethos was to &quot;comfort the afflicted – and afflict the comfortable.&quot; Paul Greengrass told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in June 2008 that the chairman of Granada TV once told him: &quot;Don&#x27;t forget, your job&#x27;s to make trouble.&quot;

The series outlasted all of its contemporaries in ITV current affairs, killed off as the commercial pressures on the network grew with the arrival of multichannel TV in the UK. Eventually, &quot;World In Action&quot;, too, was removed from the schedules by its own creator, Granada TV. On 7 December 1998, &quot;World in Action &quot;ceased operations for good after 35 years on air. It was replaced in the schedules by &quot;Tonight&quot;.

==Investigative legacy==
From the beginning, and especially from the late 1960s, &quot;World in Action&quot; broke new ground in investigative techniques. Landmark investigations included the Poulson affair, corruption in the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad, the exposure of the shadowy and violent far-right group Combat 18, investigations into L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology, and most notably, a long campaign that resulted in the release from prison of the Birmingham Six, six Irishmen falsely accused of planting Provisional Irish Republican Army bombs in Birmingham pubs.

&quot;World in Action&#x27;s&quot; appetite for controversy created tension with the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the official regulator during most of the series&#x27;s run, which had the power to intervene before broadcast. Sir Denis Forman, one of Granada&#x27;s founders, wrote that &quot;trench warfare&quot; existed between the programme and the industry regulator, the Independent Television Authority, in the years between 1966 and 1969 as &quot;World in Action&quot; sought to establish its journalistic freedoms.

The most celebrated dispute was in 1973, over the banning of &quot;The Friends and Influence of John L Poulson&quot;, the definitive film about the Poulson affair, itself one of the defining scandals of British political life in the 1960s. Poulson was an architect, who was jailed a year later for corrupting politicians and civil servants to advance his construction business. The regulator, which was then the IBA, banned the film without seeing it and without giving official reasons other than &quot;broadcasting policy&quot;. As a protest, Granada broadcast a blank screen – which, bizarrely, recorded the third-highest TV audience of that week. After a public furor, which saw newspapers from the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; to the &quot;Socialist Worker&quot; unite in condemnation of &quot;censorship&quot;, the IBA held a second vote, having by then seen the film. By a single vote, the ban was lifted and the programme, by then retitled &quot;The Rise and Fall of John Poulson&quot;, was transmitted on 30 April 1973, three months after it was first scheduled.

In January 1980, the programme examined the business practices of the then chairman of Manchester United football club, Louis Edwards. Edwards ran a wholesale butchery business that supplied schools in Manchester; &quot;WIA&quot; exposed practices of bribery of council officials and the supply of meat that was unfit for human consumption to such institutions; Edwards&#x27; businesses were subsequently prosecuted and lost their contracts. Louis Edwards himself died of a heart attack a month after the show was broadcast.

&quot;World in Action&quot; tackled the British intelligence services, as well as the Royal Navy, over their recruitment practices; senior navy personnel famously door-stepped the director of &quot;World in Action&quot;&#x27;s film in question. The programme broadcast revelations by whistleblowers from both GCHQ, the government&#x27;s electronic eavesdropping and surveillance headquarters, and from the Joint Intelligence Committee.

Its most audacious investigation of the intelligence community was, perhaps, an extended edition in July 1984 titled &quot;The Spy Who Never Was&quot;, the confessions of a former MI5 officer, Peter Wright. &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, Wright&#x27;s subsequent account of the period when his colleagues and he had, as he put it, &quot;bugged and burgled our way across London&quot;, revealed what had in effect been a planned coup against the then-Labour government of Harold Wilson. Wright appeared to have been in charge of the technical side of things. &quot;The Wilson plot&quot;, as it became known, was corroborated to varying degrees both before and after the film&#x27;s transmission in various other books by journalists and in volumes of memoirs by others involved in the conspiracy. Wright&#x27;s book was the most explosive of them all. Wright, embittered by a still-unresolved pension dispute, fled to Australia, where the book was written and finally published – to the fury of Margaret Thatcher – with the assistance of the original programme&#x27;s chief researcher, Paul Greengrass. Publication in Britain was initially banned outright by the government of Margaret Thatcher.

The series was rarely away from the courts and the threat of legal action. The Scientologists tried – and failed – to stop &quot;World in Action&quot;&#x27;s broadcasts about them through the courts, and in 1980, members of the programme&#x27;s staff and senior executives at Granada TV announced that they would be prepared to go to prison rather than submit to a House of Lords ruling that the programme reveal the identity of an informant who had supplied &quot;WIA&quot; with 250 pages of secret documents from the then-state-owned British Steel Corporation which was at the time locked in an industrial dispute with its workforce.

In 1995, Susan O&#x27;Keeffe, a &quot;World in Action&quot; journalist, was threatened with prison in Ireland for refusing to reveal her sources. She had investigated scandals within the Irish meat industry in two films in 1991, setting in motion a three-year Tribunal of Inquiry in Dublin, which found that much of her criticism of the industry was substantiated. The tribunal, though, demanded that she name her informants, and when she refused to do so, she was charged by the Irish Director of Public Prosecutions. The case became a cause célèbre in the Republic of Ireland, and in January 1995 she faced trial for contempt of court but was cleared of the charge. O&#x27;Keeffe was honoured in the 1994 Freedom of Information Awards for her stand.

In its last few years, the programme was involved in two high-profile libel cases. It won the first (along with &quot;The Guardian&quot;) against the former Conservative cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken, and lost the second, against the high street chain Marks &amp; Spencer.

On 10 April 1995, Aitken, himself a former journalist for Yorkshire Television, called a televised press conference three hours before the transmission of a &quot;World in Action&quot; film, &quot;Jonathan of Arabia&quot;, demanding that allegations about his dealings with leading Saudis be withdrawn. In a phrase that would come to haunt him, Aitken promised to wield &quot;the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of British fair play ... to cut out the cancer of bent and twisted journalism.&quot; Aitken was subsequently sentenced to 18 months in prison for perjuring himself in the resulting libel case. &quot;World in Action&quot; followed the collapse of Aitken&#x27;s libel case with a special edition whose title reflected the MP&#x27;s claim to wield the &quot;sword of truth&quot;. It was called &quot;The Dagger of Deceit&quot;.

==Television techniques==
Although the series&#x27;s lasting reputation is for its investigative work, it also led the way in introducing other techniques to mainstream TV. In 1971, years before the rise of &quot;reality&quot; programmes on TV schedules, &quot;World in Action&quot; challenged the Staffordshire village of Longnor to quit smoking, a forerunner of many of the popular-challenge documentaries that enjoyed success in the 21st-century reality-television boom.

In 1984, &quot;World in Action&quot; caused a sensation by challenging a rising young Conservative Member of Parliament, Matthew Parris, to live for a week on a £26 unemployment benefit payment to test the reality of his own critical views on unemployed people – Parris subsequently abandoned Parliament for a career as a broadcaster and writer. The same year, &quot;World in Action&quot; revealed the tricks behind political oratory by coaching a complete beginner, Ann Brennan, to deliver a speech, which won a standing ovation at the annual conference of the Social Democratic Party, using techniques developed by Professor Max Atkinson. Eminent political commentator Sir Robin Day, covering the conference for BBC television, described Mrs Brennan&#x27;s performance as &quot;[t]he most refreshing speech we&#x27;ve heard so far.&quot;

&quot;World in Action&quot; helped to pioneer the technique of using covert cameras, not just in investigative work, but also in social documentary, including, from the earliest days, the treatment of gypsies, the old in care (&quot;Ward F13&quot;), and poverty in England. The arrival of high-quality miniature cameras allowed ambitious projects such as Donal MacIntyre&#x27;s award-winning programmes in October 1996 on the illegal drug trade, and the future Conservative MP Adam Holloway&#x27;s disturbing reports on the reality of life among the homeless in 1991. In 1998, &quot;World in Action&quot; took advantage of the new technology to equip an entire house with secret cameras hidden in places from coke tins to fish tanks to catch out shoddy builders. The success of the two-part series called &quot;House of Horrors&quot;, produced by Kate Middleton, led not only to the ITV series &quot;House of Horrors&quot; and to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Rogue Traders&quot;, but also to a whole new genre of programming, around the world, based around hidden-camera footage of dodgy tradesmen.

&quot;World in Action&quot; also gave rise to a number of other spin-off series, most famously the &quot;Seven Up!&quot; documentaries that have followed the lives of a group of British people who turned seven years old in 1963. The most recent, &quot;63 UP&quot;, was shown in 2019. Michael Apted directed most episodes; parallel series have also started in South Africa, the US, and Russia.

More recent current-affairs series on other channels, such as the MacIntyre series on BBC and Five, and Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot;, commissioned by Dorothy Byrne, a former &quot;World in Action&quot; producer, may be seen as having inherited certain aspects of &quot;World in Action&quot;&#x27;s hard-hitting journalistic style.

==&quot;World in Action&quot; and popular culture==
One of the programme&#x27;s hallmarks was its willingness to embrace popular culture, at a time when its competitors preferred a more highbrow approach. One of the earliest editions reported on overspending at the Ministry of Defence in the style of a contemporary gameshow, &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;. The programme was so controversial, it was banned from being shown on ITV by the then-regulatory body, the Independent Television Authority; instead, 10 minutes of it were shown on the BBC as an act of journalistic solidarity. The gameshow device re-emerged in 1989, when an academic study of the uptake of tax-funded benefits by the middle class was transformed into a mock quiz show named &quot;Spongers&quot;, fronted by a well-known star of game formats, Nicholas Parsons.

Popular music played a significant role in &quot;WIA&#x27;s&quot; history. An early edition, in 1966, carried a fly-on-the-wall account of daily life aboard one of the then-pirate radio ships, Radio Caroline, at a time when the British government was determined to preserve the radio monopoly of the BBC by driving the &quot;pirates&quot; off the air. In 1964, the show covered the launch of the second pirate radio ship, Radio Atlanta, by putting a film crew on board the radio ship as she sailed into position.

After the offshore radio ships were outlawed, only Radio Caroline&#x27;s two ships continued, so &quot;WIA&quot; visited one of the ships in September 1967. The British government were furious and banned the camera crew from sailing back into the UK at Felixstowe, just a few miles away, forcing them to sail to Holland and then fly back to the UK.

The long-running intermittent &quot;Seven Up!&quot; series of TV films, which in due course spanned decades, was first broadcast from 1964 as part of &quot;World in Action&quot;. By its intimate technique of filming the everyday lives of children and interviewing them, a different picture of life in Britain was formed.

In 1967, a young researcher named John Birt established his early reputation by persuading the rock star Mick Jagger to appear on &quot;World in Action&quot; to debate youth culture and his recent drug conviction, with establishment figures, including William Rees-Mogg of &quot;The Times&quot;, who had written a famous editorial defending the singer. Jagger so enjoyed the experience that he invited the Granada team to film the Rolling Stones at the band&#x27;s free 1969 concert in Hyde Park, London. The resulting film, &quot;The Stones in the Park&quot;, was one of the iconic concert films of the 1960s. John Birt moved on to edit &quot;World in Action&quot;, and eventually became the director-general of the BBC.

The rise of Thatcherism and the misery of mass unemployment had &quot;WIA&quot; examining the phenomenon through the eyes of another emerging band, UB40, in &quot;A Statistic, A Reminder&quot; (1981), a line taken from one of the band&#x27;s songs. Six years later, a special edition of the programme was devoted to the Irish rock band U2 and their charismatic front man Bono. Like the Rolling Stones before them, U2 allowed &quot;World in Action&quot; to film one of their classic concerts in 1987 in Ireland. This footage, shot by future Hollywood director Paul Greengrass, was shown only once on ITV because of copyright restrictions, although it has circulated among fans as a bootleg.

In 1983, Stevie Wonder, at the height of his popularity, gave the programme a musical exclusive when he agreed to let a &quot;World in Action&quot; crew record him performing an unreleased song, written to help Democratic politician Jesse Jackson&#x27;s electioneering, for &quot;The Race Against Reagan&quot;. Another popular singer, Sting, appeared in a more critical &quot;World in Action&quot; episode, which questioned the effectiveness of his Rainforest Foundation. In August 1980, the series devoted an edition to the story behind chart rigging – an ongoing practice where record companies were bribing the British chart compilers to put certain artists&#x27; singles higher in the charts than they actually were. Singles mentioned on the programme included several UK number-one hits of the previous 12 months.

Perhaps the most bruising encounter between &quot;WIA&quot; and popular entertainment was the 1995 film &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, which featured a covert recording of a performance by comedian Bernard Manning as the star of a charity function organised by the Manchester branch of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers. Manning&#x27;s racist and homophobic performance, loudly applauded by those present, caused outrage when &quot;WIA&quot; broadcast excerpts, sparking an intense debate about the willingness of British police officers to embrace a diverse culture. Former &quot;WIA&quot; editor Steve Boulton revealed during a 2013 ITV documentary about &quot;World in Action&quot; that the covert recording had been made by a fellow speaker at the function, former Liverpool Militant politician Derek Hatton, himself a previous target of a &quot;World in Action&quot; investigation. Hatton used a miniature cassette recorder concealed in Boulton&#x27;s own Filofax.

==Leading contributors==

===Journalists===
&quot;World in Action&quot; employed many leading journalists, among them John Pilger; Michael Parkinson; Gordon Burns; Nick Davies, Ed Vulliamy and David Leigh of the &quot;Guardian&quot;; Alasdair Palmer of the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;; John Ware, BBC &quot;Panorama&quot;&#x27;s leading investigative reporter; Tony Wilson, whose second career as a music impresario was immortalised in the feature film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;; Michael Gillard, creator of the &quot;Slicker&quot; business pages in the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;; Donal MacIntyre; the writer Mark Hollingsworth; Quentin McDermott, since 1999 a leading investigative reporter for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; Tony Watson, editor of the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; for 13 years and editor-in-chief of the Press Association from December 2006; and Andrew Jennings, author of &quot;Lords of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Dirty Game&quot;, who has campaigned vigorously for more than a decade against corruption in international sport.

Two former &quot;World in Action&quot; journalists uncovered one of the biggest broadcasting scandals of the 1990s. Laurie Flynn, a central figure in the British Steel papers case, and Michael Sean Gillard revealed that large parts of a 1996 Carlton Television documentary, &quot;The Connection&quot;, about drug trafficking from Colombia, had been fabricated.
Flynn and Gillard&#x27;s exposé in &quot;the Guardian&quot; in May 1998 led to an inquiry and a record £2 million fine for Carlton from the then-regulator, the Independent Television Commission, as well as provoking a passionate debate about truthfulness in broadcast journalism.

===Presenters===
Unusually for a current-affairs programme, &quot;WIA&#x27;s&quot; standard format was as a voice-over documentary without a regular reporter, although a handful of &quot;WIA&quot; journalists did appear in front of camera, including Chris Kelly, Gordon Burns, John Pilger, Gus Macdonald, Nick Davies, Adam Holloway, Stuart Prebble (who later became the programme&#x27;s editor), Mike Walsh, David Taylor, Donal MacIntyre, and Granada Reports journalist and Factory Records supremo Tony Wilson, who became the show&#x27;s first in-vision anchor in the early 1980s. Guest presenters were used on rare occasions, among them Jonathan Dimbleby, Sandy Gall, Martyn Gregory, Sue Lawley, and Lynn Faulds Wood. Perhaps its most celebrated guest presenter was distinguished American anchorman Walter Cronkite, who came out of retirement to cover the 1983 UK general election for the series.

A small group of narrators delivered the vast majority of &quot;WIA&#x27;s&quot; voice-overs. The two original narrators were Derek Cooper, later to become well known as a broadcaster and writer about food, and Wilfrid Thomas. The science presenter. James Burke, did a number of commentaries on early editions of the programme. Other major contributors included David Plowright, Chris Kelly, Jim Pope, Philip Tibenham, and Andrew Brittain. Among the guest narrators who contributed occasional commentaries were popular actors Robert Lindsay and Jean Boht.

===Producer-directors===
The series was known for its gritty visual style, almost always shot on location, and a number of its producer-directors went on to work on major film projects. Those working on the series in its early years included Michael Apted, later to direct &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot;, and the James Bond film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, as well as the &quot;Up Series&quot; documentaries (the earliest programmes were part of the &quot;WIA&quot; series), and Mike Hodges, who went on to direct &quot;Get Carter&quot; and &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. Director John Goldschmidt made several films for the series in the early 1970s. Later, Paul Greengrass, director of the feature films &quot;United 93&quot;, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;, and &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; and of the drama-documentaries &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; and &quot;The Murder of Stephen Lawrence&quot;, cut his directing teeth on &quot;World in Action&quot;. Leslie Woodhead, director of &quot;The Stones in the Park&quot;, the award-winning &quot;A Cry From The Grave&quot;, many &quot;Disappearing World&quot; films and also regarded by many as a founder of the drama-documentary movement, worked on &quot;World in Action&quot; for many years as a producer-director and executive. Long-time &quot;World in Action&quot; alumni who went on to direct and produce Granada&#x27;s international award-winning &quot;Disappearing World&quot; films include Brian Moser, its instigator and original producer, and Charlie Nairn.

Among the more recent generation of filmmakers to emerge from &quot;World in Action&quot; were Alex Holmes, who became editor of the BBC2 documentary strand &quot;Modern Times&quot; and went on to write and direct the BAFTA-winning dramatised documentary series &quot;Dunkirk&quot; for the BBC and &quot;House of Saddam&quot; for the BBC and HBO; and Katy Jones, a former &quot;WIA&quot; producer who became a key collaborator with the screenwriter Jimmy McGovern as a producer on the drama-documentaries &quot;Hillsborough&quot; (1996) and &quot;Sunday&quot; (2002).

===Broadcasters===
&quot;WIA&quot; was a starting point for several key programme-makers who went on to major roles in British broadcasting. John Birt became director-general of the BBC, having been programme controller of the ITV station London Weekend Television, where he created the current-affairs flagship, &quot;Weekend World&quot;.

Several &quot;WIA&quot; staffers were promoted to significant roles in Granada Television, among them David Plowright, who became its chairman and later went on to become deputy chairman of Channel 4. Steve Morrison became chief executive at Granada. Gus Macdonald held the same role at another ITV franchise, Scottish Television.

Stuart Prebble, a former editor, became chief executive of ITV, and Steve Anderson became head of news and current affairs for that channel. Both have since moved on to the independent production industry. Ian McBride, who led the team that made the Birmingham Six programmes, became managing editor of Granada TV, and was director of compliance for ITV until 2008.

Dianne Nelmes, who worked as a researcher and executive producer of &quot;WIA&quot;, was the founding editor of Granada TV&#x27;s hugely successful &quot;This Morning with Richard and Judy&quot; and went on to head daytime and factual programmes at ITV.

Dorothy Byrne, a former &quot;WIA&quot; producer, went on to become head of news and current affairs at Channel 4. Julian Bellamy, who worked as a young researcher on one of &quot;WIA&#x27;s&quot; last big foreign investigations – about arms deals between Britain and Indonesia – later headed Channel 4&#x27;s entertainment channel E4 and was programme controller of the BBC digital channel BBC Three before rejoining Channel 4 as its head of programming from 2007 to 2011. In 2012, Bellamy was appointed creative director of Discovery International.

===TV production companies===
A number of &quot;WIA&quot; veterans went on to set up and run their own independent television production companies. John Smithson and David Darlow, who set up the production company Darlow Smithson, responsible for the feature films &quot;Touching the Void&quot; and &quot;Deep Water&quot; and many factual TV programmes including &quot;Black Box&quot; and &quot;The Falling Man&quot;, worked together on &quot;WIA&quot;. Claudia Milne founded twentytwenty TV, which made a successful current-affairs strand for ITV, &quot;The Big Story&quot;, as well as popular factual series such as &quot;Bad Boys&#x27; Army&quot;&#x27; on ITV and &quot;That&#x27;ll Teach &#x27;Em&quot; on Channel 4. Brian Lapping set up the much-garlanded Brook Lapping company, which made &quot;The Death of Yugoslavia&quot; and many other landmark contemporary history programmes. Stuart Prebble, a former editor of &quot;World in Action&quot;, runs Liberty Bell, best known for the popular &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; series on the BBC. Another former editor, Steve Boulton, started an eponymous company, which made &quot;Young, Nazi &amp; Proud&quot;, a Bafta-winning profile of the young British National Party activist Mark Collett. Simon Albury went on to lead the Campaign for Quality Television and was a founder director of the ITV company Meridian Broadcasting.

One of the biggest British independent production companies is All 3 Media, which controls several other leading companies, including Lime Pictures, formerly Mersey Television, makers of &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;. It is run by Steve Morrison, a former &quot;WIA&quot; producer.

===Political connections===
Although in its early days, &quot;World in Action&quot; was reputed never to employ anyone who was on first-name terms with any politician, a number of subsequent British parliamentarians have &quot;World in Action&quot; on their &quot;curricula vitae&quot;. The most recent is the Conservative MP Adam Holloway, elected to the House of Commons in 2005. Former British cabinet minister Jack Straw worked on &quot;World in Action&quot; as a researcher, as did Margaret Beckett, who served as Tony Blair&#x27;s last Foreign Secretary. Chris Mullin, Labour MP for Sunderland South from 1987 to 2010, played a major role in the programme&#x27;s campaign on behalf of the Birmingham Six. Gus Macdonald, now Baron Macdonald of Tradeston, and from 1998 to 2003 a government minister, was formerly an executive on the programme. John Birt (by then ennobled as Baron Birt), was personal adviser to British Prime Minister Tony Blair between 2001 and 2005.

===Editors===
Editors of the programme (sometimes with the title of executive producer) were, successively, Tim Hewat, Derek Granger, Alex Valentine, David Plowright, Jeremy Wallington, Leslie Woodhead, John Birt, Gus Macdonald, David Boulton, Brian Lapping, Ray Fitzwalter, Allan Segal, David Cresswell, Stuart Prebble, Nick Hayes, Dianne Nelmes, Charles Tremayne, Steve Boulton, and Jeff Anderson. Anderson also became editor of &quot;World in Action&#x27;s&quot; replacement, &quot;Tonight&quot;, before becoming head of current affairs at ITV in 2006. Mike Lewis, a former &quot;WIA&quot; producer, was appointed editor of &quot;Tonight&quot; in October 2006.

===Academic connections===
Brian Winston, Pro-Vice Chancellor (External Relations) at the University of Lincoln, who has also held leading posts at the Universities of Westminster, Cardiff, Pennsylvania State and New York, was a researcher and producer in the early series of &quot;World in Action&quot;.

Ray Fitzwalter, &quot;WIA&#x27;s&quot; longest-serving editor and the man behind the ground-breaking Poulson investigations, became a visiting fellow at the University of Salford School of Media, Music, and Performance.

The late Gavin MacFadyen, who worked on early series of &quot;World in Action&quot; as a producer-director, best known for his undercover human-rights films, became a visiting professor at City University in 2005. He was also director of the Centre for Investigative Journalism.

David Leigh, who made &quot;Jonathan of Arabia&quot;, the film which provoked Jonathan Aitken&#x27;s self-destructive libel action, was made Britain&#x27;s first professor of reporting at City University, London, in September 2006.

===Camerawork===
Although a great many director/producers, journalists, and editors passed through the programme, one cameraman played an overwhelming role in shaping the appeal of the series. George Jesse Turner served on the programme from 1966 until its end. By his own count, he shot the principal footage for some 600 of its 1,400 editions, and filmed all of Michael Apted&#x27;s documentaries in the &quot;Seven Up!&quot; series. Turner was shot himself – in the backside – by an Israeli bullet while filming a clash between Fatah guerrillas and the Israeli Army in 1969. Shortly before he retired from Granada, Turner was honoured by BAFTA in 1999 for his work as a documentary cameraman.

Among the many cameramen who also contributed to &quot;WIA&quot; was Chris Menges, who went on to become a distinguished cinematographer – &quot;Kes&quot;, &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;, and &quot;The Mission&quot; are among his credits – and a film director for &quot;A World Apart&quot;.

==Title sequence==
Early series were introduced by composer Laurie Johnson&#x27;s track &quot;Private Eye&quot;, but the series is perhaps best remembered for the distinctive title sequence created by John Sheppard in the late 1960s, combining the image of da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; with a musical score of a modern classical music structure (inspired by Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugues), in a descending series of organ and acoustic guitar chords combined with a jazz rhythm. The score was given the working title of &quot;Jam for World in Action&quot;, and has been credited variously to Jonathon Weston or Shawn Phillips. English musician Mick Weaver also claims to have jointly authored the score with Phillips. The track was covered by Matt Berry in 2018 on his album &quot;Television Themes&quot;.

<text>Johann Ernst Elias Bessler (&quot;ca&quot;. 1680 – 30 November 1745), known as Orffyreus or Orffyré, was a German entrepreneur who claimed to have built several perpetual motion machines. Those claims generated considerable interest and controversy among some of the leading natural philosophers of the day, including Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Johann Bernoulli, John Theophilus Desaguliers, and Willem &#x27;s Gravesande. The modern scientific consensus is that Bessler perpetrated a deliberate fraud, although the details of this have not been satisfactorily explained.

==Life and career==
Bessler was born to a peasant family in Upper Lusatia, in the German Electorate of Saxony, &quot;circa&quot; 1680. He went to school in Zittau, where (according to his own account) he excelled in his studies and became a favorite of Christian Weise, the rector of the local &quot;Gymnasium&quot;. After he left school he began to travel widely, seeking his fortune. Having saved an alchemist from drowning in a well, he was rewarded with instruction on the fabrication of elixirs. After that Bessler earned his living as a healer and an unlicensed physician. He was also an apprentice watchmaker, until his fortunes improved when he married the wealthy daughter of the physician and mayor of Annaberg, Dr. Christian Schuhmann.

Bessler adopted the pseudonym &quot;Orffyreus&quot; by writing the letters of the alphabet in a circle and selecting the letters diametrically opposite to those of his surname (what would modernly be called a ROT13 cipher), thus obtaining &quot;Orffyre&quot;, which he then Latinized into &quot;Orffyreus&quot;. That was the name by which he was generally known thereafter.

===Orffyreus&#x27;s wheels===
In 1712, Bessler appeared in the town of Gera in the province of Reuss and exhibited a &quot;self-moving wheel,&quot; which was about in diameter and thick. Once in motion it was capable of lifting several kilograms (pounds). Bessler then moved to Draschwitz, a village near Leipzig, where in 1713 he constructed an even larger wheel, a little over in diameter and in width. That wheel could turn at fifty revolutions a minute and raise a weight of .

The eminent mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz visited Draschwitz in 1714 and witnessed a demonstration of Bessler&#x27;s wheel. In a letter to Robert Erskine, physician and advisor to Russian Tsar Peter the Great, Leibniz later wrote that Bessler was &quot;one of my friends&quot; and that he believed Bessler&#x27;s wheel to be a valuable invention. Bessler also received support from other members of Leibniz&#x27;s intellectual circle, including mathematician Johann Bernoulli, philosopher Christian Wolff, and architect Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach.


Bessler then constructed a still larger wheel in Merseburg, before moving to the independent state of Hesse-Kassel, where Prince Karl, the reigning Landgrave and an enthusiastic patron of mechanical inventors, appointed him as a commercial councillor (&quot;Kommerzialrat&quot;) for the town of Kassel and provided him with rooms in Weissenstein Castle. It was there that in 1717 he constructed his largest wheel so far, in diameter and thick.

The inventor demonstrated the operation of his wheel before various audiences, always taking care that the mechanism within the wheel should remain hidden from view, purportedly to prevent others from stealing his invention. The wheel was examined externally by several scientists, including Willem &#x27;s Gravesande, professor of mathematics and astronomy at Leiden University, who reported that he could not detect any fraud regarding its operation. On 12 November 1717 the wheel was locked in a room in the castle with the doors and windows sealed to prevent any interference. This was witnessed by the Landgrave and various officials. Two weeks later, the seals were broken and the room was opened, whereupon the wheel was found to be revolving. The door was resealed until 4 January 1718. The wheel was then found to be turning at twenty-six revolutions per minute.

Bessler demanded 100,000 Reichsthalers (equivalent to £20,000) in exchange for revealing the secret of his machines. Peter the Great was interested in purchasing the invention and sought advice on the matter from Gravesande and others. Gravesande examined the axle of the wheel, concluding that he could see no way in which power could be transmitted to it from the outside. Bessler, however, then smashed the wheel, accusing &#x27;s Gravesande of trying to discover the secret of the wheel without paying for it, and declaring that the curiosity of the professor had provoked him.

=== Later life ===
Bessler and his machine then vanished into obscurity. It is known that he was rebuilding his machine in 1727 and that &#x27;s Gravesande had agreed to examine it again, but it is not known whether it was ever tested. Bessler was apparently arrested in 1733, but by 1738 he was again free and living in an estate in Bad Karlshafen, near Kassel. Bessler died in 1745, aged sixty-five, when he fell to his death from a four-and-a-half-story windmill he was constructing in Fürstenburg.

==Mechanism of Orffyreus&#x27;s Wheel==
Bessler&#x27;s devices were all hollow wheels, with canvas covering the internal mechanism, that turned on a horizontal axis supported by vertical wooden beams on either side of the wheel. Christian Wolff, who viewed the wheel in 1715, wrote that Bessler freely revealed that the device utilized weights of about . Fischer von Erlach, who viewed the wheel in 1721, reported: &quot;At every turn of the wheel can be heard the sound of about eight weights, which fall gently on the side toward which the wheel turns.&quot; In a letter to Sir Isaac Newton, &#x27;s Gravesande reported that, when pushed, the wheel took two or three revolutions to reach a maximum speed of about 25 revolutions per minute. The wheels at Merseburg and Kassel were attached to three-bobbed pendula, one on either side, which presumably acted as regulators, limiting the maximum speed of revolution.

Bessler never revealed the mechanism that kept his wheel in motion and, according to surviving sources, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel was the only person whom he ever allowed to examine the inside of the wheel. In 1719 Bessler published a pamphlet in German and Latin, entitled &quot;The Triumphant Orffyrean Perpetual Motion&quot;, which gives a very vague account of his principles. He indicated that the wheel depended upon weights placed so that they can &quot;never attain equilibrium.&quot; This suggests that it was a kind of &quot;overbalanced wheel,&quot; a hypothetical gravity-powered device which is now recognized by physicists as impossible (see perpetual motion).

===Allegations of fraud===
Most of the people who met him, including supporters such as &#x27;s Gravesande, reported that Bessler was eccentric, ill-tempered, and perhaps even insane. From the beginning, Bessler&#x27;s work generated accusations of fraud from various people, including mining engineer Johann Gottfried Borlach, mathematician Christian Wagner, model-maker Andreas Gärtner, Kassel court tutor Jean-Pierre de Crousaz, and others. Gärtner went on to gain employ as model-master in the court of Augustus II the Strong in Dresden, and in that capacity he built several devices that reproduced some of the successes of Bessler&#x27;s public demonstrations, including the locked-room test, but which Gärtner acknowledged as mere trickery.

In November 1727, Bessler&#x27;s maid, Anne Rosine Mauersbergerin, ran away from Bessler&#x27;s household and testified under oath that she had turned the machines manually from an adjoining room, alternating in that job with Bessler&#x27;s wife, his brother Gottfried, and Bessler himself. &#x27;s Gravesande refused to accept the maid&#x27;s testimony, writing that he paid &quot;little attention to what a servant can say about machines&quot;. By then, &#x27;s Gravesande was embroiled in an academic dispute with members of Isaac Newton&#x27;s circle about the possibility of gravity-powered perpetual motion, which &#x27;s Gravesande persistently defended based partly on his belief that Bessler, though &quot;mad&quot;, was not a fraud.

The consensus view of modern scientists is that Bessler was perpetrating a deliberate fraud, though just how his wheel was powered is not entirely clear. According to the writers of &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot;, Orffyreus&#x27;s wheel, &quot;but for its strange effect on &#x27;s Gravesande, would have been forgotten long ago&quot;. If the maid&#x27;s confession were true, the testimonies by Prince Karl, &#x27;s Gravesande, and others about the conditions under which the wheel was tested and exhibited must be flawed.

<doc id="561535" wikidata="Q1867599" url="?curid=561535" title="Lockheed Martin X-35">
<text>The Lockheed Martin X-35 is a concept demonstrator aircraft (CDA) developed by Lockheed Martin for the Joint Strike Fighter program. The X-35 was declared the winner over the competing Boeing X-32 and a developed, armed version went on to enter production in the early 21st century as the F-35 Lightning II.

== Development ==

The Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) evolved out of several requirements for a common fighter to replace existing types, including the Common Affordable Lightweight Fighter (CALF) program, one of the JSF&#x27;s predecessors. The actual JSF development contract was signed on 16 November 1996. The JSF program was created to replace various aircraft while keeping development, production, and operating costs down. This was pursued by building three variants of one aircraft, with the initial goal of the variants sharing over 70% of their parts.

The first is the F-35A, a conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant. It is the smallest and lightest version, and is intended primarily to replace the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s aging F-16 Fighting Falcons and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs. This is the only version with an internal gun, the GAU-22. The F-35B is the short-takeoff and vertical-landing (STOVL) variant due to replace the U.S. Marine Corps AV-8 Harrier IIs and F/A-18 Hornets, and Royal Air Force/Royal Navy Harrier GR7/GR9s beginning in 2015.

The Royal Navy will use this to replace its Harrier GR7s and the RAF replace its Harrier GR9s. The U.S. Marine Corps will use the F-35B to replace both its AV-8B Harrier IIs and F/A-18 Hornets with a design similar in size to the Air Force F-35A, trading fuel volume for vertical flight systems. Like the Harrier, guns will be carried in a pod. Vertical flight is by far the riskiest, and in the end, a decisive factor in design. Lastly, the F-35C, a carrier-based (CV) variant, will replace the &quot;legacy&quot; F/A-18 Hornets and serve as a stealthy complement to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet.

It will have a larger, folding wing and larger control surfaces for improved low-speed control, and stronger landing gear for the stresses of carrier landings. The larger wing area provides increased range and payload, achieving much the same goal as the much heavier Super Hornet. The U.S. Navy initially planned to purchase 480 JSF; this number was eventually revised to 260 aircraft, with an additional 80 for the U.S. Marine Corps.

The primary customers and financial backers are the United States and the United Kingdom. Eight other nations are also funding the aircraft&#x27;s development. Total program development costs, less procurement, are estimated at over US$40 billion, of which the bulk has been underwritten by the United States. Production costs are estimated at US$102 million per unit for 2,400 units.

There are three levels of international participation. The United Kingdom is the sole &#x27;Level 1&#x27; partner, contributing slightly over US$2 billion, about 10% of the development costs. Level 2 partners are Italy, which is contributing US$1 billion, and the Netherlands, US$800 million. At Level 3 are Canada, US$440 million; Turkey, US$175 million; Australia, US$144 million; Norway, US$122 million; and Denmark, US$110 million. The levels generally reflect the financial stake in the program, the amount of technology transfer and subcontracts open for bid by national companies, and the priority order in which countries can obtain production aircraft. Israel and Singapore have also joined as Security Cooperative Participants. Due to delays in development and testing, the introduction date of the F-35 was gradually pushed from 2010 to 2015.

== Design ==
Elements of the X-35 design were pioneered by the F-22 Raptor, and portions of the VTOL exhaust duct design were previously used by the Convair Model 200, a 1972 supersonic VTOL fighter requirement for the Sea Control Ship; in particular, the three-bearing swivel nozzle used in the X-35B was pioneered by the Convair design.

Additionally, Lockheed purchased technical data from the canceled Yakovlev Yak-141 in 1991 for examination and analysis of its swivel nozzle. Although helmet-mounted display systems have already been integrated into some fourth-generation fighters such as the JAS 39 Gripen, the F-35 will be the first modern combat aircraft in which helmet-mounted displays will replace a head-up display altogether.

During concept definition, two demonstrator airframes for each contractor team would be flight-tested. Lockheed Martin&#x27;s demonstrator aircraft consisted of the X-35A (which was later converted into the X-35B), and the larger-winged X-35C. Both the X-32 and X-35 power plants were derived from Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s F119, with the STOVL variant of the latter incorporating a Rolls-Royce Lift Fan module. Because these were proof of concept demonstrators for STOVL risk reduction, the demonstrator aircraft did not need to have the internal structure or most subsystems of the final aircraft as a weapon system.

===Shaft-driven lift fan===
Instead of lift engines or using a direct lift engine like the Rolls-Royce Pegasus in the Harrier jump jets, the X-35B was powered by the F119-PW-611 which used the new shaft-driven lift fan system, patented by Lockheed Martin engineer Paul Bevilaqua, and developed by Rolls-Royce. In normal wing-borne flight, the F119-PW-611 was configured as a normal medium-bypass reheated turbofan. The turbofan acted somewhat like a turboshaft engine embedded into the fuselage (but with a much smaller percentage of total heat energy being extracted by the turbine stage).

A portion of engine power was extracted via a turbine, and used to drive a shaft running forward via a clutch-and-bevel gearbox to a vertically mounted, contra-rotating lift fan. This was located forward of the main engine in the center of the aircraft (this can also be viewed the same as a high-bypass turbofan but with the low-pressure fan stages mounted remotely from the engine core on an extended, clutched shaft, and creating thrust downwards rather than back around the engine core as in a conventional turbofan).

Bypass air from the cruise engine medium-bypass turbofan compressor stages exhausted through a pair of roll-post nozzles in the wings on either side of the fuselage, while the thrust from the lift fan balanced the thrust of the hot core stream exhausting through vectored cruise nozzle at the tail. The X-35B powerplant effectively acted as a flow multiplier, much as a turbofan achieves efficiencies by moving unburned air at a lower velocity, and getting the same effect as the Harrier&#x27;s huge, but supersonically impractical main fan.

Like lift engines, this added machinery was dead weight during flight, but the increased lift thrust enhanced take-off payload by even more. The cool fan also reduced the harmful effects of hot, high-velocity air which could harm runway pavement or an aircraft carrier deck. Though risky and complicated, it was made to work to the satisfaction of DoD officials, and flight testing of the X-35 demonstrators reduced risk to Technology Readiness Level 6.

== Operational history ==

===Flight test evaluation===
The X-35A first flew on 24 October 2000 and tested air vehicle performance and handling characteristics. After 28 test flights, the aircraft was converted to the X-35B, which added the shaft-drive lift fan, aft swivel nozzle, and roll posts. On 20 July 2001, to demonstrate the X-35&#x27;s STOVL capability, the X-35B took off in less than , went supersonic, and landed vertically. The X-35C first flew on 16 December 2000 and tested simulated carrier recovery and power approach.

In the fly-off between the X-32 and the X-35, the latter was judged to be the winner. As a result, a contract for System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of the F-35 was awarded on 26 October 2001 to Lockheed Martin.

===F-35 production===

There are a number of differences between the X-35 and F-35, which was designed to be an operational weapon system. The forward fuselage was lengthened by to make room for mission avionics, while the horizontal stabilizers were correspondingly moved aft to retain balance and control. The diverterless supersonic inlet cowl shape changed from a four-sided to a three-sided shape and was moved aft. To accommodate weapons bays, the fuselage section was fuller with the top surface raised by along the centerline. Following the designation of the X-35 prototypes, the three variants were designated F-35A (CTOL), F-35B (STOVL), and F-35C (CV).

==Aircraft on display==

The X-35A was converted into the X-35B for the STOVL part of the competition. It now resides at the National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, near Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia.

Following the end of the competition, the X-35C was transferred to the Patuxent River Naval Air Museum in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland.

<doc id="561550" wikidata="Q3273234" url="?curid=561550" title="Pilobolus">
<text>Pilobolus is a genus of fungi that commonly grows on herbivore dung.

==Life cycle==
The life cycle of &quot;Pilobolus&quot; begins with a black sporangium that has been discharged onto a plant substrate such as grass. A herbivorous animal such as a horse then eats the substrate, unknowingly consuming the sporangium as well. The &quot;Pilobolus&quot; sporangium survives the passage through the gastrointestinal tract without germinating, and emerges with the excrement. Once outside its host, spores within the sporangium germinate and grow as a mycelium within the excrement, where it is a primary colonizer. Later, the fungus fruits to produce more spores.
The asexual fruiting structure (the sporangiophore) of &quot;Pilobolus&quot; species is unique. It consists of a transparent stalk which rises above the excrement to end in a balloon-like subsporangial vesicle. On top of this, a single, black sporangium develops. The sporangiophore has the remarkable ability of orienting itself to point directly towards a light source. The shape and transparency of the subsporangial vesicle allow it to act as a lens, focusing light into carotenoid pigments deposited near the base of the vesicle, which absorb the photons and allow cells to detect the light level in the direction of the lens. The developing sporangiophore grows such that the maturing sporangium is aimed directly at the light.
When turgor pressure within the subsporangial vesicle builds to a sufficient level (often 7 ATM or greater), the sporangium is launched, and can travel anywhere from a couple of centimeters to a distance of 3 meters (10ft). For a sporangiophore less than 1cm tall, this involves acceleration from 0 to 20 km/h in only 2 μs, subjecting it to over 20,000 G, equivalent to a human being launched at 100 times the speed of sound. The orientation of the stalk towards the early morning sun apparently guarantees that the sporangium is shot some distance from the excrement, enhancing the chances that it will attach to vegetation and be eaten by a new host.

Another adaptation of &quot;Pilobolus&quot; is that the sporangium is covered in calcium oxalate crystals. Besides serving as a protective mechanism, their hydrophobic nature also leads the sporangium to flip over onto its sticky bottom after landing in a drop of dew, thus allowing it to cling to a plant substrate. &quot;Pilobolus&quot; species can be grown in artificial culture, but only when the growth medium is supplemented with some form of chelated iron, or with sterilized herbivore dung.

The forcible discharge mechanism of &quot;Pilobolus&quot; is exploited by parasitic nematodes including lungworms in the genus &quot;Dictyocaulus&quot;. Larval lungworm nematodes excreted by infected deer, elk, cattle, horses, and other hosts climb up &quot;Pilobolus&quot; sporangiophores and are discharged with the sporangium. They complete their life cycle when they and their &quot;Pilobolus&quot; vector are eaten by a new host.

<text>The Auditorium Building in Chicago is one of the best-known designs of Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler. Completed in 1889, the building is located at the northwest corner of South Michigan Avenue and Ida B. Wells Drive. The building was designed to be a multi-use complex, including offices, a theater, and a hotel. As a young apprentice, Frank Lloyd Wright worked on some of the interior design.

The Auditorium Theatre is part of the Auditorium Building and is located at 50 East Ida B. Wells Drive. The theater was the first home of the Chicago Civic Opera and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 17, 1970. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1975, and was designated a Chicago Landmark on September 15, 1976. In addition, it is a historic district contributing property for the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District. Since 1947, the Auditorium Building has been part of Roosevelt University.

==Origin and purpose==
Ferdinand Peck, a Chicago businessman, incorporated the Chicago Auditorium Association in December 1886 to develop what he wanted to be the world&#x27;s largest, grandest, most expensive theater that would rival such institutions as the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. He was said to have wanted to make high culture accessible to the working classes of Chicago.

The building was to include an office block and a first class hotel. Peck persuaded many Chicago business tycoons to go on board with him, including Marshall Field, Edson Keith, Martin A. Ryerson, Charles L. Hutchinson and George Pullman. The association hired the renowned architectural firm of Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan to design the building. At the time, a young Frank Lloyd Wright was employed at the firm as draftsman, and he may have contributed to the design.

The Auditorium was built for a syndicate of businessmen to house a large civic opera house; to provide an economic base it was decided to wrap the auditorium with a hotel and office block. Hence Adler &amp; Sullivan had to plan a complex multiple-use building. Fronting on Michigan Avenue, overlooking the lake, was the hotel (now Roosevelt University) while the offices were placed to the west on Wabash Avenue. The entrance to the auditorium is on the south side beneath the tall blocky eighteen-story tower. The rest of the building is a uniform ten stories, organized in the same way as Richardson&#x27;s Marshall Field Wholesale Store. The interior embellishment, however, is wholly Sullivan&#x27;s, and some of the details, because of their continuous curvilinear foliate motifs, are among the nearest equivalents to European Art Nouveau architecture.

==Design==
Sullivan and Adler designed a tall structure with load-bearing outer walls, and based the exterior appearance partly on the design of H.H. Richardson&#x27;s Marshall Field Warehouse, another Chicago landmark. The Auditorium is a heavy, impressive structure externally, and was more striking in its day when buildings of its scale were less common. When completed, it was the tallest building in the city and largest building in the United States.

One of the most innovative features of the building was its massive raft foundation, designed by Adler in conjunction with engineer Paul Mueller. The soil beneath the Auditorium consists of soft blue clay to a depth of over 100 feet, which made conventional foundations impossible. Adler and Mueller designed a floating mat of crisscrossed railroad ties, topped with a double layer of steel rails embedded in concrete, the whole assemblage coated with pitch.

The resulting raft distributed the weight of the massive outer walls over a large area. However, the weight of the masonry outer walls in relation to the relatively lightweight interior deformed the raft during the course of a century, and today portions of the building have settled as much as 29 inches. This deflection is clearly visible in the theater lobby, where the mosaic floor takes on a distinct slope as it nears the outer walls. This settlement is not because of poor engineering but the fact the design was changed during construction. The original plan had the exterior covered in lightweight terra-cotta, but this was changed to stone after the foundations were under construction. Most of the settlement occurred within a decade after construction, and at one time a plan existed to shorten the interior supports to level the floors but this was never carried out.

In the center of the building was a 4,300 seat auditorium, originally intended primarily for production of Grand Opera. In keeping with Peck&#x27;s democratic ideals, the auditorium was designed so that all seats would have good views and acoustics. The original plans had no box seats and when these were added to the plans they did not receive prime locations.

Housed in the building around the central space were an 1890 addition of 136 offices and a 400-room hotel, whose purpose was to generate much of the revenue to support the opera. While the Auditorium Building was not intended as a commercial building, Peck wanted it to be self-sufficient. Revenue from the offices and hotel was meant to allow ticket prices to remain reasonable. In reality, both the hotel and office block became unprofitable within a few years.

==Later uses==
On October 5, 1887, President Grover Cleveland laid the cornerstone for the Auditorium Building. The 1888 Republican National Convention was held in a partially finished building where Benjamin Harrison was nominated as a presidential candidate. On December 9, 1889, President Benjamin Harrison dedicated the building and opera star Adelina Patti sang &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; to thunderous applause. Adler &amp; Sullivan had also opened their offices on the 16th and 17th floors of the Auditorium tower.
The Chicago Symphony Orchestra debuted on October 16, 1891, and made its home in the Auditorium Theatre until moving to Orchestra Hall in 1904.

The opera company renting the accommodation moved to the Civic Opera House in 1929, and the Auditorium Theatre closed during the Great Depression. In 1941, it was taken over by the city of Chicago to be used as a World War II servicemen&#x27;s center. By 1946, Roosevelt University moved into the Auditorium Building, but the theater was not restored to its former splendor.

In 1952, Congress Parkway was widened, bringing the curb to the southern edge of the building. To make room for a sidewalk, some ground-floor rooms and part of the theater lobby were removed and a sidewalk arcade created.
On October 31, 1967, the Auditorium Theatre reopened and through 1975, the Auditorium served as a rock venue. Among other notable acts, the Grateful Dead played there ten times from 1971 through 1977.

The Doors also played their first concert at the Auditorium Building after their arrest of singer Jim Morrison on June 14, 1969.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1975.

The building was equipped with the first central air conditioning system and the theater was the first to be entirely lit by incandescent light bulbs. In 2001, a major restoration of the Auditorium Theatre was begun by Daniel P. Coffey and Associates in conjunction with EverGreene Architectural Arts to return the theater to its original colors and finishes.

On April 30, 2015, the National Football League held its 2015 NFL draft in the Auditorium Theatre, the first time the league had held its annual draft in Chicago in more than 50 years.

<doc id="561564" wikidata="Q2630552" url="?curid=561564" title="Joss paper">
<text>Joss paper, also known as incense papers, are papercrafts or sheets of paper made into burnt offerings common in Chinese ancestral worship (such as the veneration of the deceased family members and relatives on holidays and special occasions). Worship of deities in Chinese folk religion also uses a similar type of joss paper. Joss paper, as well as other papier-mâché items, are also burned or buried in various Asian funerals, &quot;to ensure that the spirit of the deceased has sufficient means in the afterlife&quot;. In Taiwan alone, the annual revenue that temples received from burning joss paper was US$400 million (NT$13 billion) as of 2014.

==Use==
Spirit money is most often used for venerating those departed but has also been known to be used for other purposes such as a gift from a groom&#x27;s family to the bride&#x27;s ancestors. Spirit money has been said to have been given for the purpose of enabling their deceased family members to have all they will need or want in the afterlife. It has also been noted that these offerings have been given as a bribe to Yanluo Wang to hold their ancestors for a shorter period of time.

Venerating the ancestors is based on the belief that the spirits of the dead continue to dwell in the natural world and have the power to influence the fortune and fate of the living. The goal of ancestor worship is to ensure the ancestor&#x27;s continued well-being and positive disposition towards the living and sometimes to ask for special favours or assistance. Rituals of ancestor worship most commonly consist of offerings to the deceased to provide for their welfare in the afterlife which is envisioned to be similar to the earthly life. The burning of spirit money enables the ancestor to purchase luxuries and necessities needed for a comfortable afterlife.
Many temples have large furnaces outside the main gate to burn joss paper. Folding the paper is an essential part of the burning ceremony as it distinguishes joss paper from actual money; and, it provides good luck for those who fold it. Burning actual money would be untenable for most people, and is also considered unlucky in Asian cultures. The Joss paper may be folded into specific shapes which are meant to bring on good luck and people tend to burn lavish amounts to ensure that the offering is well received.

People burn joss paper during many occasions, e.g., Lunar New Year, Ghost Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, Dongzhi (Winter solstice), Qingming Festival, Chongyang Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, etc.

Every fifteen days business owners in Taiwan burn spirit money in red braziers and set out offering tables on the sidewalk for both gods and ghosts. This coincides with an ancient calendar system divided into twenty-four fifteen-day periods.

A simplified modern Chinese offering is made by drawing a circle with chalk on the sidewalk or the pavement between residential buildings and burning the paper offering within the circle. This is quite common in all Chinese cities and villages today.

Due to environmental concerns, some contemporary Joss paper burners are now fitted with a special cover which eliminates the spread of burning ashes. The cover allows enough oxygen in to ensure that 

Spirit money is most commonly burned, but may also be offered by being held into the wind or placed into the deceased&#x27;s coffin at funeral ceremonies.

Depending on the type and status of the deity being worshiped, paper with metal foil or with ink seals of various sizes may be burned. Different regions of the world have different preferences for the type of Joss paper that is used. For instance, Hell Bank Notes are commonly found in regions where Cantonese populations dominate but are rarely seen or used in places such as Taiwan or Macau, which use &quot;gold paper&quot;. The Joss paper is folded in half, or bought pre-folded into the shape of gold ingots before being burned in an earthenware pot or a specially built chimney. Joss paper burning is usually the last performed act in Chinese deity or ancestor worship ceremonies. The papers may also be folded and stacked into elaborate pagodas or lotuses.

In Taoist rituals, the practice of offering joss paper to deities or ancestors is an essential part of the worship. Some Chinese Buddhist temples, such as Singapore Buddhist Lodge in Singapore and all Fo Guang Shan affiliated temples in Taiwan have discouraged offering of joss papers during ancestral worship in their ancestral tablet hall out of concern for the environmental pollution.

===Western countries===
Shops selling joss paper goods have been established in Western countries – such as the USA or the United Kingdom – by Chinese immigrants. For example, Mulberry Street in New York, also known as Chinatown, has papier-mâché retailers which are similar to those in Hong Kong. They serve the Chinese who are living there, in order to celebrate Chinese festivals.

==Health impact==
Metal contents analysis of ash samples shows that joss paper burning emits a lot of toxic components causing health risks. There is a significant amount of heavy metals in the dust fume and bottom ash, e.g., aluminium, iron, manganese, copper, lead, zinc and cadmium. Another study found that burning gold and silver joss papers during festivals may contribute to Parkinson&#x27;s disease among the elderly and slow child development.

==Types==

===Traditional===
Joss paper is traditionally made from coarse bamboo paper, which feels handmade with many variances and imperfections, although rice paper is also commonly used. Traditional joss is cut into individual squares or rectangles. Depending on the region, Joss paper may be decorated with seals, stamps, pieces of contrasting paper, engraved designs or other motifs.

Different types of spirit money are given to distinct categories of spirits. The three main types of spirit money are cash (also known as copper), silver and gold. Cash monies are given to newly deceased spirits and spirits of the unknown. Golden Joss papers (jin) are mostly offered to the Deities such as the Jade Emperor. Silver Joss paper (yin) is given to ancestral spirits as well as other spirits. These distinctions between the three categories of spirit money must be followed precisely to avoid confusing or insulting the spirits.
===Contemporary===

More contemporary or westernized varieties of Joss paper include paper currency, credit cards, cheques, as well as papier-mâché clothes, houses, cars, toiletries, electronics and servants (together known as Zhizha in Mandarin &quot;zhǐzhā&quot; :zh:紙紮). The designs on paper items vary from the very simple to very elaborate (with custom artwork and names).

In 2006, in response to the burning of &quot;messy sacrificial items&quot;, such as paper cars, houses, and pills, Dou Yupei, the PRC deputy minister for civil affairs, announced that the ministry intended to ban at least the more extreme forms of joss paper.

====&quot;Hell Bank Notes&quot;====
Much like the traditional gold and silver paper, Hell Bank Notes are a modernized version of joss paper and serve as the official currency for the afterlife. Living relatives offer them to dead ancestors by burning (or placing them in coffins in the case of funerals) the bank notes as a bribe to Yanluo for a shorter stay or to escape punishment, or for the ancestors themselves to use in spending on lavish items in the afterlife.

The word &quot;hell&quot; may have been derived from:
#The preaching of Christian missionaries, who told the Chinese that non-Christians and their ancestors would go to hell when they died as non-believers. Purgatory as taught by certain Christian denomininations is a parallel. 
#A translation of the word &quot;hell&quot; that matches the pre-existing Chinese concept of &quot;underworld realm&quot;, which in Taoist cosmology had been considered one of the destinations on the journey of rebirth of every soul of the dead regardless of his or her virtue during life.

Hell Bank Notes are also known for their enormous denominations ranging from ten thousand to five million. The bills almost always are in the form of dollars or yuan, and usually feature an image of either the Jade Emperor or Yanluo Wang on the front and the &quot;headquarters&quot; of the Hell Bank on the back. Another common feature is the signatures of both the Yanluo Wang and the Judges of Underworld, both of whom apparently also serve as the Hell bank&#x27;s governor and deputy governor (as featured on the back). Yet another feature is a Hell Bank Note being a replica of a United States one-hundred-dollar bill, with a disclaimer noting the bill is counterfeit.

<doc id="561578" wikidata="Q465774" url="?curid=561578" title="Order of the Golden Fleece">
<text>The Distinguished Order of the Golden Fleece (, ) is a Catholic order of chivalry founded in 1430 in Bruges by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, to celebrate his marriage to Isabella of Portugal. Today, two branches of the order exist, namely the Spanish Fleece and the Austrian Fleece; the current grand masters are King Felipe VI of Spain and Karl von Habsburg, head of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, respectively. The Grand Chaplain of the Austrian branch is Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, Archbishop of Vienna.

The separation of the two existing branches took place as a result of the War of the Spanish Succession of 1701–1714. The grand master of the order, Charles II of Spain (a Habsburg), had died childless in 1700, and so the right to succeed to the throne of Spain (and thus to become the Sovereign of the Order of the Golden Fleece) initiated a global conflict. On one hand, Charles, brother of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I, claimed the Spanish crown as an agnatic member of the House of Habsburg, which had inherited the Burgundian titles and had held the Spanish throne for almost two centuries. However, the late king of Spain had named Philip of Bourbon, his sister&#x27;s grandchild, as his successor in his will. After the conclusion of the war in 1714, the European powers recognized Philip of Bourbon as King of Spain, and the old Burgundian Habsburg territories became part of the Austrian Netherlands (1714–1797), together with the Treasure of the Order and its archive. Thus the two dynasties, namely the Bourbons of Spain and the Habsburgs of Austria, have ever since continued heading the separate orders of the Golden Fleece.

The Golden Fleece became one of the most prestigious and historic orders of chivalry in the world. De Bourgoing wrote in 1789 that &quot;the number of knights of the Golden Fleece is very limited in Spain, and this is the order, which of all those in Europe, has best preserved its ancient splendour&quot;. This conclusion can be made reciprocally for both branches, as both adhere to the limitation set in the 17th century by the Order‘s sovereign. Each collar is solid gold and is estimated to be worth around €50,000 as of 2018, making it the most expensive chivalrous order. Current knights of the Spanish order include Emperor Akihito of Japan, former Tsar Simeon of Bulgaria, and Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, amongst 13 others. Knights of the Austrian branch include King Philippe of Belgium, his father King Albert II, Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, The Prince and Grandmaster of the Order of Malta John Dunlap in addition to several Archdukes, Princes of the Holy Roman Empire and few noblemen.

The Spanish order has become an order of merit of the state, while the Austrian order has remained a catholic chivalric order and is recognised even by the Republic of Austria as an international legal entity.

==Origin==

The Order of the Golden Fleece was established on 10 January 1430, by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy (on the occasion of his wedding to Isabella of Portugal), in celebration of the prosperous and wealthy domains united in his person that ran from Flanders to Switzerland. The jester and dwarf Madame d&#x27;Or performed at the creation of the order of the Golden Fleece in Bruges. It is restricted to a limited number of knights, initially 24 but increased to 30 in 1433, and 50 in 1516, plus the sovereign. The order&#x27;s first king of arms was Jean Le Fèvre de Saint-Remy. It received further privileges unusual to any order of knighthood: the sovereign undertook to consult the order before going to war; all disputes between the knights were to be settled by the order; at each chapter the deeds of each knight were held in review, and punishments and admonitions were dealt out to offenders, and to this the sovereign was expressly subject; the knights could claim as of right to be tried by their fellows on charges of rebellion, heresy and treason, and Charles V conferred on the order exclusive jurisdiction over all crimes committed by the knights; the arrest of the offender had to be by warrant signed by at least six knights, and during the process of charge and trial he remained not in prison but in the gentle custody of his fellow knights. The order, conceived in an ecclesiastical spirit in which mass and obsequies were prominent and the knights were seated in choirstalls like canons, was explicitly denied to heretics, and so became an exclusively Catholic honour during the Reformation. The officers of the order were the chancellor, the treasurer, the registrar, and the king of arms (herald, ).

The Duke&#x27;s stated reason for founding this institution had been given in a proclamation issued following his marriage, in which he wrote that he had done so &quot;for the reverence of God and the maintenance of our Christian Faith, and to honor and exalt the noble order of knighthood, and also ... to do honor to old knights; ... so that those who are at present still capable and strong of body and do each day the deeds pertaining to chivalry shall have cause to continue from good to better; and ... so that those knights and gentlemen who shall see worn the order ... should honor those who wear it, and be encouraged to employ themselves in noble deeds ...&quot;.

The Order of the Golden Fleece was defended from possible accusations of prideful pomp by the Burgundian court poet Michault Taillevent, who asserted that it was instituted:

Translated into English:

The choice of the Golden Fleece of Colchis as the symbol of a Christian order caused some controversy, not so much because of its pagan context, which could be incorporated in chivalric ideals, as in the Nine Worthies, but because the feats of Jason, familiar to all, were not without causes of reproach, expressed in anti-Burgundian terms by Alain Chartier in his &quot;Ballade de Fougères&quot; referring to Jason as &quot;Who, to carry off the fleece of Colchis, was willing to commit perjury.&quot; The bishop of Châlons, chancellor of the order, identified it instead with the fleece of Gideon that received the dew of Heaven ().

The badge of the order, in the form of a sheepskin, was suspended from a jewelled collar of firesteels in the shape of the letter B, for Burgundy, linked by flints; with the motto (&#x27;No Mean Reward for Labours&#x27;) engraved on the front of the central link, and Philip&#x27;s motto (&#x27;I will have no other&#x27;) on the back (non-royal knights of the Golden Fleece were forbidden to belong to any other order of knighthood).

During this time, the Burgundian court was culturally leading in Europe and so the new order, with its festivals, ceremonies, rituals and constitution, was seen by many as a role model in the sense of a princely order based on the ideals of Christian chivalry. Aid to the Byzantine Empire or the pushing back of the Ottomans was repeatedly promoted by the Burgundian dukes in connection with their order. The Burgundian fleet actually crossed Rhodes and the Black Sea, but all of the ideas came from an extended planning phase that was not yet complete.
After the death of Charles the Bold in an attempt to conquer the Duchy of Lorraine caused the extinction of the House of Burgundy in 1477, the order passed to the House of Habsburg. A few months after his marriage to the heiress Mary of Burgundy, Emperor Maximilian of Habsburg was knighted in Bruges on April 30, 1478, and then appointed sovereign (grand master) of the order. All renegade or disloyal knights of the order in the course of the subsequent War of the Burgundian Succession were expelled from the order by Maximilian. The memory of the dead was erased and their coats of arms were broken.
From Emperor Charles V or King Philip II of Spain, the sovereign was on the one hand the head of the Spanish line of the Habsburgs and on the other hand also king of Spain. Charles V was appointed head of the order at the age of 9 and identified himself strongly with this community throughout his life. The ideal of chivalrous and brave living was brought to him by William de Croÿ. When in 1700 Charles II of Spain died childless, both the Habsburgs from the Habsburg lands and the Bourbons, as the new kings of Spain, claimed sovereignty of the order. Both noble houses basically invoked their claims regarding the Spanish crown. The House of Habsburg&#x27;s claim relied on Article 65 of the Statutes. Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI was able to claim sovereignty of the Netherlands, the Burgundian heartland, during the War of the Spanish Succession and thus he could celebrate the order&#x27;s festival in Vienna in 1713. As with Maximilian I or Charles V, the order was again closely associated with the Holy Roman Empire.
Regardless of this, the order was divided into two lines. The Habsburg order owns the archive and the old insignia and adheres more to the original statutes.

==Spanish order==

With the absorption of the Burgundian lands into the Spanish Habsburg empire, the sovereignty of the order passed to the Habsburg kings of Spain, where it remained until the death of the last of the Spanish Habsburgs, Charles II, in 1700. He was succeeded as king by Philip V, a Bourbon. The dispute between Philip and the Habsburg pretender to the Spanish throne, the Archduke Charles, led to the War of the Spanish Succession, and also resulted in the division of the order into Spanish and Austrian branches. In either case the sovereign, as Duke of Burgundy, writes the letter of appointment in French.

The controversial conferral of the Fleece on Napoleon and his brother Joseph, while Spain was occupied by French troops, angered the exiled king of France, Louis XVIII, and caused him to return his collar in protest. These, and other awards by Joseph, were revoked by King Ferdinand on the restoration of Bourbon rule in 1813. Napoleon created by Order of 15 August 1809 the Order of the Three Golden Fleeces, in view of his sovereignty over Austria, Spain and Burgundy. This was opposed by Joseph I of Spain and appointments to the new order were never made.

In 1812, the acting government of Spain conferred the Fleece upon the Duke of Wellington, an act confirmed by Ferdinand on his resumption of power, with the approval of Pope Pius VII. Wellington therefore became the first Protestant to be honoured with the Golden Fleece. It has subsequently also been conferred upon non-Christians, such as Bhumibol Adulyadej, King of Thailand.

There was another crisis in 1833 when Isabella II became Queen of Spain in defiance of Salic Law that did not allow women to become heads of state. Her right to confer the Fleece was challenged by Spanish Carlists.

Sovereignty remained with the head of the Spanish House of Bourbon during the republican (1931–1939) and Francoist (1939–1975) periods, and is held today by the present king of Spain, Felipe VI. There is confusion towards the conferral of the Fleece on Francisco Franco in 1972. The order was illegally offered by Infante Jaime to him on the occasion of his son&#x27;s wedding to the dictator&#x27;s granddaughter, Carmen. Franco kindly refused the order on the basis of legitimacy and primogeniture, stating that the Golden Fleece could only be granted by the reigning king of Spain. Moreover, the right of conferral was in any case a prerogative of Jaime&#x27;s younger brother, Infante Juan, as designated heir to the throne of Spain by his father Alfonso XIII.

Knights of the order are entitled to be addressed with the style &quot;His/Her Excellency&quot; in front of their name.

===Armorial of the Spanish Golden Fleece===
==Austrian (Habsburg) order==



The Austrian order did not suffer from the political difficulties of the Spanish, remaining (with the exception of the British prince regent, later George IV) an honour solely for Catholic royalty and nobility. The problem of female inheritance was avoided on the accession of Maria Theresa in 1740, as sovereignty of the order passed not to herself but to her husband, Francis.

The entire treasure of the order, which also includes the &quot;Ainkhürn sword&quot; of the last duke of Burgundy and the centuries-old oath cross, which contains a cross splinter of the True Cross, is located in the Vienna Treasury and, like the archive and the old insignia, is the property of the Habsburg branch.

Upon the collapse of the Austrian monarchy after the First World War, King Albert I of Belgium requested that the sovereignty and treasure of the order be transferred to him as the ruler of the former Habsburg lands of Burgundy. This claim was seriously considered by the victorious Allies at Versailles but was eventually rejected due to the intervention of King Alfonso XIII of Spain, who took possession of the property of the order on behalf of the dethroned emperor, Charles I of Austria.

Nazi Germany classified the order as hostile to the state and tried to confiscate the entire treasure of the order including the archive. Hitler categorically rejected the centuries-old Habsburg principles of &quot;live and let live&quot; in relation to ethnic groups, peoples, minorities, religions, cultures and languages, and also wanted to seize significant works of art that are unique worldwide. Hitler intended to decide on the use of the assets after they had been confiscated. After the annexation of Austria in 1938, Max von Hohenberg, Habsburg representative in the affairs of the order, was immediately sent to a concentration camp.

After the Second World War in 1953, the Republic of Austria continued to confirm to the House of Habsburg the right to the Order on its territory, in particular that the Order has its own legal personality. As a result, the order itself remains the owner of the treasure and the archive. The historically and artistically extremely valuable treasure from the early days of the order includes the oath cross from 1401/02, the golden collar of office for the herald (1517), collars of the order (approx. 1560), vestments and historical relics.

Sovereignty of the Austrian branch remains with the head of the House of Habsburg, which was handed over on 20 November 2000 by Otto von Habsburg to his elder son, Karl von Habsburg.

November 30 (feast day of St. Andrew the Apostle, patron saint of Burgundy) is the day of the order, when new members are accepted into the order. The extremely valuable treasures are in the Vienna Treasury and in the Austrian State Archives. To date, the new knights and officers take the oath in front of the so-called &quot;oath cross&quot;, which is kept in the treasury in Vienna. It is a simply designed golden cross set with precious stones (sapphires, rubies and pearls). In the central part of the cross there is a splinter of the Holy Cross, which makes it a relic cross.

==Chapters of the order==

==Insignia==



==Privileges==
Knights of the order enjoy a variety of privileges. Some privileges are shared, while others differ due to split of the order in 1700 and they henceforth developed their own characteristics. The Spanish order has developed into a state order of merit, while the Austrian order has remained a Catholic order of knighthood with a strong bond of brotherhood.

===Heraldry=== 
Jean-Baptiste Christyn (1630–1690) records and codifies the heraldic privilege of golden helmets during his time as Chancellor of Brabant (1687–1690). He was considered a leading authority on heraldic law in the Habsburg Netherlands by contemporaries. In his work Jurisprudentia heroica (part 2, page 19) he remarks:

The privilege of the golden helmets was based on the practices observed at the chapters of the order.

===Form of Address===
The bond of knights within the brotherhood was enforced with the privilege to address each other in writing and when greeting one and another in person with “Mon Cousin”.

===Holy Mass and Altar===
Pope Pius X reestablished in 1913 the privilege that Knights of the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece have the right to deem a location as worthy for holding a Holy Mass. The celebration of a Holy Mass on non-sacred ground, e.g. at home, is usually only possible with the permission of the local bishop. Knights may do so without asking for permission.

A derivative privilege from the above mentioned right is the possibility to possess and use a personal, portable altar. This enables a knight to raise an altar wherever he deems it suitable in order to hold a Holy Mass. This privilege stems from the medieval and annulled right to hold the Holy Mass at the sick-bed of a knight.

<doc id="561579" wikidata="Q6501676" url="?curid=561579" title="Laurie Mylroie">
<text>Laurie Mylroie (born July 22, 1953) is an American author and analyst who has written extensively on Iraq and the War on Terror. &quot;The National Interest&quot; first published this work in an article entitled, &quot;The World Trade Center Bombing: Who is Ramzi Yousef? And Why it Matters.&quot; In her book &quot;Study of Revenge&quot; (2000), Mylroie laid out her argument that the Iraqi regime under Saddam Hussein had sponsored the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and subsequent terrorist attacks. She claimed those attacks were part of an ongoing war that Saddam waged against America following the cease-fire to the 1991 Gulf War. Less than a year after her book was published, the September 11 attacks occurred. Mylroie subsequently adopted the view that Saddam had been responsible for the attacks, defending it on many occasions, including before the 9/11 Commission.

Mylroie&#x27;s writings are considered to have been influential among neoconservatives during the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Several of them praised &quot;Study of Revenge&quot;, including ex-CIA Director James Woolsey, who called it &quot;brilliant and brave&quot; in his blurb for the dust jacket of the book.

Mylroie has been criticized by numerous terrorism experts, including Peter Bergen, Daniel Benjamin, and Dr. Robert S. Leiken, all of whom point out that Mylroie&#x27;s theories rely on dubious assumptions and were thoroughly refuted by analysts and investigators at the CIA, the FBI, the NTSB, and other investigatory bodies.

==Career==
Mylroie earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Cornell University and a doctorate in political science from Harvard University. She also studied Arabic at the American University of Cairo. Subsequently, she taught as an assistant professor at Harvard University in the Department of Government (Political Science), Faculty of Arts and Science, and then as an associate professor in the Strategy and Policy Department of the U.S. Naval War College.

She met with Bill Clinton on Iraq during Clinton&#x27;s 1992 presidential campaign, but she became a strong critic of Clinton for what she came to charge was his mishandling of the terrorism that began on his watch, starting with the February 26, 1993, bombing of New York&#x27;s World Trade Center.

Mylroie was a research fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy and then with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, as well as an adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Following the 9/11 attacks, she served on DARPA&#x27;s Special Task Force on Terrorism and Deterrence and a DTRA panel on counter-terrorism. She deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, where she served as a cultural adviser to the U.S. military. She has written three books and numerous articles, which have appeared in &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;The National Interest&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;Washington Times&quot;, among others.

==Iraq connection claims==
Mylroie&#x27;s suspicions that Iraq was behind the World Trade Center bombing first appeared at length in an article in &quot;The National Interest&quot;, &quot;The World Trade Center Bomb: Who is Ramzi Yousef? And Why it Matters.&quot;

Her &quot;National Interest&quot; article appeared in expanded form in &quot;Study of Revenge: Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Unfinished War Against America&quot; (2000). Mylroie later claimed that &quot;the Clinton White House did not want to hear that Iraq was behind the bombing.&quot; Mylroie also argued that Iraq was linked to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.

==Support==
Paul Wolfowitz, a prominent neoconservative, promoted Mylroie&#x27;s theories during his time as a Bush administration official. Joseph Shattan, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, called Mylroie &quot;one of America&#x27;s leading students of terrorism.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Book World&quot; included &quot;Study of Revenge&quot; among its &quot;Expert&#x27;s Picks&quot; following the 9/11 attacks.

The &quot;Middle East Intelligence Bulletin&quot;, reviewing &quot;Study of Revenge&quot; before 9/11, called it a &quot;must read,&quot; explaining, &quot;This reviewer believes that Mylroie has correctly pinpointed Saddam Hussein as the source of terrorist attacks on Americans, including the World Trade Center bombing... The Clinton administration, wittingly or unwittingly, has chosen the path of self-delusion: to not investigate the matter seriously...[T]he failure of U.S. officials to address the question of state sponsorship of terrorism will have significant future costs. It encourages future terrorist attacks by eliminating the costs of retribution from the calculations of leaders such as Saddam Hussein.&quot;

==Criticism==
Mylroie has been criticized by many terrorism experts. CNN reporter Peter Bergen called Mylroie a &quot;crackpot&quot; and criticized her belief that &quot;Saddam was not only behind the &#x27;93 Trade Center attack, but also every anti-American terrorist incident of the past decade, from the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the leveling of the federal building in Oklahoma City to September 11 itself.&quot; Bergen states that Mylroie&#x27;s argument depends entirely on

Bergen goes on to state that &quot;an avalanche of evidence&quot; refutes Mylroie&#x27;s basic assumption.

Daniel Benjamin, a former Clinton administration official and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, points out that &quot;Mylroie&#x27;s work has been carefully investigated by the CIA and the FBI... The most knowledgeable analysts and investigators at the CIA and at the FBI believe that their work conclusively disproves Mylroie&#x27;s claims... Nonetheless, she has remained a star in the neoconservative firmament.&quot;

Daniel Pipes derided her view, saying that it was &quot;a tour de force, but it&#x27;s a tour de force of alchemy. It has a fundamentally wrong premise.&quot; According to Andrew C. McCarthy, who prosecuted Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman in 1995, &quot;Mylroie&#x27;s theory was loopy... Leaving aside various other implausibilities in her surmise, the government had several sources who knew Basit as Basit both before and after the time he spent in Kuwait.&quot;

David Plotz is also among Mylroie&#x27;s critics. He writes:

While Angelo Codevilla, professor emeritus of international relations at Boston University, called Mylroie&#x27;s book &quot;Bush vs. the Beltway&quot; &quot;the best available account of the reasoning behind the conduct of the war on terror&quot;, he also stated &quot;But it is based on a faulty premise, the one implicit in its title: that presidents neither control nor reform their bureaucracies... If all presidents are equally beset by bureaucrats, then Bush can be excused, even praised, for making U.S. policy come out no worse than it has.&quot;

==Mylroie–McCarthy debate==
In 2008, Laurie Mylroie, writing in the &quot;New York Sun&quot;, reviewed &quot;Willful Blindness&quot; by Andrew C. McCarthy, who had prosecuted Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman in 1995. Mylroie explained that Rahman had not ordered the bombing of the World Trade Center—nor was he charged with doing so. She also explained that other elements of the plot had been organized by Sudan, as the trial transcript made clear. She complained that McCarthy understated &quot;the degree to which the extremists were penetrated by the intelligence agencies of several states.&quot; She argued that this was the basic flaw of the Clinton era handling of terrorism: it focused on the arrest and trial of perps and ignored state sponsorship.

Replying on &quot;National Review Online&quot;, McCarthy accused Mylroie of misunderstanding &quot;the difference between intrigue and evidence, between history and prosecution.&quot; Calling Rahman &quot;the central figure in the overarching conspiracy,&quot; he wrote: &quot;At trial, we proved that Sheikh Abdel Rahman had close ties to Hassan al-Turabi, leader in the early 1990s of Sudan&#x27;s de facto government, the National Islamic Front.&quot; At this point, Daniel Pipes wrote a blog entry attacking &quot;Laurie Mylroie&#x27;s Shoddy, Loopy, Zany Theories.&quot; Stephen F. Hayes of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; added: &quot;no one I know took her arguments very seriously.&quot;

Mylroie responded to McCarthy, saying that McCarthy himself had written in his book that the original case against Rahman was &quot;weak&quot; and so, she wrote, &quot;different acts of violence, including the WTC bombing, were somewhat artificially linked&quot; to strengthen the charges against him. She emphasized McCarthy&#x27;s comment that Rahman was never charged with the &quot;substantive crime&quot; of bombing the World Trade Center. The debate continued in the &quot;New York Sun&quot;.

==1980s support for Saddam==
Early in her career, Mylroie advocated support for Iraq in the context of its war and rivalry with Iran. In 1988, just before the cease-fire to the Iran–Iraq War, she published an article in the journal &quot;Orbis&quot;, advocating &quot;The Baghdad Alternative,&quot; which involved bolstering U.S. ties to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Ken Silverstein gave this summary:

:Saddam was implementing a policy of economic &quot;perestroika&quot; and political &quot;glasnost,&quot; according to Mylroie. Iraqi officials she interviewed told her that Saddam was &quot;much concerned about democracy. ... He thinks that is healthy,&quot; and she suggested this was &quot;not just idle chatter.&quot; From an American perspective, Mylroie concluded, &quot;the more Saddam Hussein exercises control over the Baath Party, including the ideologues, the better.&quot; She proposed that the Bush (Senior) Administration, already favoring Iraq against Iran, should offer Iraq more support in exchange for overt Iraqi support for U.S. Middle East policy goals. &quot;Iraq and the United States,&quot; she wrote, &quot;need each other.&quot;

Michael Isikoff and David Corn wrote in 2006:
:Mylroie continued to advocate engaging Saddam, even after the Iraqi dictator slaughtered tens of thousands of Kurds in what became known as the Anfal campaign of 1987 and 1988. In May 1989, Mylroie wrote in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; that Israel and the United States should not &#x27;poke&#x27; Iraq &#x27;with a stick&#x27; and should refrain from tossing &#x27;idle threats and harsh words&#x27; at Baghdad. She suggested Iraq might become a benign, if not positive, presence in the region.

Isikoff and Corn argued that Mylroie &quot;was looking to change the region through back-channel, private diplomacy – and she aspired to be a behind-the-scenes peacemaker who would broker a deal between Saddam and Israel.&quot; To this end, she met with Iraqi officials including Tariq Aziz. After Saddam&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, however, the would-be diplomat &quot;turned against the dictator she had once wanted Washington to help, with the passion of one who felt personally betrayed.&quot;

In October 1990, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak mentioned Mylroie&#x27;s trips to Baghdad and Israel, which she later denied. Isikoff and Corn, however, interviewed five of her former associates (including Judith Miller) who all &quot;confirmed that she had been a secret go-between for Baghdad and Jerusalem.&quot;

<doc id="561580" wikidata="Q1423964" url="?curid=561580" title="Necronym">
<text>A necronym (from the Greek words νεκρός, &quot;nekros&quot;, &quot;dead,&quot; and ὄνομα, &quot;ónoma&quot;, &quot;name&quot;) is the name of or a reference to a person who has died. Many cultures have taboos and traditions associated with referring to the deceased, ranging from at one extreme never again speaking the person&#x27;s real name, bypassing it often by way of , to, at the other end, mass commemoration via naming other things or people after the deceased.

For instance, in some cultures it is common for a newborn child to receive the name (a necronym) of a relative who has recently died, while in others to reuse such a name would be considered extremely inappropriate or even forbidden. While this varies from culture to culture, the use of necronyms is quite common.

== Use ==
In Ashkenazi Jewish culture, it is a custom to name a child after a beloved relative who died as a way of honoring the deceased. Often the child will share the same Hebrew name as the namesake but not the given name in the vernacular language (e.g. English). For most practicing Jews it is taboo to name a child after a person who is still living.

In Japan, Buddhist families usually obtain a necronym, called a &quot;kaimyō&quot;, for a deceased relative from a Buddhist priest in exchange for a donation to the temple. Traditionally, the deceased were thereafter referred to by the necronym, as a sign of pious respect. This name was often the only one inscribed on gravestones in the past, though now it is more common to have the necronym in addition to the given name.

In Assyria and Babylonia, children were often given &quot;substitute-names,&quot; necronyms of deceased family members, to keep the dead&#x27;s names and identities alive. Evidence suggests that the desire for children may have been motivated by the desire to pass on these necronyms.

During the Cold War, necronyms were commonly used as a means of protecting an intelligence officer&#x27;s true identity. For example, the Soviet KGB agent Konon Molody was only known as Gordon Lonsdale (the true Lonsdale was a Canadian born two years after Molody who died in 1943 when he was 19) in the United States. Molody adopted the name when he was 32, 11 years after the real Lonsdale&#x27;s death.

==Historiography==
The practice of bestowing necronyms has sometimes caused confusion for historians. This is primarily because of the two birth certificates or records that could be present at a given time. This confusion often stems from the inability to differentiate between the records of each child. One such example is the case of Shigechiyo Izumi (1865?–1986), accepted in 1986 as the world&#x27;s oldest man by &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot;; it is suggested that he was possibly born in 1880 and the birth certificate of a brother whose name he assumed upon his death was submitted in place of Izumi&#x27;s own.

== Examples ==

* Composer Ludwig van Beethoven, born in 1770, had a brother named Ludwig Maria who was born in 1769 and lived for only six days.
* Vincent van Gogh had a brother of the same name who was born, and died, on March 30, 1852, exactly one year before the painter&#x27;s birth.
* Artist Salvador Dalí was born nine months and ten days after his brother, also named Salvador, died from gastroenteritis at the age of one year and nine months.
* NASCAR driver John Hunter Nemechek was named after his uncle John Nemechek, who died in a crash at Homestead-Miami Speedway about three months before John Hunter was born.
* Musician Richard David James, known better as Aphex Twin, claims he had a stillborn older brother named Richard, from whom he inherited his name. The Aphex Twin moniker is also a tribute to his legacy, though this fact in general might be fabricated.

<doc id="561582" wikidata="Q1095305" url="?curid=561582" title="Negative gearing">
<text>Negative gearing is a form of financial leverage whereby an investor borrows money to acquire an income-producing investment and the gross income generated by the investment (at least in the short term) is less than the cost of owning and managing the investment, including depreciation and interest charged on the loan (but excluding capital repayments). The investor may enter into a negatively geared investment expecting tax benefits or the capital gain on the investment after it is sold to exceed the accumulated losses of holding the investment. The investor would take into account the tax treatment of negative gearing, which may generate additional benefits to the investor in the form of tax benefits if the loss on a negatively geared investment is tax-deductible against the investor&#x27;s other taxable income and if the capital gain on the sale is given a favourable tax treatment.

==Overview==
Negative gearing is often discussed with regard to real estate, where rental income is less than mortgage loan interest costs, but may also apply to shares in companies whose dividend income falls short of interest costs on a margin loan. The tax treatment may or may not be the same between the two.

Positive gearing occurs when one borrows to invest in an income-producing asset and the returns (income) from that asset exceed the cost of borrowing. From then on, the investor must pay tax on the rental income profit until the asset is sold, at which point the investor must pay capital gains tax on any profit.

When the income generated covers the interest, it is simply a geared investment, which creates passive income. A negative gearing strategy makes a profit under any of the following circumstances:

*if the asset rises in value so that the capital gain is more than the sum of the ongoing losses over the life of the investment;
*if the income stream rises to become greater than the cost of interest (the investment becomes positively geared); or
*if the interest cost falls because of lower interest rates or paying down the loan principal, making the investment positively geared.

The investor must be able to fund any shortfall until the asset is sold or until the investment becomes positively geared. The different tax treatment of planned ongoing losses and possible future capital gains affects the investor&#x27;s final return. In countries that tax capital gains at a lower rate than income, it is possible for an investor to make a loss overall before taxation but a small gain after taxpayer subsidies.

Some countries, including Australia and Japan, allow unrestricted use of negative gearing losses to offset income from other sources. Several other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, including the United States of America, New Zealand, Germany, Sweden, Canada, and France, allow loss offsetting with some restrictions. Applying tax deductions from negatively geared investment housing to other income is not permitted in the United Kingdom or the Netherlands. With respect to investment decisions and market prices, other taxes such as stamp duties and capital gains tax may be more or less onerous in those countries, increasing or decreasing the attractiveness of residential property as an investment.

A negatively-geared investment property will generally remain negatively geared for several years, when the rental income will have increased with inflation to the point that the investment is positively geared (the rental income is greater than the interest cost).

The tax treatment of negative gearing (also termed &quot;rental loss offset against other income&quot;) varies. For example:
* the United States restricts the practice to lower/middle income taxpayers who are active in managing their rental investment and also allows interest costs against the family home to be fully tax deductible.
* Canada limits the practice by ensuring the investment generated a positive return over its life.
* countries with lower tax rates have a lower benefit from negative gearing due to a lower top rate of tax or a higher threshold for a specific tax rate.

==Taxation implications of negative gearing by country==

===Australia===

Negative gearing can be a tax-effective strategy in Australia, because the tax system has a single income tax schedule for income from all sources. This means that for taxation purposes net investment income losses can be offset against other types of income, such as wage or business income, with only a few limits or restrictions.

Negative gearing continues to be a controversial political issue in Australia and was a major issue during the 2016 Australian federal election and the 2019 Australian federal election, during which the Australian Labor Party proposed to eliminate the tax-deductibility of negative gearing losses against non-investment income (with some exceptions), and to halve the capital gains tax discount to 25%. Analysis found that negative gearing in Australia provides a greater benefit to wealthier Australians than the less wealthy.

Federal Treasurer at the time, Scott Morrison, in defence of negative gearing, cited tax data that showed that numerous middle income groups (he mentioned teachers, nurses, and electricians) benefit in larger numbers from negative gearing than finance managers.

===United Kingdom===
While allowing for negative gearing in its basic form, the United Kingdom does not allow the transfer of one type of income (or loss) to another type of income. This is due to its schedular system of taxation. In this type of taxation system, the tax paid is dependent on income source. Therefore, an individual who received an income from labour and from land would pay two separate tax rates for the two relevant income sources.

Between 1997 and 2007, the Tax Law Rewrite Project changed this system by simplifying the schedules. As with the previous system, people would not be allowed to transfer incomes (or losses).

A UK government online resource on renting out property in England and Wales outlines how to offset losses. It states that losses can be offset against &quot;future profits by carrying it forward to a later year&quot; or against &quot;profits from other properties (if you have them)&quot;.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand abolished negative gearing in March 2021 and it will be fully phased out by April 2025.

The Rental Income Guide states a loss can only be deducted against other incomes if the rental income is at market rate.

The Opposition Labour Party attempted to raise negative gearing in the 2011 election, but after their failure to win government the issue reduced in significance.

New Zealand now has ring-fencing rules, abolishing negative gearing in the residential property market. Residential property deductions can only be made against residential property income and cannot be deducted from income from other sources, e.g. wages.

===Canada===

Canada allows the transfer of income streams in some situations. 

Personal business expenses may always be deducted from personal business income. If those expenses exceed business incomes (i.e., the business is losing money for tax purposes), the resulting &quot;non-capital loss&quot; may be deducted from other personal incomes, so long as the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) believes that it is a genuine business (and not a personal activity being used to generate tax losses). This loss may also be carried back up to 3 years, or carried forward up to 20 years, to offset income earned in those years. 

Interest paid on a loan can be treated as a business expense, so long as the money was borrowed to generate income. Claim the following carrying charges and interest you paid to earn income from investments: [...] Most interest you pay on money you borrow for investment purposes, but generally only if you use it to try to earn investment income, including interest and dividends. However, if the only earnings your investment can produce are capital gains, you cannot claim the interest you paid.

===United States===
In principle, the US federal tax does not allow the transfer of income streams. In general, taxpayers can only deduct expenses of renting property from their rental income, as renting property out is usually considered a passive activity. However, if renters are considered to have actively participated in the activities, they can claim deductions from rental losses against their other &quot;nonpassive income&quot;. A definition of &quot;active participation&quot; is outlined in the &quot;Reporting Rental Income, Expenses, and Losses&quot; guide:You actively participated in a rental real estate activity if you (and your spouse) owned at least 10% of the rental property and you made management decisions or arranged for others to provide services (such as repairs) in a significant and &quot;bona fide&quot; sense. Management decisions that may count as active participation include approving new tenants, deciding on rental terms, approving expenditures, and other similar decisions.It is possible to deduct any loss against other incomes, depending on a range of factors.

===Japan===
Japan allows tax payers to offset rental losses against other income.

Individuals can claim losses against rental loss with minimal restrictions, but if the property was owned through a partnership or trust there are restrictions.

There are a number of additional rules, such as restricting claims of losses due to Bad Debt. Additional information can be found in the Japan Tax Site.

===Germany===
The German tax system is complex, but within the bounds of standard federal income tax, Germany does allow the transfer of income under certain conditions. Rental losses can be offset against rental income and against income from other income streams including employment income, income from independent personal services and trade and business income. In order for losses from renting and leasing to be offset against income or profits from other types of income, it must be established that there is an intention to generate a profit from the source of income generating the losses. In the case of real estate that is rented out for regular residential purposes, the German tax authorities generally assume an intention to generate a profit, unless the real estate is rented out at unusual low conditions (less than 2/3 of a comparable rent). 

Germany recognises seven sources of income:

# Agriculture and forestry
# Trade and business
# Independent personal services
# Employment
# Capital investment
# Rents and royalties
# &quot;other income&quot;, as specified and strictly limited by law to certain types of income such as income from private transactions and income of a recurring nature (e.g. pensions)

The income from each of these sources is calculated separately.

Rental income is taxed as income and is subject to the progressive tax rate. Interest on loans provided to finance real estate, expenses, and property-related cost (e.g., management fees, insurance) can be deducted from the taxable rental income.

If real estate is held as private assets (i.e. not as a business asset), the gain from the sale of a property after a holding period of more than 10 years is generally tax-free respectively does not constitute taxable income. However, there are exceptions to this rule, e.g. it is assumed that the sale of three &quot;objects&quot; (individual properties, real estate or rights equivalent to real estate) within 5 years constitutes a business activity and that the income generated from the sale is therefore business income and not possibly tax-exempt &quot;other income&quot;.

===Netherlands===
In principle, the Dutch tax system does not allow the transfer of income. Most citizens calculate tax, separately, in 3 income groups:
# Box 1 income includes income from employment and income from the primary residence
# Box 2 income, which includes income from a substantial holding in a company, as well as gains from substantial shareholdings
# Box 3 deals with income from savings and investments

Dutch resident and non-resident companies and partnerships owning Dutch property are in principle allowed to deduct interest expenses on loans from banks or affiliated companies, and property-related costs from their taxable income.

<doc id="561585" wikidata="Q922367" url="?curid=561585" title="Master theorem (analysis of algorithms)">
<text>In the analysis of algorithms, the master theorem for divide-and-conquer recurrences provides an asymptotic analysis for many recurrence relations that occur in the analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms. The approach was first presented by Jon Bentley, Dorothea Blostein (née Haken), and James B. Saxe in 1980, where it was described as a &quot;unifying method&quot; for solving such recurrences. The name &quot;master theorem&quot; was popularized by the widely used algorithms textbook &quot;Introduction to Algorithms&quot; by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.

Not all recurrence relations can be solved by this theorem; its generalizations include the Akra–Bazzi method.

== Introduction ==
Consider a problem that can be solved using a recursive algorithm such as the following:

 procedure p(input &quot;x&quot; of size &quot;n&quot;):
 if &quot;n&quot; &lt; some constant &quot;k&quot;:
 Solve &quot;x&quot; directly without recursion
 else:
 Create &quot;a&quot; subproblems of &quot;x&quot;, each having size &quot;n&quot;/&quot;b&quot;
 Call procedure &quot;p&quot; recursively on each subproblem
 Combine the results from the subproblems
The above algorithm divides the problem into a number () of subproblems recursively, each subproblem being of size . The factor by which the size of subproblems is reduced () need not, in general, be the same as the number of subproblems (). Its solution tree has a node for each recursive call, with the children of that node being the other calls made from that call. The leaves of the tree are the base cases of the recursion, the subproblems (of size less than &quot;k&quot;) that do not recurse. The above example would have child nodes at each non-leaf node. Each node does an amount of work that corresponds to the size of the subproblem passed to that instance of the recursive call and given by formula_1. The total amount of work done by the entire algorithm is the sum of the work performed by all the nodes in the tree.

The runtime of an algorithm such as the above on an input of size , usually denoted formula_2, can be expressed by the recurrence relation
:formula_3
where formula_4 is the time to create the subproblems and combine their results in the above procedure. This equation can be successively substituted into itself and expanded to obtain an expression for the total amount of work done. The master theorem allows many recurrence relations of this form to be converted to Θ-notation directly, without doing an expansion of the recursive relation.

== Generic form ==

The master theorem always yields asymptotically tight bounds to recurrences from divide and conquer algorithms that partition an input into smaller subproblems of equal sizes, solve the subproblems recursively, and then combine the subproblem solutions to give a solution to the original problem. The time for such an algorithm can be expressed by adding the work that they perform at the top level of their recursion (to divide the problems into subproblems and then combine the subproblem solutions) together with the time made in the recursive calls of the algorithm. If formula_2 denotes the total time for the algorithm on an input of size formula_6, and formula_1 denotes the amount of time taken at the top level of the recurrence then the time can be expressed by a recurrence relation that takes the form:
:formula_8
Here formula_6 is the size of an input problem, formula_10 is the number of subproblems in the recursion, and formula_11 is the factor by which the subproblem size is reduced in each recursive call (formula_12). Crucially, formula_10 and formula_11 must not depend on formula_6. The theorem below also assumes that, as a base case for the recurrence, formula_16 when formula_6 is less than some bound formula_18, the smallest input size that will lead to a recursive call.

Recurrences of this form often satisfy one of the three following regimes, based on how the work to split/recombine the problem formula_1 relates to the &quot;critical exponent&quot; formula_20. (The table below uses standard big O notation). Throughout, formula_21 is used for clarity, though in textbooks this is usually rendered formula_22.

:formula_23

A useful extension of Case 2 handles all values of formula_24:

=== Examples ===

==== Case 1 example ====
:formula_25

As one can see from the formula above:

:formula_26, so
:formula_27, where formula_28

Next, we see if we satisfy the case 1 condition:
:formula_29.

It follows from the first case of the master theorem that

:formula_30

(This result is confirmed by the exact solution of the recurrence relation, which is formula_31, assuming formula_32).

==== Case 2 example ====
formula_33

As we can see in the formula above the variables get the following values:

:formula_34
:formula_35 where formula_36
Next, we see if we satisfy the case 2 condition:
:formula_37, and therefore, c and formula_38 are equal

So it follows from the second case of the master theorem:

:formula_39

Thus the given recurrence relation formula_2 was in formula_41.

(This result is confirmed by the exact solution of the recurrence relation, which is formula_42, assuming formula_32).

==== Case 3 example ====
:formula_44

As we can see in the formula above the variables get the following values:

:formula_45
:formula_46, where formula_28

Next, we see if we satisfy the case 3 condition:
:formula_37, and therefore, yes, formula_49

The regularity condition also holds:

:formula_50, choosing formula_51

So it follows from the third case of the master theorem:

:formula_52

Thus the given recurrence relation formula_2 was in formula_54, that complies with the formula_1 of the original formula.

(This result is confirmed by the exact solution of the recurrence relation, which is formula_56, assuming formula_32.)

== Inadmissible equations==
The following equations cannot be solved using the master theorem:

*formula_58
*:&quot;a&quot; is not a constant; the number of subproblems should be fixed
*formula_59
*:non-polynomial difference between formula_1 and formula_61 (see below; extended version applies)
*formula_62
*:formula_1, which is the combination time, is not positive
*formula_64
*:case 3 but regularity violation.

In the second inadmissible example above, the difference between formula_1 and formula_61 can be expressed with the ratio formula_67. It is clear that formula_68 for any constant formula_69. Therefore, the difference is not polynomial and the basic form of the Master Theorem does not apply. The extended form (case 2b) does apply, giving the solution formula_70.

<text>The British Railways Board (BRB) was a nationalised industry in the United Kingdom that operated from 1963 to 2001. Until 1997, it was responsible for most railway services in Great Britain, trading under the brand name British Railways and, from 1965, British Rail. It did not operate railways in Northern Ireland, where railways were the responsibility of the Government of Northern Ireland.

It is a statutory corporation, which when operating consisted of a chairman and nine to fifteen other members appointed by the Secretary of State for Transport. The Board, now reduced to a minimum membership of a chairman and one other member, continues to exist to hold the French law benefits and obligations of the Channel Tunnel Rail Usage Contract.

==Formation==
The BRB was created on 1 January 1963 under the Transport Act 1962 by Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Conservative government to inherit the railway responsibilities of the British Transport Commission, which was dissolved at the same time.

==Operations==
Initially, and for the majority of its history, the BRB operated under the structure inherited from the BTC Railway Executive. Operations were initially divided into six regions – Eastern, London Midland, North Eastern, Western, Southern and Scottish (later rebranded ScotRail). The North Eastern region was merged into the Eastern Region in 1967.

In the 1980s, the BRB moved to a sectoral model based on business activity – InterCity for long-distance passenger trains, Network SouthEast for commuter trains in London, and Regional Railways for short-distance and commuter trains outside the Network SouthEast area. Railfreight was organised separately.

As well as the railway network, for much of its history the BRB also ran ferry services (later as Sealink) and hotels. These were sold in the 1980s.

The final BRB structure (1994–1997) was a shadow form of the future privatised railway industry, becoming a holding company for over 100 subsidiaries, including 25 passenger train operating, six freight, three rolling stock leasing, and a number of track maintenance companies. These were slowly sold during privatisation (the passenger subsidiaries were franchised to private sector concerns).

==Winding down==

On 1 April 1994, railway infrastructure became the responsibility of public limited company Railtrack, initially Government owned. The BRB continued to operate all trains until 1996, when the process of transferring them to the private sector began.

Privatisation was completed in 1997, but the BRB continued to discharge residual functions relating to non-operational railway land and BR pensions, and to have responsibility for the British Transport Police. In 1999 Alistair Morton was appointed the last chairman of the BRB, which began to advise on passenger railway matters. During this time it operated with the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising under the trading name of the &quot;Shadow Strategic Rail Authority&quot;.

Under the Transport Act 2000, the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising was abolished and the majority of BRB&#x27;s functions were transferred to the Strategic Rail Authority&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary BRB (Residuary) Limited. In 2001 the minimum membership of the Board itself was reduced to the chairman and one other member. With the dissolution of the SRA under the Railways Act 2005, BRB (Residuary) became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Secretary of State for Transport. While the Transport Act allowed for BRB to be abolished, the Board&#x27;s remaining function is to hold the French law benefits and obligations of the Channel Tunnel Rail Usage Contract on trust for the Secretary of State for Transport. In this function it has outlived its own residuary company, which was wound up on until 30 September 2013, pursuant to the Public Bodies review.

Through its subsidiary Rail Property Ltd, BRB (Residuary) retained responsibility for non-operational railway land, for example railway lines closed in the Beeching Axe that have not been sold.

The BRB owned a large amount of archive material, including papers, maps, films and photographs, dating back before nationalisation. In 1997 these were distributed to other bodies: films (the bulk of which had been produced by British Transport Films) to the British Film Institute in London, photographs to the National Railway Museum (NRM) in York, and most papers to the Public Record Office.

<doc id="561590" wikidata="Q331466" url="?curid=561590" title="Positive pressure">
<text>Positive pressure is a pressure within a system that is greater than the environment that surrounds that system. Consequently, if there is any leak from the positively pressured system, it will egress into the surrounding environment. This is in contrast to a negative pressure room, where air is sucked in.

Use is also made of positive pressure to ensure there is no ingress of the environment into a supposed closed system. A typical example of the use of positive pressure is the location of a habitat in an area where there may exist flammable gases such as those found on an oil platform or laboratory cleanroom. This kind of positive pressure is also used in operating theaters and &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilisation (IVF) labs.

Hospitals may have positive pressure rooms for patients with compromised immune systems. Air will flow out of the room instead of in, so that any airborne microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) that may infect the patient are kept away.

This process is important in human and chick development. Positive pressure, created by the closure of anterior and posterior neuropores of the neural tube during neurulation, is a requirement of brain development.

Amphibians use this process to respire, whereby they use positive pressure to inflate their lungs.

== Historic utility ==

=== Industrial utility ===
Industrial use of positive pressure systems are commonly used to ventilate confined spaces with dust, fumes, pollutants and/or high temperatures 

=== Clinical utility ===
Many hospitals are equipped with negative and positive pressure rooms just for the purposes described. Negative pressure rooms are used to help keep airborne pathogens (eg. aerosolized COVID-19 and active TB) from escaping into surrounding areas, thereby preventing the spread of airborne pathogens to outside the room. Positive pressure rooms are used for immunocompromised persons (eg. Neutropenic) whereby controlled quality air is sent into the room to prevent random (and potentially polluted) air from entering the room. The CDC recommends a positive pressure differential of at least 2.5 Pa between the positively pressured room and the adjoining hallway.

<text>The British Transport Commission (BTC) was created by Clement Attlee&#x27;s post-war Labour government as a part of its nationalisation programme, to oversee railways, canals and road freight transport in Great Britain (Northern Ireland had the separate Ulster Transport Authority). Its general duty under the Transport Act 1947 was to provide an efficient, adequate, economical and properly integrated system of public inland transport and port facilities within Great Britain for passengers and goods, excluding transport by air.

The BTC came into operation on 1 January 1948. Its first chairman was Lord Hurcomb, with Miles Beevor as Chief Secretary. Its main holdings were the networks and assets of the Big Four national regional railway companies: the Great Western Railway, London and North Eastern Railway, London, Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway. It also took over 55 other railway undertakings, 19 canal undertakings and 246 road haulage firms, as well as the work of the London Passenger Transport Board, which was already publicly owned. The nationalisation package also included the fleets of &#x27;private owner wagons&#x27;, which industrial concerns had used to transport goods on the railway networks.

==Organisation==
The BTC was one of the largest industrial organisations in the world and it owned a vast number of transport-related assets. The assets owned at its creation included: of railway track, 1,260,000 freight and service railway vehicles, 40,000 passenger railway coaches, 20,148 locomotives, 93,000 road vehicles, of canals, 122 steamships, 54 hotels and 52,000 houses. In March 1953, it had 877,000 staff.

At first, the Commission did not directly operate transport services, which were the responsibility of the Commission&#x27;s Executives. These bodies were separately appointed, and operated under what were termed &#x27;schemes of delegation&#x27;. The Act provided for five Executives, covering Docks &amp; Inland Waterways, Hotels, London Transport, Railways, and Road Transport.
The Railway Executive traded as &quot;British Railways&quot;. In 1949, Road Transport was divided into separate Road Haulage and Road Passenger Executives, though the latter proved short-lived.

The Commission&#x27;s extensive activities included:
* British Transport Advertising sold space on premises and vehicles.
* Buses: the Tilling Group sold its bus interests to the BTC in September 1948, as did the Red and White Group in 1950. Midland General buses and trolleybuses were transferred by the British Electricity Authority. From the railway companies, the BTC also inherited non-controlling interests in many bus companies in the British Electric Traction Group. It also manufactured buses for its own use, through the subsidiaries Bristol Tramways (from 1955 Bristol Commercial Vehicles) and Eastern Coach Works. In London and the surrounding area, the BTC ran both the (red) London buses and the (green) country buses, including Green Line Coaches.
* Docks: British Transport Docks (today known as Associated British Ports), comprising 32 ports taken over from the railway companies.
* Films: the BTC had its own film production company, British Transport Films.
* Hotels &amp; Catering: the former railway hotels and catering departments initially came under the control of the Railway Executive, but on 1 July 1948 they were transferred to the Hotels Executive. Between 1953 and 1963, they operated as British Transport Hotel and Catering Services; and in 1963 it became the British Transport Hotels.
* Museums: The BTC inherited the LNER&#x27;s Railway Museum at York and appointed a Curator of Historical Relics to build up a national collection. Eventually, much of this collection was displayed at the Museum of British Transport at Clapham, south London. This closed in the early 1970s and was superseded by the National Railway Museum at York and the London Transport Museum (now in Covent Garden). The BTC also established the Stoke Bruerne Canal Museum.
* Police: the British Transport Commission Police (BTCP) – see British Transport Police for details and dates – was formed chiefly by the amalgamation of the various railway constabularies.
* Railways: British Railways, including ancillary activities like engineering workshops, and London Underground. The former LMS lines in Northern Ireland (see Northern Counties Committee) were sold to the Ulster Transport Authority in 1949.
* Road Haulage: the local road distribution networks of the pre-nationalisation rail companies, plus the removals company Pickfords, which the railways had owned jointly. To these were added numerous smaller independent concerns taken over at nationalisation, comprising all undertakings predominantly engaged in ordinary long-distance work for distances of or upwards. These networks were later re-organised as British Road Services (BRS).
* Shipping: the former railway steamer services, primarily to France and Ireland and around the Scottish coast, and investments in Associated Humber Lines and the Atlantic Steam Navigation Company.
* Tramways: the South London tramways of London Transport, all of which were abandoned by 5 July 1952.
* Travel &amp; Holidays: the travel agents Thomas Cook &amp; Son.
* Waterways: canals and navigable rivers, mainly taken over from canal companies, like the Grand Union Canal Carrying Company and Fellows Morton &amp; Clayton, but also including those bought out earlier by the pre-nationalisation railways. The Caledonian Canal was already state-owned. The canals are today run by the Canal and River Trust and Scottish Canals. As well as the canal infrastructure, BTC also managed canal carrying services.

The Commission was permitted to &quot;secure the provision&quot; of road passenger services, although it did not have the general powers of compulsory purchase of bus operators. To obtain specific powers of acquisition it had first to draw up, and get approval for, a &#x27;Road Scheme&#x27;, area by area. Only one was published, the North East Area Road Scheme, though work began on a second scheme, covering East Anglia. The NEARS was never confirmed, as it was fiercely opposed by private and municipal operators.

The quasi-federal structure of Commission and Executives proved to be an obstacle to integration and was largely abolished by the Conservative government with effect from 1 October 1953 (the London Transport Executive alone survived). On 1 January 1955, the railways were re-organised on the basis of six Area Railway Boards, which had a wide measure of operational autonomy under the Commission&#x27;s overall supervision. The Commission took direct charge of the remaining assets, though these were significantly reduced by the Conservatives de-nationalising much of the road haulage sector. On 1 January 1955, separate managements were also set up for road haulage, hotels, docks and inland waterways.

==Abolition==
By the late 1950s the BTC was in serious financial difficulties, largely due to the economic performance of the railways. It was criticised as an overly bureaucratic system of administering transport services and had failed to develop an integrated transport system (such as integrated ticketing and timetabling). It was abolished by Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Conservative government under the Transport Act 1962 and replaced by five successor bodies:
*British Railways Board (railways, hotels and some shipping)
*British Transport Docks Board (docks)
*British Waterways Board (inland waterways)
*London Transport Board (London buses and the London Underground)
*Transport Holding Company (remaining interests, in shipping, travel and road transport)

These changes took effect on 1 January 1963. Notwithstanding the abolition of the BTC, the British Transport Police continues to exist, and the BTC heraldic shield is still displayed on the force&#x27;s badge.

==Chairmen==
* 1947 – 1953: Sir Cyril Hurcomb
* 1953 – 1961: Gen. Sir Brian Robertson, Bt.
* 1961 – 1965: Dr. Richard Beeching

<doc id="561594" wikidata="Q2127685" url="?curid=561594" title="Railways Act 1993">
<text>The Railways Act 1993 (c. 43) was introduced by John Major&#x27;s Conservative government and passed on 5 November 1993. It provided for the restructuring of the British Railways Board (BRB), the public corporation that owned and operated the national railway system.

==Background==
While the administration of Margaret Thatcher had not done so, the Major government were determined to privatise British Rail. Railways in the 18th and 19th centuries had originally been built and run with private capital, but subsidised heavily by Parliament and communities who gave land for building through compulsory purchase. Rail was increasingly regulated, for instance under the Railways Act 1921, but was finally nationalised by the Transport Act 1947. Calls for reform of the nationalised system combined with people who believed only the private sector could run rail to ensure better service for passengers at less cost. This led to the Railways Act 1993.

==Contents==
The legislation created a new regulatory regime for the railways, with the establishment of the Rail Regulator (dealing with the monopoly and dominant elements of the industry, principally Railtrack) and the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising, whose role was to sell passenger rail franchises to the private sector.

A few residual responsibilities of the British Railways Board remained with BRB (Residuary) Ltd.

==Subsequent events==
The legislation enabled the Secretary of State for Transport John MacGregor to transfer separated parts of the railway to the private sector. Passenger rail services were franchised to private companies including Virgin Rail Group, Connex and the coach companies Stagecoach and National Express, and the national railway track and signalling company Railtrack was floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. British Rail&#x27;s track maintenance and renewal operations were sold to private companies, with contracts to provide infrastructure services to Railtrack. The three rolling stock leasing companies or ROSCOs, owners of the passenger rolling stock, were sold to management buyout teams.

The Director of Passenger Rail Franchising was replaced in 2001 by the Strategic Rail Authority. When the SRA was abolished in 2006, franchising was taken over by the Secretary of State for Transport. The statutory position of Rail Regulator was abolished in July 2004 and his functions were taken over by the Office of Rail Regulation.

===Railtrack===
Railtrack collapsed in highly controversial circumstances in October 2001, and in October 2002 the company emerged from railway administration, a special state of insolvency for railway companies created by the Railways Act 1993, as Network Rail. Some commentators regard the creation of Network Rail and its taking maintenance in-house as the beginning of the reversal of rail privatisation.

==Amendments==
The legislation has been amended several times, most significantly by the Transport Act 2000, the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 and the Railways Act 2005. The Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Act 2024 greatly altered the sections concerning passenger rail franchising, as the Labour government took passenger operations into public ownership.

<text>Battlefield Vietnam is a 2004 first-person shooter video game developed by Digital Illusions Canada and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows. It is the second installment of the &quot;Battlefield&quot; franchise, coming after &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;. &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; takes place during the Vietnam War and features a large variety of maps based on historical settings, such as the Ho Chi Minh Trail, Battle of Huế, Ia Drang Valley, Operation Flaming Dart, the Battle of Khe Sanh and Fall of Saigon. On 15 March 2005, EA re-released the game as Battlefield Vietnam: Redux, which includes new vehicles, maps and an EA-produced World War II mod, based on the previous installment &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;.

==Gameplay==
In the game&#x27;s playable maps, the player&#x27;s primary objective is to occupy Control Points to enable allies and controllable vehicles to spawn. &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; employs similar point-by-point objectives to its prequel, &quot;Battlefield 1942,&quot; as well as a form of asymmetrical warfare gameplay. The two teams, the U.S. and North Vietnam, are provided different equipment and vehicles. The U.S. relies on heavy vehicles, employing heavy tanks, helicopters, and bombers. The Vietnamese rely on infantry tactics, utilizing anti-tank weapons. The developers intended to reflect the actual conditions of war throughout the game. The game features a &quot;Sipi Hole&quot; as a mobile spawn point, which is representative of the vast tunnel networks utilized by Vietnam forces. Similar to previous games in the &quot;Battlefield&quot; series, spawn tickets (reinforcements) play a vital role in defeating the opposing team. 

&quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; features the United States with Marines, Army and the Navy; South Vietnam with Army of the Republic of Vietnam; and North Vietnam with People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam and the Viet Cong.

Built on a modified version of the &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot; engine, &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; has new and improved features compared to its predecessor. The game gives the player a variety of weapons based on the war and features various contemporary weapons and concepts, such as the AK47 assault rifle and punji stick traps. The game introduced several vehicle improvements over the prequel, such as air-lifting vehicles and working vehicle radios. The radios feature 1960s music and an option for the player to import their own audio files into a designated directory. Unlike the prequel, players are able to fire their weapons from vehicles when in the passenger seat of a vehicle. The game is the first in the &quot;Battlefield&quot; series to utilize a 3D map, allowing players to see icons that represent the position of control points or friendly units, giving the player increased situational awareness.

==Reception==
In June 2004, &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; received a &quot;Gold&quot; certification from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Overall sales of &quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; reached 990,000 copies by that November, by which time the &quot;Battlefield&quot; series had sold 4.4 million copies.

The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

&quot;Battlefield Vietnam&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;″s list of the 10 best computer games of 2004. It won the magazine&#x27;s special award for &quot;Best Soundtrack&quot;. It also won GameSpot&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Best Licensed Music&quot; award.

<doc id="561605" wikidata="Q3696349" url="?curid=561605" title="Gurbani">
<text>Gurbani (, pronunciation: , lit. the Guru&#x27;s words) is a Sikh term, very commonly used by Sikhs to refer to various compositions by the Sikh Gurus and other writers of Guru Granth Sahib. In general, hymns in the central text of the Sikhs, the Guru Granth Sahib, are called &quot;Gurbani&quot;. Among Amritdhari Sikhs, a few texts from Dasam Granth which are read as Nitnem, like &quot;Tav-Prasad Savaiye&quot; and &quot;Chaupai&quot;, are also considered &quot;Gurbani&quot;. In Adi Granth, Gurbani is a sound which comes directly from the Supreme and the text is a written form of the same in worldly language and scripts. It is also called &quot;Guru’s Bani&quot;. 

Prior to reading Gurbani or meditating, it is compulsory to cover the head with a turban, dupatta or other cloth, as well as removing shoes, performing at least the &quot;Panj Ishnan&quot; (washing of the 5 main parts of the body), and if possible using a teeth-cleaning twig. Gurbani are explanations of qualities of the Primal Lord and Soul which a Sikh should comprehend and with which they can attain the supreme state. Sikh historical writings, unauthentic writings or apocryphal compositions written under the names of Sikh Gurus and other writings by Sikhs are not considered Gurbani and are referred to as &quot;Kachi Bani&quot; (ਕੱਚੀ ਬਾਣੀ; meaning &quot;adulterated verses&quot;).

==Etymology==
Gurbani is composed of two words: &#x27;Gur&#x27; and &#x27;Bani&#x27;. Gur has multiple meanings depending on context. In Guru Granth Sahib, &quot;Gur&quot; is used for multiple meanings, as per context of hymn. The common use of &quot;Gur&quot; is either for wisdom and internal conscious mind (referred to as Chitta or Antar Atma).

Thereby Gurbani either means &quot;the speech of wisdom&quot; or &quot;the speech of conscious mind&quot;.

Gurbani is directly received from inside after attaining a Supreme state, whereas the Granth or textual form is worldly language of the same. Gurbani is also referred to as &quot;Dhur Ki Bani&quot; (ਧੁਰ ਕੀ ਬਾਣੀ; meaning &quot;the speech from the Supreme house&quot;). In the Adi Granth, it is considered a source of spiritual knowledge which illuminates the mind and gives internal bliss. The one who comprehends Gurbani is also described as an Amritdhari. Gurbani is a source of truth with which the internal filth and sins get eradicated and one who find Gurbani sweet is in supreme state.

Extracts from Guru Granth Sahib are called Gutkas (ਗੁਟਕਾ; meaning &quot;small books&quot;) containing sections of Gurbani. These Gutkas can vary from just a few pages to hundreds of pages and are used by the Sikhs to read these Banis on a daily basis.

== Compilation ==
Gurbani is not seen as mere intellectual, spiritual writings conjured by the Sikh gurus, bhagats, bhatts, and gursikhs, but rather as divine word revealed by the creator itself. As per Guru Arjan regarding the origin of gurbani:

==Nitnem compositions==
The hymns of the Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Tav-Prasad Savaiye, Chaupai Sahib and Anand Sahib should be read before sunrise daily according to the Sikh Rehat Maryada. These are recited by initiated Sikhs at Amritvela (before 6 a.m.). Rehras is read in the evening around sunset or after a day&#x27;s work and finally Kirtan Sohila is read before going to bed. Doing &quot;Nitnem&quot; is also commonly referred as doing &quot;paath&quot;.

Japji Sahib, Anand Sahib, and Kirtan Sohila are a part of Guru Granth Sahib. Jaap Sahib, Tav-Prasad Savaiye, and Chaupai Sahib were all compiled by Guru Gobind Singh and found in the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;. Rehras is a mix with hymns from both Guru Granth Sahib and Dasam Granth. A Sikh may add more &quot;Gurbani&quot; to their Nitnem and if done frequently that &quot;Gurbani&quot; becomes a part of their &quot;Nitnem&quot;.

In 1941, SOA was renamed the New York State Agricultural and Technical Institute (ATI). ATI became a member college of the State University of New York in 1948. To recognize advanced technology programs added in the 1950s and 1960s, the college underwent another name change in 1965, this time becoming the State University of New York Agricultural and Technical College at Canton (ATC). In 1987, the SUNY Board of Trustees authorized yet another name change to the college&#x27;s present designation as the State University of New York College of Technology at Canton.

In 1997, SUNY Canton received bachelor&#x27;s degree granting approval from the SUNY Board of Trustees and the Governor of New York State.

<doc id="561611" wikidata="Q7970178" url="?curid=561611" title="Warren Entsch">
<text>Warren George Entsch (born 31 May 1950) is an Australian politician who has been a member of the House of Representatives from 1996 to 2007 and since 2010, representing the Division of Leichhardt. He is a member of the Liberal National Party of Queensland, and sits with the Liberal Party in federal parliament.

==Early life==
Entsch was born in Babinda, Queensland and served in the Royal Australian Air Force 1969–78. He was a railway porter, maintenance fitter and welder, real estate agent, farmer, grazier, crocodile catcher and company director before entering politics.

In his time outside of Parliament between 2007 and 2010, Entsch worked as an independent director on the board of CEC Group, a Cairns-based property development company, and a Director of the Australian Rainforest Foundation, a Cairns-based organisation focussing on the Daintree Rainforest.

==Politics==
Entsch was first elected to the House of Representatives at the March 1996 federal election. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources 1998–2001 and was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources from 2001 to 2006. He then decided on retirement, ostensibly to spend time with his teenage son, and did not contest the November 2007 election. He remained a member of the Liberal Party of Queensland until the formation of the Liberal National Party of Queensland in 2008. At that time, he supported the leadership of Brendan Nelson, regarding the spill against him by Malcolm Turnbull as &quot;treachery.&quot;

On 10 November 2009, Entsch announced that he would again run for pre-selection for the seat of Leichhardt and was re-elected to parliament at the August 2010 election defeating the man who had succeeded him in 2007, Labor incumbent Jim Turnour. Entsch was subsequently appointed Chief Opposition Whip by then-opposition leader Tony Abbott.

At the 2016 federal election Entsch was re-elected with 39.4% of first-preference votes marking his seventh election victory in 20 years. Entsch played a part in deposing of Malcolm Turnbull in the 2018 Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills. He was again re-elected at the 2019 Australian federal election with 37.6% of first-preference votes. He was shortly afterwards appointed to the position of &quot;special envoy to the Great Barrier Reef&quot; by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

In May 2019, in his re-election victory speech, claimed his own success in the legalisation of same-sex marriage: &quot;I&#x27;ve been very successful in campaigning for national change. Medical cannabis was one that I was able to successfully implement, the other was same-sex marriage, which I&#x27;m very proud of.&quot;

In his role as Chair of the Parliament&#x27;s Northern Australia Committee and the Juukan Gorge Inquiry, Entsch tabled the interim report of the &quot;Inquiry into the destruction of 46,000-year-old caves at the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia&quot; in December 2020.

Entsch was able to retain his seat at the 2022 election. He argued for the &quot;No&quot; case in the 2023 referendum on the Voice to Parliament. In local matters, Entsch has proposed the sale of housing commission properties to tenants, the same mechanism by which his own parents had become home owners. Enstch has become a supporter of a spaceport on the Cape York Peninsula proposed by Space Centre Australia, where “I started as a sceptic and I’m now an absolute disciple.&quot;

==Political positions==
Entsch is a member of the Moderate faction of the Liberal Party. He is known for supporting progressive causes.

=== Cannabis reform ===

Access to medical cannabis was a long campaign for Entsch. In February of 2016 he was one of the politicians who succeeded in passing a reform bill approved for conditions ranging from chronic pain to anxiety and depression.

===Indigenous Voice to Parliament===
While Entsch did not campaign for or against the Indigenous Voice to Parliament, in the eventually-unsuccessful referendum on the matter in 2023, Entsch voted No. His reasoning was that he believed it would not have provided adequate support for Indigenous people and their communities. He does, however, support the constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. He also criticised prominent Yes campaigner Noel Pearson, who he called a &quot;crony&quot; and rejected his large influence in local politics on the Cape York Peninsula. 65.55% of voters in Entsch&#x27;s seat of Leichhardt voted No in the referendum.

=== Maritime environment ===
Entsch has strongly prosecuted the issue of plastic pollution on the reef, asserting that climate change was not a threat to the existence of the Great Barrier Reef. By the end of 2019 Entsch acknowledged climate change and its impact as a serious threat to the Great Barrier Reef. In his December 2019 report to environment minister Sussan Ley he stated &quot;Global climate change looms as the most serious existential threat to the long-term health and viability of the Reef.&quot;

=== Same sex marriage ===

During the lead-up to Australia legalising same-sex marriage in 2017, Entsch was for a long time a strong advocate for marriage equality in the Coalition.

In December 2005, Entsch pledged support for a civil union scheme after Britain began granting civil partnerships. In September 2010 Entsch indicated that he did not consider same-sex marriage an important issue and voted against the Australian Greens&#x27; 2010 motion for members of the house to poll their constituents on the issue of same-sex marriage. Two years later, following opposition leader Tony Abbott&#x27;s refusal to grant a conscience vote to Liberal MPs, he voted against a bill sponsored by Labor MP Stephen Jones that would have legalised same-sex marriage. On 17 August 2015, against Abbott&#x27;s wishes, Entsch introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to legalise same-sex marriage, arguing it would prevent Australia from being &quot;a divided nation.&quot; On 7 December 2017, Entsch spoke in favour of and voted for, the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Bill that enabled same-sex marriage in Australia.

== Personal life ==
Entsch is married to Yolonde.In March 2023, she was named by Queensland opposition leader David Crisafulli to be the LNP&#x27;s candidate for the electoral district of Cairns in the 2024 Queensland state election.

<doc id="561615" wikidata="Q7947645" url="?curid=561615" title="WCCB">
<text>WCCB (channel 18) is a television station in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States, affiliated with The CW. It serves as the flagship station of locally based Bahakel Communications. WCCB&#x27;s studios are located just outside Uptown Charlotte, off Independence Boulevard (across from Bojangles&#x27; Coliseum), and its transmitter is located in Newell, an unincorporated area of Mecklenburg County just northeast of the Charlotte city limits.

==History==

===Beginnings===
WCCB traces its roots to WAYS-TV, which signed on the air on January 5, 1954, as Charlotte&#x27;s second television station. It was a primary ABC affiliate with a secondary NBC affiliation. Broadcasting on UHF channel 36, it was North Carolina&#x27;s second UHF station (after WNAO-TV in Raleigh). It was owned by George Dowdy and his company, Inter-City Advertising, owners of WAYS radio (610 AM, now WFNZ); Inter-City had filed for channel 11 prior to the 1948 TV freeze, amended its application to specify channel 9 in 1952, then sought channel 36 instead to avoid a comparative hearing. Hugh Deadwyler became co-owner of the station later that year and acquired the station outright after buying Inter-City&#x27;s interest in 1955; it sold for $4 and the assumption of liabilities. With the sale, WAYS-TV became WQMC.

Channel 36 had a very weak 132,000-watt signal which was spotty further than from the transmitter, making it virtually unviewable even in some parts of Mecklenburg County. Even then, like most UHF stations, it was only viewable on most sets with an expensive UHF converter, and picture quality was marginal at best. Television set manufacturers were not required to include UHF tuners at the time; this would not change until Congress passed the All-Channel Receiver Act in 1964. As a result, it made almost no headway against CBS affiliate WBTV (channel 3), which continued to cherry-pick certain NBC programs.

The station went dark on March 15, 1955, in what was intended to be a temporary hiatus while it underwent technical improvements, including the construction of a more powerful transmitter at a new location. However, Deadwyler was unable to get the station back on track. In March 1956, Inter-City Advertising sued to place channel 36 into receivership. Inter-City claimed that Deadwyler had not paid any of the $86,220 debt to Radio Corporation of America that was transferred to him and for which RCA was seeking payment from Inter-City.

===WUTV===
Deadwyler organized Century Advertising Co., Inc., which planned to relaunch channel 36 in 1957 as ABC affiliate WUTV, with a more powerful signal than its predecessor. However, these plans were derailed when Charlotte&#x27;s second VHF station, WSOC-TV (channel 9), signed on the air that April as an NBC affiliate. Even with the stronger signal, WUTV would have still been all but unviewable in most of the market. In addition, most of the market (particularly the western portion) got a fairly decent signal from WLOS-TV out of Asheville; which was included in the Charlotte television listings for many years and even ran ads for its programs in Charlotte area newspapers.

After four years of delays, Century Advertising relaunched WUTV on September 5, 1961. The station broadcast non-commercial educational programming from the University of North Carolina and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, though it retained a commercial license. A full new facility was constructed behind the Charlotte Coliseum at 1 Television Place—still home to WCCB today—including a new transmitter site. WUTV&#x27;s effective radiated power was 206kW visual. In the meantime, Century pursued the allocation of VHF channel 6 to Charlotte.

WUTV, however, was not capable of live programming. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Board began to pursue the construction of a full educational TV station on reserved channel 42, buying the equipment of a failed station in Fort Pierce, Florida. While channel 36 might have remained on air until the school board was ready to launch WTVI, Century Advertising decided to ask the educational groups to pay rent in early 1963 after having initially verbally agreed to a three-year rent-free contract. They opted to pay to finish out the 1962–1963 school year but no further, causing WUTV to go silent on May 16, 1963.

===Relaunch===
In June 1964, businessman Cy Bahakel—who moved from Roanoke, Virginia, to Charlotte—bought the dormant channel 36 license and facilities from Century for $175,000. An addition would be made to the studio building as part of Bahakel&#x27;s efforts to return the station to the air.

Bahakel returned the station to air on November 1 of that year as WCCB-TV (for &quot;Charlotte Cy Bahakel&quot;). The call letters had recently been used by what is now WNCF in Montgomery, Alabama, which was acquired by Bahakel earlier that year. Logically, it should have returned as a full-time ABC affiliate. Charlotte had only two network-affiliated stations, CBS affiliate WBTV and NBC affiliate WSOC-TV. On paper, Charlotte had been large enough to support three full network affiliates since the 1950s. However, WCCB&#x27;s signal, like its predecessor, was nowhere near adequate for a market that stretched from the Sandhills in the east to the High Country in the west. Its signal only operated at 200,000 watts, essentially limiting its coverage area to Charlotte proper and its inner suburbs. Additionally, the FCC had only begun requiring television sets to have all-channel tuning a few months before, and most Charlotte households did not yet have UHF-capable sets. Under the circumstances, ABC decided to retain its secondary affiliation agreements with WBTV and WSOC. WCCB was forced to settle for a secondary affiliation with all three networks, airing most of the network shows that WBTV and WSOC chose to turn down. As of March 1965, the nine-county area had 42,887 homes with UHF, with the number increasing by 3,000 per month. Bahakel said this &quot;exceeds our expectation&quot;. For the next three years, WCCB split most of NBC and ABC&#x27;s programming roughly equally with WSOC. It also picked up some CBS shows from WBTV, which still cleared a few ABC shows.

On November 1, 1966, WCCB moved from channel 36 to channel 18, broadcasting from a new tower located on Newell Hickory Grove Road in northeast Charlotte. The new channel 18 facility was capable of 1.35 million watts of power, giving WCCB a coverage area comparable to those of WBTV and WSOC-TV. In 1967, WSOC-TV dropped all ABC programming and became a full-time NBC affiliate, leaving WCCB-TV to be the exclusive ABC affiliate. It took Charlotte 18 years to finally gain full service from all three major networks of the time. The state&#x27;s largest market thus got a full-fledged ABC affiliate after the state&#x27;s two smallest markets, Greenville–New Bern–Washington and Wilmington, received ABC affiliates of their own (WCTI-TV and WWAY respectively). However, despite the stronger signal and the first consistent airing of all network programs in Charlotte TV history, WCCB-TV remained a distant third in the ratings.

In 1977, ABC announced that it had lured away WSOC-TV to be its new outlet in the Charlotte market beginning July 1, 1978, replacing WCCB. That decision set off a two-station showdown between WCCB and nine-year-old independent WRET-TV (channel 36, now WCNC-TV) for the NBC affiliation in Charlotte. WCCB was initially seen as the favorite. Unlike WRET, it had a news department. Sources at NBC were said to see channel 36 as their last option, behind WCCB, with its stronger signal, and long-dominant WBTV, which the network was trying to woo from CBS to no avail.

However, WRET owner Ted Turner promised NBC officials that he would spend $2.5 million on station improvements if the network affiliated with channel 36. Of that total, $1 million would go toward starting a news department within one year. The proposed news department would employ 22 people, almost double the size of WCCB&#x27;s 12-person news operation and almost as large as WSOC&#x27;s 22-person department. On April 29, news broke that WRET-TV had been selected for the NBC affiliation, with the network preferring it to WCCB based on Turner&#x27;s record of turning around the station and his ownership of the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks.

With the decision, WCCB became an independent station. It bought a large chunk of syndicated programming from WRET, including cartoons and older sitcoms. For a time in the late 1970s and early 1980s, after-school cartoons (&quot;Afternoon Express&quot;) were hosted by the costumed Sonic Man space alien character, played by Larry Sprinkle, who has been a staple in Charlotte radio and television, including serving as a weather anchor for channel 36 since the 1980s. WCCB carried on for almost a decade as a typical UHF general entertainment independent station.

=== Fox affiliation ===

In 1986, WCCB became the last station in a top-50 market to join Fox as one of the upstart network&#x27;s charter affiliates, since it was doing so well in the ratings as an independent. WCCB affiliated with the network when it launched on October 6 of that year. For most of the next quarter-century, WCCB was one of the strongest Fox stations in the country – even claiming to be the highest-rated Fox affiliate in the nation during the 2008–09 television season. The station reaped a major windfall after the NFL moved its National Football Conference television package from CBS to Fox in 1994. By coincidence, this made WCCB the unofficial &quot;home&quot; station of the Carolina Panthers upon the team&#x27;s 1995 inception. WCCB carried most Panthers regular season games during the team&#x27;s first 18 seasons, and later acquired the local rights to the team&#x27;s preseason games from WBTV. Panthers games had generally been the most-watched programs in the market during the NFL football season. After having branded itself as &quot;TV18&quot; since sign-on, WCCB changed its branding to &quot;Fox 18&quot; in 1988 and then to &quot;Fox Charlotte&quot; in 2002.
Cy Bahakel was an original partner in the NBA&#x27;s Charlotte Hornets, and WCCB served as the team&#x27;s flagship station for the Hornets&#x27; first four seasons in Charlotte from 1988 to 1992. Bahakel owned WCCB until his death on April 20, 2006, with his family taking over the duties of running the station (and its parent company, Bahakel Communications) since that point. In 2007, WCCB&#x27;s website switched to Fox Interactive Media&#x27;s &quot;MyFox&quot; platform (which was originally intended for Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations), with the domain transitioning from foxcharlotte.tv to myfoxcharlotte.com; however, the station de-emphasized the &quot;MyFox&quot; corporate reference within a year, with the URL becoming known simply as foxcharlotte.com. The revamped page continued to use the &quot;MyFox&quot; webpage template (sans the &quot;MyFox&quot; branding) until 2010, when Broadcast Interactive Media became WCCB&#x27;s site host.

===Loss of Fox affiliation and switch to The CW===
On January 28, 2013, Fox Television Stations announced the purchase of CW affiliate WJZY (channel 46) and MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYT-TV (channel 55) from Capitol Broadcasting Company for $18 million. While WCCB had been one of the network&#x27;s strongest affiliates, Fox had been looking to buy a station in what had become the 25th-largest market. It also wanted to own as many stations in NFC markets as possible; at the time Charlotte was the only NFC market in the Eastern Time Zone where the Fox station was only an affiliate. Another likely factor in the purchase was an option by Fox to purchase the Raleigh–Durham CW/MyNetworkTV duopoly of WLFL and WRDC from Sinclair Broadcast Group, which would have resulted in WRAZ (a sister station to WJZY and WMYT at the time) losing its Fox affiliation.
On April 18, one day after Fox completed its purchase of WJZY and WMYT, WCCB announced that it would replace WJZY as Charlotte&#x27;s CW affiliate on July 1. On May 9, it was reported that Bahakel reserved the domain &quot;CharlottesCW.com&quot; for two years. Given the station&#x27;s strong performance as a Fox affiliate and its half-century of service to the area (in its current incarnation), WCCB was expected to become one of the ten strongest CW affiliates in the nation when it formally joined that network. The old &quot;Fox Charlotte&quot; logo remained at the entrance to the station&#x27;s studios until mid-May when it was replaced with signage bearing the &quot;Charlotte CW&quot; logo.

WCCB&#x27;s relationship with Fox formally ended after 27 years on June 30, with &quot;American Dad!&quot; being the final Fox program to air on the station. With the loss of WCCB&#x27;s Fox affiliation, WCCB formally rolled out its new on-air branding and logo the next afternoon, July 1, 2013, its first day as a CW affiliate. However, most verbal references to the station are to its call letters, with any CW references used obliquely (in the manner of &quot;WCCB, Charlotte&#x27;s CW&quot;). It marked the first time in a quarter-century that the station has used its call letters on a permanent basis in its branding.

==Programming==
WCCB was Charlotte&#x27;s home of first-run episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; from its December 1989 debut as a Christmas special until the station&#x27;s Fox disaffiliation in 2013. WCCB was also one of the few stations broadcasting &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; that was affiliated with Fox, with others including WLFL, Fox&#x27;s Raleigh–Durham affiliate from 1986 to 1998 and Fox&#x27;s New York City flagship station WNYW.
WCCB remained home to Panthers preseason football games until losing them to WSOC-TV for the 2019 season. It also began airing Charlotte 49ers college football games in September 2013, with WCCB carrying any 49er home games not carried by Conference USA&#x27;s national and regional television partners.

===News operation===
WCCB presently broadcasts 30 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, hours on Saturdays and one hour on Sundays); in addition, the station produces &quot;WCCB News Got Game&quot;, a half-hour sports highlight program that airs on Sunday evenings following the 10 p.m. newscast. WCCB&#x27;s studio facilities served as a production facility for WOLO-TV&#x27;s newscasts from 2002 to 2005 in one of the first instances of centralcasting; studio segments for WOLO&#x27;s newscasts returned to Columbia afterward.

WCCB aired newscasts at various times between 1964 until its ABC disaffiliation in 1978. It reduced its news department to a skeleton staff after becoming an independent station and did not carry a regularly scheduled newscast again until 1994, when it began airing a nightly 10 p.m. news program produced by WSOC-TV. In 1999, WCCB announced plans to launch its own news department. That summer, WSOC-TV relocated its prime time newscast to its sister independent station WAXN-TV (channel 64). WCNC then temporarily took over production of the late-evening newscast on WCCB until the launch of the station&#x27;s in-house news department on January 1, 2000, with the debut of a half-hour 10 p.m. newscast. Ironically, the WCNC-produced newscast on WCCB drew a larger audience at the time than the newscasts that actually aired on WCNC.

On September 28, 2008, beginning with the 10 p.m. newscast, WCCB became the second television station in the Charlotte market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The upgrade included the debut of a brand new HD-ready news set. On February 4, 2013, Ken White, who had served as WCCB&#x27;s news director since the 2000 inception of its current news department, was reassigned to sister station WBBJ-TV in Jackson, Tennessee, as its interim news director; assistant news director Angela Robbins was appointed as White&#x27;s replacement at WCCB.

After WCCB became a CW affiliate on July 1, 2013, it retained its weekday morning and nightly prime time newscasts. On November 9, 2013, WCCB debuted half-hour 6 p.m. newscasts on Saturday and Sunday evenings, making it one of the few television stations to have carried an early evening newscast on weekends without an existing newscast in that daypart on weekdays. (WCCB handles master control responsibilities for WOLO&#x27;s weeknight 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts.)

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
Previously, a standard-definition simulcast of the station&#x27;s main channel was carried on its second digital subchannel; this simulcast feed was later upgraded to high-definition with the addition of SAP and DVS audio channels. In June 2012, the SAP/DVS feed was added to the main channel as well. The second subchannel was removed in December 2013, as well as the SAP/DVS feed from the main channel which was unused at that time by The CW (it has since returned due to FCC description and weather warning read-out requirements, along with it being utilized by The CW for &quot;One Magnificent Morning&quot; and a Spanish dub of &quot;Jane the Virgin&quot;); digital subchannel 18.2 would return in April 2014 carrying QVC&#x27;s &quot;Over the Air&quot; simulcast service. On July 21, 2014, it was announced that Antenna TV would be added to the second subchannel on August 15, 2014, bringing it back to the Charlotte market after being dropped by its previous affiliate WJZY. Antenna TV began airing that day, replacing QVC Over the Air, which went to a new fourth digital subchannel. On August 29, 2019, the Home Shopping Network was added on 18.7; this was followed by Dabl, which premiered on September 9 on 18.6. On January 8, 2020, Cozi TV was added to 18.8. On October 27, 2020, Antenna TV (18.2) and Start TV (18.5) swapped subchannels.

Until March 1, 2011, WCCB carried a feed of its weather radar on its third subchannel, which provided NOAA Weather Radio feeds from Spencer Mountain, North Carolina, and Columbia and Rock Hill, South Carolina, through SAP. On that date, MeTV replaced the weather radar feed after having the start date of its affiliation delayed for a month due to contractual issues. The weather radar feed remained available through WCCB&#x27;s mobile DTV service, but this has since been discontinued. The Spencer Mountain and Rock Hill NOAA feeds were initially retained on MeTV through SAP. The Spencer Mountain feed was removed in mid-2012, and the Rock Hill feed was removed in December 2013.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WCCB shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 18, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 27, using virtual channel 18. On February 4, 2010, WCCB signed on a translator located near Connelly Springs on UHF channel 20, W20DD-D. The translator was licensed to Marion as W08BJ. It was purchased from WSPA-TV and moved to Smith Mountain.

==Out-of-market cable carriage==
In recent years, WCCB has been carried on cable in several areas outside the Charlotte television market, including on cable systems within the Asheville and Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point markets, the Columbia, South Carolina market, and the Tri-Cities market in Tennessee and Virginia.

<text>Exit... Stage Left is the second live album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released as a double album in October 1981 by Anthem Records. After touring in support of their eighth studio album &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; (1981), the band gathered recordings made over the previous two years and constructed a live release from them with producer Terry Brown. The album features recordings from June 1980 on their &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; (1980) tour, and from 1981 on their &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; tour.

The album received a mostly positive reception from music critics and reached number 6 in the United Kingdom, 7 in Canada, and 10 in the United States. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling one million copies in the latter country. A same-titled home video was released in 1982 that documents the band on the &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; tour. &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot; was voted the ninth best live album of all time by &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine in 2004.

== Recording and production ==
Side two of &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot; was recorded from June 10–11, 1980 at The Apollo in Glasgow, Scotland, during the band&#x27;s tour for their seventh studio album, &quot;Permanent Waves&quot;. The remaining three sides were recorded during the subsequent tour of their eighth album, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;.

After the 1981 tour, the band retreated to Le Studio in Morin Heights in Quebec, Canada to edit and mix the recordings they had made on the two tours, which Neil Peart noted totalled over 50 reels of two-inch tape. The band went through the material to find the best performances for inclusion for a live album. Whenever they found a technical fault or a wrong note affecting an otherwise acceptable performance, they replaced it using material from other shows in their collection of tapes. In 1993, Geddy Lee revealed that the band had to add in new sections in the studio to correct passages with out-of-tune guitars. None of the individual band members is credited with the album&#x27;s production; the duty fell to their longtime producer, Terry Brown. During the production, Rush wrote and recorded &quot;Subdivisions&quot;, a new song that would be released on their following studio album, &quot;Signals&quot;.

Upon the album&#x27;s completion, Peart said the group were happier with &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot; than with their first live album &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot;, noting that the latter suffered from uneven sound quality. In subsequent years however, Lee developed a more critical view of &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot;, noting that the group tried to make it sound &quot;too perfect&quot; in part by reducing the levels of audience noise, while Alex Lifeson for his part thought the album sounded too clean and not as raw as &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot;, and as a consequence the band aimed to reach a &quot;middle ground&quot; between the two with &quot;A Show of Hands&quot;, Rush&#x27;s third live release. Nevertheless, the album remains a fan favorite.

Rush performs a short rendition of &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; before &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;. &quot;Broon&#x27;s Bane&quot; is a short classical guitar arrangement performed by Lifeson as an extended intro to &quot;The Trees.&quot; The song is named after Terry Brown, nicknamed &quot;Broon&quot; by the band. The song is not featured on any other live or studio recording by Rush. Also on the album, Lee refers to Brown as &quot;T.C. Broonsie&quot; when introducing &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;.

The original CD issue removed &quot;A Passage to Bangkok&quot;, as CDs could only hold 75 minutes at the time. It was included on the 1997 remaster, as CD capacity had increased to 80 minutes by that time. Before the remastered version was released, the same live version of &quot;A Passage to Bangkok&quot; was released on the compilation &quot;Chronicles&quot; in 1990.

The second verse of &quot;Beneath, Between, &amp; Behind&quot; is omitted. On &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot;, the introductory classical guitar solo from the original recording is played on electric guitar and doubled in length, Lee sings part of a nursery rhyme in Yiddish during the &quot;Danforth and Pape&quot; section (the liner notes include a translation of his words), and a short bass and percussion solo is added before the &quot;Monsters! (Reprise)&quot; section.

== Title ==
The title comes from the catchphrase of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon character Snagglepuss. The term &quot;stage left&quot; is a stage direction used in blocking to identify the left side of a theater from the point of view of the performer, as opposed to the point of view of the audience.

== Artwork ==
An item from each of Rush&#x27;s previous eight studio album covers can be seen on the front and back cover of this live album, though each has been modified in some way. The snowy owl from &quot;Fly by Night&quot; flies above &quot;Apollo&quot;, the man in the suit from &quot;Hemispheres&quot;, who stands next to Paula Turnbull, the woman from &quot;Permanent Waves&quot;. On the back cover, the puppet king from &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; sits atop a box stenciled with the band logo from &quot;Rush&quot;. Next to him is a painting of the &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; album cover, held by one of the movers from &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, with another mover standing behind. Next to this is &quot;Dionysus&quot;, the nude man from &quot;Hemispheres&quot;. Behind this scene, the starman from &quot;2112&quot; hangs in the background, next to an &quot;EXIT&quot; sign. The scene was shot in Toronto&#x27;s then-abandoned Winter Garden Theatre.

Rush&#x27;s first live album, &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot;, is also represented by the cover&#x27;s background image, taken at a concert at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium in Buffalo, New York. Both album covers show Rush&#x27;s live setup on an empty stage, although the band no longer used the white carpet by the time of &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot;″s release.

== Reissues ==
A limited-edition promotional 6-track vinyl sampler: Rush &#x27;N&#x27; Roulette, included excerpts of six tracks from &quot;Exit...Stage Left&quot;. The promotional album used a unique mastering process in which concentric grooves were inscribed so that different material would be played depending on where the stylus was put down on the record&#x27;s surface.
&quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot; was re-released on CD in 1997 as part of the &quot;Rush Remasters&quot; series.
* The tray has a picture of three fingerprints, light blue, pink, and lime green (left to right, mirroring the cover art of &quot;Retrospective II&quot;) with &quot;The Rush Remasters&quot; printed in all capital letters just to the left. All remasters from &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; through &quot;A Show of Hands&quot; are like this.
* Includes the track &quot;A Passage to Bangkok&quot; which was left off the original CD issue due to time constraints.
* On some copies, each of the band members&#x27; photos are reversed from the original. This error has since been corrected on post-1997 reissues of &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot;.

&quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot; was remastered again in 2011 by Andy VanDette for the &quot;Sector&quot; box sets, which re-released all of Rush&#x27;s Mercury-era albums. It is included in the &quot;Sector 2&quot; set.

&quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot; was remastered for vinyl in 2015 by Sean Magee at Abbey Road Studios as a part of the official &quot;12 Months of Rush&quot; promotion. The high definition master prepared for this release was also made available for purchase in a 24-bit/48 kHz digital format at several high-resolution audio online music stores. These remasters have significantly less dynamic range compression than the 1997 remasters and the &quot;Sector&quot; remasters by Andy VanDette. Sean Magee remastered the audio from an analog copy of the original digital master, using a 192 kHz sample rate. But since &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot; was originally mixed on digital equipment at 16-bit/44.1 kHz, no audio above 22 kHz exists in the original digital master or any of the remasters, which is why many digital music stores are only selling the album at a maximum sample rate of 48 kHz.

<doc id="561623" wikidata="Q2299883" url="?curid=561623" title="When Doves Cry">
<text>&quot;When Doves Cry&quot; is a song by American musician Prince, and the lead single from his sixth studio album &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. According to the DVD commentary of the film &quot;Purple Rain&quot; (1984), Prince was asked by director Albert Magnoli to write a song to match the theme of a particular segment of the film that involved Prince&#x27;s character The Kid&#x27;s intermingled parental difficulties with his father Francis L. (Clarence Williams III) and mother (Olga Karlatos) and a love affair with Apollonia (Apollonia Kotero). The next morning, Prince had composed two songs, one of which was &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;. According to Prince&#x27;s biographer Per Nilsen, the song was inspired by his relationship with Vanity 6 member Susan Moonsie.

&quot;When Doves Cry&quot; was Prince&#x27;s first &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 No. 1 single, staying there for five weeks, and was also a worldwide hit. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, it was the top-selling single of 1984. It is certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was the last single released by a solo artist to receive a Platinum certification before the certification requirements were lowered in 1989. &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; was ranked number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1984. Following Prince&#x27;s death in 2016, the song re-charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at number eight, its first appearance in the top 10 since the week ending September 1, 1984.

The music video, directed by Prince, premiered on MTV in June 1984. It opens with white doves emerging from double doors to reveal Prince in a bathtub, then shows him performing the song in various scenes. The video sparked controversy among network executives, who thought that its sexual nature was too explicit for television. &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; is ranked number 37 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and is included in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

== Background and composition ==
Prince wrote and composed &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; after all the other tracks were complete on &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. In addition to providing vocals, he played all instruments on the track. The song&#x27;s texture is remarkably stark. There is no bass line, which is very unusual for an &#x27;80s dance song; Prince said that there originally was a bass line but, after a conversation with singer Jill Jones, he decided that the song was too conventional with it included. The song features a guitar solo intro and a Linn LM-1 drum machine, followed by a looped guttural vocal. After the lyrics, there is another, much longer, guitar and synthesizer solo. The song ends on a classical music-inspired keyboard piece backed by another synthesizer solo. Keyboardist Matt Fink revealed in 2014 that the baroque synthesizer solo was recorded by Prince at half speed and an octave lower against a half-speed backing track, then sped up to create the final version. Fink was then tasked to learn and perform the solo at the album&#x27;s speed.

On versions edited for radio, either the song fades out as the long guitar and synthesizer solo begins, or the solo is eliminated altogether and the song skips to the ending with Prince&#x27;s harmonizing and classical finish.

During live performances of the song on the Purple Rain Tour, Prince&#x27;s bass player Brown Mark added bass lines to the song as well as to other songs without bass lines.

The song is in the key of A minor.

==Reception==
In its contemporary review of the song, &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;featuring ethereal lyrics, a pounding backbeat and a sometimes ominous musical atmosphere, this single again proves Prince to be one of the most provocative and sophisticated artists in the business.&quot;

&quot;When Doves Cry&quot; was No. 1 in the US for five weeks, from July 7, 1984, to August 4, 1984, keeping Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; from reaching the top spot. Because of tabulation differences, the song was announced as the year&#x27;s No. 2 single on the &quot;American Top 40&quot; year-end countdown (with Paul McCartney featuring Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Say Say Say&quot; at No. 1). The song was voted as the best single of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the No. 1 year-end single of 1984. In 2016, after Prince&#x27;s death, &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at No. 20, peaking at No. 8. It also ranked No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Black Singles chart for eight weeks (from June 30, to August 18, 1984), preventing Tina Turner&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do With It&quot; from reaching the top spot for five of those weeks.

The B-side was the cult fan favorite &quot;17 Days&quot;, which was originally intended for Apollonia 6&#x27;s self-titled album. A 12-inch single issued in the UK included &quot;17 Days&quot; and two tracks from Prince&#x27;s previous album, &quot;1999:&quot; its title track and &quot;D.M.S.R.&quot;. The entire title of &quot;17 Days (the rain will come down, then U will have 2 choose, if U believe, look 2 the dawn and U shall never lose)&quot; is now the longest-titled flip side of a Hot 100 No. 1, with 85 letters and/or numbers.

&quot;When Doves Cry&quot; became one of Prince&#x27;s signature songs. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine ranked &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; the No. 6 song of all time.
 In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; No. 37 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2006, VH1&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;80s&quot; ranked the song at No. 5. On October 13, 2008, the song was voted No. 2 on Australian VH1&#x27;s Top 10 Number One Pop Songs countdown. The &quot;80 of the 80s&quot; podcast ranks it as the No. 59 song of the decade. In 2016, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the song number three on their list of the 50 greatest Prince songs, and in 2022, &quot;American Songwriter&quot; ranked the song number two on their list of the 10 greatest Prince songs.

&quot;When Doves Cry&quot; was sampled for use in MC Hammer&#x27;s 1990 hit song, &quot;Pray&quot; from his album &quot;Please Hammer Don&#x27;t Hurt &#x27;Em&quot;, one of the few samples of his songs legally sanctioned by Prince.

==Music video==
The music video (directed by Prince himself) was released on MTV in June 1984. It opens with white doves emerging from double doors to reveal Prince in a bathtub. It also includes scenes from the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; film interspersed with shots of The Revolution performing and dancing in a white room. The final portion of the video incorporates a mirrored frame of the left half of the picture, creating a doubling effect. The video was nominated for Best Choreography at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards. The video sparked controversy among network executives, who thought that its sexual nature was too explicit for television.

<doc id="561626" wikidata="Q2983622" url="?curid=561626" title="Marianopolis College">
<text>Marianopolis College is a private English-language college in the Canadian province of Quebec. Located in Westmount, Quebec, it is an anglophone college with a student body over 2,000. The General and Vocational Education College, known as a CEGEP, is affiliated with the Association des collèges privés du Québec (ACPQ), Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC) and Canadian Colleges Athletic Association (CCAA).

==Campus==
The college&#x27;s current site is at 4873 Westmount Ave in Westmount, between Vendôme and Villa-Maria metro stations.

Prior to April 2007, it was situated at 3880 Côte-des-Neiges.

==Programs==
The college offers pre-university programs, which take two years to complete and cover the subject matters which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada and introductory first-year university curriculum in preparation for a chosen field in university. Accordingly, graduates may, in certain circumstances, receive advance credit of up to one full year in some disciplines when enrolling in universities outside the province of Quebec.

While the college primarily offers two-year pre-university programs leading to a Diploma of Collegial Studies (DEC), several three-year double-DEC programs are also available. These programs allow students to combine music with Science, Social Science or Arts.

==History==
The school inception can be traced back to Marguerite Bourgeoys, the founder of the Notre-Dame Congregation and founder of the first school in New France in 1658.
The school was founded in 1908 as the bilingual Notre Dame Ladies College, the first institution of higher learning for English-speaking Catholic women in Quebec. Initially, it offered degrees through Université Laval, the first being offered three years after the college&#x27;s founding. The degree-granting agreement was later transferred to Université de Montréal. In 1926, the school was renamed Marguerite Bourgeoys College.

During the World War II era, the English sector of the college was reorganized to be in line with anglophone universities, including programs in general science and honours chemistry. It changed its name to Marianopolis College (from Greek City of Maria) (since the teaching congregation has another much older nearby secondary school named Villa Maria [1854]).

In 1967, several institutions were merged and became public ones, when the Quebec system of colleges was created. Changes to the education system in Quebec caused Marianopolis to adopt a college-level program in 1969. The college also began accepting male students during this time. The university degree-granting program was eventually phased out in 1972.

For 30 years, Marianopolis was located near McGill University at 3647 rue Peel, where it had moved in 1945 from a previous building that was destroyed by fire. In 1975, the college relocated to a larger campus on the site of the former Sulpician school Séminaire de Philosophie, at 3880 Côte des Neiges. In 2007, Marianopolis returned to its original campus in the prestigious historic building at 4873 Westmount Av., designed by J.O. Marchand, a prominent Quebec architect of his time and creator of such architecturally significant buildings as the old Municipal Courthouse and the Peace Tower of the Parliament of Canada. The building was built first for the Institut pédagogique, a superior normal school to train female teachers and after as the mother house of the Congregation before returning to academic use. The campus’ facilities were modernized and a double gymnasium was built underground. In 2017, the College undertook the largest renovation project in its history to equip its near-century-old building with modern safety features, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning, while upgrading teaching, learning and working spaces across campus.

Although the college remains under the authority of the Congregation of Notre-Dame, students of all faiths are admitted and the curriculum and school experience are entirely secular.

==Campus life and environment==

===Congress and clubs===
The student life at Marianopolis is supported by MSU (Marianopolis Student Union) Congress, the student government. Congress consists of a President and a Vice-President of Administrative Affairs, as well as a Vice-President of Finance and ten other coordinators, each one focusing on a specific domain. The President, Vice-President and six other members of Congress are elected by the student body at Marianopolis College; the remaining five positions are appointed. Many major events and activities regarding the ensemble of the students are organized by Congress, such events include Halloween celebrations, health week, Valentine&#x27;s Day activities, and so forth.

Students may freely create their own club to practice hobbies with other fellow students or to simply attract people of similar interests together. Currently, there are approximately 100 clubs within the college ranging from dance clubs to Computer science club to Tea club. These clubs coordinate activities and meetings between members and some also benefit from Congress&#x27; monetary financing.

===Athletics===
The Marianopolis College athletes go by the name of the Demons. They are involved in multiple competitive sports such as volleyball, basketball, and rugby. These teams play within the RSEQ sports league.

Some student clubs also practice various other sports such as rowing, dragon boat, skiing, and tennis.

The fitness center and gymnasium are open to students during certain hours during the week for them to work out.

<text>The  (Gurmukhi: ਦਸਮ ਗ੍ਰੰਥ &quot;dasama gratha&quot;) is a collection of various poetic compositions attributed to Guru Gobind Singh. The text previously enjoyed an equal status with the Adi Granth, or Guru Granth Sahib, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and were installed side by side on the same platform. The &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; lost favor during the colonial period when reformist Singh Sabha Movement scholars couldn&#x27;t contextualize the reworkings of Puranic stories or the vast collection of &#x27;Tales of Deceit&#x27; Sri Charitropakhyan.

The standard edition of the text contains 1,428 pages with 17,293 verses in 18 sections. These are set in the form of hymns and poems mostly in the Braj language (Old western Hindi), with some parts in Avadhi, Punjabi, Hindi and Persian. The script is written almost entirely in Gurmukhi, except for the Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s letters to Aurangzeb—&quot;Zafarnama&quot; and the &quot;Hikaaitaan&quot;—written in the Persian alphabet.

The &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; contains hymns, from Hindu texts, which are a retelling of the feminine in the form of goddess Durga, an autobiography, letter to the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, as well as reverential discussion of warriors and theology. The scripture was recited in full within Nirmala Sikhs in the contemporary era. Parts of it are retold from Hindu Puranas, for the benefit of the common man, who had no access to Hindu texts of the time. Compositions of the Dasam &quot;Granth&quot; include Jaap Sahib, Tav-Prasad Savaiye and Kabiyo Baach Benti Chaupai which are part of the Nitnem or daily prayers and also part of the Amrit Sanchar or initiation ceremony of Khalsa Sikhs.

&quot;Zafarnama&quot; and &quot;Hikayats&quot; in a different style and format appended to it in the mid 18th century. Other manuscripts are said to include the &quot;Patna Birs&quot; and the &quot;Mani Singh Vali Bir&quot; all originated in mid to late 18th century. One of the 1698 CE Patna Manuscripts includes various &quot;apocryphal writings&quot; such as the &quot;Ugradanti&quot; and &quot;Bhagauti Astotar&quot;.

== Authorship ==
Although the compositions of the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; are traditionally accepted to be written by Guru Gobind Singh, there have been questions of the authenticity of the entirety of &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; from time of compilation. There are three major views on the authorship of the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;:
# The traditional view is that the entire work was composed by Guru Gobind Singh himself.
# The entire collection was compiled by the poets in the Guru&#x27;s entourage.
# Only a part of the work was composed by the Guru, while the rest was composed by the other poets.

In his religious court at Paonta and Anandpur, Guru Gobind Singh had employed 52 poets, who translated several classical texts into Braj Bhasha. Most of the writing compiled at Anandpur was lost while the Guru&#x27;s camp was crossing the Sirsa river before the Battle of Chamkaur in 1704. There were copiers available at the Guru&#x27;s place who made several copies of the writings, and other writings may have been included too which may have led to authenticity issues. There is a theory that later, Bhai Mani Singh compiled all the available works under the title &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;.

Traditionalist scholars claim that all the works in &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; were composed by the Guru himself, often on the basis of a letter attributed to Bhai Mani Singh. The veracity of this letter has been examined by scholars and found to be unreliable. Some others dispute the claim of the authorship, saying that some of the compositions included in &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; such as &quot;Charitropakhyan&quot; are &quot;out of tune&quot; with other Sikh scriptures, and must have been composed by other poets. Syan (2013) notes, &quot;Neither in colonial nor post-colonial Sikhism has the issue of the Dasam Granth authorship been satisfactorily resolved. What is germane, however, is that pre-colonial Sikh society wholeheartedly accepted the Dasam Granth as the work of Guru Gobind Singh.&quot;

=== Historical writings ===

The following are historical books after the demise of Guru Gobind Singh which mention that the compositions in the present &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; was written by Guru Gobind Singh:
* Rehitnama Bhai Nand Lal mentioned Jaap Sahib is an important Bani for a Sikh.
* Rehitnama Chaupa Singh Chibber quotes various lines from Bachitar Natak, 33 Swiayey, Chaupai Sahib, Jaap Sahib.
* In 1711, Sri Gur Sobha was written by the poet Senapat and mentioned a conversation of Guru Gobind Singh and Akal Purakh, and written three of its Adhyay on base of Bachitar Natak.
* In 1741, Parchian Srvadas Kian quoted lines from Rama Avtar, 33 Swaiyey, and mentioned Zafarnama with Hikayats.
* in 1751, Gurbilas Patshahi 10 – Koyar Singh Kalal, mentioned Guru Gobind Singh composed Bachitar Natak, Krisna Avtar, Bisan Avtar, Akal Ustat, Jaap Sahib, Zafarnama, Hikayats etc. This is first Granth mentioned Guruship of Guru Granth Shahib.
* In 1766, Kesar Singh Chibber in Bansavalinama writes that Guru Gobind Singh ordered the Guru Granth Sahib and Dasam Granth be kept separate. Kesar Singh frequently quotes Ugardanti, Bachitar Natak, Khalsa Mehima and many other compositions.
* In 1766, Sri Guru Mahima Parkash – Sarup Chand Bhalla, mentioned about various Banis of Guru Gobind Singh and compilation of &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;
* In 1790, Guru Kian Sakhian – Svarup Singh Kashish, mentioned Guru Gobind Singh composed, Bachitar Natak, Krishna Avtar, Shastarnaam Mala, 33 Swaiyey etc.
* In 1797, Gurbilas Patshahi 10 – Sukkha Singh, mentioned compositions of Guru Gobind Singh.
* In 1812, J. B. Malcolm, in Sketch of Sikhs mentioned the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; as Bani of Guru Gobind Singh.

== Structure ==
The standard print edition of the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;, since 1902, has 1,428 pages. However, many printed versions of the text in the contemporary era skip a major section (40%) because it is controversial.

The standard official edition contains 17,293 verses in 18 sections. These are set in the form of hymns and poems mostly in the Braj Bhasha (Old western Hindi), with some parts in Avadhi, Punjabi, Hindi, and the Persian language. The script is almost entirely the Gurmukhi script except for the letter of the Sikh Guru to Aurangzeb – &quot;Zafarnama&quot;, and the &quot;Hikayat&quot; in the Persian script.

=== Main compositions ===
The &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; has many sections covering a wide range of topics:
=== Other compositions ===

==== Ugardanti ====
Ugardanti (, pronunciation: ) is a poetic composition said to be written by Guru Gobind Singh, after the creation of the Khalsa Panth at Anandpur Sahib. The composition is present in Dasam Granth Bir Patna Sahib. The bani contains information about the creation of the Khalsa Panth, the dress code of the Sikhs, and is strictly against ritualism.

Etymologically, Ugardanti is a feminine term made of two words, Ugar means Fierce and Danti means Tooth. One having Fierce Tooth, is called Ugardanti. Guru Gobind Singh Ji invokes Adi Shakti in the form of the Fierce Toothed Ugardanti, writing various attributes of Ugardanti and asking for blessings and protection for the prosperity of the new Panth which is free from hypocrisy, ritualism, casteism, human worship and worships only One Non-Dual God.

In &quot;Bansavalinama Dasan Patshahian ka&quot; (1769), the author Kesar Singh Chibbar explains and quotes a few passages from Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s Ugardanti.

In &quot;Hum Hindu Nahi&quot;(1898 ), the author Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha, believed that Ugardanti Bani was not written by Guru Gobind Singh but by Bhai Sukha Singh, a priest at Patna. However, Sukha Singh&#x27;s works came into being after the Bansavalinama of Kesar Singh Chibbar.

Nihang and Namdhari Sikhs believe it to be written by Guru Gobind Singh and is part of their daily liturgy. It was and is read to inspire warriors to stand up for truth and righteousness in the face of tyranny and oppression. The Composition is divided into six verses called Chhands in which the syllables and the rhythm are arranged in a precisely controlled pattern. The Type of Chhandd used is Bhagvati Chhand.

==== Tav-Prasad Savaiye ====
Tav-Prasad Savaiye (, pronunciation: , lit. ‘exclusively you, in war song meter’) is a short composition of 10 stanzas which is part of daily liturgy among Sikhs (&quot;Nitnem&quot;). It was penned down by Guru Gobind Singh and is part of his composition &quot;Akal Ustat&quot; (The praise of God). This is an important composition which is read during Amrit Sanchar. This &quot;Bani&quot; appears in the Dasam Granth on pages 13 to 15, starting from Stanza 21 of Akal Ustat.

Tavprasad means &quot;with thy grace&quot;. This composition strongly rejects idolatry, pilgrimages, grave worshiping, samadhis of yogis and other ritualistic beliefs of Hinduism, Jainism and Islam as being of no use in attaining God if performed without the love of God and all his creation . It is included in Nitnem, the daily morning prayers of Sikhs, and recited after completing Jaap Sahib. It starts with &quot;Sravag Sudh Samuh Sidhan Ke&quot; and goes up to &quot;Koor Kriya Urjheo Sab Hi Jag&quot;. Among many famous quotes from Tav-Prasad Savaiye, &quot;Jin Prem Kiyo Tin Hi Prabhu Paayo&quot; is widely quoted by different scholars of different religions. In &quot;Dialogues on Universal Responsibility and Education&quot;, the Dalai Lama quoted it while giving lessons on love.

Tav-Prasad Savaiye is very important part of the Nitnem. Among other things Nitnem works as a shield for the Khalsa (Khalsa is a perfect human being, which is the vision of Guru Gobind Singh by the orders of Akal Purkh. Such a human is perfectly capable of defending himself and others from the attacks of enemy(both spiritual and temporal)). Specifically Savaiye act as a shield against the attacks of Pride, Ignorance, Hatred, Hypocrisy and Delusions.

== Role in Sikh liturgy, access ==
The compositions within &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; play a huge role in Sikh liturgy, which is prescribed by Sikh Rehat Maryada:
* Jaap Sahib is part of Nitnem, which Sikh recites daily in morning.
* Tav-Prasad Savaiye, again a bani of Nitnem, is part of Akal Ustat composition, which is recited daily in morning along with above.
* Benti Chaupai, is part of Sri Charitropakhyan, which is recited in morning as well as evening prayers.
* Jaap, Tav Prasad Savaiye and Chaupai are read while preparing Khande Batey Ki Pahul for Khalsa initiation.
* The first stanza of the Sikh ardās is from Chandi di Var.
* As per Sikh Rehat Maryada, a stanza of Chaubis Avtar, &quot;pae gahe jab te tumre&quot;, should be comprised in So Dar Rehras.

In the Nihang tradition – considered heretical by the Khalsa Sikhs, the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; is given equal scriptural status as the &quot;Adi Granth&quot; (first volume). Chandi di Var is also an important prayer among Nihang and Namdhari Sikhs.

Except for the liturgical portions and some cherrypicked verses of the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; that are widely shared and used, few Sikhs have read the complete &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; or know its contents. Most do not have access to it in its entirety, as the generic printed or translated versions do not include all its sections and verses. In its history, the entire text was in the active possession of the Khalsa soldiers.

== Manuscripts ==

The oldest manuscript of &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; is likely the Anandpuri Hazuri Bir (Not to be confused with the Anandpuri Marco Adi Granth). It is dated to 1698 CE. A few folio pages were definitely added later (Zafarnama and Hikayats), because they were composed after 1700 (circa 1705 CE), and are in a different style and format, and lack the folio numbers present on all pages elsewhere. These letters of Guru Gobind Singh may have been appended in the early 18th century. According to another view, the earliest surviving manuscript of the complete text is dated to 1713 CE (Bhai Mani Singh&#x27;s manuscript), and the early manuscript versions have minor variations with apocryphal writings.
Other important manuscripts include two Patna manuscripts both from 1698 CE found in Bihar, and the Mani Singh Vali Bir (1713 CE) in New Delhi. The Mani Singh Bir is a combined recension of the Adi Granth and Dasam Granth. It presents the Zafarnama and Hikayats in the Perso-Arabic Nastaliq script.

The early Anandpuri, Patna, and Mani Singh manuscripts include writings that are disputed in the contemporary era, as well as sections such as the &quot;Ugradanti&quot; and &quot;Sri Bhagauti Astotra&quot; that were removed from the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; codified in the 20th century by the &quot;Sodhak Committee&quot;. There is also a manuscript of the Dasam Granth attributed to Bhai Daya Singh with many Apocryphal Writings, as well as the 1765 Illuminated &quot;Patna Missal&quot; manuscript from Jammu.

According to the Indologist Wendy Doniger, many orthodox Sikhs credit the authorship and compilation of the earliest &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; manuscript to Guru Gobind Singh directly, while other Sikhs and some scholars consider the text to have been authored and compiled partly by him and partly by many poets in his court at Anandpur.

Prior to 1902, there were numerous incomplete portions of manuscripts of &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; in circulation within the Sikh community along with the complete, but somewhat variant, major versions such as the Anandpuri and Patna birs. In 1885, during the Singh Sabha Movement, an organization called the Gurmat Granth Pracharak Sabha was founded by Sikhs to study the Sikh literature. This organization, with a request from Amritsar Singh Sabha, established the Sodhak Committee in 1897. The members of this committee studied 32 manuscripts of &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; from different parts of the Indian subcontinent. The committee deleted some hymns found in the different old manuscripts of the text, merged the others and thus created a 1,428-page version thereafter called the standard edition of the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;. The standard edition was first published in 1902. It is this version that has predominantly been distributed to scholars and studied in and outside India. However, the prestige of the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; was well established in the Sikh community during the Sikh Empire, as noted in 1812 by colonial-era scholar Malcolm. According to Robin Rinehart – a scholar of Sikhism and Sikh literature, modern copies of the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; in Punjabi, and its English translations, often do not include the entire standard edition text and do not follow the same ordering either.

==Other compilations==
===Das Granthi===
A Das Granthi (ਦਸ ਗ੍ਰੰਥੀ) is a small religious booklet containing only few selected compositions from Dasam Granth. Das stands for &quot;Ten&quot; and Granthi stands for &quot;booklet&quot;. It means Booklet of 10th Guru of Sikhism. This booklet was created for beginners and lay readers for reading these compositions in daily liturgy for proper understanding.

There is no standardization of this booklet and various sects in Sikhism have their own versions. The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee contains eight texts namely, Jaap, Bachitra Natak, Chandi Charitra I, Shabad Hazare Patshahi 10, Akal Ustati, Chandi Charitra 2, Gian Prabodh and Chandi di Var.

== Apocryphal Dasam Granth writings ==

* Asfottak Kabitt

* Gobind Gita
* Rubai P. 10
* Uggardanti
* Raag Sorath P. 10 (Rajput Ghode)

<doc id="561634" wikidata="Q682741" url="?curid=561634" title="Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 (marketed in North America as simply the Mercedes-Benz 6.9) is the high-performance version of the W116 S-Class saloon. It was based on the extended-wheelbase version of the W116 S-Class platform, introduced in 1972, but equipped with an M100 V8 engine from their flagship Mercedes-Benz 600, uprated to 6.8 l, and featuring full hydropneumatic suspension, licensed from Citroën.

The 450SEL 6.9 was presented to the public at the Geneva Auto Show in 1974 as the successor to the original high-performance saloon from Mercedes-Benz, the 300SEL 6.3 (1968–1972). Like the 300SEL 6.3 before it, the special displacement number (6.9) was affixed to the trunk lid to differentiate itself from the regular 450SEL. The 450SEL 6.9 was produced in very limited numbers from 1975 to 1980.

The 450SEL 6.9 had the first full four-wheel hydropneumatic suspension system from Mercedes-Benz and was the world’s first passenger car to be fitted with a modern form of ABS, an electronic four-wheel multi-channel anti-lock braking system from Bosch, in 1978.

For several years, the 450SEL 6.9 was the quickest-accelerating and fastest saloon in the world, reaching in 7.4 seconds and top speed. 

The total production from 1975 to 1980 was 7,380 units, with 1,816 exported to the North American markets (United States and Canada) from 1977 to 1981.

==M100 engine==
The 6.3-litre M100 V8 engine, originally fitted to 600 and 300 SEL 6.3, was enlarged to 6.8 litres (6,834 cubic centimetres or 417 cubic inches) by boring it out to . The stricter emission regulations in the mid-1970s necessitated the larger displacement as to compensate for the lowered output. The fuel injection system was upgraded to the third-generation mechanically controlled, continuous-injection system Bosch K-Jetronic.

Due to its sheer size, the engineers fitted the dry sump oil lubrication system as to lower the engine height and preserve the low hood line. The dry sump system had larger capacity at 12 litres rather than 5 litres for the wet sump system fitted to the smaller M116 and M117 V8 engines. The dipstick was moved from the engine block to the oil tank’s filler cap. The larger oil capacity extended the oil change interval to 20,000 km (12,500 miles).

For the European and international markets, the M100 engine produced at 4,250 rpm and at 3,000 rpm. The 450 SEL 6.9 for the North American markets had the reduced output and compression ratio (8.0:1 instead of 8.8:1) and was fitted with catalysator that required lead-free petrol: at 4,000 rpm and at 2,500 rpm. The 450 SEL 6.9 sold in Australia had slightly reduced output due to Australia&#x27;s new 1977 emission regulations: at 4,200 rpm and at 2,800 rpm.

During its entire production run, the engine displacement of 6.8 litres was the largest V8 engine ever built by Mercedes-Benz and by any European manufacturer since the Second World War.

==Suspension==
The full hydropneumatic self-levelling suspension system from Mercedes-Benz was first introduced in 450SEL 6.9 as a standard equipment. The other W116 models used the hydropneumatic system for the rear suspension only as level control under heavy load (Option No. 48/0, &quot;Niveauregulierung&quot;). The full system was exclusive to 450SEL 6.9 until 1981 when the next generation, HPF II, was offered as an extra-cost option for W126 380SEL and 500SEL. The 600 and W109 used the air suspension for self-levelling.

The Mercedes-Benz system differentiated from Citroën system, introduced in 1954, in some ways. Mercedes-Benz used the timing chain to drive the hydraulic pump instead of rubber belt in Citroën system. Citroën system used a single pump to send the vegetable oil (and later mineral oil) to the brake boost, power steering, power clutch (when equipped with semi-automatic transmission), and hydropneumatic suspension system. Mercedes-Benz system had the separate pumps for brake boost, power steering, and hydropneumatic suspension, citing the better failsafe measures than Citroën in the event of a hydraulic failure. The Mercedes-Benz system contained the hard rubber dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven if the hydraulic pump or components failed. Both manufacturers had different approaches when the cars were parked and switched off. Citroën lowered themselves closer to the ground while Mercedes-Benz did not. Mercedes-Benz suspension system has the feature that maintains body level without squatting at the rear or diving in the front during the acceleration and braking respectively.

==North American market==

Initially, Mercedes-Benz did not plan on selling the 450SEL 6.9 in the United States given the oil crisis that hit the Americans very hard and increasingly tightening emission regulations. Mercedes-Benz had difficulties in meeting the European demand. However, the strong requests from the customers and dealers reversed the decision.

In the North American market, the 450SEL 6.9 was called simply the 6.9 and featured the model name on the right side of the trunk lid. The retail price was more than $38,230 ($193,291.51 adjusted for 2024) for the 1977 model year and increased to $52,995 ($196,213.19 adjusted for 2024) at the end of production in 1980.

The 6.9 was fitted with four sealed beam 5.75&quot; round capsule headlights with bezels and larger impact absorbing bumpers that lengthened the car by 11 inches. Due to the US FMVSS bumper standard, the variable height suspension was disabled, and the height adjustment knob was removed. To differentiate the 6.9 from other W116 models, the bumpers had a thick black rubber strip covering their entire width, and did not feature rubber bumper guards. 

The engine output was reduced to and due to the stricter emission standards.

==Price==

The retail price of 450SEL 6.9 was DM 69,930 at its launch in 1975 and was DM 81,247 at the end of its production in 1980. The 450SEL 6.9 had a premium of DM 25,000 to 30,000 over the 450SEL.

While the 450SEL 6.9 was visually indistinguishable from the other W116 models, it had wider wheels and tires along with 6.9 on the right side of trunk lid. The 6.9 had more standard features that were extra cost options in other W116 models: automatic HVAC system, power windows, power rear seats, headrests for the rear passengers, central locking system, headlamp washer and wiper system, heat-insulating glass, and a few other equipments.

==Interior features==
Despite the higher retail price, the interior of the 450SEL 6.9 was indistinguishable from the other W116 models except for the different type of wood trims, height adjustment knob, and two extra warning lamps in the instrument cluster for the low suspension pressure warning and height adjustment indicator. Heated seats for driver and front and rear passengers as well as electric sunroof were extra cost options. No power-assisted external rear view mirrors and seat adjustments, commonly fitted to luxury cars such as Cadillac and Rolls-Royce during the 1970s, were ever offered in the 450SEL 6.9.

The first-ever automatic HVAC system from Mercedes-Benz was introduced in the 450SEL 6.9 as a standard equipment and as optional extra-cost equipment in other W116 models. The automatic HVAC system was adapted from Chrysler Corporation and had a compressor from Harrison division of General Motors.

The 450SEL 6.9 had exclusive wood trim finished in burled walnut veneer on the dash and console instead of striated zebrano veneer as found in other W116 models.

==Cultural references==
* After the persistent rumours, the French director Claude Lelouche revealed the car he used to drive through Paris at a very high speed to the rendezvous point at Montmartre in his eight-minute film, &quot;C&#x27;était un rendez-vous&quot;. He used a 1976 450SEL 6.9 with the camera mounted under the front bumper. He used the sound track from the Ferrari 275 GTB, giving the impression that he drove a Ferrari.
* The 450SEL 6.9 was driven by Vincent, one of the protagonists in &quot;Ronin&quot;, and was involved in several of the film&#x27;s car chase scenes.
* In David Lynch&#x27;s 1996 film, &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, a 450SEL 6.9 was used as a major plot device, connecting all three main male characters in the film. In one scene, the hood was lifted up to reveal the 1,400-horsepower engine modification. In another scene, the car was used to push a Ford Thunderbird off the road despite the latter applying the brakes.

<text>Doris Batcheller Humphrey (October 17, 1895 – December 29, 1958) was an American dancer and choreographer of the early twentieth century. Along with her contemporaries Martha Graham and Katherine Dunham, Humphrey was one of the second generation modern dance pioneers who followed their forerunners – including Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis, and Ted Shawn – in exploring the use of breath and developing techniques still taught today. As many of her works were annotated, Humphrey continues to be taught, studied and performed.

==Early life==
Humphrey was born in Oak Park, Illinois, but grew up in Chicago, Illinois. She was the daughter of Horace Buckingham Humphrey, a journalist and one-time hotel manager, and Julia Ellen Wells, who had trained as a concert pianist. She was a descendant of pilgrim William Brewster who arrived on the Mayflower in 1620. In Chicago, with the encouragement of her mother, she studied with eminent ballet masters as well as with Mary Wood Hinman, who taught dance at her school, the Francis Parker School. While still at high school she undertook a concert tour of the western states as a dancer, with her mother as accompanist, in a group sponsored by the Santa Fe Railroad for its Workman&#x27;s Clubs.

Partly due to financial concerns Humphrey opened her own dance school, with her mother as manager and pianist, in 1913 at the age of 18. It was a great success, offering classic, gymnastic and ballroom dance for children and ballroom dance for young adults.

In 1917, at the instigation of Mary Wood Hinman, she moved to California and entered the Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts where she studied, performed, taught classes and learned choreography. Her creations from this era, &quot;Valse Caprice&quot; (&quot;Scarf Dance&quot;), &quot;Soaring&quot;, and &quot;Scherzo Waltz&quot; (&quot;Hoop Dance&quot;) are all still performed today. She remained involved for the next decade. Humphrey toured the Orient for two years followed by a successful career in American vaudeville theaters.

==Personal life==
Short in stature, Doris was no taller than 5&#x27;3&quot; and had a slender build. In 1932 she married Charles Woodford (a British Naval merchant.) She had one child, a son named Charles Humphrey Woodford (born 1933).

==Dancing through the Great Depression==
In 1928, Humphrey and Charles Weidman, who had worked closely with Humphrey, left the Denishawn School and moved to New York City. Along with Humphrey and Weidman, Martha Graham also rebelled against the Denishawn establishment during this time. Humphrey and Graham separately developed new ideas about the core dynamics of dance movement that eventually formed the basis of each of their techniques.

Humphrey&#x27;s theory explored the nuances of the human body&#x27;s responses to gravity, embodied in her principle of &quot;fall and recovery&quot;. She called this &quot;the arc between two deaths&quot;. At one extreme, an individual surrenders to the nature of gravity; at the other, one attempts to achieve balance. Through the fall and recovery principle, Humphrey is able to illustrate emotional and physical climax of struggling for stability and submitting to the laws of gravity.

Her choreography from these early years includes &quot;Air for the G String&quot;, &quot;Water Study&quot;, &quot;Life of the Bee&quot;, &quot;Two Ecstatic Themes&quot;, and &quot;The Shakers&quot;. Unlike the Denishawn approach in choreography, finding inspiration from abroad, Humphrey sought inspiration from within her home, America. &quot;The Shakers&quot;, about the 18th century American religious group, is a notable example of finding inspiration from America.

The Humphrey-Weidman Company was successful even in the Great Depression, touring America and developing new styles and new works based not on old tales but on current events and concerns. In the mid-1930s Humphrey created the &quot;New Dance Trilogy&quot;, a triptych comprising &quot;With My Red Fires&quot;, &quot;New Dance&quot;, and the now-lost &quot;Theater Piece&quot;. Though the three pieces were never performed together, they were danced to the score by Wallingford Rigger. Here Humphrey looks at the competitive lives of businessmen, working women, athletes, and actors.

Humphrey was a participant of the Federal Dance Project (FDP), created in the 1930s as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s Second New Deal. FDP was the first national program created to financially support dance and dancers.

Humphrey expanded her choreographic work to Broadway in 1933 with &quot;School for Husbands&quot; and again the following year with &quot;Life Begins at 8:40&quot;.

During the 1940s, Humphrey spent significant time with José Limón, one of her former students. After she retired from performing in 1944, due to arthritis, she became artistic director for the José Limón Dance Company and created a number of works for the company, including &quot;Day on Earth&quot;, &quot;Night Spell&quot;, &quot;Ruins and Visions&quot;, and &quot;Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias&quot;. Humphrey&#x27;s dance style was carried on and developed further by Limón and his dance company.

One of her last pieces, &quot;Dawn in New York&quot;, showed the strengths Humphrey demonstrated throughout her career – her mastery of the intricacies of large groups and her emphasis on sculptural shapes. Humphrey was on the original faculties of both The Bennington School of the Dance (1934) and The Juilliard School (1951), both directed by Martha Hill.

In 1952 Humphrey started directing a new dance company for children called The Merry-Go-Rounders.

She died in New York City on December 29, 1958, and was buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Forest Park, Illinois.

==Choreographic works and movement theory==
As previously stated, Humphrey had some very particular theories on the fundamentals of movement. Her theory of Fall and Recovery was the center point of all her movement. She described this as &quot;The arc between two deaths.&quot; Moreover, this idea was based in the change in center of gravity, balance and recovery. Humphrey theorized that moving away from center should be followed by an equal adjustment to return to center to prevent a fall. The more dramatic the movement, the more dramatic the recovery should be.

Humphrey also believed that movement should represent emotion but not to the same extent that Graham had. Her eye was more clinical, in a way, with most of her works relating to the interactions of an individual or group. As Graham had, she also &quot;believed that dance should provoke, stimulate, and inform rather than simply entertain.&quot; But where Graham had wished to explore the individual psyche, Humphrey wished to showcase individual and group dynamics from more of an outsider&#x27;s perspective. This thought process translated into using dances as metaphors for human situations and working in mostly abstractions to represent specific characters, events, or ideas. For example, &quot;Two Ecstatic Themes&quot; (1931) explored Humphrey&#x27;s own feelings about falling in love while still remaining a strong, independent woman. 

Humphrey&#x27;s most prominent works include &quot;Color Harmony&quot; (1928), &quot;Water Study&quot; (1928), &quot;Drama of Motion&quot; (1930), and &quot;The Shakers&quot; (1931). &quot;Color Harmony&quot; (1928) was her first independent concert after leaving Denishawn in 1928. She and Charles Weidman presented the work with &quot;Weidman as a slivery figure representing the artistic intelligence that organizes the mingled colors of the spectrum into a harmonious design.&quot; &quot;Water Study&quot; (1928) was Humphrey&#x27;s experiment of dancing without music. She wanted the dancers to move to their natural breathing patterns as they represented the natural movement of water. &quot;Drama of Motion&quot; (1930) was the next step in her experiment of dancing without music. She wanted dance to be an art that could stand on its own without the need of music or emotion and concentrated on the formal elements of movement such as design, rhythm, and dynamics. Her best known work however, brought music and emotion back into play. &quot;The Shakers&quot; (1931) was inspired by a Christian sect known as Shakers. They required members to be celibate and are known for shaking during times of worship. To make sure their members remain celibate they segregate the sexes during rituals. In Humphrey&#x27;s choreography she incorporates shaking movements to represent their sexual repression as well as the idea of being shaken clean of sin.

== Legacy ==
Shortly after her death in 1958, Humphrey&#x27;s book &quot;The Art of Making Dances&quot;, in which she shared her observations and theories on dance and composition, was published. In the introduction she observed that ballet had changed radically in the 20th century. &quot;Suddenly the dance,&quot; she said, &quot;the Sleeping Beauty, so long reclining in her dainty bed, had risen up with a devouring desire.&quot; She believed in emotions and movement moving &quot;from the inside out&quot;, but she also believed in working abstractly where specific events and characters were not illustrated in a way that made sense. For example, &quot;she believed that the concept of democracy was more convincingly conveyed by a fugue uniting four different themes than by a woman in red, white and blue&quot;.

Her theory of Fall and Recovery is still used to this day by many choreographers.

Thirty-five of Doris Humphrey&#x27;s dances are documented in Labanotation by the Dance Notation Bureau. Introductory material includes original casts, history of the dances, stylistic notes, and other information.

The book, &quot;Days on Earth: The Dance of Doris Humphrey&quot;, by Marcia B. Siegel was published in 1993. Siegel makes a case for Humphrey being one of the more important figures of modern dance.

Humphrey was inducted into the National Museum of Dance&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1987.

A street in her home town of Oak Park is named for her paternal grandfather, the Reverend Simon James Humphrey.

<text>Duple metre (or Am. duple meter, also known as duple time) is a musical metre characterized by a &quot;primary&quot; division of 2 beats to the bar, usually indicated by 2 and multiples (simple) or 6 and multiples (compound) in the upper figure of the time signature, with (cut time), , and (at a fast tempo) being the most common examples.

Shown below are a simple and a compound duple drum pattern.

Though the upper number &quot;must be&quot; divisible by 2, the mere fact that 2 evenly divides the upper figure does not in and of itself indicate a duple metre; it is only a prerequisite.

The most common time signature in rock, blues, country, funk, and pop is . Although jazz writing has become more adventurous since Dave Brubeck&#x27;s &quot;Time Out&quot;, the majority of jazz and jazz standards are still in &quot;common time&quot; ().

Duple time is common in many styles including the polka, well known for its obvious &quot;oom-pah&quot; duple feel. Compare to the waltz.

==Quadruple metre==
Quadruple metre (also &quot;quadruple time&quot;) is a musical metre characterized in modern practice by a primary division of 4 beats to the bar, usually indicated by 4 in the upper figure of the time signature, with (&quot;common time&quot;, also notated as ) being the most common example.

<text>Alexander Keith&#x27;s is a brewery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. It is part of Anheuser-Busch InBev, a holdings company based in Leuven, Belgium, which owns over 400 beer brands globally.

The brewery was founded in 1820 by Alexander Keith who had immigrated from Scotland three years previously. In 1928, the business was sold to Oland Brewery, which was in turn sold to the Labatt Brewing Company. Following a number of mergers and acquisitions, Labatt&#x27;s is now part of Anheuser-Busch InBev.

Since 1928, parent companies kept the brand alive, and by the 1990s Alexander Keith&#x27;s India Pale Ale (IPA) was the most popular beer in Nova Scotia. A number of other styles is also marketed. Although Alexander Keith products were originally produced in the Halifax brewery only for sale in the Maritimes, they are now produced at Anheuser-Busch InBev plants across Canada and America.

Archived recipes for beer made by the Alexander Keith&#x27;s Brewery in the early 1900s show high levels of hopping, with large all-malt mash ingredients and no use of corn, typical for beers of that time. In contrast, the modern beer marketed as Alexander Keith&#x27;s IPA is only 5% alcohol by volume and lightly hopped, which does not meet the accepted criteria for an India pale ale. At the 2016 Canadian Brewing Awards, Alexander Keith&#x27;s IPA won third place, not in the IPA category, but in the &quot;North American Style Blonde or Golden Ale&quot; category.

<doc id="561651" wikidata="Q5503033" url="?curid=561651" title="Fresh off the boat">
<text>The phrase fresh off the boat &quot;(FOB)&quot;, off the boat &quot;(OTB)&quot;, are sometimes-derogatory terms used to describe immigrants who have arrived from a foreign nation and have yet to assimilate into the host nation&#x27;s culture, language, and behavior, but still continue with their ethnic ideas and practices. Within Asian American circles in the United States, the phrase is considered politically incorrect and derogatory. It can also be used to describe the stereotypical behavior of new immigrants as, for example, their poor driving skills, that they are educated yet working low-skilled or unskilled jobs, and their use of broken English. The term originates in the early days of immigration, when people mostly migrated to other countries by ship. &quot;Fresh off the Boeing 707&quot; (in reference to the Boeing 707 jet) is sometimes used in the United States as a variation, especially amongst East, South and Southeast Asian immigrants. In the United Kingdom &quot;fresh off the boat&quot; (mostly in regard to Pakistanis and other South Asians, but can include other immigrant groups) are referred to as &quot;freshies&quot; or simply FOBs.

In the sociology of ethnicity, this term can be seen as an indicator of a nature of diasporic communities, or communities that have left their country of origin and migrated, usually permanently, to another country. The term has also been adapted by immigrants themselves or others in their community who see the differentiation as a source of pride, where they have retained their culture and have not lost it to assimilation. In fact, instead of taking this harm-intended phrase as an insult, many immigrants and more specifically, East and South Asians (especially their American-born children) may use this term to describe their cultural background habits and fashion sense, for example &quot;fobby clothing&quot;, &quot;fobby glasses&quot;, &quot;fobby accent&quot;, and others. Similarly, some in the Arab-American community in Michigan refer to themselves as &quot;Boaters&quot;, using it as a term of endearment, while others see it as an insult.

Daryanani Law Group documents the struggles of ethnic communities to understand the English language. From high-schoolers to college students like Rishikesh Balaji, a &quot;fob&quot; mentioned in the article, common societal events like not knowing who OJ Simpson is and confusing it with Homer Simpson are day-to-day struggles that can be difficult and often be a comedic focus in their lives.
In some instances, an &quot;ethnic community&quot; may find it difficult to assimilate with their new culture. Although some try to assimilate, they may fail due to the very swift transition to the host continent.

<text>Al Diwaniyah ( &quot;ad-Dīwānīyah&quot;), also spelt Diwaniya, is the capital city of Iraq&#x27;s Al-Qādisiyyah Governorate. In 2014 the population was estimated at 700,000.

==Overview==
The area around Al Diwaniyah, which is well irrigated from the nearby Euphrates river, is often considered to be one on the most fertile parts of Iraq, and is heavily cultivated. The town is located on the main rail transport corridor between Baghdad and Basra in south-central Iraq.

For birdwatchers, Al-Diwaniyah is a city with a rich bird list, as the city has a wide range of biodiversity. Al-Qadisiyah consists of vast agricultural areas, wetlands, arid zones, and semi-desert areas.

The city is the site of a tire manufacturing plant that once provided tires for much of Iraq. The plant is still active as of 2008.

Al-Diwaniyah is the headquarters of the Iraqi Army&#x27;s 8th Division.

== Climate ==
Al Diwaniyah has a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) in the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system.

<text>The IDEA League is an alliance among five leading European universities of technology: 

* Chalmers University of Technology 
* Delft University of Technology 
* ETH Zürich 
* Polytechnic University of Milan 
* RWTH Aachen University 

On October 6, 1999, the IDEA league was formed by the signing of a memorandum of understanding between four leading European universities of technology: Imperial College London, Delft University of Technology, ETH Zürich, and RWTH Aachen University. In 2006, ParisTech joined the collaboration. As of 2014, Chalmers University of Technology is a member of the IDEA League network. In 2016, Polytechnic University of Milan joined the IDEA League.

Each member has a respectable research-oriented profile and is the largest producer of engineering and science graduates in its own country. One of the IDEA League&#x27;s main ambitions is to re-establish Europe as a technological and scientific leader by bundling academic resources and knowledge. The term IDEA comes from the first letter of each of the founding institutions. 

Imperial College London confirmed its decision to withdraw from the IDEA League with effect from December 2012. At the end of 2013, Paris Tech left the IDEA League because the university was restructuring in connection with the newly created Paris-Saclay campus. 

Currently, three schools of the members of the alliance offer a Joint Masters in Applied Geophysics, where students spend one semester at each university (Delft University of Technology, ETH Zürich and RWTH Aachen University), then spend the fourth semester doing their thesis at one of the schools or in industry. The programme builds on the strengths and the complementary expertise in Earth Science at the three universities. It offers a combination of study and research. During the program students can specialize in either hydrocarbon exploration and management or environmental and engineering investigations, including geothermal energy exploration and management, and will also receive a solid background in the other speciality.

Students of the IDEA League universities are represented by IDEALiStiC.

<doc id="561662" wikidata="Q2092296" url="?curid=561662" title="Tuplet">
<text>In music, a tuplet (also irrational rhythm or groupings, artificial division or groupings, abnormal divisions, irregular rhythm, gruppetto, extra-metric groupings, or, rarely, contrametric rhythm) is &quot;any rhythm that involves dividing the beat into a different number of equal subdivisions from that usually permitted by the time-signature (e.g., triplets, duplets, etc.)&quot; This is indicated by a number, or sometimes two indicating the fraction involved. The notes involved are also often grouped with a bracket or (in older notation) a slur.

The most common type of tuplet is the triplet.

==Terminology==
The modern term &#x27;tuplet&#x27; comes from a rebracketing of compound words like quintu(s)-(u)plet and sextu(s)-(u)plet, and from related mathematical terms such as &quot;tuple&quot;, &quot;-uplet&quot; and &quot;-plet&quot;, which are used to form terms denoting multiplets (&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, entries &quot;multiplet&quot;, &quot;-plet, &quot;comb. form&quot;&quot;, &quot;-let, &quot;suffix&quot;&quot;, and &quot;-et, &quot;suffix&quot;1&quot;). An alternative modern term, &quot;irrational rhythm&quot;, was originally borrowed from Greek prosody where it referred to &quot;a syllable having a metrical value not corresponding to its actual time-value, or ... a metrical foot containing such a syllable&quot; (&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, entry &quot;irrational&quot;). The term would be incorrect if used in the mathematical sense (because the note-values are rational fractions) or in the more general sense of &quot;unreasonable, utterly illogical, absurd&quot;.

Alternative terms found occasionally are &quot;artificial division&quot;, &quot;abnormal divisions&quot;, &quot;irregular rhythm&quot;, and &quot;irregular rhythmic groupings&quot;. The term &quot;polyrhythm&quot; (or &quot;polymeter&quot;), sometimes incorrectly used instead of &quot;tuplets&quot;, actually refers to the simultaneous use of opposing time signatures.

Besides &quot;triplet&quot;, the terms &quot;duplet&quot;, &quot;quadruplet&quot;, &quot;quintuplet&quot;, &quot;sextuplet&quot;, &quot;septuplet&quot;, and &quot;octuplet&quot; are used frequently. The terms &quot;nonuplet&quot;, &quot;decuplet&quot;, &quot;undecuplet&quot;, &quot;dodecuplet&quot;, and &quot;tredecuplet&quot; had been suggested but up until 1925 had not caught on. By 1964 the terms &quot;nonuplet&quot; and &quot;decuplet&quot; were usual, while subdivisions by greater numbers were more commonly described as &quot;group of eleven notes&quot;, &quot;group of twelve notes&quot;, and so on.

== Triplet ==

The most common tuplet is the triplet (German &quot;Triole&quot;, French &quot;triolet&quot;, Italian &quot;terzina&quot; or &quot;tripletta&quot;, Spanish &quot;tresillo&quot;). Whereas normally two quarter notes (crotchets) are the same duration as a half note (minim), three triplet quarter notes have that same duration, so the duration of a triplet quarter note is the duration of a standard quarter note.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 2/4
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
 c4 c
 \tuplet 3/2 { c4 c c }
&lt;/score&gt;

Similarly, three triplet eighth notes (quavers) are equal in duration to one quarter note. If several note values appear under the triplet bracket, they are all affected the same way, reduced to their original duration.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 2/4
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
 c8 c c c
 \tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c } \tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }
&lt;/score&gt;

The triplet indication may also apply to notes of different values, for example a quarter note followed by one eighth note, in which case the quarter note may be regarded as two triplet eighths tied together.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 2/4
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
 \tuplet 3/2 { c4 c8 } \tuplet 3/2 { c8 c4 }
&lt;/score&gt;

In some older scores, rhythms like this would be notated as a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth note as a kind of shorthand presumably so that the beaming more clearly shows the beats.

== Tuplet notation ==

=== Notation ===
Tuplets are typically notated either with a bracket or with a number above or below the beam if the notes are beamed together. Sometimes, the tuplet is notated with a ratio (instead of just a number) — with the first number in the ratio indicating the number of notes in the tuplet and the second number indicating the number of normal notes they have the same duration as — or with a ratio and a note value.

:&lt;score&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 5/4
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
 \tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }
 \once \override TupletBracket.bracket-visibility = ##t \tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }
 \once \override TupletNumber.text = &quot;3:2&quot; \tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }
 \once \override TupletNumber.text = &quot;3:2♪&quot; \tuplet 3/2 { c8 c c }
&lt;/score&gt;

=== Rhythm ===

==== Simple meter ====
For other tuplets, the number indicates a ratio to the next &quot;lower&quot; normal value in the prevailing meter (a power of 2 in simple meter). So a quintuplet (quintolet or pentuplet) indicated with the numeral 5 means that five of the indicated note value total the duration normally occupied by four (or, as a division of a dotted note in compound time, three), equivalent to the &quot;second&quot; higher note value. For example, five quintuplet eighth notes total the same duration as a half note (or, in or compound meters such as , , etc. time, a dotted quarter note).

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 2/4
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
 c8 c c c
 \tuplet 5/4 { c8 c c c c }
 c2
&lt;/score&gt;

Some numbers are used inconsistently: for example septuplets (septolets or septimoles) usually indicate 7 notes in the duration of 4—or in compound meter 7 for 6—but may sometimes be used to mean 7 notes in the duration of 8. Thus, a septuplet lasting a whole note can be written with either quarter notes (7:4) or eighth notes (7:8).

:&lt;score&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 4/4
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
 \tuplet 7/4 { c4 c c c c c c }
 \tuplet 7/8 { c8 c c c c c c }
&lt;/score&gt;

To avoid ambiguity, composers sometimes write the ratio explicitly instead of just a single number. This is also done for cases like 7:11, where the validity of this practice is established by the complexity of the figure. A French alternative is to write &quot;pour&quot; (&quot;for&quot;) or &quot;de&quot; (&quot;of&quot;) in place of the colon, or above the bracketed &quot;irregular&quot; number. This reflects the French usage of, for example, &quot;six-pour-quatre&quot; as an alternative name for the &quot;sextolet&quot;.

There are disagreements about the sextuplet (pronounced with stress on the first syllable, according to Baker—which is also called sestole, sestolet, sextole, or sextolet. This six-part division may be regarded either as a triplet with each note divided in half (2 + 2 + 2)—therefore with an accent on the first, third, and fifth notes—or else as an ordinary duple pattern with each note subdivided into triplets (3 + 3) and accented on both the first and fourth notes. This is indicated by the beaming in the example below.

:&lt;score&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 2/4
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
 \tuplet 6/4 { c16 \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c }
 \tuplet 6/4 { c16 c \set stemRightBeamCount = #1 c \set stemLeftBeamCount = #1 c c c }
&lt;/score&gt;

Some authorities treat both groupings as equally valid forms, while others dispute this, holding the first type to be the &quot;true&quot; (or &quot;real&quot;) sextuplet, and the second type to be properly a &quot;double triplet&quot;, which should always be written and named as such. Some go so far as to call the latter, when written with a numeral 6, a &quot;false&quot; sextuplet. Still others, on the contrary, define the sextuplet precisely and solely as the double triplet, and a few more, while accepting the distinction, contend that the true sextuplet has no internal subdivisions—only the first note of the group should be accented.)

==== Compound meter ====
In compound meter, even-numbered tuplets can indicate that a note value is changed in relation to the dotted version of the next higher note value. Thus, two duplet eighth notes (most often used in meter) take the time normally totaled by three eighth notes, equal to a dotted quarter note. Four quadruplet (or quartole) eighth notes would also equal a dotted quarter note. The duplet eighth note is thus exactly the same duration as a dotted eighth note, but the duplet notation is far more common in compound meters.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 6/8
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 100
 c8 c c c c c
 \tuplet 2/3 { c8 c } c8. c
 \tuplet 4/3 { c8 c c c } c16. c c c
 c2.
&lt;/score&gt;

A duplet in compound time is more often written as 2:3 (a dotted quarter note split into two duplet eighth notes) than 2: (a dotted quarter note split into two duplet quarter notes), even though the former is inconsistent with a quadruplet also being written as 4:3 (a dotted quarter note split into four quadruplet eighth notes).

=== Nested tuplets ===
On occasion, tuplets are used &quot;inside&quot; tuplets. These are referred to as &quot;nested tuplets&quot;.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \new RhythmicStaff {
 \clef percussion
 \time 2/4
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 4 = 68
 \once \override TupletBracket.bracket-visibility = ##t \tuplet 5/4 {c8[ \tuplet 3/2 { c16 c c] } c4 \tuplet 7/4 { c32[ c c c c c c] } } c2
&lt;/score&gt;

== Counting ==
Tuplets can produce rhythms such as the hemiola or may be used as polyrhythms when played against the regular duration. They are extrametric rhythmic units. The example below shows sextuplets in quintuplet time.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot; override_midi=&quot;Sextuplet against five rhythm.mid&quot;&gt;
« \relative c&#x27; {
 \override Staff.StaffSymbol.line-positions = #&#x27;(-2 2)
 \clef percussion
 \time 5/4
 \override TupletNumber.text = #tuplet-number::calc-fraction-text
 \tuplet 6/5 { e4 e e e e e } e4
} \\ \relative c&#x27; {
 a4 a a a a a
»
&lt;/score&gt;

Tuplets may be counted, most often at extremely slow tempos, using the least common multiple (LCM) between the original and tuplet divisions. For example, with a 3-against-2 tuplet (triplets) the LCM is 6. Since and the quarter notes fall every three counts (overlined) and the triplets every two (underlined):

This is fairly easily brought up to tempo, and depending on the music may be counted in tempo, while 7-against-4, having an LCM of 28, may be counted at extremely slow tempos but must be played intuitively (&quot;felt out&quot;) at tempo:
To play a half-note (minim) triplet accurately in a bar of , count eighth-note triplets and tie them together in groups of four

:&lt;score&gt;
« \relative c&#x27; {
 \override Staff.StaffSymbol.line-positions = #&#x27;(-2 2)
 \clef percussion
 \time 4/4
 \tuplet 3/2 { e4.~ e8 e4~ e e8~ e4. } e4
} \\ \relative c&#x27; {
 \tuplet 3/2 { a2 a a } a4
»
&lt;/score&gt;

With a stress on each target note, one would count: 1 – 2 – 3  1 – 2 – 3  1 – 2 – 3  1 – 2 – 3  1
The same principle can be applied to quintuplets, septuplets, and so on.

== In African music ==

Tuplet is featured in South African music, especially within gqom and its variants, core tribe and taxi kick.

<text>Alexander Keith (5 October 1795 – 14 December 1873) was a Canadian businessman, politician, Freemason and founder of Alexander Keith&#x27;s Brewery.

==Business==
After learning the brewing trade from his uncle in Northern England, Keith emigrated to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1817 and became manager at a brewery, which he bought out in 1820. In 1822, he moved the brewery to larger facilities and, in 1836, built a new brewery.

The end of slavery in the British and French Caribbean reduced the availability of sugar for rum-making, and other beverages grew in popularity. Beverages brewed by Keith included spruce beer, porter, ginger wine, and strong ale. 
The brewery is now part of Anheuser-Busch InBev.

From 1837, he served in senior management of various companies, including the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Halifax Fire Insurance Company, Colonial Life Assurance Company, the Halifax Gas, Light, and Water Company, the Provincial Permanent Building, and Investment Society.

==Political career==
In 1841, he was elected to the city council of Halifax and was elected mayor in 1843, 1853, and 1854. In 1843, he was appointed to the Legislative Council of Nova Scotia, becoming its president from 1867 until his death in 1873.

Keith served with several fraternal and charitable societies, including as president of the North British Society and Grand Master of the Freemasons.

==Personal life==
Born in Caithness, Scotland in 1795, Keith immigrated to Nova Scotia in 1817. He married Sarah Ann Stalcup in 1822, and they had three children, all of whom died before reaching adulthood. Sarah Ann Stalcup died in 1832, and a year later Keith married Eliza Keith, with whom he had eight children. Architect William Hay began construction of Keith&#x27;s new residence, Keith Hall, in 1863. The palazzo mixes styles including baroque and a mansard roof. He died in Halifax in 1873 and is buried at Camp Hill Cemetery. His estate at death was evaluated at $251,000.

<doc id="561666" wikidata="Q366790" url="?curid=561666" title="Moisei Uritsky">
<text>Moisei Solomonovich Uritsky (; ; – 30 August 1918) was a Bolshevik revolutionary leader in Russia. After the October Revolution, he was the chief of the Cheka secret police of the Petrograd Soviet. Uritsky was assassinated by Leonid Kannegisser, a military cadet, who was executed shortly afterwards.

==Family==

Uritsky was born in the city of Cherkasy, then part of the Kiev Governorate, to a Jewish Litvak family. His father, a merchant, died when Moisei was little and his mother raised her son by herself. He attended the Bila Tserkva Gymnasium, supporting himself through teaching and became an active social democrat.

==Early political career==
Moisei Uritsky studied law at the St. Vladimir Imperial University of Kiev. During his studies he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and organized an underground network for importing and distributing political literature. In 1897, he was arrested and exiled for running an illegal mimeograph press. Becoming involved in the revolutionary movement, he participated in the revolutionary Jewish Bund. In 1903, he became a Menshevik. His activities in St Petersburg during the 1905 Revolution earned him a second term of exile. Along with Alexander Parvus, he was active in dispatching revolutionary agents to infiltrate the Imperial security apparatus.

==Russian Revolution==
In 1914, he emigrated to France and contributed to the Party newspaper &quot;Our Word&quot;. Back in Russia after the February Revolution of 1917, Uritsky became a member of the Mezhraiontsy group. A few months before the October Revolution, he joined the Bolsheviks and was elected to their Central Committee in July 1917. Uritsky played a leading role in the Bolsheviks&#x27; armed take-over in October and was later made head of the Petrograd Cheka secret police. In this position Uritsky coordinated the pursuit and prosecution of members of the nobility, military officers, rival socialists, ranking Russian Orthodox Church clerics, and anyone who opposed the Bolsheviks.
Because Uritsky was against Lenin&#x27;s Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, he resigned his post in 1918, like Bukharin, Bubnov, Piatakov, Dzerzhinsky and Smirnov. On March 4, 1918, the Petrograd committee published the first number of the journal &quot;Kommunist&quot;, the public organ of the &quot;left communist&quot; opposition, as directed by Radek and Uritsky. The Extraordinary Seventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which was held between March 6 and 8, 1918, rejected the &quot;Theses on the Present Situation&quot; that was submitted as a resolution by the &quot;Left Communists&quot;. The &quot;Left Communists&quot; Lomov and Uritsky, who were elected to the Central Committee, stated at the Congress that they would not work in the Central Committee, and did not begin work there for several months in spite of insistent demands from the Central Committee.

On May 25, 1918, with the Revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion, the Russian Civil War began and Uritsky resumed his position on the Central Committee. An opponent of the death penalty, he nevertheless signed execution warrants approved by his Committee.

==Assassination==
Leonid Kannegisser, a young military cadet of the Imperial Russian Army, assassinated Uritsky on , outside the Petrograd Cheka headquarters in retaliation for the execution of his friend and other officers. Following this event, along with the assassination attempt on Lenin by Socialist Revolutionary Fanny Kaplan on August 30, the Bolsheviks began a wave of persecution known as the Red Terror. Palace Square in Petrograd was known as Uritsky Square from 1918 to 1944. There are still many streets named after him in Russia. 

Uritsky was buried with honours on the Field of Mars in Petrograd on 2 September 1918.

<text>Michael Wharton (19 April 1913 – 23 January 2006) was a British newspaper columnist who wrote under the pseudonym Peter Simple in the British &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;. He began work on the &quot;Way of the World&quot; column with illustrator Michael ffolkes three times a week in early 1957, and wrote the column four times a week for a lengthy period ending in 1987. On 13 May 1990 he began a weekly &quot;Peter Simple&quot; column in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, before returning to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; as a weekly columnist on 8 March 1996. He remained there until his death, aged 92, in 2006, his last column appearing on 20 January 2006.

==Life and career==
Wharton was born as Michael Bernhard Nathan, the son of a businessman of German-Jewish origin, at Shipley, in the West Riding of Yorkshire (&quot;Wharton&quot; was the maiden name of his mother). Wharton was educated at Bradford Grammar School and Lincoln College, Oxford. His career at Oxford was undistinguished, partly because he spent his time writing &quot;Sheldrake&quot;, a novel that had little success when published in 1958. After Oxford, Wharton served in the Royal Artillery from 1940 to 1946, rising to the rank of Major (acting Lieutenant-Colonel), &quot;but&quot;, in his own words, &quot;only in Intelligence&quot;. He then worked for the BBC as a producer and scriptwriter, but left in 1956.

His two volumes of quasi-autobiography, &quot;The Missing Will&quot; and &quot;A Dubious Codicil&quot;, combined his fantasy world with the mundane reality of the life as a jobbing journalist. Wharton married three times. His daughter and literary executor, Jane Wharton, works as a psychotherapist.

==Wharton&#x27;s characters==

The column satirised what Wharton saw as modern, fashionable ideas, and readers often claimed to recognise his invented characters in real people. Not fictional was the column&#x27;s presiding spirit, Colonel Sibthorp, an eccentric and reactionary Victorian Member of Parliament, about whom Wharton made a BBC radio documentary in 1954 and then a &quot;centenary celebration&quot; the following year.

==Controversy==
&quot;Fulminator&quot;, in his &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; blog, said of Wharton:

Wharton’s political views were so far removed from the mainstream that they’re practically unclassifiable – a feudalist and a rabid reactionary, certainly (he invented the fictitious Feudal and Reactionary Herald). He hated “Progress”, loathed communism and socialism with a passion, and wasn’t keen on capitalism or money-grubbing in general.

Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot; J. W. M. Thompson suggested:

As befitted a satirist who was wounded by the changes he observed in his country, he had a profound attachment to the land and a true Tory&#x27;s nostalgia for an idealised vision of its past.

Wharton consistently criticised and ridiculed what he described as the &quot;race relations industry&quot;, and one of his most famous comic creations was the &quot;prejudometer&quot;, an anti-racist instrument that supplied readings in prejudons, the &quot;internationally recognised scientific unit of racial prejudice&quot;, when pointed at a suspected racist. Concerned individuals could even point the prejudometer at themselves:

At 3.6 degrees on the Alibhai-Brown scale, it sets off a shrill scream that will not stop until you&#x27;ve pulled yourself together with a well-chosen anti-racist slogan.

Wharton was accused in his &quot;Times&quot; obituary of &quot;sometimes veer[ing] into the area of straightforward racism&quot; and of being- despite his own Jewish ancestry- &quot;prone to anti-semitic innuendo&quot; for such passages as this:

Almost single-handed, Ariel Sharon may have ended the Jews&#x27; virtual immunity from hostile criticism that Hitler&#x27;s persecution assured for more than 50 years. Anti-semitism is stirring. So far it may be only the so-called &quot;anti-semitism&quot; of people who think of the immense influence the Jews have in the world, and wonder whether it is always, everywhere and in every way an influence for good. First that; but later, for worse, the real thing.

However the quote occurs in a context of a passage gleefully satirising the Boycott Israel movement.

His obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot; pursued the same thread:

In his comment paragraphs, he aired a conservatism light years to the right of most conservatives, stealing sometimes into fleeting, only half-retracted, laments for the Europe that Hitler&#x27;s New Order might have created.

Michael Wharton held Adolf Hitler to be a radical, a revolutionary totally opposed to conservative principles.

==Related columns==
Wharton wrote four columns in a week for the last time from 25–28 August 1987. After Wharton expressed his desire to write less often, &quot;Way of the World&quot; was written initially three times a week, and subsequently twice weekly until the spring of 1990, by Christopher Booker under the name &quot;Peter Simple II&quot;, with Wharton continuing to write the column once a week initially on Fridays, but then on Thursdays until 3 May 1990. In 1990 the &quot;Peter Simple&quot; column and the &quot;Way of the World&quot; column became fully separate entities, and for the next ten years (7 May 1990 – 16 December 2000) the &quot;Way of the World&quot; column was written by Auberon Waugh, who died in January 2001. It was then written by the satirist Craig Brown until he left the &quot;Telegraph&quot; late in 2008. A. N. Wilson began to write a column also under the title &quot;Peter Simple II&quot; in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; on 26 February 2006, but it did not last long.

<doc id="561681" wikidata="Q7521194" url="?curid=561681" title="Simran">
<text>Simran (Gurmukhi: ਸਿਮਰਨ, pronunciation: ; ; from Sanskrit: , &quot;smaraṇa&quot;, &#x27;to remember, reminisce, recollect&#x27;), in spirituality, is a Hindi and Punjabi word referring to the continuous remembrance of the finest aspect of the self, and/or the continuous remembrance (or feeling) of God. This state is maintained continuously while carrying out the worldly works outside.

== Sant Mat ==
In Sant Mat, the word simran is used for the spiritual practice of repeating the mantra given by the Satguru during initiation. The mantra itself is also called Simran. Simran repetition is done during meditation and also outside it.

== Sikhism ==
&quot;Simran&quot;—commonly used as a verb in Gurmukhi—refers to &#x27;meditating&#x27; on the name (&quot;nām&quot;) of God. Sikhism is a distinct faith, whereby God can be realized purely through individual devotion, without subjection to rites and rituals by priests or other intermediaries.

According to the Guru Granth Sahib, through simran, one is purified and attains salvation (&quot;mukti&quot;). This is because &quot;si-mar&quot; means &#x27;to die over&#x27;, thus indicating the death of ego, allowing the realization of ultimate truth (&quot;sach&quot;) to appear.

On page 202 of the Guru Granth Sahib:

This hymn teaches that a person who wishes to gain from this human life must attain a higher spiritual state by becoming free of attachment by realizing emptiness of worldly phenomena. Thereby, merit is acquired by devoutly repeating, comprehending, and living by the sacred word every day so as to progressively reveal the divine and ultimate truth to the person who earnestly seeks it:

Guru Ram Das says in &quot;Sarang ki var&quot; (Guru Granth Sahib, 1242):

<text>The plain prinia (Prinia inornata), also known as the plain wren-warbler or white-browed wren-warbler, is a small cisticolid warbler found in southeast Asia. It is a resident breeder from Pakistan and India to south China and southeast Asia. It was formerly included in the tawny-flanked prinia (&quot;Prinia subflava&quot;), resident in Africa south of the Sahara. The two are now usually considered to be separate species.

==Description==
These 13–14-cm long warblers have short rounded wings, a longish tail, strong legs and a short black bill. In breeding plumage, adults are grey-brown above, with a short white supercilium and rufous fringes on the closed wings. The underparts are whitish-buff. The sexes are identical.

In winter, the upperparts are a warmer brown, and the underparts more buff. The tail is longer than in summer. There are a number of races differing in plumage shade. The endemic race in Sri Lanka retains summer plumage, including the shorter tail, all year round.

==Biology==
This skulking passerine bird is typically found in wet lowland grassland, open woodland, scrub and sometimes gardens. The plain prinia builds its nest in a shrub or tall grass and lays three to six eggs. (The tawny-flanked prinia nests in herbage and lays two to four eggs.)

Like most warblers, the plain prinia is insectivorous. The song is a repetitive &quot;&quot;.

<text>The Federal Court of Justice ( ,  ) is the highest court of civil and criminal jurisdiction in Germany. Its primary responsibility is the final appellate review of decisions by lower courts for errors of law. While, legally, a decision by the Federal Court of Justice is only binding with respect to the individual case in which it enters, &quot;de facto&quot; the court&#x27;s interpretation of the law is followed by lower courts with almost no exception. Decisions handed down by the Federal Court of Justice can only be vacated by the Federal Constitutional Court for violating a provision of the German constitution, the Basic Law.

In addition to the court&#x27;s appellate duties, a few judges of the Federal Court of Justice act as investigating judges in criminal investigations led by the Public Prosecutor General for a small number of exceptional offenses (such as crimes against humanity and the formation of terrorist organisations). As such, they are responsible for issuing search and arrest warrants, among other things.

The German legal order has different supreme courts for the different branches of its judiciary. The four sister supreme courts of the Federal Court of Justice are the Federal Administrative Court (for administrative matters), the Federal Fiscal Court (for tax matters), the Federal Labor Court (for matters of labour law), and the Federal Social Court (for social security matters).

The seat of the Federal Court of Justice is in Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg. Two criminal divisions of the court are based in Leipzig, Saxony.

== History ==
=== Predecessors ===
The , which was established in 1495 as the highest court of the Holy Roman Empire, is often viewed as the institutional origin of supreme court jurisprudence in Germany. The court arose out of an attempt by the Imperial Estates to counter the influence of the Emperor, which led to the somewhat unusual circumstance of the coexistence of two supreme courts with concurrent jurisdiction over most matters. The emperor&#x27;s own Aulic Council () in Vienna had sole jurisdiction over criminal cases, however.

As the Empire was dissolved in 1806, so were the two supreme courts. What ensued was a prolonged period of judicial independence of the dozens of newly-sovereign German states within the German Confederation. In the states of central and northern Germany, this changed following the foundation of the North German Confederation, where the Leipzig-based commenced operation in August 1870. In the beginning, the court&#x27;s supreme appellate jurisdiction was largely limited to trade law matters, but after the southern German states joined the Confederation in November 1870 to form the German Empire, the court—now known as —received jurisdiction over various additional areas of civil law.

In 1879, the was replaced with the . Also located in Leipzig, the enjoyed far broader supreme appellate jurisdiction than its predecessors, encompassing all civil and criminal matters arising in the Empire. The enactment of a unified Imperial Penal Code in 1872 added to the significance of the court. In the wake of Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the , like all German courts, was closed, and its administration subsequently dismantled, by proclamation of General Eisenhower of the United States Army on 18 April 1945.

In the British occupation zone, the Supreme Court for the British Zone () came into operation in 1948. The court was tasked with ensuring the uniform jurisprudence within the zone; to that end, its scope of jurisdiction and its procedural rules largely followed the example of the . The foundation of the Bizonal Economic Council by the British and the Americans also led to the establishment of a German High Court for the Combined Economic Area () with supreme appellate jurisdiction over matters of the public and private economic law created through Bizonal legislation.

=== Establishment ===
In May 1949, the Basic Law () was enacted, establishing the Federal Republic of Germany. Article 96(1) of the Basic Law provided that &quot;higher federal courts shall be established for the spheres of ordinary, administrative, finance, labour and social jurisdiction.&quot; Roughly a year later, it was decided by the German federal parliament, the &quot;Bundestag&quot;, that the &quot;higher federal court&quot; of ordinary (i.e., civil and criminal) jurisdiction was to be named (Federal Court of Justice) and that its seat was to be in the city of Karlsruhe. The location of the new supreme courts had been a matter of considerable debate at the time. Karlsruhe&#x27;s most serious contender had been Cologne, where both the Supreme Court for the British Zone and the German High Court for the Combined Economic Area were based, but the Karlsruhe proposal ultimately found a large majority in the relevant parliamentary committee.

The Federal Court of Justice was established effective 1 October 1950 and began operating a day later. The Supreme Court for the British Zone ceased operations a day earlier and all cases pending before the court were transferred to the Federal Court of Justice. Of the 54 judgeships initially authorised for the court, only 12 were immediately filled, although that number quickly rose to 42 within the first three months of the court&#x27;s operation; by July 1952 it stood at 86. New divisions were established, including a criminal division based in Berlin, 500 kilometres north-east of Karlsruhe. The steep increase in judgeships in the first years of the court&#x27;s existence was in part the result of a higher-than-expected workload of the court, and in part the result of legislative changes that broadened the court&#x27;s scope of responsibility. At the same time, the practice of employing assistant judges () had been outlawed.

Only in 1995 did the Federal Court of Justice admit to the failed processing of the Third Reich justice system.

== Location and premises ==

The Federal Court of Justice is housed in five buildings on park-like premises in the centre of Karlsruhe, Herrenstraße 45 a. The main building is the Hereditary Grand Ducal Palace () built in 1891 to 1897 by Josef Durm. During WWII its dome was destroyed and the mansard floor caught fire.

In the 1990s the Federal Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office was separated off of the Federal Court of Justice and housed in a new building in Brauerstrasse.

In October 2003, an extension building was inaugurated. The large library contains the Museum of Legal History ().

In April 2012, a new reception building with large courtroom opened. Up until then the garden had been used as a helicopter landing pad for defendants being flown in.

The Court has two branch offices, such as the Villa Reiss in the Gartenstrasse and a former Bundeswehr barracks in the Rintheimer Strasse, Karlsruhe.

Since July 1997, the 5th Criminal Panel, and since February 2020, the 6th Criminal Panel have been housed at Villa Sack in Leipzig, Karl-Heine-Strasse.

== Judges ==

=== Requirements ===
Judges must meet the personal requirements for lifetime judicial appointments; in particular, they must be German citizens and must have the necessary educational background. Judges of the Federal Court of Justice also have to be 35 years of age or older.

=== Selection and appointment ===

The judges of the Federal Court of Justice are selected by an electoral committee () consisting of the Ministers of Justice of the 16 German and of 16 representatives appointed by the German federal parliament, the . In practice, the usually appoints some of its own members (and occasionally former members) to the committee. Nominations for new judicial appointments can be made by the Federal Minister of Justice or members of the electoral committee. The electoral committee&#x27;s meetings are non-public and the committee&#x27;s vote is done by secret ballot. To be elected, a candidate needs a simple majority of the votes. Elected candidates are appointed by the Federal President of Germany ().

, the Federal Court of Justice has 153 judges. The number of authorised judgeships at the Federal Court of Justice is set by the as part of the annual Federal Budget Act. The federal government has a constitutional duty to ensure the adequate staffing of the Federal Court of Justice and its sister supreme courts.

=== Retirement ===
As judges for life, judges of the Federal Court of Justice must retire upon reaching the retirement age. The retirement age is between 65 and 67 years, depending on the year of birth.

== Organisation ==

=== Divisions of the court ===
The Federal Court of Justice consists of 13 divisions responsible for civil matters () and six divisions responsible for criminal matters (). Each judge of the court is assigned to at least one civil or criminal division, with both civil and criminal divisions presently consisting of approximately eight judges each. Judges can serve on more than one division, in which case their working time is split. Cases are never decided by all the members of a division but, in general, by a panel of five judges ().

In addition, there are eight special divisions (), which have specific responsibilities and are made up of judges from the civil and criminal divisions; some of those divisions also include appointed volunteers with specific expertise relevant to the division&#x27;s specialisation. The lion&#x27;s share of the work is, however, done within the civil and criminal divisions: Of the approximately 10,400 new matters brought before the Court in 2021, about 10,200 fell within the scope of responsibility of a criminal or civil division.

As in all German courts, an annually revised schedule of responsibilities () specifies in detail the allocation of cases to divisions, and each division&#x27;s internal schedule of responsibilities determines the allocation of cases to a five-judge panel. The allocation of cases to divisions is fundamentally different in civil matters than in criminal matters: Each of the civil divisions has specific &quot;subject matter&quot; responsibilities. For instance, civil disputes concerning copyright law are handled by the First Civil Division, while disputes concerning inheritance law are handled by the Fourth. In practice, these responsibilities are rarely changed, which leads to a high degree of specialisation of the individual divisions. Criminal cases, on the other hand, are assigned to a criminal division based primarily on the &quot;origin&quot; of the case, with each division handling the appeals from a certain subset of court districts. For instance, criminal appeals from courts in Berlin are always decided by the Fifth Criminal Division. A few exceptions to this location-based assignment exist; for example, one of the criminal divisions has a special responsibility for road traffic-related criminal matters and another one has exclusive responsibility for national security matters.

Each division of the Federal Court of Justice has a presiding judge. Presiding judges are regular judges of the Federal Court of Justice who are proposed for this additional role by the Federal Minister of Justice and appointed by the Federal President of Germany. A presiding judge&#x27;s vote on a given case carries the same weight as that of any of the associate judges on the panel, but a presiding judge does have some additional influence on the jurisprudence of their division due to the fact that they are a member of every five-judge panel of their division.

=== President and presidium of the court ===

The Federal Court of Justice has a president and a presidium.

The president of the Federal Court of Justice is a regular judge of the court who has been proposed for this additional role by the Federal Minister of Justice and has been so appointed by the Federal President of Germany. The president of the court has a dual role: The president of the court must serve as the presiding judge of at least one civil or criminal division of the court, in addition to being the presiding judge of the Grand Panels, the Joint Panel, and one of the special divisions. At the same time, the president serves in a key administrative role, supervising the other judges of the court, the court&#x27;s academic staff, civil servants, and employees and may also participate in the preparation of legislative projects by issuing opinions.

The following is a list of all presidents of the Federal Court of Justice since the court&#x27;s establishment:

The presidium of the Federal Court of Justice consists of the president and ten other judges of the court. The ten other members of the presidium are elected by all judges of the court. Among other duties, it is the responsibility of the presidium to assign new judges to one or more divisions of the court. Judges can also be reassigned to other divisions by the presidium at the beginning of each calendar year (and, in exceptional circumstances, during the year). In addition, the presidium can appoint a judge as one of the investigating judges of the court.

==Jurisdiction==
=== Role of the court in civil matters ===
The civil divisions of the Federal Court of Justice primarily deal with appeals on points of law () and complaints against denial of leave to appeal on points of law ().

In a typical civil case in Germany, the losing party in the court of first instance can appeal to a court of second instance if the subject matter of the appeal is greater than 600 euros or the court of first instance expressly allowed the appeal. Such an appeal () can be both on points of fact and on points of law, and it prompts the appellate court to re-hear the entire matter (that is, it (re-)hears witnesses, including potential new witnesses, and re-tries material issues of fact).

In some cases, the decision by the appellate court can then be further appealed to the Federal Court of Justice—but this time only on points of law. Examples of such points of law are (alleged) procedural defects or an incorrect understanding of the law that led to the lower court&#x27;s decision. The Federal Court of Justice itself does not receive additional evidence, nor does it hear witnesses, and conducts its review of the lower court&#x27;s decision based on the briefs submitted by counsel, the record of lower court proceedings, and oral argument. In some instances where the five judges of the panel unanimously find that an appeal is inadmissible or has no chance of success, they can dismiss it without oral argument.

In general, bringing a civil case to the Federal Court of Justice requires a grant of leave to appeal by the appellate court. An appellate court is legally required to grant leave if (a) the legal matter is of fundamental significance or if (b) the further development of the law or the interests in ensuring uniform adjudication require a decision to be handed down by the Federal Court of Justice. If leave to appeal is granted, the Federal Court of Justice is bound by this determination of the lower court and has to take the case. Should an injured party feel that the appellate court has wrongly decided not to grant leave to appeal, they can file a with the Federal Court of Justice provided that the subject matter of the appeal is greater than . If the Federal Court of Justice agrees that leave to appeal on a point of law was wrongly denied, it grants leave on its own and subsequently rules on the appeal.

To the extent the appeal on points of law is deemed justified, the Federal Court of Justice reverses the contested judgment and remands the matter (sends it back) to the court of appeal, which decides on it once again. In doing so, the court of appeal must comply with the Federal Court of Justice&#x27;s decision.

=== Role of the court in criminal matters ===
The criminal divisions of the Federal Court of Justice primarily deal with appeals on points of law ().

In Germany, criminal cases involving lesser offenses are decided in the first instance by a district court (), while more serious offenses are initially decided by panels of regional courts () or, in few cases, higher regional courts (). Criminal cases originating in a regional or higher regional court can subsequently be appealed to the Federal Court of Justice on points of law. Unlike in civil cases, no grant of leave is required to appeal.

An appeal can be brought by the defendant or the public prosecutor&#x27;s office. In some trials, the public prosecutor is joined by one or more private accessory prosecutors (), which is a role that can be assumed by the victims of a number of serious offenses such as murder or sexual abuse, or by individuals whose children, parents, siblings, spouses or life partners were killed through an unlawful act. Private accessory prosecutors also have a right to initiate an appeal to the Federal Court of Justice, although their ability to appeal is somewhat more limited.

As in civil matters, appeals on points of law in criminal matters may allege procedural defects or an incorrect understanding of the law that led to the trial court&#x27;s decision, and—again as in civil cases—the Federal Court of Justice itself does not receive additional evidence, nor does it hear witnesses. Instead, it conducts its review of the lower court&#x27;s decision based on the briefs submitted by counsel and the record of lower court proceedings. In some instances where the five judges of the panel unanimously find that a criminal appeal is inadmissible or has no chance of success, they can dismiss it without oral argument. Unlike in civil matters, a panel can also unanimously decide in favour of a defendant without oral argument. In other cases, oral argument is held.

To the extent the appeal on points of law is deemed justified, the Federal Court of Justice vacates the contested judgement and sends the matter back to the regional or higher regional court, respectively. In general, vacating a judgement does not mean setting aside the trial court&#x27;s factual findings. However, the Federal Court of Justice quashes factual findings insofar as they are affected by the violation of law by virtue of which the judgment is vacated. Therefore, a grave procedural defect may lead to an entirely new trial; on the other hand, if a trial court improperly did not find a particular offense on the basis of an incorrect understanding of its legal requirements, the factual findings may be left in place entirely, and the trial court, as the basis for its new judgement, may only have to take additional evidence pertaining to the (previously misunderstood) requirements of said offense. In a minority of cases, the Federal Court of Justice can also decide a case on the merits without sending it back. This can occur, for instance, when a trial court has made a finding about the defendant&#x27;s actions pertaining to an offense committed by someone else and has determined on that basis that the defendant is guilty of aiding the third party in committing the offense; if the Federal Court of Justice later deems the defendant&#x27;s actions—as found by the trial court—insufficient to justify a conviction as an aider, the Federal Court of Justice may acquit the defendant.

=== Investigating judges ===
Two judges of the Federal Court of Justice (plus four judges acting as their deputies) serve as the investigating judges () of the court. In the German criminal law system, investigating judges are responsible for deciding on arrests, provisional placements, seizures, searches, and other measures in relation to a criminal investigation. The jurisdiction of the investigating judges of the Federal Court of Justice is limited to investigations for a small subset of crimes, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, high treason and the formation of terrorist organisations, where the Public Prosecutor General () leads the investigation. The Public Prosecutor General may also take over an investigation of various more ordinary offenses (including murder, manslaughter and abduction) under certain circumstances (for instance where the offence is capable of undermining the continued existence or security of the Federal Republic of Germany) and when it deems the crime to be of &quot;special significance&quot;. In such cases as well, the investigating judges of the Federal Court of Justice have jurisdiction.

=== Special divisions ===
Appeals of decisions in some particular areas of the law are handled by special divisions of the court. The following table lists the special divisions of the Federal Court of Justice.

All judges of the Federal Court of Justice that serve in a special division are regular members of a civil and/or criminal division.

=== Grand Panels and Joint Panel ===
All divisions of the court are at liberty to deviate from their own prior jurisprudence at any time. However, when a panel wishes to deviate from the jurisprudence of one or more other divisions, it must submit a request to those divisions (), asking them whether they stand by their prior decision(s). If any of the divisions do, and if the requesting panel still intends to deviate, it must refer the issue to a Grand Panel. In cases of disagreement between civil divisions, the ultimate arbiter is the Grand Panel for Civil Matters (), a special panel of the court composed of the presiding judges of each of the 13 civil divisions and the president of the court; in cases of disagreement between criminal divisions, the issue is referred to the Grand Panel for Criminal Matters (), which is made up of two representatives from each of the six criminal divisions and the president of the court. If a difference of opinion arises between a criminal and a civil division, the dispute must be resolved by the Joint Grand Panels (), which consists of all the members of the Civil and the Criminal Grand Panel.

If any division of the Federal Court of Justice intends to deviate from a decision by one or more divisions of any other German supreme court (i.e. the Federal Administrative Court, the Federal Fiscal Court, the Federal Labour Court, or the Federal Social Court), it must refer the issue to the Joint Panel (). The Joint Panel is composed of the presidents of all supreme courts (permanent members) and two judges from each of the divisions involved in the disagreement (ad-hoc members).

In practice, the instrument is used only sparsely. In 2021, not a single question was put before the Grand Panel for Criminal Matters (2020: 2). Between 1951 and 2009, only 36 decisions were issued by the Grand Panel for Civil Matters.

== Attorneys ==
In all civil cases heard by the Federal Court of Justice, the parties need to be represented by an attorney who has been specifically admitted to the bar at the Federal Court of Justice (). This admission is the only &#x27;special&#x27; admission within the German court system; ordinarily in Germany, an attorney admitted to the bar may practice before any court. Conversely, within the German court system an attorney at the Federal Court of Justice is only allowed to practice before the Federal Court of Justice, other federal courts of last instance, the Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts of the Federation and the Federal Constitutional Court—but not before any of the lower courts.

Admission to the bar at the Federal Court of Justice is highly selective; as of June 2022, only 38 attorneys are so admitted. Candidates for admission are nominated by an electoral committee (consisting of judges, members of the ordinary bar, and other members of the bar at the Federal Court of Justice) and are then chosen and appointed by the Federal Minister of Justice.

The requirement for a representative specifically admitted to the Federal Court of Justice does not apply in criminal cases. Here, representation by any lawyer admitted to the bar in Germany is sufficient.

== Relation to other courts ==

=== Federal Constitutional Court ===
The Federal Court of Justice, like all German courts of ordinary jurisdiction, is barred from determining that a law or any part of a law violates the German constitution (the Basic Law). If the Federal Court of Justice arrives at the conclusion that a provision is unconstitutional and if the court&#x27;s desired decision of the case depends on that determination, the court must stay the proceedings and must first obtain a decision from the Federal Constitutional Court () on the provision&#x27;s constitutionality.

As is the case with all decisions of ordinary courts in Germany, every decision by the Federal Court of Justice may also itself be the subject of a constitutional complaint () to the Federal Constitutional Court. However, while any party may lodge such a complaint if they feel that a decision by the Federal Court of Justice infringes their constitutional rights, the constitutional complaint has no suspensive effect. Therefore, if, say, a defendant&#x27;s appeal on points of law in a criminal case has been dismissed by the Federal Court of Justice, their conviction will enter into force even if the defendant now asks the Constitutional Court to overturn the Federal Court of Justice&#x27;s decision on constitutional grounds.

=== Court of Justice of the European Union ===
If a decision by the Federal Court of Justice depends on the interpretation of the laws of the European Union, it must stay the proceedings and seek a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) before rendering a final decision in the case. This duty does not arise in situations where the law of the European Union, as interpreted by the CJEU in prior decisions, is sufficiently clear (&quot;acte clair&quot; doctrine).

In 2022, eleven requests for preliminary ruling were submitted by the Federal Court of Justice to the CJEU.

== Style ==
Judgements by the Federal Court of Justice end with the phrase &quot;von Rechts wegen&quot; (&quot;by virtue of the law&quot;). This formula, which had also been used by the and the and whose origins can be traced back to the 14th century, is used only by the Federal Labour Court and the Federal Court of Justice, but no other court in the German judicial system.
