<doc id="551315" wikidata="Q1136718" url="?curid=551315" title="Revanchism">
<text>Revanchism (, from &quot;revanche&quot;, &quot;revenge&quot;) is the political manifestation of the will to reverse the territorial losses which are incurred by a country, frequently after a war or after a social movement. As a term, &quot;revanchism&quot; originated in 1870s France in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War among nationalists who wanted to avenge the French defeat and reclaim the lost territories of Alsace-Lorraine.

Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and is often motivated by economic or geopolitical factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains &quot;unredeemed&quot; outside the borders of its appropriate nation-state.

Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, mobilizing sentiments of ethnic nationalism to claim territories outside of where members of the ethnic group currently live. Such claims are often presented as being based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since &quot;time immemorial&quot;.

==Historical and current examples==
===France===
The instance of revanchism that gave these groundswells of opinion their modern name came in the 1870s. French revanchism was a deep sense of bitterness, hatred and demand for revenge against Germany, especially because of the loss of Alsace and Lorraine following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. Paintings that emphasized the humiliation of the defeat came in high demand, such as those by Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville.

Georges Clemenceau, of the Radical Republicans, opposed participation in the scramble for Africa and other adventures that would divert the Republic from objectives related to the &quot;blue line of the Vosges&quot; in Alsace-Lorraine. After the governments of Jules Ferry had pursued a number of colonies in the early 1880s, Clemenceau lent his support to Georges Ernest Boulanger, a popular figure, nicknamed &quot;Général Revanche&quot;, who it was felt might overthrow the Republic in 1889. This ultranationalist tradition influenced French politics up to 1921 and was one of the major reasons France went to great pains to woo the Russian Empire, resulting in the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1894 and, after more accords, the Triple Entente of the three great Allied powers of World War I: France, Great Britain, and Russia.

French revanchism influenced the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 following the end of World War I, which restored Alsace-Lorraine to France and extracted reparations from the defeated Germany. The conference was not only opened on the anniversary of the proclamation of the German Empire; the treaty also had to be signed by the new German government in the same room, the Hall of Mirrors.

===Germany===

A German revanchist movement developed in response to the losses of World War I. Pan-Germanists within the Weimar Republic called for the reclamation of the property of a German state due to pre-war borders or because of the territory&#x27;s historical relation to Germanic peoples. The movement called for the reincorporation of Alsace-Lorraine, the Polish Corridor and the Sudetenland (see Bohemia, Moravia, Silesiaparts of the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary until its dismemberment after World War I). Those claims, supported by Adolf Hitler, led to World War II, with the invasion of Poland. This irredentism had also been characteristic of the Völkisch movement in general and of the Pan-German League (&quot;Alldeutscher Verband&quot;). The &quot;Verband&quot; wanted to uphold German &quot;racial hygiene&quot; and were against breeding with, in their eyes, inferior races like the Jews and Slavs.

===Greece===

Greek revanchism refers to the political sentiment or movement advocating for the restoration or reclaiming of territories historically or culturally once associated with Greece, but currently under the control of other states. Stemming from unresolved territorial disputes, Greek revanchism often manifests in nationalist rhetoric, diplomatic tensions, and occasional military confrontations. Historical grievances, such as the population exchanges between Greece and Turkey following World War I, also fuel revanchist sentiments. While Greek revanchism has influenced foreign policy decisions and public discourse, it remains a contentious and complex issue in the broader context of regional geopolitics and international relations.

===Poland===
In the 1920s and 1930s, Poland was trying to reclaim ethnic Polish lands that had been seized by German, Russian and Austro-Hungarian empires:
===Sweden===
Sweden lost Finland to Russia at the conclusion of the Finnish War (1808–09), ending nearly 600 years of Swedish rule. For most of the rest of the 1800s there was talk, but few practical plans and little political will, of reclaiming Finland from Russia. Since Sweden was never able to challenge Russia&#x27;s military might on its own, no attempts were made.

During the Crimean War in 1853 to 1856, the Allied nations initiated talks with Sweden to allow troop and fleet movements through Swedish ports to be used against Russia. In return, the Allies would help Sweden reclaim Finland with the help of an expeditionary force. In the end, the plans fell through and Sweden never became involved in the fighting.

===Hungary===

The idea of Greater Hungary is associated with Hungarian revisionist aims at least to regain control over Hungarian-populated areas in Hungary&#x27;s neighbouring countries. The outcome of the Treaty of Trianon of 1920 is to this day remembered in Hungary as the Trianon trauma. According to a study, two-thirds of Hungarians agreed in 2020 that parts of neighbouring countries should belong to them.

===Mexico===

Some Mexican nationalists consider the Southwestern United States to be Mexican territory that must be returned. The territory belonged to Mexico until 1836 when Texas established itself as its own nation. Texas citizens then voted to join the United States in the Texas annexation (1845) leading to the 1846–48 Mexican–American War and, as a consequence of the war, the Mexican Cession of further territory that now constitutes much of the western US.

In 1865, as the American Civil War ended, Maximilian &quot;was actively recruiting Confederate refugees to colonize northern Mexico and bring their slaves with them. Grant foresaw that Maximilian was creating a base from which diehard rebels would carry on a revanchist war against the United States and create an obstacle protecting Maximilian&#x27;s empire against invasion by U.S. forces&quot;.

===Russia===
The annexation of the Crimean peninsula by the Russian Federation in April 2014, together with accusations by Western and Ukrainian leaders that Russia is supporting separatist actions by ethnic Russians in the secessionist Donbas region, has been cited by a number of prominent media outlets in the West as evidence of a revanchist policy on the part of the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has the same origins.

Some Russian nationalists consider Alaska to be Russian territory that must be returned. Alaska was legally sold to the United States by Russia in 1867.

===Argentina===

Argentina considers the British-controlled Falkland Islands to be part of the Tierra del Fuego Province. In 1994, Argentina&#x27;s claim to the territories was added to its constitution.

During the interwar period, the Argentine fascist ideology Nacionalista and organizations such as the Alliance of Nationalist Youth openly supported plans to annex Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and some southern and eastern parts of Bolivia, which they claimed belonged to Argentina via past territories of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata.

===Spain===

Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713. Spain&#x27;s claim to Gibraltar became government policy under the regime of the dictator Francisco Franco and has remained in place under successive governments following the Spanish transition to democracy.

===Iraq===

Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government sought to annex several territories. In the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), Saddam claimed that Iraq had the right to hold sovereignty to the east bank of the Shatt al-Arab river held by Iran.

The Iraqi government, echoing claims made by Iraqi nationalists for years, justified the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 by claiming that Kuwait had always been an integral part of Iraq and only became an independent nation due to the interference of the British government.

It has been suspected that Saddam Hussein intended to invade and annex a portion of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Eastern Province on the justification that the Saudi region of Al-Hasa had been part of the Ottoman province of Basra that the British had helped Saudi Arabia conquer in 1913.

===Turkey===

The 21st century has seen a domestic trend in Turkish politics, where the revival of Ottoman traditions and culture has been accompanied by the rise of the Justice and Development Party (AKP, founded in 2001) which came to power in 2002, along with claims to territory once held by the Ottoman Empire. The use of the ideology by Justice and Development Party has mainly supported a greater influence of Ottoman culture in domestic social policy which has caused issues with the secular and republican credentials of modern Turkey. The AKP have used slogans such as &quot;&quot; (&quot;descendant of the Ottomans&quot;) to refer to their supporters and also their former leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (who was elected President in 2014) during their election campaigns. These domestic ideals have also seen a revival of neo-Ottomanism in the AKP&#x27;s foreign policy. Besides acting as a clear distinction between them and ardent supporters of secularism, the social Ottomanism advocated by the AKP has served as a basis for their efforts to transform Turkey&#x27;s existing parliamentary system into a presidential system, favouring a strong centralised leadership similar to that of the Ottoman era. Critics have thus accused Erdoğan of acting like an &quot;Ottoman sultan&quot;.

The rise in Ottomanism has also been accompanied by claims to territories held by Armenia, with prominent examples including in 2015, a crowd of Turkish youth rallying in Armenian populated districts of Istanbul chanted &quot;We must turn these districts into Armenian and Kurdish cemeteries.&quot; In September 2015, a &#x27;Welcome&#x27; sign was installed in Iğdır and written in four languages, Turkish, Kurdish, English, and Armenian. The Armenian portion of the sign was protested by the &quot;Fight against Armenian groundless allegations” alliance (ASIMDER) who demanded its removal. In October 2015, the Armenian writing on the &#x27;Welcome&#x27; sign was heavily vandalized. The Armenian portion of the sign was ultimately removed in June 2016. The Mayor of Igdir also claimed that the existence of the Armenian state was a &quot;historical mistake&quot;, and that Armenia is actually Turkish territory, illegally occupied by Armenians, waiting to be re-integrated into Turkey.

===Ukraine===
On 24 March 2021, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed the &quot;Decree No. 117/2021&quot; approving the &quot;strategy of de-occupation and reintegration of the temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol&quot;, complementing the activities of the Crimean Platform. On 10 May 2022, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that &quot;In the first months&quot; of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine &quot;the victory for us looked like withdrawal of Russian forces to the positions they occupied before February 24 and payment for inflicted damage. Now if we are strong enough on the military front and we win the battle for Donbas, which will be crucial for the following dynamics of the war, of course the victory for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories&quot;, including Donbas and Crimea.

=== China ===

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) has used historical claims in the South China Sea (SCS) as justification for island building activities and revised territorial claims. The &quot;nine-dash line&quot; map extends the area that the PRC identifies as within its sovereign territory disregarding several international laws of the sea. In addition to civil and military confrontations in the SCS, other territorial disputes have affected Japan, India, and Taiwan. See also Chinese irredentism.

===Philippines===
The Philippines maintains a &quot;dormant claim&quot; on portions of North Borneo as part of its territory, which is currently administered as part of Malaysia&#x27;s Sabah state. The Philippines&#x27; territorial claim is based on the disputed territory being formerly administered by the Sultanate of Sulu under the 1878 Lease Agreement signed between the Sultan of Sulu Jamalul Azam and Baron de Overbeck of North Borneo Chartered Company

<doc id="551330" wikidata="Q14606370" url="?curid=551330" title="List of multiplanetary systems">
<text>From the total of stars known to have exoplanets (as of ), there are a total of known multiplanetary systems, or stars with at least two confirmed planets, beyond the Solar System. This list includes systems with at least three confirmed planets or two confirmed planets where additional candidates have been proposed. The stars with the most confirmed planets are the Sun (the Solar System&#x27;s star) and Kepler-90, with 8 confirmed planets each, followed by TRAPPIST-1 with 7 planets.

The multiplanetary systems are listed below according to the star&#x27;s distance from Earth. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Solar System, has three planets (b, c and d). The nearest system with four or more confirmed planets is Gliese 876, with four known. The farthest confirmed multiplanetary system is OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L, at away.

The table below contains information about the coordinates, spectral and physical properties, and the number of confirmed (unconfirmed) planets for systems with at least 2 planets and 1 not confirmed. The two most important stellar properties are mass and metallicity because they determine how these planetary systems form. Systems with higher mass and metallicity tend to have more planets and more massive planets. However, although low metallicity stars tend to have fewer massive planets, particularly hot-Jupiters, they also tend to have a larger number of close-in planets, orbiting at less than 1 AU.

<text>Matthias Bernard Braun (Czech: &quot;Matyáš Bernard Braun&quot;, 24 February 1684 in Sautens near Innsbruck – 15 February 1738 in Prague) was a sculptor and carver active in the Kingdom of Bohemia, one of the most prominent late baroque style sculptors in the area.

Matthias Bernard Braun was born as the fifth child of Jacob Braun and Magdalene born Neureuter. He apprenticed in the Holy Roman Empire where he was born in Salzburg, in the Reoublic of Venice, and in the Papal States in Bologna and Rome. In his work, it is the Italian influence, that is the most prominent. He was inspired by Michelangelo Buonarroti, Gian Lorenzo Bernini and by the Venetian sculptural school of the 17th century and thus became a great propagator of the Italian-provenience sculpture in the Central-European context.

Some time before 1710, Braun came to visit Prague (also in the Holy Roman Empire), already as a full-fledged artist creating from sandstone, and soon he became domestic in Bohemia. He found his wife and friends there, and became a citizen to the New Town of Prague. Already his first work - the statuary of the Vision of St. Luthgard (Czech: &quot;Vidění sv. Luitgardy&quot;) from 1710, situated on harles Bridge in Prague - brought to him much attention and many new orders. Braun then was able to found the biggest workshop in Prague, employing six journeymen and having an income of 900 golden a year around 1725. Soon, he himself could not manage the number of new commissions for Prague palaces, gardens, churches and many other places in Bohemia, a situation worsened by the progressing tuberculosis. That is why he only created the designs and models, had his cooperators realize them and completed the work into the final appearance. He had five children, none of which continued his work, though. He died in Prague in 1738.

Matthias Braun is probably the most famous for his collection of the &quot;allegories of Virtues and Vices&quot; situated at the Kuks Hospital in Bohemia, a commission of count František Antonín Špork. Other notable sculptures include: the &quot;Bethlehem&quot; - monumental statues chiselled directly in sandstone rocks near Kuks, forty pitoresque statues of dwarfs at the Kuks race-course, several statuaries at Charles Bridge in Prague, statues in St. Kliment&#x27;s Church in Prague, the stone pillar of the Holy Trinity in Teplice, the sculptures in the interior of Czernin palace (Prague), and many others.

There is an asteroid named Mathiasbraun (number 6768), discovered in 1983.

<doc id="551336" wikidata="Q1124859" url="?curid=551336" title="Oberon-class submarine">
<text>The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was a ship class of 27 British-designed submarines operated by five nations. They were designed as a follow-on from the &quot;Porpoise&quot; class; physical dimensions were the same but stronger materials were used in hull construction and improved equipment was fitted.

The &quot;Oberon&quot;s operated during the Cold War, with duties including surveillance, tracking of other ships and submarines, delivery and retrieval of special forces personnel and serving as targets for anti-submarine training. Submarines of the class were in service until 2000.

The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was arguably the best conventional submarine class of its time, with a reputation for remarkable quietness. The quietness of the &quot;Oberon&quot; vessels enabled them to operate into the late 20th century until replaced by newer classes such as the &quot;Collins&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot; classes in Australia and Canada, respectively.

The submarines were built between 1957 and 1978 by four shipyards: Cammell Laird (4), Chatham Dockyard (6), Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company (11) and Vickers-Armstrongs (6). Thirteen of the submarines were operated by the Royal Navy, six by the Royal Australian Navy, three by the Brazilian Navy, three by the Royal Canadian Navy/Canadian Forces Maritime Command (plus two ex-Royal Navy boats later acquired for non-commissioned roles), and two by the Chilean Navy.

==Design and construction==
The -long &quot;Oberon&quot; class was based on the preceding &quot;Porpoise&quot; class of submarines, which were in service from 1956 to 1988. Changes from the &quot;Porpoise&quot; design were primarily to improve the strength and stealth of the submarine. Instead of UXW steel, the hull was built from QT28 steel, which was easier to fabricate and stronger, allowing the submarine to dive deeper. Glass-reinforced plastic was used in construction of the casing.
Electronics, sonar, and radar systems were also upgraded to the latest standard. The submarines were equipped with a type 1002 surface search and navigation radar, a type 187 active-passive attack sonar, and a type 2007 long-range passive sonar. The &quot;Oberon&quot;s were constructed at a variety of shipyards in the United Kingdom: the six Australian and two Chilean submarines by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company (the latter were built after the Scott Lithgow merger); the three Brazilian submarines by Vickers-Armstrongs; and the three Canadian submarines at Chatham Dockyard. Construction of the British submarines was shared amongst four dockyards: the three mentioned above and Cammell Laird.

===Armament===

The &quot;Oberon&quot;s were originally armed with eight torpedo tubes: six tubes in the bow, and two short tubes for antisubmarine defence in the stern. The submarine normally carried a payload of 20 torpedoes for the forward tubes; a mix of Mark 24 Tigerfish and Mark 8 torpedoes, while only the two preloaded Mark 20S torpedoes were carried for the stern tubes. Naval mines could be carried instead of torpedoes: the torpedo payload would be replaced with up to 50 Mark 5 Stonefish or Mark 6 Sea Urchin mines.

The forward torpedo tubes are constructed in two sections bolted together across the bulkhead at the fore end of the torpedo compartment. The long inner section is constructed of rolled steel fitted with welded flanges and support brackets. The outer section is constructed of a similar tube long but with a reinforced thick section behind the main bulkhead. The internal door hinges at one side with two locking mechanisms, a swing bolt opposite the hinge and a rotating locking ring attached to the tube which presses down on the ten projecting lugs around the door. The outer end of the tube is sealed with a domed bow cap. Bow shutters close across the bow caps so as to preserve the streamlined shape of the bow when the cap is closed.
The bow caps and shutters are mechanically linked to a hydraulically operated drive rod from within the torpedo compartment. The bow cap opens first behind the shutter, which then folds back against it forming a smooth exit tube. Interlocks prevent the doors at both ends being opened at the same time but the inner door is also provided with a test cock to check whether the tube is full of water before opening and remains held nearly closed by the swing bolt after the locking ring is released. The tube internal diameter is 22.5 in, wider than the torpedo, which is designed as a loose fit inside the tube. Torpedoes could be fired either electrically or with compressed air.

The aft torpedo tubes passed through the ballast tank at the rear of the submarine. A section projected into the boat through the bulkhead, forming overall a relatively short tube of , but of diameter.

With the retirement of the Mark 20S torpedo in the 1980s, the stern torpedo tubes were decommissioned and the torpedo ballast tanks were thereafter used for storing beer.

===Propulsion systems===
The class used diesel-electric propulsion, with lead-acid batteries to provide power when the engines cannot be used. Each vessel has two Admiralty-pattern V-16 diesel engines (ASR1 16VMS), each driving one 1280-kW 880-V generator. These can provide power directly to the two electric motors, one directly connected to each propeller, or for charging batteries. The diesel engines can only be operated with external ventilation, but this can be obtained either while on the surface or when shallowly submerged by use of two snorkels which can be raised from the fin. One snorkel brings in new air to the boat, while the other takes exhaust fumes from the engines. The ventilation system is designed so the fresh air spreads through the boat.
The generators are cooled by an internal fan on the shaft which circulates air through a filter and water-cooled heat exchanger within the casing. A grill allows pressure equalisation inside and out. The generator has one pedestal bearing fed with oil from the diesel engine lubrication supply and is fitted with an internal heater to prevent condensation when not running.

The submarine has two batteries, each comprising 224 2V cells (type D7420) giving a nominal 440 V output. One battery is located underneath the crew accommodation compartment, and the other under the control compartment. Each battery has a switch circuit in the middle so it can be split into two banks of 112 cells. The cells are designed to deliver 7420 Ah at the five hour discharge rate. All steelwork within the battery compartments is lined with rubber to protect the metal from attack by acid, and also all conducting material is insulated to prevent risks of electric shock. Waxed timber is used to make framing and crawlways to access the batteries and support them because of its resistance to acid. The battery compartment has a sump to collect any spilled liquids. Each cell weighs and contains 18.5 gallons of electrolyte. Cells are held tightly in place with wooden wedges to prevent movement with the boat. Each cell has four connector bolts to each electrode and an agitator pipe which bubbles air through the cell to ensure the electrolyte remains mixed and uniform. Cooling water is fed through pipes attached to the electrode connectors to prevent overheating and the battery temperature is monitored.

In operation, each battery is charged until the voltage reaches 560 V, then allowed a further hour&#x27;s charging. Fortnightly, it should be allowed 5 hours&#x27; charging after reaching 560 V to ensure a maximum charge is reached. Every two months, the battery should be given an equalising charge of eight hours to ensure all cells have reached their maximum. The battery is designed to operate with a specific gravity of the electrolyte between 1.080 and 1.280. Initial charging current should be around 1650 amps for s.g. below 1.180, 1250 A above 1.180, falling to 280 A when charging is complete. At a voltage around 538 V, the cells begin to give off explosive hydrogen gas, so the applied power is reduced during charging to keep voltage below this value until current falls to 280 A, which is then maintained while voltage is allowed to rise until the requisite voltage and charge time are reached. In an emergency, the charging current can be raised to 2000 A. To maintain overall capacity, batteries need to be completely discharged over a five-hour period once every four months and then completely recharged. The battery compartments are sealed to prevent gases escaping into the submarine, or salt water entering, which inside a battery would cause the release of poisonous chlorine gas. Ventilation fans are used to extract hydrogen released by the cells and catalytic converters are placed strategically through the submarine to remove hydrogen from the air by recombining it with oxygen to form water.
Each of the two propellers on the submarine is connected to a 3000 bhp DC electric motor. Each motor is designed with two separate armatures, in effect two motors in the same unit. Speed of the submarine can be varied by connecting the batteries and armatures in different series and parallel combinations. Slowest speed is obtained by connecting both batteries in parallel, thus supplying 440 V, across all four motor armatures in series, thus applying 110 V to each (&#x27;shafts in series&#x27;). Next, the batteries in parallel may be applied across the two motors in parallel, with their armatures in series (&#x27;group down&#x27;). This applies 220 V across each armature. Third, both batteries are applied in parallel across all four armatures applying 440 V to each (&#x27;group up&#x27;). Finally, the batteries can be arranged in series so as to apply 880 V across all four armatures in parallel (&#x27;batteries in series&#x27;). Each armature also has an associated field winding which is separately supplied with current which may be varied resistively, providing further speed control (maximum 35 A).

The motors are designed with a sealed oil sump from which oil is pumped continuously to lubricate the bearings. A fan draws air from the engine room through the motor to cool it and returns the exhaust air to the engine room through a water-cooled heat exchanger. This arrangement reduces the possibility of water being drawn into the motor should there be a leak in the cooler. The motor is also fitted with a heater to keep it warm when not running so as to prevent condensation internally. Temperature and revolution speed are monitored and displayed on the control panel.

===Auxiliary power===

The batteries provide variable DC power (VP), which ranges in normal usage from 390 to 650 V. Pumps for ballast, water, air compressors, ventilation, cooling, and hydraulics are all designed to cope with this supply range, but some equipment cannot. The boat, therefore, is supplied with two sets of auxiliary motor generators designed to be powered by the batteries and produce stable output, one set powered by each main battery. A 220 V DC supply (CP) is provided by two generators, one supplied from each battery with either being sufficient by itself. Two 60 Hz three-phase alternators provide power for equipment designed to work off 115 or 230 V AC and two more 15 kW 400 Hz generators provide power at 205 V AC used by radar, sonar, fire control, and communications electronics. Two generators plus an additional backup battery provide 24 V DC.

In the event of damage to the main electrical distribution system, provision is made for one of the CP generators to be connected directly to one armature of the port motor, to provide some propulsion by alternative circuitry.

===Regional variations===

;Australia
:The Royal Australian Navy acquired six &quot;Oberon&quot;s: an initial order of four and a second order of two. The second order was originally for four submarines, but two were cancelled in favour of expanding the RAN Fleet Air Arm.
:Australian &quot;Oberon&quot;s had different electronic equipment, using primarily American radar and sonar systems. They had Sperry BQG-4 Micropuffs passive ranging sonar and Krupp CSU3-41 attack sonar. Instead of the British Tigerfish torpedoes, the Australians used American Mark 48 torpedoes. They had a slightly larger payload, carrying 22 torpedoes for the forward tubes, six of which were preloaded. Shortly after entering service, the aft torpedo tubes in all six submarines were sealed.
:The Australian submarines were later updated to be equipped with the subsonic antiship Harpoon missile. In 1985, off the island of Kauai in Hawaii, HMAS &quot;Ovens&quot; became only the second conventional submarine in the world—and the first &quot;Oberon&quot;—to fire a subsurface-launched Harpoon missile, successfully hitting the target over the horizon. Consequently, the designation for the Australian &quot;Oberon&quot;s changed from SS to SSG.

;Brazil
:The main differences between the Brazilian and British &quot;Oberon&quot;s was the fire-control systems, with a Vickers system being fitted to the Brazilian boats. The three Brazilian submarines were later upgraded to use the more advanced Mod 1 Tigerfish torpedo.

;Canada
:The three Canadian submarines were built with improved air-conditioning systems, while as many common components as possible were replaced with Canadian equivalents. The Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s used United States Navy torpedoes throughout their career: they were initially equipped with Mark 37 torpedoes, but were later upgraded for the Mark 48s.

;Chile
:Chilean submarines were identical to their British counterparts except for carrying German SUT torpedoes.

==Service==
===British service===
The first of the class to be commissioned into the Royal Navy was in 1960, followed by the name vessel in 1961. The last to be commissioned was in 1967. Six were commissioned between 1967 and 1978 for the RAN. In 1982, &quot;Onyx&quot; took part in the Falklands War, the only conventional submarine of the RN to do so, landing members of the SBS. She was escorted back to UK at 5 kn after hitting an undetected submerged reef which damaged two of its torpedo tubes, trapping a Tigerfish torpedo. It was removed back at Portsmouth.

All &quot;Oberon&quot;s in service, including boats exported, have now been decommissioned; the last RN boats were decommissioned in 1993, with the final Canadian and Australian &quot;Oberon&quot;s decommissioned in 2000.

===Canadian acquisition===

Beginning in 1957, Canada began looking at acquiring submarines to replace the training 6th Submarine Division provided by the Royal Navy at Halifax, Nova Scotia. A proposal was submitted to the Canadian Chiefs of Staff in November 1959 affirming the need for a Canadian submarine service and to incorporate the acquisition of the subs into the fleet renewal plan of the late 1950s. The subs would be part of Canada&#x27;s effort to rectify the problem of block obsolescence in its surface fleet. In 1960 two options were presented to the Canadian government, the first suggesting the acquisition of expensive s and the second proposing the purchase of six cheaper &quot;Oberon&quot;s as part of a larger package of vessels. In March 1962, Cabinet recommended the purchase of three &quot;Oberon&quot;s and eight frigates, on the condition that the cost of acquiring the submarines from the United Kingdom would be offset by British defence purchases in Canada. It was also supplement by Balao-class submarine trainer HMCS Grilse S-71 (former USS Burrfish SS-312) beginning in 1961. On 11 April 1962, the purchase was announced in the House of Commons of Canada by the Minister of National Defence, Douglas Harkness.

However, the Conservative government postponed the acquisition of the &quot;Oberon&quot;s due to the slow speed of the United Kingdom&#x27;s attempt to offset the acquisition. The Conservative government was defeated in 1963 and the incoming Liberal government suspended all major defence procurement projects upon taking power. The United Kingdom, in an effort to get the contract moving, offered the hulls of &quot;Ocelot&quot; and &quot;Opportune&quot;, but Canada passed on them. However, when &quot;Onyx&quot; became available, Canada took up the offer. The final price of $40 million for the entire contract was agreed upon in 1963.

Since &quot;Onyx&quot; was already under construction, the boat was finished to Royal Navy specifications. All three boats received modifications to the original &quot;Oberon&quot; design, which included the enlargement of the snort de-icer, a different weapons fit, a larger air conditioning unit, active sonar and different communications equipment. The second and third hulls were built to Canadian specifications, which moved the galley forward of the control room to make room for the sonar equipment. This led to the removal of three crew bunks, a problem that was never rectified in the submarines and led to an accommodation issue for the crew.

The first submarine was scheduled to be delivered in 1965, with the following two in 1967 and 1968, respectively. The three boats were given First Nations names; &quot;Onyx&quot; being renamed &quot;Ojibwa&quot;, &quot;Onondaga&quot; and &quot;Okanagan&quot;. They entered service on 23 September 1965, 22 June 1967 and 22 June 1968 respectively for service as &quot;clockwork mice&quot;, submarines used to train surface vessels in anti-submarine warfare.

Two further &quot;Oberon&quot;s were acquired but never commissioned into the Canadian Navy. In 1989, &quot;Olympus&quot; was acquired as a stationary training vessel at Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1992 &quot;Osiris&quot; was acquired for cannibalisation in a spare parts program between the UK and Canada. The submarine never sailed and was taken apart in the UK to arrive in Canada in 22,050 pieces in 1993.

====Submarine Operational Update Program (SOUP)====
By the late 1970s, the &quot;Oberon&quot;s in Canadian service had become obsolete and were in need of an update. Planning was done in 1978 and the program approved in February 1979. In an effort to take the subs from anti-submarine warfare training to frontline service, Maritime Command developed a refit program that included new sonars, periscopes, communications and fire-control systems. They also had their armament upgraded with the fitting of torpedo tubes capable of firing the Mk 48 torpedo. This would allow the submarines to be deployed by NATO in the North Atlantic to monitor Soviet submarines.

By 1975, the fire control system aboard the Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s was obsolete. Spare parts from the UK were becoming rarer. The Submarine Operational Update Program (SOUP) was developed to deal with the operational capability of the submarines along with a Logistic Support Agreement (LSA) to acquire more spare parts. The SOUP refits were performed during the submarines&#x27; mid-life refits. The LSA was finalised in 1989, with the acquisition of &quot;Olympus&quot; as a training vessel. However, the LSA was deemed insufficient by 1992 and the Canadian government acquired &quot;Osiris&quot; for cannibalisation.

The SOUP refits comprised a new US fire control system, a digital Singer Librascope Mark I, and new Sperry passive ranging sonar with the Type 719 short range sonar removed. The new sonar was placed in the upper casing on the pressure hull. New communications and navigational systems were installed. The submarines were fitted with new torpedo tubes for Mk 48 torpedoes; however, the torpedoes themselves were considered a separate procurement program, which was only finalised in 1985.

Between 1980 and 1986, one of the Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s was out of service undergoing the refit. SOUP came in on time and on its budget of $45 million in 1986. SOUP kept the Canadian &quot;Oberon&quot;s until the end of the 1990s when they were replaced by the British s.

===Chilean service===
The Chilean government required two &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines to be built by Scott&#x27;s Shipbuilders Engineering Co., Ltd. The first was built in 1971 and launched on 22 December 1972 and given the name &quot;O&#x27;Brien&quot;, arriving at Punta Arenas on 10 August 1976. The second submarine, built in 1972, launched on 26 September 1973, was given the name &quot;Hyatt&quot;. The submarine arrived at Punta Arenas on 10 February 1977. These two submarines were able to achieve a speed of 12 knots surfaced and 17 knots submerged. With a length of 90 meters and a displacement of 2,030 tons surfaced and 2,410 tons submerged, the submarines had a 6,000 bhp engine to power them. The submarines were fitted with eight 21-inch torpedo tubes. Both submarines remained in service until 31 December 2001 where they were replaced by Scorpène-class submarines.


===Australian service===
Australian &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines were reported to have regularly conducted operations with special forces, although due to their limited capability these were restricted to circumstances where the boat could surface, and were usually conducted at night. This included placing divers under the casing for further covert movement, or disembarking special forces teams using kayaks or inflatable boats.

==Fates==

As of 2015, eight of the submarines are preserved intact as museum vessels, another three are partially preserved (with some exterior portions of the submarine on display) and one is in private ownership and awaiting conversion for display. The rest have been sold for scrap, including one former museum vessel.

Two of the ex-Royal Navy submarines were preserved in the UK but only one remains. HMS &quot;Onyx&quot; was moved to Barrow-in-Furness after the museum at Birkenhead, Merseyside closed but was later towed to Gareloch in Scotland where she was broken for scrap in 2014 after failed attempts to turn her into a museum. The other boat, , is located at Chatham. is harboured in Sassnitz, Germany on the island of Rügen and can be visited. Another two British &quot;Oberon&quot;s were transferred to Canada: as a non-commissioned training vessel, and for spare parts. The other British submarines were disposed of.

Australia&#x27;s six &quot;Oberon&quot;s have been preserved and are on display, either completely or partially. is located at the Western Australian Maritime Museum at Fremantle, while is located at the Australian National Maritime Museum in Darling Harbour, Sydney. The fin, outer hull, and stern section of are preserved on land at Holbrook, New South Wales. is located off Crib Point in Westernport Bay, Victoria, where she has been awaiting conversion into a museum vessel since 2002; a lack of funding and co-operation from local and state governments means that the volunteer group hoping to preserve &quot;Otama&quot; attempted to sell the submarine on eBay but to no avail. &#x27;s fin stands as a permanent memorial at , Garden Island, Western Australia; while &#x27;s bow is next to at the Western Australian Maritime Museum. &#x27;s fin stands as a permanent memorial at Rockingham Naval Memorial Park in Western Australia.
In 2005, it was announced that the four surviving Canadian submarines (minus &quot;Osiris&quot;, which was scrapped in 1992 after being stripped for parts) were to be sold for scrapping, as they had deteriorated beyond the point of use. was purchased for C$4 plus tax by the Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-Père for use as a museum vessel, and was towed from Halifax to Pointe-au-Père, Quebec in July 2008. In July 2011, &quot;Olympus&quot; was towed to a scrapyard in Port Maitland, Ontario, with to be delivered to the same scrapyard in August 2011. has been preserved as part of the Elgin Military Museum. She was moved to Port Burwell, Ontario in November 2012, and will become a focal point of a new Museum of Naval History. &quot;Ojibwa&quot; opened for public tours in July 2013.
One of the Brazilian &quot;Oberon&quot;s (&quot;Tonelero&quot;) sank while docked at the navy yards at the Praça Mauá on Rio de Janeiro, on 24 December 2000. The surviving Brazilian &quot;Oberon&quot;, &quot;Riachuelo&quot;, was converted into a museum at the Brazilian Navy Cultural Center (&quot;Espaço Cultural da Marinha Brasileira&quot;) in Rio de Janeiro.

The Chilean Navy sold to the city of Valdivia in 2002, to be converted into the first submarine museum of Chile. The submarine went through a series of modifications in the ASMAR shipyards during that year, and as of December 2017, is on display at the end of Avenida Costanera Arturo Prat, in front of the Corte de Apelaciones building.

===Successors===
The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was briefly succeeded in RN service by the &quot;Upholder&quot;-class submarine. The &quot;Upholder&quot;-class submarines were later upgraded and sold to Canada for service in the Royal Canadian Navy after refit as the &quot;Victoria&quot; class, again replacing &quot;Oberon&quot;s.

The Australian &quot;Oberon&quot;s were replaced by the six s.

The two Chilean &quot;Oberon&quot;s were replaced by the s &quot;O&#x27;Higgins&quot; and &quot;Carrera&quot;.

The Brazilian &quot;Oberon&quot;s were replaced by Type 209 submarines.

<doc id="551340" wikidata="Q567869" url="?curid=551340" title="Anosognosia">
<text>Anosognosia is a condition in which a person with a disability is cognitively unaware of having it due to an underlying physical condition. Anosognosia results from physiological damage to brain structures, typically to the parietal lobe or a diffuse lesion on the fronto-temporal-parietal area in the right hemisphere, and is thus a neuropsychiatric disorder. A deficit of self-awareness, the term was first coined by the neurologist Joseph Babinski in 1914, in order to describe the unawareness of hemiplegia.

Phenomenologically, anosognosia has similarities to denial, which is a psychological defense mechanism; attempts have been made at a unified explanation.

The name derives from Ancient Greek: ἀ-, &quot;a-&quot; (&#x27;without&#x27;), νόσος, &quot;nosos (&quot;&#x27;disease&#x27;), and γνῶσις, &quot;gnōsis&quot; (&#x27;knowledge&#x27;). It is considered a disorder that makes the treatment of the patient more difficult, since it may affect negatively the therapeutic relationship. Anosognosia is sometimes accompanied by asomatognosia, a form of neglect in which patients deny ownership of body parts such as their limbs.

==Causes==
Relatively little has been discovered about the cause of the condition since its initial identification. Recent empirical studies tend to consider anosognosia a multi-componential syndrome or multi-faceted phenomenon. That is, it can be manifested by failure to be aware of a number of specific deficits, including motor (hemiplegia), sensory (hemianaesthesia, hemianopia), spatial (unilateral neglect), memory (dementia), and language (receptive aphasia) due to impairment of anatomo-functionally discrete monitoring systems.

Anosognosia is relatively common following different causes of brain injury, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury; for example, anosognosia for hemiparesis (weakness of one side of the body) with onset of acute stroke is estimated at between 10% and 18%. However, it can appear to occur in conjunction with virtually any neurological impairment. It is more frequent in the acute than in the chronic phase and more prominent for assessment in the cases with right hemispheric lesions than with the left.

The condition does not seem to be directly related to sensory loss but is thought to be caused by damage to higher level neurocognitive processes that are involved in integrating sensory information with processes that support spatial or bodily representations (including the somatosensory system). Anosognosia is thought to be related to unilateral neglect, a condition often found after damage to the non-dominant (usually the right) hemisphere of the cerebral cortex in which people seem unable to attend to, or sometimes comprehend, anything on a certain side of their body (usually the left).

Anosognosia can be selective in that an affected person with multiple impairments may seem unaware of only one handicap, while appearing to be fully aware of any others. This is consistent with the idea that the source of the problem relates to spatial representation of the body. For example, anosognosia for hemiplegia may occur with or without intact awareness of visuo-spatial unilateral neglect. This phenomenon of double dissociation can be an indicator of domain-specific disorders of awareness modules, meaning that in anosognosia, brain damage can selectively impact the self-monitoring process of one specific physical or cognitive function rather than a spatial location of the body.

There are also studies showing that the maneuver of vestibular stimulation could temporarily improve both the syndrome of spatial unilateral neglect and of anosognosia for left hemiplegia. Combining the findings of hemispheric asymmetry to the right, association with spatial unilateral neglect, and the temporal improvement on both syndromes, it is suggested there can be a spatial component underlying the mechanism of anosognosia for motor weakness and that neural processes could be modulated similarly. There were some cases of anosognosia for right hemiplegia after left hemisphere damage, but the frequency of this type of anosognosia has not been estimated.

Anosognosia may occur as part of receptive aphasia, a language disorder that causes poor comprehension of speech and the production of fluent but incomprehensible sentences. A patient with receptive aphasia cannot correct their own phonetics errors and shows &quot;anger and disappointment with the person with whom s/he is speaking because that person fails to understand her/him&quot;. This may be a result of brain damage to the posterior portion of the superior temporal gyrus, believed to contain representations of word sounds. With those representations significantly distorted, patients with receptive aphasia are unable to monitor their mistakes. Other patients with receptive aphasia are fully aware of their condition and speech inhibitions, but cannot monitor their condition, which is not the same as anosognosia and therefore cannot explain the occurrence of neologistic jargon.

==Psychiatry==

Although largely used to describe unawareness of impairment after brain injury or stroke, the term &quot;anosognosia&quot; is occasionally used to describe the lack of insight shown by some people with anorexia nervosa. They do not seem to recognize that they have a mental illness. There is evidence that anosognosia related to schizophrenia may be the result of frontal lobe damage.

==Diagnosis==
Clinically, anosognosia is often assessed by giving patients an anosognosia questionnaire in order to assess their metacognitive knowledge of deficits. However, neither of the existing questionnaires applied in the clinics are designed thoroughly for evaluating the multidimensional nature of this clinical phenomenon; nor are the responses obtained via offline questionnaire capable of revealing the discrepancy of awareness observed from their online task performance. The discrepancy is noticed when patients showed no awareness of their deficits from the offline responses to the questionnaire but demonstrated reluctance or verbal circumlocution when asked to perform an online task. For example, patients with anosognosia for hemiplegia may find excuses not to perform a bimanual task even though they do not admit it is because of their paralyzed arms.

A similar situation can happen to patients with anosognosia for cognitive deficits after traumatic brain injury when monitoring their errors during the tasks regarding their memory and attention (online emergent awareness) and when predicting their performance right before the same tasks (online anticipatory awareness). It can also occur among patients with dementia and anosognosia for memory deficit when prompted with dementia-related words, showing possible pre-attentive processing and implicit knowledge of their memory problems. Patients with anosognosia may also overestimate their performance when asked in first-person formed questions but not from a third-person perspective when the questions referring to others.

When assessing the causes of anosognosia within stroke patients, CT scans have been used to assess where the greatest amount of damage is found within the various areas of the brain. Stroke patients with mild and severe levels of anosognosia (determined by response to an anosognosia questionnaire) have been linked to lesions within the temporoparietal and thalamic regions, when compared to those who experience moderate anosognosia, or none at all. In contrast, after a stroke, people with moderate anosognosia have a higher frequency of lesions involving the basal ganglia, compared to those with mild or severe anosognosia.

==Treatment==
In regard to anosognosia for neurological patients, no long-term treatments exist. As with unilateral neglect, caloric reflex testing (squirting ice cold water into the left ear) is known to temporarily ameliorate unawareness of impairment. It is not entirely clear how this works, although it is thought that the unconscious shift of attention or focus caused by the intense stimulation of the vestibular system temporarily influences awareness. Most cases of anosognosia appear to simply disappear over time, while other cases can last indefinitely. Normally, long-term cases are treated with cognitive therapy to train patients to adjust for their inoperable limbs (though it is believed that these patients still are not &quot;aware&quot; of their disability). Another commonly used method is the use of feedback — comparing clients&#x27; self-predicted performance with their actual performance on a task in an attempt to improve insight.

Neurorehabilitation is difficult because, as anosognosia impairs the patient&#x27;s desire to seek medical aid, it may also impair their ability to seek rehabilitation. A lack of awareness of the deficit makes cooperative, mindful work with a therapist difficult. In the acute phase, very little can be done to improve their awareness, but during this time, it is important for the therapist to build a therapeutic alliance with patients by entering their phenomenological field and reducing their frustration and confusion. Since severity changes over time, no single method of treatment or rehabilitation has emerged or will likely emerge.

<doc id="551350" wikidata="Q4025075" url="?curid=551350" title="Zé Arigó">
<text>Zé Arigó (pseudonym of José Pedro de Freitas 18 October 1921 – 11 January 1971) was a faith healer and proponent of psychic surgery. He claimed to have performed psychic surgery with his hands or with simple kitchen utensils while in a mediumistic trance, therefore he was also known as the Surgeon of the Rusty Knife. During his operations he supposedly embodied the spirit of Dr. Adolf Fritz.

==Biography==
Zé Arigó was born José Pedro de Freitas on a farm located 6 kilometers from Congonhas do Campo, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. His family was very poor and he could only study up to the third grade of school. At the age of 14 he began working at a mine where he worked for 6 years. According to his autobiography, around 1950 he began to suffer from strong headaches, insomnia, trances, and hallucinations. One day he felt that the voice that had been pursuing him took over his body, and he had a vision of a bald man, dressed in a white apron and supervising a team of doctors and nurses in an enormous operating room. This entity identified itself as &quot;Dr. Fritz.&quot;

After claiming to have channeled Dr. Fritz, Arigó began to perform operations using scalpels and needles. His reputation soared and spread throughout Brazil after it was alleged that he had removed a cancerous tumor from the lung of a well-known Brazilian senator. Over the next twenty years, thousands of people who mistrusted traditional medicine, or had not found help in it, came to Congonhas in search of a cure.

In 1956 Arigó was convicted of illegally practicing medicine. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison, but was pardoned by President of Brazil Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira. In 1962 he was arrested and held for seven months for practicing medicine without a license. However, he was allowed to continue treating people while held in jail. Arigó died in 1971 in an automobile accident.

==Critical reception==
Óscar González-Quevedo, a prominent Catholic critic of Brazilian Spiritism, published a follow-up survey of Arigó&#x27;s clients in 1973. He reported that of 836 clients surveyed, three claimed a full cure, 15.5% improved, 55.5% had no long-term change, 25.1% had no response, and 3.9% self-reported injuries. González-Quevedo&#x27;s website also accuses Arigó of having mistaken albinism for leprosy, and of having misdiagnosed a benign tumor as cancerous. He suspects Arigó of obtaining the names of medicines from conversations with doctors, and of obtaining medical conditions from his day job, where he worked with the personal files of pensioners and retirees.

Magician and skeptic James Randi considered the psychic surgery of Arigó to be the result of sleight of hand trickery. In his best-known book &quot;Flim-Flam!&quot; Randi published a photograph of himself performing a knife stunt that Arigó was alleged to have performed.

Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell has written that Arigó &quot;prescribed various potions and concoctions that obviously depended for their effectiveness on the placebo effect. His prescriptions were filled at the only pharmacy in town run by the amateur doctor&#x27;s brother. By such means were Arigo&#x27;s alleged &#x27;miracle healings&#x27; actually performed.&quot;

Martin Gardner withdrew his book in protest to its publisher, Crowell-Collier, publishing John G. Fuller&#x27;s book &quot;Arigo&quot;.

Alan Arkin writes of the influence his knowledge of Arigó had on a specific time in his life in his book, &quot;Out Of My Mind:(Not Quite a Memoir).&quot;

<doc id="551356" wikidata="Q835381" url="?curid=551356" title="List of statues on Charles Bridge">
<text>There are 30 statues mounted to the balustrade of [[Charles Bridge]] in Prague. They form two rows, one on each side. For the purpose of this article, they are listed in the order they are passed when crossing the bridge from the Old Town to the Lesser Quarter, and are divided into two categories: those on the north side of the bridge and those on the south side. The statue of Bruncvík is also included, although it is not considered one of the principal statues.

Damage caused to the statues over many years has resulted in many of the originals being replaced by copies.

==Statues on the south side of the bridge==
=== Statue of St. Ivo ===
(&quot;sousoší sv. Iva&quot; or &quot;Ivona&quot;) The original was made by Matthias Braun in 1711, paid for by the Law faculty of Charles University. The statue portrays St. Ivo as the patron saint of lawyers, accompanied by an allegorical depiction of Justice.

=== Statues of saints Barbara, Margaret and Elizabeth ===
(&quot;sousoší sv. Barbory, Markéty a Alžběty&quot;) The statues were sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1707. Although there is an inscription saying IOANN BROKOFF FECIT (&quot;made by Jan Brokoff&quot;), their style is evidence that his son Ferdinand is their true author.

=== Statue of the Lamentation of Christ ===
(&quot;sousoší Piety&quot;) Designed by Emanuel Max in 1858, upon commission from the Old Town&#x27;s public authorities, the statue depicts Mary Magdalene and the Virgin Mary mourning the dead Christ. At this position on the bridge, there was originally a wooden crucifix, which was destroyed by a flood in 1496. In 1695, a statue depicting the lamentation of Christ by Jan Brokoff was installed here; this was removed to the Monastery of Gracious Nurses under Petřín hill in Prague in 1859 and replaced by the current statue.

=== Statue of St. Joseph ===
(&quot;socha sv. Josefa&quot;) This statue was designed by Josef Max and sponsored by Josef Bergmann, a tradesman in Prague. It depicts St. Joseph leading a small Christ, and is situated on a pseudo-Gothic base. It replaced a statue with the same motif by Jan Brokoff, designed in 1706. This was damaged by cannon fire during the 1848 revolution and was replaced by the current statue in 1854.

=== Statue of St. Francis Xavier ===
(&quot;sousoší Františka Xaverského&quot;) This statue is a 1913 replica by Čeněk Vosmík of Ferdinand Brokoff&#x27;s original 1711 sculpture. The original sculpture was commissioned of the Faculty of Theology and Philosophy of Charles University, but fell into the river during the floods of 1890. The statue depicts an Indian and a Japanese prince being baptized by the saint, along with a Moor in chains and a Tatar.

=== Statue of St. Christopher ===
(&quot;socha sv. Kryštofa&quot;) This statue was designed by Emanuel Max in 1857 and sponsored by Václav Wanek, the portreeve of Prague. It depicts the saint holding Christ as a boy on his shoulder. The statue was originally conceived by Count Antonín Sporck, who wanted to build a marble statue as tribute to Charles VI in 1720. A plan of this was created by Matthias Braun, which was not executed.

=== Statue of St. Francis Borgia ===
(&quot;sousoší sv. Františka Borgiáše&quot;) This statue was commissioned from Ferdinand Brokoff by the imperial Burgrave František z Colletů in 1710. The sculpture portrays St. Borgia, a Jesuit priest, with two angels.

=== Statue of St. Ludmila ===
(&quot;socha sv. Ludmily&quot;) The exact date and sculptor responsible for this statue are not known, although it is believed that it was created by Matthias Braun around 1730. The sculpture was erected on the bridge in 1784 to replace the statue of St. Wenceslas damaged in the floods in that year. The statue depicts St. Ludmila teaching her grandson, St. Wenceslas and the base contains a relief sculpture showing the murder of St. Wenceslas.

=== Statue of St. Francis of Assisi ===
(&quot;socha sv. Františka Serafinského&quot;) Sculpted by Emanuel Max in 1855, the statue was donated by count František Antonín Kolowrat Liebsteinský. It portrays St. Francis standing with two Neoclassic angels, on a pseudo-baroque base. The sculpture replaced a similar statue designed in 1708 by František Preis.

=== Statue of Saints Vincent Ferrer and Procopius + Bruncvík column ===
(&quot;sousoší sv. Vincence Ferrarského a sv. Prokopa&quot;) One of the most artistically important pieces on the bridge, this statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1712, paid for by Romedius Josef František, the count Thun and lord of Choltice. St. Vincent is on the left, with a coffin and a kneeling penitent sinner by his legs. Saint Procopius of Sázava stands on a devil to the right.

Beside the statue of Sts. Vincent and Procopius stands a column with a sculpture of Bruncvik, (a mythical Bohemian knight inspired by the Saxonian and Bavarian knight Henry the Lion from Brunswick), portrayed helping a lion fight a seven-headed dragon. This was sculpted by Ludvík Šimek in 1884, and sponsored by the City of Prague. The knight, Bruncvík, is holding a golden sword, with a lion lying by his legs. This replaced a statue of Roland, erected in 1502, and was intended to remind passers-by of the Old Town&#x27;s privileges to the bridge, in particular the right to charge tolls and duty. It was damaged by cannon fire when the city was attacked by Swedish forces in 1648.

=== Statue of St. Nicholas of Tolentino ===
(&quot;socha sv. Mikuláše Tolentinského&quot;) Sculpted by Jan Bedřich Kohl in 1708, this statue was paid for by the Augustinian order convent of St. Thomas in Prague. The saint is portrayed standing on a simple base, together with an angel holding a basket of bread.

=== Statue of St. Luthgard (Dream of St. Luthgard) ===
(&quot;socha sv. Luitgardy&quot;) Possibly the most valuable piece of art on the bridge, the statue of St. Luthgard was sculpted by Matthias Braun in 1710 as a commission from Evžen Tyttl, the abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Plasy.

=== Statue of St. Adalbert ===

(&quot;socha sv. Vojtěcha&quot;) Designed by Michael and Ferdinand Brokoff in 1709, this statue was sponsored by Markus Bernard Joanelli, the councilor of the Old Town of Prague. The saint is represented with a prelate stick developing into a sea paddle and is standing on a base decorated with angels and the emblem of the donor.

=== Statues of Saints John of Matha, Felix of Valois, and Ivan ===
(&quot;sousoší sv. Jana z Mathy, Felixe z Valois a Ivana&quot;) The most spacious and expensive sculpture on the bridge, this was designed in 1714 by Ferdinand Brokoff and sponsored by František Josef Thun, the lord of Klášterec nad Ohří. The sculpture was intended to honour the two founders of the Trinitarians, the order that supervised buying back and redeeming of Christians in captivity under Turks. St. Ivan, the saint patron of Slavs was added to the group for unknown reasons. The base depicts a cave in which three chained Christians are praying to the Lord for salvation.

=== Statue of St. Wenceslas ===
(&quot;socha sv. Václava&quot;) This statue was designed by Karel Böhm in 1858 and was based on the design by Josef Kamil Führing. The statue was paid for by the Institute of the Blind at Klárov, Prague. Until 1822, various little shops stood on this part of the bridge.

==Statues on the north side of the bridge==
===Statue of the Madonna attending to St. Bernard===
(Czech: &quot;sousoší Madony se sv. Bernardem&quot;) This statue was sculpted by Matěj Václav Jäckl in 1709 and donated by the abbot of the Cistercian monastery in Osek, Benedikt Littwerig.

===Statue of the Madonna, Ss. Dominic and Thomas Aquinas===
(&quot;sousoší Madony se sv. Dominikem a Tomášem Akvinským&quot;) This group was sculpted by Matěj Václav Jäckel in 1708, and sponsored by the Dominicans Convent of St. Giles in the Old Town of Prague. The statue portrays the Madonna giving the Rosary to St. Dominic on the left, with St. Thomas Aquinas standing to the right.

===The Crucifix and Calvary===

(&quot;sousoší Kříže s Kalvárií&quot;) This sculpture is one of the most historically interesting sculptures on the bridge, which gradually gained its present appearance throughout many centuries. The original wooden crucifix was installed at this place soon after 1361 and probably destroyed by the Hussites in 1419. A new crucifix with a wooden corpus was erected in 1629, but was severely damaged by the Swedes towards the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The remnants of this crucifix can be found in the lapidarium of the National Museum in Prague. This was replaced by another wooden Calvary which, in turn, was replaced with a metal version in 1657. Bought in Dresden, this crucifix was originally made in 1629 by H. Hillger based upon a design by W. E. Brohn. In 1666, two lead figures were added, but these were replaced in 1861 by the present sandstone statues by Emanuel Max, portraying the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist.

The golden Hebrew text on the crucifix was added in 1696. In that year, the Prague authorities accused a local Jewish leader, named Elias Backoffen, of blasphemy. As his punishment he was ordered to raise the funds for the purchasing of gold-plated Hebrew letters, placed around the head of the statue, spelling out &quot;Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord of Hosts&quot;, the Kedusha from the Hebrew prayer and originating in the Book of Isaiah. The inscription was a symbolic humiliation and degradation of Prague Jews. A bronze tablet with explanatory text in Czech, English and Hebrew was mounted under the statue by the City of Prague in 2000. The tablet&#x27;s placement came after an American Rabbi, Ronald Brown of Temple Beth Am in Merrick, New York was passing over the bridge and noted the possibly offensive nature of the placing of the text. Upon a direct request to the mayor, the tablet was soon placed to the side of the statue.
===Statue of St. Anne===
(&quot;socha sv. Anny&quot;) Designed by Matěj Václav Jäckel in 1707, at the expense of count Rudolf of Lisov, the hetman of the New Town of Prague, this statue represents St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary, who is portrayed here as a young girl.

===Statue of St. Cyril and St. Methodius===
(&quot;sousoší sv. Cyrila a Metoděje&quot;) This statue was sculpted by Karel Dvořák between 1928 and 1938, and was erected by the Ministry of Education. It portrays the saints Cyril and Methodius (missionaries who introduced Christianity to the Slavs)and the crators of the Slavic languages, brought by them from Bulgaria. The Slavic nations are forever grateful to the Bulgarian state for bringing them letters to write the words of their new language.
The original statue of St. Ignatius which stood here, designed by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1711, was displaced by the floods of 1890 and can now be found in the Prague lapidarium.

===Statue of St. John the Baptist===
(&quot;socha sv. Jana Křtitele&quot;) Sculpted by Josef Max in 1857, at the expenses of Jan Norbert Gemrich of Neuberk, this statue depicts a standing St. John. This replaces a statue by Jan Brokoff, portraying the Baptism of Jesus by St. John, which stood in this position between 1706 and 1848.
===Statue of Saints Norbert of Xanten, Wenceslas and Sigismund===

(&quot;sousoší sv. Norberta, Václava a Zikmunda&quot;) This statue was designed by Josef Max in 1853, under the patronage of the abbot of Strahov Monastery, Dr. Jeroným Zeidler.

===Statue of St. John of Nepomuk===


(&quot;socha sv. Jana Nepomuckého&quot;) This statue is the oldest on the bridge. The original clay design was made by Austrian sculptor Matthias Rauchmüller, based upon a wood model by Jan Brokoff. The statue was then cast in bronze by Volfgang Jeroným Heroldt in Nuremberg. The saint is presented in a traditional way, as a bearded capitulary with a five-star glory, standing on a tripartite base. The base portrays scenes from the life of St. John of Nepomuk, including the confession of Queen Johanna and the saint&#x27;s death. In 1393 St. John of Nepomuk was thrown from the bridge into the river where he drowned. In modern times it has become traditional to touch the bridge here; this is held to bring good fortune and to ensure that the visitor will return to the city of Prague.


===Statue of St. Anthony of Padua===
(&quot;socha sv. Antonína Paduánského&quot;) Designed by Jan Oldřich Mayer in 1707 and sponsored by Krištof Mořice Withauer, councilor of the Prague Castle burgraviate, this statue represents St. Anthony standing between two vases, holding Jesus.
===Statue of St. Jude Thaddeus===
(&quot;socha sv. Juda Tadeáše&quot;) This sculpture portrays St. Jude holding a rod. It was sculpted by Jan Oldřich Mayer in 1708 and paid for by František Sezima, the knight Mitrovský from Nemyšle and Jeřichovice.

===Statue of St. Augustine===

(&quot;socha sv. Augustina&quot;) Designed by Jan Bedřich Kohl in 1708 and paid for by the Augustinian convent of St. Thomas in Prague, this portrays the philosopher holding a hook and a burning heart. He is followed by an angel attempting to pour the sea out of a sea-shell.


===Statue of St. Cajetan===
(&quot;socha sv. Kajetána&quot;) This statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1709, and sponsored by the convent of Theatins in Prague. The Saint, founder of the religious order of Theatins, is portrayed holding a book and standing before an obelisk representing the Trinity.

===Statue of St. Philip Benitius===
(&quot;socha sv. Filipa Benicia&quot;) Designed by Michal Bernard Mandel in 1714, this statue was made from Salzburg marble and donated by the Servites convent in Prague. The statue portrays St. Philip Benitius, fifth general of the Servites, holding a cross, a book and a spray. By his legs there is the crown of the Pope. A clay model of this statue can be found in the Salzburg museum.
===Statuary of St. Vitus===
(&quot;socha sv. Víta&quot;) Sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1714, this statue was donated by Matěj Vojtěch Macht of Löwenmacht, the dean of the Vyšehrad canonry. St. Vitus is portrayed standing on a base in the shape of cave, from which lions crawl up. The Saint is depicted as a Roman aristocrat, martyred for his faith. Duke Wenceslas acquired a number of his relics to honor the founding of St. Vitus Cathedral at Prague Castle. These relics, together with others acquired by Charles IV in 1355, are embedded in the cathedral building.

=== Statue of the Holy Savior with Cosmas and Damian ===
(&quot;sousoší sv. Salvatora se sv. Kosmou a Damiánem&quot;) Designed by Jan Oldřich Mayer in 1709, at the expense of the faculty of medicine, University of Prague, this statue portrays Jesus with the patron saints of medicine placed on either side.

<doc id="551359" wikidata="Q2009727" url="?curid=551359" title="Magnetic quantum number">
<text>In atomic physics, a magnetic quantum number is a quantum number used to distinguish quantum states of an electron or other particle according to its angular momentum along a given axis in space. The orbital magnetic quantum number ( or ) distinguishes the orbitals available within a given subshell of an atom. It specifies the component of the orbital angular momentum that lies along a given axis, conventionally called the &quot;z&quot;-axis, so it describes the orientation of the orbital in space. The spin magnetic quantum number specifies the &quot;z&quot;-axis component of the spin angular momentum for a particle having spin quantum number . For an electron, is , and is either + or −, often called &quot;spin-up&quot; and &quot;spin-down&quot;, or α and β. The term &quot;magnetic&quot; in the name refers to the magnetic dipole moment associated with each type of angular momentum, so states having different magnetic quantum numbers shift in energy in a magnetic field according to the Zeeman effect.

The four quantum numbers conventionally used to describe the quantum state of an electron in an atom are the principal quantum number &quot;n&quot;, the azimuthal (orbital) quantum number formula_1, and the magnetic quantum numbers and . Electrons in a given subshell of an atom (such as s, p, d, or f) are defined by values of formula_1 (0, 1, 2, or 3). The orbital magnetic quantum number takes integer values in the range from formula_3 to formula_4, including zero. Thus the s, p, d, and f subshells contain 1, 3, 5, and 7 orbitals each. Each of these orbitals can accommodate up to two electrons (with opposite spins), forming the basis of the periodic table.

Other magnetic quantum numbers are similarly defined, such as for the &quot;z&quot;-axis component the total electronic angular momentum , and for the nuclear spin . Magnetic quantum numbers are capitalized to indicate totals for a system of particles, such as or for the total &quot;z&quot;-axis orbital angular momentum of all the electrons in an atom.

==Derivation==

There is a set of quantum numbers associated with the energy states of the atom. The four quantum numbers formula_5, formula_1, formula_7, and formula_8 specify the complete quantum state of a single electron in an atom called its wavefunction or orbital. The Schrödinger equation for the wavefunction of an atom with one electron is a separable partial differential equation. (This is not the case for the neutral helium atom or other atoms with mutually interacting electrons, which require more sophisticated methods for solution) This means that the wavefunction as expressed in spherical coordinates can be broken down into the product of three functions of the radius, colatitude (or polar) angle, and azimuth:

:formula_9

The differential equation for formula_10 can be solved in the form formula_11. Because values of the azimuth angle formula_12 differing by 2formula_13 radians (360 degrees) represent the same position in space, and the overall magnitude of formula_10 does not grow with arbitrarily large formula_12 as it would for a real exponent, the coefficient formula_16 must be quantized to integer multiples of formula_17, producing an imaginary exponent: formula_18. These integers are the magnetic quantum numbers. The same constant appears in the colatitude equation, where larger values of formula_19 tend to decrease the magnitude of formula_20 and values of formula_7 greater than the azimuthal quantum number formula_1 do not permit any solution for formula_23

== As a component of angular momentum ==

The axis used for the polar coordinates in this analysis is chosen arbitrarily. The quantum number formula_7 refers to the projection of the angular momentum in this arbitrarily-chosen direction, conventionally called the formula_25-direction or quantization axis. formula_26, the magnitude of the angular momentum in the formula_25-direction, is given by the formula:

:formula_28.

This is a component of the atomic electron&#x27;s total orbital angular momentum formula_29, whose magnitude is related to the azimuthal quantum number of its subshell formula_1 by the equation:

:formula_31,

where formula_32 is the reduced Planck constant. Note that this formula_33 for formula_34 and approximates formula_35 for high formula_1. It is not possible to measure the angular momentum of the electron along all three axes simultaneously. These properties were first demonstrated in the Stern–Gerlach experiment, by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach.

== Effect in magnetic fields ==
The quantum number formula_7 refers, loosely, to the direction of the angular momentum vector. The magnetic quantum number formula_7 only affects the electron&#x27;s energy if it is in a magnetic field because in the absence of one, all spherical harmonics corresponding to the different arbitrary values of formula_7 are equivalent. The magnetic quantum number determines the energy shift of an atomic orbital due to an external magnetic field (the Zeeman effect) — hence the name &quot;magnetic&quot; quantum number. However, the actual magnetic dipole moment of an electron in an atomic orbital arises not only from the electron angular momentum but also from the electron spin, expressed in the spin quantum number.

Since each electron has a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, it will be subject to a torque which tends to make the vector formula_29 parallel to the field, a phenomenon known as Larmor precession.

<text>Mostar (, ) is a city and the administrative centre of Herzegovina-Neretva Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the historical capital of Herzegovina.

Mostar is situated on the Neretva River and is the fifth-largest city in the country. Mostar was named after the bridge keepers (&quot;mostari&quot;) who guarded the Stari Most (Old Bridge) over the Neretva during the Ottoman era. The Old Bridge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, commissioned by Suleiman the Magnificent in the 16th century, is one of Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s most visited landmarks, and is considered an exemplary piece of Islamic architecture in the Balkans.

==History==
===Ancient and medieval history===
Human settlements on the river Neretva, between Mount Hum and the Velež Mountain, have existed since prehistory, as witnessed by discoveries of fortified enceintes and cemeteries. Evidence of Roman occupation was discovered beneath the present town.

As far as medieval Mostar goes, although the Christian basilicas of late antiquity remained in use, few historical sources were preserved and not much is known about this period. The name of Mostar was first mentioned in a document dating from 1474, taking its name from the bridge-keepers (&quot;mostari&quot;); this refers to the existence of a wooden bridge from the market on the left bank of the river which was used by traders, soldiers, and other travelers. During this time it was also the seat of a kadiluk (district with a regional judge). Since Mostar was on the trade route between the Adriatic and the mineral-rich regions of central Bosnia, the settlement began to spread to the right bank of the river.

Prior to 1474 the names of two towns appear in medieval historical sources, along with their later medieval territories and properties – the towns of Nebojša and Cimski grad. In the early 15th century the county (&quot;župa&quot;) of Večenike covered the site of the present-day Mostar along the right bank of the Neretva, including the sites of Zahum, Cim, Ilići, Raštani and Vojno. It was at the center of this area, which in 1408 belonged to Radivojević, who built Cim Fort (prior to 1443). Mostar is indirectly referred to in a 1454 charter of King Alfonso V of Aragon as &quot;Pons&quot; (&quot;bridge&quot;), for a bridge had already been built there. Prior to 1444, the Nebojša Tower was built on the left bank of the Neretva, which belonged to the late medieval county still known as Večenike or Večerić. The earliest documentary reference to Mostar as a settlement dates from 3 April 1452, when Ragusans from Dubrovnik wrote to their fellow countrymen in the service of Serbian Despot Đorđe Branković to say that Vladislav Hercegović had turned against his father Stjepan and occupied the town of Blagaj and other places, including &quot;“Duo Castelli al ponte de Neretua.”&quot;.

===Ottoman period===

In 1468 the region came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire and the urbanization of the settlement began. It was named &quot;Köprühisar&quot;, meaning fortress at the bridge, at the centre of which was a cluster of 15 houses. The town was organized into two distinct areas: &quot;čaršija&quot;, the crafts and commercial centre of the settlement, and &quot;mahala&quot; or a residential area.

The town was fortified between the years 1520 and 1566, and the wooden bridge rebuilt in stone. In 1519 (Hijri 925) the settlement was recorded as a castle and both as Mostar and as Köprühisar and it was inhabited by Muslims and Christians. It had four Muslim households and 85 Christian households. The stone bridge, the Old Bridge (&quot;Stari most&quot;), was erected in 1566 on the orders of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and at long and high, quickly became a wonder in its own time. Later becoming the city&#x27;s symbol, the Old Bridge was designed by Mimar Hayruddin, a student and apprentice of Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan. In the late 16th century, Köprühisar was one of the towns of the Sanjak of Herzegovina. In the 17th century, Turkish traveler and author Evliya Çelebi wrote of the bridge thus:
The first church in the city of Mostar, a Serbian Orthodox Church, was built in 1834 during Ottoman rule.

===Austrian and Yugoslav period===
Austria-Hungary took control over Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878 and ruled the region until the aftermath of World War I in 1918, when it became part of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and then Yugoslavia. During this period, Mostar was the main urban centre of Herzegovina. In 1881, the town became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mostar-Duvno and, in 1939, it became a part of the Banovina of Croatia. During World War II, Mostar was annexed into the Nazi German fascist puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia.

During the period of Austro-Hungarian rule (1878–1918), Mostar&#x27;s city council cooperated with the Austro-Hungarian administration to implement sweeping reforms in city planning: broad avenues and an urban grid were imposed on the western bank of the Neretva, and significant investments were made in infrastructure, communications and housing. City administrators like Mustafa Mujaga Komadina were central players in these transformations, which facilitated growth and linked the eastern and western banks of the city. Noteworthy examples of Austro-Hungarian architecture include Hotel Neretva, the Municipality building, which was designed by the architect Josip Vancaš from Sarajevo, residential districts around the Rondo, and Gimnazija Mostar from 1902 designed by František Blažek.
After World War II, Mostar developed industries producing plastics, tobacco, bauxite, wine, aircraft and aluminium. Several dams (&quot;Grabovica&quot;, &quot;Salakovac&quot;, &quot;Mostar&quot;) were built in the region to harness the hydroelectric power of the Neretva. The city was a major industrial and tourist center and prospered economically during the time of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

Between 1948 and 1974 the industrial base was expanded with construction of a metal-working factory, cotton textile mills, and an aluminum plant. Skilled workers, both men and women, entered the work force and the social and demographic profile of the city was broadened dramatically; between 1945 and 1980, Mostar&#x27;s population grew from 18,000 to 100,000.

Because Mostar&#x27;s eastern bank was burdened by inadequate infrastructure, the city expanded on the western bank with the construction of large residential blocks. Local architects favored an austere modernist aesthetic, prefabrication and repetitive modules. Commercial buildings in the functionalist style appeared on the historic eastern side of the city as well, replacing more intimate timber constructions that had survived since Ottoman times. In the 1970s and 1980s, a healthy local economy fueled by foreign investment spurred recognition and conservation of the city&#x27;s cultural heritage. An economically sustainable plan to preserve the old town of Mostar was implemented by the municipality, which drew thousands of tourists from the Adriatic coast and invigorated the economy of the city. The results of this ten-year project earned Mostar an Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1986.

According to the 1991 census, Mostar had 127,000 inhabitants with roughly an equal number of Bosniaks (34.6%) and Croats (34%), 18.8% Serbs, and 13.6% of those who declared themselves Yugoslavs or Others.

===Bosnian War===

After Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence from Yugoslavia in April 1992, the town was besieged by the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA), following clashes between the JNA and Croat forces. The Croats were organized into the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) and were joined by a sizable number of Bosniaks. The JNA artillery periodically shelled neighbourhoods outside of their control from early April.

On 7 June the Croatian Army (HV) launched an offensive code named Operation Jackal, the objective of which was to relieve Mostar and break the JNA siege of Dubrovnik. The offensive was supported by the HVO, which attacked the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) positions around Mostar. By 12 June the HVO secured the western part of the city and by 21 June the VRS was completely pushed out from the eastern part. Numerous religious buildings and most of the city&#x27;s bridges were destroyed or severely damaged during the fighting. Among them were the Catholic Cathedral of Mary, Mother of the Church, the Franciscan Church and Monastery, the Bishop&#x27;s Palace and 12 out of 14 mosques in the city. After the VRS was pushed from the city, the Serbian Orthodox Žitomislić Monastery and the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity were demolished.

Throughout late 1992, tensions between Croats and Bosniaks increased in Mostar. In early 1993 the Croat–Bosniak War escalated and by mid-April 1993 Mostar had become a divided city with the western part dominated by HVO forces and the eastern part controlled by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). Fighting broke out in May when both sides of the city came under intense artillery fire. The city was divided along ethnic lines, with a number of offensives taking place, resulting in a series of stalemates. The Croat–Bosniak conflict ended with the signing of the Washington Agreement in 1994, and the Bosnian War ended with the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Around 2,000 people died in Mostar during the war.

Two wars (Serb forces versus Bosniak and Croatian and Croat-Bosniak war) left Mostar physically devastated and ethno-territorially divided between a Croat-majority west bank (with ca. 55,000 residents) and a Bosniak-majority old City and east bank (with ca. 50,000 residents), with the frontline running parallel to the Neretva River. Most Serbs had fled the city.

===Post-war developments===
Since the end of the wider war in 1995, great progress has been made in the reconstruction of the city of Mostar under the European Union Administration of the City of Mostar (EUAM). Over 15 million dollars has been spent on restoration.

A monumental project to rebuild the Old Bridge, which was destroyed during the Bosnian War by HVO, to the original design, and restore surrounding structures and historic neighbourhoods was initiated in 1999 and mostly completed by spring 2004. The money for this reconstruction was donated by Spain (who had a sizable contingent of peacekeeping troops stationed in the surrounding area during the conflict), the United States, Turkey, Italy, the Netherlands, and Croatia. A grand opening was held on 23 July 2004 under heavy security.

In parallel, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the World Monuments Fund, with funding provided by the World Bank, undertook a five-year-long restoration and rehabilitation effort to regenerate the most significant areas of historic Mostar, and particularly the urban tissue around the Old Bridge. Also in July 2004, the Stari Grad Agency was launched to operate and maintain the restored buildings, including the Old Bridge complex, and promote Mostar as a cultural and tourist destination.

In July 2005, UNESCO inscribed the Old Bridge and its closest vicinity onto the World Heritage List.

International reconstruction efforts also aimed at the reunification of the divided city. The February 1996 Mostar Agreement led to the adoption of the Interim Statute of the city the same month, and to a 1-year period of EUAM, headed by former Bremen mayor Hans Koschnick, until early 1997.

After six years of implementation, in 2003 OHR Paddy Ashdown established an &quot;international commission for reforming Mostar&quot;, whose final report noted how the HDZ/SDA power-sharing in Mostar had entrenched division and corruption, with &quot;rampant parallelism&quot; in administrative structures and usurpation of power by the municipalities over the City. A new Statute was negotiated, and finally imposed in February 2004 by OHR Paddy Ashdown.

In November 2010, the Constitutional Court struck down as discriminatory the electoral framework for Mostar. The Bosniak and Croat ruling parties were unable, however, to reach a new compromise. Lacking a legal basis, local elections could not take place in Mostar in 2012 and 2016, and outgoing mayor Ljubo Bešlić (HDZ BiH) remained in office as the only person authorised to allocate the city budget on an emergency basis. Almost a decade without administration led to a decline in service provision, including trash collection. In October 2019 Irma Baralija won a case against Bosnia and Herzegovina at the European Court of Human Rights for the lack of elections in Mostar. Finally, a political deal, agreed under international mediation in June 2020, enabled legislative amendments in July 2020 and the conduct of the vote in Mostar on 20 December 2020.

==Architecture==



Mostar has architecturally noteworthy buildings in a wide range of styles. Historicist architectural styles reflected cosmopolitan interest and exposure to foreign aesthetic trends and were artfully merged with indigenous styles. Examples include the Italianate Franciscan church, the Ottoman Muslibegovića house, the Dalmatian Ćorović House and an Orthodox church which was built as gift from the Sultan.

The Ottomans used monumental architecture to affirm, extend and consolidate their colonial holdings. Administrators and bureaucrats – many of them indigenous people who converted from Christianity to Islam – founded mosque complexes that generally included Koranic schools, soup kitchens or markets.
Out of the thirteen original mosques dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, seven have been lost during the 20th century for ideological reasons or by bombardment. One of the two 19th-century Orthodox churches has also disappeared, while the early 20th-century synagogue, after suffering severe damage in the World War II, has been converted into a theatre. Several Ottoman inns also survived, along with other buildings from this period of Mostar&#x27;s history, such as fountains and schools.

The majority of administrative buildings are from the Austro-Hungarian period and have neoclassical and Secessionist characteristics. A number of surviving late Ottoman houses demonstrate the component features of this form of domestic architecture – upper storey for residential use, hall, paved courtyard, and veranda on one or two storeys. The later 19th-century residential houses are predominantly in neoclassical style.

A number of early trading and craft buildings still exist, notably some low shops in wood or stone, stone storehouses, and a group of former tanneries round an open courtyard. Once again, the 19th-century commercial buildings are predominantly neoclassical. A number of elements of the early fortifications are visible, namely the Hercegusa Tower dating from the medieval period. By contrast, the Ottoman defence edifices are represented by the Halebinovka and Tara Towers – the watchtowers on the ends of the Old Bridge, and a stretch of the ramparts.

The oldest single arch stone bridge in Mostar, the Kriva Cuprija (&quot;Sloping Bridge&quot;), was built in 1558 by the Ottoman architect Cejvan Kethoda. It is said that this was to be a test before the major construction of the Stari Most began. The Old Bridge was completed in 1566 and was hailed as one of the greatest architectural achievements in the Ottoman [Balkans]]. The single-arch stone bridge is an exact replica of the original bridge that stood for over 400 years and that was designed by Hajrudin, a student of the great Ottoman architect Sinan. It spans of the Neretva river, above the summer water level. The Halebija and Tara towers have always housed the guardians of the bridge and during Ottoman times were also used as storehouses for ammunition. The arch is a perfect semicircle in width and in height. The frontage and vault are made of regular stone cubes incorporated into the horizontal layers all along the vault. The space between vault, frontal walls and footpath is filled with cracked stone. The bridge footpath and the approaching roads are paved with cobblestones, as are the main roads in the town. Stone steps enable people to ascend to the bridge from either side. During the armed conflict between Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats in the Bosnian War in the 1990s, the bridge was destroyed by the HVO (Croatian Defence Council).

The Cejvan Cehaj Mosque, built in 1552, is the oldest mosque in Mostar. Later a madrasa (Islamic school) was built on the same compound. The Old Bazaar, Kujundziluk, is named after the goldsmiths who traditionally created and sold their wares on this street, and still sells authentic paintings and copper or bronze carvings of the Stari Most, pomegranates (the natural symbol of Herzegovina), or the stećaks (medieval tombstones).

The Koski Mehmed Paša Mosque, built in 1617, is open to visitors. Visitors may enter the mosque and take photos free of charge. The minaret is also open to the public and is accessible from inside the mosque. Just around the corner from the mosque is the Tepa Market. This has been a busy marketplace since Ottoman times. It now sells mostly fresh produce grown in Herzegovina and, when in season, the figs and pomegranates are extremely popular. Local honey is also a prominent specialty, being produced all around Herzegovina.

==Culture==

Magazine Most, along with Šantić&#x27;s Poetry Evenings, was most important outlet for cultural and artistic production in the city and the region, offering space for upstart poets and writers.
Dani Matice Hrvatske is one of city&#x27;s significant cultural events and it is commonly sponsored by the Croatian Government and the Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mostar Summer is another umbrella event which includes Šantić Poetry Evenings, Mostar Summer Festival and Festival of Bosnia and Herzegovina choirs/ensembles. The city is a home of music festival named Melodije Mostara (Mostar Melodies), which has been held annually since 1995. Theatre festivals include Mostarska Liska (organized by the National Theatre Mostar) and The Mostar Spring (organized by the Matica hrvatska Mostar).

Mostar art institutions include:
*Croatian Lodge &quot;Herceg Stjepan Kosača&quot;
*Cultural Center Mostar
*OKC Abrašević (English: Abrašević Youth Center)
*Pavarotti Music Centre
*Croatian National Theatre in Mostar
*National Theatre Mostar
*Museum of the Old Bridge
*Herzegovina Museum
*Mostar Youth Theatre
*Aluminij Gallery
*Birthplace of Svetozar Ćorović (Aleksa Šantić House)
*Muslibegović House
*World Music Centre
*Puppet Theatre Mostar

Mostar cuisine is balanced between Western and Eastern influences. Traditional Mostar food is closely related to Turkish, Middle Eastern and other Mediterranean cuisines. However, due to years of Austrian rule and influence, there are many culinary influences from Central Europe.
Some of the dishes include ćevapčići, burek, sarma, japrak, musaka, dolma, sujuk, sač, đuveč, and sataraš. Local desserts include baklava, hurmašice, sutlijaš, tulumbe, tufahije, and šampita.

==Economy==
Mostar&#x27;s economy relies heavily on the aluminium &amp; metal industry, banking services &amp; the telecommunication sector. The city is home of some of the country&#x27;s largest corporations.

Along with Sarajevo &amp; Banja Luka, it is the largest financial center in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina. One of three largest banks in the country has its headquarters in Mostar. Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina has three national electric, postal &amp; telecommunication service corporations; the seat of one per each group is placed in Mostar (electric utility provider Elektroprivreda HZHB, postal service company Hrvatska pošta Mostar &amp; HT Eronet, the third largest telecommunication company in the country). These three companies (along with banks &amp; aluminium factory) make a vast portion of overall economic activity in the city. 

Prior to the 1992–1995 Bosnian War, Mostar relied on other important companies which had been closed, damaged or downsized. They included SOKO (military aircraft factory) &amp; Hepok (food industry). In 1981, Mostar&#x27;s GDP per capita was 103% of the Yugoslav average.

Aluminum manufacturing company Aluminij Industries is the sole remaining large company that was prominent during the former Yugoslavia. It is one of the country&#x27;s largest exporter companies &amp; it has a number of international partners. It is one of the most influential companies in the region as well. The city of Mostar alone has direct income of €40 million annually from Aluminij.

Considering the fact that three dams are situated on the city of Mostar&#x27;s territory, the city has a solid base for further development of production. There is also an ongoing project for the possible use of wind power &amp; building of windmills. The private sector has seen a notable increase in small &amp; medium enterprises over the past couple of years contributing to the positive business climate. 

Mostar also hosts the annual International Economic Fair Mostar (&quot;Međunarodni sajam gospodarstva Mostar&quot;) which was first held in 1997.

==Demographics==

In 2013 the municipality had a total population of 105,797 according to the census results and the city itself had a population of 60,195.

===Ethnic groups===
Its population consists of the following ethnic groups: Croats (48.4%); Bosniaks (44.1%) and Serbs (4.1%). The city of Mostar has the largest population of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. As in many other cities, its demographic profile was significantly altered after the Bosnian War.

According to the official data of the local elections of 2008, among six city election districts, three western ones (Croat-majority) had 53,917 registered voters, and those three on the east (Bosniak-majority) had 34,712 voters.

The ethnic composition of the city of Mostar, per indicated census years:
===Settlements and neighborhoods===
The City of Mostar (aside from city proper) includes the following settlements:
After the Bosnian War, following the Dayton Agreement, the villages of Kamena, Kokorina and Zijemlje were separated from Mostar to form the new municipality of Istočni Mostar (East Mostar), in the Republika Srpska.

==Climate==
Mostar, and Herzegovina area in general, experience a modified humid subtropical climate (Cfa) under the Köppen Climate Classification, with cold, humid winters and hot, drier summers. In the summer months, occasional temperatures above are not uncommon. In 1901, a temperature of was measured in the city, which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The coldest month is January, averaging about , and the warmest month is July, averaging about . The sunniest months are between June and September. The remainder of the year is wet and mild. Mostar is the sunniest city in the country with an average of 2291 solar hours a year. Snow is relatively rare, and it usually melts within a few hours or days.

During the 2012 European cold wave, Mostar experienced unusually cold weather with freezing temperatures lasting for days and a record snow depth of .
==Governance==
The City of Mostar has the status of a municipality. The city government is led by the mayor - since 15 February 2021 Mario Kordić (HDZ BiH).

===Interim Statute (1996–2004)===
International reconstruction efforts aimed at the reunification of the divided city. The February 1996 Mostar Agreement led to the adoption of the Interim Statute of the city the same month and to a 1-year period of EU Administration of Mostar (EUAM), headed by former Bremen mayor Hans Koschnick, till early 1997.

The Interim Statute introduced a Yugoslav-style two-level of administration, with a City level with its own council and mayor (with two deputies) and six municipalities, each with its own administration and council, reflecting the wartime division: three in the Croat-majority West Mostar, and three in the Bosniak-majority East Mostar. A tiny &quot;Central Zone&quot; strip (not a municipality) was to host the rebuilt institutions of the city and, according to the original plans, also of the Federation entity.
Mostar citizens would cast three votes: the first two for the City council&#x27;s 48 members (half from a city-wide lift and half from candidates in each municipality, 4 each), and the third to elect the members of the councils of the six municipalities. Ethnic quotas and veto rights were to prevent any domination.

===2004 Statute===
After six years of implementation, in 2003 OHR Paddy Ashdown established an &quot;international commission for reforming Mostar&quot;, whose final report noted how the HDZ/SDA power-sharing in Mostar had entrenched division and corruption, with &quot;rampant parallelism&quot; in administrative structures and usurpation of power by the municipalities over the City. The Mostar Commission, headed by another former German mayor, Norbert Winterstein, gathered members of all Mostar parties with the overarching aim of reuniting the city. A new Statute was negotiated, although few points of contention remained. Finally, in February 2004 OHR Paddy Ashdown imposed via its Bonn Powers the new City Statute and related amendments to the BiH Election Law and cantonal and Federation Constitutions. The 2004 Statute abolished the six municipalities and created a unified City administration with a single budget and one Mayor of Mostar, with no deputies. Ethnic quotas in the City council were replaced by minimum/maximum thresholds; 17 councillors would now be elected from a city-wide list, and 18 from the territories of the six former municipalities, now &quot;city areas&quot;, which retained a single residual competence on &quot;the distribution of revenues deriving from allocated construction land&quot;, managed by city area &quot;commissions&quot; formed by the 3 city councillors elected in each one. The &quot;central zone&quot; remained outside any city area, and its residents were only entitled to vote for the city-wide list.

According to the City Statute, imposed by High Representative Paddy Ashdown on 28 January 2004 after local politicians failed to reach an agreement, the mayor of Mostar has to be elected by the city council with a two-thirds majority. Ashdown abolished the six municipalities that were divided equally among Bosniaks and Croats and replaced them with six electoral units, ridding Mostar of duplicate institutions and costs. In the process Ashdown also reduced the number of elected officials from 194 to 35. According to the City Statute, the constituent peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs) are guaranteed a minimum of four seats and a maximum of 15 seats. 18 councillors are elected by election units (3 councillors from each of the 6 districts) and 15 councillors from a city-wide list. This move was opposed by the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH).

===2008 elections===
On the basis of the 2008 election, the City Council was composed of 35 councillors from the following parties:

*Party of Democratic Action (SDA) 12
*People&#x27;s Party Work for Prosperity (NSRzB) 7
*Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH) 7
*Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina (SDP BiH) 3
*Croatian Democratic Union 1990 (HDZ 1990) 3
*Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina (SBiH) 2
*Croatian Party of Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HSP BiH) 1

Relative winners were SDA with the greatest number of votes. However, neither party had enough votes to ensure election of the mayor from their party. The City Council met 16 times without success. Eventually, OHR was involved, and High Representative made some minor changes to the City Statute. After that, Ljubo Bešlić (HDZ BiH) was reelected as a mayor.

===2010 Constitutional Court ruling===
Following an appeal by HDZ BiH, in November 2010 the Constitutional Court found the electoral framework for Mostar (2004 Statute) to be discriminatory and unconstitutional. Among other things, the Constitutional Court noted that the votes of Mostar residents did not count the same, as the six electoral zones all elected 3 councillors despite their different population (with the smallest having 4 times fewer residents than the largest); and that the voters from the &quot;central zone&quot; counted less, as they only elected representatives from the city-wide list and not from any of the electoral zones.
The Court annulled the relevant provisions of the Election Law of BiH and of the 2004 Statute, and ordered the Parliamentary Assembly of BiH and the Mostar city assembly to revise them within six months. Yet, the Bosniak and Croat ruling parties did not get to a compromise.

===Interim administration (2012–2020)===
In the absence of a legal basis, local elections could not take place in Mostar in 2012 and 2016. The mandate of the City council also expired in 2012. Bešlić thus remained as acting mayor for eight additional years, during which he affirmed that he considered resigning multiple times, also due to his deteriorating health. During this time, he shared the administrative duties with Izet Šahović, head of the Mostar City&#x27;s Finance Department, a bureaucrat and member of the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA). For two full mandates, Bešlić and Šahović have decided together how to disburse Mostar&#x27;s yearly 30 million euro budget, without any legislative oversight or public transparency. The situation has been denounced by multiple NGOs, which have pointed at the SDA-HDZ power-sharing as the source of the mal-administration of Mostar and the recurrent problems with trash collection, water treatment, and continued ethnic duplication of the city services.

During this period, several rounds of talks were held with international facilitation. Between October 2012 and May 2013 Deputy High Representative Roderick W. Moore launched an 8-months mediation effort that produced a compromise framework aimed at merging the city areas (and central zone) into multi-ethnic voting districts. This was endorsed by the Peace Implementation Council&#x27;s Steering Board (PIC SB). Yet, the proposal found no political support when it was submitted by Moore&#x27;s successor Tamir G. Waser in July 2014 to the BiH Parliament. A second mediation attempt led by US and UK ambassadors to BiH, Maureen Cormack and Edward Ferguson, and based on a model with a single city-wide electoral district, also failed [in 2017]. In 2018, the two main parties HDZ BiH and SDA autonomously negotiated a compromise solution, based only on a formula for the election of the councillors from each city area along the &quot;one man, one vote&quot; principle, which would be later taken up in the June 2020 agreement. 

In October 2019, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the case brought by Irma Baralija on the absence of electoral rights for the residents of Mostar. In July 2020, the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina amended the electoral law to allow for local elections in Mostar to be held in December 2020.

==Education==

Mostar has a number of various educational institutions. These include University of Mostar, University Džemal Bijedić of Mostar, United World College in Mostar, nineteen high-schools and twenty four elementary schools. High-schools include sixteen vocational schools and three gymnasiums.

All public schools in Mostar, both elementary and secondary education, are divided between Croat curriculum and Federal (unofficially Bosniak) curriculum schools. This ethnic division of schools was emplaced during the very first year of the Bosnian war and it continues, with some modifications, to this day. Today, the schools in Mostar and throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina are a site of struggle between ethno-national political elites in ways that reveals the precarious position of youth in the volatile nation building processes A partial exception to divided education is Gimnazija Mostar (also known as &quot;Stara gimnazija&quot;) that implemented joint school administration and some joint student courses. However, Croat and Bosniak students in Gimnazija Mostar continue to have most courses according to the “national” curriculum, among them the so-called national subjects – history, literature, geography, and religion.

The country&#x27;s higher education reform and the signing of the Bologna Process have forced both universities to put aside their rivalry to some extent and try to make themselves more competitive on a regional level.

University of Mostar is the second largest university in the country and the only Croatian language university in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It was founded in 1977 as the University &quot;Džemal Bijedić&quot; of Mostar, but changed name in 1992. The origin of the university can be traced back to the Herzegovina Franciscan Theological School, which was founded in 1895 and closed in 1945, was the first higher education institution in Mostar. Today&#x27;s University seal shows the building of the Franciscan Monastery.

University Džemal Bijedić of Mostar was founded in 1993. It employs around 250 professors and staff members. According to the Federal Office of Statistics, Džemal Bijedić University had 2,522 students enrolled during the 2012/2013 academic year.

 school year, the University of Mostar had 10,712 students enrolled at eleven faculties making it the largest university in the city.
Cumulatively, it has been attended by more than 40,000 students since the start of the Bologna process of education.

==Sports==
One of the most popular sports in Mostar is football. The two most successful teams are HŠK Zrinjski and FK Velež. FK Velež won the Yugoslav Cup in 1981 and in 1986, which was one of the most significant accomplishments this club has achieved. Since the Bosnian War, each club has generally been supported by a particular ethnic group (Velež for the Bosniaks and Zrinjski for the Croats). The matches between the two clubs are some of the country&#x27;s most intense matches. Since the start of the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, HŠK Zrinjski has won eight championships.

In basketball, HKK Zrinjski Mostar competes at the nation&#x27;s highest level while the Zrinjski banner also represents the city in the top handball league. Vahid Halilhodžić, a former Bosnian football player and current manager of the Morocco national football team, started his professional career in FK Velež Mostar.

In 2011, rugby union football club RK Herceg was founded. The club competes in national leagues within Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina and in the regional league Adria Sevens.

Another popular sport in Mostar is swimming. There are three swimming teams in Mostar: PK Velež, KVS Orka and APK Zrinjski. The best Bosnian-Herzegovinian swimmer, Lana Pudar, is from Mostar. Mostar has plenty of talented swimmers despite having just one 25-meter pool and one 12.5-meter pool.

<text>This is a list of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), which are minor planets in the Solar System that orbit the Sun at a greater distance on average than Neptune, that is, their orbit has a semi-major axis greater than 30.1 astronomical units (AU). The Kuiper belt, scattered disk, and Oort cloud are three conventional divisions of this volume of space. , the catalog of minor planets contains 1060 numbered TNOs. In addition, there are more than 3,500 unnumbered TNOs, which have been observed since 1993.

This list consists of all types of TNO subgroups: classical Kuiper belt objects, also known as &quot;cubewanos&quot;, the resonant trans-Neptunian objects with their main and higher-order resonant subgroups, the scattered disc objects (SDOs), and the extreme trans-Neptunian objects including the ESDOs, EDDOs, and sednoids, which have a semi-major axis of at least 150 AU and a perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) greater than that of Neptune. The list also contains several centaurs, if the object&#x27;s orbit has a sufficiently large semi-major axis (a). Centaurs have unstable orbits in which the perihelion (q) is well inside of Neptune&#x27;s orbit but the farthest point (aphelion, Q) is very distant.

The first TNO to be discovered was Pluto in 1930. It became the namesake of a larger group of resonant objects called plutinos (another such resonant subgroup are the twotinos). It took more than 60 years to discover a second TNO, Albion (provisionally known as ), in 1992. The largest known trans-Neptunian objects are Pluto and , followed by , , , , , and , all of them being officially recognized as dwarf planets by the IAU except for Gonggong, Sedna, and Orcus. There are also many possible dwarf planets, such as , , , , and . Most TNOs have low albedos typically around 0.09. Their color varies from blue-grey to very red (classes BB, BR, IR and RR). The following list also gives an object&#x27;s full designation, mean-diameter (D), and discovery circumstances (date, discoverer and discovery site), as well as its orbital inclination (&quot;i&quot;) and eccentricity (e).

== List ==


This list includes all numbered trans-Neptunian objects with a semi-major axis greater than 30.1 astronomical units (AU), Neptune&#x27;s average orbital distance from the Sun. The data is sourced from MPC&#x27;s &quot;List of Trans Neptunian Objects&quot;, &quot;List Of Centaurs and Scattered-Disk Objects&quot;, and &quot;List of Neptune Trojans&quot;, completed with remarks and information from Johnston&#x27;s Archive (diameter, class, binary, albedo, spectral taxonomy and B–R color index).

== Unnumbered TNOs ==

There are more than 3,000 unnumbered trans-Neptunian objects, defined here as minor planets with a semi-major axis larger than 30.1 AU (Neptune&#x27;s average orbital distance from the Sun). The data is sourced from MPC&#x27;s &quot;List of Trans Neptunian Objects&quot; and &quot;List Of Centaurs and Scattered-Disk Objects&quot;, completed with information from Johnston&#x27;s Archive (diameter, class, binary status, etc.). For the list of numbered TNOs, &quot;see &quot;.

== Trans-Neptunian satellites ==
A growing number of TNOs are revealed to be binary systems with a minor-planet moon orbiting its primary. There are also several multiple systems with more than one satellite.
== Diagram: orbital classes ==

Trans-Neptunian objects colorized by their orbital subclass and plotted in the orbital parameter space (eccentricity and inclination versus semi-major axis). The plot for the entire region contains 1418 objects including plutinos (#185), twotinos (#36), other resonant objects (#124), cubewanos (#420), inner (#40) and outer classical objects (#6), SDOs (#289), sednoids (#11), centaurs (#101) and other TNOs (#206).

<text>Aigio, also written as &quot;Aeghion, Aegion, Aegio, Egio&quot; (, ; ), is a town and a former municipality in Achaea, West Greece, on the Peloponnese. Since the 2011 local government reform, it is part of the municipality Aigialeia, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.

Aigio is the second largest city in Achaea after Patras. The municipal unit has an area of 151.101 km2. It has a population of around 26,000 while the municipality has about 49,000 inhabitants. Aigio is a port town on the Gulf of Corinth, and takes its name from the ancient city of Aegium.

==Geography==
The southwestern part of the municipality consists of the foothills of Panachaiko mountain. The river Selinountas flows into the Gulf of Corinth in Valimitika, 5 km east of Aigio town centre.

==History==
===Antiquity===

Before the founding of the city, the area had a Neolithic settlement. The city of Aigion was founded during Homeric times and became part of the first Achaean League since around 800 BC. The city had several Olympic winners, including Xenophon, Ladas (stadion race), Athenodorus (Αθηνόδωρος, stadion race), Straton (Στράτων, pancration and wrestling).

After the disaster of Helike, which was destroyed by an earthquake and buried by a tsunami in 373 BC, Aigion took the territory of the neighbouring city. The ruins of Helike were discovered in 2000 off the coast in the Corinthian Gulf. They are sometimes associated with Plato&#x27;s Atlantis myth. Archeologists are excavating the site.

From 330 BC, Aigion was for fifty years under the Kingdom of Macedon. Around the year 275 BC, the people expelled the Macedonian garrison and the city joined the new Achaean League. With the famous temple of Zeus Homarios, Aigion became the Achaean assembly place. It remained their capital until the Roman conquest in 146 BC. After the annexation of Achaia, the Romans removed the wall of the city and Aegium lost its importance.

===Byzantine era===
After the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, Aegium became a part of the Eastern Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire. In 805 it was captured by Slavic tribes during the Slavic invasions. Probably between 9th and 13th century it was renamed to Vostitsa (Βοστίτσα). In the &quot;Chronicle of the Morea&quot; (14th century), it is first mentioned with this new name. During the following centuries, the name is found in various documents having different spelling forms such as &quot;Bostizza&quot;, &quot;Ligustizza&quot;, &quot;Bostitza&quot;, &quot;Bostiza&quot;, &quot;Vostizza&quot;.

Some scholars interpret the name as having a Slavic origin. The German linguist and Slavicist Max Vasmer gives two possible interpretations, one from the word *&quot;Voščica&quot; (cf. Serbo-Croatian &quot;Voščíca&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;] and &quot;Voštane&quot;, and Slovenian &quot;Vošče&quot;) and one from the Church Slavonic word &quot;ovoštь&quot;, meaning &quot;fruit&quot;. Dionysios Zakythinos, a Greek scholar of Byzantium, gives a similar interpretation, explaining the name as meaning &quot;fruit-bearing place&quot;.

Christos Coryllos, in his detailed &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, had given another interpretation. He writes that after the plague epidemic, numerous Avar or Slav shepherds migrated to this area. One of their leaders had the name &quot;Vostitzas&quot;, from whom the town later took its name.

19th-century German writer Joseph Baron Ow, in his book &quot;Die Abstammung der Griechen und die Irrthümer und Täuschungen des Dr. Ph. Fallmerayer&quot;, written in 1846, gives a completely different interpretation. He writes that the name &quot;Bostiza&quot; is a diminutive form (typical in Greek language) of the word &quot;Bosta&quot;, which comes from the French word &quot;Bastion&quot; (middle French Bastillon). From Βosta was derived the word &quot;Bostan/Bostani&quot;, which is common in the Greek and Turkish languages, and means garden (other linguists believe that &quot;Bosta&quot; is of Persian origin).

===Frankish and Ottoman era===
The city was captured by the Crusaders in the early 13th century and became the seat of a barony of the Principality of Achaea. In the early 15th century, it was conquered by the Despotate of the Morea.


In 1459 it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, which ruled it until the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, except for brief interruptions by the Venetians from 1463 until 1470, and from 1685 until 1715. The city was captured by Greek rebels on 26 March 1821, and was one of the first towns to be liberated from Ottoman rule.

In July 1822, at Akrata, near the town, a force of Greek fighters under Londos, Zaimis and Petimezas surrounded and attacked a group of 4000 Turks marching to Patras, after their defeat at the Battle of Dervenakia. Only a few Turks were lucky to escape when Yusuf Pasha sent ships to take them to Patras.

After Greek Independence, the town was officially renamed to its ancient name.

===Modern era===
On June 15, 1995, a serious earthquake destroyed many buildings and damaged roads in the downtown and southwestern sections, with a number of casualties. The earthquake shattered Aigio: small memorials are found throughout the city, with candles aglow day and night to remember the victims.

With drought heightening risk, the mountainous countryside near Aigio was severely damaged by the 2007 Greek forest fires. Climate change has increased temperature extremes and other fires have broken out in years since.

==Landmarks and sights==

*The church of Panagia Tripiti is a notable attraction. It is a national sacred shrine dedicated to the Theotokos, God-bearer or Mother of God, the Life Giving Spring. It is built on a steep cliff almost 30 meters high, near to sea, in a landscape full of cypresses and pine trees.
*The church of Panagia Faneromeni (inaugurated in 1914), which is the cathedral of Aigio, is the work of Saxon-Greek architect Ernst Ziller. The interior is decorated with paintings of Constantine Fanelis.
*The Archaeological Museum of Aigio is housed in the former municipal market of Aigio. It also was designed by architect Ernst Ziller and was built in 1890.
*Ypsila Alonia Square, the central square of the town. In the square there is the neogothic Tower of Ypsila Alonia, which now houses a cafeteria
*The beach promenade
*Plateia Agias Lavras is also a square in the centre of the town, and is lined with neoclassical houses and shops

==Transport==
Until May 2011, a ferry served the port of Aigio, connecting it to the north-eastern mainland city of Agios Nikolaos (not to be confused with the Cretan city of the same name). The ferry service was limited, with three ferries daily. The trip was 45 minutes long. In May 2011, the shipping company that operated the ferry announced that it was suspending the ferry because of financial reasons. In 2019 plans for an electric ferry were announced.

The port also has railroad tracks, but the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE) announced suspension of service in Aigio and across the Peloponnese in January 2011.

As of 2020, a new double standard-gauge railway line connects Aigio with Kiato and Athens. The new Aigio railway station was built at the east outskirts of the city. It opened in 22 June 2020, and a few days later it was inaugurated by the minister of transportation of Greece.

Roads serving the city are the A8 motorway (Athens–Patras) and EO31 (Aigio–Kalavryta).

==Infrastructure and economy==


Aigio, along with Patras and Piraeus, has been one of the main export hubs for Corinthian raisins since the 19th century. In the book &quot;Geography of Greece - Achaia&quot; (1903) by Christos Coryllos, it is mentioned that the area of Aigio produced 7.5-10 million Kgs of raisins and 600 thousand kgs of olive oil annually. Today the port is used as a fruit import hub for Chiquita Brands International, mainly for the importation of bananas.

A new 256 m-long pier northwest of the existing port was inaugurated on 7 August 2013. The whole project cost 8.6 million Euros and is intended to enhance trade and tourism opportunities for the city.

Aigio houses two branch departments of the Technological Educational Institute of Patras, the department of Physiotherapy and the Optics and Optometry department.
The Aigio General Hospital is situated a few kilometres out of the town and has a capacity of 100 beds. The Hospital performs the greatest number of laparoscopic surgeries in Greece, while more than 50,000 people are examined on a yearly basis.

==Sports==
Aigio has a football stadium called &quot;Municipal Stadium of Aigion&quot;, which has a capacity of ~7,000 (4,500 seats). It was built in 1951 and was last renovated in 1999. For many years Aigio lacked basic facilities for water sports such as swimming or water polo. A new outdoor swimming pool was completed in January 2018.

<text>Tuckerman Ravine is a glacial cirque sloping eastward on the southeast face of Mt. Washington, in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Although it draws hikers throughout the year, and skiers throughout the winter, it is best known for the many &quot;spring skiers&quot; who ascend it on foot and ski down the steep slope from early April into July. In this period, the temperatures are relatively mild but the natural snowpack — which averages up to in a typical winter — is still adequate to ski most seasons. The record-setting high winds atop Mount Washington scour a massive amount of snow from the surrounding highlands and drop it here or in the adjacent Huntington Ravine.

Thousands of people have been known to ski Tuckerman in a single spring weekend. Skiing is not limited to this time, but the avalanche danger, peaking from late December to early March, requires special training and experience to assess and navigate the ravine safely during the winter. Avalanches have killed at least 10 people in the ravine since the 1960s.

The ravine, whose name is often shortened to &quot;Tucks&quot; or &quot;Tux&quot; in comments and on commemorative materials is most easily accessed from the AMC Visitor Center on Route 16 at Pinkham Notch, via the moderate lower section of the Tuckerman Ravine Trail. This trail is maintained in winter and spring as a &quot;cat&quot; trail, and parallels the Sherburne Trail used for ski and snowboard descents. It is a elevation drop from the foot of Tuckerman to the lodge.

== Anatomy of the Bowl ==
Tuckerman Ravine has many different runs that span the bowl, all as steep as 40 to 55 degrees. From the base of the bowl, the run farthest to the left is known simply as &quot;Left Gully&quot; and is one of the easiest runs. Moving to the right, the runs are more challenging and steeper. More to the right, &quot;The Chute&quot; drops between two large cliffs that slowly narrow the run. Still farther to the right are the Center Gullies, which includes &quot;The Icefall&quot;, which is 55 degrees, and requires skiers to go off cliffs as tall as . Right of &quot;The Icefall&quot; is &quot;The Lip&quot;. It is an open run that averages between 50 and 55 degrees. &quot;Right Gully&quot;, one of the bowl&#x27;s easier runs, drops into &quot;The Sluice&quot; about halfway down, and averages about 40 degrees.

== History ==
The ravine is named after botanist Edward Tuckerman who studied alpine plants and lichens in the area in the 1830s and 1840s. According to the New England Ski Museum, the first recorded use of skis on Mount Washington was by a Dr. Wiskott of Breslau, Germany, who skied on the mountain in 1899, while the first skier in Tuckerman Ravine was John S. Apperson of Schenectady, New York, in April 1914. According to the Mount Washington Avalanche Center, the first known death associated with the bowl is a 15-year-old &quot;killed by falling ice&quot; on July 24, 1886; the first recorded death associated with icefall was in January 1936; the first death associated with falling into a crevasse was in June 1940; and the first skiing-related death was in April 1943.

In 1933 the Civilian Conservation Corps started to cut ski trails in the White Mountains, including the Richard Taft racing trail on Cannon Mountain, and later the John Sherburne Ski Trail on Mount Washington, which runs from what is today the Hermit Lake cabin down to the Pinkham Notch Visitors Center operated by the Appalachian Mountain Club. The headwall was first run by two Dartmouth students, John Carleton and Charles Proctor, on April 11, 1931, and was quickly followed by a group from Harvard who skied the headwall from the summit of Mount Washington for the first time. The ravine soon became an important site for extreme skiing in New England.

=== American Inferno races ===
Races held in the 1930s attracted large groups of spectators and skiers. Harvard-Dartmouth slaloms, Olympic tryouts, and giant slaloms all were held in the ravine in that decade. But the races that caught the imagination more than any other, the races that still are talked about by Tuckerman skiers, were the three American Infernos of the 1930s. Two years after the headwall was first run on April 11, 1931, by Dartmouth men John Carleton and Charles N. Proctor, the Ski Club Hochgebirge proposed a summit-to-base race on Mt. Washington, to be called the American Inferno, named for a similar race held in Mürren, Switzerland. The first race was held on April 16, 1933, and was won by Hollis Phillips in 14 minutes, 41.3 seconds. The following year&#x27;s race was won by Dick Durrance, who beat Phillips&#x27; record and completed the course in 12 minutes, 35 seconds.

In the late winter of 1939, several veteran skiers proposed a repeat Inferno top-to-bottom race due to the ravine&#x27;s deep snowpack. The 1939 American Inferno is remembered for Toni Matt&#x27;s split-second decision to ski a straight line from the crest of the headwall down through the bowl&#x27;s full run. A recent Austrian immigrant, Matt had recently won a number of downhill ski races, including the Sun Valley Open Downhill, the Mount Greylock No-Fall Race, the Eastern Downhill Championships at Stowe, the Hochgebirge Downhill at Franconia, and the National Downhill Championships at Mount Hood. At a 50-year anniversary party in 1989, Matt recalled his descent: &quot;I went right and then left and then right and then said, well, now is the time to straighten them out. So I did and I kept waiting. Finally I dropped over the Lip...So I schussed on top of the Lip, went over it, and by that time, you&#x27;re doing maybe 80 miles an hour and there&#x27;s no sense in turning, especially if you can&#x27;t turn well. So you say, well, you might as well go straight, you know, and hope for the best. So [I] went straight and hoped for the best.&quot; Matt completed his ski run in 6 minutes and 29.4 seconds, reaching a top speed of . After a leg injury, he retired from ski racing in 1951, but continued to coach and officiate internationally until his retirement after the 1980 Lake Placid Olympics. In 1967 he was inducted into the Ski Hall of Fame. A shortened course was run in the spring of 1952 (because of a cloud-shrouded summit) that started just above the lip of the headwall, and was won by Dartmouth&#x27;s Bill Beck.

<text>Lieutenant Alfred Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 13th Duke of Hamilton and 10th Duke of Brandon TD, DL (6 March 1862 – 16 March 1940) was a Scottish nobleman and sailor.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born at Shanklin, Isle of Wight, in 1862, the son of Captain Charles Douglas-Hamilton (1808–1873). His grandfather, Augustus Hamilton, was a son of Charles Powell Hamilton, himself a grandson of James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton. As a young man, Hamilton was commissioned into the Royal Navy, and held the rank of lieutenant. He gained the reputation for being able to dive under the keels of the battleships on which he served, without any equipment, reappearing on the opposite side of the ship to the amazement of his crewmates. In 1888, his fourth cousin, William Douglas-Hamilton, 12th Duke of Hamilton, persuaded him to leave the navy. By then, he was the heir presumptive of the Duke, who had no son.

==Inheritance==
There was a serious possibility that Alfred Hamilton would provide a good match for the twelfth duke&#x27;s daughter, Lady Mary, but such hopes were dashed in 1890, when Hamilton was partially paralysed by a rare tropical disease he had caught while overseas on his last tour of duty. Hamilton recovered and succeeded to the dukedom in 1895. 

While the new duke inherited all entailed property and assets from his cousin, as well as a £1 million debt secured on them, most of the unentailed Hamilton estates went to Lady Mary, who in 1906 married James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose. The properties that left the Hamilton family at this time included Brodick Castle on Arran, which had been owned by the Hamiltons for 500 years.

One property that did not leave the family was Hamilton Palace, the main family seat. The new Duke was also hereditary keeper of the Palace of Holyroodhouse. However, the Duke offered Hamilton Palace to the Royal Navy during the First World War for use as a hospital. Following the end of the war it was considered necessary to demolish it due to subsidence, blamed on the family&#x27;s own coal mines. Hamilton lived instead at Dungavel House, which had previously been a Hamilton shooting lodge on moorland close to Strathaven.

Hamilton was honorary lieutenant-colonel of the 4th Battalion, Highland Light Infantry.

He was also honorary colonel of the 6th Battalion, the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles).

Hamilton died shortly after his 78th birthday, on 16 March 1940 at the family&#x27;s property in Dorset, Ferne House.

==Family==
On 4 December 1901, at the parish church of Newton Tony, Wiltshire, Hamilton married Nina Mary Benita Poore, a daughter of Major Robert Poore. She was the founder of the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society. They had four sons and three daughters:
* Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton (1903−1973)
* Lady Jean Douglas-Hamilton (1904−1987)
* George Nigel Douglas-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Selkirk (1906−1994)
* Lady Margaret Douglas-Hamilton (b. 1907), mother of Anneli Drummond-Hay
* Malcolm Avondale Douglas-Hamilton (1909−1964) 
* David Douglas-Hamilton (1912−1944)
* Lady Mairi Nina Douglas-Hamilton (1914−1927)

Hamilton&#x27;s sons made RAF history by all being of the rank of Squadron Leader or above at the outbreak of the Second World War.

<text>Engineering management is the application of engineering methods, tools, and techniques to business management systems. Engineering management is a career that brings together the technological problem-solving ability of engineering and the organizational, administrative, legal and planning abilities of management in order to oversee the operational performance of complex engineering-driven enterprises. 

Universities offering bachelor degrees in engineering management typically have programs covering courses such as engineering management, project management, operations management, logistics, supply chain management, programming concepts, programming applications, operations research, engineering law, value engineering, quality control, quality assurance, six sigma, safety engineering, systems engineering, engineering leadership, accounting, applied engineering design, business statistics and calculus. A Master of Engineering Management (MEM) and Master of Business Engineering (MBE) are sometimes compared to a Master of Business Administration (MBA) for professionals seeking a graduate degree as a qualifying credential for a career in engineering management.

==History==
Stevens Institute of Technology is believed to have the oldest engineering management department, established as the School of Business Engineering in 1908. This was later called the Bachelor of Engineering in Engineering Management (BEEM) program and moved into the School of Systems and Enterprises. Syracuse University established the first graduate engineering management degree in the United States, which was first offered in 1957. In 1967 the first university department explicitly titled &quot;Engineering Management&quot; was founded at the Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&amp;T, formerly the University of Missouri-Rolla, formerly Missouri School of Mines). In 1959, Western Michigan University began offering the predecessor to the modern engineering management bachelor&#x27;s degree (titled &quot;Industrial Supervision&quot;) and in 1977, Western Michigan University started its MS degree in Manufacturing Administration, later renamed as Engineering Management.

Outside the United States, in Germany the first department concentrating on Engineering Management was established 1927 at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin). In Turkey the Istanbul Technical University has a Management Engineering Department established in 1982, offering a number of graduate and undergraduate programs in Management Engineering (in English). In UK the University of Warwick has a specialised department WMG (previously known as Warwick Manufacturing Group) established in 1980, which offers a graduate programme in MSc Engineering Business Management.

Michigan Technological University began an Engineering Management program in the School of Business &amp; Economics in the Fall of 2012.

In Canada, Memorial University of Newfoundland has started a complete master&#x27;s degree Program in Engineering Management.

In Denmark, the Technical University of Denmark offers a MSc program in Engineering Management (in English).

In Pakistan, University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore and National University of Science and Technology (NUST) offer admission both at Master and Doctorate level in Engineering Management while Capital University of Science &amp; Technology (CUST), NED University of Engineering &amp; Technology, Karachi and Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology have been running a Master of Engineering/MS in Engineering Management program. A variant of this program is within Quality Management. COMSATS (CIIT) offers a MSc Project Management program to Local and Overseas Pakistanis as an on-campus/off-campus student.

In Italy, the first Engineering Management program was established in 1972 at the University of Calabria by Beniamino Andreatta. Politecnico di Milano offers degrees in Management Engineering., among many other public or private (and publicly-accredited) universities belonging to the same post-secondary academic degrees&#x27; classification.

In Morocco, École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Rabat offers an Engineering Management degree (three years of study full time with a selective admission for Associate or bachelor degree holders). The degree offered is referred to locally as Diplôme d&#x27;Ingénieur and is equivalent to Master level degree. 

In Russia, since 2014 the Faculty of Engineering Management of The Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in Engineering Management.

In France, the EPF will offer, from January 2018, a 2-year Engineering &amp; Management major in English for the 4th and 5th years of its 5-year Engineering master&#x27;s degree. The final two years are open to students who have completed an undergraduate engineering degree elsewhere.

==Areas of practice==
Engineering management is a broad field and can cover a wide range of technical and managerial topics. An important resource is the Engineering Management Body of Knowledge (EMBoK). The topics below are representative of typical topics in the field.

=== Leadership and organization management ===
Leadership and organization management are concerned with the skills involving positive direction of technical organizations and motivation of employees. Often a manager must shape engineering policy within an organization.

=== Operations, operations research, and supply chain ===
Operations management is concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. Operations research deals with quantitative models of complex operations and uses these models to support decision-making in any sector of industry or public services. Supply chain management is the process of planning, implementing and managing the flow of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption.

=== Engineering law ===
Engineering law and the related statutes are critical to management practice and engineering. Engineering legislation makes engineering a controlled activity and an engineering manager must know which statutes apply to their practice. Codes of ethics can be enshrined in law. Professional misconduct and negligence are defined in law. An engineering manager must be licensed as an engineer and may have engineers, technicians and natural scientists reporting to her or him. Understanding how licensed engineers supervise non-licensed technicians and natural scientists is critical to safe practice.

An engineering manager must always use engineering legislation to push back against schedule pressure or budget pressure to ensure public safety.

=== Management of technology ===
Introducing and utilizing new technology is a major route to cost reduction and quality improvement in production engineering.
The management of technology (MOT) theme builds on the foundation of management topics in accounting, finance, economics, organizational behavior and organizational design. Courses in this theme deal with operational and organizational issues related to managing innovation and technological change.

=== New product development and product engineering ===
New product development (NPD) is the complete process of bringing a new product to market. Product engineering refers to the process of designing and developing a device, assembly, or system such that it be produced as an item for sale through some production manufacturing process. Product engineering usually entails activity dealing with issues of cost, producibility, quality, performance, reliability, serviceability, intended lifespan and user features. Project management techniques are used to manage the design and development progress using the phase-gate model in the product development process. Design for manufacturability (also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM) is the general engineering art of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture.

=== Systems engineering ===
Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering and engineering management that focuses on how to design and manage complex systems over their life cycles.

=== Industrial engineering ===
Industrial engineering is a branch of engineering which deals with the optimization of complex processes, systems or organizations. Industrial engineers work to eliminate waste of time, money, materials, man-hours, machine time, energy and other resources that do not generate value.

=== Management science ===
Management science uses various scientific research-based principles, strategies, and analytical methods including mathematical modeling, statistics and numerical algorithms to improve an organization&#x27;s ability to enact rational and meaningful management decisions by arriving at optimal or near optimal solutions to complex decision problems.

===Engineering design management===
Engineering design management represents the adaptation and application of customary management practices, with the intention of achieving a productive engineering design process. Engineering design management is primarily applied in the context of engineering design teams, whereby the activities, outputs and influences of design teams are planned, guided, monitored and controlled.

===Human factors safety culture===
Critical to management success in engineering is the study of human factors and safety culture involved with highly complex tasks within organizations large and small. In complex engineering systems, human factors safety culture can be critical in preventing catastrophe and minimizing the realized hazard rate. Critical areas of safety culture are minimizing blame avoidance, minimizing power distance, an appropriate ambiguity tolerance and minimizing a culture of concealment. Increasing organizational empathy and an ability to clearly report problems up the chain of management is important to the success of any engineering program.

Managing an engineering firm is in opposition to the management of a law firm. Law firms keep secrets while engineering firms succeed when information is deiminated clearly and quickly. Engineering managers must push against a culture of concealment which may be promoted by the law department.

Managers in an engineering firm must be ready to push back against schedule and budget constraints from the executive suite. Engineering managers must use engineering law to push back against the executive suite to ensure public safety. The executive suite in an engineering organization can become consumed with financial data imperiling public safety.

==Education==
Engineering management programs typically include instruction in accounting, economics, finance, project management, systems engineering, industrial engineering, mathematical modeling and optimization, management information systems, quality control and six sigma, operations management, operations research, human resources management, industrial psychology, safety and health.

There are many options for entering into engineering management, albeit that the foundation requirement is an engineering license.

===Undergraduate degrees===

Although most engineering management programs are geared toward graduate studies, there are a number of institutions that teach EM at the undergraduate level. Over twenty undergraduate engineering management related programs are accredited by ABET including: West Point (United States Military Academy), Western Michigan University (ABET-accredited by ETAC of ABET), Stevens Institute of Technology, Clarkson University, Gonzaga University, Virginia Tech, Arizona State University, and the Missouri University of Science and Technology. Graduates of these programs regularly command nearly $65,000 their first year out of school.

Outside the US, Istanbul Technical University Management Engineering Department offers an undergraduate degree in Management Engineering, attracting top students. The University of Waterloo offers a 4-year undergraduate degree (five years including co-op education) in the field of Management Engineering. This is the first program of its kind in Canada. In Peru, Universidad del Pacífico offers a five-year undergraduate degree in this field, the first program in this country. In Germany, ESB Business School offers a 4-year undergraduate program which consists of five semesters at ESB Business School, two mandatory internships, one is mandatory to be in another country than Germany, and also one mandatory semester abroad. In the annual applied university ranking of the magazine Wirtschaftswoche, the Engineering Management course of ESB Business School is ranked on place five of all applied universities in Germany. The magazine surveyed more than 500 recruiters in the German industry from which university they are most likely to recruit students and which universities satisfy their needs regarding experience in working with projects, multilingual education, and ability to communicate most.

===Graduate degrees===

Many universities offer Master of Engineering Management degrees. 

Northwestern University offers the Master of Engineering Management (MEM) program since 1976. The program is administered out of the Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences. Students take courses across different schools of the university such as McCormick school of Engineering, Kellogg School of Management, Farley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Segal Design Institute. Graduates students are admitted based on eligibility criteria that includes minimum work experience of 3 years. 

Missouri S&amp;T is credited with awarding the first Ph.D. in Engineering Management in 1984. The National Institute of Industrial Engineering based in Mumbai has been awarding degrees in the field of Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Engineering since 1973 and the Fellowship (Doctoral) degrees have been awarded since 2008.

Western Michigan University began offering the MS in Manufacturing Administration degree in 1977 and later renamed the degree as Master of Science in Engineering Management. WMU&#x27;s MSEM alumni work in the automotive, medical, manufacturing, and service sectors, often in roles of project manager, engineering manager, and senior leadership in engineering and technical organizations.

Cornell University started one of the first Engineering Management Masters programs in 1988 with the launch of their Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Engineering Management. The program allows students access to courses and programs in the College of Engineering, Johnson School of Management, and across Cornell University more broadly.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a Master in System Design and Management, which is a member of the Consortium of Engineering Management.

Lamar University offers a Master of Engineering Management degree with flexible content to adjust to diverse engineering fields, with core content that includes operations management, accounting, and decision sciences. 

Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (NSIT) New Delhi also provides M.tech degree in Engineering management. Admission to this program happens through GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) examination.

Students in the University of Kansas&#x27; Engineering Management Program are practicing professionals employed by over 100 businesses, manufacturing, government or consulting firms. There are over 200 actively enrolled students in the program and approximately 500 alumni.

Istanbul Technical University Management Engineering Department offers a graduate degree, and a Ph.D. in Management Engineering.

==Management engineering consulting==
Large and small engineering driven firms often require the expertise of external management consultants that specialize in companies where engineering practice and product development are key drivers of value. Most engineering management consultants will have as a minimum a professional engineering qualification. But usually they will also have graduate degrees in engineering and or business or a management consulting designation. It involves providing management consulting service that is specific to professional engineering practice or to the engineering industry sector. Engineering management consultancies, are typically boutique firms and have a more specialized focus than the traditional mainstream consulting firms, A T Kearney, Boston Consulting Group, KPMG, PWC, and McKinsey. Applied science and engineering practice requires a combination of &quot;management art&quot;, science, and engineering practice. There are many professional service companies delivering services in a consultancy type relationship to the engineering industry, including law, accounting, human resources, marketing, politics, economics, finance, public affairs, and communication. Commonly, engineering management consultants are used when firms require a combination of special technical knowledge, and management know how, to enhance knowledge or transform organizational performance and also keep any intellectual property developed confidential.

Engineering management consulting is concerned with the development, improvement, implementation and evaluation of integrated systems of organizations, people, money, knowledge, information, equipment, energy, materials and/or processes. Management Engineering Consultants strive to improve upon existing organizations, processes, products or systems. Engineering management consulting draws upon the principles and methods of engineering analysis and synthesis, as well as the mathematical, physical and social sciences together with the principles and methods of engineering design to specify, predict, and evaluate the results to be obtained from such systems or processes. Engineering management consulting can focus on the social impact of the product, process or system that is being analyzed. There is also an overlap between engineering management consulting and management science in services that require the adoption of more analytical approaches to problem solving.

Examples of where engineering management consulting might be used include developing and leading a company wide business transformation initiative, or designing and implementing a new product development process, designing and implementing a manufacturing engineering process, including an automated assembly workstation. Management engineers may specialize in the acquisition and implementation of computer aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) applications. Services may include strategizing for various operational logistics, new product introductions, or consulting as an efficiency expert. It may include using management science techniques to develop a new financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a hospital, planning complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as supply chain management), and shortening lines (or queues) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park. Management engineering consultants typically use computer simulation (especially discrete event simulation), along with extensive mathematical tools and modeling and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization.

==Professional organizations==
There are a number of societies and organizations dedicated to the field of engineering management. One of the largest societies is a division of IEEE, the Engineering Management Society, which regularly publishes a trade magazine. Another prominent professional organization in the field is the American Society for Engineering Management (ASEM), which was founded in 1979 by a group of 20 engineering managers from industry. ASEM currently certifies engineering managers (two levels) via the Certified Associate in Engineering Management (CAEM) or Certified Professional in Engineering Management (CPEM) certification exam. The Master of Engineering Management Programs Consortium is a consortium of nine universities intended to raise the value and visibility of the MEM degree. Also, engineering management graduate programs have the possibility of being accredited by ABET, ATMAE, or ASEM. In Canada, the Canadian Society for Engineering Management (CSEM) is a constituent society of the Engineering Institute of Canada (EIC), Canada&#x27;s oldest learned engineering society.

<text>Extreme skiing is a form of skiing performed on long, steep (typically from 45 to 60+ degrees, or grades of 100 to 170 percent) slopes in mountainous terrain. The French coined the term &#x27;Le Ski Extreme&#x27; in the 1970s. The first practitioners include Swiss skier Sylvain Saudan, who invented the &quot;windshield wiper&quot; turn in the mid-1960s, and in 1967 made the first descents of slopes in the Swiss, French and Italian Alps that were previously considered impossible. Saudan&#x27;s &#x27;first descent&#x27; in America was at Mt. Hood March 3, 1971. Early American practitioners include Bill Briggs, who descended Grand Teton on June 15, 1971. The Frenchmen Patrick Vallençant, Jean-Marc Boivin and Anselme Baud and the Italians Stefano De Benedetti and Toni Valeruz were among those who further developed the art and brought notoriety to the sport in the 1970s and 1980s.

The key North American skiers who popularized the sport include: Doug Coombs, Shane McConkey, Seth Morrison, David W. Kraft, Glen Plake and Scot Schmidt, known as The Extreme-6 and all considered among the top extreme skiers in the world during their prime.

Because of the extremely long, steep slopes, and dangerous terrain, single mistakes at the wrong moment by some extreme skiers have led to them being seriously injured or killed.

Extreme skiing in the U.S. took off in the mid-1980s after the movie &quot;Maltese Flamingo&quot; came out in 1986, and John Cummings’ book, &quot;Hallowed Be the Extreme&quot;, documented the lifestyle of extreme skiers.

<text>Nina Mary Benita Douglas-Hamilton, Duchess of Hamilton (née Nina Mary Benita Poore; 13 May 1878 – 12 January 1951) was a British peeress and animal welfare activist. She campaigned for humane slaughter.

==Early life==

Douglas-Hamilton was born on 13 May 1878 in Nether Wallop, Hampshire. She was the youngest daughter of Major Robert Poore and Juliana Benita Lowry-Corry; her mother was a daughter of Rear Admiral Armar Lowry Corry.

==Personal life==
Three years after her brother, Major Robert Poore, married Flora Douglas-Hamilton, on 4 December 1901 Nina married Flora&#x27;s brother Alfred Douglas-Hamilton, 13th Duke of Hamilton, at the parish church of Newton Tony, Wiltshire, not far from her parents&#x27; home at Winterslow. Together, they were the parents of four sons and three daughters:
* Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton
* Lady Jean Douglas-Hamilton
* George Douglas-Hamilton, 10th Earl of Selkirk
* Lady Margaret Douglas-Hamilton
* Lord Malcolm Douglas-Hamilton
* Lord David Douglas-Hamilton
* Lady Mairi Nina Douglas-Hamilton

Douglas-Hamilton was very proud of her father&#x27;s work in helping agricultural labourers at Winterslow and was philanthropic towards the group, but kept her gifts secret from all but the recipients. Another gift was sufficient to completely equip and furnish a home for nurses at Bo&#x27;ness, West Lothian.

She was a member of the Spiritualists&#x27; National Union.

===Animal welfare===

Duchess of Hamilton was a co-founder in 1906 of the Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society, with Lizzy Lind af Hageby, a society which set up three veterinary hospitals for horses during World War I, and campaigned against cruelty to animals including the use of animals in war. In 1912, she became a founder of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Vivisection, which went on to become Advocates for Animals. She also established Ferne Animal Sanctuary, at Ferne House in Dorset, the estate she and her husband owned. She compiled an illustrated book related to the sanctuary called &quot;Chronicles of Ferne&quot;, published in 1951. At the beginning of the Second World War she opposed pet-culling that was being encouraged by civil defence authorities, that led to what became known as the &quot;British pet massacre&quot; in 1939 and 1940, and caused her to shelter many cats at Ferne.

Douglas-Hamilton was an advocate of humane slaughter. She campaigned for &quot;human killers&quot; and opposed the use of the knife and poleaxe in the slaughterhouse. In 1925, it was reported that she had witnessed 52 animals being slaughtered in a single afternoon in pursuance of the statutory use of the humane killer.

Douglas-Hamilton was chief promoter of the Animal Defence Society&#x27;s &quot;Model Humane Abattoir&quot;, established in Letchworth in 1928. The humane abattoir received many donations. On creation of the humane abattoir, Douglas-Hamilton commented that &quot;in a civilized country, a slaughterhouse need not be a place of horror, into which animals are driven by kicks and tail-twistings. We ask for mercy to animals, for decency, for cleanliness, and, above all a swift and painless death&quot;. Douglas-Hamilton was a vegetarian in her personal life but in 1928 became the head of a humane butcher&#x27;s shop. In 1931, she stated that &quot;we should ask for the first step to needful reform. This is the use in every slaughterhouse of the mechanically operated humane killer, through which death is made swift and painless&quot;.

In May 1950, she opened a maternity home for cats at her Dorset home, where she looked after 40 cats that were mostly strays. In June 1950, she attended an international animal welfare conference at Genova. She was a member of the Council of Justice to Animals (Humane Slaughter Association).

==Death==
Douglas-Hamilton refused to be operated on for a throat condition due to her opinions on medical research, and when the condition worsened, she refused antibiotics. The condition led to her death on 12 January 1951, at her London house. The funeral service was held in Salisbury Cathedral and the burial was at Berwick St John, near Shaftesbury.

==Legacy==
A Princess Coronation Class steam locomotive was named after her, which is on static display at the National Railway Museum, York. The Duchess Nina Institute in the village of Quarter, near Hamilton, Scotland, was a gift to the villagers by the Duke and Duchess of Hamilton and was formally opened on 24 September 1910.

<text>An autoresponder is a computer program that automatically answers e-mail sent to it. They can be very simple or quite complex.

The first autoresponders were created within mail transfer agents that found they could not deliver an e-mail to a given address. These create bounce messages such as &quot;your e-mail could not be delivered because...&quot; type responses. Today&#x27;s autoresponders need to be careful to not generate e-mail backscatter, which can result in the autoresponses being considered e-mail spam.

An autoresponder allows you to send email messages automatically to people who have elected to receive them (your subscribers). For example, if you&#x27;ve created a free report, a template, a guide, or other helpful piece of content, you can let your website visitors access it in exchange for their email address.

Such &quot;follow-up autoresponders&quot; can be divided into two categories:
* Outsourced ASP model – these autoresponders operate on the provider&#x27;s infrastructure and are usually configurable via a web-based control panel. The customer pays a monthly usage fee. This is easiest to implement for the end-user.
* Server-side – enables users to install the autoresponder system on their own server. This requires technical skills.

Autoresponders are also incorporated into electronic mailing list software, to confirm subscriptions, unsubscriptions, posts, and other list activities. Popular email clients such as Microsoft Outlook and Gmail contain features to allow users to create autoresponses.

==Autoresponder sequence==
They are used with autoresponders being used as part of a mailing list manager. These are used by marketers to deliver a queued sequence of messages to mailing list subscribers. Messages are sent relative to the date of subscription to the list or within single list systems, opt-ins that result in the addition of new mailing list tags. However, the length of the sequence for a user should be chosen such that it could be sufficient to accomplish one&#x27;s goal.

<doc id="551402" wikidata="Q750098" url="?curid=551402" title="Aston Webb">
<text>Sir Aston Webb, (22 May 1849 – 21 August 1930) was a British architect who designed the principal facade of Buckingham Palace and the main building of the Victoria and Albert Museum, among other major works around England, many of them in partnership with Ingress Bell. He was president of the Royal Academy from 1919 to 1924. He was also the founding chairman of the London Society.

==Life==
The son of a watercolourist (and former pupil of the landscape artist David Cox), Edward Webb, Aston Webb was born in Clapham, South London, on 22 May 1849 and received his initial architectural training articled in the firm of Banks and Barry from 1866 to 1871, after which he spent a year travelling in Europe and Asia. He returned to London in 1874 to set up his own practice.

From the early 1880s, he joined the Royal Institute of British Architects (1883) and began working in partnership with Ingress Bell (1836–1914). Their first major commission was a winning design for the Victoria Law Courts in Birmingham (1886), the first of numerous public building schemes the pair designed over the next 23 years. Towards the end of his career, Webb was assisted by his sons, Maurice and Philip. Ralph Knott, who designed London&#x27;s County Hall, began his work as an apprentice to Webb executing the drawings for his competition entries.

He died, aged 81, in Kensington, London, on 21 August 1930.

===Honours and awards===

He served as RIBA president (1902–1904) and, having been elected as a full member of the Royal Academy in 1903, served as acting president from 1919 to 1924. He received the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture in 1905 and was the first recipient of the American Institute of Architects Gold Medal in 1907. He was the first chairman of the London Society in 1912.

He was knighted in 1904, appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1909; and appointed to the Royal Victorian Order as Commander in 1911, promoted to Knight Commander in 1914 and Knight Grand Cross in 1925.

In 2011, after being selected by local residents, a new traffic relief boulevard constructed in proximity to the University of Birmingham was named after Webb.

==Works==


One of his earliest works was built for the Six Masters of the Royal Grammar School Worcester in 1877. These almshouses are in the Arts and Crafts style, different from his later work.

In 1881 he designed North Breache Manor in Surrey. A small country house in the Tudor Gothic manner, but with Arts and Crafts detailing, it was one of the largest and most extravagant of his private contracts from this earlier period.

Webb&#x27;s first major work was the restoration of the medieval St Bartholomew-the-Great in Smithfield, London. His brother Edward Alfred Webb was the churchwarden at the time, and his association with the church probably helped the young architect get the job. In London, Webb&#x27;s best-known works include the Queen Victoria Memorial and The Mall approach to, and the principal façade of, Buckingham Palace, which he re-designed in 1913.

Webb also designed the Victoria and Albert Museum&#x27;s main building (designed 1891, opened 1909), the Royal United Services Institute, Whitehall (1893–95), and – as part of The Mall scheme – Admiralty Arch (1908–09). He also designed the Britannia Royal Naval College, Devon, where Royal Naval officers are still trained. He enlarged and sympathetically restored the perpendicular Church of St John Baptist, Claines, Worcester, finishing in 1886. Nearby he was also responsible for the new church of St. George, consecrated in 1895, which replaced an earlier smaller building in St. George&#x27;s Square, Barbourne, Worcester. With his partner Ingress Bell, he extended St Andrew&#x27;s Church, in Fulham Fields, London, remodelled the chancel, built the Lady Chapel, and designed the rood screen.

He also designed the Holy Trinity Cathedral in Accra, Ghana.

Other educational commissions included the new buildings of Christ&#x27;s Hospital in Horsham, Sussex (1893–1902), the Royal College of Science, South Kensington (1900–06), King&#x27;s College, Cambridge (1908), the Royal School of Mines, South Kensington (1909–13), Royal Russell School, Coombe, Croydon, Surrey, and the Royal College of Science for Ireland which now houses the Irish Government Buildings.

Residential commissions included Nos 2 (&quot;The Gables&quot;) and 4 (&quot;Windermere&quot;) Blackheath Park, in Blackheath, south-east London. He also designed (1895–96) a library wing, including the Cedar Library, at The Hendre, a large Victorian mansion in Monmouthshire, for John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock.

In March 1889 the consistory of the French Protestant Church of London commissioned Webb to design a new church. It was erected in 1891–93 at 8–9 Soho Square in London. The church is one of Webb&#x27;s Gothic school works.

In 1901 Webb designed the headquarters for a brewery at 115 Tooley Street, London, recently converted into 14 apartments as &quot;Aston Webb House&quot;. This was done as part of the development of More London.

Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray, commissioned Webb to undertake major extensions to his property, Dunecht House, Aberdeenshire, which were carried out 1913–20.

At the University of Birmingham (1900–1912), the whole of the original scheme, in the Byzantine style, was the product of the Webb-Bell partnership. This consisted of a curved building with five radial blocks. The central building of Chancellor&#x27;s Court containing the Great Hall is named after Aston Webb. The main feature is a large dome that sits atop the entrance loggia. The two radial blocks to each side were to be teaching blocks for various engineering disciplines; but the easternmost was not built until the Bramall Music Building was added roughly a century later. The scheme also included the straight run of buildings to the north completing the &#x27;D&#x27; shape. Originally these were the physics and chemistry departments, and the Harding Memorial Library. The scheme was set off by the free standing clock tower (&quot;Old Joe&quot;) over 100 metres high and the tallest structure in Birmingham until 1966.

Sir Aston Webb also designed the chapels of Worksop College, Nottinghamshire (1911) and Ellesmere College, Shropshire (1926), both of which are Woodard Schools.

<doc id="551409" wikidata="Q5428596" url="?curid=551409" title="Facilities engineering">
<text>Facilities engineering evolved from plant engineering in the early 1990s as U.S. workplaces became more specialized. Practitioners preferred this term because it more accurately reflected the multidisciplinary demands for specialized conditions in a wider variety of indoor environments, not merely manufacturing plants.

Today, a facilities engineer typically has hands-on responsibility for the employer&#x27;s Electrical engineering, maintenance, environmental, health, safety, energy, controls/instrumentation, civil engineering, and HVAC needs. The need for expertise in these categories varies widely depending on whether the facility is, for example, a single-use site or a multi-use campus; whether it is an office, school, hospital, museum, processing/production plant, etc.

== History ==
The term Facilities Engineer emerged in the 1990s from the already existing vocation of a Plant Engineer. This evolution occurred in order to match the rapid advancements in technology at the time. There was a need for a more specialized and dynamic type of engineer, while still having the general background knowledge and experience of a plant engineer or a stationary engineer. These skills consisted of, but were not limited to: mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, environmental engineering, civil engineering, business management, statistical analysis, communications, and effective supervision skills. The result of this development was a jack-of-all-trades engineer who takes their specialization into a facility and helps it operate unhindered at its highest level of efficiency. That is to say that a facilities engineer is quite simply a plant engineer placed into a position where they must utilize a certain set of skills based upon the necessity of the employer. This need generally calls for hands-on maintenance but can also include managerial or even supervisory responsibilities. While the purpose of a facilities engineer may seem straight forward, the large variety in facilities within different industries calls for a very broad range of training.

== Responsibilities ==
Facilities engineers have the responsibility of establishing different projects in support of the plant&#x27;s design and operation needs to be able to ensure an efficient and all the different aspects of safety are met up to standard. The industries that Facilities engineers can go into are the one that would typically require different plant layout plans, need organizational needs, and require different equipment and purchasing needs such as Health Care, Aerospace/Defense, and Energy/Utilities industries. They can also seek employment position such as operating engineer, a chief engineer, a facilities manager, maintenance foreman, or as a building maintenance supervisor. (learn.org) Facilities Engineers may be given management positions in the plants that they are working on to supervise the other facilities engineers and their license requirements, equipment provided, and getting the rights vendors hired to be able to meet the needs for the plant or facility. When working on certain projects, facilities engineers must meet the appropriate amount of resources such as hands and materials.

Due to the broad nature of a Facilities Engineer, the responsibilities utilized in one facility could be drastically different than in another. For example, a facilities engineer working at NASA Ames located at Moffet Field, would be responsible for helping to oversee and assist specialists in building, renovating/modernizing, and preserving the facilities on the campus; the facilities engineering branch also includes architectural engineering, civil engineering, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, environmental engineering, and pressure system safety.

In short, the responsibilities entail any type of engineering support that goes on at the facilities&#x27; location in addition to the construction and renovation of the facilities themselves. While, a facilities engineer working for the Indian Health Service would be responsible to ensure that health care facilities and related support facilities are in a safe and functional condition. These skills entail civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering, as well as specialization in medical equipment, property management, and various aspects of engineering support.

Similarities lie in the maintenance of the physical structure of the facilities, while the differences are in regards to what machinery and systems are present within the facilities. This will differ based on the nature of the facility and its intended purpose. Other types of skills and projects can include inventive methods in order to increases in the energy efficiency of a facility. For example, a team of engineering and technical professionals and facilities engineers at Naval Base Coronado in San Diego, California successfully implemented a multipurpose solar power grid capable of providing enough power to sustain 935 homes per day, while also providing shade in their parking lot. This project ultimately provides greater energy efficiency, energy independence, and cost reduction for the facility in addition to contributing to and supporting renewable and sustainable energy.

== Careers   ==
Facilities engineering is a broad study of engineering that makes it difficult to put facilities engineers into one category of jobs. According to a survey by &quot;Buildings.com&quot; the most common career fields for facilities engineer are construction, project management, facility management, energy management, design, staff engineering and staff architecture. While the aerospace and green building sector are not majority of employment for facilities engineering, the two sectors have grown and recruited heavily for facilities engineer in recent years. Another thing to consider is that most facilities engineers do not stay stationary in their careers. The careers of facilities engineer usually start off with operations, specialization, maintenance, and consulting. Then after years of experience most facilities engineers pursue positions as director of facilities, energy manager, facilities manager, facilities maintenance supervisor, and facilities planner.

== Training ==
Due to a major advancement in industrial and commercial construction, in conjunction with a highly increased emphasis on energy efficiency, it is not uncommon for colleges and universities to have courses and degrees specifically allocated to facilities engineering. For example, in the late 1990s Purdue University created a graduate course with an emphasis on the various mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and control skills necessary to maintain and increase the efficiency of these facilities. These skills consist of: mechanical measurements, calculations, basics of HVAC, the piping included in systems and associated equipment, efficiency in electricity and power, induction motors and variable speed drives, electrical systems, wiring, and lighting. Since facilities engineering has such a broad scope due to its wide array of necessary skills, courses tend to include education and hands-on training in virtually every aspect of engineering. This includes principles from software engineering and basic programming and coding in at least one language. However, the main focuses of these facilities engineering degrees tend to be on HVAC and energy efficiency. Other methods of training are certification courses sponsored and offered by the Association for Facilities Engineers. The Association for Facilities Engineers (AFE) was created by the American Institute of Plant Engineers, which was consisted of a highly regarded group of like-minded engineers or aspiring engineers who shared a common goal. This goal was to create new methods in which facilities engineers, plant engineers, facilities managers, and facility supervisors could become more efficient and productive in their various trades. This in turn would not only benefit the prospective engineers and managers, but was also intended to help economically advance the industries in which these trainees work. These certifications help to train engineers, supervisors, and maintenance managers in accordance with the methods necessary to maintain and efficiently work in and/or run a plant operating based on modern technological standards. With all of this training facilities engineers are capable of working in just about any facility, which can come in some variety.

== Educational Requirements ==
Facilities engineers are not required to have at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree but most of them do for experience and it is not unusual to see many facilities engineers with master&#x27;s degrees in the given fields. They must have that degree in either structural engineering, mechanical engineering, or manufacturing engineering. Most employers require one to have 3–10 years of experience before they will consider someone as eligible for the given job. Depending on how skilled the job is. Licensure and certification are required by a lot of employers, consisting of a professional engineer license, an EPA certification and boiler operator license, and an EPA certification. EPA also was known as Environmental Protection Agency is in charge of protecting human health and the environment, and the certificate for Facilities engineer makes sure the person receiving the certificate is well aware of these dangers. Most importantly all Facilities engineers must be able to problem. solve, be able to communicate there verbal and written skills, know the building process of the specific job, and know the specific code requirements for the given job. Some facilities engineers can the bachelors in science degree and required license but they can also receive an associate degree applied in science for Facilities engineering technology.

=== Course Work Requirements ===
The subjects that a Facilities engineer is typically required to know is:
== Employment ==
Additionally the US Department of Defense (DoD) has created a Facilities Engineering career field as part of the Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics workforce. That career field is not limited to indoor environments. In the DoD, the field also encompasses Real Estate, Ranges and the management of Linear Structures such as roadways, fences, and pipelines. DoD offers three levels of certification for professionals in this field.

The licenses and level of education that come with working as a Facilities Engineer relates to different positions such as Mechanical Engineer, Civil Engineer, or working as a construction manager in major or minor projects.

The salary is dependent on position, degree level, and the number of years of experience. The median salary for a Facilities Engineer with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in FE (Facilities Engineering) is $72,093. Their annual salaries can range from $42,475-$120,801.

== Areas of Research ==

The research done by facilities engineer is involved in the energy sector. Facilities engineer try to find new ways in order to improve efficiency and save power for industrial equipment and buildings. This has pushed many innovations in the move to green buildings and energy storage. The green building movement has caused research into how to reduce energy waste in industrial buildings. Some of the innovations involve smart lights, thermal curtains, cool roofs, green insulation and rainwater storage. The goal of the green building is to make a building that is sustainable and has no negative impact on the environment. The energy storage research focus on innovating new equipment to store energy in off-peak hours and use during peak hours. These new innovations technologies range from flywheel storage to hydrogen production during off-peak hours.

<doc id="551421" wikidata="Q5620988" url="?curid=551421" title="Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower">
<text>The Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower, or colloquially Old Joe, is a clock tower and campanile located in Chancellor&#x27;s court at the University of Birmingham, in the suburb of Edgbaston. It is the tallest free-standing clock tower in the world, although its actual height is the subject of some confusion. The university lists it variously as , , and 100 metres (328 ft) tall, the last of which is supported by other sources. In a lecture in 1945, Mr C. G. Burton, secretary of the University, stated that &quot;the tower stands high, the clock dials measure in diameter, the length of the clock hands are , and the bell weighs &quot;. 

The tower was built to commemorate Joseph Chamberlain, the first Chancellor of the University (with the commemoration being carved into the stone at the tower&#x27;s base), although one of the original suggested names for the clock tower was the &quot;Poynting Tower&quot;, after one of the earliest professors at the University, Professor John Henry Poynting. 

A prominent landmark in Birmingham, the grade II* listed tower can be seen for miles around the campus, and has become synonymous with the University itself.

==History==

Designed as part of the initial phase of the Edgbaston campus by architects Aston Webb and Ingress Bell, the tower was constructed between 1900–1908, and stood at the centre of a semicircle of matching red brick buildings. The tower is modelled on the Torre del Mangia in Siena. The original tower designs were amended due to Chamberlain&#x27;s great admiration for the Italian city&#x27;s campanile. On 1 October 1905, the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; reported that Chamberlain had announced to the University Council an anonymous gift of £50,000 (the donor in fact was Sir Charles Holcroft). This anonymous gift was announced some two months later in the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; as &quot;to be intended for the erection of a tower in connection with the new buildings at Bournbrook at a cost estimated by the architects at £25,000. The tower, it was suggested, would be upwards of in height, and would not only form the main architectural feature of the University but would be useful in connection with the Physics Department and as a record tower. In 1940, Sir Mark Oliphant used the tower for radar experiments.

The tower remained the tallest structure in Birmingham until 1965, when construction on the tall BT Tower was completed in the Jewellery Quarter area of the city. However, Old Joe is still one of the fifty tallest buildings in the UK.

The asteroid 10515 Old Joe, discovered in 1989, is named in the clock tower&#x27;s honour. There is a superstition that if students walk through the tower&#x27;s archway when it chimes, that they will fail their degree.

==Description==
The base is solid concrete, square by thick, with foundations that extend below ground to ensure stability. Joyce of Whitchurch built the clock, the face of which is across, the largest bell weighs with all the bells together weighing ; the minute hand is long, the hour hand is across, the pendulum is long. The clock hands are made out of sheet copper. There are ten floors served by an electrical lift in the SW corner. The tower was built from the inside, without scaffolding, up to the level of the balcony. It is built of Red Accrington brick with Darley Dale dressings and tapers from square to below the balcony. Owing to its having been built from the inside it was not pointed and had to be pointed in 1914 and was subsequently repointed in 1957 and 1984–85. Its weight, solid brick corners linked by four courses of brick resists the overturning wind forces.

The original design for Old Joe is thought to have been based upon St Mark&#x27;s Campanile in Venice, the latter having served as the inspiration for Sather Tower at University of California, Berkeley. The final design is thought to have been inspired by Torre del Mangia which is of similar design but for the clock being placed towards the bottom of the tower. 

David Lodge&#x27;s novel &quot;Changing Places&quot; tells the story of exchange of professors between the universities of Rummidge and Euphoric State, Plotinus (thinly disguised fictional versions of Birmingham and Berkeley), which in the book both have replicas of the Leaning Tower of Pisa on campus.

<text>The Saturn IB (also known as the uprated Saturn I) was an American launch vehicle commissioned by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for the Apollo program. It uprated the Saturn I by replacing the S-IV second stage (, 43,380,000 lb-sec total impulse), with the S-IVB (, 96,000,000 lb-sec total impulse). The S-IB first stage also increased the S-I baseline&#x27;s thrust from to and propellant load by 3.1%. This increased the Saturn I&#x27;s low Earth orbit payload capability from to , enough for early flight tests of a half-fueled Apollo command and service module (CSM) or a fully fueled Apollo Lunar Module (LM), before the larger Saturn V needed for lunar flight was ready.

By sharing the S-IVB upper stage, the Saturn IB and Saturn V provided a common interface to the Apollo spacecraft. The only major difference was that the S-IVB on the Saturn V burned only part of its propellant to achieve Earth orbit, so it could be restarted for trans-lunar injection. The S-IVB on the Saturn IB needed all of its propellant to achieve Earth orbit.

The Saturn IB launched two uncrewed CSM suborbital flights to a height of 162 km, one uncrewed LM orbital flight, and the first crewed CSM orbital mission (first planned as Apollo 1, later flown as Apollo 7). It also launched one orbital mission, AS-203, without a payload so the S-IVB would have residual liquid hydrogen fuel. This mission supported the design of the restartable version of the S-IVB used in the Saturn V, by observing the behavior of the liquid hydrogen in weightlessness.

In 1973, the year after the Apollo lunar program ended, three Apollo CSM/Saturn IBs ferried crews to the Skylab space station. In 1975, one last Apollo/Saturn IB launched the Apollo portion of the joint US-USSR Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). A backup Apollo CSM/Saturn IB was assembled and made ready for a Skylab rescue mission, but never flown.

The remaining Saturn IBs in NASA&#x27;s inventory were scrapped after the ASTP mission, as no use could be found for them and all heavy lift needs of the US space program could be serviced by the cheaper and more versatile Titan III family and also the Space Shuttle.

==History==
In 1959, NASA&#x27;s Silverstein Committee issued recommendations to develop the Saturn class launch vehicles, growing from the C-1. When the Apollo program was started in 1961 with the goal of landing men on the Moon, NASA chose the Saturn I for Earth orbital test missions. However, the Saturn I&#x27;s payload limit of to 162 km would allow testing of only the command module with a smaller propulsion module attached, as the command and service module would have a dry weight of at least , in addition to service propulsion and reaction control fuel. In July 1962, NASA announced selection of the C-5 for the lunar landing mission, and decided to develop another launch vehicle by upgrading the Saturn I, replacing its S-IV second stage with the S-IVB, which would also be modified for use as the Saturn V third stage. The S-I first stage would also be upgraded to the S-IB by improving the thrust of its engines and removing some weight. The new Saturn IB, with a payload capability of at least , would replace the Saturn I for Earth orbit testing, allowing the command and service module to be flown with a partial fuel load. It would also allow launching the lunar excursion module separately for uncrewed and crewed Earth orbital testing, before the Saturn V was ready to be flown. It would also give early development to the third stage.

On May 12, 1966, NASA announced the vehicle would be called the &quot;uprated Saturn I&quot;, at the same time the &quot;lunar excursion module&quot; was renamed the lunar module. However, the &quot;uprated Saturn I&quot; terminology was reverted to Saturn IB on December 2, 1967.

By the time it was developed, the Saturn IB payload capability had increased to . By 1973, when it was used to launch three Skylab missions, the first-stage engine had been upgraded further, raising the payload capability to .

==Specifications==

===Launch vehicle===
===Payload configurations===
===S-IB first stage===
The S-IB stage was built by the Chrysler corporation at the Michoud Assembly Facility, New Orleans. It was powered by eight Rocketdyne H-1 rocket engines burning RP-1 fuel with liquid oxygen (LOX). Eight Redstone tanks (four holding fuel and four holding LOX) were clustered around a Jupiter rocket LOX tank, which earned the rocket the nickname &quot;Cluster&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;. The four outboard engines were mounted on gimbals, allowing them to be steered to control the rocket. Eight fins surrounding the base thrust structure provided aerodynamic stability and control.

&quot;Data from:&quot;

===S-IVB second stage===
The S-IVB was built by the Douglas Aircraft Company at Huntington Beach, California. The S-IVB-200 model was similar to the S-IVB-500 third stage used on the Saturn V, with the exception of the interstage adapter, smaller auxiliary propulsion control modules, and lack of on-orbit engine restart capability. It was powered by a single Rocketdyne J-2 engine. The fuel and oxidizer tanks shared a common bulkhead, which saved about ten tons of weight and reduced vehicle length over ten feet.

==Instrument unit==
IBM built the instrument unit at the Space Systems Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Located at the top of the S-IVB stage, it consisted of a Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC), an inertial platform, accelerometers, a tracking, telemetry and command system and associated environmental controls. It controlled the entire rocket from just before liftoff until battery depletion. Like other rocket guidance systems, it maintained its state vector (position and velocity estimates) by integrating accelerometer measurements, sent firing and steering commands to the main engines and auxiliary thrusters, and fired the appropriate ordnance and solid rocket motors during staging and payload separation events.

As with other rockets, a completely independent and redundant range safety system could be invoked by ground radio command to terminate thrust and to destroy the vehicle should it malfunction and threaten people or property on the ground. In the Saturn IB and V, the range safety system was permanently disabled by ground command after safely reaching orbit. This was done to ensure that the S-IVB stage would not inadvertently rupture and create a cloud of debris in orbit that could endanger the crew of the Apollo CSM.

==Launch sequence events==
Acceleration of the Saturn IB increased from 1.24 G at liftoff to a maximum of 4.35 G at the end of the S-IB stage burn, and increased again from 0 G to 2.85 G from stage separation to the end of the S-IVB burn.

AS-206, 207, and 208 inserted the Command and Service Module in a elliptical orbit which was co-planar with the Skylab one. The SPS engine of the Command and Service Module was used at orbit apogee to achieve a Hohmann transfer to the Skylab orbit at .

==Saturn IB vehicles and launches==
The first five Saturn IB launches for the Apollo program were made from LC-34 and LC-37, Cape Kennedy Air Force Station.

The Saturn IB was used between 1973 and 1975 for three crewed Skylab flights, and one Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight. This final production run did not have alternating black and white S-IB stage tanks, or vertical stripes on the S-IVB aft tank skirt, which were present on the earlier vehicles. Since LC-34 and 37 were inactive by then, these launches utilized Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s LC-39B. Mobile Launcher Platform No. 1 was modified, adding an elevated platform known as the &quot;milkstool&quot; to accommodate the height differential between the Saturn IB and the much larger Saturn V. This enabled alignment of the Launch Umbilical Tower&#x27;s access arms to accommodate crew access, fueling, and ground electrical connections for the Apollo spacecraft and S-IVB upper stage. The tower&#x27;s second stage access arms were modified to service the S-IB first stage.



For earlier launches of vehicles in the Saturn I series, see the list in the Saturn I article.

===Saturn IB rockets on display===
As of 2023 there are two locations where Saturn IB vehicles (or parts thereof) are on display:
*SA-209 is on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, with the Apollo Facilities Verification Vehicle. Due to severe corrosion, the first stage engines and service module were replaced with fabricated duplicates in 1993–1994.
*The SA-211 S-IVB stage was mated with the Skylab underwater training docking adapter and Apollo Telescope Mount and is on display in the Rocket Garden of the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The SA-211 first stage was on display with a mockup S-IVB stage stacked in a launch-ready condition at the Alabama Welcome Center on Interstate 65 in Ardmore, Alabama, since July 1979. The structural integrity of the display, after four decades of weathering, could not be repaired. Dismantling of the vehicle for disposal began by September 14, 2023.

==Cost==
In 1972, the cost of a Saturn IB including launch was .

<doc id="551440" wikidata="Q7274785" url="?curid=551440" title="R4 (New York City Subway car)">
<text>The R4 was a New York City Subway car model built from 1932 to 1933 by the American Car and Foundry Company in Berwick, Pennsylvania. These subway cars were purchased for the IND Division. A total of 500 R4s were built, numbered 400–899, and arranged as single units. They were practically identical to the R1s, which preceded them, except that the R4s had a slightly different side door panel than the R1, adding small handle notches below the door window.

The R4s were used primarily for increased service in Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn. They served exclusively on all IND lines for most of their service lives, but were also used on the BMT Division during their final years. The R44s and R46s replaced the R4 cars, and they made their final runs in 1977. Four cars were preserved, and the rest were scrapped.

==History==
ACF built these cars between 1932 and 1933. The 500 R4s were numbered 400–899 to continue the R1&#x27;s sequence of numbers. The R5 contract order was for trucks and motors for the R4 fleet. In 1932, each new car cost $30,633 for the car body under contract R4.

The contract of subway cars was ordered to equip extensions of the IND in Queens, the Bronx, and Brooklyn. The R4s were used for service on the IND exclusively until 1972 or 1973.

Most R4s were retired between 1972 and 1973 as age decayed the cars&#x27; internal components, causing the cars to perform worse than their newer contemporaries. Many were replaced by the R44s. Other cars were salvaged and renumbered with number plates taken from retired R6, R7/A, and R9 cars and transferred to the East New York Yard. They ran on the Eastern Division until 1977, when they were finally replaced by the R46s. The last remaining R4, car 722 (renumbered 1398), made its final trip on the J on March 31, 1977, along with three R7/As and four R9s, marking the end of the R1–9 fleet.

===Experimental Refits===
* In 1946, 744 and 484 were outfitted with &quot;bullseye&quot; lighting and an experimental PA system.
* In 1962, 467 became the first of the first-generation IND subway cars to be retrofitted with sealed beam headlights.

==Preservation==
Most of the cars were scrapped after retirement. However, four examples have been preserved:
* Car 401 has been preserved by Railway Preservation Corp. and restored. This car contains two side doors that were previously used on R1 car 175, which lack the small handle notches below the door window.
* Car 484 has been preserved by the New York Transit Museum and restored. This car was one of the two cars that were outfitted with &quot;bullseye&quot; lighting and an experimental PA system.
* Car 800 has been preserved by the Seashore Trolley Museum in Kennebunkport, Maine. The car is modified with trolley poles and used in various trips at their museum, often coupled to R7 car 1440.
* Car 825 has been preserved at the Trolley Museum of New York in Kingston, New York. It is currently undergoing a full cosmetic restoration with a planned completion date for April 2019.

<doc id="551445" wikidata="Q11014749" url="?curid=551445" title="David Hanmer">
<text>Sir David Hanmer, KS, SL (1332–1387) was a fourteenth century Anglo-Welsh Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench from Hanmer, Wales, best known as Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s father-in-law and the father of Glyndŵr&#x27;s chief supporters.

== Career ==
After being called to the bar, Hanmer is recorded as having served as advocate in a case involving a breach of contract between a lessor and the lessee regarding the lessor&#x27;s failure to make proper repairs to the leased property. In 1376, Hanmer was appointed a serjeant-at-law. As a contemporary of Chaucer, a rough portrait of Hanmer as a serjeant-at-law may be found in Chaucer&#x27;s depiction of the Sergeant of the Lawe in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. In 1377, Hanmer was elevated to the position of King&#x27;s Serjeant. He served the Crown in that capacity as a legal adviser to Richard II and Richard&#x27;s government, represented the king in court, served as a prosecutor in criminal cases and a representative in civil ones, and held a higher rank and power in the lower courts. In his first year as a King&#x27;s Serjeant, Hanmer sat in Parliament with Sir John Cavendish and others of the judiciary in judgment on a case involving a grant of the late king&#x27;s grant to the widowed Countess of Huntingdon, said by some to have been Elizabeth of Lancaster, but was more probably the widow of the famous Guichard d&#x27;Angle.

On 26 February 1383, Hanmer was appointed the sole Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench. The position was one of the highest to which an attorney could aspire. From 1383 through 1387, Hanmer was summoned to and sat in Parliament as one of the triers of petitions in the House of Lords. Hanmer&#x27;s fellow triers included Thomas of Woodstock, Constable of England; Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich; Walter Baron Fitzwalter (d. 1386); and Baron Cobham of Kent (d. 1408). Other triers of petitions included John Bokyngham, Bishop of Lincoln, and Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford.

David Hanmer was knighted by Richard II in 1387. His name ceased to appear amongst the judges toward the end of that year, and he was certainly dead by 1388, pursuant to a deed of that year concerning his widow Angharad, Lady Hanmer, which names their son-in-law, Owain Glyndŵr, as the trustee for Sir David&#x27;s estate.

== Forebears and family ==
Following the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, last sovereign Prince of Wales, and the subsequent conquest of Wales, Sir Thomas de Macclesfield (b. 1242), an officer of Edward I, received a grant of lands in Maelor Saesneg (now part of the Wrexham County Borough). Sir Thomas and his heirs also received grants of lands near &quot;Cronemoss&quot; (Cronymoor) in Hanmer, from which the family eventually took its name. He and his successors married Welsh heiresses through whom the family acquired more estates in Hanmer, Bettisfield, Halton, and Pentrepant in the parish of Sylatyn, near Oswestry. Sir Thomas&#x27;s oldest son, Jordan, inherited family lands in Worthenbury, whilst his younger son, John of Upton (1277–1309), Constable of Caernarfon Castle, resided at and inherited Hanmer and was the first to use the family surname.

John married Hawis ferch Einion, a descendant of the Welsh rulers of mid-Wales; Hawis&#x27;s grandfather was Gruffudd (d. 1286) ap Gwenwynwyn (d. 1216) ab Owain Cyfeiliog, prince of Powys. Hawis&#x27;s paternal grandmother and namesake was a daughter of John Lestrange of Knockin, from whose family Sir David&#x27;s son-in-law, Owain Glyndŵr, descended. David&#x27;s father was Philip Hanmer (b. 1305), son of John and Hawis, through whom David and his famous son-in-law were distantly related.

Another familial connection between the Hanmers and Owain Glyndŵr was through David&#x27;s mother, Nest, daughter of Dafydd ap Rhirid ab Ynyr ab Ionas of Maelor Saesneg (&quot;English Maelor&quot;). Nest&#x27;s paternal forebear, Ionas, was an illegitimate son of Goronwy ap Tudor ap Rhys Sais, whose descendants, the sons of Tudor ap Goronwy of Anglesey, were first cousins and prominent supporters of Owain Glyndŵr. Thus, Sir David and his famous son-in-law were related by blood several times over.
David married Angharad, daughter of Llywelyn Ddu ap Gruffudd ab Iorwerth Foel of Pengwen, a landowner in nearby Chirkland. Angharad bore David at least four children: three sons, Gruffudd, Philip, and John (b.c.1362), and a daughter, Margaret, or Marred, (b.c.1370). All four of David&#x27;s children were most certainly Welsh-speaking, as well as fluent in French, and possibly, to a lesser degree, in English. David Hanmer may have had the wardship of Owain Glyndŵr when the latter&#x27;s father died in his youth. Gruffudd, the eldest, an attorney, was appointed by his brother-in-law as acting legal advisor to the Principality of North Wales; he married Gwerfyl ferch Tudor ap Goronwy, an aunt of Owen Tudor, by whom he had a daughter named Angharad. Philip, the second son, was also probably a lawyer. John was appointed to several responsible posts in the government of Flintshire; he married, first, Margaret ferch Dafydd ap Bleddyn Fychan, by whom he had a son, Gruffydd, from whom descended the Hanmer baronets; his second wife was Efa ferch Dafydd ap Goronwy, by whom he had three sons, John, Richard, and Edward. David&#x27;s daughter Margaret married Owain Glyndŵr, to whom she bore some nine children.

<text>A liana is a long-stemmed woody vine that is rooted in the soil at ground level and uses trees, as well as other means of vertical support, to climb up to the canopy in search of direct sunlight. The word &quot;liana&quot; does not refer to a taxonomic grouping, but rather a habit of plant growth – much like &quot;tree&quot; or &quot;shrub&quot;. It comes from standard French &quot;liane&quot;, itself from an Antilles French dialect word meaning to sheave.

==Ecology==
Lianas are characteristic of tropical moist broadleaf forests (especially seasonal forests), but may be found in temperate rainforests and temperate deciduous forests. There are also temperate lianas, for example the members of the &quot;Clematis&quot; or &quot;Vitis&quot; (wild grape) genera. Lianas can form bridges in the forest canopy, providing arboreal animals — including ants and many other invertebrates, lizards, rodents, sloths, monkeys, and lemurs — with paths through the forest. For example, in the Eastern tropical forests of Madagascar many lemurs achieve higher mobility from the web of lianas draped among the vertical tree species. Many lemurs prefer trees with lianas because of their roots.

Lianas do not derive nutrients directly from trees, but live on and indirectly derive nutrients at the expense of trees. Specifically, they greatly reduce tree growth and tree reproduction, greatly increase tree mortality, prevent tree seedlings from establishing, alter the course of regeneration in forests, and ultimately decrease tree population growth rates. For example, forests without lianas grow 150% more fruit, and trees with lianas have twice the probability of dying.

Lianas are uniquely adapted to living in forests as they use host trees, for stability, to reach to top of the canopy. Lianas directly damage their hosts by mechanical abrasion and strangulation, render hosts more susceptible to ice and wind damage, and increase the probability that the host tree falls. Lianas also provide support for weaker trees when strong winds blow by laterally anchoring them to stronger trees. However, this anchoring can also be destructive because when one tree falls, the connections made by the lianas can cause many other trees to fall. Because of these negative effects, trees that remain free of lianas are at an advantage; some species have evolved characteristics which help them avoid or shed lianas. 

Some lianas attain great length, such as &quot;Bauhinia&quot; sp. in Surinam which has grown as long as 600 meters (2000&#x27;). Hawkins has accepted a length of 1.5 km (1 mile) for an &quot;Entada phaseoloides&quot;. The longest monocot liana is &quot;Calamus manan&quot; (or &quot;Calamus ornatus&quot;) at 240 meters (787&#x27;). Dr. Francis E. Putz states that lianas (species not indicated) have weighed &quot;hundreds of tons&quot; and been a half mile (0.8 km) in length. One way of distinguishing lianas from trees and shrubs is their stiffness, specifically, the Young&#x27;s modulus of various parts of the stem. Trees and shrubs have young twigs and smaller branches that are quite flexible and older growth such as trunks and large branches that are stiffer. A liana often has stiff young growths and older, more flexible growth at the base of the stem.

==Examples==
Some families and genera containing liana species include:

<doc id="551450" wikidata="Q4086886" url="?curid=551450" title="Bioship">
<text>A bioship is a type of spacecraft or starship described in science fiction as either predominantly or totally composed of biological components, rather than being constructed from manufactured materials. Because of this, they nearly always have a distinctively organic look.

Bioships are usually quite powerful, and can often regenerate or heal damaged parts. Some bioships are intelligent or sentient, and some are considered to be lifeforms. Like most organic beings, many bioships contain large amounts of &quot;scaffolding&quot; materials to keep their shape, such as the xylem in trees or bone and chitin in animals.

==In fiction==
In the science fiction short story &quot;Specialist&quot; by Robert Sheckley, published in 1953 in &quot;Galaxy&quot; magazine, it is revealed that many galactic races are actually capable of symbiotic cooperation to become bioships, with each race forming a different part. Earth, apparently, is one of the planets inhabited by creatures that are supposed to function as FTL (faster than light) drives (Pushers), and, it is stated that all the conflicts and discontent of humanity are due to the fact that, while they have matured, they have nowhere to apply their true purpose. This story is perhaps the first mention of a bioship in science fiction.

In the 1966 short story &quot;Jonah&quot; (&quot;Jonas&quot; in French) by Gérard Klein, humanity uses massive (half a billion tons each) bioships called ubionasts (Units of Biological Navigation over Starways). The protagonist, a microgravity-born human named Richard Mecca, makes a living by taming &quot;snarks&quot;, ubionasts that went out of control for some reason.

Volume 322 of the German &quot;Perry Rhodan&quot; magazine series, first published in November 1967, marks another very early appearance of the bioship concept in science fiction. The Dolans are powerful bioengineered combat spaceships that are grown from the same synthetic genetic material as their extraterrestrial commanders. Different types of bioships are a recurrent feature in later stages of the Perry Rhodan universe.

&quot;The Night&#x27;s Dawn Trilogy&quot;: the Edenist Voidhawk and Mercenary Blackhawk are both advanced bioships (the latter being a genetic tailoring for combat of the former). Both types employ mental bonding to the captain. In the case of Voidhawks this is done by both the craft and captain gestating together and maintaining mental contact during their formative years. Blackhawks however are purchased as eggs and are bonded to the buyer who will become captain when the Blackhawk matures.

In the first novel of Julian May&#x27;s &quot;Pliocene&quot; series, &quot;The Many-Colored Land&quot; (1982), the backstory of two races of alien refugees living in the Earth&#x27;s Pliocene epoch describes their hard landing in a bioship. The bioship was emotionally bonded to one of the aliens (the &quot;shipspouse&quot;) and sacrificed its own life to safely deliver its passengers to the planet surface.

In J. Michael Straczynski&#x27;s sci-fi TV show &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, many of the First Ones used organic ships, like the Vorlon and Shadows races. Use of organic technology by these races signified their significant advancement over the younger races since their ships are very resilient, generate their own power, very maneuverable, have devastatingly powerful weapons (including variants that are capable of destroying planets), regenerate, and have a measure of intelligence.

In the popular science fiction franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot; several bioships appear. The &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Tin Man&quot; features a bioship as the main part of the plot. Species 8472 also has an enormous fleet of bioships which are able to go toe to toe with arguably the Federation&#x27;s most malignant enemy, The Borg.

The Yuuzhan Vong race in the &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot;&#x27; &quot;New Jedi Order&quot; book series use a fleet of highly resilient bioengineered vessels during their invasion of the galaxy, ranging from fighter sized &quot;coralskippers&quot; to titanic worldships that house their entire population. These ships often function on par with their technological counterparts and are difficult to combat, using highly unconventional weaponry and means of propulsion.

In the fictional universe of &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, an extragalactic race known as the tyranids (who swarm entire planets and consume all available biomass to reproduce and further spread to other planets) travel through the galaxy using giant organic bioships known as hive ships that transport the various types of the race inside. These ships travel in large numbers known as hive fleets and are often described as &quot;tendrils&quot; weaving into the galaxy from other galaxies they had previously devoured. Numerous hive fleets have been recorded in the 40K universe and have even been named, with the first recorded fleet designated as Hive Fleet Behemoth. The hive ships are described as serving their race as a whole and the individuals within a hive ship serving it as a single entity.

The Zerg alien race in the video game &quot;StarCraft&quot; traverse space via sentient, organic vessels called &quot;Leviathan&quot;.

&quot;Farscape&quot;&#x27;s Moya is a female Leviathan transport vessel; a living sentient bio-mechanical space ship, who was once captured by the Peacekeepers. She escaped captivity along with the people imprisoned on her by the Peacekeepers. She has given birth to one offspring, a male by the name of Talyn.

The series &quot;Lexx&quot; centers around the titular bioship, The Lexx: &#x27;the most powerful weapon of destruction in the two universes.&#x27;

In the last three installments of the novel series &quot;The Expanse&quot; the Laconian Empire uses powerful combat spaceships, that are grown rather than built. Unlike other bioships however, they are not fully alive but based on self-replicating technology that results in similar shapes as biological life.

In Jordan Peele&#x27;s sci-fi horror comedy film &quot;Nope&quot; (2022), a flying saucer-shaped UFO has been plaguing the prairies of Los Angeles County, California and abducting several horses and ejecting anything inorganic, disguising itself in a single unmoving cloud and deactivating any electronics with its an electromagnetic field. However, over time, protagonists OJ and Emerald discover that the UFO is not a ship, but an actual independent alien organism, or a unique terrestrial flying cryptid, whom they dub Jean Jacket. Despite its resemblance to a flying saucer, Jean Jacket is not an actual ship and hosts no alien crew but instead is eating all the creatures it &quot;abducts&quot; and regurgitating anything like metal or wood or inorganic, including the liquefied prey if it is unable to process it. Also, near the end of the movie, it unfurls into a flimsy but massive jellyfish-esque shape with a single square camera shutter-esque eye.

<text>Charles Kinbote is a fictional character who acts as the unreliable narrator in Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s novel &quot;Pale Fire&quot;.

==Academic work==
Kinbote appears to be the scholarly author of the foreword, commentary and index surrounding the text of the late John Shade&#x27;s poem &quot;Pale Fire,&quot; which together form the text of Nabokov&#x27;s novel. In the course of initially academic but increasingly deranged annotations to Shade&#x27;s text, Kinbote&#x27;s writing reveals a comic melange of narcissism and : he believes himself to be a royal figure, the exiled king of Zembla and the real target of the gunman who has in fact murdered Shade. Using the scholarly apparatus of reference and commentary, Kinbote first intertwines his own story with the commentary on Shade&#x27;s poem, then allows the poem to slide into the background and his perhaps delusional world to move into the spotlight; as Kinbote had hoped John Shade would produce a poem about Zembla&#x27;s exiled king, this shift provides some satisfaction for Kinbote.

==Zembla==
Kinbote&#x27;s &quot;distant northern land&quot; may or may not exist in the world of the novel. In one interpretation, Kinbote is in fact a failed Eastern European academic probably named Vseslav Botkin, teaching at the same university as Shade. Botkin is desperate for recognition, ridiculed by most of the staff. Shade alone feels pity for him and occasionally indulges Kinbote in long walks around New Wye, the college town where they live.

The concept of a land called Zembla originates in of Alexander Pope&#x27;s An Essay On Man, which includes the cryptic lines:

==Structure and &quot;Pale Fire&quot;″s author==
The novel&#x27;s reflexive structure, where neither Kinbote nor Shade truly holds the final word, coupled with apparent allusions to Kinbote&#x27;s story in the poem, enables critics to debate multiple authorship theories for Pale Fire. These theories include the idea that Shade created Kinbote and penned the commentary himself, as well as the opposing view that Kinbote created Shade. Brian Boyd&#x27;s book &quot;Pale Fire: The Magic of Artistic Discovery&quot; thoroughly explores the authorship and interpretive options, eventually settling on a thesis involving intervention in the text by both Shade and his daughter Hazel after their respective deaths. Mary McCarthy, in her 1962 &quot;New Republic&quot; essay &quot;A Bolt from the Blue&quot; (in which she classed &quot;Pale Fire&quot; &quot;one of the great works of art of the century&quot;), identified the book&#x27;s author as Professor V. Botkin. Nabokov himself endorsed this reading, including in a list of possible interview answers at the end of his 1962 diary, &quot;I wonder if any reader will notice the following details: 1) that the nasty commentator is not an ex-king and not even Dr. Kinbote, but Prof. Vseslav Botkin, a Russian and a madman ...&quot;

==Cultural influences==
*A character was named after Kinbote in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Jose Chung&#x27;s From Outer Space&quot;.

<text>The Volkswagen Corrado is a compact four passenger (2+2), three door, front-engine, front-wheel-drive liftback coupe marketed by Volkswagen from 1988 until 1995, and manufactured by Karmann in Osnabrück, Germany.

Designed by Herbert Schäfer, the Corrado overlapped and eventually superseded Volkswagen&#x27;s Scirocco model. 97,521 Corrados were manufactured over the seven year production run; about 50,000 of them were sold in the United States.

==Overview==

The Corrado is a three-door hatchback/liftback with a 2+2 seating layout. The Corrado&#x27;s floorpan is based on the A2 platform (i.e. Mark 2 Golf/Jetta) and, with the exception of VR6 models, all versions use the subframes, suspension, steering and braking components from the Volkswagen A2 platform model range. The body shell was built by Karmann and was partially zinc plated and galvanized, providing strong rust protection.

The VR6 uses suspension components from the A3 model range, including the rear axle assembly and some parts of the A3&#x27;s &#x27;plus&#x27; type front axle assembly. The subsequent wider front wheel track of the Corrado VR6 necessitated the fitting of new front wings with wider wheel arches and liners along with a new front bumper assembly. Together with a new raised-style bonnet to accommodate the VR6 engine, these body improvements were carried across the model range.

The Corrado is noted for its flush mounted windows and active rear spoiler – which raises automatically when the car exceeds ( in the North American market), automatically retracts at speeds below or can be manually controlled by the driver.

The name Corrado was derived from the Spanish verb &quot;correr&quot;, meaning to run or sprint. Prototypes were named Taifun (German for &quot;Typhoon&quot;) but the name was changed prior to release.

==Variants==
Launched in the end of 1988 (three years before the end of Scirocco production), all Corrados were front-wheel drive and featured petrol engines. The Corrado debuted with two engine choices: a 1.8 litre 16-valve inline four with (KR), and a supercharged 1.8 litre eight valve inline four, marketed as the G60 and delivering . 

The Corrado G60 is named for the &quot;G Lader&quot; with which it is equipped, a scroll-type supercharger whose interior resembles the letter &quot;G&quot;. Sales were initially slow, as the Corrado was considerably more expensive than the Scirocco it was meant to replace. Volkswagen United States stated that they had &quot;overequipped the Corrado&quot; when first introduced, leading to sluggish sales.

There were also two special models of the G60. The G60 Jet was an economy version for the German market only, thought to be a run out model before the introduction of the VR6. This model was only available in four colours and featured a colour coded interior. Volkswagen could not confirm production numbers for the Jet model.

Another variant is Volkswagen Motorsport (VWMS) Corrado 16V G60. Although the 16-valve engine combined with the original G-Lader was appreciated within the enthusiast community, the model never saw series production. It is generally believed that only two factory built examples were manufactured, both in Nugget Yellow.

Volkswagen introduced two new engines for 1992. The first was a naturally aspirated 2.0 litre, 16-valve inline-four, basically a further development of the 1.8-litre engine; this engine was never made available to the North American market.

The second was the 12-valve VR6 engine, which came in two variants: a 2.8-litre model for the United States and Canadian markets, and a producing at 5,800 rpm and at 4,200 rpm of torque version for the European market, fuel feed by Bosch Motronic 2.7 fuel injection. In the United States, the VR6 model was announced in October 1991 but only arrived during the 1992 calendar year and was marketed as the &quot;Corrado SLC&quot; (Sport Luxury Coupe). 3,500 examples were brought in for 1992; 1,500 leftover G60s were also sold after the SLC had been introduced.

Upon revising the engine, Volkswagen updated the styling with a new front grill and foglamps. With the introduction of the VR6 engine, the G60 engine disappeared from the North American market after 1992 and European market in 1993. The VR6 engine provided a compromise between both V-shaped and straight engines by placing the two cylinder banks at an angle of 15°, with a single cylinder head.

This design allowed engineers to fit a six cylinder engine into roughly the space previously occupied by four cylinder engines, while closely approaching the smoothness of a straight six design. 1994 was the last model year of the Corrado in the United States.

A lower cost, 2.0-litre 8-valve model with was produced for Europe from 1993 until 1995. A limited edition only for the United Kingdom, the Corrado Storm, was also sold. Some discreet &quot;Storm&quot; badging, a colour keyed front grille, an additional Storm badge on the gear gaiter surround (an upgrade from the standard Karmann badge), 15 inch BBS &quot;Solitude&quot; alloy wheels, and standard fitment of some previously optional items (such as the leather heated front seats) differentiated this model from the base Corrado VR6.

Only five hundred were produced: 250 in Classic Green with a cream leather interior, and 250 in Mystic Blue, a colour unique to the Storm, with a black leather interior.

An extremely rare special edition based on the VR6, named the Corrado Campaign was launched and produced in 1992. Only six cars were produced with just four cars surviving as of 2022. The Campaign model was unique with Dusty Mauve Pearl Effect paint and a red brick leather interior. They were built as a prize as part of a dealer incentive to sell the most Karmann-produced vehicles and all six cars were given to the top six dealerships in the United Kingdom as a bonus.

The Corrado was offered in Japan at Yanase dealerships that specialize in North American and European vehicles, offering the 1.8 L engine with either the automatic or manual transmission. The larger VR6 would have been considerably more expensive to tax, as the engine was over two liters&#x27; displacement.

==Reviews==
&quot;Auto Express&quot; magazine describe it as &quot;Regarded as one of VW’s best ever drivers’ cars&quot;. The VR6 model was listed as one of the &quot;25 Cars You Must Drive Before You Die&quot; by the British magazine &quot;Car&quot;, and &#x27;By far the most desirable version of the Corrado&#x27; by &quot;Auto Express&quot;.

In MSN Autos &#x27;Cool Cars We Miss&#x27; feature they listed the Corrado among the top eight &quot;Gone but not forgotten: a short list of cars once loved, still missed&quot;, describing it in the following manner: &quot;The VW Corrado VR6 is coveted because of its seductive styling, road handling capabilities and its role as trailblazer, introducing the VR6 to the American market.&quot;

In 1988, in the first incarnation of the BBC television show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, racing car driver and presenter Tiff Needell reviewed the Corrado in G60 form, giving it a positive review and stating that &quot;Handling wise, the Corrado is classic front wheel drive, and it&#x27;s really very, very good indeed.&quot; In November 2003, in Series 3 of the relaunched &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Richard Hammond identified the Corrado as a future classic, &quot;a kind of classic waiting in the wings... I think it&#x27;s really rather special... the result is fantastic,&quot; but countered with the comment that it &quot;was too expensive, and nobody bought it.&quot;

<doc id="551476" wikidata="Q1018659" url="?curid=551476" title="Edington, Wiltshire">
<text>Edington is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, about east-northeast of Westbury. The village lies under the north slope of Salisbury Plain and the parish extends south onto the Plain. Its Grade I listed parish church was built for Edington Priory in the 14th century.

Tinhead is the former name of the eastern half of present-day Edington, towards Coulston along the B3098 Westbury to Market Lavington road. Tinhead is labelled on the Ordnance Survey map of 1945 but not on the 1958 map. Today the combined settlement is Edington and the name survives only in Tinhead Hill and Tinhead Lane.

== Geography ==
Tinhead Hill, in the south of the parish at , rises to . The southernmost part of the parish is within the Salisbury Plain military training area. A stream that rises at Luccombe Bottom and flows north-east divides the parish from Bratton, then flows north-west across the parish.

Bratton Downs, a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, includes the hillside above the village.

Three miles away is the Westbury White Horse, a chalk figure on the side of Westbury Hill first recorded in the 18th century, which is visible from Westbury and much of western Wiltshire although not from Edington.

== History ==
Evidence of prehistoric activity includes a long barrow at Tinhead Hill.

The ancient parish had three tithings: Edington, Tinhead, and Baynton and Coulston. The parish was part of the hundred of Whorwellsdown and is believed to hold a place in English history, for it was probably here that King Alfred the Great won a decisive battle in 878 against the Danes at the Battle of Edington (formerly known as the Battle of Ethandun).

In the year 957 the Witenagemot, or King&#x27;s Council, met at Edington. The Domesday Book of 1086 records a large settlement of 67 households, held by Romsey Abbey and later known as Edington Romsey. After the establishment of Edington Priory in the mid-14th century, its manor later known as Edington Rector was created piecemeal through small purchases and gifts; the priory was also granted a manor at Tinhead.

Thomas Seymour, brother of Jane Seymour and thus uncle of the future Edward VI, acquired Romsey&#x27;s lands in 1539. Edington Priory was surrendered in the same year, and in 1541 its property at Edington and Tinhead was also granted to Seymour. After his execution in 1549 the former assets of both monastic houses were granted to William Paulet, 1st Earl of Wiltshire (later Marquess of Winchester). The manors remained in the Paulet family until they were sold in 1768. In 1784 they were conveyed to Joshua Smith of Erlestoke Park, and they continued in the same ownership as Erlestoke, beginning with George Watson-Taylor MP after Smith&#x27;s death in 1819. The estate was broken up and sold over several years after the death of Simon Watson-Taylor in 1902.

Another manor, which became known as Baynton, originated in the 13th century as part of Romsey Abbey&#x27;s holdings. The Victoria County History traces its many owners, culminating in 1842 with the Watson-Taylors. After the manor house – near the present Upper Baynton Farm – was destroyed by fire in 1796, William Long bought a house at Coulston and renamed it Baynton House.

The Stert &amp; Westbury Railway was built across the parish by the Great Western Railway Company, opening in 1900. A station named Edington and Bratton was half a mile (800 metres) north of Edington. The track continues in use as part of the Reading to Taunton Line but the station closed to passengers in 1952 and to goods in 1963; the station yard is a small industrial estate.

== Religious sites ==
Edington Priory was founded in the 14th century and became a monastery of the Brothers of Penitence, or Bonshommes. Its large church, which was restored in 1888–1891 by C. E. Ponting, continues in use as the parish church of St Mary, St Katherine and All Saints. It is a Grade I listed building. The other monastery buildings were destroyed by 1579; part of a fishpond survives.

A Methodist chapel was built in 1828 and a schoolroom added in 1876; it closed in 2006.

== Notable buildings ==
The Grade I listed house called The Priory, immediately north of the church, may incorporate parts of the monastic buildings. The property passed to the Paulets, Marquesses of Winchester after the Dissolution. Their tenants included Henry Baynton (from 1573) and Lady Anne Beauchamp (1630 to 1664); an inventory at the death of the latter listed more than 40 rooms. One range of that house remains, the rest having been demolished by a new owner, Joshua Smith of Erlestoke, in 1768. Two square projections with battlements are additions of c.1600 for the 4th Marquess. Around 1930, the porch was added and the interior was altered.

Also Grade I listed is a small 14th-century building set into the hillside over the Ladywell spring, about 400 metres south-west of the church. A conduit carried water to the monastery.

On Inmead, west of the church, are Whites Farm, a thatched late 16th-century timber-framed house; and The Grange, an 18th-century brick house with stone dressings, reputedly at one time occupied by Lavinia Fenton (1708–1760), a well-known London actress who was the mistress and then wife of Charles Powlett (or Paulet), 3rd Duke of Bolton.

The former George Inn on Tinhead Road was a coaching inn from the early 18th century, serving Salisbury–Bath coaches which ran through the village. On the other side of the road, Shore House is a much-altered timber-framed building from the late 16th century. Further down Tinhead Road, Beckett&#x27;s House has two parallel ranges: the front one incorporates a timber-framed house of c.1600 and the rear range is 17th-century.

== Local government ==
The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which performs all significant local government functions.

The population of the parish was 834 at the census of 1801 and 1,136 in 1841. It had fallen back to 714 in 1931 and in 1951 it was down to 579, partly due to the civil parish having been reduced in area in 1934, when an eastern strip including the hamlet of West Coulston was transferred to Coulston.

== Notable people ==
William Edington (d. 1366), from an Edington family, became Treasurer of England and bishop of Winchester, and founded and endowed the monastery at Edington.

William Gullick, the man who designed the New South Wales Coat of Arms, was baptised here in 1858.

== Amenities ==
The village is some six miles from the county town of Trowbridge, which, with Devizes and Westbury, provides shopping facilities. Edington has a village common and a public house, the &quot;Three Daggers&quot;. The parish church is the home of the nationally known annual Edington Music Festival.

Many children from Edington go to the primary school in the slightly larger neighbouring village of Bratton. Secondary school options include Trowbridge, Lavington, and Matravers School at Westbury. The parish had a National School, built at Tinhead in 1877; it closed in 1956 owing to falling pupil numbers.

<text>Fendt is a German agricultural machinery manufacturer founded in 1930 by Xaver Fendt in Marktoberdorf, Allgäu region, Germany. Fendt manufactures tractors, combine harvesters, balers, telescopic handlers and row crop planters. It was purchased by AGCO Corporation in 1997.

== History ==


=== Company origins and history to 1950 ===
The craftsman family Fendt traces its history back some 350 years. The family became well known in Allgäu for producing tower clocks, lead strings and violins. The family also farmed as a sideline and had a small trade in agricultural equipment. Johann Georg Fendt (1868–1933) took over his father Franz Xaver&#x27;s business in 1898 and began selling and servicing Deutz stationary engines.

Prior to 1928, Johann&#x27;s oldest son Xaver (1907–1989) was employed at Deutz and BMW, while Hermann (1911–1995) continued to help their father operate the family farm and the engine business.

In 1928, Xaver returned home, and he, his brother Hermann, and their father Johann extended their business into agricultural utility machines by building a motorized grass mower.

In 1930 they built their first &quot;Dieselross&quot; tractor (&quot;Ross&quot; being the German word for a horse of quality as opposed to just an ordinary horse).

In 1937, the company was listed in the Kempten (Allgäu) commercial register under the name &quot;Xaver Fendt &amp; Co., Maschinen- und Schlepperfabrik&quot;. Xaver and Hermann became shareholders; their mother Kreszentia acted as a limited partner.

In 1938, the Fendt brothers built the Dieselross F 22 with up to ; Dieselross tractors developed into a series that continued until 1958.

In 1942, the company faced great challenges as the Nazi government prohibited the construction of liquid-fuelled tractors as a result of the shortage of raw materials. In response, Fendt designed a wood gas tractor Dieselross G25, which had a standard generator and Deutz unit gas engine. They produced a total of 1,497 of these wood gas tractors between 1942 and 1949.

In 1948, the Fendt brothers were able to regain control of the company when they were established as trustees by the US military government that had been installed after World War II.

=== 1950s to 1970s ===
In 1950, production of the model F15 began, and the factory was producing 300 units per month. On 12 August 1950, the company produced its 10,000th tractor.

1955 saw the company produce its 50,000th unit.

In 1958 Fendt introduced their &quot;ff&quot; tractor series with the types Favorit, Farmer and Fix, offering engine power from to . The Favorit 1 was trendsetting in transmission design and build.

Fendt&#x27;s 100,000th tractor was produced in 1961; to represent that milestone, they selected a Farmer 2 tractor and painted it gold.

=== 1970s to the present ===
In 1970, Fendt created its first universal transporter loader wagon, the Agrobil S model. This year also marked the beginning of cabin production in Asbach-Bäumenheim, following the acquisition of Maschinenfabrik Josef Dechentreiter buiness unit there and the power of its 800 employees.

In 1980, a renaming to Fendt GmbH was enacted in order to meet the contemporary requirements for a commercial enterprise.

In 1985, Fendt achieved first place in the registration statistics for West Germany for the first time with 6,388 tractors sold and a market share of 18.4 percent.

In 1993, Fendt introduced the first tractor with a suspended front axle with the favourite 500C.

In 1995, the company introduced its Vario Class, featuring innovative gearbox (transmission) technology, making, it the world&#x27;s first large tractor with the stepless continuously variable transmission.

In 1996, the five heirs of Xaver and Hermann Fendt decided to sell the family business. At the end of January 1997, it transferred all shares of Fendt to AGCO. Since 1997, Fendt has operated as wholly owned brand of AGCO Corporation and its agricultural equipment reaches a global market.

In 2009, the Fendt 200 series was offered for the first time with a Vario transmission which cemented Fendt as the first and only brand of tractor globally that featured a continuously variable transmission throughout its entire tractor lineup; 70-360 hp.

In 2016, Fendt produced its 250,000th Vario transmission.

In 2018, Fendt had the largest share in the European tractor market. Fendt was the market leader by ownership in Germany with a share of 24.2% in 2018. In the annual image barometer published by the DLG, in which German contractors and farmers are surveyed about agricultural engineering companies, Fendt took first place in 2013 with 99.3 out of a possible 100 points.

CLIMMAR, an organization that publishes annual Dealer Satisfaction Index for nearly all Ag Equipment brands, has placed Fendt at an average measure of at least 14.1 in 8 of the last 10 years of survey (2011-2021) out of a maximum index of 15. The company is a member of the VDMA, Department of Agricultural Engineering.

As of 2022 Fendt showcases a product range that includes tractors, forage harvesters, combine harvesters, self-propelled sprayers, hay tools, row-crop planters, front end tractor loaders, and telescoping material handlers.

== Product range ==
Fendt currently offers the following types of equipment:

* a range of tractors from , the majority of which are produced in Marktoberdorf, Bavaria, Germany, and two models in Jackson, Minnesota, USA.
* A range of combine harvesters ranging from , are produced in Breganze, Italy.
* Forage equipment including forage wagons, tedders, mowers and rakes are badged under the Fendt brand after Fella was acquired by AGCO in 2011.
* Large Square Balers formerly Hesston branded, are now marketed under the Fendt brand since being acquired by AGCO.
* Planters for placement of row-crops

Finishing up the product line are:

* Forage harvesters which use Kemper headers
* Self-Propelled Sprayers
* tractor-mounted loaders
* telescoping material handlers or tele-handlers
* and tractors modified for the municipalities and forestry sectors.

== Technology ==

=== Vario Transmission ===

The Vario transmission was first developed in the 1970s, but due to excessive noise of the hydraulic portion of the transmission and lack of engineering production methods that had not yet been invented, it was not seen on a production tractor until 1995, when Fendt launched the revolutionary Fendt 926 Vario. This was the first ever stepless transmission to be launched in the tractor market, and is patented to be the only truly stepless transmission when it was first developed. Competitors were unable to make a transmission as advanced as a Fendt Vario at the time with a hydrostatic transmission as the only real competition, however, these soon fell out of favor. Since its initial announcement and release, manufacturers such as ZF, John Deere and CNH group have also developed their own versions of this type of transmission.

Fendt&#x27;s infinitely variable transmission (IVT) differs from a continuously variable transmission (CVT) as an IVT can be traveling at 0.0 km/h whilst the transmission is engaged and not in neutral. The IVT/CVT gearbox is widely regarded as one of the most fuel-efficient gearbox types on the agricultural market prompting nearly all other major manufacturers to develop their own system as it is able to combine more precise ground speed selection by the user with an increase in fuel-efficiency.

Variations can be found on other AGCO tractor brands such as Massey Ferguson. The gearbox may be the same however the individual brands have different controls/ joysticks and may have different ECU software.

The first generation of Vario transmissions were named for their primary inventor, Hans Marschall and the different classes of the transmission were labeled in honor of him using the format of &quot;MLxxx&quot; where the x characters would indicate how many kilowatts of power could be transferred through the transmission. (i.e. the original Fendt 926 Favorit Vario featured an ML200 Vario Transmission which could transfer 200 kW or 268 maximum horsepower through it)

=== Tractor Management System ===
In 2004, following the paradigm-shift of the Vario transmission, the next large innovation that Fendt delivered was the ability for the tractor gearbox/transmission and the engine to communicate with one another based on parameters set by the operator that allowed the machine to command only as much engine power as needed to complete the commanded task; a concept that was branded as Vario TMS or Tractor Management System.

=== VarioGrip ===
Fendt pioneered the idea and implementation of the first tire pressure monitoring and control system for use on an agricultural tractor. It was developed in the late 1980s and first released in an open-loop feedback system offering in 2015 on the Fendt 800, 900, and 1000 Vario Series tractors.

=== Fendt iD Low Engine Speed Concept ===
Beginning with the 1000 series tractor in 2015, Fendt created and implemented the use of the low engine speed concept which was also a world-first for any size agricultural tractor. While most diesel tractor engines operate at a rated engine RPM of 2000-2300, Fendt engineered the machine to work at its optimum between 1100 and 1500 RPM with a max RPM of 1730. The results from this innovation resulted in lower fluid consumption, longer service intervals, and longer overall machine life due to less component wear. With the success of Fendt iD on the 1000 series, it is also now utilized on the 900 Vario Gen 6 and newer series, the 900 Vario MT series, the 1100 Vario MT series, and the 700 Vario Gen 7 and newer series.

=== The Trisix ===

Fendt released a prototype of a new concept tractor at Agritechnica 2007, in Hanover, Germany, called the TriSix nicknamed &quot;Mobydick&quot; and boasting and six-wheel drive.

The front axle and the rearmost steer the tractor, and as the speed of the tractor increases, the amount of steering input on the rear axle reduces to make it safer. It also completely locks out when in transport mode and with some implements.

To handle the horsepower the Trisix has two of the company&#x27;s trademark Vario transmissions, which push the machine up to a top speed of 60 km/h (38 mph). Fendt has not confirmed the production of this machine, and it remains in the prototype stage. The axles and backbone tube are from Tatra 815 series trucks and the 6x6 Tatra-based tractor concept was patented in 1997 by Farma Josef Dvorak of Tábor, Czech Republic.

== Appearances in media ==
A Fendt 930 Vario was shown on BBC&#x27;s Top Gear, where host James May chose a 930 Vario. It was driven by The Stig round the Top Gear Test Track, and did a time of 3:28.4, the second slowest time round the track. The Fendt 930 Vario does however report a top speed of 37.5 mph, much faster compared to similar competitor&#x27;s tractors.

The Fendt 716 also appeared on BBC1 Scotland, on the program Countryfile, where world-class Fendt Driver, Steven Brown, of Inverdovat Farm, won the annual Scottish Fendt Ploughing Match, receiving a prize of £5,000.

Fendt tractors have appeared in the widely-popular &quot;Farming Simulator 2008&quot;, &quot;Farming Simulator 2009&quot;, &quot;Farming Simulator 17&quot;, &quot;Farming Simulator 19&quot;, &quot;Farming Simulator 22&quot; and &quot;Farming Simulator 25&quot; games.

<text>Rheinmetall Air Defence AG is a division of German armament manufacturer Rheinmetall, created when the company&#x27;s Oerlikon Contraves unit was renamed on 1 January 2009 and integrated with Rheinmetall&#x27;s other air-defence products. Oerlikon Contraves was a Swiss anti-aircraft artillery manufacturer famous for its adaptation of the 1916 20 mm Becker as the Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon design, which was used in the Second World War and remains in use. Copies and derivatives of these designs were made by German, French, British, and Japanese weapon manufacturers. Oerlikon Contraves was purchased by Rheinmetall in 1999.
, Rheinmetall Air Defence had around 1,050 employees at locations in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, and Canada. The group&#x27;s sales were about .

==History==
Oerlikon&#x27;s earliest predecessor was Schweizerische Werkzeugmaschinenfabrik Oerlikon, founded in the Oerlikon district of Zürich, Switzerland in 1906.

In 1923 it acquired a factory in Germany. It entered the anti-aircraft defence field in 1924. In 1936, it founded a purely anti-aircraft development company called Contraves (&quot;contra aves&quot; is Latin for &quot;against birds&quot;, better translated as &quot;anti-flying-objects&quot;) In 1989, the Werkzeugmaschinenfabrik Oerlikon-Bührle and Contraves merged to form the Oerlikon-Contraves Group, later renamed Oerlikon Contraves Defence. Oerlikon Contraves was purchased by Rheinmetall, a German armament manufacturer, in 1999, and renamed Rheinmetall Air Defence AG on 1 January 2009.

===Historic products===
American versions of the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, such as the Mk 4, Mk 10, and Mk 24, were used extensively from World War II to the Vietnam War. As anti-aircraft weapons used by the US Navy, they were frequently the last line of defence against kamikaze attacks. Most combat ships from aircraft carriers to PT boats were equipped with Oerlikon guns. During the Vietnam War they were widely employed by riverine forces as anti-personnel weapons. They remained in service until the 1970s, when they were replaced by the Mk 16 20 mm cannon.

Oerlikon also developed the following surface-to-air missiles: the RSA Missile, the RSD 58, and the Kriens RSC Missile.
Oerlikons 20mm cannon was frequently used on Naval Ships throughout the 1920s, 30s and 40s.

==Corruption charges==
Rheinmetall Air Defence (RAD) is one of six companies that were blacklisted by India&#x27;s Ministry of Defence in March 2012 for their involvement in a bribery scandal. The companies are accused of bribing the Director General of Ordnance Factories Board (OFB), Sudipta Ghosh. RAD and the other firms have been barred from any dealings with the OFB and all other Indian defence companies, as well as being blacklisted from participating in any Indian defence contract, for a period of 10 years. RAD has claimed that the charges against it are without merit.

Rheinmetall Air Defence was implicated in a corruption case in India along with arms dealer Abhishek Verma and his wife Anca Verma lodged by anti-corruption agency of India, the CBI in 2012 for bribing defence officials for securing multi billion dollar weapons contracts of the Indian military establishment. RAD Chairman Bodo Garbe and General Manager Gerhard Hoy were issued summons of the Indian courts. Subsequently a red-corner notice was issued for their detention through Interpol. The case at present is under trial in Indian courts.

<doc id="551482" wikidata="Q6139171" url="?curid=551482" title="James McBride (pioneer)">
<text>James McBride (1788–1859) was a prominent pioneer statesman in Butler County, Ohio. He was Hamilton&#x27;s first Mayor, and a prominent State Representative associated with the canals, archaeologist who supplied a considerable number of sketches of earthworks for early texts on the Mississippi Valley, Ohio&#x27;s leading pioneer author and antiquarian, Miami University Secretary and President of the Board of Trustees, Butler County&#x27;s fifth Sheriff, a surveyor, and an officer of other various entities. James McBride married the daughter of Judge Lytle, of the Lytle family of the Ohio River Valley, and was through her kinsman with Sen. Homer T. Bone, and Governor of Ohio Andrew L. Harris. McBride&#x27;s son in law was Roger N. Stembel, a commander of the Pacific Fleet.

McBride became an ardent convert to John C. Symmes&#x27; Hollow Earth theory, and wrote a book in support of it in 1826.

==Archaeological work==

As an archaeologist, he lived and worked near the Great Miami River, examining evidence of ancient life in the region. A canal engineer, J.W. Erwin, served as his assistant, making surveys of earthworks in the Great Miami River valley. McBride retained his own collection of artifacts. Artifacts and research by McBride was used by Ephraim George Squier and Edwin Hamilton Davis in the Smithsonian Institution publication, &quot;Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley&quot;.

==Legacy==

McBride Hall is a dormitory on the Miami University campus named in McBride&#x27;s memory.

<text>Angus McKinnon Young (born 31 March 1955) is an Australian musician, best known as the co-founder, lead guitarist, songwriter, and the only continuous member of the hard rock band AC/DC. He is known for his energetic performances, schoolboy-uniform stage outfits and his own version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s duckwalk. Young was ranked 38th in the 2023 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 250 greatest guitarists of all time list. In 2003, Young and the other members of AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Angus McKinnon Young was born on 31 March 1955 in Glasgow, Scotland. In the 1950s, Young&#x27;s father, William Young (1911–1985), his mother, Margaret (1913–1988; maiden name also Young), and his elder seven siblings lived at 6 Skerryvore Road in the Cranhill district of Glasgow in Scotland. Cranhill was a tough, working-class suburb with high unemployment.

Prior to moving to Cranhill, William worked first as a wheel boy in a rope works and then as a machine/saw operator in an asbestos/cement business. In 1940 William joined the Royal Air Force serving in World War II as a flight engine mechanic. After the war William worked as a yard man for a builder and then as a postman. Margaret was a housewife.

Young spent the first seven years of his life in Scotland. His siblings were Stephen Crawford (19331989), Margaret (1935–2019), John (born 1938), Alexander (1938–1997), William (born 1940), George (1946–2017) and Malcolm (1953–2017).

Music was part of family life. Stephen played the piano accordion and the piano, Young&#x27;s sister Margaret was passionate about music, John played the guitar, Alexander was an accomplished singer, bass guitarist and saxophonist who in the early 1960s left for a career in music in Europe, and George and Malcolm eventually became founding members of the Easybeats and AC/DC respectively. Stephen was the father of Stevie Young who in later years took over from Malcolm in AC/DC.

Young himself took up the guitar at the age of five or six, receiving one lesson from Alexander, after which he was self-taught. Young also learned how to fight on Cranhill&#x27;s tough streets, and, on one occasion was struck by a car.

Prompted by the worst winter on record in Scotland and TV advertisements offering assisted travel for families to emigrate to Australia, the Youngs flew from Scotland to Sydney, Australia, in late June 1963, when Young was eight years old. John migrated to Australia separately from his parents and siblings, while Alexander was the only child to remain in the UK.

Initially staying at Villawood Migrant Hostel (a site later developed as Villawood Immigration Detention Centre) in Nissen huts, brother George met and became friends with another migrant, Harry Vanda, a relationship that grew into their professional careers in music.

Young&#x27;s family moved into a semi-detached house at 4 Burleigh Street in the Sydney suburb of Burwood. Young attended Burwood Public School from 1960 to 1966 and in 1967, attended Ashfield Boys High School, dropping out at age 15. While at high school, Young enjoyed only the art classes. He practised the guitar in his bedroom after school.

After high school, Young worked at various jobs, including night shifts at a butcher shop. Then he became an apprentice printer. For one week, a soft porn magazine called &quot;Ribald&quot; moved into the print shop where Young worked. Young set some type for that magazine, but, despite some claims, was never its employee.

Young first started playing on a banjo, re-strung with six strings. Young&#x27;s first guitar was a cheap acoustic model purchased second-hand by his mother. After high school, and with a pay packet, Young bought his first Gibson SG second-hand around 1970 from a music shop just down the street from his home: &quot;I got out and got a Gibson SG that I played until it got wood rot because so much sweat and water got into it. The whole neck warped. I bought it second-hand; it was about a &#x27;67. It had a real thin neck, really slim, like a Custom neck. It was dark brown.&quot;

==Career==
Both Young and Malcolm were in a band with George and his music partner Harry Vanda called Marcus Hook Roll Band. The project released an album in Australia called &quot;Tales of Old Grand Daddy&quot;.

Prior to forming AC/DC, Angus Young played in a local group called Kantuckee. Kantuckee&#x27;s line-up included Bob McGlynn (vocals), Angus Young (guitar), Jon Stevens (bass) and Trevor James (drums). The band split and was later called Tantrum with the following line up: Mark Sneddon (vocals-guitar), Angus Young (guitar), Jon Stevens (bass) and Trevor James (drums).

Young was 18 when he and Malcolm formed AC/DC in 1973. Young was on lead guitar, Malcolm on rhythm guitar, Colin Burgess on drums, Larry Van Kriedt on bass guitar and Dave Evans on vocals. The band had a recording contract with Albert Productions; it had also produced the work of the Easybeats.

&quot;Can I Sit Next To You Girl&quot;, the band&#x27;s first single, was later re-recorded with Bon Scott as their vocalist. They decided upon the name AC/DC, suggested by their sister Margaret, who saw the letters &quot;AC/DC&quot; on the back of her sewing machine.

Young tried a number of stage costumes, such as Spider-Man, Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman named Super-Ang, before settling on his signature schoolboy look at the suggestion of his sister. To match this image the press and public were told that Young was born in 1959, not 1955. The original uniform was created by his sister Margaret and when it fell apart from wear and tear, he used his uniform from Ashfield Boys High School in Sydney.

AC/DC released their debut album, &quot;High Voltage&quot;, exclusively in Australia on 17 February 1975, along with a single &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; / &quot;Love Song&quot;. Over the next three years AC/DC cemented themselves as a popular hard rock act, especially in Australia, with the follow-up albums &quot;T.N.T.&quot;, &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;, &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; and &quot;Powerage&quot;. All their albums until this point were produced by Young&#x27;s brother George in partnership with Harry Vanda. Their 1979 studio album, &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, became their best-selling at the time and launched them to new heights of fame.

Months after this, Scott died from alcohol poisoning. Questions were raised as to whether the band could continue without him. Young and his other bandmates soon decided they should finish the work they had begun for their new album, so they recruited ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson to replace Scott. Five months later, &quot;Back in Black&quot; was released as a tribute to Scott. It quickly became a huge success, far outselling any of their previous albums, and going on to reach 22x multi-platinum in the US alone, and selling 50 million copies, the second highest-selling album worldwide, behind only Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;. AC/DC&#x27;s next album, &quot;For Those About to Rock We Salute You&quot;, cemented their position as the most popular hard rock act of the time.

AC/DC&#x27;s popularity declined with their next three albums, &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot;, &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; and &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot;. AC/DC looked as though they had reached their peak early in the 1980s and by the end of the decade were in decline. Malcolm Young missed the majority of the band&#x27;s 1988 Blow Up Your Video World Tour to address his drinking problem. He eventually became sober and returned to the band. During his absence he was replaced by his nephew, Stevie Young.

The band&#x27;s 1990 studio album, &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;, brought them back into the spotlight, reaching 5x multi-platinum in the US alone and selling between 10 and 12 million copies worldwide. Over the next 10 years AC/DC released two other studio albums, &quot;Ballbreaker&quot; and &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;, which confirmed their renewed popularity and success. After a lengthy eight-year hiatus, AC/DC returned with a new studio album, &quot;Black Ice&quot;, in 2008. &quot;Black Ice&quot; debuted at number 1 in 29 countries and was certified multi-platinum in 14 of those, becoming one of their most successful albums worldwide, and was followed by a hugely successful world tour. In 2010, AC/DC released an album of songs used for the &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; soundtrack they had put together; this reached number one in many countries around the world, including the UK, and number four in the US. Malcolm Young confirmed in 2011 that AC/DC were working on a 16th studio album.
In April 2014 Malcolm was forced to leave the band due to ill health, leaving Young the sole continuous founding member left in the band. In May it was revealed that Stevie Young, Malcolm and Young&#x27;s nephew, would stand in for his uncle to record AC/DC&#x27;s latest record. In September Malcolm officially retired and Stevie was made AC/DC&#x27;s official full-time rhythm guitarist. AC/DC released &quot;Rock or Bust&quot; in the fall of 2014. In March 2016, after the departure of both Malcolm Young and drummer Phil Rudd, AC/DC was set back with yet another departure; long time lead singer Brian Johnson was ordered by doctors to stop performing or face total hearing loss. Young, determined to finish what the band started, recruited Guns N&#x27; Roses singer Axl Rose to stand in for Johnson for the remainder of the Rock or Bust World Tour. On 30 September 2020, the band&#x27;s official Twitter account announced the pending release of a new album, &quot;Power Up&quot;, with the lineup of Angus Young, Stevie Young, Brian Johnson, Cliff Williams and Phil Rudd.

In 2003, AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the following year they were ranked number 72 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. VH1 ranked them number 23 on their list of the &quot;100 greatest artists of all time&quot; and number 4 in their list of the &quot;100 greatest artists of hard rock&quot;.

==Personal life==
Young is married to a Dutch woman named Ellen van Lochem. They own homes in Australia, the UK and the Netherlands.

Although a heavy smoker, Young is a teetotaler and has been his entire life.

On 24 August 2006, Young received &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine&#x27;s Legend Award from the editor, Paul Brannigan, who called AC/DC &quot;one of the most important and influential rock bands in history&quot;. On 16 May 2012, he was named the &quot;Best Australian Guitarist of All Time&quot; in a poll conducted by &quot;Australian Guitar Magazine&quot;.

==Equipment==
===Guitars===

Young has used Gibson SGs in various forms throughout his career. His original, and the basis for his current signature model, was a 1969–1971 SG Standard. One of his original SGs was given a lightning-bolt fingerboard during a repair by luthier John Diggins, and remained his most prominent studio guitar. His primary stage guitar is a 1967 ebony SG Standard. Diggins made at least one more SG for Young under his own &quot;Jaydee&quot; brand name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Angus Young AC/DC jaydee SG guitar&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two of his SGs, whether modified Gibson product or ground-up construction, circa 1977 and the Paris &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; tapings featured on-board wireless going to his amplifiers, the circuitry installed in a cavity routed into the back of the body. This practice was discontinued due to the potential for electrical shorts due to sweat, and at least one of these guitars was repaired and used for the &quot;Rock or Bust&quot; tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rig Rundown:AC/DC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson made a custom SG for Young with lightning bolt inlays to replace the Jaydee SG. Young&#x27;s &#x27;69–&#x27;71 SG has T Top humbucking pick-ups. Another 1964 SG, which he used on the recording of &quot;Ballbreaker&quot;, has patent # pick-ups. All of these are vintage-output Alnico II or V pick-ups with matched coils typically reading 7.5k–7.8k DCR. Beginning in 2009, Young started fitting Seymour Duncan humbuckers to all of his touring guitars. He uses Ernie Ball Super Slinky guitar strings (.009-.042) and Fender &quot;Extra Heavy&quot; picks.

===Angus Young SG===
Young and Gibson Guitar Corporation have collaborated to make the Angus Young SG. It features a pick-up designed by Young himself, the Angus Young Signature Humbucker, in the bridge position, and a &#x27;57 Classic Humbucker in the neck. The neck has &quot;lightning bolt&quot; inlays.

===Amplifiers===
Young mainly uses Marshall 1959 100 watt Super Lead Plexi heads and model 1960 AX and BX 4x12 cabinets with Celestion G12-65 speakers. Later amplifiers included Marshall JMP 2203 and most recently, Wizard Amplifiers. Early wireless systems, the Schaffer-Vega Diversity System that he began using in 1977, was also used as a compressor and a booster in his signal to &quot;fatten up&quot; his tone. Ever since adding it to his rig, it was used on several albums in the studio for chosen rhythm guitar tracks and all lead guitar tracks. Beginning with &quot;Rock or Bust&quot;, due to the discontinuation of the Schaffer system, Young began using a replica of the unit&#x27;s preamp with a commercial wireless unit from Shure.

==Influences==
Young has stated that he first began playing guitar when he was &quot;little, teeny. I would sort of dabble around five or six years old. That&#x27;s when I started hearing Little Richard.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;The Guitar Show&quot;, Young noted his influences include his brother Malcolm, Chuck Berry, Freddie King and Muddy Waters, while playing licks relating to Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, John Lee Hooker and the Kinks&#x27; &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;.

Young has indicated that he was also influenced by Keith Richards, as well as Chuck Berry&#x27;s performing style, including his banter with audiences and duck walk. When the band covered Chuck Berry songs in their early years, audiences would recognise the song, while noting their renditions were very different from the source material.

==Style==
Young&#x27;s playing style is influenced by straight blues playing in both the minor and major pentatonic twelve bar blues–type progressions. In AC/DC&#x27;s earlier recordings, power chords can be heard in songs such as &quot;T.N.T.&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;. He also utilises touches of Scottish folk in his playing, and pull-off arpeggios (pull-offs played one-handed) are a popular trick, appearing in songs such as &quot;Who Made Who&quot;, &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;, &quot;Sin City&quot;, and live renditions of &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;. In 1976, the band recorded an instrumental arrangement of the Scottish traditional song &quot;Loch Lomond&quot;, retitled &quot;Fling Thing&quot;, which has appeared in their stage act over the years. The title refers to the Highland Fling. Young occasionally provides backing vocals along with Malcolm on songs such as &quot;T.N.T.&quot; and &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;.

Young is famous for his wild onstage antics, such as intense jumps and running back and forth across the stage. Once, he would clamber onto Bon Scott&#x27;s or Brian Johnson&#x27;s shoulders during concerts and they would make their way through the audience with smoke streaming from a satchel on Young&#x27;s back, while he played an extended improvised guitar solo, usually during the song &quot;Rocker&quot; with Scott or &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; with Johnson. He frequently does his own version of Chuck Berry&#x27;s duck walk, as well as a &quot;spasm&quot; during which he throws himself to the ground, kicking, shaking and spinning in circles while playing the guitar. In earlier years he might remove his jacket and shirt mid-song as a form of &#x27;striptease&#x27; to the confused bemusement of the crowd.

Young was advised by older brother George that, if he ever tripped over his guitar cable, to keep playing and make it look like part of the act. Young also included a sort of striptease as part of a mid-show ritual, during which he slowly took off his schoolboy outfit, running across the stage to elicit cheers from the audience, culminating in a &quot;mooning&quot; gesture to expose his underwear, generally chosen with the colours of the local flag or occasionally offering a brief glimpse of his bare buttocks. He would then pull up his shorts, grab his guitar and play the remainder of the show topless. According to AC/DC video director David Mallet, although Young performs many of his trademark feats sometimes from a series of platforms, risers and ramps, he suffers from a fear of heights. This was discovered when Mallet chose to have Young lowered from a second story balcony onto a stage floor by wires for the video for &quot;Who Made Who&quot;.

<text>&quot;Do not go gentle into that good night&quot; is a poem in the form of a villanelle by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (1914–1953), and is one of his best-known works. Though first published in the journal &quot;Botteghe Oscure&quot; in 1951, Thomas wrote the poem in 1947 while visiting Florence with his family. The poem was subsequently included, alongside other works by Thomas, in &quot;In Country Sleep, and Other Poems&quot; (New Directions, 1952) and &quot;Collected Poems, 1934–1952&quot; (Dent, 1952). The poem entered the public domain on 1 January 2024.

It has been suggested that the poem was written for Thomas&#x27;s dying father, although he did not die until just before Christmas in 1952. It has no title other than its first line, &quot;Do not go gentle into that good night&quot;, a line that appears as a refrain throughout the poem along with its other refrain, &quot;Rage, rage against the dying of the light&quot;.

== Poem ==
&lt;poem&gt;Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.&lt;/poem&gt;

== Form ==

The villanelle consists of five stanzas of three lines (tercets) followed by a single stanza of four lines (a quatrain) for a total of nineteen lines. It is structured by two repeating rhymes and two refrains: the first line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the second and fourth stanzas, and the third line of the first stanza serves as the last line of the third and fifth stanzas. 

== Analysis ==
=== Summary ===
In the first stanza, the speaker encourages his father not to &quot;go gentle into that good night&quot; but rather to &quot;rage, rage against the dying of the light.&quot; Then, in the subsequent stanzas, he proceeds to list all manner of men, using terms such as &quot;wise&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;wild&quot;, and &quot;grave&quot; as descriptors, who, in their own respective ways, embody the refrains of the poem. In the final stanza, the speaker implores his father, whom he observes upon a &quot;sad height&quot;, begging him to &quot;Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears&quot;, and reiterates the refrains once more.

=== Literary opinion ===
While this poem has inspired a significant amount of unique discussion and analysis from such critics as Seamus Heaney, Jonathan Westphal, and Walford Davies, some interpretations of the poem&#x27;s meaning are under general consensus. &quot;This is obviously a threshold poem about death&quot;, Heaney writes, and Westphal agrees, noting that &quot;[Thomas] is advocating active resistance to death.&quot; Heaney thinks that the poem&#x27;s structure as a villanelle &quot;[turns] upon itself, advancing and retiring to and from a resolution&quot; in order to convey &quot;a vivid figure of the union of opposites&quot; that encapsulates &quot;the balance between natural grief and the recognition of necessity which pervades the poem as a whole.&quot;  

Westphal writes that the &quot;sad height&quot; Thomas refers to in line 16 is &quot;of particular importance and interest in appreciating the poem as a whole.&quot; He asserts that it was not a literal structure, such as a bier, not only because of the literal fact that Thomas&#x27; father died after the poem&#x27;s publication, but also because &quot;it would be pointless for Thomas to advise his father not to &#x27;go gentle&#x27; if he were already dead ...&quot; Instead, he thinks that Thomas&#x27; phrase refers to &quot;a metaphorical plateau of aloneness and loneliness before death&quot;. In his 2014 &quot;Writers of Wales&quot; biography of Thomas, Davies disagrees, instead believing that the imagery is more allusive in nature, and that it &quot;clearly evokes both King Lear on the heath and Gloucester thinking he is at Dover Cliff.&quot;

==Use and references in other works==

Other composers who have set the poem to music include Vincent Persichetti (1976) Elliot del Borgo (1979), John Cale (1989, on &quot;Words for the Dying&quot;) and Janet Owen Thomas (1999, in the final movement of her &quot;Under the Skin&quot;).

Additionally, lines from the poem are featured in the song &quot;Intro&quot; from G-Eazy&#x27;s album &quot;When It&#x27;s Dark Out&quot; (2015).

The poem is also read in full on Iggy Pop’s album &quot;Free&quot; (2019).

=== Art ===
&quot;Do not go gentle into that good night&quot; was the inspiration for three paintings by Swansea-born painter and printmaker Ceri Richards, who created them in 1954, 1956, and 1965 respectively.

=== Literature ===
The poem influenced the writing of Mircea Cărtărescu&#x27;s novel &quot;Solenoid&quot; (2015).

=== Film ===
The poem is prominently referenced in &quot;Interstellar&quot; (2014), where the poem is used repeatedly by Michael Caine&#x27;s character John Brand, as well as by several other supporting characters.

It also features in the 1986 comedy &quot;Back to School&quot; where Thornton Melon, played by Rodney Dangerfield, is required to recite the poem during an examination.

<text>Operation Agatha (Saturday, June 29, 1946), sometimes called Black Sabbath () or Black Saturday because it began on the Jewish sabbath, was a police and military operation conducted by the British authorities in Mandatory Palestine during the Jewish insurgency. Soldiers and police searched for arms and made arrests in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifa and several dozen settlements; the Jewish Agency was raided. The total number of British security forces involved is variously reported as 10,000, 17,000, and 25,000. About 2,700 individuals were arrested, among them future Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett. The officially given purpose of the operation was to end &quot;the state of anarchy&quot; then existing in Palestine. Other objectives included obtaining documentary proof of Jewish Agency approval of sabotage operations by the Palmach and of an alliance between the Haganah and the more violent Lehi (Stern Gang) and Irgun, destroying the Haganah&#x27;s military power, boosting army morale and preventing a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; being mounted by the Lehi and Irgun.

==Background==
On June 16, 1946, the &quot;Night of the Bridges&quot; had the Palmach blow up eight road and rail bridges linking Palestine to neighbouring countries. On June 17, the Lehi attacked railway workshops in Haifa. Shortly afterwards, the Irgun kidnapped six British officers. One officer subsequently escaped, and two were released. The Irgun announced that the remaining officers would be released only in exchange for the commutation of death sentences for two Irgun members.

The British Army had for months wanted to take military action against the Zionist underground organizations, but it had been blocked by High Commissioner Alan Cunningham, who was also particularly opposed to military action being taken against the Jewish Agency. Cunningham changed his mind after the &quot;Night of the Bridges&quot; and flew to London to meet the British Cabinet and army chief Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in London. Montgomery formulated the plan for Operation Agatha. With reluctance, Cunningham accepted it in the hope that with the more militant Zionists restrained, the way would be open to reaching a political settlement with the more moderate and pro-British leaders such as Chaim Weizmann. During the operation, a radio broadcast had Cunningham say, &quot;[The arrests] are not directed against the Jewish community as a whole but solely against those few who are taking an active part in the present campaign of violence and those who are responsible for instigating and directing it...&quot;

The Chief of the Secretariat, Sir John Shaw, outlined the official objective of the operation at a press conference in Jerusalem: &quot;Large-scale operations have been authorized to end the state of anarchy existing in Palestine and to enable law-abiding citizens to pursue their normal occupations without fear of kidnapping, murder, or being blown up&quot;. Shaw believed that the British should end the existing situation by partitioning Palestine into Jewish and Arab states and then leaving or by dismantling the Jewish Agency, which claimed administrative authority but secretly supported acts by the underground Zionist military organizations and governed without the authority. Thus, Shaw approved of the operation.

Several other objectives underlay the official one such as to obtain documentary proof of the Jewish Agency&#x27;s approval of sabotage operations by the Palmach and an alliance between the Haganah and the more violent Lehi (Stern Gang) and Irgun in carrying out violent acts. Another was to forestall a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot;. In June, members of the Jewish Agency&#x27;s Executive and the Haganah High Command had met with delegates of the Irgun and Lehi at which the latter, according to intelligence, had stated its intention of asking the Yishuv to participate in a &quot;coup&quot; &quot;for the proclamation of a future Jewish State and the interruption of all relations with the existing Palestine Administration&quot;. In the wake of the &quot;Night of the Bridges&quot;, another objective was to break the military power of the Haganah. Since the Haganah had appeared to be acting in co-operation with the Lehi and Irgun, the British authorities believed mistakenly that breaking its military power was also necessary because the Haganah might co-operate with the prospective Irgun and Lehi &quot;coup&quot;. Lastly, Montgomery had stated that the operation was required to boost army morale.

==Operation==
On June 29, Operation Agatha began; it lasted until July 1. Curfews were imposed throughout Palestine, low-flying planes circled Jerusalem, roadblocks were put up, trains were flagged down and passengers were evacuated and escorted home. Special licenses were required for the operations of emergency vehicles. British troops and police raided the Jewish Agency headquarters in Jerusalem, the Jewish Agency office in Tel Aviv and other Jewish institutions such as the Women&#x27;s International Zionist Organization and the Histadrut. A total of 27 Jewish settlements in Palestine were searched, and the residents of these settlements sometimes put up fierce resistance. Four Jews were killed resisting British searches. Mass arrests of Jewish leaders and Haganah members were carried out. A total of 2,718 people were arrested, including four members of the Jewish Agency Executive, seven Haganah officers, and nearly half of the Palmach&#x27;s fighting force. However, a Haganah intelligence warning allowed most Haganah commanders to evade arrest, including David Ben-Gurion, as he was in Paris at the time.

Searches of Jewish settlements uncovered 15 arms caches, including one of the Haganah&#x27;s three central arsenals at Kibbutz Yagur, where 325 rifles, 425,000 bullets, 96 2-inch mortars, 5,200 mortar shells, 5,000 grenades and 78 revolvers were confiscated. The arms were displayed at a press conference, and all of the men of Yagur were arrested.

The searches were resisted by large swathes of the Jewish population, many of whom were Holocaust survivors. Roadblocks were constructed and British troops were attacked while conducting searches. Some Jews conducted lie-ins to prevent the movement of military trucks, and others publicly displayed their concentration camp tattoos to the British in order to try to elicit their sympathy. A few British soldiers exacerbated the tense atmosphere by shouting &quot;Heil Hitler&quot; and scrawling swastikas on walls while they conducted searches.

==Aftermath==
After Agatha ended, the kidnapped British officers were released, and High Commissioner Alan Cunningham commuted the Irgun members&#x27; death sentences to life imprisonment.

The Haganah and Palmach were dissuaded from continued anti-British operations. However, the more extreme groups, the Lehi (Stern Gang) and the Irgun Tzvai Leumi, headed by future Prime Minister Menachem Begin, continued and even intensified their attacks.

Specifically, the Irgun retaliated for Operation Agatha by bombing the south wing of the King David Hotel, which was the headquarters of the British government in Palestine. One reason for bombing the south wing was that it was presumed to be the place to which the British had taken the documents from the Jewish Agency.

<doc id="551573" wikidata="Q735247" url="?curid=551573" title="Jim Thompson (Illinois politician)">
<text>James Robert Thompson Jr. (May 8, 1936 – August 14, 2020) was an American politician, lobbyist, and federal prosecutor who served as the 37th governor of Illinois from 1977 to 1991. He was Illinois&#x27;s longest-serving governor, having been elected to four consecutive terms and holding the office for 14 years, and is also the only governor to have served more than two terms.

Thompson was known as a &quot;Rockefeller Republican&quot;, governing during his tenure as both a fiscal conservative and social liberal. In later years, Thompson served as a member of the 9/11 Commission, charged with investigating the September 11 attacks.

==Early life and education==
Thompson was born in Chicago, the son of Agnes Josephine (Swanson) and James Robert Thompson, a physician. His maternal grandparents were Swedish, and his father was descended from colonial Massachusetts governor David Thompson through an entirely paternal line. Through his father&#x27;s father he is also descended from Josiah Winslow, John Winthrop the Younger, John Leverett, John Underhill and John Mason. His father&#x27;s mother had ancestors who were Presbyterians of Scottish descent from Carrickfergus, Ballymena and Coleraine, County Antrim, Ireland in what has since become Northern Ireland. Thompson graduated from North Park Academy (now North Park University) and studied at the University of Illinois at Chicago Navy Pier campus before transferring to Washington University in St. Louis, where he earned his undergraduate degree. He received his J.D. from Northwestern University in 1959.

==Law career==
Thompson worked in the Cook County State&#x27;s Attorney&#x27;s office, taught at Northwestern University&#x27;s law school, and was appointed by President Richard Nixon to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. He served from November 1971 until June 1975.

As a federal prosecutor in the early 1970s, he obtained a conviction against former governor Otto Kerner Jr. for his use of improper influence on behalf of the racetrack industry.

He also tried and convicted many of Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley&#x27;s top aides, most notably Alderman Thomas E. Keane and County Clerk Matt Danaher, on various corruption charges. People like Keane and Danaher, the mayor&#x27;s point man on patronage were also major figures in the Cook County Democratic Party&#x27;s political machine. These high-profile cases gave Thompson the celebrity that fueled his run for governor in 1976.

To the chagrin of many, Thompson was bipartisan in his attacks on corruption in Cook County and Chicago. He not only prosecuted high-profile Democrats, but also prominent Republicans such as County Commissioner Floyd Fulle and former U.S. Senate candidate, William Rentschler. Organized crime in Chicago was harder for his unit to crack and there were few high-profile cases during his era.

==Governor of Illinois==
=== 1976 election ===

In the 1976 election, he won 65 percent of the vote over Democratic Secretary of State Michael Howlett, who had defeated incumbent governor Dan Walker in the primary and who had the support of Chicago Mayor and Cook County Democratic Party chairman Richard J. Daley. Thompson was the first candidate for governor to receive over 3 million votes; his tally of 3,000,395 remains the largest number of votes ever cast for a candidate in an election for Governor of Illinois. His first term was for only two years because Illinois moved its gubernatorial election from presidential-election years to midterm-election years.

=== 1978 and 1982 elections ===

Thompson was re-elected to a full four-year term in 1978 with 60 percent of the vote, defeating State Comptroller Michael Bakalis. In 1982, Thompson was very narrowly re-elected over former U.S. Senator Adlai E. Stevenson III. Thompson won the contest by only 5,074 votes.

=== 1986 election ===

A rematch in 1986 was expected to be almost as close, but the Democrats were severely hamstrung when supporters of Lyndon LaRouche won the Democratic nominations for lieutenant governor and secretary of state. Stevenson refused to appear on the same ticket as the LaRouchites, and formed the Solidarity Party with the support of the regular state Democratic organization. 
With the Democrats badly split, Thompson skated to victory in the general election. Thompson was accused of hiding the sad shape that Illinois&#x27; economy and budget were in while campaigning, but once elected, called for an emergency session of the Illinois legislature to address the crisis.

=== Tenure ===

In November 1980, Thompson, by his executive order, instituted a hiring freeze for all state agencies, boards, bureaus, and commissions under his control as governor. The order affected approximately 60,000 state positions.

These positions could only be filled if the candidates were first approved by an office created by Thompson, the Governor&#x27;s Office of Personnel. Suit was brought and the Supreme Court held this political patronage practice unconstitutional as a violation of the First Amendment rights of low-level public employees in &quot;Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois&quot;, 497 U.S. 62 (1990).

In 1989, Governor Thompson agreed to establish a compounding, 3 percent cost-of-living increase for retirees from Illinois government jobs, including public school teachers. Years later, in an interview with a Chicago business magazine, Thompson said he never knew the cost might exceed $1 billion and likely would not have signed it if he had known.
In recent years, the cumulative effect of the 3 percent annual increases has been recognized as one of the major causes of Illinois&#x27; public employee pension crisis.

In 1993, the State of Illinois Center in Chicago was renamed the James R. Thompson Center to honor the former governor.

===Presidential speculations===
During his tenure, Thompson was mentioned as a potential future candidate for president or vice president. In 1978, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared that &quot;during his first year of elective office, Gov. James R. Thompson has passed one test of a viable presidential candidate to oppose Jimmy Carter&quot; in 1980. Thompson did not run for president, but was reportedly considered as a running mate for Republican nominee Ronald Reagan. For several years, Thompson considered the possibility of making a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988. A &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; report in 1988 concluded that Thompson had been very interested in serving as president, but felt that it was too soon for him to run in 1980 and unviable to run against incumbent vice president George H. W. Bush in 1988. He was approached for interest on the Bush ticket in 1988 but asked to be not considered, stating he had concern about &quot;the effect of the campaign on his family.&quot;

===Legal and lobbying career===
After leaving public service, Thompson joined Winston &amp; Strawn, a Chicago-based law firm. Thompson served as chairman of the executive committee from 1991 to 2006, and as chairman and CEO of the firm from 1993 to 2006. He was senior chairman until January 31, 2015.

As CEO of Winston &amp; Strawn, he focused in the area of government relations and regulatory affairs. The firm has lobbied for American Airlines, and he previously represented United Airlines.

Winston &amp; Strawn is the same firm that represented former Illinois governor George Ryan pro bono against federal charges relating to the &quot;Licenses-for-Bribes&quot; scandal during Ryan&#x27;s tenure as Illinois Governor and Secretary of State. Thompson acted as Ryan&#x27;s lawyer personally.

On April 17, 2006, Ryan was convicted on all 18 counts, which included racketeering, misusing state resources for political gain, and fraud. He was sentenced to 6½ years in federal prison and began serving his sentence on November 7, 2007. Ryan was released from federal prison on July 3, 2013.

Thompson was also a director and head of the Audit Committee for Hollinger International, the media company founded by Conrad Black, which was the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.

==Later career==

In 2002, he was appointed to serve on the 9/11 Commission, where he aggressively questioned Richard Clarke, the former chief counter-terrorism adviser on the United States National Security Council. The commission&#x27;s findings were released in the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; on July 22, 2004.

During the 2008 presidential primary campaign, Thompson announced his support for former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for the 2008 Republican nomination. He stressed that Giuliani was the only Republican in the field who could win Illinois.

===Death===
After suffering from heart issues, Thompson died on August 14, 2020, at the age of 84.

In a tribute on Twitter, political consultant David Axelrod, who covered Thompson as a young journalist, described him as &quot;one of the smartest and most formidable politicians I’ve ever known.&quot;

==Awards==
James R. Thompson was inducted as a laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the state&#x27;s highest honor) by the governor of Illinois in 1991 in the area of Government.

== Legacy ==
A bust of Thompson was erected in 2022 in front of Gate 4 at Rate Field, home of the Chicago White Sox. The base of the bust states, &quot;Longest serving governor in Illinois history; 1977–1991; He kept the White Sox in Chicago.&quot; It is a reference to Thompson&#x27;s efforts in 1988 to convince Illinois lawmakers to approve funding of a new stadium for the White Sox, who were threatening to move the club to St. Petersburg, Florida&#x27;s newly built Suncoast Dome. Legislators ultimately approved a last-minute deal to build a new stadium on June 30, 1988, and new Comiskey Park opened in 1991.

<text>Born Free is a 1966 British drama film starring the real-life couple Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers as Joy and George Adamson, another real-life couple, who raised Elsa the Lioness, an orphaned lion cub, to adulthood and released her into the wilderness of Kenya. The film was produced by Open Road Films Ltd. and Columbia Pictures. The screenplay, written by blacklisted Hollywood writer Lester Cole (under the pseudonym &quot;Gerald L.C. Copley&quot;), was based upon Joy Adamson&#x27;s 1960 non-fiction book &quot;Born Free&quot;. The film was directed by James Hill and produced by Sam Jaffe and Paul Radin. &quot;Born Free&quot;, and its musical score, by John Barry, as well as the title song, with lyrics by Don Black and sung by Matt Monro, won numerous awards.

==Plot==
In the Northern province of Kenya, British Game Warden George Adamson is forced to kill a man-eating lion and his lioness. He realises too late that the lioness was charging in defence of her three cubs and so, realising the cubs are now motherless, brings them home so he and his wife Joy can raise them. They name the cubs Big One, Lustika and Elsa. When the cubs become too old, Big One and Lustika are sent off to Rotterdam Zoo whilst George and Joy keep Elsa, having become especially attached to her.

Years later, George’s boss, John Kendall informs him that a lion in Kiunga has been killing goats in a local village. George is sent to kill the lion, which he does successfully, allowing him and Joy to enjoy a holiday with Elsa near the Indian ocean. When they return to the Northern Province, the Adamsons learn that Elsa has caused a massive elephant stampede. John says that they can no longer keep Elsa and must find a zoo. However, Joy instead wishes to set Elsa free, believing a zoo would make her miserable. John reluctantly agrees to give the Adamson three months to do so.

The Adamsons bring Elsa to the Meru National Park to begin her rehabilitation. They start off by trying to introduce her to a wild lion along with a kill. This does not go to plan as they return the next day only to find Elsa all alone. Elsa continually fails to make a kill, being attacked by a warthog during one attempt. Eventually, the Adamsons decide to leave Elsa for a week in the bush to encourage her to become more independent. However, they find her severely injured, possibly by wild lions. George now believes Elsa cannot survive so must be sent to a zoo, which Joy opposes, wanting Elsa to have her freedom. This proves to be a good decision because Elsa eventually leaves for days at a time, making several kills by herself. When she comes into season, she is taken out for her final test: joining a wild pride. Despite initially being attacked, Elsa is accepted into a pride much to Joy and George’s relief.

A year later, the Adamsons return to Kenya in search of Elsa. They are delighted to discover that she has thrived as a wild lion and is now a mother to three cubs. However, Joy and George decide to let the cubs remain wild instead of hand-rearing them as they did with Elsa and her sisters.

==Cast==
* Virginia McKenna as Joy Adamson
* Bill Travers as George Adamson
* Geoffrey Keen as John Kendall
* Peter Lukoye as Nuru
* Surya Patel as the Doctor
* Geoffrey Best as Watson, a big game hunter
* Bill Godden as Sam

The film&#x27;s credits list lions and lionesses Boy, Girl, Henrietta, Mara, Ugas, and &quot;the Cubs&quot;.

==Production==
The film reunited the real-life couple Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna as a couple first seen together in &quot;The Smallest Show on Earth&quot; in 1957.

George Adamson served as chief technical advisor on the film and discusses his involvement in his first autobiography, &quot;Bwana Game&quot; (UK title, 1968), known in the US as &quot;A Lifetime with Lions&quot;. According to Ben Mankiewicz, who introduces the film on Turner Classic Movies, the production unit mainly used wild lions.

The making of the film was a life-changing experience for actors Virginia McKenna and her husband Bill Travers, who became animal rights activists and were instrumental in creating the Born Free Foundation.

One of the lions in the film was played by a former mascot of the Scots Guards, who had to leave him behind when they left Kenya.
The producers also acknowledged the help received from Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and the Game Department of Uganda.

==Critical response and box-office==
&quot;Born Free&quot; received critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of 17 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.1 out of 10.

Vincent Canby waxed enthusiastic about the film, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Almost from the opening shot – a vast expanse of corn-coloured African plain where lions feed on the carcass of a freshly killed zebra – one knows that Joy Adamson&#x27;s best-selling book &quot;Born Free&quot; has been entrusted to honest, intelligent filmmakers. Without minimising the facts of animal life or overly sentimentalising them, this film casts an enchantment that is just about irresistible.&quot;

The film was one of the most popular movies at the box office in Britain during 1966.

==Accolades==
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Born Free&quot; – Nominated
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated

==Sequels and spinoffs==
The book &quot;Born Free&quot; (1960) was followed by two other books, &quot;Living Free&quot; (1961) and &quot;Forever Free&quot; (1963). A film sequel titled &quot;Living Free&quot; was directed by Jack Couffer and released in 1972. While deriving its name from the second book, the film was based on the third book in the series. It starred Susan Hampshire and Nigel Davenport as Joy and George Adamson although the film was not as well-received as its predecessor.

A documentary follow-up to &quot;Born Free&quot;, titled &quot;The Lions Are Free&quot;, was directed by James Hill and Bill Travers and released in 1969. The film follows &quot;Born Free&quot; actor Bill Travers as he journeys to a remote area in Kenya to visit George Adamson, and several of Adamson&#x27;s lion friends.

In 1974, a 13-episode American television series was broadcast by NBC, titled &quot;Born Free&quot;, starring Diana Muldaur and Gary Collins as Joy and George Adamson. The series was later followed by the 1996 television film &quot;Born Free: A New Adventure&quot; directed by Tommy Lee Wallace and starring Linda Purl and Chris Noth. Joy and George Adamson do not appear as the main characters in the story. It spawned a TV series in 1998, but none of the episodes aired in the U.S.

&quot;To Walk with Lions&quot; (1999), directed by Carl Schultz, depicts the last years of George Adamson&#x27;s life as seen through the eyes of his assistant, Tony Fitzjohn. George is portrayed by Richard Harris, and Honor Blackman makes a brief appearance as Joy.

On 28 September 2010 BBC Four ran a number of programs to mark the 50th anniversary of the publishing of the book, Born Free. These included a new one hour documentary entitled &#x27;The Born Free Legacy&#x27;. It explores the story behind the book &#x27;Born Free&#x27; about the lives of Joy and George Adamson with the orphaned lion cub Elsa. It then looks at the huge impact the book, and the subsequent 1966 movie had on the growing wildlife conservation movement. It includes archive footage and clips of interviews with the Adamson&#x27;s as well as various contributions from people including Virginia McKenna, Tony Fitzjohn (George Adamson&#x27;s long time assistant) and Sir David Attenborough.

On 1 February 2011 the long running BBC series Natural World broadcast episode 10 of series 29 which was entitled &#x27;Elsa: The Lioness that Changed the World&#x27;. This episode, narrated by actor Richard Armitage, looked back at Elsa&#x27;s life and legacy, and the work done by George Adamson to rehabilitate lions into the wild following the making of the Born Free film. A slightly shortened version of this episode, this time narrated by the conservationist Chris Morgan, under the title &quot;Elsa&#x27;s Legacy: The Born Free Story&quot; was also shown as part of the &quot;Nature&quot; TV series , released on PBS stations in January 2011.

<text>James Thomas Tague (October 17, 1936 – February 28, 2014) was a car salesman who received minor injuries during the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. Tague received a minor wound to his right cheek caused by tiny pieces of concrete debris from a street curb that was struck by fragments from a bullet that was fired at Kennedy. Besides Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally, Tague was the only other person known to have been struck as a result of gunfire at Dallas&#x27;s Dealey Plaza that day.

==Life==
Tague was born on a farm near Plainfield, Indiana. He dropped out of Purdue University to join the United States Air Force. He graduated from the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine and became a car salesman in Dallas, Texas.

==Kennedy assassination==
Tague had been driving to Downtown Dallas to have lunch with his girlfriend, and future wife, when he came upon a traffic jam caused by the presidential motorcade that was traveling west on Elm Street. Tague testified to the Warren Commission that because of the traffic, he parked his car on the north curb of Commerce Street, where he then &quot;got out of his car and stood by the bridge abutment.&quot; Tague was a few feet north of the southern edge of the triple underpass railroad bridge when he saw the presidential limousine and heard the first shot.

As with many other witnesses, Tague remembered hearing this first shot and likened it to a firecracker. He later testified that the first shot he recalled hearing had occurred after the presidential limousine had already completed the 120-degree slow turn from Houston Street onto Elm Street and then straightened out. The motorcade then proceeded in his direction down Elm Street, parallel to Commerce Street.

Soon after the shots were fired, Tague was approached by Dallas Detective Buddy Walthers, who noticed specks of blood on Tague&#x27;s right cheek. The detective asked Tague where he had been standing. The two men then examined the area and discovered, on the upper, curved part of Main Street south curb, a &quot;very fresh scar&quot; impact that they believed indicated that a bullet had struck there and had taken a small chip out of the curb&#x27;s concrete. They came to the conclusion that one bullet had ricocheted off the curb and the debris then hit Tague.

The curb surrounding the scar chip was not cut out until August 1964, after Tague had repeatedly reminded authorities of also being wounded during the shots, and it is now in the National Archives. The scar chip was north of the south edge of the triple underpass railroad bridge, about from where Tague stood during the attack. The detective told Tague that it appeared that a bullet had been fired from either the Texas School Book Depository or the Dal-Tex Building.

==After assassination==
===Warren Commission and FBI===
Tague was called by the Warren Commission to testify on July 23, 1964. He initially stated that he had been wounded on his cheek by the second or the third of the three shots that he remembered hearing. When the commission&#x27;s counsel pressed him to be more specific, Tague testified that he had been wounded by the second shot. When asked from where he felt the gunshots had come, Tague testified that they were &quot;from back over my right shoulder, which was in the direction of the School Book Depository.&quot;

According to the Warren Commission&#x27;s final report, forensic tests by the FBI revealed that the chipped bullet mark impact location contained no embedded copper metal residue, which indicated that it was not created by &quot;an unmutilated military full metal-jacketed bullet such as the bullet from Governor Connally&#x27;s stretcher.&quot; In Tague&#x27;s &quot;Truth Withheld&quot;, he published pictures of the wound that were taken on November 23, 1963.

===Books and events===
In 2003, forty years after the assassination, Tague published a book called &quot;Truth Withheld&quot; (), detailing his experiences during and after the assassination. He wrote that he was injured after the second shot.

In 2011, Tague revisited the scene of his injury for the researcher Max Holland&#x27;s investigation into the first shot for the documentary &quot;JFK: The Lost Bullet&quot;.

In 2013, Tague published his second book, &quot;LBJ and the Kennedy Killing&quot; (), which claimed that Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates were involved in the assassination.

==Later life and death==
Tague became a car salesman in Bonham, Texas, where he retired. He died there on February 28, 2014, at the age of 77.

He wrote: &quot;Reputed to be dead of AIDS, Lisa DeLeeuw and Brandy Alexandre, now out of the industry, proclaimed themselves alive and healthy.&quot; However, in 2003, another publication, &quot;Headpress 25&quot;, claimed that De Leeuw died of complications from HIV/AIDS on November 11, 1993.

<text>Daniel Hans Sedin (born 26 September 1980) is a Swedish ice hockey executive and former winger who played his entire 17-season National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Vancouver Canucks from 2000 to 2018. Born and raised in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, Sedin and his identical twin brother Henrik played together throughout their careers; the pair were renowned for their effectiveness as a tandem. During his career, Daniel was known as a goal-scorer (150+ more career NHL goals than Henrik), while Henrik was known as a playmaker (150+ more career NHL assists than Daniel). Sedin tallied 393 goals and 648 assists in 1,306 games played in the NHL, ranking him as the Canucks&#x27; second-highest points scorer all time, behind only his brother Henrik.

Sedin began his professional career in the Swedish Hockey League with Modo Hockey in 1997 and was co-recipient, with Henrik, of the 1999 Guldpucken as Swedish player of the year. He played four seasons with Modo (including a return in 2004–05 due to the NHL lockout), helping the club to two consecutive appearances in the Le Mat Trophy Finals, in 1999 and 2000, where they lost both times. Selected second overall by the Canucks in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft, Sedin moved to the NHL in the 2000–01 season. He spent his entire NHL career in Vancouver, and in 2016 became the club&#x27;s all-time top goal scorer. After emerging as a top player in the club during the 2005–06 season, Sedin since recorded six consecutive campaigns of at least 20 goals and 70 points. In 2011, he won the Art Ross Trophy as the League&#x27;s leading point-scorer and the Ted Lindsay Award as the best player in the League, as voted by fellow players. Sedin was also nominated for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the League&#x27;s most valuable player. In Sweden, he and Henrik were awarded the Victoria Scholarship as the country&#x27;s athletes of the year. Alongside his brother, Daniel was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2022.

Internationally, Sedin has competed on the Swedish national ice hockey team. In addition to being a three-time Winter Olympian, he has appeared in two European Junior Championships, two World Junior Championships and four World Championships. He won gold medals at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin and 2013 IIHF World Championship in Stockholm. Sedin earned a silver medal at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi and two World Championship bronze medals, at the 1999 and 2001 editions.

== Early life ==
Daniel Sedin was born on 26 September 1980, in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, six minutes after his identical twin brother, Henrik. The pair have two older brothers, Stefan and Peter. Their father, Tommy, is a school vice-principal and also played for Modo Hockey in the 1960s, while his mother, Tora, is a nurse. Daniel began playing organized hockey with Henrik when they were eight. They did not regularly play on the same line until Daniel switched from centre to wing at 14. Daniel and Henrik both attended high school at the Nolaskolan Gymnasium in Sweden while playing professionally for Modo.

== Playing career ==

=== Modo Hockey (1997–2000) ===
Aged 16, Daniel and Henrik began their professional careers in 1997–98 with Modo Hockey of the Swedish Hockey League. Daniel recorded 12 points over 45 games during his rookie season. In his second professional year, he led Modo in scoring with 42 points in 50 games, helping the club to its second regular season title in team history. Daniel then added 12 points in 13 playoff games as Modo advanced to the Le Mat Trophy Finals, where they lost to Brynäs IF. At the end of the campaign, Daniel and Henrik were named co-recipients of the Guldpucken, the Swedish player of the year award.

The Sedins were considered top prospects for the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. Rated as the top draft-eligible players from Europe, they were expected to be top five selections and expressed a desire to play for the same team. As they were unlikely to be picked by the same team, their agent, Mike Barnett, president of international talent agency IMG, presented them with two options to circumvent the usual NHL draft process, allowing them to play together. The first option was for the pair to enter the 1999 Draft and not sign with their respective NHL clubs for two years, allowing them to become unrestricted free agents. This option required that they play junior hockey in North America, which was not their intention. Barnett also suggested either Henrik or Daniel opt out of the 1999 Draft, hoping that the team that selected the first twin would select the other the following year. On the possibility of the Sedins&#x27; playing for separate teams, Vancouver Canucks Scout Thomas Gradin commented, &quot;They&#x27;re good enough to play with anyone, but separately their capacity might decrease by 10 or 15 percent.&quot; Nevertheless, Henrik and Daniel both entered the 1999 Draft expecting to be selected by separate teams. However, then-Canucks general manager Brian Burke already possessed the third overall pick and through a series of transactions he obtained the second overall pick. He used these second and third overall picks to select Daniel and Henrik, respectively. Gradin notified them of the Canucks&#x27; intentions five minutes before the Draft. Although Tampa Bay Lightning general manager Rick Dudley was ready to make Daniel his first overall choice before opening negotiations, he was convinced by Burke and Barnett that Daniel would not sign unless his brother was on the same team.

On 27 July 1999, a month following the Draft, Daniel and Henrik signed identical three-year, US$1 million contracts with the Canucks. As the contract did not require them to begin playing in Vancouver immediately, they announced on 12 August they would return to Sweden to play one more season with Modo. During the 1999–2000 season, Daniel finished second in team scoring with 45 points in 50 games, two points behind Henrik. The two brothers played on a line during the season with New York Islanders prospect Mattias Weinhandl. In the 2000 playoffs, Daniel added a team-leading eight goals and 14 points. He recorded two goals and two assists in the deciding game of the semifinals against Brynäs IF, a 6–3 win for Modo. Modo made their second straight finals appearance, where they lost the playoff championship to Djurgårdens IF in three-straight games.

=== Vancouver Canucks (2000–2018) ===

==== Early career and adjusting (2000–2006) ====
The 2000–01 season was Daniel&#x27;s and (Henrik&#x27;s) first season with the Canucks and in the NHL. His NHL debut was the team&#x27;s first game of the 2000–01 campaign on 5 October 2000, a 6–3 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Daniel and Henrik became the fourth pair of twins to have played in the NHL. Three days later, Daniel scored his first career NHL goal against goaltender Dan Cloutier of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Assisted by Henrik, the goal tied the game at 4–4 with 1:13 minutes left to go in a 5–4 regulation win. On 30 November, he suffered a shoulder injury, sidelining him for four games. During his recovery, he was reprimanded by Canucks head coach Marc Crawford, who told him that playing through pain is part of being in the NHL. Later in the season, he missed an additional three games due to a back injury, shortening his rookie season to 75 games. He became the first rookie in 2000–01 to reach 20 goals when he scored on 21 March 2001, in a 1–1 tie against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Finishing the campaign with that goal total, he tied for second among League rookies in scoring with Shane Willis of the Carolina Hurricanes, behind Brad Richards of the Tampa Bay Lightning. He also had 14 assists for 34 points in total. Making his Stanley Cup playoff debut on 12 April against the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning and eventual Stanley Cup champion Colorado Avalanche, Daniel his first playoff assist and point with an assist on an Ed Jovanovski goal in the opening game of the first-round series, a 5–4 loss for the Canucks. He added his first NHL playoff goal in game three of the series on 16 April as the Canucks were eventually eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Avalanche in a four-game sweep. He and Henrik played primarily on the Canucks&#x27; third line. Daniel received one third-place vote from the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association for the Calder Memorial Trophy as NHL rookie of the year, finishing eighth in award balloting overall.

Shortly into the 2001 off-season in May 2001, Daniel underwent surgery for a herniated disc in his lower back, from which he suffered during the 2001 World Championships in Germany. In his second NHL season, Daniel struggled with the lowest goals total of his career, with nine. The campaign included a 25-game stretch without a goal between mid-October and the end of November 2001. With 23 assists, he had 32 points overall. Vancouver finished with the eighth and final seed in the Western Conference for the second consecutive year. Facing the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning and eventual Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the 2002 playoffs, they were eliminated in six games.

In 2002–03, Daniel continued his point-scoring pace of the previous two campaigns with 14 goals and 17 assists for 31 points in 79 games. Vancouver finished the season fourth overall in the West and advanced to the second round for the first time in Daniel&#x27;s career defeating the fifth-seeded St. Louis Blues in the first round in seven games. During the 2003 playoffs, he appeared in a career-high 14 playoff games and recorded six points, as the Canucks were upset in seven games by the sixth-seeded Minnesota Wild. Daniel and Henrik were re-signed in the off-season to one-year, US$1.125 million contracts on 29 July 2003.

The Sedins began the 2003–04 season on a line with first-year player Jason King. The trio were dubbed the &quot;Mattress Line&quot; (two twins and a King) and formed the Canucks&#x27; second scoring line until King was reassigned to the team&#x27;s minor league affiliate midway through the season. Daniel was awarded his first penalty shot on 17 January 2004, in a game against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He was stopped by goaltender Jean-Sébastien Giguère as Anaheim went on to win the game 2–1. On 24 February, Daniel recorded his first NHL career hat-trick with a four-goal effort in a 4–2 win over the Detroit Red Wings. Over all 82 games played, Daniel increased his production to 18 goals, 36 assists and 54 points. The Canucks won the Northwest Division title in the regular season and were the third seed in the West Overall , before losing to the sixth-seeded Calgary Flames in the first round of the playoffs. Daniel recorded a goal and two assists in the seven-game series.

Daniel and Henrik were re-signed to one-year, US$1.25 million contracts on 10 September 2004. However, due to the 2004–05 lockout, Daniel returned to Sweden to play for Modo, along with Henrik and their Canucks teammate Markus Näslund. He finished the season with 33 points in 49 games, fourth in team scoring behind Peter Forsberg, Mattias Weinhandl and Henrik.

When NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Daniel returned to the Canucks and scored 22 goals, 49 assists and 71 points in all 82 contests played. He tied for third in team point-scoring with Todd Bertuzzi, behind Henrik and Näslund. His scoring success that season was influenced, in part, by the signing of winger Anson Carter, who played on the Sedins&#x27; line and led the team in goal-scoring. The trio matched the scoring pace of the Canucks&#x27; top line of Näslund, Bertuzzi and Brendan Morrison. Vancouver&#x27;s head coach at the time, Marc Crawford, recalled that season as marking the Sedins&#x27; ascent to leaders on the team, stating that &quot;by the end of that year, they definitely were our top guys. They had surpassed Näslund and Bertuzzi.&quot; Despite the brothers&#x27; individual achievements, the Canucks missed the playoffs for the first time in their careers as the Canucks missed the 2006 playoffs by just three points in the standings. Despite the Sedins&#x27; success with Carter in the season, the Canucks did not re-sign him after the season concluded.

==== Rise to stardom, Stanley Cup Finals, individual awards (2006–2015) ====
Daniel and Henrik re-signed with the Canucks to identical three-year, $10.75 million contracts on 30 June 2006. In the 2006–07 season, Daniel established himself as the Canucks&#x27; top scorer. He led the team with 36 goals and 48 assists for 84 points in 81 games to lead the Canucks in scoring as the Canucks returned to the playoffs having finished the season as the third seed in the Western Conference. He also tied a League record with four goals in overtime over the course of the season. On 13 January 2007, Daniel scored his 100th NHL goal in a 6–1 win over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Leafs&#x27; goaltender Andrew Raycroft. Daniel notched his second career NHL hat-trick on 6 February, scoring two goals against Edmonton Oilers goaltender Dwayne Roloson and one into an empty net. He later took the second penalty shot of his career on 8 March, against the Phoenix Coyotes. However, he was stopped once again by Curtis Joseph; Vancouver went on to win the game 4–2. Winger Taylor Pyatt, acquired in a trade from the Buffalo Sabres during the 2006 off-season, replaced Carter as the Sedins&#x27; linemate and went on to score a career-high 23 goals. On 11 April, in the opening game of the 2007 playoffs against the Dallas Stars, Daniel assisted on Henrik&#x27;s quadruple-overtime goal to end the longest-ever Canucks playoff game and the sixth longest in NHL history at 138 minutes and six seconds of play. Daniel struggled to produce offensively in the playoffs, however, managing five points over 12 games as the Canucks defeated the sixth-seeded Stars in seven games before eventually being eliminated by the second-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Anaheim Ducks in the second round in five games.

Daniel recorded 74 points (29 goals, 45 assists) in all 82 games in 2007–08, as the Canucks missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. He finished second in team point-scoring to Henrik and first in goals. The Sedins saw some time with Näslund on their top line during the season to form an all-Swedish forward unit.

In 2008–09, Daniel recorded 31 goals, 51 assists and 82 points in all 82 games, tying Henrik for the team lead in points. He opened the campaign being named the NHL&#x27;s First Star of the Week on 13 October 2008, with a five-point effort over two games. Steve Bernier had been acquired in the 2008 off-season in another trade with the Sabres, and began the season on the top line with the Sedins. Bernier was later removed; and on 12 February 2009, Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault moved Alexandre Burrows up from the third line during a game against the Phoenix Coyotes. Late in the campaign, Daniel was named the NHL&#x27;s Second Star of the Week on 30 March, after recording four goals and four assists in four games, including a game-winning goal. After the Canucks finished the season as a team as the third seed in the Western Conference, he added ten points over ten games in the 2009 playoffs, helping the third seeded Canucks sweep the sixth-seeded St. Louis Blues in the first round and advance to the second round, where they were defeated in six games by the fourth-seeded Chicago Blackhawks.

Set to become unrestricted free agents on 1 July 2009, Daniel and Henrik began negotiating with the Canucks in the 2009 off-season and were reported to have asked for 12-year, $63 million contracts in mid-June. With free agency looming, Canucks general manager Mike Gillis visited the Sedins in Sweden, where they agreed on identical five-year, $30.5 million contracts on 1 July. Four games into the 2009–10 season on 7 October, Daniel suffered the first major injury of his career, breaking his foot in a game against the Montreal Canadiens. He suffered the injury after being hit by a slapshot from teammate Alexander Edler. Although Daniel finished the game and recorded three assists on goals by Henrik, Alexandre Burrows and Steve Bernier, x-rays a few days later on 11 October revealed the fracture. He was sidelined for 18 games, returning to the ice on 22 November against the Chicago Blackhawks in which the Canucks lost 1–0 with Blackhawks&#x27; forward Bryan Bickell scoring the only goal of the game. Daniel notched his third career NHL hat-trick in a 4–2 win against the Atlanta Thrashers on 10 December. Four days later, he was named the NHL&#x27;s Second Star of the Week with seven points over the course of the week. In the final game of the season, on 10 April 2010, against the Calgary Flames, Daniel scored his fourth career NHL hat-trick in a 7–3 win. All three goals were assisted by his brother Henrik, helping Henrik pass Washington Capitals forward and captain Alexander Ovechkin for the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s leading point-scorer. The last goal was chosen by TSN in a fan-voted poll as the NHL&#x27;s play of the year; Daniel received a between-the-legs tip pass from Henrik near the corner boards before beating Flames goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff with a between-the-legs deke. Daniel finished the season with 29 goals, a career-high 56 assists and 85 points and playing in 63 games while the Canucks as a team finished as the third seed in the West for the second consecutive season. His 1.35 points per game rate was third in the League behind Henrik and Ovechkin. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Daniel recorded ten points in the opening round against the Los Angeles Kings, including the series-winning goal on Kings’ goaltender Jonathan Quick in the late stages of Game 6 as the Canucks defeated the sixth-seeded Kings 4–2 in the game for a 4–2 series victory. Against the Chicago Blackhawks the following round, his production decreased to four points as the Canucks were eliminated in six games by the second-seeded Blackhawks for the second straight season. In the off-season, Daniel was named to the NHL second All-Star team. It marked the first time since 1973–74 that two brothers were named postseason NHL All-Stars, as Henrik had been named to the First Team. They were also chosen to appear together on the cover of EA Sports&#x27; European version of the &quot;NHL 11&quot; video game.

On 9 October 2010, Daniel was named an alternate captain for the Canucks, who named Henrik captain during a pre-game ceremony to celebrate the team&#x27;s 40th anniversary. He was joined by Ryan Kesler, Kevin Bieksa and newly signed free agent Manny Malhotra as alternates. Daniel wore the &quot;A&quot; during Canucks home games, along with Kesler. On 10 January 2011, Daniel was named the NHL&#x27;s First Star of the Week after scoring five goals and seven points in four games. During that span, he scored the 10,000th goal in Canucks franchise history in a 3–1 win against the Calgary Flames on 5 January. Later in the month, Daniel competed in his first career NHL All-Star Game. Drafted onto Team Staal, he played with Canucks teammate Ryan Kesler opposite Henrik on Team Lidstrom. In the Skills Competition, Daniel won the shooting accuracy segment by first beating Martin Havlát to all four targets in 7.3 seconds, then defeating Patrick Kane in the final in 8.9 seconds. The following day, Daniel recorded one assist as Team Staal lost the game 11–10. Towards the end of the 2010–11 season, Daniel compiled three goals and five assists in three games to be named the NHL&#x27;s Second Star of the Week on 14 March. During that month, he totalled nine goals and 12 assists in 15 games, earning him NHL Second Star of the Month honours. With a goal on Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick and an assist on a Ryan Kesler goal against the Los Angeles Kings on 31 March, Daniel became the fifth player in team history to reach the 100-point mark in one season (after Pavel Bure, Alexander Mogilny, Markus Näslund and Henrik Sedin). Prior to the Canucks&#x27; final home game of the season a week later against the Minnesota Wild on 7 April, Sedin was awarded the Cyclone Taylor Award as the team&#x27;s most valuable player (MVP) and his third Cyrus H. McLean Award as the team&#x27;s leading point-scorer. Finishing the campaign with a career-high 41 goals, 63 assists and 104 points in all 82 games, he won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s leading point-scorer. It marked the first time in NHL history that brothers led the League in scoring in back-to-back seasons, as Henrik had won the previous year. Chicago Blackhawks forwards Doug and Max Bentley also won separate scoring titles, but had achieved the feat three years apart in 1943 and 1946, respectively. He also received the Viking Award as the NHL&#x27;s best Swedish player, following after Henrik who received it the year before. His 41 goals (and the 41 by teammate Ryan Kesler) led the Canucks as a team in goals and were tied for fourth in the NHL overall only behind Anaheim Ducks&#x27; forward Corey Perry, who led the league with 50 goals, Tampa Bay Lightning&#x27; forward Steven Stamkos with 45 goals and Calgary Flames&#x27; forward and captain Jarome Iginla with 43 goals, respectively. Daniel&#x27;s efforts in the 2010–11 season also helped the Canucks win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the team with the NHL&#x27;s best regular season record for the first in franchise history. Entering the 2011 playoffs, the Canucks beat the defending Stanley Cup champion and eighth-seeded Chicago Blackhawks in seven games along with the fifth-seeded Nashville Predators in six games and the second-seeded San Jose Sharks in five games in the first three rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years. Playing against the Boston Bruins, the Sedins struggled to produce in the Finals; through the series&#x27; seven games, Daniel recorded a goal and three assists for four points while twin brother Henrik recorded a goal and no assists for one point in all seven games in the series. Consequently, the Canucks as a team managed just eight goals in the entire seven game series while the Bruins recorded a combined total of 23 goals within the whole seven game series. After losing Game 6 by a 5–2 score at TD Garden in Boston on 13 June, (a game in which the Canucks had a 3–2 lead in the series and had a chance to clinch the Stanley Cup for themselves with a 4–2 series win if they had won), Daniel told &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; reporters, &quot;We&#x27;re going to win Game 7.&quot; Two days later, they went on to lose the deciding contest 4–0 on home ice against the third-seeded Bruins for a 4–3 defeat in the series, one win short from winning the Stanley Cup. With nine goals and 11 assists for 20 points in all 25 games played, Daniel ranked fourth in playoff scoring behind Boston Bruins&#x27; forward David Krejčí, Henrik Sedin and Tampa Bay Lightning’ forward Martin St. Louis. His 99 shots on goal marked the fifth-highest single playoffs total in NHL history.

On 22 June, a week after the Canucks&#x27; game 7 loss, Daniel was in attendance for the NHL Awards show in Las Vegas, having been nominated for the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player, the Ted Lindsay Award as the NHL&#x27;s most outstanding player and the NHL Foundation Player Award for his and Henrik&#x27;s work in the Vancouver community. Daniel won the Lindsay Award over forwards Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks, respectively. In Hart Trophy voting, he finished as the first runner-up to Perry with 51 first-place ballots and 960 voting points total (16 and 83 fewer than Perry, respectively). Daniel and Henrik also lost the NHL Foundation Award to Los Angeles Kings captain forward Dustin Brown. After being named to the NHL&#x27;s second All-Star team the previous year, Daniel received First Team honours with Henrik for the 2010–11 season. Returning to Sweden in the 2011 off-season, Daniel and Henrik were co-recipients of the Victoria Scholarship, as the country&#x27;s athletes of the year. They became the third and fourth ice hockey players to receive the award, after Stefan Persson in 1980 and Peter Forsberg in 1994. Henrik and Daniel were presented the award, commemorated with glass plates, on 14 July, in the city of Borgholm.

At the midway point of the 2011–12 season, Daniel was named to his second consecutive NHL All-Star Game in 2012. He was one of four players representing the Canucks, including Henrik, Alexander Edler and Cody Hodgson. Chosen to Team Alfredsson in the All-Star fantasy draft, he recorded a goal and an assist in a 12–9 loss to Team Chára. Towards the season, Daniel sustained a concussion after receiving a hit from Chicago Blackhawks defenceman Duncan Keith during a game on 21 March 2012. With Daniel in the neutral zone and without possession of the puck, Keith hit him in the head with his elbow. After being helped off the ice by a trainer, Daniel remained in the game for a shift before leaving the contest entirely. Two days later, Keith was suspended five games for his hit by the League. Sidelined for the remainder of the regular season, Daniel finished 2011–12 with 67 points (30 goals, 37 assists) in 72 games, a drop off from his league-leading total from the previous season. Despite Daniel&#x27;s injury late in the season, the Canucks won their second consecutive Presidents&#x27; Trophy and second Presidents&#x27; Trophy in franchise history altogether. He remained out of the lineup for the first three games of the 2012 playoffs, all of which the Canucks lost against the eighth-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings. Returning for Game 4 on 18 April, Daniel helped the Canucks stave off a four-game sweep and force a fifth game before they were defeated in the fifth game four days later with Kings forward Jarret Stoll&#x27;s overtime-winning goal for a 2–1 loss in the game and a 4–1 defeat in the series. In his two games played in the series, he recorded two assists on goals both scored by Henrik.
Due to another lockout, the 2012–13 season was delayed until January 2013 with an abbreviated 48-game regular season schedule. The Sedins this time remained in Vancouver, as they decided that would return to Modo only if the entire season again wound up cancelled. On 15 February 2013, Henrik recorded his 757th point against the Dallas Stars, surpassing Markus Näslund as the Canucks&#x27; all-time leading scorer. On 22 April, in a 3–1 win against the Chicago Blackhawks, Daniel also passed Näslund by scoring a goal on Blackhawks&#x27; goaltender Corey Crawford and two assists on goals by Henrik and Zack Kassian, ranking both of the Sedins first and second in team history in points, respectively. Playing in 47 games out of 48 game lockout-shortened season, Daniel recorded 12 goals and 28 assists for 40 points as the Canucks as a team finished as the third seed in the West. His 40 points ranked second in team scoring behind Henrik&#x27;s 45 points. In the 2013 playoffs, he added three assists and no goals in a four-game sweep to the San Jose Sharks. Game 4 of the series and the series altogether ended by the San Jose Sharks on a shorthanded goal to due to a penalty assessed to Daniel in overtime to complete the sweep. In pursuit of a loose puck in the defensive zone, Daniel bodychecked Sharks&#x27; forward Tommy Wingels into the boards, resulting in a boarding penalty. The call would later be the subject of controversy as it was believed by many in the media, such as &quot;National Post&quot; journalist Cam Cole, as well as teammates, such as Henrik, that Daniel had made contact with Wingels shoulder-to-shoulder, which according to NHL rules, should not result in a boarding penalty.

At the beginning of the 2013–14 season, the Sedins signed matching four-year, $28 million contract extensions with the Canucks. In 73 games, Daniel had 16 goals and 31 assists for 47 points in 2013–14. The Canucks did not qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2008, as Daniel had a 23-game goal-scoring drought and injured his hamstring during the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators, on 2 March 2014 which forced him to miss nine games. He scored multiple goals in the last game of the season on 13 April. During the second period of that game, a hit by the Calgary Flames&#x27; forward Paul Byron sent Daniel&#x27;s head into the boards and ended his season. He was stretchered off the ice and briefly hospitalised.

On 23 November 2014, Daniel played his 1,000th NHL game against the Chicago Blackhawks, joining Henrik and Trevor Linden as the only players in franchise history to reach that milestone. Daniel scored his 115th power play goal as a member of the Canucks in the third period of a 5–0 victory over the visiting Pittsburgh Penguins on 7 February 2015, giving him the franchise record for power play tallies, which had been held by Näslund. On 6 April, brother Henrik recorded his 700th career assist, setting up a goal by Daniel in a Canucks victory over the Los Angeles Kings. Daniel&#x27;s overall statistical performance in 2014–15 was an improvement on the previous season. In all 82 games, he had 20 goals, 56 assists and a team-high 76 points; the latter figure was good for eighth in the NHL, and earned Daniel the Cyrus H. McLean Award. The goal total exceeded his output in each of the previous two seasons, and he topped 70 points for the first time since 2010–11. The Canucks returned to the playoffs with a second-place finish in their division fifth place finish in the Western Conference after missing the playoffs the year prior. In their first-round series with the Calgary Flames, Daniel scored two goals and had two assists. His goal in the fifth game in the first round gave Vancouver an eventual 2–1 win and extended the team&#x27;s season. Despite his efforts and strong production, the Flames defeated the Canucks in the opening round of the 2015 playoffs in six games.

==== Later years, continued individual success, team difficulties (2015–2018) ====
On 21 November 2015, Daniel recorded his sixth career hat-trick in a 6–3 win against the Chicago Blackhawks, cementing his spot and passing Todd Bertuzzi and Petri Skriko for fifth most hat-tricks in Canucks history and also recorded his 900th career point with an assist on a goal by Henrik. On 11 January 2016, Daniel scored in overtime to give the Canucks a 3–2 victory over the Florida Panthers against Panthers&#x27; goaltender and former teammate Roberto Luongo. The goal was his second of the game and the 346th of his career, tying him with Markus Näslund for the franchise record. Ten days later, Daniel beat Boston Bruins goaltender Tuukka Rask for a third-period goal to become the highest-scoring Canucks player; it was his first of two goals in the 4–2 win over the Bruins. Midway through the 2015–16 season, Daniel was named to the NHL All-Star Game for the third time. He played on a team representing the Pacific Division in a three-on-three tournament. Daniel contributed two goals and an assist in their first game, a 9–6 win over Team Central. In the final against Team Atlantic, he assisted on the only goal of the game in a 1–0 Team Pacific victory. For the 2015–16 campaign, Daniel had 28 goals, 33 assists and 61 points in all 82 games. Despite his continued individual productivity, the Canucks as a team finished 28th in the NHL in points and third-to-last place in the league overall, failing to reach the postseason for the second time in three years as a result.

By the 2016–17 season, their 16th with the Canucks, the Sedins were both 36 years old. They adopted a less aggressive playing style as they sought to reduce the number of risks they took on the ice. The Sedins remained among the top point-scorers on the Canucks; Daniel had 15 goals and 29 assists, and appeared in all 82 games. His total of 44 points was the fewest Daniel had tallied since the 2002–03 season. The Canucks&#x27; 69 points left them 25 behind the final playoff qualifier in their conference. 

The Sedins remained with the Canucks in 2017–18, with their contracts set to expire at the end of the season. Daniel said that he and Henrik hoped to retire with the franchise. On 30 November 2017, Daniel reached the 1,000-point milestone by scoring a power play goal in a 5–3 win against the Nashville Predators against goaltender Pekka Rinne, joining Henrik as the only players to gain 1,000 points in the Canucks organization. A pregame ceremony in his honour was held on 2 December. On 2 April 2018, Daniel and Henrik announced that they would be retiring at the end of the season in a letter thanking the Canucks organization and their fans. On 5 April, the Sedins played their final game in Rogers Arena against the Arizona Coyotes. In their last home game, Daniel recorded two goals including the game winner, both of which Henrik assisted on, to defeat the Arizona Coyotes 4–3 at 2:23 in overtime. Daniel played his final game on 7 April, in a 3–2 shootout loss to the Edmonton Oilers; he retired alongside his brother Henrik at the end of the 2017–18 season after 17 seasons and 1,306 regular season games with the Vancouver Canucks. Despite their retirement, the Sedin brothers were named finalists for the King Clancy Trophy, awarded to the player who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and gives back to his community, which they won on 20 June. The two brothers shared the award, becoming the first brothers in NHL history to share the King Clancy Trophy.

== Post playing career ==
On 12 February 2020, Daniel&#x27;s number 22 would be raised to the rafters alongside his brother Henrik&#x27;s number 33 in an hour-long jersey retirement ceremony, the culmination of a week-long celebration of the twins&#x27; careers.

On 22 June 2021, it was announced that Henrik and Daniel would join the Canucks Hockey Operations department and were named Special Advisors to the General Manager. 

On 30 May 2022, the Canucks announced that the Sedins had transitioned into new roles with player development, working daily on and off the ice with young players in Vancouver and Abbotsford.

On 28 June 2022, it was announced that Daniel would join his brother Henrik in being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame later that year, together becoming the first career Canucks to make it to the hall.

== International play ==





Daniel made his North American debut competing for Sweden in the 1997 World U17 Hockey Challenge, held in Alberta. Leading the tournament in scoring with 26 points (nine goals and 17 assists) over six games, he helped Sweden to a silver medal. After going undefeated in five contests, they were defeated in the gold medal game by Team Ontario, 6–2.

Back in Europe, Daniel competed at the 1997 European Junior Championships, recording two goals and six points over six games. The following year, at the 1998 European Junior Championships, Sweden&#x27;s final game required them to beat Russia by four goals to surpass Finland in goal differential and win the gold medal. Daniel recorded two assists as Sweden won 5–1.

In his NHL draft year, Daniel competed for Sweden at the 1999 World Junior Championships in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He recorded ten points in six games, and tied for second in tournament scoring with Daniel Tkaczuk of Canada and Scott Gomez of the United States, behind Brian Gionta of the United States. Sweden failed to medal, losing the bronze medal game against Slovakia by a score of 5–4. Later that year, Daniel made his debut for the Swedish men&#x27;s team at the 1999 World Championships in Norway. He notched one assist over nine games as Sweden won the bronze medal.

In 2000, Daniel once again competed in both the World Junior and Men&#x27;s Championships. At the junior tournament in Sweden, Daniel matched his previous year&#x27;s output with 10 points. He was the third highest point-scorer in the tournament, behind Henrik and Milan Kraft of the Czech Republic. Again, Sweden failed to earn a medal, finishing in fifth place. At the Men&#x27;s World Championships, Daniel and Henrik both recorded five points; they were the youngest players on the squad. Sweden did not achieve a medal, however, losing to Finland in the tournament quarterfinal.
Following his rookie season with the Canucks, Daniel made his third World Championships appearance, in 2001 in Germany. He was injured midway through the tournament and had to return to Vancouver for surgery on a herniated disc in his lower back. Sweden defeated the United States 3–2 to win its second bronze medal in three years. He made a fourth tournament appearance at the 2005 World Championships in Austria. Sweden missed out on the bronze medal, losing to Russia, 6–3. Daniel had an assist in a losing effort during the bronze medal game. He finished with nine points in nine games, which tied for fourth in tournament-scoring.

On 22 December 2005, Daniel was named to the Swedish Olympic team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He joined Henrik, Markus Näslund and Mattias Öhlund as one of four Canucks on the squad. Competing in his first Olympics, he contributed four points as Sweden won a gold medal, defeating Finland 3–2 in the final. Four years later, he was once again named to the Swedish Olympic team for the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Despite going into the tournament as one of Sweden&#x27;s key players (in the corresponding NHL season, he was third among Swedish players in points despite missing 19 games), he ranked seventh among team forwards in total ice time. Sweden failed to defend their gold medal from Turin, losing to Slovakia in the quarterfinal. Daniel had a goal and two assists in four games.

After the Canucks were defeated in the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, Daniel joined his brother in appearing at the 2013 World Championships in their home country. The Sedins helped lead Sweden to the gold medal match, where they won 5–1 over Switzerland. In four games, Daniel had six points, including four assists on power play goals during the single-elimination rounds. Daniel represented Sweden at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, while his brother did not attend due to health concerns. He played in all six of Sweden&#x27;s games, scoring a goal and four assists as the Swedes ultimately lost to Canada in the gold medal game. In 2016, the Sedins participated in the World Cup of Hockey, playing together on Sweden&#x27;s first line. Team Europe eliminated Sweden in the semifinal round, 3–2 in overtime. Daniel contributed two assists in four games.

== Playing style ==

Throughout his career, Daniel has been known as a goal-scorer, usually finishing plays initiated by his brother, Henrik, who was known as a playmaker. However, Daniel is also a proficient like Henrik and generates many sequences with Henrik off the . Daniel&#x27;s familiarity with Henrik&#x27;s play enhances his effectiveness; the pair are known for their ability to find each other intuitively with passes, often without looking.

With offensive skill marking the prime component of his game, Daniel is known to avoid initiating contact with opposing players. Early in their careers, he and Henrik were knocked off the puck easily. As a result, players have often taken advantage of their lack of physicality by playing aggressively against them. This once led Canucks general manager Brian Burke to publicly complain, commenting during a 2002 playoff series against the Detroit Red Wings, &quot;&#x27;Sedin&#x27; is not Swedish for &#x27;punch me or headlock me in a scrum.&#x27;&quot; As their careers progressed, the Sedins have worked on their strength, improving their puck possession, allowing them to play more effectively and with increased physicality.

== Personal life ==
Daniel met his wife Marinette in his hometown Örnsköldsvik around 1998. She came with him to Vancouver upon the start of Daniel&#x27;s NHL career in 2000, and the two married in 2005. After earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology at the University of British Columbia Marinette became involved with the Canucks Family Education Centre, helping female immigrants transition to the English language. Together, they have two daughters, Ronja (born in 2005) and Anna (born in March 2011), and a son, Erik (born in 2008). They live in the Vancouver neighbourhood of West Point Grey during the NHL season, returning to Sweden every summer.

In March 2010, Daniel and Marinette made a joint $1.5 million donation with Henrik and his wife Johanna to the BC Children&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;s $200 million project for a new building. The two families requested that it be put towards a pediatric intensive-care unit and a diagnostic imaging area.

Daniel and Henrik are devoted harness racing fans and race horse owners. Their most successful trotter so far is the 2013 Elitloppet winner Nahar.

<text>The Northern Tier is a geographic region consisting of five rural counties in north-central Pennsylvania.

==Geography==

The region is bordered to the north by the Southern Tier of New York state. Together, these regions are known as the Twin Tiers.

The counties and important towns in the Northern Tier are:
*Bradford
**Athens
**Sayre
**Towanda
*Sullivan
**Dushore
**Laporte
*Susquehanna
**Forest City
**Montrose
**New Milford
*Tioga
**Mansfield
**Wellsboro
*Wyoming
**Tunkhannock

The region is bounded to the north by the Southern Tier of New York, to the west by Northern Pennsylvania, and to the east by Northeastern Pennsylvania.

==Population==

The five Northern Tier counties are home to roughly 180,000 people distributed among many small towns and the countryside.

The largest town is Sayre which is located on the left-east bank of the North Branch Susquehanna River and is on Interstate 86 where it dips just south of the New York state line.

==Transportation==

U.S. Route 220, U.S. Route 15 and U.S. Route 6 cross the region.

Sayre Yard is a large railyard currently operated by Norfolk Southern Railroad that extends across the state line into Waverly, New York and connects rail transport centers via Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, to freight yards in Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and Baltimore to Buffalo and other Upstate New York cities as well as the Great Lakes basin cities.

==Notable features==

The Endless Mountains are a major geographic feature of the eastern counties.

==Education==

The region is home to Mansfield University of Pennsylvania, located in Mansfield.

==Economy==

The Northern Tier region as a whole is notorious for its high unemployment and low per-capita incomes in comparison to the rest of Pennsylvania, though the discovery of the Marcellus Formation provided an economic boost in the 2000s and 2010s. The region&#x27;s top two employers are government-funded services, specifically health care and education services.

Agriculture is an important activity in the region despite the short growing season and hilly terrain. Small-scale beef and dairy farming is common, and there are many small-scale producers of maple syrup in the region.

Production of crude oil and natural gas are important to the local economy. The characteristics of Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil make it especially desirable for high-end uses.

Logging, forest product industries and paper product industries are significant parts of the region&#x27;s economy.

Agriculture and light manufacturing are also important employers.

<doc id="551604" wikidata="Q3374172" url="?curid=551604" title="Pee-wee Herman">
<text>Pee-wee Herman is a comedy character created and portrayed by the American comedian Paul Reubens. He starred in films and television series during the 1980s. The childlike Pee-wee Herman character developed as a stage act that quickly led to an HBO special in 1981. As the stage performance gained further popularity, Reubens took the character to motion picture with &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; in 1985, toning down the adult innuendo for the appeal of children. This paved the way for &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, an Emmy Award-winning children&#x27;s series that ran on CBS from 1986 to 1991. Another film, &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot;, was released in 1988.

Because of negative media attention following a scandal in 1991, Reubens decided to shelve his alter ego during the 1990s, but gradually resurrected it during the following decade. It was at that time that Reubens addressed plans to write a new Pee-wee film, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse: The Movie.&quot; In June 2007, Reubens appeared as Pee-wee Herman at the Spike TV&#x27;s Guys&#x27; Choice Awards for the first time on television since 1992. After a lengthy hiatus, a third film, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Holiday&quot;, was released by Netflix in 2016 and was the last time Reubens portrayed the character before his death in 2023.

==Origin==
In the 1970s, Reubens joined the Los Angeles–based improvisational comedy team the Groundlings and remained a member for six years, working with Bob McClurg, John Paragon, Susan Barnes and Phil Hartman. Hartman and Reubens became close friends, often writing and working on material together. Reubens wrote sketches, developed his improvisational skills and, with Hartman, he developed the Pee-wee Herman character.

In 1977, The Groundlings staged a performance in which its members created characters one might see in a comedy club. Reubens decided to play a guy that everyone immediately knew would never make it as a comic, partly because Reubens could not remember jokes in real life – he had trouble remembering punch lines and could not properly piece information in sequential order. Pee-wee Herman was born that night, his distinctive guttural &quot;Ha Ha&quot;, followed by a low, &quot;Heh Heh Heh&quot; laugh became the character&#x27;s catch phrase, as did his insult comeback, &quot;I know you are, but what am I?&quot;

Pee-wee Herman&#x27;s signature gray glen plaid suit was originally a custom-made suit that Reubens had borrowed from the Groundlings director, Gary Austin; the small red bow tie was given to him by an acquaintance. Pee-wee&#x27;s later checkered clothing and persona were largely lifted from manic 1950s children&#x27;s TV host Pinky Lee. Also incorporated into the look were short black hair, pale skin with red rouge and red lipstick.

The inspiration for the name came from a Pee-wee brand miniature harmonica and the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. Reubens thought the name Pee-wee Herman was a name that sounded too real to be made up, and like a real name a parent would give a child that they didn&#x27;t really care about.

Sometime in 1979, Reubens debuted his character on the television show &quot;The Dating Game&quot;, appearing three times.

===Character background and personality===
Throughout his film and television programs, Pee-wee Herman&#x27;s background has remained relatively ambiguous. During interviews, he has been portrayed as though he is a real life stand-up comedian who expanded his career by playing himself in his films and TV series. This is echoed by the fact that a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was awarded to Pee-wee Herman rather than Paul Reubens.

In both &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; and &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, the character surrounds himself with strange inventions and decorations and has no visible means of support, whereas &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; depicts him as a farmer/inventor. During a July 1983 segment on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, Pee-wee said he has a sister named Hermione who was a Girl Scout, his mother&#x27;s name is Honny Herman, and his father&#x27;s name is Herman Herman. He went on to say that everyone in his family has a first name that begins with an &quot;H&quot; except for him. This was again stated during a 1988 special which elaborated that Pee-wee was raised in Florida.

Pee-wee is commonly portrayed as an impatient and fun-loving child with dainty, effeminate mannerisms and quirky facial expressions. His age has never been explicitly stated; although, he once proclaimed on &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m the luckiest boy in the world.&quot; David Letterman once said of the character, &quot;What makes me laugh ... is that it has the external structure of a bratty little precocious kid, but you know it&#x27;s being controlled by the incubus – the manifestation of evil itself.&quot; While the character is typically cheerful and flamboyant, Pee-wee has indeed displayed an aggressive side, including his vicious pool battle with Francis in &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. He also played vengeful tricks in the aforementioned film and occasionally threw childish tantrums on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse.&quot; Reubens said that he feels Pee-wee &quot;resets&quot; after each adventure, his experiences only changing him slightly, and compared him to Dorothy Gale at the end of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.

==1980–1992==

===&quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;===

Paul Reubens auditioned for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the 1980–81 season but was not accepted into the cast. Instead, he started a stage show with the Herman character, which made one of his first appearances in the 1980 film &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Next Movie.&quot; He first plays a rude receptionist in the film, spewing obscenities at police and being arrested. The character is later introduced as Pee-wee Herman, approaching the stage just before disputing with the film&#x27;s title characters again. Shortly after the film, Reubens took Pee-wee to the real stage. Originally, Reubens imbued Pee-wee with sexuality that was later toned down as the character made the transition from raucous night club to children&#x27;s television (though innuendo was still apparent, particularly between the Cowboy Curtis and Miss Yvonne characters). The stage show was popularized by HBO when &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot; aired in 1981.

The show featured the writing and acting of Groundlings alumni Phil Hartman and John Paragon, who would both reprise their characters on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse.&quot; &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot; played for five sellout months at The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles, whereupon HBO filmed it and aired it as a special on September 11, 1981.

Following the success of &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;, in the early and mid-1980s Reubens made several guest appearances on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; as Pee-wee Herman. These performances gave Pee-wee an even bigger following than he had with his HBO special. In 1983, Pee-wee Herman traveled the United States with &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;, making highly publicized stops at the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis and Caroline&#x27;s in New York City.

In 1984, Pee-wee Herman sold out New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. Reubens said his appearances on David Letterman&#x27;s show made Pee-wee a star.

===&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;===
While on the Warner Bros. lot, Reubens noticed that most of the people rode around on bicycles and asked when he would get his. Warner Bros. presented him with a refurbished 1940s Schwinn; Reubens then abandoned the Pee-wee Herman script he had been writing, which was to have been a retelling of &quot;Pollyanna.&quot; He began writing about Herman&#x27;s love for his bike and his efforts to locate it once it was stolen. Hartman, Reubens and Michael Varhol co-wrote the script for &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, basing the story loosely on Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;. The film was directed by Tim Burton, his feature film debut, and scored by Danny Elfman. It was released on August 9, 1985, and, while receiving mixed reviews, performed well at the box office and became a cult film. Reubens was the originator of the &quot;Pee-wee dance&quot; in the movie, and he had performed it publicly many times prior to making the film.

Pee-wee hosted the 198th episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on November 23, 1985. Phil Hartman, who would become an &quot;SNL&quot; cast member the following year, was credited for writing the &quot;Pee-wee Herman Thanksgiving Special&quot; sketch and appeared as a pilgrim in it.

===&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;===
The following year, Pee-wee (along with Hartman) found a home on the small screen with the Saturday morning children&#x27;s program &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; on the American CBS network for the next five years (Shirley Stoler, Johann Carlo, Gilbert Lewis and Roland Rodriguez appeared only for the first 13 episodes before their characters were dropped or recast). The show starred Pee-wee living in his wild and wacky Playhouse, full of talking chairs, animals, robots and other puppet and human characters. The show became a hit, and during its time on the air, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; garnered 15 Emmy Awards.

Pee-wee also became the first guest on &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot; on its October 9, 1986, premiere. The following year, he made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Back to the Beach.&quot; Reubens also filmed an insert for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as Pee-wee, reciting his own version of the alphabet. In 1987, Pee-wee appeared on the hit primetime sitcom &quot;227&quot; alongside Marla Gibbs and Jackée Harry. The following year, a sequel to &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot;, was filmed. That same year &quot;Pee-wee&quot; was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and starred in &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse Christmas Special&quot;. The program included various celebrity guests, including Oprah Winfrey, Cher, Whoopi Goldberg, Grace Jones, Little Richard and Joan Rivers among others.

===Reubens&#x27; 1991 arrest===
In July 1991, while visiting relatives, Reubens was arrested in Sarasota, Florida, for masturbating publicly in an adult theater. Detectives would periodically visit pornographic theaters and observe the audience, arresting those engaged in what these detectives considered indecent exposure. Three other men were also arrested that night on similar charges. Reubens&#x27; infamous mug shot, which did not depict the clean-cut look Reubens had shown for the last decade, shocked the public, and many thought that the show had been canceled due to the arrest. In reality, the show had been canceled in 1990 due to a combination of multiple complaints of overworked crew members and a feeling that the Pee-wee character had run its course, which ultimately resulted in Reubens deciding against a sixth season. However, due to its widespread popularity, CBS elected to rerun &quot;Playhouse&quot; in syndication. The arrest was widely covered, and both the character Pee-wee and Reubens became the subject of ridicule. CBS stopped airing &quot;Playhouse&quot; and Disney-MGM Studios suspended from its studio tour a video that showed Pee-wee explaining how voice-over tracks were made and Toys &quot;R&quot; Us removed Pee-wee toys from its stores. However, Disney&#x27;s &quot;Star Tours&quot;, which featured voicework from Reubens, remained unaltered.

Despite the negative publicity, many artists who knew Reubens, such as Cyndi Lauper, Annette Funicello, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Valeria Golino, spoke out in his support. Bill Cosby defended Reubens, saying &quot;Whatever (Reubens has) done, this is being blown all out of proportion.&quot; Other people who knew Reubens, such as &quot;Playhouse&quot;&#x27;s production designer Gary Panter, S. Epatha Merkerson and &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; director Randal Kleiser, also spoke out against the way Reubens was being treated by the media. Reubens&#x27;s fans also organized rallies of support after CBS canceled the scheduled reruns, with several dozens of &quot;Pee-weeites&quot; picketing in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. The general public also appeared to sympathize with Reubens – the TV newsmagazine &quot;A Current Affair&quot; received &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of responses to a Pee-wee telephone survey, with callers supporting Reubens with a 9-to-1 majority. He remained in a state of shock for weeks and was haunted by the arrest for several years, refusing to give interviews or appear on talk shows.

At the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards, Reubens made his first public appearance after the arrest. Taking the stage in costume as Pee-wee, he asked the audience, &quot;Heard any good jokes lately?&quot; and received a standing ovation. Reubens responded with, &quot;Ha, that&#x27;s so funny I forgot to laugh!&quot; Pee-wee appeared once more in 1992, when he participated in a Grand Ole Opry tribute to Minnie Pearl. Reubens then avoided interviews and, according to a 1991 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article, had become weary of the character and wanted to explore new territory.

==1999–2023==
===Appearances and television returns===
During the filming of &quot;Mystery Men&quot;, Reubens appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; in 1999 in one of his first out-of-character interviews. It was also on that interview that Reubens first announced plans to start writing a new Pee-wee movie. In a 2004 interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Reubens also mentioned his hope that Hollywood has not seen the last of Pee-wee. Reubens later stated a strong possibility of a &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; movie on an NPR interview with Terry Gross on November 29, 2004. A third Pee-wee movie was also suggested. During this time, Reubens stated both were actively being worked on.

In 1998, Fox Family aired reruns of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. On July 10, 2006, Cartoon Network began airing &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; during its Adult Swim lineup. The show&#x27;s 45 original episodes were planned to air on the block Monday to Thursday at 11 p.m. ET starting on that date. Later on in August 2006, Adult Swim started airing &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; at 12 a.m. ET.

In October 2006, Reubens made a public appearance, dressed as Pee-wee at Chiller Theatre Expo, an East Coast fan convention, with &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; co-star, Lynne Marie Stewart. There he signed pictures and other memorabilia, and posed for photographs with fans.

At Spike TV&#x27;s 2007 Guys&#x27; Choice Awards in June, Reubens appeared on TV as the Pee-wee Herman character for the first time since 1992. On August 5, 2007, at a showing of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Reubens made an appearance on stage before the show, bringing with him almost the entire cast of the film to uproarious applause and a standing ovation. E. G. Daily (Dotty), Judd Omen (Mickey), Diane Salinger (Simone), Daryl Keith Roach (Chuck, the bike shop owner), and Mark Holton (Francis) were all present.

On January 15, 2011, Reubens appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as Pee-wee in an extended and well-received segment depicting Andy Samberg and Pee-wee getting drunk, taking a ride on a mechanical bull, doing the tequila dance and ambushing Anderson Cooper in an alley way with a chair.

On February 1, 2012, Reubens appeared as Pee-wee on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Top Chef: Texas&quot; and served as guest judge. Part of the contestants&#x27; challenge was to ride a bike, similar to Pee-wee&#x27;s, while gathering ingredients through San Antonio to prepare and serve a special lunch for Pee-wee at the Alamo. The use of The Alamo is a reference to Pee-wee&#x27;s film, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, where his stolen bike is allegedly hidden. While taping the Top Chef episode on the Alamo complex, author and Alamo spokesman Tony J. Caridi led Reubens on a guided tour of the basement on the Alamo grounds, which is used to store gift shop merchandise.

===Proposed films===
====&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse: The Movie&quot;====
&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse: The Movie&quot; is a proposed film allegedly greenlit by Paramount Pictures. Reubens&#x27;s third scripted movie, written at the same time as his adult-oriented Pee-wee script, was announced in late summer 2006. He first announced he had finished the script on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and later revealed further details to &quot;Time&quot; magazine reporter Dennis Van Tine. Filming was expected to start in early 2007.

According to Reubens, the story will focus on the characters from the television show finally leaving the playhouse and venturing off into Puppetland and beyond (the playhouse characters had rarely left their home in the TV series). The characters from the playhouse will be on an epic adventure to look for a missing character from the playhouse. Reubens stated this will be a &quot;road&quot; movie. Reubens said that, although he feels confident that he can still portray Pee-wee himself, he would optionally cast Johnny Depp if needed. He said &quot;My second option is to have Johnny Depp play Pee-wee.&quot; He said he spoke to Depp himself and that the actor asked for time to think about it.

During the 2011 Comic-Con in San Diego, Reubens told MTV that he hoped to have Justin Bieber make a cameo appearance toward the end of the movie. He also stated that filming of the movie had not started yet, but hoped to begin filming in the next couple of months.

====&quot;The Pee-wee Herman Story&quot;====
Years before working on his &quot;Playhouse&quot; film script, Reubens had written a script for &quot;the dark Pee-wee film&quot;, but &quot;not really very dark&quot;, entitled &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Story&quot;. At a Groundlings reunion in 1999, Reubens even joked about the rating of the movie being &quot;probably PG-13 or even R&quot; but in a 2007 MTV interview stated that this was not the case. He called it a &quot;&quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; Pee-wee&quot; because &quot;it has things certainly inspired by, if not outright lifted from, that movie&quot;. Reubens described the film&#x27;s plot to MTV:

It was because of the adult situations of this script that Reubens sat down and started writing the &quot;Playhouse&quot; movie script. At first, Reubens was going to do the adult Pee-wee movie first, but within a few months, Reubens announced that it was very likely that the &quot;Playhouse&quot; movie would be made first.

A third idea came about to make a reality-based Pee-wee film like those in the 1980s. In 2010, Reubens announced he is working on making this version with Judd Apatow, who wrote and directed the films &quot;Knocked Up&quot; and &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot;.

In 2013, Reubens reported that Pee-Wee will soon return with a new film which he plans to start shooting in 2014. While promoting his voice role in &quot;The Smurfs 2&quot;, Reubens told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on the long-gestating project, saying the film has funding, a finished script, and a director lined up. Reubens was said to be developing a new TV show, which he commented would potentially be an update on the popular &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. He added that a more detailed announcement was &quot;imminent&quot;. Reubens said, &quot;Short of something unforeseen like the studio going out of business, I think it&#x27;s very likely both these projects will happen next year.&quot; In 2014, it was announced that the film would be on Netflix.

===&quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot; revival===
Paul Reubens confirmed in a January 2009 interview with &quot;Swindle&quot; magazine that there are indeed negotiations under way for the Pee-wee Herman stage show to return.

In late 2009, Reubens began promoting his new live stage show. He appeared in character as Pee-wee on late night programs including &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Pee-wee would also return for a cameo on the penultimate episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Conan O&#x27;Brien as host and during O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s stop at Radio City Music Hall in New York City for The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour.

Original plans for a November 2009 stage debut were scrapped when demand for tickets prompted a move to a larger theater. The &quot;Pee-wee Herman Stage Show: The Return&quot; opened on January 12, 2010, at Club Nokia in Los Angeles for a limited four-week schedule. The show moved to Broadway in New York at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre on November 11, 2010. Much like the original stage show, the new production revolved around Pee-wee&#x27;s desire to fly. It had 11 actors, 20 puppets and marked the show&#x27;s first production since 1982. It employed many of the same set artists and the musical composer from Pee-wee&#x27;s original stage show as well as some of the original cast members, including Lynne Stewart as Miss Yvonne, John Moody as Mailman Mike and John Paragon as Jambi the Genie. Reubens cited his desire to make a film version of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; and expressed a desire to &quot;introduce Pee-wee to the new generation that didn&#x27;t know about it&quot;.

Pee-wee&#x27;s 2010 stage show received positive reviews from various Los Angeles–based publications, including the &quot;Orange County Register&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

To promote his Broadway show, Pee-wee Herman guest starred on the November 1, 2010, edition of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; at the Nassau Coliseum. During the program, he participated in backstage antics and had an in-ring confrontation with The Miz and Alex Riley. Pee-wee won a Slammy Award for Guest Star Shining Moment of the Year on December 13, 2010, for his appearance. Pee-wee Herman returned to WWE at WrestleMania XXVII in a segment with The Rock and Gene Okerlund in which he admitted to being John Cena&#x27;s number one fan.

===&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Holiday&quot;===

After Reubens started giving interviews again after his 1991 arrest, he talked about the two scripts he had written for future Pee-wee Herman films. Reubens once called his first script &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Story&quot;, describing it as a black comedy. He also referred to the script as &quot;dark Pee-wee&quot; or &quot;adult Pee-wee&quot;, with the plot involving Pee-wee becoming famous as a singer after making a hit single and moving to Hollywood, where &quot;he does everything wrong and becomes a big jerk&quot;. Reubens further explained the film has many &quot;&quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; moments&quot;. Reubens thought this script would be the first one to start production, but in 2006 Reubens announced he was to start filming his second script in 2007.

The second film, a family friendly adventure, is called &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse: The Movie&quot; by Reubens, and follows Pee-wee and his &quot;Playhouse&quot; friends on a road-trip adventure, meaning that they would leave the house for the first time and go out into &quot;Puppetland&quot;. All of the original characters of the show, live-action and puppets, are included in Reubens&#x27; script. The story happens in a fantasy land that would be reminiscent of &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; and &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. In January 2009, Reubens told Gary Panter that the rejected first script of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; (which they co-wrote) could have a movie deal very soon, and that it would be &quot;90 minutes of incredible beauty&quot;. In December 2009, while in character, Reubens said this film is &quot;already done, the script is already fully written; It&#x27;s ready to shoot.&quot; Most of the film will take place in Puppetland and claymation might be used.

Reubens said one of the two films opens in prison. He also said that using CGI for &quot;updating&quot; the puppets&#x27; looks could be an option, but it all depended on the budget the films would have. Reubens once mentioned the possibility of doing one of the two as an animated film along the lines of &quot;The Polar Express&quot;, which uses performance capture technology, incorporating the movements of live actors into animated characters. Reubens approached &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; director Tim Burton with one of the scripts and talked to Johnny Depp about the possibility of having him portray Pee-wee, but they both declined.

In June 2010, it was announced that Paul Reubens was working with Judd Apatow on a new Pee-wee Herman feature film set up at Universal Pictures, with Reubens and Paul Rust set to write the script. In an October 2014, interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Reubens gave an update on the status of the film, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s been months and months of being right on the verge of being announced…I thought something was going to go public yesterday, actually, and that you&#x27;d be the first person I&#x27;d be talking about this with. But I&#x27;m thinking there will be something made public very soon. It&#x27;s going to get made shortly after the new year. I wish I could tell you about it right now, because…I mean, it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s going to be amazing. It think it first got leaked four years ago or so that the movie was going to be made, and ever since then it&#x27;s just been stalling and stalling. So I&#x27;m really ready for this to happen. But I&#x27;m not kidding: It&#x27;s very imminent.&quot;

In a November 2014, interview with &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Reubens explained why the film took so long to be made, saying: &quot;I think part of what happened with this project is it got leaked probably a year and a half or two years before we really wanted anyone to know about it. I was doing a Q&amp;A somewhere, and I said I was writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, &quot;Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?&quot; The whole thing got leaked and we had just started. We didn&#x27;t have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year andI don&#x27;t really know the answer. I think two years of it was like premature information out there, and then the last two years it&#x27;s just been very, very slow to get the right people involved, and we now have such an amazing company involved, and that&#x27;s the really big announcement that hasn&#x27;t been made yet.&quot;

On December 22, 2014, it was announced that the film would premiere exclusively on Netflix. On February 24, 2015, Netflix announced the film would be titled &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Holiday&quot; with Apatow and Reubens producing the film, John Lee directing, and Reubens and Paul Rust writing the screenplay. On March 11, 2015, Tara Buck joined the cast of the film. Principal photography began on March 16, 2015. On April 8, 2015, Joe Manganiello joined the cast. On April 19, 2015, Jessica Pohly was cast in the film.

The film released on March 18, 2016 on Netflix to positive reception. The film was the last time Reubens portrayed the character before his death in 2023.

==Honors==
The Pee-wee Herman character has received various honors, particularly during his peak fame in the late 1980s.

During the original run of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, the series garnered 22 Emmy Awards nominations. As pictured, in 1985 he received &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; Elmer Award for lifetime achievement in comedy. In 1988, Pee-wee Herman was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; under the category of motion pictures, it can be found at 6562 Hollywood Blvd. At the 2012 TV Land Awards, he won the Pop Culture award.

==In popular culture==
The character appeared on three covers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, including issue 493 (February 1987), 614 (October 1991) with a cover story of &quot;Who Killed Pee-wee Herman?&quot;, and finally 619/620 (December 1991) for the 1991 Yearbook.

In the film &quot;Flight of the Navigator&quot; (1986), directed by Randal Kleiser, who would later direct &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot;, Pee-wee&#x27;s characteristic laugh is uttered several times by the Trimaxian Drone (Max, voiced by Reubens), after he &quot;contracted&quot; emotions and 1980s knowledge from David. This persona, speaking in altered pitch similar to Pee-wee&#x27;s, persists for the rest of the movie, a stark contrast to Max&#x27;s original HAL 9000-esque tone.

In the film &quot;Overboard&quot; (1987), the Joey Proffitt character, played by Jeffrey Wiseman, frequently talked in Pee-wee&#x27;s voice and did his characteristic laugh several times during the film. Although it wasn’t intended in the original script, since the film’s director, Garry Marshall allowed his cast to improvise, Wiseman was allowed to speak in Pee-wee&#x27;s voice. 

Shortly after Reubens&#x27;s 1991 arrest, Jim Carrey impersonated Pee-wee Herman on the FOX sketch comedy series &quot;In Living Color&quot;. Later, rapper Eminem imitated Herman in the song &quot;Just Lose It&quot;, copying his trademark laugh and even dressing as the character in the music video. Eminem later also mentioned Herman in &quot;Ass Like That&quot;.

While the Pee-wee Herman character had not originally been intended for a child audience, during the mid-1980s Reubens started forming him into the best role model he possibly could, making of his TV program a morally positive show that cared about issues like racial diversity, the four food groups, and the dangers of making prank calls, but in a manner not overly preachy. Reubens was also careful about what should be associated with Pee-wee. Being a heavy smoker, he went to great lengths never to be photographed with a cigarette in his mouth. He even refused to endorse candy bars and other kinds of junk food, while trying to develop his own sugar-free cereal, &quot;Pee-Wee Chow&quot;, a product that would have been produced by Ralston Purina; Pee-Wee Chow never made it to market after failing a blind test.

During this time, he began successfully building a Pee-wee franchise with toys, clothes, and other items, generating more than $25 million at its peak in 1989. Reubens also published a book as Pee-wee, titled &quot;Travels with Pee-wee&quot; (1989).

In early 2007, Nike SB released a style of sneakers called Grey/Heather Dunk High Pro SB that use a grey and white color scheme with red detail inspired by the colors of Pee-wee&#x27;s trademark suit, and an illustration on the insole suggesting Reubens&#x27;s theater arrest.

<doc id="551608" wikidata="Q375550" url="?curid=551608" title="Henrik Sedin">
<text>Henrik Lars Sedin (born 26 September 1980) is a Swedish ice hockey executive and former centre who played his entire 17-season National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Vancouver Canucks from 2000 to 2018. He additionally served as the Canucks&#x27; captain from 2010 until his retirement. Born and raised in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, Sedin and his identical twin brother Daniel played together throughout their careers; the pair were renowned for their effectiveness as a tandem. Henrik, a skilled passer, was known as a playmaker (150+ more career NHL assists than Daniel) while Daniel was known as a goal-scorer (150+ more career NHL goals than Henrik). Sedin tallied 240 goals and 830 assists, for 1,070 points, in 1,330 NHL games, ranking him as the Canucks&#x27; all-time leading points scorer.

Sedin began his career in the Swedish Hockey League with Modo Hockey in 1997 and was co-recipient, with brother Daniel, of the 1999 Guldpucken as Swedish player of the year. Selected third overall—one pick after brother Daniel—by the Canucks in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft, Sedin spent his entire NHL career in Vancouver. After four seasons with the club, he became the Canucks&#x27; top-scoring centre in 2005–06. He has since won three Cyrus H. McLean Trophies as the team&#x27;s leading point-scorer (from 2007–08 to 2009–10) and one Cyclone Taylor Award as the team&#x27;s most valuable player (2010). In 2009–10, he won the Hart Memorial Trophy as well as the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player and leading point-scorer, respectively. He was also named to the NHL first All-Star team that year and again in 2010–11, a season that included an appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals, where Vancouver lost to the Boston Bruins in seven games. That summer, Henrik and Daniel were named co-recipients of the Victoria Scholarship as Swedish athletes of the year. Alongside his brother, Henrik was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2022.

Internationally, Sedin has competed on Sweden&#x27;s national ice hockey team. He is a two-time Olympian and helped Sweden to a gold medal at the 2006 Winter Games in Turin. In five appearances at the IIHF World Championships, he has won bronze medals in 1999 and 2001 and clinched the world title in 2013. At the junior level, he appeared in one World U17 Hockey Challenge (where he won silver), two European Junior and three World Junior Championships.

== Early life ==
Henrik was born on 26 September 1980 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, six minutes before his identical twin brother, Daniel. The pair have two older brothers, Stefan and Peter. Their father, Tommy, is a school vice principal who played for Modo Hockey in the 1960s; their mother, Tora, is a nurse. Henrik began playing organized hockey with Daniel when they were eight. They did not regularly play on the same line until Daniel switched from centre to wing at the age of 14. Henrik and Daniel attended high school at Nolaskolan Gymnasium in their hometown in Sweden while playing professionally for Modo Hockey.

== Playing career ==

=== Modo Hockey (1997–2000) ===
Aged 16, Henrik and Daniel Sedin began their professional careers in 1997–98 with Modo Hockey of the Swedish Hockey League. Henrik recorded a goal and five points over 39 games during his rookie season. In his second year with Modo, he improved to 12 goals and 34 points, joint second in team scoring with Samuel Påhlsson, behind Daniel. At the end of the season, Henrik and Daniel were named co-recipients of the Guldpucken, the Swedish player of the year award.

The Sedins were considered top prospects for the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. Rated as the top European prospects, they were expected to be top five selections and expressed a desire to play for the same team. Their agent, Mike Barnett, president of international talent agency IMG, presented them with two options to circumvent the usual NHL draft process, allowing them to play together. The first option was for the pair to enter the 1999 draft and not sign with their respective NHL clubs for two years, allowing them to become unrestricted free agents. This option required that they play junior ice hockey in North America, which was not their intention. Barnett also suggested that either Henrik or Daniel opt out of the 1999 draft, in the hope that the same team that selected the first twin would select the other the following year. On the possibility of the Sedins&#x27; playing for separate teams, Vancouver Canucks scout Thomas Gradin commented, &quot;They&#x27;re good enough to play with anyone, but separately their capacity might decrease by 10 or 15 percent.&quot; Nevertheless, Henrik and Daniel both entered the 1999 draft expecting to be selected by separate teams. However, then-Canucks general manager Brian Burke already possessed the third overall pick and through a series of transactions he obtained the second overall pick. He used these second and third overall picks to select Daniel and Henrik, respectively. Gradin notified them of the Canucks&#x27; intentions five minutes before the draft. Although then-Tampa Bay Lightning general manager Rick Dudley was ready to make Daniel his first overall choice before opening negotiations, he was convinced by Burke and Barnett that Daniel would not sign unless his brother was on the same team.

On 27 July 1999, a month following the draft, Henrik and Daniel signed three-year contracts with the Canucks. As the contract did not require them to begin playing in Vancouver immediately, they announced on 12 August they would return to Sweden to play one more season with Modo. During the 1999–2000 season, Henrik led Modo in scoring with 47 points in 50 games, two points ahead of Daniel. The two brothers played on a line with New York Islanders prospect Mattias Weinhandl.

=== Vancouver Canucks (2000–2018) ===

==== Early years (2000–2006) ====
The 2000–01 NHL season was Henrik&#x27;s first for the Canucks. His debut was the team&#x27;s first game of the campaign on 5 October 2000, a 6–3 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. With the game, Henrik and Daniel became the fourth pair of twins to have played in the NHL. Three days later, Henrik assisted on Daniel&#x27;s first career NHL goal in a 5–4 win against the Tampa Bay Lightning. The goal tied the game at 4 with 1:26 left in regulation. In a 5–2 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs on 16 October 2000, Henrik scored his first NHL goal and added an assist on Daniel&#x27;s second career goal. Henrik tallied 29 points over the course of the campaign—second among team rookies to Daniel&#x27;s 34 points. He and Daniel played primarily on the Canucks&#x27; third line.

Henrik improved to 36 points in his second NHL season; he finished with five goals in his last six games, taking his season total to 16. In the opening game of the 2002 Stanley Cup playoffs, Henrik scored the overtime winner against the first-seeded Detroit Red Wings to put the Canucks 1–0 ahead in the series; it was his first NHL playoff goal. Detroit went on to eliminate the Canucks in six games en route to winning the Stanley Cup. During the 2002–03 season, Henrik suffered a sprained left shoulder that forced him out of three games. He had sustained the injury during a game against the Edmonton Oilers on 14 December 2002. Henrik also missed a game on 23 February 2003 because of a hand injury. He played 78 games during 2002–03 and finished the campaign with 39 points.

After their third NHL season, Henrik and Daniel were re-signed to one-year, US$1.125 million contracts on 29 July 2003. The Sedins began the 2003–04 season on a line with first-year player Jason King. The trio were named the &quot;Mattress Line&quot; (two twins and a King) and formed the Canucks&#x27; second scoring unit until King was reassigned to the team&#x27;s minor league affiliate midway through the season. On 7 November 2003, St. Louis Blues forward Doug Weight was suspended four games without pay for a cross-check he delivered to Henrik during a game the previous day; Henrik was not injured. On 17 December 2003, Henrik was a healthy scratch for the first and only time in his NHL career. He was also sidelined for five games in March 2004 due to sore ribs. Over 76 games, Henrik increased his points total over the previous season to 42. During the off-season, Henrik and Daniel were re-signed to one-year, US$1.25 million contracts on 10 September 2004.

During the 2004–05 lockout, Henrik returned to Sweden to play for Modo with Daniel and their Canucks teammate Markus Näslund. During a game against Mora IK on 20 November 2004, Henrik received a slash that required a minor amputation to his left little finger. He finished the season with 36 points in 44 games, third in team scoring behind Peter Forsberg and Mattias Weinhandl.
As NHL play resumed in 2005–06, Henrik returned to the Canucks and scored 75 points, finishing second in team scoring behind Markus Näslund, who had 79 points. His breakout season was sparked, in part, by the signing of winger Anson Carter, who played on the Sedins&#x27; line and led the team in goal-scoring. The trio matched the scoring pace of the Canucks&#x27; top line of Näslund, Todd Bertuzzi and Brendan Morrison. Vancouver&#x27;s head coach at the time, Marc Crawford, recalled that season as marking the Sedins&#x27; ascent as leaders on the team, stating, &quot;By the end of that year, they definitely were our top guys. They had surpassed Näslund and Bertuzzi.&quot; During the off-season, Henrik and Daniel re-signed with the Canucks to identical three-year, $10.75 million contracts on 30 June 2006. Despite the team&#x27;s success with Carter, the Canucks did not re-sign him; he joined the Columbus Blue Jackets the following season.

==== Emergence, Hart Trophy season (2006–2010) ====
In the 2006–07 season, Henrik established himself as the Canucks&#x27; top-line centre. Winger Taylor Pyatt, who had been acquired in a trade from the Buffalo Sabres during the off-season, replaced Carter as the Sedins&#x27; linemate and went on to score a career-high 23 goals. For the fifth-straight season, Henrik recorded a personal best, with 81 points; he set a new Canucks record for assists in one season with 71, beating the 62 by André Boudrias in 1974–75. Henrik passed Boudrias on 25 March 2007, with a three-assist effort during a 5–4 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. In the opening game of the 2007 playoffs against the Dallas Stars, Henrik scored a game-winning, quadruple-overtime goal to end the seventh longest game in NHL history (and longest in Canucks history) at 138 minutes and six seconds of play. He struggled to produce offensively in his 12 games in the playoffs, however, managing four points as the Canucks were eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Anaheim Ducks in the second round.
Henrik was awarded his first NHL career penalty shot on 27 November 2007, during a game against the Anaheim Ducks. His attempt was stopped by goaltender Jonas Hiller. In 2007–08, Henrik was selected to play for the Western Conference in the 2008 All-Star Game against the East, the first appearance of his career. He recorded two assists. He won his first Cyrus H. McLean Trophy as Vancouver&#x27;s leading scorer with 76 points. His 61 assists ranked fourth in the League for the second consecutive season.

The following season, Henrik scored 22 goals and 82 points, tying for the team lead in points with Daniel. Steve Bernier had been acquired in the 2008 off-season in another trade with Buffalo and began the season on the top line with the Sedins. Bernier was later removed; on 12 February 2009, Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault moved Alexandre Burrows to the line during a game against the Phoenix Coyotes. After recording 19 points and three game-winning goals in March, Henrik was named the NHL&#x27;s Second Star of the Month. He added ten points over ten games in the 2009 playoffs, helping the Canucks advance to the second round, where they were defeated in six games by the Chicago Blackhawks.

Set to become unrestricted free agents on 1 July 2009, Henrik and Daniel began negotiating with the Canucks in the off-season and were reported to have asked for 12-year, $63 million contracts in mid-June. With free agency looming, Canucks general manager Mike Gillis travelled to Sweden to visit the Sedins, where they agreed on identical five-year, $30.5 million contracts on 1 July. On 30 September, Henrik was announced as one of the Canucks&#x27; three alternate captains, along with Ryan Kesler and Willie Mitchell.

Four games into the 2009–10 season, Daniel suffered the first major injury of his career, breaking his foot on 7 October 2009 in a game against the Montreal Canadiens. He was sidelined for 18 games, marking the first time in Henrik&#x27;s career that he played without his brother for an extended period. In Daniel&#x27;s absence, however, Henrik enjoyed a high-scoring start to the season. On 14 November, he scored his first NHL career hat-trick in an 8–2 win against the Colorado Avalanche. Leading up to Daniel&#x27;s 22 November return, Henrik scored seven goals in seven games. He continued his pace into December, recording a League-leading 25 points (five goals, 20 assists) in 15 games to be named the NHL&#x27;s First Star of the Month. The following month, he was named Second Star, having recorded 25 points in 13 games. On 7 January 2010, Henrik moved into top spot in the NHL scoring race, ahead of San Jose Sharks centre Joe Thornton with a three-assist night against the Phoenix Coyotes for all three assists on goals by Alexandre Burrows. It marked the first time in nearly five years, since Näslund was tied with Robert Lang on 18 February 2004, that a Canucks player held the League lead in scoring. During a 3–1 win against the Calgary Flames on 14 March, Henrik recorded his 416th career assist on a goal scored by Daniel to pass Trevor Linden as Vancouver&#x27;s all-time leader. On 27 March, he scored two assists on goals by Aleaxandre Burrows and Daniel against the San Jose Sharks to become the fourth Canuck in team history to record a 100-point season (after Pavel Bure, Alexander Mogilny and Markus Näslund). He was named Third Star of the Month for March after scoring 24 points in 15 games.
Henrik entered the final game of the regular season, on 10 April against the Calgary Flames, one point behind Washington Capitals forward and captain Alexander Ovechkin for the NHL scoring lead. In a pre-game ceremony, he was awarded the Canucks&#x27; Cyclone Taylor Trophy, Cyrus H. McLean Trophy and Molson Cup as the team&#x27;s most valuable player, leading scorer and three-star selection leader, respectively. He then went on to record four assists in a 7–3 win on three goals by Daniel and a goal by Kevin Bieksa to finish the season with 112 points, passing Ovechkin for the season lead, while also breaking Pavel Bure&#x27;s franchise record of 110 points, set in 1992–93. Ovechkin failed to register a point in his last game the next day against the Boston Bruins, earning Henrik the League scoring title and making him the first Art Ross Trophy winner in Canucks history. With a League-leading 83 assists, he also surpassed his own team record of 71 assists in one season. In the subsequent 2010 playoffs, Henrik added 14 points in 12 games. He scored the winning goal in game four against the Los Angeles Kings with under three minutes to go in regulation to tie the series at two games each. The Canucks went on to eliminate the Kings in six games before being ousted by the Chicago Blackhawks the following round for the second consecutive year.

On 19 May 2010, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Henrik their 2009–10 Player of the Year. He received 108 first-place votes out of the 353 NHL players, coaches and executives polled. Ovechkin received 86 first-place votes while Pittsburgh Penguins captain Sidney Crosby received 72 first-place votes. Henrik was also voted by his countrymen in the league to receive the Viking Award as the NHL&#x27;s best Swedish player. At the NHL Awards Show the following month on 23 June, Henrik, Ovechkin and Crosby were up for both the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player deemed by the media to be the most valuable to his team, and the Ted Lindsay Award, given to the best player as voted by the NHL Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA). After losing the Ted Lindsay Award to Ovechkin, Henrik was awarded the Hart, becoming the first Canuck and second Swedish player (after Peter Forsberg in 2003) to win the trophy. Henrik garnered 894 voting points, compared to Ovechkin&#x27;s 834 and Crosby&#x27;s 729. He admitted afterwards to feeling like the underdog going into the awards ceremony, noting &quot;[Ovechkin and Crosby] are the faces of the sport ... to be standing next to them as the old guy, it&#x27;s a strange feeling.&quot; He was additionally named to the NHL first All-Star team; at the same time, twin Daniel was named to the NHL second All-Star team. It marked the first time since Phil and Tony Esposito in 1973–74 that two brothers were named postseason NHL All-Stars. They were also chosen to appear together on the cover of EA Sports&#x27; European version of the &quot;NHL 11&quot; video game.

==== Stanley Cup Finals appearance and captaincy (2010–2018) ====
On 9 October 2010, Henrik was named the Canucks&#x27; 13th captain in team history during a pre-game ceremony celebrating the start of the team&#x27;s 40th season of play. He succeeded goaltender Roberto Luongo, who had stepped down as team captain the previous month after having served as the team captain the previous two seasons prior. Early in the 2010–11 season, he scored his first penalty shot goal on his second NHL career attempt on 1 November. Playing the New Jersey Devils, he scored on a backhand deke against goaltender Martin Brodeur. Midway through the campaign, he was chosen to his second career NHL All-Star Game. Playing on Team Lidstrom opposite Daniel and teammate Ryan Kesler on Team Staal, Henrik helped his squad to an 11–10 win, recording two assists in the process. Finishing the season with 19 goals and a League-leading 75 assists over all 82 games, he ranked fourth in the NHL point-scoring with 94; only brother Daniel, Martin St. Louis of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Corey Perry of the Anaheim Ducks finished ahead of him. With Daniel winning the League scoring title, the two became the first brothers to win the Art Ross Trophy in consecutive years. (Chicago Blackhawks forwards Doug and Max Bentley also won separate scoring titles, but had achieved the feat three years apart in 1943 and 1946, respectively.)
As the Canucks established a team-record 54 wins and 117 points, they won their first Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the team with the best regular season record. Entering the 2011 playoffs as the Presidents&#x27; Trophy, the Canucks eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion and eighth seeded Chicago Blackhawks and the fifth seeded Nashville Predators in seven and six games, respectively. In the third round against the second seeded San Jose Sharks, Henrik established a single-game Canucks playoff record with four assists in Game 4 on two goals by Sami Salo along with goals by Alexandre Burrows and Ryan Kesler, leading the Canucks to a 4–2 win. His first three assists helped the Canucks set another team record for the fastest three goals scored in a playoff game; all three were registered on 5-on-3 powerplays in a span of one minute and fifty-five seconds. With his third assist of the game, Henrik set another team record with his 16th assist of the 2011 playoffs, surpassing Pavel Bure&#x27;s mark set in 1994. With San Jose facing elimination the following game, Henrik recorded two more assists on goals by Burrows and Kesler for his 11th and 12th points in the series, tying Bure for most in a single round by a Canucks player. Vancouver won the game 3–2 in double-overtime on a Kevin Bieksa game winner to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. Playing the third seeded Boston Bruins, the Canucks won the first two games of the series, but went on to lose four-games-to-three. Henrik finished the postseason with three goals and 22 points (three goals, 19 assists) over all 25 games, ranking second in playoff scoring behind Bruins centre David Krejčí. It was revealed following their defeat that Henrik had been playing a large portion of the playoffs with a back injury.

A week after Vancouver&#x27;s Game 7 loss, Henrik was on hand at the NHL Awards Ceremony in Las Vegas, having been nominated along with Daniel for the NHL Foundation Player Award for their charitable work. They lost the award to Los Angeles Kings captain Dustin Brown. For his regular season efforts, Henrik was named to the NHL first All-Star team for a second consecutive year, alongside Daniel, who earned the distinction for the first time. Returning to Sweden in the off-season, Henrik and Daniel were co-recipients of the Victoria Scholarship as the country&#x27;s athletes of the year. They became the third and fourth ice hockey players to receive the award, after Stefan Persson in 1980 and Peter Forsberg in 1994. Henrik and Daniel were presented the award, commemorated with glass plates, on 14 July 2011, in the city of Borgholm.

Playing in the 2011–12 season opener, Henrik dressed for his 500th consecutive NHL regular season game, having not missed a contest since returning from a rib injury on 21 March 2004. Almost three months later, he surpassed Brendan Morrison&#x27;s Canucks record of 534 consecutive games played in a 5–2 win against the Edmonton Oilers on 26 December 2011. The previous game, in which he tied the record, was played against Morrison&#x27;s Calgary Flames. At the end of the month, Henrik was named the NHL&#x27;s Third Star for December, having recorded 22 points (two goals and 20 assists) over 15 games (a League-high total for the month). At the mid-season mark, Henrik was named to his third NHL All-Star Game in January 2012. He was one of four players representing the Canucks, including Daniel, Alexander Edler and Cody Hodgson, who was named as a rookie. With the exception of Hodgson, all the Canucks All-Stars were selected to Team Alfredsson. Henrik went on to record a goal and two assists in a 12–9 loss to Team Chara. Shortly after the All-Star break, Henrik injured his foot while blocking a shot from Nashville Predators defenceman Kevin Klein on 7 February. He briefly left the game and while a subsequent CT scan revealed no fracture, he remained questionable for the following contest before eventually playing through the ailment. Later that month, Henrik began a streak that saw him go eight games without a point for the first time since the 2003–04 season. Near the end of the regular season on 21 March, Daniel sustained a concussion during a game against the Chicago Blackhawks, forcing Henrik to play without his brother for the final nine contests of the campaign. During that span, he recorded 11 points, leading the Canucks to eight wins and one loss. The season-ending streak helped the Canucks to their second consecutive Presidents&#x27; Trophy, clinching the championship on the last game of the campaign on 7 April, a 3–0 win against the Edmonton Oilers. During the contest, Henrik broke a 22-game goalless streak with the game-winner. With 67 assists, he led the League for a third consecutive season, becoming the fifth player in NHL history to do so, after Joe Thornton (2005–08), Wayne Gretzky (1979–92), Bobby Orr (1969–72) and Stan Mikita (1964–67). Though his points total dropped to 81, which ranked ninth in the NHL, he led the Canucks in scoring and was voted the team MVP. The Canucks entered the 2012 playoffs against the eighth-seeded and eventual Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings. With Daniel out with a late season concussion, Vancouver lost the first two games. In Game 3, Henrik received a hard hit from Kings&#x27; forward and captain Dustin Brown—he had to be helped onto the bench following the hit and went to the locker room for six minutes. Despite later returning to the game, the Canucks lost 1–0. With Daniel back in the lineup for Game 4, Henrik registered a goal on Kings&#x27; goaltender Jonathan Quick and an assist on a Kevin Bieksa goal in a 3–1 Canucks&#x27; victory. Still facing elimination in Game 5, Henrik scored a power play goal on Quick late in the first period to give Vancouver the early lead, though Canucks were unable to add another goal and eventually lost the game 2–1 in overtime with the winning goal scored by Kings forward Jarret Stoll for a 4–1 defeat in the series. Henrik finished the playoffs with two goals and five points to lead the team in scoring.

Despite another lockout beginning on 15 September 2012, the Sedins decided that they would only return to Modo, now managed by former teammate Markus Näslund, if the entire 2012–13 season wound up cancelled. Instead, the shortened season began in January 2013 with a 48-game schedule over the normal 82 game schedule, and shortly into the season on 15 February 2013, Henrik passed Näslund as the franchise&#x27;s all-time leading scorer with 757 points against the Dallas Stars. After scoring the record-setting point against the Stars, Sedin was given a standing ovation that carried on as play continued. After three minutes, the play stopped and Sedin saluted the crowd. During a commercial break, the Canucks ran a tribute video for the accomplishment, featuring congratulations from Näslund and Trevor Linden, the third-leading scorer in team history. In the final game of the season against the Edmonton Oilers on 27 April, Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault wanted to rest his regulars ahead of the playoffs. However, he played Henrik in the game though only for 22 seconds; he left the bench after just one shift. For his part, Henrik told Vigneault before the game that &quot;he would be okay with sitting out the game&quot; and to him the streak is just &quot;a number in the paper.&quot; Vigneault responded by telling Sedin that &quot;he&#x27;s not going to be the one that breaks the streak&quot;, and he gave him the choice to remain on the bench or return to the locker room. Sedin felt remaining on the bench would have been a further distraction and chose to leave. Henrik finished the season with 11 goals and 34 assists for 45 points in all 48 games.
As of the end of the 2012–13 season, six 2003–04 season regular season games plus four regular season games in the previous season are the only NHL games he had missed in the regular season or play-offs throughout his NHL career of 1,039 games, to that point.Through the end of the 2012–13 season Henrik trailed only St. Louis Blues defenceman Jay Bouwmeester among active NHL ironman streaks; Bouwmeester had played in six more consecutive regular season games than Henrik&#x27;s 629. On 21 January 2014, Sedin&#x27;s consecutive regular season games streak ended at 679 games due to a rib injury sustained 16 January when he was cross-checked in Phoenix by Coyotes forward Martin Hanzal.

On 1 November 2013, the Sedins signed matching $28 million contract extensions to play four more years with the Canucks. Sedin played his 1,000th NHL game against the Winnipeg Jets on 12 March 2014, becoming only the second player in franchise history to reach that milestone. His brother Daniel reached the same milestone early in the 2014–15 season. Sedin appeared in 70 games for the Canucks during the 2013–14 season and scored 50 points: 11 goals and 39 assists. Having been eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the 2013 playoffs, the 2013–14 Canucks failed to qualify for the postseason for the first time since 2008.

On 3 March 2015, against the San Jose Sharks, Sedin scored his 900th point, a goal on Sharks goaltender Antti Niemi in the second period of the game. He was the 101st player to reach this milestone. Sedin became the first player in Canucks history to record 900 points with the team. On 6 April, Sedin scored his 700th career assist against the Los Angeles Kings. During the 2014–15 season, Sedin had 18 goals and 55 assists, and his total of 73 points was his highest since 2011–12.
Sedin was awarded the King Clancy Memorial Trophy at the conclusion of the 2015–16 season. Henrik surpassed Trevor Linden for most regular season games played in a Canucks uniform on 13 February 2016 during a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. Sedin had 11 goals and 44 assists for 55 points in 74 contests in 2015–16.

On 20 January 2017, Sedin reached the 1,000 point milestone with a goal against the Florida Panthers and former teammate Roberto Luongo. Sedin had 15 goals and 35 assists for 50 points in all 82 games during the 2016–17 season. A pregame ceremony in his honour was held on 4 February.

On 2 April 2018, Daniel and Henrik announced that they would be retiring at the end of the season in a letter thanking the Canucks organization and their fans. On 5 April, the Sedin Twins played their final game in Rogers Arena against the Arizona Coyotes. In their last home game, Henrik recorded two assists on his brother&#x27;s goals to help defeat the Coyotes 4–3. Henrik played his final game on 7 April, in a 3–2 shootout loss to the Edmonton Oilers; he retired alongside Daniel at the end of the 2017–18 season after 17 seasons and 1,330 regular season games with the Vancouver Canucks. Despite their retirement, Henrik and his brother were nominated, and named finalists, for the King Clancy Memorial Trophy, which they won on 20 June.

== Post playing career ==
On 12 February 2020, Henrik&#x27;s number 33 would be raised to the rafters alongside his brother Daniel&#x27;s number 22 in an hour-long jersey retirement ceremony, the culmination of a week-long celebration of the twins&#x27; career.

On 22 June 2021, it was announced that Henrik and Daniel would join the Canucks Hockey Operations department and were named special advisors to the general manager.

On 30 May 2022, the Canucks announced that the Sedins had transitioned into new roles with player development, working daily on and off the ice with young players in Vancouver and Abbotsford.

On 28 June 2022, it was announced that Henrik would join his brother Daniel in being inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame later that year, together becoming the first career Canucks to make it to the hall. 

== International play ==




Henrik played for the first time in North America with Sweden&#x27;s national under-17 team at the 1997 World U17 Hockey Challenge, held in Alberta. Recording 20 points (12 goals and eight assists) over six games, he helped Sweden to a silver medal. After going undefeated in five contests, they were defeated in the gold medal game by Team Ontario, 6–2.

Henrik competed for Sweden at the 1997 European Junior Championships, recording three goals and seven points over six games. He joined Sweden for the 1998 European Junior Championships, the final game of which required Sweden to beat Russia by four goals to surpass Finland in goal differential and win the gold medal. Henrik recorded a goal and an assist against Russia as Sweden won 5–1.

In his NHL draft year, Henrik competed for Sweden at the 1999 World Junior Championships in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He recorded nine points in six games, fifth in tournament scoring and second in team scoring to brother Daniel, as Sweden failed to win a medal. Later that year, Henrik made his international debut for the Swedish men&#x27;s team at the 1999 World Championships in Norway. He scored no points in eight games as Sweden won the bronze medal.

In 2000, Henrik once again competed in both the World Junior and Senior Championships. At the junior tournament in Sweden, Henrik led the tournament with 13 points in seven games, but Sweden did not earn a medal. At the World Championships, Henrik recorded five points as Sweden again failed to medal.

Following his rookie season with the Vancouver Canucks, Henrik made his third World Championships appearance, in 2001 in Germany. He earned his second bronze medal in three years as Sweden defeated the United States 3–2 in the bronze medal game. He made a fourth tournament appearance at the 2005 World Championships in Austria. Sweden missed out on the bronze medal, losing to Russia 6–3. Henrik had a goal and an assist in a losing effort during the bronze medal game. He finished the tournament with two goals and six points in nine games.
On 22 December 2005, Henrik was named to the Swedish Olympic team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He joined Daniel, Markus Näslund and Mattias Öhlund as one of four Canucks on the squad. Competing in his first Olympics, he contributed four points as Sweden won a gold medal, defeating Finland 3–2 in the final. Four years later, Henrik was once again named to the Swedish Olympic team for the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Unlike the previous Olympics, Henrik went into the 2010 tournament as one of Sweden&#x27;s key players: at the time of the roster announcement on 27 December 2009, he led all Swedish players in NHL scoring. Sweden failed to defend their gold medal from Turin, however, losing to Slovakia in the tournament quarterfinal. Henrik had two assists in four games.

Still recovering from the rib injury he suffered during the 2013–14 NHL season, Sedin was unable to play at the 2014 Olympics. In 2016, Henrik was named Captain of Sweden at the World Cup of Hockey after captain Henrik Zetterberg was injured in a practice game. Sweden reached the semifinals before losing to a side with representatives from eight European nations.

== Playing style ==
Throughout his career, Henrik recorded markedly more assists than goals. Known as a , he started play sequences that led to goals with passes to his teammates. Many of the plays he generated were created off the cycle. Henrik&#x27;s familiarity with Daniel&#x27;s play enhanced his effectiveness; the pair were known for their ability to find each other intuitively with passes, often without looking.

Beginning around the 2008–09 season, Henrik began to expand his skill-set by scoring more goals. His increased tendency to shoot was given an extra push when Daniel suffered the first major injury of his career early in the 2009–10 season, forcing Henrik to play without his brother for several weeks and consequently pass less often. He recorded the first two 20-goal seasons of his career in both 2008–09 and 2009–10, and increased his shot totals.

With his offensive skill the prime component of his game, Henrik was known to avoid initiating contact with opposing players. Early in their careers, he and Daniel were knocked off the puck easily. As a result, players often took advantage of the brothers&#x27; lack of physicality by playing aggressively against them. Canucks then-general manager Brian Burke publicly complained, commenting during a 2002 playoff series against the Detroit Red Wings, Sedin&#x27; is not Swedish for &#x27;punch me or headlock me in a scrum&#x27;.&quot; As their careers progressed, the Sedins worked on their strength, improving their puck possession and allowing them to play more effectively.

== Personal life ==
Henrik is married to Johanna Sedin; they have two sons: Valter, who was born in 2007 in Vancouver and Harry, who was born on 12 May 2010. They live together in the city&#x27;s Yaletown neighbourhood, and return to Sweden during the off-season. In March 2010, Henrik and Johanna made a joint $1.5 million donation, with Daniel and his wife Marinette, to the BC Children&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;s $200 million project for a new building; the two families requested that it be put towards a pediatric intensive-care unit and a diagnostic imaging area. Henrik commented that it was something he and his wife had wanted to do since Valter was born.

Sedin&#x27;s eldest son Valter plays for Whitecaps FC 2, the reserve team of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC of Major League Soccer.

Henrik and Daniel Sedin are devoted harness racing fans and race horse owners. Their most successful trotter so far is the 2013 Elitloppet winner Nahar.

<text>The Gospel of John is a 2003 epic biblical drama film that recounts the life of Jesus according to the Gospel of John. The film is a word-for-word adaptation of the American Bible Society&#x27;s Good News Bible and follows the Gospel of John precisely, without additions to the story from the other Gospels or omissions of the Gospel&#x27;s complex passages. It stars Henry Ian Cusick as Jesus of Nazareth, Stuart Bunce as John and is narrated by Christopher Plummer.

==Cast==
==Production==
This film was created by a constituency of artists from Canada and the United Kingdom, along with academic and theological consultants from around the world. The cast was selected primarily from the Stratford Shakespeare Festival and Soulpepper Theatre Company, as well as Britain&#x27;s Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal National Theatre. The musical score, composed by Jeff Danna and created for the film, is partially based on the music of the Biblical period. The film was produced by Visual Bible International. Filming took place in Toronto, Ontario, and Almeria and Andalucia, Spain.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
 The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Gospel of John&quot; takes a reverent approach to its story without ever bringing it to life, proving that cribbing from the Good Book isn&#x27;t enough to guarantee a good movie.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 52 out of 100 based on responses from 14 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

===Criticism===
While the film is largely a faithful depiction of the Gospel of John, Rhonda Handlon of &quot;Plugged In&quot; noted that the inclusion of Mary Magdalene at the Last Supper has no direct Biblical citation, and might cause issue with viewers who prefer only direct scriptural references.

<text>William John Bowser (Rexton, New Brunswick December 3, 1867 – October 25, 1933 Vancouver) was a politician in British Columbia, Canada. He served as the 17th premier of British Columbia from 1915 to 1916.

The son of William Bowser and Margaret Gordon, Bowser was educated at Mount Allison University and Dalhousie University. He moved to Vancouver to practice law in 1891, and after being an unsuccessful candidate in the 1898 provincial election, was first elected to the provincial legislature in the 1903 election as a Conservative. Bowser served as Attorney General in the cabinet of Sir Richard McBride from 1907 until 1915. As Attorney General, Bowser forced the Squamish First Nation, then the False Creek Indian Band, off Kitsilano Indian Reserve no.6. He also served as Minister of Finance and Agriculture between October 1909 and October 1910, and then again between March and December 1915.

In 1915, he succeeded McBride as Premier. He also served as Attorney-General in his own administration.

The Conservative party was deeply divided and unpopular and the change in leadership did not improve matters. Accusations of corruption and &quot;machine politics&quot; were rife. The Conservatives also neglected to address popular demands for women&#x27;s suffrage and prohibition. Bowser&#x27;s government was defeated in the 1916 election, losing to Liberal leader Harlan Carey Brewster, who two years later was succeeded by the more memorable John Oliver. Bowser continued as leader of the opposition until he lost his seat in the 1924 election.

He returned to politics in the 1933 election to lead the Non-Partisan Independent Group of candidates, but died during the election campaign.

A river, a lake and the small community of Bowser on Vancouver Island, between Parksville and the Comox Valley, are named for Bowser.
