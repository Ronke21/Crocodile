<text>Rage (written as Getting It On) is a psychological thriller novel by American writer Stephen King, the first he published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. It was published in 1977 and was collected in the 1985 hardcover omnibus &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;. The novel describes a school shooting, and has been associated with actual high school shooting incidents in the 1980s and 1990s. In response, King allowed the novel to fall out of print. In 2013, King published the anti-firearms violence essay &quot;Guns&quot;.

==Summary==
In May 1976, Charlie Decker, a high school senior in Placerville, Maine, is called to a meeting with his principal about the cause of his suspension - an incident in which he struck his chemistry teacher with a pipe wrench, leading to the teacher&#x27;s hospitalization. After repeatedly insulting the principal, he is expelled. 

Storming out of the office, Charlie retrieves a pistol from his locker and sets its other contents on fire. Returning to his classroom, he fatally shoots his algebra teacher. The fire triggers an alarm, but Charlie forces his classmates to stay in the room, killing a history teacher when he attempts to enter. As the school evacuates, the police and media arrive.

Over the following four hours, Charlie toys with the authority figures&#x27; attempt at negotiation, including the principal, the school psychologist, and the local police chief. Charlie gives them certain commands, threatening to kill students if they do not comply. Charlie admits to his hostages that he does not know what has compelled him to commit his deeds, believing he will regret them when the standoff is over. As his fellow students start identifying with Charlie, he unwittingly turns the class into an impromptu psychotherapy group, causing the participants to semi-voluntarily tell embarrassing secrets regarding themselves and each other.

Interspersed throughout are flashbacks to Charlie&#x27;s troubled childhood, particularly his tumultuous relationship with his abusive father Carl. As the standoff proceeds, a police sniper attempts to shoot Charlie through the heart. He survives due to having placed the combination lock from his locker in the breast pocket of his shirt.

Charlie finally realizes that only one student is really being held against his will: &quot;Big Man On Campus&quot; Ted Jones, who is harboring his own secrets. Ted also realizes this and attempts to escape the classroom, but the other students brutally assault him. Charlie eventually releases the students except for Ted, who is in a catatonic state. When the police chief enters the classroom, the now-unarmed Charlie feigns reaching for his pistol, leading the chief to shoot him. Charlie survives the shooting and, in August 1976, is declared insane and committed to a psychiatric hospital in Augusta, Maine.

The final chapters contain an inter-office memo concerning Ted&#x27;s treatment and prognosis at the hospital where he is now a patient, and a letter from one of Charlie&#x27;s friends describing developments in the students&#x27; lives during the months following this incident. The story ends with Charlie addressing the reader: &quot;That&#x27;s the end. I have to turn off the light now. Good night.&quot;

==Connections to actual school shootings==
The plot of &quot;Rage&quot; vaguely resembles actual high school shootings and incidents of hostage-taking that have transpired since its publication. As a result, King became uncomfortable with the idea of having it remain in print, for fear that it might inspire further such occurrences. The novel has been associated with several events:

*Jeffrey Lyne Cox, a senior at San Gabriel High School in San Gabriel, California, took a semi-automatic rifle to school on April 26, 1988, and held a humanities class of about 60 students hostage for over 30 minutes. Cox held the gun to one student when the teacher doubted Cox would cause harm and stated that he would prove it to her. At that time three students escaped out a rear door and were fired upon. Cox was later tackled and disarmed by another student. A friend of Cox told the press that Cox had been inspired by the Kuwait Airways Flight 422 hijacking and by the novel &quot;Rage&quot;, which Cox had read over and over again and with which he strongly identified.
*Dustin L. Pierce, a senior at Jackson County High School in McKee, Kentucky, armed himself with a shotgun and two handguns and took a history classroom hostage in a nine-hour standoff with police on September 18, 1989, that ended without injury. Police found a copy of &quot;Rage&quot; among the possessions in Pierce&#x27;s bedroom, leading to speculation that he had been inspired by the novel.
*On September 11, 1991, Ryan R. Harris walked into a math class at Stevens High School in Rapid City, South Dakota, pulled out a sawed-off shotgun, and ordered the teacher to leave. The teacher complied and Harris held the rest of the class hostage for the next four hours. Harris had been inspired by Stephen King&#x27;s novella &quot;Rage&quot;. Harris demanded pizza and cigarettes, which were delivered, and $1 million and a helicopter, which were not. He fired a total of 10 shots in the room, at objects such as the overhead projector and intercom. No students or faculty were injured or killed. Upon receiving the cigarettes he had demanded, Harris set down his shotgun to pull out a lighter and light his cigarette. In this moment 17-year-old senior Chris Ericks picked up the shotgun and police swarmed in bringing the stand off to an end.
*On January 18, 1993, Scott Pennington, a student at East Carter High School in Grayson, Kentucky, took a .38-caliber revolver that was owned by his father and fatally shot his English teacher Deanna McDavid in the head, during her seventh-period class. He subsequently shot and killed the school&#x27;s custodian Marvin Hicks and held the class hostage for 20 minutes before releasing them. Just before the shooting, he had written an essay on &quot;Rage&quot; and was upset that McDavid had given it a C grade.
*In December 1997, Michael Carneal shot eight fellow students, three of them fatally, at a prayer meeting at Heath High School in West Paducah, Kentucky. He had a copy of &quot;Rage&quot; in his locker as part of the Richard Bachman omnibus. This was the incident that moved King to allow the book to go out of print.
*One school shooting was compared to &quot;Rage&quot; due to inaccurate reporting. Barry Loukaitis, a student at Frontier Middle School in Moses Lake, Washington, walked from his house to the school on February 2, 1996, and entered his algebra classroom during fifth period. He opened fire on students, killing two and wounding another. He then fatally shot his algebra teacher Leona Caires in the chest. As his classmates&#x27; shock turned to panic, Loukaitis reportedly said, &quot;This sure beats algebra, doesn&#x27;t it?&quot;—a line erroneously reported to be from &quot;Rage&quot;. (No such line appears in King&#x27;s story. The closest is when Charlie Decker quips, &quot;This sure beats panty raids.&quot;) However, subsequently, Stephen King in his essay &quot;Guns&quot; wrote that it &quot;was&quot; a quote from the novel. Upon hearing the gunshots, gym coach Jon Lane entered the classroom. Loukaitis was holding his classmates hostage and planned to keep one hostage to safely exit the school. Lane volunteered to be the hostage, and Loukaitis kept Lane at gunpoint with his rifle. Lane grabbed the weapon from Loukaitis, wrestled him to the ground, and then assisted the evacuation of students.

==End of publication==
When King decided to let &quot;Rage&quot; fall out of print in the United States, it remained available only as part of &quot;The Bachman Books&quot;. In contrast, the other novels that appeared in that compilation—&quot;The Long Walk&quot;, &quot;Roadwork&quot;, and &quot;The Running Man&quot;—are available separately in the US. &quot;Rage&quot; remained available in the United Kingdom and other countries in &quot;The Bachman Books&quot; for a time, but later appeared to become unavailable. New editions of &quot;The Bachman Books&quot; do not include &quot;Rage&quot;. In a footnote to the preface of the novel &quot;Blaze&quot;, dated January 30, 2007, King wrote of &quot;Rage&quot;: &quot;Now out of print, and a good thing.&quot;

King said, in his keynote address at the VEMA Annual Meeting on May 26, 1999: &quot;The Carneal incident was enough for me. I asked my publisher to take the damned thing out of print. They concurred.&quot; King went on to describe his view on this subject, which acknowledged the role that cultural or artistic products such as &quot;Rage&quot; play in influencing individuals, particularly troubled youths, while also declaring that artists and writers should not be denied the aesthetic opportunity to draw upon their own culture—which is suffused with violence, according to King—in their work. King went on to describe his inspiration for stories such as &quot;Rage&quot;, which drew heavily upon his own frustrations and pains as a high school student.

In an article on the ominous writings of Virginia Tech shooter Seung-Hui Cho for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, King said: &quot;Certainly in this sensitized day and age, my own college writing—including a short story called &#x27;Cain Rose Up&#x27; and the novel &quot;Rage&quot;—would have raised red flags, and I&#x27;m certain someone would have tabbed me as mentally ill because of them...&quot; After the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, he elaborated in a non-fiction essay, titled &quot;Guns&quot; (2013), on why he let &quot;Rage&quot; go out of print. King&#x27;s website states: &quot;All profits from &#x27;Guns&#x27; will benefit the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.&quot;

<text>Caspar Peucer ( , ; January 6, 1525 – September 25, 1602) was a German reformer, physician, and scholar of Sorbian origin.

==Personal life ==

=== Early life ===
Caspar Peucer was born on January 6, 1525, in Bautzen, (Sachsen, Germany) and died on September 25, 1602, in Dessau, (Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany). He was the child of Gregor Peucer, a known craftsman, and Ottilie Simon. Peucer&#x27;s father, Gregor, was trusted with certain tasks from the Bautzen elite regarding the city quarters between the town council and burghers. The Bautzen elite was an interconnected family with relational ties, this indicates that Peucer himself was also related to Gregorius Mattig, who was a highly respected humanist and intellectual during this time. Mattig himself, was a director of Upper Lusatia representing the Estate town during their uprising in the early 15th century. Peucer&#x27;s education began in his hometown of Sachsen where he began studying at a local Protestant grammar school. This education system was excelling under the Joachim Knemiander administration, originating from the Upper Lusatian town which, is now present day Poland.

=== Middle life ===
After some time Peucer was later sent to a Latin school (named &#x27;Trotzendorf&#x27;) of Valentin Friedland. It was here he learned more regarding the new and developing Lutheran education, here he met other students who were interested in the same ideologies. Not too long after Peucer was at Trotzendorf, he was recommended to attend the University of Saxon Wittenberg. Wittenberg was a university where many Lutherans enrolled, this was also the place that the main disputes of the Reformation occurred. Then, Peucer enrolled in the University of Wittenberg in March 1543, after he finished his undergraduate he went on to graduate with his masters in September 1545. After graduation Peucer quickly became a professor at the University of Wittenberg, replacing Erasmus Reinhold following his death in 1553. Peucer began as a lower math professor in 1550 then, worked his way up to higher mathematics in 1554. While working as a professor at Wittenberg, Peucer taught alongside notable other mathematicians of the time and graduates of Wittenberg such as Erasmus Reinhold and Michael Maestlin. In his time at Wittenberg, Peucer was also one of the main promoters, along with Philipp Melanchthon, of the astrological department/program. After, he accepted the name of the rector of the Leucorea. In this time he continued going to school to ultimately gain his title as a doctor of medicine in 1560. It was during this time that Peucer began thinking more critically about his astrology views. He believed astrology was not only a practical art but an essential part of natural philosophy. The idea is that astrology fits perfectly into the teleological worldview in which it shows the critical work of God&#x27;s creation, the stars being a secondary asset. After his research and schooling he later graduated with his master&#x27;s degree. Peucer went on to marry his first wife, Magdalena, daughter of theologian and humanist Philipp Melanchthon. During their marriage she gave birth to three sons and seven daughters, she later died in 1575.

=== Later life ===
Around 1570, Peucer became the doctor to the Elector of Saxony, Augusts, who was a significant figure during the time of the Schmalkaldic war. In the position he became one of August&#x27;s trusted advisors and acted as the head of the Philipistic. The main goal was to gain followers of the Lutheran church, this quickly created some suspicion that there was a connection with Peucer and Calvinism. Created by John Calvin, a Protestant reformer, Calvinism was an immediately popular religion that quickly spread throughout Europe. It came at the perfect time when religion began expanding, and freedom of searching religion was brought forth. Calvinism was thought to be against the views of astrology; as Peucer was thinking more critically about astrology fitting into a teleological world, this was a stepping stone indicating his views were differing from society. Peucer was soon accused of a Calvinism plot and was captured on April 1, 1574, in Wittenberg; it was there that Peucer&#x27;s works were searched, and he had to explain his religious and political ties in front of the Dresden Consistory. His accusation stems from his interpretation of the Lord&#x27;s Supper because strict Lutherans believe that Christ was in the Eucharist.  It was the Consistory that charged Peucer with Calvinism and suspected he tried to expand his teaching to Saxony. He pleaded not guilty but, after countless trials, he was found guilty from his own personal writings. This was the start of Peucer&#x27;s twelve years in prison, it began in the Rochlitz castle, where Magdalena could stay with him. But, later he was moved to Leipzig, where he stayed for the rest of his sentence. At this point, he was unable to teach math, astronomy, or medicine. So, Peucer turned towards writing poetry. It was here that wrote his poem, Idyllium, and his longest poem reflecting on his birthplace in Upper Lusatia. During this time he was waiting for his family to bring forth a petition to get him out of his sentence early, which was granted in 1586. After his release he became the personal doctor to Anhalt princess in Desseau, he died in the capitol on September 25, 1602.

While not as well known as Tycho Brahe, Peucer worked with Brahe in a few instances, including intervening by letter on Brahe&#x27;s behalf in a dispute between the latter and Christoph Rothman surrounding his invention of the Tychonic system.

== Official titles/professions ==

* Professor at the University of Wittenberg (1550–1559)
* Rector of the University of Wittenberg
*Philosopher
* Medical doctor (achieved in 1560)
* Physician to August of Saxony (1570)
* Astronomer
* Astrological correspondent

== Religious ideology ==
Caspar Peucer was a practicing Protestant who believed in Divine Providence, this just meant that God is able to and does intervene with nature. The Protestant astrologers of the time held the belief that before the original sin, nature did not deviate from its expected laws. But then after the Fall, God and the devil began to send supernatural messages through nature.  This could be seen through medical diagnoses, astrological horoscopes, and meteorology, according to Peucer. As a Christian, Peucer believed in divine intervention, be it by God or the Devil. The ideas of what was considered official divination seemed to differ in opinion from person to person. Peucer upheld that God was the only divine entity with the capability of changing the course or essence of nature. Caspar Peucer extensively recorded how the constellations and meteorological events were signs or warnings of historical events that occurred near the time of the astronomical events.

Divine providence in astrology was in opposition to what many of the Catholics and Orthodox Lutherans believed. They would say that pairing natural signs with historical events or future events does not work with the belief that God gave humankind freewill. The accepted view for science and philosophy was to follow an Aristotilian approach, which includes using empirical evidence and reason to come to conclusions. That is definitely the standard goal for philosophers when coming up with any theories or ideas. Peucer tried to link his ideas of astrology with a strong Aristotelian argument through one of his writings, but it does not seem like he ever really convinced the Catholics of his ideas, and others abandoned the ideas of horoscopes as a science fairly quickly after the height of its popularity. Additionally, Peucer believed in both angles and demons which can be found in some of his astrological ideology. Specifically, Peucer thought that both of these entities could affect and even explain some serious astrological phenomena such as comets in the atmosphere to produce many particular effects that he had no other explanation for. That being said, in his texts, Peucer believed that these event could somewhat predict the future as they were signs that appeared not only to our world, but also the sublunar world. He justified this on the basis that, there would be no point in astrological signs appearing from unknown sources if they did not mean anything.

Peucer&#x27;s thinking about meteorology was that it had two purposes: a natural one and a divine one. He believed that the energy from the weather caused an effect on human behavior, which he called the &quot;natural efficient cause&quot;. He believed that the divine cause, which he called the &quot;final cause&quot; gave warnings or signs. This can be seen in his belief of angels and demons as Peucer thought that these entities, for reasons both good and bad, could be the source of some phenomena such earthquakes. From this, they were able to draw a lot of knowledge about God that corresponds to Protestantism. Ideas such as how God is transcendent and cares enough to intervene in nature. The religious perspective through which meteorology and astrology was looked at was important in gaining acceptance and support for the ideas. There were different levels that meteors were classified by. Because of Peucer&#x27;s belief that only God can actually go against nature, lesser powers, like the devil, were able to cause rare meteorological events. But, Peucer also recognized that it can be rather unclear to recognize in nature who is causing rare meteorological events as it could be God, the devil, angels, demons, or even just natural causes. It could These rare events were not technically against nature; they held more meaning than everyday normal weather, but were not placed on the same level as miracles.

During this time, science and religion were used in ways that supported each other. Peucer&#x27;s Christianity pressured him to teach a geocentric model of the universe, which led him to the common and comfortable theory of Ptolemy. In 1543, Copernicus released his model of the universe which was heliocentric, the sun was in the center, but Peucer did not attach to Copernicus&#x27; model because the Christians at the time believed the Earth had to be the center of the cosmos.

=== Religious conflict ===
There is evidence that there were strict rules regarding the Lord&#x27;s Supper, any mishandling or deviations from the traditions of taking it were seen as something that could be punishable by law. Peucer&#x27;s denial of Christ&#x27;s physical presence in the bread got him in trouble. Because Peucer held such a high power position in education, he was also able to hire chairmen that were not Orthodox Lutherans, they were known as Philippists (followers of Philip Melanchthon).

For about a decade of his life, Peucer was imprisoned and expelled from the University of Wittenberg along with several other teachers who were also expelled (1576-1586). This was mainly on account of secretly being a Calvinist along with a few other theological differences with the elector, August of Saxony. August of Saxony ultimately had the largest hand in Peucer&#x27;s imprisonment due to his intolerance of Calvinism, which was a Protestant Christian reform led by John Calvin in the 1500s that differed from Catholicism and Lutheranism which were the two dominant religions in Germany at the time. Peucer was finally released from his imprisonment in 1587 after August of Saxony died. That being said, philosophical teachings during the period of Peucer&#x27;s imprisonment were affected and progress was greatly slowed. The imprisonment resulted in damaged reputation, loss of credibility, and the loss of most of their power at Wittenburg for Peucer and his colleagues.

==Works (incomplete)==
He wrote on mathematics, astronomy, geometry, and medicine, and edited some of Melanchthon&#x27;s letters (1565 and 1570):
*&quot;De dimensione terrae&quot; (1550)
*&quot;Elementa doctrinae de circulis coelestibus et primo motu&quot; (1551)
*&quot;Tractatus historicus de Ph. Melanchthonis sententia de controversia coenae Domini&quot;, 1553 (printed 1596)
*&quot;Commentarius de praecipuis divinationum generibus&quot;, 1553 - this writing was Peucer&#x27;s attempt to prove astrology was a science
*&quot;Logistice regulae arithmeticae, quam Cossam et Algebram vocant&quot; (1556)
*&quot;Corpus Doctrinae Philippicum&quot;, 1560
*&quot;Chronicon Carionis&quot; (1560-1565)
*&quot;Opera Melan&quot;, 1562–65
*&quot;Epistolae&quot;, 1565
*&quot;De Essentia et ortu animae 1590&quot; - about the connection of the constellations to the immaterial soul and the mortal soul
*&quot;Idyllion de Lusatia&quot;, 1583 (printed 1594)

== &quot;De Dimensione Terrae (1550)&quot; ==
Peucer&#x27;s &quot;De Dimensione Terra&quot; [&quot;On the Dimensions of the Earth&quot;] was first published in 1550, when Peucer was 25. was intended as a textbook of mathematical geography for the study of philosophy by students of the Lutheran University of Wittenberg. This octavo covers matters of physics, astronomy, astrology, and history. It built upon Melancthon&#x27;s work, in the form of relatively simple figures for the ease of comprehension for its intended audience; however, mathematics calculations in the latter part of the book were far above the capability of the average Wittenberg student. Although it was originally published in 1550, it was subsequently updated 3 times in 1554, 1579, and 1587.

The original 1550 edition incorporated figures explaining the measurement of spheres and the determination of geographical coordinates. The 1554 edition adds to this by providing the calculations necessary for discerning the distance between two points from coordinates. The works found in this book are based on the trigonometric tables of Copernicus, the flat and spherical geometry developments of Georg Joachim Rheticus, and works of Johnannes Regiomantus. Another interesting addition to the 1554 version is the inclusion of two works that describe the Holy Land by Burchard of Mount Sion and an explanation of Biblical place names. The religious tie-in arises from Peucer&#x27;s belief that the ability of man to calculate the nature of the earth reveals the &quot;action of Divine Providence in the world.&quot;

In the first chapter, this point is hammered home as it implies that history must be inferred or understood in terms of its Christian context. Thus, Geography should then be thought of in mainly mathematical terms as opposed to historical or ethnic descriptions. Furthermore, in the second part of his work, he reiterates a foundation of longitude and latitude known by many at the time. However, in his work he aims to inspire his audience to make inferences of their own and improve the status quo of cartography to a certain extent. First, the calculation of longitude required two people in different places to record the same celestial event as well as the time it occurred to calculate the difference of longitude in units of time. This highlights many problems including the need for an accurate depiction of time and coordination between many people in different places.  In other words, many maps of the time were the product of an accumulation of knowledge and surveys over time, but some may be slightly inaccurate or not scientific enough. He is more concerned with the systematic measurement and calculations of distances, of maps and areas, inspiring him to attempt to improve maps from mere descriptions of general locations of areas with possible errors, to in-depth mathematical and descriptive maps that can withstand the test of time. He then goes on to describe the methods in depth for calculating the distance between two fixed points using the equators, poles, meridians, longitude, and latitude to create an imaginary triangle. Then using relatively simple trigonometric functions using angles, you can reach a mathematically deduced number.

Peucer recognized that the advanced mathematics used in the latter parts of his work may have been inaccessible to many of his students. In the end of his book essentially suggested to students that they might reject his overly complicated methods and use the pre-established way of calculating distances to better suit their needs. This in turn allowed classes that would use his work the option to stop at the foundational level of mathematics mentioned in the beginning or to go on to the latter part of the book which has math compared to that of a master&#x27;s degree or higher in terms of complexity. While the work as a whole seems ever too complicated for a common student to understand, there seems to be evidence of the use of this work in mathematics classes until the late 1580s with many copies of the book distributed around libraries throughout Europe.

== Influences ==
Caspar Peucer studied a variety of topics throughout his life, but some of his most recognized work are his contributions to the arts and sciences, particularly astrology and medicine. Although some of his views are not completely in line with these figures, his work was influenced by the ideas of Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Copernicus. He, along with many of his peers, was more receptive to the ideologies of Aristotle and Ptolemy. He took a liking to the geocentric world system of Aristotle and Ptolemy, rather than the heliocentric world system created by Copernicus. In the Copernican world system, the sun is the center of the universe, rather than the earth, and everything rotates around the sun. Peucer formulated a geometrical construction of the universe to illustrate the movement of heavenly bodies. Despite the differences in the view of the world system, like Copernicus, Peucer used the significance of light and optics as a means of explaining natural law.

Another figure that not only influenced Peucer, but also directly contributed to a great deal of his work is Philipp Melanchthon. Melanchthon is best known for his works in theology, particularly, his work on the theory of natural law. Peucer was a part of Melanchthon&#x27;s inner circle of pupils, and later became his son-in-law after marrying his daughter, Magdalena. Melanchthon&#x27;s pupils also included members Erasmus Reinhold, Hieronymous Wolf, Jacob Milich, and many others. Melanchthon&#x27;s inner circle or those who closely followed his teachings are respectfully referred to as the &#x27;Philippists&#x27;. They studied and formulated many works under the teaching of Melanchthon. The pupils viewed Melanchthon as one of the only scholars who could actually properly interpret the divine providence and celestial writing through his knowledge of astrology. The Philippists studied or were rather inspired by the works of Girolamo Cardano. Cardano was a professor of medicine known in the Republic of Letters for his medical, philosophical, mathematical, and astrological works. In the mid-1540s, he published a formula for solving cubic equations in his &quot;Ars Magna&quot;. However, this group was mainly influenced by Cardano&#x27;s contribution to the studies of horoscopes. Cardano is famous for drawing horoscopes for both the living and dead. He later was tried by the Roman Inquisition, which found his astrological ideas especially problematic.

Tycho Brahe, another well-known astronomer during this period, was not so much an influence to Peucer&#x27;s work, but they did share their views with each other. Tycho very much disagreed with some aspects of Ptolemy&#x27;s view of the cosmos. He did not like his approach to the motions of the heavens, and use of the equant point. Peucer, on the other hand, took a liking to Ptolemy&#x27;s views. In 1588, Brahe wrote a letter to Peucer addressing where he felt Ptolemy fell short, and how the Copernican system provided a resolution for the shortcomings. Despite Brahe&#x27;s letter to Peucer criticising Ptolemy and defending Copernicus, both he and Peucer disapproved earth&#x27;s movement in the Copernican system. Brahe and Peucer have a history of exchanges, where they share their views on particular aspects of natural philosophy, but it is unclear if they actually contributed to or worked together to learn more about the cosmos.

<text>The one-drop rule was a legal principle of racial classification that was prominent in the 20th-century United States. It asserted that any person with even one ancestor of African ancestry (&quot;one drop&quot; of &quot;black blood&quot;) is considered black (&quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;colored&quot; in historical terms). It is an example of hypodescent, the automatic assignment of children of a mixed union between different socioeconomic or ethnic groups to the group with the lower status, regardless of proportion of ancestry in different groups.

This concept became codified into the law of some U.S. states in the early 20th century. It was associated with the principle of &quot;invisible blackness&quot; that developed after the long history of racial interaction in the South, which had included the hardening of slavery as a racial caste system and later segregation. Before the rule was outlawed by the Supreme Court in the &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; decision of 1967, it was used to prevent interracial marriages and in general to deny rights and equal opportunities and uphold white supremacy.

==Antebellum conditions==

Before the American Civil War, free individuals of mixed race (free people of color) were considered legally white if they had less than either one-eighth or one-quarter African ancestry (only in Virginia). Many mixed-race people were absorbed into the majority culture based simply on appearance, associations and carrying out community responsibilities. These and community acceptance were the more important factors if a person&#x27;s racial status were questioned, not their documented ancestry.

Based on late 20th-century DNA analysis and a preponderance of historical evidence, US president Thomas Jefferson is widely believed to have fathered the six mixed-race children with his slave Sally Hemings, who was herself three-quarters white and a paternal half-sister of his wife Martha Wayles Jefferson. Four of them survived to adulthood. Under Virginia law of the time, while their seven-eighths European ancestry would have made them legally white if they&#x27;d been free, being born to an enslaved mother made them automatically enslaved from birth. Jefferson allowed the two oldest to escape in 1822 (freeing them legally was a public action he elected to avoid because he would have had to gain permission from the state legislature); the two youngest he freed in his 1826 will. Three of the four entered white society as adults. Subsequently, their descendants identified as white.

Although racial segregation was adopted legally by southern states of the former Confederacy in the late 19th century, legislators resisted defining race by law as part of preventing interracial marriages. In 1895, in South Carolina during discussion, George D. Tillman said,

It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of ... colored blood ... It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice, and greed.

The one-drop rule was not formally codified as law until the 20th century, from 1910 in Tennessee to 1930 as one of Virginia&#x27;s &quot;racial integrity laws&quot;, with similar laws in several other states in between.

==Native Americans==

Prior to colonization, and still in traditional communities, the idea of determining belonging by degree of &quot;blood&quot; was, and is, unheard of. Native American tribes did not use blood quantum law until the U.S. government introduced the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, instead determining tribal status on the basis of kinship, lineage and family ties. However, many land cession treaties, particularly during Indian removal in the 19th century, contained provisions for &quot;mixed-blood&quot; descendants of European and native ancestry to receive either parcels of land ceded in the treaty, or a share in a lump sum of money, with specifications as to the degree of tribal ancestry required to qualify. Though these did not typically apply a one-drop rule, determining the ancestry of individual claimants was not straightforward, and the process was often rife with fraud.

Among patrilineal tribes, such as the Omaha, historically a child born to an Omaha mother and a white father could belong officially to the Omaha tribe only if the child were formally adopted into it by a male citizen. In contemporary practice, tribal laws around citizenship and parentage can vary widely between nations.

Between 1904 and 1919, tribal members with any amount of African ancestry were disenrolled from the Chitimacha tribe of Louisiana, and their descendants have since then been denied tribal membership.

==20th century and contemporary times==
In 20th-century America, the concept of the one-drop rule has been primarily applied by European Americans to those of native African ancestry, when some Whites were trying to maintain some degree of overt or covert white supremacy. The poet Langston Hughes wrote in his 1940 memoir:
This rule meant many mixed-race people, of diverse ancestry, were simply seen as African-American, and their more diverse ancestors forgotten and erased, making it difficult to accurately trace ancestry in the present day.

Many descendants of those who were enslaved native Africans and trafficked by Europeans and Americans have assumed they have Native American ancestry. Henry Louis Gates Jr.&#x27;s 2006 PBS documentary on the genetic makeup of African Americans, &quot;African American Lives&quot;, focused on these stories of Native American heritage in African-American communities. DNA test results showed, after African, primarily European ancestors for all but two of the celebrities interviewed. However, many critics point to the limitations of DNA testing for ancestry, especially for minority populations.

During World War II, Colonel Karl Bendetsen stated that anyone with &quot;one drop of Japanese blood&quot; was liable for forced internment in camps.

Today there are no enforceable laws in the U.S. in which the one-drop rule is applicable. Sociologically, however, while the concept has in recent years become less acceptable within the Black community, with more people identifying as biracial, research has found that in White society, it is still common to associate biracial children primarily with the individual&#x27;s non-White ancestry.

==Legislation and practice==
Both before and after the American Civil War, many people of mixed ancestry who &quot;looked white&quot; and were of mostly white ancestry were legally absorbed into the white majority. State laws established differing standards. For instance, an 1822 Virginia law stated that to be defined as mulatto (that is, multi-racial), a person had to have at least one-quarter (equivalent to one grandparent) African ancestry. Social acceptance and identity were historically the keys to racial identity. Virginia&#x27;s one-fourth standard remained in place until 1910, when the standard was changed to one sixteenth. In 1930, even the one sixteenth standard was abandoned in favor of a more stringent standard. The act defined a person as legally &quot;colored&quot; (black) for classification and legal purposes if the individual had &quot;any&quot; African ancestry.

Although the Virginia legislature increased restrictions on free blacks following the Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion of 1831, it refrained from establishing a one-drop rule. When a proposal was made by Travis H. Eppes and debated in 1853, representatives realized that such a rule could adversely affect whites, as they were aware of generations of interracial relationships. During the debate, a person wrote to the Charlottesville newspaper:

The state legislators agreed. No such law was passed until 1924, apparently assisted by the fading recollection of such mixed familial histories. In the 21st century, such interracial family histories are being revealed as individuals undergo DNA genetic analysis.

The Melungeons are a group of multiracial families of mostly European and African ancestry whose ancestors were free in colonial Virginia. They migrated to the frontier in Kentucky and Tennessee. Their descendants have been documented over the decades as having tended to marry persons classified as &quot;white&quot;. Their descendants became assimilated into the majority culture from the 19th to the 20th centuries.

Pursuant to Reconstruction later in the 19th century, southern states acted to impose racial segregation by law and restrict the liberties of blacks, specifically passing laws to exclude them from politics and voting. From 1890 to 1908, all of the former Confederate states passed such laws, and most preserved disfranchisement until after passage of federal civil rights laws in the 1960s. At the South Carolina constitutional convention in 1895, an anti-miscegenation law and changes that would disfranchise blacks were proposed. Delegates debated a proposal for a one-drop rule to include in these laws. George D. Tillman said the following in opposition:

In 1865, Florida passed an act that both outlawed miscegenation and defined the amount of black ancestry needed to be legally defined as a &quot;person of color&quot;. The act stated that &quot;every person who shall have one-eighth or more of negro blood shall be deemed and held to be a person of color.&quot; (This was the equivalent of one great-grandparent.) Additionally, the act outlawed fornication, as well as the intermarrying of white females with men of color.Citation needed However, the act permitted the continuation of marriages between white persons and persons of color that were established before the law was enacted.

The one-drop rule was not made law until the early 20th century.Citation needed This was decades after the Civil War, emancipation, and the Reconstruction era. It followed restoration of white supremacy in the South and the passage of Jim Crow racial segregation laws. In the 20th century, it was also associated with the rise of eugenics and ideas of racial purity. From the late 1870s on, white Democrats regained political power in the former Confederate states and passed racial segregation laws controlling public facilities, and laws and constitutions from 1890 to 1910 to achieve disfranchisement of most blacks. Many poor whites were also disfranchised in these years, by changes to voter registration rules that worked against them, such as literacy tests, longer residency requirements and poll taxes.

The first challenges to such state laws were overruled by Supreme Court decisions which upheld state constitutions that effectively disfranchised many. White Democratic-dominated legislatures proceeded with passing Jim Crow laws that instituted racial segregation in public places and accommodations, and passed other restrictive voting legislation. In &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, the Supreme Court allowed racial segregation of public facilities, under the &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine.

Jim Crow laws reached their greatest influence during the decades from 1910 to 1930. Among them were hypodescent laws, defining as black anyone with any black ancestry, or with a very small portion of black ancestry. Tennessee adopted such a &quot;one-drop&quot; statute in 1910, and Louisiana soon followed. Then Texas and Arkansas in 1911, Mississippi in 1917, North Carolina in 1923, Alabama and Georgia in 1927, and Virginia in 1930. During this same period, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Utah retained their old &quot;blood fraction&quot; statutes &quot;de jure&quot;, but amended these fractions (one-sixteenth, one-thirty-second) to be equivalent to one-drop &quot;de facto.&quot;

Before 1930, individuals of visible mixed European and African ancestry were usually classed as mulatto, or sometimes as black and sometimes as white, depending on appearance. Previously, most states had limited trying to define ancestry before &quot;the fourth degree&quot; (great-great-grandparents). But, in 1930, due to lobbying by southern legislators, the Census Bureau stopped using the classification of mulatto. Documentation of the long social recognition of mixed-race people was lost, and they were classified only as black or white.

The binary world of the one-drop rule disregarded the self-identification both of people of mostly European ancestry who grew up in white communities, and of people who were of mixed race and identified as American Indian. In addition, Walter Plecker, Registrar of Statistics, ordered application of the 1924 Virginia law in such a way that vital records were changed or destroyed, family members were split on opposite sides of the color line, and there were losses of the documented continuity of people who identified as American Indian, as all people in Virginia had to be classified as white or black. Over the centuries, many Indian tribes in Virginia had absorbed people of other ethnicities through marriage or adoption, but maintained their cultures. Suspecting blacks of trying to &quot;pass&quot; as Indians, Plecker ordered records changed to classify people only as black or white, and ordered offices to reclassify certain family surnames from Indian to black.

Since the late 20th century, Virginia has officially recognized eight American Indian tribes and their members; the tribes are trying to gain federal recognition. They have had difficulty because decades of birth, marriage, and death records were misclassified under Plecker&#x27;s application of the law. No one was classified as Indian, although many individuals and families identified that way and were preserving their cultures.

In the case of mixed-race American Indian and European descendants, the one-drop rule in Virginia was extended only so far as those with more than one-sixteenth Indian blood. This was due to what was known as the &quot;Pocahontas exception&quot;. Since many influential First Families of Virginia (FFV) claimed descent from the American Indian Pocahontas and her husband John Rolfe of the colonial era, the Virginia General Assembly declared that an individual could be considered white if having no more than one-sixteenth Indian &quot;blood&quot; (the equivalent of one great-great-grandparent).

The eugenist Madison Grant of New York wrote in his book, &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; (1916): &quot;The cross between a white man and an Indian is an Indian; the cross between a white man and a Negro is a Negro; the cross between a white man and a Hindu is a Hindu; and the cross between any of the three European races and a Jew is a Jew.&quot; As noted above, Native American tribes which had patrilineal descent and inheritance, such as the Omaha, classified children of white men and Native American women as white.

==Plecker case==
Through the 1940s, Walter Plecker of Virginia and Naomi Drake of Louisiana had an outsized influence. As the Registrar of Statistics, Plecker insisted on labeling mixed-race families of European-African ancestry as black. In 1924, Plecker wrote, &quot;Two races as materially divergent as the White and Negro, in morals, mental powers, and cultural fitness, cannot live in close contact without injury to the higher.&quot; In the 1930s and 1940s, Plecker directed offices under his authority to change vital records and reclassify certain families as black (or colored) (without notifying them) after Virginia established a binary system under its Racial Integrity Act of 1924. He also classified people as black who had formerly self-identified as Indian. When the United States Supreme Court struck down Virginia&#x27;s law prohibiting inter-racial marriage in &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; (1967), it also declared Plecker&#x27;s Virginia Racial Integrity Act and the one-drop rule unconstitutional.

Many people in the U.S., among various ethnic groups, continue to have their own concepts related to the one-drop idea. They may still consider those multiracial individuals with any African ancestry to be black, or at least non-white (if the person has other minority ancestry), unless the person explicitly identifies as white. On the other hand, the Black Power movement and some leaders within the black community also claimed as black those persons with any visible African ancestry, in order to extend their political base and regardless of how those people self-identified.

==Other countries of the Americas==

Among the colonial slave societies, the United States was nearly unique in developing the one-drop rule; it derived both from the Southern slave culture (shared by other societies) and the aftermath of the American Civil War, emancipation of slaves, and Reconstruction. In the late 19th century, Southern whites regained political power and restored white supremacy, passing Jim Crow laws and establishing racial segregation by law. In the 20th century, during the Black Power movement, black race-based groups claimed all people of any African ancestry as black in a reverse way, to establish political power.

In colonial Spanish America, many soldiers and explorers took indigenous women as wives. Native-born Spanish women were always a minority. The colonists developed an elaborate classification and caste system that identified the mixed-race descendants of blacks, Amerindians, and whites by different names, related to appearance and known ancestry. Racial caste not only depended on ancestry or skin color, but also could be raised or lowered by the person&#x27;s financial status or class.

The same racial culture shock has come to hundreds of thousands of dark-skinned immigrants to the United States from Cuba, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, and other Latin American nations. Although many are not considered black in their homelands, they have often been considered black in US society. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, their refusal to accept the United States&#x27; definition of black has left many feeling attacked from all directions. At times, white and black Americans might discriminate against them for their lighter or darker skin tones; African Americans might believe that Afro-Latino immigrants are denying their blackness. At the same time, the immigrants think lighter-skinned Latinos dominate Spanish-language television and media. A majority of Latin Americans possess some African or American Indian ancestry. Many of these immigrants feel it is difficult enough to accept a new language and culture without the additional burden of having to transform from white to black. Yvette Modestin, a dark-skinned native of Panama who worked in Boston, said the situation was overwhelming: &quot;There&#x27;s not a day that I don&#x27;t have to explain myself.&quot;

Professor J. B. Bird has said that Latin America is not alone in rejecting the historical US notion that any visible African ancestry is enough to make one black:

In most countries of the Caribbean, Colin Powell would be described as a Creole, reflecting his mixed heritage. In Belize, he might further be described as a &quot;High Creole&quot;, because of his extremely light complexion.

===Brazil===
People in many other countries have tended to treat race less rigidly, both in their self-identification and how they regard others. Unlike the United States, in Brazil, people tend to consider phenotype rather than genotype. A European-looking person will be considered white, even if they have some degree of ancestry from other races. Brazil has a racial category &quot;pardo&quot; (mestizo or mulatto) specifically for people who, in terms of appearance, do not fully fit as white, nor fully as black.

According to an survey of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistic, to define their own race, Brazilians take into account skin color (73.8%) and family origin (61.6%), as well as physical features (hair, mouth, nose), mentioned by 53.5%. For 24.9%, culture and tradition also play a role in classification, along with economic origin or social class (13.5%) and political or ideological choice (2.9%). 96% of those surveyed said they can identify their race, which debunks the myth that many people in Brazil do not recognize the concept of race.

===Puerto Rico===
During the Spanish colonial period, Puerto Rico had laws such as the &quot;Regla del Sacar&quot; or &quot;Gracias al Sacar,&quot; by which a person of black ancestry could be considered legally white so long as the individual could prove that at least one person per generation in the last four generations had also been legally white. Thus persons of some black ancestry with known white lineage were classified as white, the opposite of the &quot;one-drop rule&quot; in the United States.

==Racial mixtures of blacks and whites in modern America==
Given the intense interest in ethnicity, genetic genealogists and other scientists have studied population groups. Henry Louis Gates Jr. publicized such genetic studies on his two series &quot;African American Lives,&quot; shown on PBS, in which the ancestry of prominent figures was explored. His experts discussed the results of autosomal DNA tests, in contrast to direct-line testing, which survey all the DNA that has been inherited from the parents of an individual. Autosomal tests focus on SNPs.

The specialists on Gates&#x27; program summarized the make-up of the United States population by the following:

* 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% European ancestry (equivalent of one great-grandparent);
* 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25% European ancestry (equivalent of one grandparent);
* 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50% European ancestry (equivalent of one parent) (Gates is one of these, he discovered, having a total of 51% European ancestry among various distant ancestors); and
* 5 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry (equivalent to one great-grandparent).

In 2002, Mark D. Shriver, a molecular anthropologist at Penn State University, published results of a study regarding the racial admixture of Americans who identified as white or black: Shriver surveyed a 3,000-person sample from 25 locations in the United States and tested subjects for autosomal genetic make-up:

* Of those persons who identified as white:
** Individuals had an average 0.7% black ancestry, which is the equivalent of having 1 black and 127 white ancestors among one&#x27;s 128 5×great-grandparents.
** Shriver estimates that 70% of white Americans have no African ancestors (in part because a high proportion of current whites are descended from more recent immigrants from Europe of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, rather than those early migrants to the colonies, who in some areas lived and worked closely with Africans, free, indentured or slave, and formed relations with them).
** Among the 30% of identified whites who have African ancestry, Shriver estimates their black racial admixture is 2.3%; the equivalent of having had three black ancestors among their 128 5×great-grandparents.
* Among those who identified as black:
** The average proportion of white ancestry was 18%, the equivalent of having 22 white ancestors among their 128 5×great-grandparents.
** About 10% have more than 50% white ancestry.

Black people in the United States are more racially mixed than white people, reflecting historical experience here, including the close living and working conditions among the small populations of the early colonies, when indentured servants, both black and white, and slaves, married or formed unions. Mixed-race children of white mothers were born free, and many families of free people of color were started in those years. 80 percent of the free African-American families in the Upper South in the censuses of 1790 to 1810 can be traced as descendants of unions between white women and African men in colonial Virginia, not of slave women and white men. In the early colony, conditions were loose among the working class, who lived and worked closely together. After the American Revolutionary War, their free mixed-race descendants migrated to the frontiers of nearby states along with other primarily European Virginia pioneers. The admixture also reflects later conditions under slavery, when white planters or their sons, or overseers, frequently raped African women. There were also freely chosen relationships among individuals of different or mixed races.

Shriver&#x27;s 2002 survey found different current admixture rates by region, reflecting historic patterns of settlement and change, both in terms of populations who migrated and their descendants&#x27; unions. For example, he found that the black populations with the highest percentage of white ancestry lived in California and Seattle, Washington. These were both majority-white destinations during the Great Migration of 1940–1970 of African Americans from the Deep South of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi. Blacks sampled in those two locations had more than 25% white European ancestry on average.

As noted by Troy Duster, direct-line testing of the Y-chromosome and mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) fails to pick up the heritage of many other ancestors. DNA testing has limitations and should not be depended on by individuals to answer all questions about heritage. Duster said that neither Shriver&#x27;s research nor Gates&#x27; PBS program adequately acknowledged the limitations of genetic testing.

Similarly, the Indigenous Peoples Council on Biocolonialism (IPCB) notes that: &quot;Native American markers&quot; are not found solely among Native Americans. While they occur more frequently among Native Americans, they are also found in people in other parts of the world. Genetic testing has shown three major waves of ancient migration from Asia among Native Americans but cannot distinguish further among most of the various tribes in the Americas. Some critics of testing believe that more markers will be identified as more Native Americans of various tribes are tested, as they believe that the early epidemics due to smallpox and other diseases may have altered genetic representation.

Much effort has been made to discover the ways in which the one-drop rule continues to be socially perpetuated today. For example, in her interview of black/white adults in the South, Nikki Khanna uncovers that one way the one-drop rule is perpetuated is through the mechanism of reflected appraisal. Most respondents identified as black, explaining that this is because both black and white people see them as black as well.

==Allusions==
Charles W. Chesnutt, who was of mixed race and grew up in the North, wrote stories and novels about the issues of mixed-race people in southern society in the aftermath of the Civil War.

The one-drop rule and its consequences have been the subject of numerous works of popular culture. The American musical &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1927) opens in 1887 on a Mississippi River boat, after the Reconstruction era and imposition of racial segregation and Jim Crow in the South. Steve, a white man married to a mixed-race woman who passes as white, is pursued by a Southern sheriff. He intends to arrest Steve and charge him with miscegenation for being married to a woman of partly black ancestry. Steve pricks his wife&#x27;s finger and swallows some of her blood. When the sheriff arrives, Steve asks him whether he would consider a man to be white if he had &quot;negro blood&quot; in him. The sheriff replies that &quot;one drop of Negro blood makes you a Negro in these parts&quot;. Steve tells the sheriff that he has &quot;more than a drop of negro blood in me&quot;. After being assured by others that Steve is telling the truth, the sheriff leaves without arresting Steve.

<text>The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) is a United States–based nonprofit organization originally founded as a grassroots group by family members of people diagnosed with mental illness. NAMI identifies its mission as &quot;providing advocacy, education, support and public awareness so that all individuals and families affected by mental illness can build better lives&quot; and its vision as &quot;a world where all people affected by mental illness live healthy, fulfilling lives supported by a community that cares&quot;. NAMI offers classes and trainings for people living with mental illnesses, their families, community members, and professionals, including what is termed psychoeducation, or education about mental illness. NAMI holds regular events which combine fundraising for the organization and education, including Mental Illness Awareness Week and NAMIWalks.

Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, NAMI has around 1,000 state and local affiliates and is represented in all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Funding comes from individual contributions, corporate sponsorships, events, and grants. NAMI publishes a magazine around twice a year called &quot;The Advocate&quot;. NAMI also runs a HelpLine five days a week.

==History==
NAMI was founded in Madison, Wisconsin, by Harriet Shetler and Beverly Young. The two women both had sons diagnosed with schizophrenia, and &quot;were tired of being blamed for their sons&#x27; mental illness&quot;. Unhappy with the lack of services available and the treatment of those living with mental illness, the women sought out others with similar concerns. The first meeting held to address these issues in mental health led to the formation of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill in 1979. In 1997, the legal name was changed to the acronym NAMI by a vote of the membership due to concerns that the name National Alliance for the Mentally Ill did not use person-first language. In 2005, the meaning of NAMI was changed to the backronym National Alliance on Mental Illness.

==Mission==

NAMI identifies its mission as to promote recovery by preserving and strengthening family relationships &quot;affected by mental illness&quot;. NAMI&#x27;s programs and services include education, support groups, informational publications, and presentations. Although originally focused primarily on family members, in more recent years NAMI has moved toward trying to include people diagnosed with mental illness as well (although activists have criticized these efforts). In addition, NAMI has a strong focus on discriminatory attitudes and behaviors about mental illness (what they term stigma); another identified goal is &quot;to increase public and professional understanding&quot;, and &quot;to improve the mental health system&quot;.

==Structure==
The National Alliance on Mental Illness is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit run by a board of directors who are elected by membership. NAMI National is the umbrella organization; state and local affiliates operate semi-independently, in an attempt to more accurately represent those in the surrounding communities. Since 2020, NAMI has been using a five-year strategic plan.

The current chief executive officer is Daniel H. Gillison, Jr., who prior to NAMI led the American Psychiatric Association Foundation (APAF), the nonprofit arm of American Psychiatric Association.

The national chief executive officer from 2014 to 2019 was Mary Giliberti, who resigned on April 24, 2019. Gilberti has a law degree from Yale University and clerked for Judge Phyllis A. Kravitch. Before coming to NAMI, Giliberti worked as a senior attorney at Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law for almost ten years and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee from 2008 to 2014. She worked for NAMI National during this time as the director of public policy and advocacy for federal and state issues. In 2017, she was &quot;appointed by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) to serve as one of 14 non-federal members of HHS’ Interdepartmental Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee.&quot;

National and state NAMI organizations function to provide Governance, Public Education, Political Advocacy, and management of NAMI&#x27;s Educational Programs. At the local level, local NAMI chapters also provide assistance in obtaining mental health resources, scheduling and administration of NAMI&#x27;s programs, and hosting local meetings and events for NAMI members.

In February 2020, NAMI Sioux Falls merged with the South Dakota Office. The move was a result of a decision by the national NAMI office.

== Partnerships ==

=== Celebrities ===
NAMI has partnered with a number of celebrities and influencers, including:

=== CEO Alliance for Mental Health ===
Beginning in 2020, NAMI CEO Daniel Gillison, Jr. has assembled a coalition of leaders of national mental health organizations to &quot;chart a new course&quot; for the country&#x27;s care system. The coalition includes representatives from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, Massachusetts Association of Mental Health, Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute, Mental Health America, National Association for Behavioral Healthcare, National Council for Mental Wellbeing, and Treatment Advocacy Center, among others.

=== Community partners ===
NAMI works with non-partisan VoteRiders to spread state-specific information on voter ID requirements.

Additional partners include:

* Alpha Kappa Alpha
* Counter Logic Gaming
* Fox Sports
* HOSA-Future Health Professionals
* Instagram
* Jack and Jill of America
* The Jed Foundation
* Lokai
* Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at Broad Institute
* Tumblr
* &quot;Women&#x27;s Health&quot;

==Philosophy and positions==
NAMI generally endorses a medical model approach to mental illnesses, and previously was a major proponent of terming them &quot;serious brain disorders&quot; during the &quot;decade of the brain&quot;. NAMI endorses the term anosognosia, or &quot;that someone is unaware of their own mental health condition or that they can’t perceive their condition accurately&quot;. While NAMI previously referred to mental illnesses as &quot;serious brain disorders&quot;, current advice on their &quot;How we talk about NAMI&quot; page recommends against this language.

=== Advocacy ===
NAMI advocates to improve the lives of people affected by mental health conditions. Their policy priorities include improving healthcare, crisis response, and stopping discrimination and harmful practices.

==Programs==
NAMI programs are generally in the area of support and education for individuals and families, often for no cost. The programs are set up through local NAMI Affiliate organizations, with different programs varying in their targeted audience.

===NAMI Family-to-Family===
The NAMI Family-to-Family Education Program is a free eight-week course targeted toward family and friends of individuals with mental illness, providing education from a medical model perspective of mental illness. Originally offered as a twelve-week program, but updated to a shorter model in 2020, the courses are taught by a NAMI-trained family member of a person diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Family-to-Family is taught in 44 states, and two provinces in Canada. The program was developed by clinical psychologist Joyce Burland. Facilitators are required to teach material from the curriculum without alteration.

====Purpose====
The Family-to-Family program provides general information about mental illness and how it is currently treated from a medical model perspective. The programs cover mental illnesses including schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, etc., as well as the indications and side effects of medications. Family-to-Family takes a biologically-based approach to explaining mental illness and its treatments.

According to the NAMI website, Family-to-Family program states its goals as teaching coping and advocacy skills, providing mutual support, how to &quot;handle a crisis&quot;, &quot;information on mental health conditions and how they affect the brain&quot;, and locating resources in the community

====Evidence Base====
The NAMI Family-to-Family program has initial research evidence; one randomized clinical trial showed gains in empowerment, increases in problem solving and reductions in participant anxiety scores following the class; these changes persisted at 6 month follow up. These studies confirm an earlier finding that Family-to-Family graduates describe a permanent transformation in the understanding and engagement with mental illness in themselves and their family. Because a randomized controlled trial is at risk of poor external validity by mechanism of self-selection, Dixon and colleges sought out to strengthen the evidence base by confirming the benefits attributed to Family-to-Family with a subset of individuals who declined participation during initial studies

The NAMI Family-to-Family program was found to increase self efficacy in family members involved in caring for a family member with schizophrenia while reducing subjective burden and need for information. In light of recent research, Family-to-Family was added to the SAMHSA National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP), although as of January 2018 this database and designation has been eliminated by SAMHSA.

===NAMI Peer-to-Peer===

The NAMI Peer-to-Peer is an eight-week educational program aimed at adults diagnosed with a mental illness. The NAMI Peer-to-Peer program describes the course as a holistic approach to recovery through lectures, discussions, interactive exercises, and teaching stress management techniques. The program provides information about biological explanations of mental illness, symptoms, and personal experiences. The program also includes information about interacting with healthcare providers as well as decision making and stress reducing skills. The Peer-to-Peer philosophy is advertised as being centered around certain values such as individuality, autonomy, and unconditional positive regard. The program is also available in Spanish

Preliminary studies have suggested Peer-to-Peer provided many of its purported benefits (e.g. self-empowerment, disorder management, confidence). Peer interventions in general have been studied more extensively, having been found to increase social adjustment

===NAMI In Our Own Voice===

The NAMI In Our Own Voice (IOOV) program started as a mental health consumer education program for people living with schizophrenia in 1996, and was further developed to IOOV with grant funding from Eli Lily &amp; Co. in 2002. The program was based on the idea that those successfully living with mental illness were experts in a sense, and sharing their stories would benefit those with similar struggles. The program approached this by relaying the idea that recovery is possible, attempting to build confidence and self-esteem. Because of the initial success of the program and positive reception, IOOV also took on the role of public advocacy.

NAMI In Our Own Voice involves two trained speakers presenting personal experiences related to mental illness, in front of an audience. Unlike the majority of NAMI&#x27;s programs, IOOV consists of a single presentation educating groups of individuals with the acknowledgement many are likely unfamiliar with mental illness. The program&#x27;s aims include raising awareness regarding NAMI and mental illness in general, addressing stigma, and empowering those affected by mental illness. Other than those directly affected by mental illness, In Our Own Voice often educates groups of individuals like law enforcement, politicians, and students.

In Our Own Voice has been shown to be superior at reducing self stigmatization of families when compared to clinician led education. Research into the effectiveness of the NAMI In Our Own Voice program has shown the program also can be of benefit to Graduate level therapists and adolescents. A 2016 study evaluating IOOV in California found significant reductions in desire for social distancing after attending an IOOV presentation, although no validated measures were used in the evaluation.

===NAMI Basics===
The NAMI Basics Program is a six-session course for parents or other primary caregivers of children and adolescents living with mental illness. NAMI Basics is conceptually similar to NAMI Family-to-Family in that it aims to educate families, but recognizes providing care for a child living with mental illness presents unique challenges in parenting, and that mental illness in children typically manifest differently than in adults. Because of the development of the brain and nervous system throughout childhood and adolescence, information regarding mental illness biology and its presentation is fundamentally different from with adults. The NAMI Basics program has a relatively short time course to accommodate parents&#x27; difficulty in attending because of their caregiver status.

===NAMI Connection===
The NAMI Connection Recovery Support Group Program is a weekly support group for adults living with mental illness. The program is for adults 18+ diagnosed with mental illness and groups are usually weekly for 90 minutes. The support groups are led by trained facilitators who identify as having experienced mental illness themselves.

===NAMI On Campus===

NAMI On Campus is an initiative for university students to start NAMI On Campus organizations within their respective universities. NAMI On Campus was started to address the mental health issues of college-aged students. Adolescence and early adulthood are periods where the onset of mental illness is common, with 75 percent of mental illnesses beginning by age 24. When asked what barriers, if any, prevented them from gaining support and treatment, surveys found stigma to be the number one barrier.

=== Ending the Silence ===
This 50-minute or one hour program is available for students, school staff, and family members. It involves two presenters: one who shares educational information and one who is a young adult living well in recovery who shares their personal story. This program has been shown to improve the mental health knowledge of middle- and high school students.

In 2017, Former Second Lady of the United States Tipper Gore gave a $1 million donation to the Ending the Silence program.

==Funding==

NAMI receives funding from both private and public sources, including corporations, federal agencies, foundations and individuals. NAMI maintains that it is committed to avoiding conflicts of interest and does not endorse nor support any specific service or treatment. Records of NAMI&#x27;s quarterly grants and contributions since 2009 are freely available on its website.

In 2017, NAMI had a 16% increase in overall revenue.

=== Corporate sponsors ===
NAMI&#x27;s current and recent corporate sponsors include:

=== NAMIWalks ===
The 2017 annual report noted &quot;$11.3 million raised across the country by 68,000 participants.&quot;

=== COVID-19 Mental Health Support Fund ===
NAMI launched the COVID-19 Mental Health Support Fund in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fund received donations from its corporate partners as well as the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, Hearst Foundation, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kind, LivaNova, Starbucks and Thrive Global. NAMI also launched the Frontline Wellness program to support healthcare workers, funded by the American College of Emergency Physicians, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and various corporations.

===Criticism===

The funding of NAMI by multiple pharmaceutical companies was reported by the investigative magazine &quot;Mother Jones&quot; in 1999, including that an Eli Lilly and Company executive was then &quot;on loan&quot; to NAMI working out of NAMI headquarters.

During a 2009 investigation into the drug industry&#x27;s influence on the practice of medicine, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) sent letters to NAMI and about a dozen other influential disease and patient advocacy organizations asking about their ties to drug and device makers. The investigation confirmed pharmaceutical companies provided a majority of NAMI&#x27;s funding, a finding which led to NAMI releasing documents listing donations over $5,000.

Dr. Peter Breggin, a leader of the anti-psychiatry movement and opponent of COVID-19 lockdowns, refers to NAMI as an &quot;AstroTurf lobbying organization&quot; of the &quot;psychopharmaceutical complex.&quot;

<doc id="535796" wikidata="Q165728" url="?curid=535796" title="Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch">
<text>The Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (, ), abbreviated BGB, is the civil code of Germany, codifying most generally-applicably private law. In development since 1881, it became effective on 1 January 1900, and was considered a massive and groundbreaking project.

The BGB served as a template in several other civil law jurisdictions, including Japan, Korea, Republic of China (Taiwan), Thailand, Brazil, Greece, Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine. It also had a major influence on the 1907 Swiss Civil Code, the 1942 Italian Civil Code, the 1966 Portuguese Civil Code, and the 1992 reformed Dutch Civil Code.

==History==
===German Empire===
The introduction in France of the Napoleonic code in 1804 created in Germany a similar desire to draft a civil code (despite the opposition of Friedrich Carl von Savigny’s Historical School of Law) which would systematize and unify the various heterogeneous laws that were in effect in the country. However, such an undertaking during the German Confederation would have been difficult because the appropriate legislative body did not exist.

In 1871, most of the various German states were united into the German Empire. In the beginning, civil law legislative power was held by the individual states, not the Empire (&quot;Reich&quot;) that was composed of those states. An amendment to the constitution passed in 1873 (named Lex Miquel-Lasker in reference to the amendment&#x27;s sponsors, representatives Johannes von Miquel and Eduard Lasker) transferred this legislative authority to the Reich. Various committees were then formed to draft a bill that was to become a civil law codification for the entire country, replacing the civil law systems of the states.

A first draft code, in 1888, did not meet with favour. A second committee of 22 members, comprising not only jurists but also representatives of financial interests and of the various ideological currents of the time, compiled a second draft. After significant revisions, the BGB was passed by the Reichstag in 1896. It was put into effect on 1 January 1900, and has been the central codification of Germany&#x27;s civil law ever since.

===Nazi Germany===
In Nazi Germany, there were plans to replace the BGB with a new codification that was planned to be entitled &quot;Volksgesetzbuch&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s code&quot;), which was meant to reflect Nazi ideology better than the BGB, but these plans did not become reality. However, some general principles of the BGB such as the doctrine of good faith (§ 242 BGB, &quot;Grundsatz von Treu und Glauben&quot;) were used to interpret the BGB in a Nazi-friendly way. Therefore, the political need to draft a completely new code to match the Nazis&#x27; expectations subsided, and instead the many flexible doctrines and principles of the BGB were re-interpreted to meet the (legal) spirit of that time. Especially through the good faith doctrine in § 242 BGB (see above) or the &quot;contra bonos mores&quot; doctrine in § 138 BGB (&quot;sittenwidriges Rechtsgeschäft&quot;), voiding transactions perceived as being &quot;contra bonos mores&quot;, i.e. against public policy or morals, the Nazis and their willing judges and lawyers were able to direct the law in a way to serve their nationalist ideology.

===Germany after 1945===
When Germany was divided into a democratic capitalist state in the West and a socialist state in the East after World War II, the BGB continued to regulate the civil law in both parts of Germany. Over time the BGB regulations were replaced in East Germany by new laws, beginning with a family code in 1966 and ending with a new civil code (&quot;Zivilgesetzbuch&quot;) in 1976 and a contract act in 1982. Since Germany&#x27;s reunification in 1990, the BGB has again been the codification encompassing the civil law of Germany.

In West and reunited Germany, the BGB has been amended many times. The most significant changes were made in 2002, when the Law of Obligations, one of the BGB&#x27;s five main parts, was extensively reformed. Despite its status as a civil code, legal precedent does play a limited role; the way the courts construe and interpret the regulations of the code has changed in many ways, and continues to evolve and develop, due particularly to the high degree of abstraction throughout. In recent years lawmakers have tried to bring some outside legislation &quot;back into the BGB&quot;. For example, aspects of tenancy legislation, which had been transferred to separate laws such as the &quot;Miethöhegesetz&quot; (&quot;Rental Rate Act&quot;) are once again covered by the BGB.

The BGB continues to be the centerpiece of the German legal system. Other legislation builds on principles defined in the BGB. The German Commercial Code, for example, contains only those rules relevant to merchant partnerships and limited partnerships, as the general rules for partnerships in the BGB also apply.

The BGB is typical of 19th century legislation and has been criticized from its very beginnings for its lack of social responsibility. Lawmakers and legal practice have improved the system over the years to adapt the BGB in this respect with more or less success. Recently, the influence of EU legislation has been quite strong and the BGB has seen many changes as a result.

==Structure==
The BGB follows a modified pandectist structure, derived from Roman law: like other Roman-influenced codes, it regulates the law of persons, property, family and inheritance, but unlike the French Code civil or the Austrian Civil Code, a chapter containing generally applicable regulations is placed first. Consequently, the BGB contains five main parts (or &quot;books&quot;):
*the general part (&quot;allgemeiner Teil&quot;), Sections 1 through 240, comprising regulations that have effect on all the other four parts, such as personhood and civil status, emancipation, legal capacity, declarations of will, rescission, formation of contracts, limitation periods, and agency
*law of obligations (&quot;Schuldrecht&quot;), Sections 241 through 853, describing contractual obligations and other civil obligations, including torts and unjust enrichment
*property law (&quot;Sachenrecht&quot;), Sections 854 through 1296, describing possession, ownership, other property rights (e.g. servitudes, security interests, rentcharge, land charge), and how those rights can be transferred.
*family law (&quot;Familienrecht&quot;), Sections 1297 through 1921, describing marriage, marital property schemes, legal guardianship, and other legal relationships among family members
*inheritance law (&quot;Erbrecht&quot;), Sections 1922 through 2385, which regulate what happens to a deceased&#x27;s estate, as well as the law of wills and contracts concerning succession (&quot;pacta successoria&quot;).

==Abstract system of alienation==
One of the BGB&#x27;s fundamental components is the doctrine of abstract alienation of property (German: &quot;Abstraktionsprinzip&quot;), and its corollary, the separation doctrine (&quot;Trennungsprinzip&quot;). Derived from the works of the pandectist scholar Friedrich Carl von Savigny, the Code draws a sharp distinction between obligationary agreements (BGB, Book 2), which create enforceable obligations, and &quot;real&quot; or alienation agreements (BGB, Book 3), which transfer property rights. In short, the two doctrines state: the owner having an obligation to transfer ownership does not make you the owner, but merely gives you the right to &quot;demand&quot; the transfer of ownership. The opposite system, the causal system, is in effect in France and other legal jurisdictions influenced by French law, under which an obligationary agreement is sufficient to transfer ownership; no subsequent conveyance is needed. The German system thus mirrors the English common law differentiation between &quot;in rem&quot; rights and &quot;in personam&quot; rights. The Chilean Civil Code, which came into force on 1 January 1857, also makes this differentiation between the &quot;titles&quot; and the actual &quot;acquisition&quot; of property, similarly to the Roman Law.

The separation doctrine states that obligationary agreements for alienation and conveyances that effect that alienation must be treated separately and follow their own rules. Also, under the abstract system, alienation does not depend on the validity of the underlying causa of the obligationary contract; in other words, a conveyance is &quot;sine causa&quot; (without legal consideration). From this differentiation it follows that a mere obligationary agreement, such as for the sale of property, does not transfer ownership if and until a separate legal instrument, the conveyance, has been drawn up and goes into effect; conversely, the alienation of property based on an invalid obligationary agreement may give rise to a restitutionary obligation for the transferee to restore the property (e.g. unjust enrichment), but until the property is re-conveyed, again by way of a conveyance, the transferred property is not affected.

Under the BGB, a sales contract alone, for example, would not lead to the buyer acquiring ownership, but merely impose an obligation on the seller to transfer ownership of the sold property. The seller is then contractually obligated to form another, and separate, agreement to transfer the property. Only once this second agreement is formed, the buyer acquires ownership of the purchased property. Consequently, these two procedures are regulated differently: the contracting parties&#x27; obligations are regulated by art. 433, whereas real contracts alienating movable property are provided for under art. 929. The payment of the purchase price (or valuable consideration) is treated likewise.

In day-to-day business, this differentiation is not needed, because both types of contract would be formed simultaneously by exchanging the property for payment of money. Although the abstract system can be seen as overly technical and contradicting the usual common-sense interpretation of commercial transactions, it is undisputed among the German legal community. The main advantage of the abstract system is its ability to provide a secure legal construction to nearly any financial transaction, however complicated this transaction may be.

A good example is retention of title. If someone buys something and pays the purchase price in installments, there are two conflicting interests at play: the buyer wants to have the purchased property immediately, whereas the seller wants to secure full payment of the purchase price. Under the abstract system, the BGB has a simple answer: the sales contract obligates the buyer to pay the full price and requires the seller to transfer property upon receipt of the last installment. As the sale obligations and the actual conveyance of ownership are embodied in two separate agreements, it is quite simple to secure both parties&#x27; interests. The seller maintains ownership of the property until the last payment, while the buyer merely possesses the property. If the buyer defaults, the seller may repossess the property just like any other owner.

Another advantage is that should the sales contract be found defective due to some vitiating factor (e.g. fraud, mistake, or undue influence), this would not affect the seller&#x27;s ownership, thereby making it unnecessary to resell the property for the sake of transferring ownership back to the original seller. Instead, under the rules of unjust enrichment, the buyer is obligated to transfer the property back if possible or otherwise pay compensation.

== Template for other jurisdictions ==
* In 1896 and 1898, the Japanese government enacted a civil code (民法, Minpō) based on the first draft of the &quot;Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch&quot;; with post–World War II modifications, the code remains in effect.
* In 1923, the Government of Siam (Thailand) passed the Act establishing the Civil Code of B.E. 2466 (1923) which put into force the first two books of the Civil Code of Thailand. The enactment of the Civil Code (, Pramuan kodmai phaeng) was a major event in Thai legal history. As one of the few independent Asian countries during the second half of the nineteenth century, the Thai government had desired to adopt the western legal system as a part of the country&#x27;s modernization efforts. The project started in the late nineteenth century and, initially, the Thai Civil Code was based on the French Civil Code. But the advancement of legal science in Germany in the late nineteenth century - which culminated in the enactment of the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch - convinced the government that the German code should be the model for Thailand&#x27;s civil-law codification.

<doc id="535800" wikidata="Q1416492" url="?curid=535800" title="Crypto-Calvinism">
<text>Crypto-Calvinism is a pejorative term describing a segment of those members of the Lutheran Church in Germany who were accused of secretly subscribing to Calvinist doctrine of the Eucharist in the decades immediately after the death of Martin Luther in 1546. It denotes what was seen as a hidden (&quot;crypto&quot;- from meaning &quot;to hide, conceal, to be hid&quot;) Calvinist belief, i.e., the doctrines of John Calvin, by members of the Lutheran Church. The term crypto-Calvinist in Lutheranism was preceded by terms Zwinglian and Sacramentarian. Also, Jansenism has been accused of crypto-Calvinism by Roman Catholics.

== Background ==

Martin Luther had controversies with &quot;Sacramentarians&quot;, and he published against them, for example, in his &quot;The Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ—Against the Fanatics&quot; and &quot;Confession Concerning Christ&#x27;s Supper&quot;. Philipp I of Hessen arranged the Marburg Colloquy in 1529, but no agreement could be reached concerning the doctrine of Real Presence. Subsequently, the Wittenberg Concord of 1536 was signed, but this attempt at resolving the issue ultimately failed.

While Lutheranism had weakened after the Schmalkaldic War and Interim controversies, the Calvinist Reformation was spreading across Europe. Calvinists wanted to help Lutherans to give up &quot;remnants of popery&quot;, as they saw it. By this time Calvinism had expanded its influence to southern Germany (not least because of the work of Martin Bucer), but the Peace of Augsburg (1555) had given religious freedom in Germany only to Lutherans, and it was not officially extended to Calvinists until the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. While Bullinger, Zwingli&#x27;s successor, had, in 1549, accepted Calvin&#x27;s much less radical view of Christ&#x27;s presence in the Lord&#x27;s Supper (that is, that the Eucharist was more than a sign and that Christ was truly present in it and was received by faith), Calvinist theologians thought that Lutheran theology also had changed its view of the Real Presence because the issue was not discussed anymore, and Philippist teaching gave some justification to this conclusion.

== Philippism ==
=== Modern use of the term crypto-Philippist ===
Beginning in the 20th century, some scholars began using the term crypto-Philippist in place of the word crypto-Calvinist. However, there is no change in the meaning of the term.

=== History ===
When Luther died in 1546, his closest friend and ally, Philipp Melanchthon, became the leading Lutheran theologian of the Protestant Reformation. He was by training not a theologian but rather a classics scholar, and his theological approach became more or less irenic both toward Catholicism and toward Calvinism, an approach that his disciples, called Philippists, also followed. This attitude towards the Reformed doctrine of the Eucharist had become evident already in 1540, when Melanchthon had published another version of the Augsburg Confession (&quot;Variata&quot;), in which the article on the Real Presence differed essentially from what had been expressed in 1530. The wording is as follows:

* Edition of 1530: &quot;Concerning the Lord&#x27;s Supper, they teach that the body and blood of Christ are truly present, and are distributed (communicated) to those that eat in the Lord&#x27;s Supper; and they disapprove of those that teach otherwise.&quot;
* &quot;Variata&quot; edition of 1540: &quot;Concerning the Lord&#x27;s Supper, they teach that with bread and wine are truly exhibited the body and blood of Christ to those that eat in the Lord&#x27;s Supper.&quot;

The altered edition was made the basis of negotiations with the Roman Catholics at the Colloquies of Worms and Ratisbon in 1541, and at the later Colloquies in 1546 and 1557. It was printed (with the title and preface of the Invariata) in &quot;Corpus Doctrinae Philippicum&quot; in 1559; it was expressly approved by the Lutheran princes at the Convention of Naumburg in 1561, after Melanchthon&#x27;s death, as an improved modification and authentic interpretation of the Confession, and was adhered to by the Melanchthonians and the Reformed even after the adoption of the Book of Concord (1580). John Calvin also signed it. However, it did not have the legal status given to the original version by the Peace of Augsburg.

=== Second Sacramentarian Controversy ===
The Real Presence for Luther was beyond any doubt: The host consecrated is Christ&#x27;s body, while for Melanchthon the words spoken during the establishment by Jesus only promised that his body and blood were received. Melanchthon rejected the doctrine of ubiquity and spoke about the personal presence of Christ in the Eucharist, without any further definitions. The theology of Melanchthon&#x27;s school in general was opposed by Lutherans, who were called Flacians by their opponents. Later they were called &quot;Gnesio-Lutherans&quot;. Matthias Flacius had been the leader against Philippism in earlier controversies, but even Gnesio-Lutherans did not pay much attention to the doctrine of the Eucharist until Joachim Westphal began, in 1552, to write against those who denied the Real Presence. When John Calvin himself answered him in 1555, there was open, inter-Protestant controversy about Eucharist, which involved Lasco, Bullinger, Ochino, Valerandus Polanus, Beza, and Bibliander on the Reformed side and Timann, Heshusius Paul von Eitzen, Schnepff, E. Alberus, Gallus, Flacius, Judex, Brenz, and Andreä on the Lutheran side. The Colloquy of Worms in 1557 was an attempt to achieve unity among Lutherans, but it failed. 

During these controversies the State Church of the Electorate of the Palatinate, where Philippism predominated, changed from the Lutheran to the Reformed faith under Frederick III (1560). The Heidelberg Catechism, which was written there, was also meant to form bridges between Lutherans and Reformed in Germany – one of its authors, Zacharias Ursinus, was Melanchthon&#x27;s disciple.

=== Great Adoration Controversy ===
There were a number of local controversies, such as the Saligerian Controversy in Lübeck in 1568 and 1574, a controversy in Rostock in 1569, a controversy in Bremen in 1554 involving Melanchthon&#x27;s friend Albert Rizaeus Hardenberg, and a controversy in Danzig in 1561–1562.

The earliest of these incidents had happened with Simon Wolferinus, pastor of St. Andreas at Eisleben in 1543, while Martin Luther still lived. The controversy was also about eucharistic adoration, which was defended by &quot;Gnesio-Lutherans&quot; and also many other Lutherans outside of the Flacian party, including Johann Hachenburg, Andreas Musculus, Jakob Rungius, and Laurentius Petri. This belief was shared by Nikolaus Selnecker, Martin Chemnitz, and Timotheus Kirchner. A feast of victory of genuine Lutheranism over Philippism was celebrated in one of the German principalities with prayers for the preservation of the doctrine of justification and the doctrine of the adoration of the Sacrament. Paul Eber was one of the main Philippist opponents of eucharistic adoration.

== In Saxony ==
Controversy about crypto-Calvinism inside of Lutheran Church divides into two stages: 1552–1574 and 1586–1592. It was the most bitter of all controversies after Luther&#x27;s death.

Crypto-Calvinists had gained the ecclesiastical power in Saxony during the rule of Elector Augustus, but the unquestionably Calvinistic work of Joachim Cureus, &quot;Exegesis perspicua de sacra cœna&quot; (1574) and a confidential letter of Johann Stössel that fell into the elector&#x27;s hands opened his eyes. The heads of the Philippist party were imprisoned and roughly handled, and the Torgau Confession of 1574 completed their downfall. Caspar Peucer, not incidentally Melanchthon&#x27;s son-in-law, was captured and jailed for 12 years in the Königstein Fortress for Crypto-Calvinism. Their cause was thwarted in those territories that adopted the Formula of Concord, although in some others it survived under the aspect of a modified Lutheranism, as in Nuremberg, or, as in Nassau, Hesse, Anhalt, and Bremen, where it became more or less definitely identified with Calvinism.

Crypto-Calvinism raised its head once more in the Electorate of Saxony in 1586, on the accession of Christian I, but on his death five years later it came to a sudden and bloody end with the murder of Nikolaus Krell as a victim to this unpopular revival of Calvinism.

== In Scandinavia ==
In Denmark crypto-Calvinism was represented by Niels Hemmingsen. In Sweden, crypto-Calvinism, which was resisted by Archbishop Olaus Martini, was supported by Duke Charles, uncle of Catholic king Sigismund III Vasa. Calvinism was finally banned at the Uppsala Synod of 1593 by the initiative of Bishop of Turku, Ericus Erici Sorolainen, and Bishop Olaus Stephani Bellinus.

== Later history and evaluation ==

Following the Prussian Union and other Evangelical unions in Germany, today&#x27;s Evangelical Church in Germany is an umbrella organisation of Lutheran, Union, and Reformed church bodies. The Leuenberg Concord (1962) made a similar irenic solution between Lutheran and Calvinist doctrines, while Confessional Lutheran church bodies still continue to see Calvinist teaching on the Lord&#x27;s Supper as a danger to Lutheran faith and identity.

<text>A mat is a hard or soft floor covering that generally is placed on a floor or other flat surface. Mats serve a range of purposes including:
* serving to clean items passed over it, such as a doormat, which removes dirt from the soles of shoes
* protecting that which is above the mat, such as a wrestling or gymnastics mat, or an anti-vibration mat
* protecting that which is beneath the mat, such as a place mat or the matting used in archival framing and preservation of documents and paintings
* providing a regular or flat surface, such as a cushioned computer mousepad

==Types==
=== In domestic settings ===
* In homes or rooms where people sit predominantly on the floor (common in Japan, Korea, India, and formerly China), mats may cover entire rooms, or be used in certain areas for sitting or sleeping. The traditional Japanese style of mat is known as the tatami. Shoes are typically removed before entering these areas to keep out dirt and debris.
* A doormat or door-mat is a flat, usually rectangular but sometimes oval, object, usually placed immediately outside or inside the entrance to a house or other building, to allow people to easily scrub or wipe the soles of their shoes before entering. Doormats are usually made from tough, long-lasting material such as coir, palmyra (palm) fibres and stalks, nylon, rubber, cloth, or aluminium and other metals. A doormat may also be known as a welcome mat, as its location at an entrance constitutes a &quot;welcome&quot; to visitors, and may therefore also bear some word, message or sign of greeting. The lowly purpose for which doormats exist has also led to informal use of the term as a reference to people who behave timidly or passively when exploited by others (see also Caspar Milquetoast).
* A cabinet mat is a mat made of rubber that protects kitchen cabinets, more particularly kitchen sink base cabinets, from leaks, water damage, mold and household item spills that commonly occur in the kitchen sink cabinet.
* A bath mat is used on the floor of a bathroom to provide a warm non-slip surface, and to absorb small amounts of water, much like a towel. 
* A place mat or serving mat is a flat piece of fabric or other type of material used on a table at the points at which dishes and plates will be located during a meal. One of the common purposes of such mats is to provide a thermal and physical barrier between that which is placed on the table, and the table itself—for instance, to stop hot objects from marring the finish.

=== Car mats ===

A car mat is designed to help protect a vehicle&#x27;s carpeted floors. One major use of a car mat is to keep mud, sand and snow from contacting the carpeted floors. Some require fixation points to ensure they remain fixed in position.

Carpet mats and rubber mats differ in a number of ways. Carpet mats are generally tufted and have a rubberised anti-slip backing. On the other hand, rubber car mats are heavy duty and higher durability. While some car mats are the plain colour of rubber, many contain branded company logos, cartoon characters or advertisements. Some are in textile form of carpet material. They can also come in a wide range of colours. The terms universal and custom fit mats differentiate between floor mats that will fit a multitude of different cars and those that are specifically designed to fit only one chassis.

=== Anti-fatigue mats ===
&quot;Anti-fatigue mats&quot; are designed to help a person who is working in a standing position for prolonged periods of time. Most anti-fatigue matting is a combination of an ergonomic pattern and a cushioning underlay. The cushioning causes constant subconscious balance checks and micro movements that stimulate blood flow through the legs and lower extremities. This results in better circulation and less fatigue. The cushioning underlay insulates the feet from the hard surface, cold floors, vibrations, moisture and sound. Their unique design encourages the user to make continual micro-movements which provides a wealth of health benefits, such as minimizing back pain, foot pain, weariness, stress, etc. Anti-fatigue mats are one of the approaches to prevent injuries, caused by working in a standing position. In a study at the Center of Ergonomics at the University of Michigan in 1987, ergonomist Mark Redfern concluded that different standing surfaces can have dramatic effects on physical fatigue. Workers who stood on anti-fatigue mats were able to reduce the level of fatigue and discomfort by as much as 50%. This type of mat is recommended by Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The range of common materials for manufacturing anti-fatigue mats includes vinyl, wood, PVC tubing, rubber, PVC closed cell foam, polypropylene, nitrile rubber. Anti-fatigue mats were initially used in factories and production lines where staff has to stand for the majority of their working shifts.

Anti-fatigue mats come in various types and materials for industrial or commercial applications for a variety of workplace conditions that exist as well as the variety of workplace designs from individual work benches, to large assembly lines or complex manufacturing work stations. Work place environments can vary from dry areas to wet or extremely oily areas. Plus specialized industries may need additional properties such as fire retardant matting for welding, static dissipative matting for electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection, anti-microbial for food industry applications.

Today, this type of ergonomic mat is commonly used during trade shows for floor covering, in hospitals and clinics during surgeries to cover the floor near surgical tables to minimize surgeons fatigue resulted from continuous standing. Also these mats are used in housekeeping, especially for kitchen floors to alleviate fatigue during cooking.

=== Cleanroom mats ===

The purpose of a clean room mat is to keep sterile the areas that require ultimate protection from dirt, bacteria and any contamination brought from outside. Clean room mats are tacky, sticky, non slip mats that possess multiple layers of clean film that effectively capture dirt and dust from foot traffic and wheels. Peel-off mats are made up of multiple sheets of polyethylene film coated with acrylic adhesive that traps particles. Each layer peels off to reveal a new clean surface. The adhesive backing prevents microbial growth and contamination. Mats used outside clean rooms and laboratories are designed to withhold foreign pollution elements. This goal is achieved by a sticky surface that serves as a barrier for debris, dirt and dust adhered to shoe soles. Clean room sticky mats can contain two defensive barriers: the first part is a carpet itself, while the second part is sticky surface mat. Another mat type to be used to protect rooms from pollution is sanitizing foot bath floor mats. The mat itself is a small bath that contains sanitizing liquid. The foot bath bottom is covered with pliable rubber scrapers for effective cleaning of footwear soles while the liquid disinfects them.

An alternative clean room mat is one made from polymeric material. Polymeric products are made from a blend of pure polymeric compounds and have a three- to five-year life cycle. When a polymeric surface becomes dirty, operators can clean it with a sponge and a mop with detergent and dry the surface with a sqee. This quick cleaning process can be incorporated into the facility&#x27;s regular wet-clean cycle.

The mats differ by composition:

* One-piece mats are usually used on the permanent basis. One-piece mats can be handcrafted or factory-made. The standard shapes of one-piece mat are rectangular, square, round and elliptic. One-piece mats are produced in the huge variety of sizes and colors. Real and synthetic materials are used for one-piece mats production.
* Linear length mats are manufactured as rolls that can extend 20 meters up to 40 meters for long production lines, assembly lines and packing lines. Mats are manufactured in standard lengths or factory-made to custom sizes.
* Modular mats, also well known as interlocking tiles or interlocking floor mats, are manufactured using the “jigsaw puzzle” structure. Unlike one-piece mats, modular mats consist of numerous elements that are easily and seamlessly assembled. Compared to other types of mats, interlocking mats come in several sizes, depending on the number of pieces in one kit. Modular mats are a good solution for non-rectangular areas where standard shape mats are useless. Interlocking mats are commonly used on a one-time or temporary basis: fitness centres and sport competitions, trade shows and conferences. Modular mats require less place for storage and can be easily transported.

=== Rubber grass mats ===
Rubber grass mats are used commonly for around play equipment on playgrounds, schools and domestic properties where there is a risk of falling. As one of the most common and simple methods of protecting against a critical fall from height, rubber grass mats are usually simply laid on a grass or soil surface and immediately offer protection against serious harm. Usually made from a virgin rubber material and a featuring a design which is around 90% open cell, the mats allow for grass to grow within the structure, offering a green and free draining solution to improving safety in play areas and playgrounds.

Also used commonly for temporary events, such as festivals or weddings, rubber grass mats can be used to create a removable path or standing area and help to protect the grass from erosion or churn. As the mats are usually simply pegged into the ground and cable-tied to each other, they are usually installed very quickly and can also be removed at speed with minimal to no impact on the turfed surface.

=== Others ===
* an anti-vibration mat, which performs the function of isolating vibration between that which is above the mat and that which is below. Such a mat might typically be used when mounting a heavy machine which vibrates, onto a concrete floor; in the absence of the anti-vibration mat, the machine tend to erode the floor through abrasion. Contrawise, some machines, such as the lithography machines used in chip fabs, need to be isolated from vibrations in their locale, and so are mounted on anti-vibration mats.
* a slipmat, a circular piece of slippery cloth or synthetic material designed to allow disc jockeys to turn or stop vinyl records on record players, or to scratch.
* a bar mat (not beermat), a rectangular piece of rubber or towelling material that is used to protect the counter top and/or soak up spilt drinks in a bar or pub.
* an entrance mat, which performs the function of trapping and retaining dust and soil at the entrances. It will also trap moisture to prevent slip and fall accidents. The purpose is having better indoor environment and better air quality. It should be easier to clean the entrance mat than all the interiors.

==History==

Matting or floor covering or rugs is any of many coarse woven or plaited fibrous materials used for covering floors or furniture, for hanging as screens, for wrapping up heavy merchandise and for other miscellaneous purposes. In the United Kingdom, under the name of &quot;coir&quot; matting, a large amount of a coarse kind of carpet is made from coconut fibre; and the same material, as well as strips of cane, manila hemp, various grasses and rushes, is largely employed in various forms for making doormats. Large quantities of the coconut fibre are woven in heavy looms, then cut up into various sizes, and finally bound round the edges by a kind of rope made from the same material. The mats may be of one colour only, or they may be made of different colours and in different designs. Sometimes the names of institutions are introduced into the mats.
Due to the silky nature and tensile strength, jute mats or mattings have started being used as floor covering or doormats, runners and in different forms. Jute floor coverings consist of woven and tufted and piled carpets. Jute Mats and mattings starting from 1 m width to 6 m width and of continuous length are easily being woven in Southern parts of India, in solid and fancy shades, and in different weaves such as boucle, Panama and herringbone. Jute mats and rugs are made on both powerlooms and handlooms in large volumes in Kerala, India. Indian jute mattings / rugs are being widely used in USA and European countries, due to its soft nature. Jute can be easily bleached, colored or printed, similar to textile fibres, with eco-friendly dyes and chemicals. Hand-knotted jute carpets and mattings are also being made from Kerala, India.

Another type of mat is made exclusively from the above-mentioned coir rope by arranging alternate layers in sinuous and straight paths, and then stitching the parts together. It is also largely used for the outer covering of ships&#x27; fenders. Perforated and otherwise prepared rubber, as well as wire-woven material, are also largely utilized for door and floor mats. Matting of various kinds is very extensively employed throughout India for floor coverings, the bottoms of bedsteads, fans and fly-flaps, etc.; and a considerable export trade in such manufactures is carried on. The materials used are numerous; but the principal substances are straw, the bulrushes Typha elephantina and Typha angustifolia, leaves of the date palm (Phoenix sylvestris), of the dwarf palm (Chamaerops Ritchiana), of the Palmyra palm (Borassus flabelliformis), of the coconut palm (Cocos nucifera) and of the screw pine (Pandanus odoratissimus), the munja or munj grass (Saccharum Munja) and allied grasses, and the mat grasses &quot;Cyperus textilis&quot; and &quot;Cyperus pangorei&quot;.

The mats made from Cyperus pangorei (Korai in Tamil) are called &quot;Korai paai&quot; in Tamil and can be found widely in the households of Tamil Nadu, usually in the size 6 feet by 3 feet. They are usually dyed in colors of bright red, green or purple, resulting in patterns. These mats differ in their levels of flexibility, fineness and price. Pattamadai paai (named after the region Pattamadai, near Tirunelveli) is generally considered the finest &quot;paai&quot;. Many of these Indian grass-mats are examples of elegant design, and the colors in which they are woven are rich, harmonious and effective. Mats made from Vandavasi are also famed and used commonly. These days, along with these natural grass mats, one can also find plastic mats, which are easier to maintain and are cheaper. This class of work obtains in India, Japan and other Eastern countries. Vast quantities of coarse matting used for packing furniture, heavy and coarse goods, flax and other plants, etc., are made in Russia from the bast or inner bark of the lime tree. This industry centres in the great forest governments of Viatka, Nizhniy-Novgorod, Kostroma, Kazan, Perm and Simbirsk.

==Promoting safety and health==
Quality floor mats improve indoor air quality (IAQ) and safety in commercial and residential applications. Studies have shown that most toxic chemicals that end up inside a home are tracked in on people&#x27;s shoes. A well-used door mat can trap and hold dirt and allergens, preventing their spread into the rest of the building, significantly improving IAQ and reducing the need for extensive cleaning. Additionally many floor mats are resistant to welding sparks and can keep employees from slipping on industrial lubricants or water.

Floor mats also provide safe surfaces on which to walk, preventing slips and falls that cause injury and liability damages. Anti-slip mats are now required in many areas to ensure maximum protection for both employees and customers. Specialized anti-slip mats are now available that provide extra resistance to the chemicals and grease that are sometimes found in industrial and food service settings.

Custom made anti-fatigue mats are also used in work areas where employees are required to stand for long periods of time. Employers have found that much muscle strain and injury endured by workers is caused by improper flooring conditions. Non-supportive surfaces cause fatigue and foot, back and neck pain due to impaired circulation. Anti-fatigue mats were shown to improve worker productivity by reducing the number of sick-days and injuries sustained by workers whose mobility would otherwise be restricted.

<text>Potter Stewart (January 23, 1915 – December 7, 1985) was an American lawyer and judge who was an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1958 to 1981. During his tenure, he made major contributions to criminal justice reform, civil rights, access to the courts, and Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.

After graduating from Yale Law School in 1941, Stewart served in World War II as a member of the United States Navy Reserve. After the war, he practiced law and served on the Cincinnati city council. In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Stewart to a judgeship on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In 1958, Eisenhower nominated Stewart to succeed retiring Associate Justice Harold Hitz Burton, and Stewart won Senate confirmation afterwards. He was frequently in the minority during the Warren Court but emerged as a centrist swing vote on the Burger Court. Stewart retired in 1981 and was succeeded by the first female United States Supreme Court justice, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor.

Stewart wrote the majority opinion in cases such as &quot;Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.&quot;, &quot;Katz v. United States&quot;, &quot;Chimel v. California&quot;, and &quot;Sierra Club v. Morton&quot;. He wrote dissenting opinions in cases such as &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot;, &quot;In re Gault&quot; and &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;. He popularized the phrase &quot;I know it when I see it&quot; with a concurring opinion in &quot;Jacobellis v. Ohio&quot;, in which a theater owner had been fined for showing a supposedly obscene film.

==Early life and education==
Stewart was born in Jackson, Michigan in 1915, while his family was on vacation. He was the son of Harriett L. (Potter) and James Garfield Stewart. His father, a prominent Republican from Cincinnati, Ohio, served as mayor of Cincinnati for nine years and was later a justice of the Ohio Supreme Court.

Stewart earned an academic scholarship to attend the prestigious Hotchkiss School, where he graduated in 1933. He then went on to Yale University, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon (Phi chapter) and Skull and Bones, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1937 with a Bachelor of Arts degree &quot;cum laude&quot;. He served as chairman of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;. After studying international law at the University of Cambridge in England for a year, Stewart enrolled at Yale Law School where he graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1941 with a Bachelor of Laws. While at Yale Law School, he was an editor of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; and a member of Phi Delta Phi. Other members of that era included Gerald R. Ford, Peter H. Dominick, Walter Lord, William Scranton, R. Sargent Shriver, Cyrus R. Vance, and Byron R. White. The last would later become his colleague on the United States Supreme Court.

Stewart served in World War II as a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve aboard oil tankers from 1941 to 1945, attaining the rank of lieutenant junior grade. In 1943, he married Mary Ann Bertles in a ceremony at Bruton Episcopal Church in Williamsburg, Virginia (at which his brother Zephalso an initiate of Delta Kappa Epsilon and Skull and Bones, and eventually a professor of classics at Harvardwas the best man). They eventually had a daughter: Harriet (Virkstis), and two sons: Potter Jr. and David. He was in private practice with Dinsmore &amp; Shohl in Cincinnati. During the early 1950s, he was elected to the Cincinnati City Council.

==Sixth Circuit service==

Stewart was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on April 6, 1954, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated by Judge Xenophon Hicks. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 23, 1954, and received his commission on April 27, 1954. His service terminated on October 13, 1958, due to his elevation to the Supreme Court of the United States.

==Supreme Court==

Stewart received a recess appointment from President Eisenhower as an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court on October 14, 1958, to succeed Harold Hitz Burton. He took the judicial oath of office that same day. He was formally nominated to the same position by President Eisenhower on January 17, 1959. Public hearings were held before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 9 and 14, 1959, and the Committee voted on May 5, 1959 to forward his nomination with a favorable report. He was confirmed by the Senate in a 70–17 vote on May 5, 1959. All 17 votes against his confirmation came from Southern Democrats (both senators from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, plus Spessard Holland of Florida). He served as Circuit Justice for the Sixth Circuit from October 14, 1958 to July 3, 1981, and as Circuit Justice for the Fifth Circuit from October 12, 1971 to January 6, 1972.

Stewart came to a Supreme Court controlled by two warring ideological camps and sat firmly in its center. A case early in his Supreme Court career showing his role as the swing vote during that time is &quot;Irvin v. Dowd&quot;.

Stewart was temperamentally inclined to moderate, pragmatic positions, but was often in a dissenting posture during his time on the Warren Court. Stewart believed that the majority on the Warren Court had adopted readings of the First Amendment Establishment Clause (&quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot; (1962), &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot; (1963)), the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination (&quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; (1966)), and the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of Equal Protection with regard to voting rights (&quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; (1964)) that went beyond the framers&#x27; intention. In &quot;Engel&quot;, Stewart found no precedent to remove school sponsored prayer, and in &quot;Abington&quot;, Stewart refused to strike down the practice of school sponsored Bible reading in public schools; he was the only justice who took this position in both cases. Stewart dissented in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965) on the ground that, while the Connecticut statute barring the use of contraceptives seemed to him an &quot;uncommonly silly law&quot;, he could not find a general &quot;Right of Privacy&quot; in the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause.

Before the appointment of Warren Burger as Chief Justice, many speculated that President Richard Nixon would elevate Stewart to the post, some going so far as to call him the front-runner. Stewart, though flattered by the suggestion, did not want again to appear before and expose his family to the Senate confirmation process. He also did not relish the prospect of taking on the administrative responsibilities that were delegated to the Chief Justice. Accordingly, he met privately with the President to ask that his name be removed from consideration.

On the Burger Court, Stewart was seen as a centrist justice and was often influential. He joined the decision in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; (1972), which invalidated all death penalty laws then in force, and he then joined in the Court&#x27;s decision four years later, &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot;, which upheld the revised capital punishment legislation adopted in a majority of the states. Despite his earlier dissent in &quot;Griswold&quot;, Stewart changed his views on the right of privacy and was a key mover behind the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973), which recognized the right to abortion under that right. Stewart opposed the Vietnam War and on a number of occasions urged the Supreme Court to grant certiorari on cases challenging the constitutionality of the war.

Stewart consistently voted against claims of criminal defendants in the area of federal habeas corpus and collateral review. He was concerned about broad interpretations of the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses.

He was the lone dissenter in the landmark juvenile law case &quot;In re Gault&quot; (1967). That case extended to minors the right to be informed of their rights and the right to an attorney, which had been granted to adults in &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot; (1966) and &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot; (1963), respectively.

In the obscenity case of &quot;Jacobellis v. Ohio&quot; (1964), Stewart wrote in his short concurrence that &quot;hard-core pornography&quot; was hard to define, but &quot;I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.&quot; Justice Stewart went on to defend the movie in question (Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;The Lovers&quot;) against further censorship. One commentator opined, &quot;This observation summarizes Stewart&#x27;s judicial philosophy: particularistic, intuitive, and pragmatic.&quot;

Justice Stewart commented about his second thoughts about that quotation in 1981. &quot;In a way I regret having said what I said about obscenity—that&#x27;s going to be on my tombstone. When I remember all of the other solid words I&#x27;ve written,&quot; he said, &quot;I regret a little bit that if I&#x27;ll be remembered at all I&#x27;ll be remembered for that particular phrase.&quot;

===Fourth Amendment===
Before 1967, Fourth Amendment protections were mostly limited to notions of property: possessory geographical locations such as apartments or physical objects.

Stewart&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Katz v. United States&quot; established that the Fourth Amendment &quot;protects people, not places.&quot; Stewart wrote that the government&#x27;s installation of a recording device in a public phone booth violated the reasonable expectation of privacy since the government was committing the &quot;seizure&quot; of callers&#x27; words. &quot;Katz&quot; therefore extended the reach of the Fourth Amendment beyond just physical intrusions and would also protect against the seizure of incorporeal words. In addition, the reach of the Amendment was no longer defined solely by property limits but now went as far as a person&#x27;s reasonable privacy expectation. The &quot;Katz&quot; case made government wiretapping by both state and federal authorities subject to the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s warrant requirements.

In &quot;Chimel v. California&quot; (1969), Stewart wrote an opinion stating that arresting a suspect in his house does not give the police the right to perform a warrantless search of the entire house, only the area surrounding the arrestee.

In &quot;Almeida-Sanchez v. United States&quot; (1973), Stewart wrote that roving patrols of the United States Border Patrol must have some justifiable reason before stopping a car. They could not stop and search automobiles without probable cause merely because a stop was made within from the international border.

In &quot;Whalen v. Roe&quot; (1977), Stewart, in his concurrence, objected to any broad establishment of a right to privacy. He said that prior Court decisions did not &quot;recognize a general interest in freedom from disclosure of private information.&quot;

===Access to courts===
Justice Stewart was a leader in trying to maintain access to federal courts in civil rights cases. Stewart was one of the strongest dissenters in the trend of denying litigants access to the federal courts.

Stewart wrote the Court&#x27;s opinions in &quot;Sierra Club v. Morton&quot; (1972) and &quot;United States v. SCRAP&quot; (1973), broadly laying out the requirements of standing in federal actions.

===Civil rights===
In &quot;Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.&quot; (1968), Stewart extended the 1866 Civil Rights Act to outlaw private refusals to buy, sell, or lease real or personal property for racially-discriminatory reasons. In 1976, Stewart extended the Act again in &quot;Runyon v. McCrary&quot;, which states that private schools open to all white students could no longer exclude black children, and all other offers to contract made to the general public were also made subject to the 1866 Act.

In &quot;Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham&quot; (1965), Stewart held for the Court that police could not use an anti-loitering law to keep civil rights workers from standing or demonstrating on a sidewalk.

In a dissenting opinion in &quot;Ginzburg v. United States&quot;, , Stewart stated, &quot;Censorship reflects a society&#x27;s lack of confidence in itself. It is a hallmark of an authoritarian regime.&quot;

=== Education ===
Stewart authored the concurring opinions for two very controversial cases concerning public education: &quot;San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez&quot; and &quot;Milliken v. Bradley.&quot;

In his for &quot;San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez,&quot; Stewart argues that while the funding method of public education is &quot;chaotic and unjust&quot; it does not in the court&#x27;s opinion, violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 

His for &quot;Milliken v. Bradley&quot; states that because there was no evidence of &quot;de jure&quot; segregation implemented by the school districts in the Metropolitan Detroit area, that neither the school districts nor the state of Michigan were responsible for violating the Constitutional rights of Black Detroiters and thus could not be forced to desegregate their schools. 

Both cases have been cited as some of the worst decisions from the court. 

==Retirement and death==
Stewart announced his retirement from the Court on June 18, 1981, and stepped down on July 3. President Ronald Reagan nominated Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor to succeed Stewart; she would become the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court.

He assumed senior status upon retirement, serving in that status until his death on December 7, 1985. After his retirement, he appeared in &quot;The Constitution: That Delicate Balance&quot;, a 13-episode learning course series broadcast in 1984 about the United States Constitution with Fred W. Friendly.

On January 20 and 21, 1985, Stewart administered the oath of office for Vice President George H. W. Bush. On December 7, 1985, he died from a stroke at a hospital in Hanover, New Hampshire, at the age of 70. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

===Archives===
Most of Stewart&#x27;s personal and official papers are archived at the manuscript Yale University Library in New Haven, Connecticut, where they are now available for research. The files concerning Stewart&#x27;s service were closed to researchers until all the justices with whom Stewart served had left the court; the last of these was Justice John Paul Stevens who considered him his judicial hero. Additional papers also exist in other collections.

In 1989, Bob Woodward disclosed that Stewart had been the primary source for &quot;The Brethren&quot;.

<text>Commutative algebra is the branch of abstract algebra that studies commutative rings, their ideals, and modules over such rings. Both algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory build on commutative algebra. Prominent examples of commutative rings include polynomial rings, rings of algebraic integers, including the ordinary integers formula_1, and p-adic integers.

<doc id="535824" wikidata="Q39613" url="?curid=535824" title="Eurocopter AS565 Panther">
<text>The Eurocopter, later Airbus Helicopters AS565 Panther is the military version of the Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin medium-weight multi-purpose twin-engine helicopter. The Panther is used for a wide range of military roles, including combat assault, fire support, anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, search and rescue, and medical evacuation.

==Development==
During the 1980s, French aerospace firm Aerospatiale decided to develop a purpose-built military version of their Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin. The civil SA365 N variant of the Dauphin was used as the starting point for the project; the new rotorcraft was designed to perform utility, anti-tank, troop-transport, and maritime operations. On 28 February 1984, the military variant prototype, designated as the AS365M and later named Panther, conducted its first flight. A total of three prototypes were built.

In May 1986, Aerospatiale formally launched production of the AS365M, at which point the firm anticipated more than 400 Panthers to be sold in the long term. The first production model, which was initially designated as the AS365 K, was shortly re-designated and became widely known as the AS565 Panther. Early models were powered by a pair of Turbomeca Arriel 1M1 turboshaft engines; in 1995, Eurocopter began offering higher powered versions of the Panther that used the new Turbomeca Arriel 2C engine instead.

In February 2016, Airbus Helicopters promised to relocate the global production line for the AS565 Panther to India if it is selected by the Indian Navy for a proposed utility helicopter acquisition. In April 2016, the production rate of the AS565 Panther was announced to have been substantially increased following a switch from a static production line to a task flow line, as well as a 30 per cent reduction in component lead times.

==Design==
The AS565 Panther is a twin-engine medium-sized multi-mission rotorcraft. It is capable of performing various naval and land-based missions, such as maritime security, search and rescue (SAR), casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), vertical replenishment, surveillance, special forces operations, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and Anti-surface warfare (ASuW). The Panther is powered by a pair of Turbomeca Arriel turboshaft engines, which drives the rotorcraft&#x27;s main rotor as well as the fenestron anti-torque tail rotor device. The flight profile of the Panther has been described as being easy to manoeuver, possessing generous g-force limitations and a high level of stability.

In the commando-transport configuration, the Panther may carry up to 10 fully armed soldiers on board at a time in addition to the two pilots flying the aircraft. The main cabin can be rapidly reconfigured to conduct various roles, such as troop-transport, SAR, and MEDIVAC missions; optional equipment includes a full medical suite, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) camera, emergency flotation, loudspeaker, variable-speed hoist, cargo sling, search light, and a stretcher-support structure.

Various avionics are present upon the Panther; some variants are fitted with the advanced human-machine interface (HMI) glass cockpit. It features the vehicle and engine multifunction display (VEMD), integrated electronic standby instrument (ESI), usage monitoring system (UMS), traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (H-TAWS), and dedicated mission display coupled with a multi-sensor processor, a 4-axis automatic flight control system (AFCS), flight management system (FMS), and an advanced search radar. The design of the cockpit and avionics systems, such as the engine management system, provides a high level of automation as part of an effort to reduce workload upon the pilots. The cockpit was deliberately designed with extra panel space to accommodate future upgrades and additional instrumentation that may be installed.

The principle element of ASW-configured Panthers is the Helicopter Long-Range Active Sonar (HELRAS), a dipping sonar equipped with a descending array of seven projection elements and a receiving array equipped with eight extending arms, which is capable of detecting submarines up to 500 meters below the water&#x27;s surface. According to Airbus Helicopters, the Panther family has been qualified to operate from the flight decks of over 100 classes of NATO vessels, and complies with NATO standardization agreements. The compact size of the Panther has enabled the type to be operated from smaller ocean-going vessels such as corvettes. To aid in shipboard landings under rough sea conditions and high winds, some variants can be furnished with the hydraulic &quot;Harpoon&quot; deck-lock securing device.

The Panther can be armed with several different sets of munitions and armaments, dependent upon the intended role. Munitions include 20mm pod-mounted cannons, 68mm rocket pods, a maximum of eight Mistral air-to-air missiles, or a maximum of eight HOT anti-tank missiles; all of which can be mounted onto a universal weapon support beam. The weapon systems are integrated with a Crouzet HDH-2A electronic sight and the autopilot, the latter of which provides automatic flight handling assistance during weapons deployment to avoid negative tendencies such as nose droop. For improved survivability, the radar signature is reduced due to the use of composite materials across the airframe and the use of the fenestron tail rather than a conventional tail rotor; low infrared paints are also typically applied to the exterior surfaces and jet exhaust dilution devices are installed on the engines to reduce the Panther&#x27;s infrared signature. Damage resistance is increased by the adoption of self-sealing fuel tanks and armor-plated crew seating.

==Operational history==
The French Naval Aviation took delivery of 15 Panthers between 1993 and 1998 for maritime operations. As a response to increasing acts of piracy in the Gulf of Aden, since 2008, Panthers have been routinely dispatched upon multiple French frigates that have conducted deployments in support of Operation Atalanta, a long term pan-European counter-piracy operation. In the Aden, the Panther has been typically used for maritime patrol, surveillance and troop-transport missions, such as the transportation of strike teams and the retrieval of detainees.

In May 2009, France announced a major mid-life upgrade program for the Aeronavale&#x27;s Panther fleet, focused on cockpit upgrades and improved defensive/offensive equipment. The additions and alterations include a new glass cockpit compatible with night vision goggles (NVG), electro-optical sensors, a new anti-jamming radio, Link 11 data-link, and a self-protection system based on that used on the Eurocopter Tiger. On 31 May 2011, the first of 16 &quot;Standard 2&quot; Panthers was delivered back to the French Navy.

In 1988, the Brazilian Army Aviation Command took delivery of its first Panther helicopter, which was produced locally by Helibras. In January 2010, Helibras was awarded a contact to upgrade 34 AS365K Panthers to the new AS365 K2 standard. Changes on the Panther K2 include new Turbomeca Arriel 2C2CG engines which produce 40% more power, a glass cockpit containing new avionics and radio systems, a four-axis autopilot, a new weather radar, NVG-compatibility, and measures to reduce pilot workload, and shall extend the airframe&#x27;s service life for a further 25 years. In March 2014, the first two Panther K2 rotorcraft were delivered to the Brazilian Army. In September 2014, the Panther K2 passed its technical operation evaluation, having reportedly demonstrated a 98% availability rating throughout the trial period, clearing the way for the full modernisation program to proceed.
Following positive experiences of operating a pair of Aerospatiale SA366G Dauphins, the Israeli Air Force opted to procure five AS565MA helicopters, locally designated as &quot;Atalef&quot;. Their mission is to extend the naval reach of Israel&#x27;s defense forces, they can be deployed on board the Israeli Navy&#x27;s Sa&#x27;ar 5-class corvettes when required; the rotorcraft are equipped with long range sensors to identify targets in the Mediterranean and a datalink to convey sensory data to the corvettes, their combined sensory capability has reportedly helped foil several attempted terrorist attacks. The AS565MA is the only rotorcraft in Israeli service capable of locating people at sea during day or night conditions, and can operate in nearly all sea conditions.

During the Gulf War, the Royal Saudi Navy engaged five Iraqi patrol boats using a number of Panther helicopters, a total of 15 AS 15 TT Anti-ship missiles were fired. As of 2015, more than 250 navalised variants of the AS 565MB Panther have been in service with operators across 20 nations.

In 2014, the Indonesian Navy opted to procure 11 ASW-equipped Panthers through Indonesian Aerospace (PTDI); Airbus Helicopters shall produce the base rotorcraft and deliver them to PTDI&#x27;s facility in Bandung, Indonesia and separately install mission systems such as the ASW suite. In the Asian market, the European-built Panther has had limited sales mainly due to export competition from the Chinese-built Harbin Z-9, itself a license-built derivative of the Dauphin alike to the Panther.

<text>The Southwest Islands of Palau are several small islands spread across the Pacific Ocean about 600 km from the main island chain of Palau. They make up the Palauan states of Sonsorol and Hatohobei. The nearshore islands to the southwest of the main island of Palau (Babeldaob), which belong to the states of Koror, Peleliu and Angaur and the unincorporated Rock Islands, are not considered part of the Southwest Islands.

== Geography ==
The Southwest Islands are located some 275 to 325 km southwest of Angaur. These small outer islands, which include Sonsorol, Pulu Ana, and Meriir, are both physically and culturally distinct from the rest of the Palau. The islands are miniature platforms of raised reef composed of coralline limestone. The islands have sandy soils covered with atoll-like forest and brush. The islands are low, and have depressed, swampy interiors. Large stands of coconut palms line the beaches forming the primary resource for the only industry on the islands: copra production. Today, the islands are largely uninhabited as most of the native population lives in Koror or on Ngerekebesang Island. Even so, the natives retain a strong sense of cultural pride in their heritage and a firm commitment to their islands. The state governments operate the vessel connecting with Koror every 3 months. 

The Southwest Islands, grouped by their state, from north to south, are:
* Sonsorol
**Fana (&quot;Fanna&quot;)
**Sonsorol (&quot;Dongosaru&quot;)
**Pulo Anna (&quot;Puro&quot;)
**Merir (&quot;Melieli&quot;)
* Hatohobei
**Tobi Island (&quot;Hatohobei&quot;)
**Helen Reef (&quot;Hotsarihie&quot;)
**Transit Reef (&quot;Pieraurou&quot;)

== Traditional villages ==
There is little information available on traditional village patterns in the Southwest Islands. Osborne noted several individual old dwelling places and one concentration of platforms and pathways. There is some information available on traditional fishing practices. The surrounding ocean provided the primary source of protein and was probably intensely exploited prehistorically. Given the limited amount of land, it is expected that almost all of it would have been intensively exploited by settlement or subsistence activities.

== Culture ==
The people of the Southwest Islands and Tochobei (Tobi) share a cultural heritage that shows close ties with peoples of the central Caroline Islands, more than 1000 km to the northeast and on the other side of Palau. The migration of these people to the Southwest Islands must be one of the truly remarkable events in the prehistory of the Pacific.

<doc id="535836" wikidata="Q1473532" url="?curid=535836" title="Saturated model">
<text>In mathematical logic, and particularly in its subfield model theory, a saturated model &quot;M&quot; is one that realizes as many complete types as may be &quot;reasonably expected&quot; given its size. For example, an ultrapower model of the hyperreals is formula_1-saturated, meaning that every descending nested sequence of internal sets has a nonempty intersection.

==Definition==

Let &quot;κ&quot; be a finite or infinite cardinal number and &quot;M&quot; a model in some first-order language. Then &quot;M&quot; is called &quot;κ&quot;-saturated if for all subsets &quot;A&quot; ⊆ &quot;M&quot; of cardinality less than &quot;κ&quot;, the model &quot;M&quot; realizes all complete types over &quot;A&quot;. The model &quot;M&quot; is called saturated if it is |&quot;M&quot;|-saturated where |&quot;M&quot;| denotes the cardinality of &quot;M&quot;. That is, it realizes all complete types over sets of parameters of size less than |&quot;M&quot;|. According to some authors, a model &quot;M&quot; is called countably saturated if it is formula_1-saturated; that is, it realizes all complete types over countable sets of parameters. According to others, it is countably saturated if it is countable and saturated.

==Motivation==

The seemingly more intuitive notion—that all complete types of the language are realized—turns out to be too weak (and is appropriately named weak saturation, which is the same as 1-saturation). The difference lies in the fact that many structures contain elements that are not definable (for example, any transcendental element of R is, by definition of the word, not definable in the language of fields). However, they still form a part of the structure, so we need types to describe relationships with them. Thus we allow sets of parameters from the structure in our definition of types. This argument allows us to discuss specific features of the model that we may otherwise miss—for example, a bound on a &quot;specific&quot; increasing sequence &quot;cn&quot; can be expressed as realizing the type which uses countably many parameters. If the sequence is not definable, this fact about the structure cannot be described using the base language, so a weakly saturated structure may not bound the sequence, while an ℵ1-saturated structure will.

The reason we only require parameter sets that are strictly smaller than the model is trivial: without this restriction, no infinite model is saturated. Consider a model &quot;M&quot;, and the type Each finite subset of this type is realized in the (infinite) model &quot;M&quot;, so by compactness it is consistent with &quot;M&quot;, but is trivially not realized. Any definition that is universally unsatisfied is useless; hence the restriction.

==Examples==

Saturated models exist for certain theories and cardinalities:

* (Q, &lt;)—the set of rational numbers with their usual ordering—is saturated. Intuitively, this is because any type consistent with the theory is implied by the order type; that is, the order the variables come in tells you everything there is to know about their role in the structure.
* (R, &lt;)—the set of real numbers with their usual ordering—is &quot;not&quot; saturated. For example, take the type (in one variable &quot;x&quot;) that contains the formula formula_3 for every natural number &quot;n&quot;, as well as the formula formula_4. This type uses ω different parameters from R. Every finite subset of the type is realized on R by some real &quot;x&quot;, so by compactness the type is consistent with the structure, but it is not realized, as that would imply an upper bound to the sequence −1/&quot;n&quot; that is less than 0 (its least upper bound). Thus (R,&lt;) is &quot;not&quot; ω1-saturated, and not saturated. However, it &quot;is&quot; ω-saturated, for essentially the same reason as Q—every finite type is given by the order type, which if consistent, is always realized, because of the density of the order.
*A dense totally ordered set without endpoints is a ηα set if and only if it is ℵα-saturated.
* The countable random graph, with the only non-logical symbol being the edge existence relation, is also saturated, because any complete type is isolated (implied) by the finite subgraph consisting of the variables and parameters used to define the type.

Both the theory of Q and the theory of the countable random graph can be shown to be ω-categorical through the back-and-forth method. This can be generalized as follows: the unique model of cardinality &quot;κ&quot; of a countable &quot;κ&quot;-categorical theory is saturated.

However, the statement that every model has a saturated elementary extension is not provable in ZFC. In fact, this statement is equivalent to the existence of a proper class of cardinals &quot;κ&quot; such that &quot;κ&quot;&lt;&quot;κ&quot; = &quot;κ&quot;. The latter identity is equivalent to for some &quot;λ&quot;, or &quot;κ&quot; is strongly inaccessible.

==Relationship to prime models==

The notion of saturated model is dual to the notion of prime model in the following way: let &quot;T&quot; be a countable theory in a first-order language (that is, a set of mutually consistent sentences in that language) and let &quot;P&quot; be a prime model of &quot;T&quot;. Then &quot;P&quot; admits an elementary embedding into any other model of &quot;T&quot;. The equivalent notion for saturated models is that any &quot;reasonably small&quot; model of &quot;T&quot; is elementarily embedded in a saturated model, where &quot;reasonably small&quot; means cardinality no larger than that of the model in which it is to be embedded. Any saturated model is also homogeneous. However, while for countable theories there is a unique prime model, saturated models are necessarily specific to a particular cardinality. Given certain set-theoretic assumptions, saturated models (albeit of very large cardinality) exist for arbitrary theories. For &quot;λ&quot;-stable theories, saturated models of cardinality &quot;λ&quot; exist.

<text>The Royal Danish Army (; ; ) is the land-based branch of the Danish Armed Forces, together with the Danish Home Guard. For the last decade, the Royal Danish Army has undergone a massive transformation of structures, equipment and training methods, abandoning its traditional role of anti-invasion defence, and instead focusing on out of area operations by, among other initiatives, reducing the size of the conscripted and reserve components and increasing the active (standing army) component, changing from 60% support structure and 40% operational capability, to 60% combat operational capability and 40% support structure. When fully implemented, the Danish army will be capable of deploying 1,500 troops permanently on three different continents continuously, or 5,000 troops for a shorter period of time, in international operations without any need for extraordinary measures such as parliamentary approval of a war funding bill.

==History==
Founded in 1614, in the wake of the Kalmar War, the Royal Danish Army was originally designed to maintain Denmark&#x27;s sovereignty and protect her interest. With time, these goals have developed into also encompassing the need to protect freedom and peaceful development in the world with respect for human rights.
The Danish King remained commander in chief throughout the Early Modern period, in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Dano-Swedish War (1657–58) and the Scanian War (1675–1679), the Great Northern War (1700–1721), the Theatre War of 1789/9 and the Napoleonic Wars.
In 1815, however, as a result of continued evolution and division of command, four general commands were created with the King as the supreme authority: the General Command over Zealand, Lolland-Falster, Møn and Bornholm, the General Command over Funen, General Command of the Duchies and General Command for Langeland, Ærø and Tåsinge.

The Royal Danish Army has historically been an integral part of the defence of Denmark and thus involved in warfare, skirmishes and battles continuously to protect her interests. Most notably various territorial wars with Sweden, Russia and Prussia, the Napoleonic Wars on the side of France.

===Recent deployments===

The Royal Danish Army has been committed to a number of United Nations and NATO peacekeeping and unconventional warfare operations since becoming involved in the Yugoslav Wars under UN mandate in 1994, most notably in the famous Operation Bøllebank. The Royal Danish Army was also engaged in the Kosovo War and continues to this day to maintain peacekeeping operations in Kosovo as part of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), together with the Danish Home Guard. In addition, the Royal Danish Army was involved in the War in Iraq from 2003 to 2007 with a significant contingent of soldiers responsible for creating and maintaining peace in the province of Basra, together with the British.

Denmark lost its first soldier in Iraq on 17 August 2003 when Preben Pedersen, a 34-year-old Lance Corporal with the Jutland Dragoon Regiment, became the first coalition soldier not from the United States or Britain to die in the Iraq War. Starting in 2001, the Royal Danish Army was also involved in the War in Afghanistan and the Royal Danish Army and the British Army have been involved in heavy clashes with the Taliban in the Helmand Province, where about 760 Danish soldiers controlled a large battlegroup. The Danish army withdrew its combat forces from Afghanistan in May 2014. After the Afghan National Army took responsibility for the security in Afghanistan in 2015, the Danish army has provided training, advisory and security support as part of Resolute Support Mission.

In an effort to relieve police officers in Copenhagen and at the border control, Danish soldiers replaced police officers in 2017 at different locations, marking the first time in 86 years soldiers were used to keep order in cities.

== Structure of the Royal Danish Army ==

The structure of the Danish army changed in 2015, leaving Danish Division without brigades or support troops directly under its command. The two brigades had only command over combat battalions, as combat support and logistic support units were grouped under various support centres. 1st Brigade consisted of four combat battalions and was tasked with providing troops for international deployments. 2nd Brigade consisted of five battalions and was tasked with the defence of the Danish territory. Support centres contained the army&#x27;s combat support, combat logistic and general support units. This structure was changed in

* Army Command, in Karup
** Major HQ&#x27;s &amp; Combat maneuver units
*** Multinational Division North, in Ādaži (Latvia) part of MNC(NE) force structure.
*** 1st Brigade, in Holstebro
*** 2nd Brigade, in Slagelse
** Regiments
*** Danish Artillery Regiment, in Oksbøl
*** Engineer Regiment, in Skive
*** Signal Regiment, in Fredericia
*** Logistic Regiment, in Aalborg
*** Intelligence Regiment, in Varde
*** Royal Life Guards, in Høvelte
*** Guard Hussar Regiment, in Slagelse
*** Jutland Dragoon Regiment, in Holstebro
*** Schleswig Foot Regiment, in Haderslev

==Equipment==

== Army Aviation Troops ==
The Danish Army Aviation Troops (&quot;Hærens Flyvertropper&quot;) were established in 1923 following the rapid development of military aircraft technology. The Aviation Troops flew two squadrons of Fokker C.V reconnaissance aircraft from 1923 to 1932, when 17 Gloster Gauntlet fighters were purchased to form two new squadrons. 
In 1937, ten Fokker D.XXI fighters were built on licence in the Royal Army Aircraft Factory at Værløse.
As a result of the establishment of the Royal Danish Air Force in 1950, the Army Aviation Troops were disbanded and activities transferred to the new service. During the Cold War the Army created the Royal Danish Army Air Corps (&quot;Hærens Flyvetjeneste&quot;) in 1971 with 12 Hughes OH-6 Cayuse light observation helicopters. In 1974, an additional 4 Hughes OH-6 Cayuse were added. The Army bought 12 Eurocopter Fennec as anti-tank helicopters in 1990. But with the end of the Cold War and the reduction of forces, the 12 Eurocopter Fennec AS 550 and 10 Hughes OH-6 Cayuse (both as utility helicopters) were transferred to the Squadron 724 of the Air Force in 2003, and the Army Air Service disbanded.

==Ranks and insignia==

Each regiment and corps has distinctive insignia, such as a cap badge, berets, Formation patchs or stable belt.
===Commissioned officer ranks===
The rank insignia of commissioned officers.
===Other ranks===
The rank insignia of non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.
==Disbanded Regiments of the Royal Danish Army==
The Army has throughout its long history had many different regiments that have either changed names, been disbanded, or been amalgamated or merged. Since the end of the Cold War has seen many cuts to military expenditure, many regiments have been downsized and merged. Likewise, further development of military tactics have led to a streamlining of the regiments.

<text>Spassk-Dalny (), sometimes called simply Spassk, is a town in Primorsky Krai, Russia, situated on the Prikhankayskaya Flatland on the coast of Khanka Lake.

==Geography==
The relief of the territory is flat, with small hills whose height does not exceed . The territory of the town is crossed by the Spassovka and Kuleshovka Rivers (the latter was until 1972 known as the Santakheza).

===Climate===
Spassk-Dalny has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb), bordering on a monsoon-influenced warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dwb). similar to the rest of Primorsky Krai. Located quite far inland, winters are somewhat harsher than in coastal areas, whereas summers are very warm, wet and humid. Summers are slightly moderated by its lakeside position compared to areas further north or south. The influences of the East Asian monsoon on summer and the cold and dry Siberian High on winter are very present. As a result, winters are very dry and there is not a lot of reliable snowfall.

==History==
The first migrants from Ukraine and the western parts of Russia appeared in the area of today&#x27;s Spassk-Dalny in 1886. They founded the village of Spasskoye, which in 1917 became the town of Spassk-Dalny. During the Russian Civil War, Spassk-Dalny was the arena of hard battles between the White and Red Armies.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Spassk-Dalny serves as the administrative center of Spassky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Spassk-Dalny Town Under Krai Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Spassk-Dalny Town Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Spassk-Dalny Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
Historically, Spassk-Dalny formed as the center of the construction industry of the krai, due to the reserves of limestone, clay, and construction sand in its vicinities. Currently the largest enterprise is JSC Spassktsement, which has been operating since 1907 and can produce up to 3.5 million tonnes of cement per year. The cement plant is represented in the town&#x27;s coat of arms.

Spassk-Dalny has a station on the Trans-Siberian Railway, with passenger trains connecting the town to destinations including Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, and Moscow. The M60 motorway between Khabarovsk and Vladivostok also passes near the town.

For many years during the Cold War, the Soviet Air Forces had an interceptor and reconnaissance base, Spassk-Dalny Airfield near the town. The airfield has been abandoned.

==Culture==
The town features a museum of local lore and Aurora cinema.

There are over twenty monuments of history and culture in Spassk-Dalny, with more than a half of them devoted to the participants of the Civil War in the Russian Far East who supported the Bolsheviks. There are also monuments connected with the events of World War II.
==Notable residents ==

* Natasha Kurnaeva, vlogger of &quot;Yeah Russia&quot; and &quot;Natasha&#x27;s Adventures&quot;
* Volodymyr Veremeyev (born 1948), Soviet and Ukrainian footballer

<text>CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; was a screw sloop-of-war built in 1862 for the Confederate States Navy. The vessel was built in Birkenhead on the River Mersey opposite Liverpool, England, by John Laird Sons and Company. Launched as &quot;Enrica&quot;, she was fitted out as a cruiser and commissioned as CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; on August 24, 1862. Under Captain Raphael Semmes, &quot;Alabama&quot; served as a successful commerce raider, attacking, capturing, and burning Union merchant and naval ships in the North Atlantic, as well as intercepting American grain ships bound for Europe. The Alabama continued through the West Indies and further into the East Indies, destroying over seven ships before returning to Europe. On June 11, 1864, the &quot;Alabama&quot; arrived at Cherbourg, France, where she was overhauled. Shortly after, a Union sloop-of-war, , arrived; and on June 19, the Battle of Cherbourg commenced outside the port of Cherbourg, France, whereby the &quot;Kearsarge&quot; sank the Alabama in approximately one hour after the Alabama&#x27;s opening shot.

==History==

===Construction===
&quot;Alabama&quot; was built in secrecy in 1862 by British shipbuilders John Laird Sons and Company, in north-west England at their shipyards at Birkenhead, Wirral, opposite Liverpool. The construction was arranged by the Confederate agent Commander James Bulloch, who led the procurement of sorely needed ships for the fledgling Confederate States Navy. The contract was arranged through the Fraser Trenholm Company, a cotton broker in Liverpool with ties to the Confederacy. Under prevailing British neutrality law, it was possible to build a ship designed as an armed vessel, provided that it was not actually armed until after it was in international waters. In light of this loophole, &quot;Alabama&quot; was built with reinforced decks for cannon emplacements, ammunition magazines below water level, etc., but was not fitted with armaments or any &quot;warlike equipment&quot; originally.

Initially known only by her shipyard number &quot;ship number 0290&quot;, she was launched as &quot;Enrica&quot; on 15 May 1862 and secretly slipped out of Birkenhead on 29 July 1862. U.S. Navy Commander Tunis A. M. Craven, commander of , was in Southampton and was tasked with intercepting the new ship, but was unsuccessful. Agent Bulloch arranged for a civilian crew and captain to sail &quot;Enrica&quot; to Terceira Island in the Azores. With Bulloch at his side, the new ship&#x27;s captain, Raphael Semmes, left Liverpool on 13 August 1862 aboard the steamer &quot;Bahama&quot; to take command of the new cruiser. Semmes arrived at Terceira Island on 20 August 1862 and began overseeing the refitting of the new vessel with various provisions, including armaments, and 350 tons of coal, brought there by &quot;Agrippina&quot;, his new ship&#x27;s supply vessel. After three days&#x27; work by the three ships&#x27; crews, &quot;Enrica&quot; was equipped as a naval cruiser, designated a commerce raider, for the Confederate States of America. Following her commissioning as CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;, Bulloch then returned to Liverpool to continue his secret work for the Confederate Navy.

&quot;Alabama&quot;″s British-made ordnance consisted of six muzzle-loading, broadside, 32-pounder naval smoothbores (three firing to port and three firing to starboard) and two larger and more powerful pivot cannons. The pivot cannons were placed fore and aft of the main mast and positioned roughly amidships along the deck&#x27;s center line. From those positions, they could be rotated to fire across the port or starboard sides of the cruiser. The fore pivot cannon was a heavy, long-range 100-pounder, 7-inch-bore (178 mm) Blakely rifled muzzleloader; the aft pivot cannon a large, 8-inch (203 mm) smoothbore.

The new Confederate cruiser was powered by both sail and by a two-cylinder John Laird Sons and Company horizontal steam engine, driving a single, Griffiths-type, twin-bladed brass screw. (Note: At the time a cylinder was also called an engine. Therefore, the machinery involved, which had two cylinders, could also be referred to as a pair of engines, which description is often found in sources.)

The telescopic funnel could be raised or lowered by chains to disguise the fact that the vessel was a steamer.

With the screw retracted using the stern&#x27;s brass lifting gear mechanism, &quot;Alabama&quot; could make up to ten knots under sail alone and when her sail and steam power were used together.

===Commissioning and voyage===
The ship was purposely commissioned about a mile off Terceira Island in international waters on 24 August 1862. All the men from &quot;Agrippina&quot; and &quot;Bahama&quot; had been transferred to the quarterdeck of &quot;Enrica&quot;, where her 24 officers, some of them Southerners, stood in full dress uniform. Captain Raphael Semmes mounted a gun-carriage and read his commission from President Jefferson Davis, authorizing him to take command of the new cruiser. Upon completion of the reading, musicians assembled from among the three ships&#x27; crews began to play the tune &quot;Dixie&quot; as the quartermaster finished hauling down &quot;Enrica&quot;″s British colors. A signal cannon was fired and the ship&#x27;s new battle ensign and commissioning pennant were broken out at the peaks of the mizzen gaff and mainmast. With that the cruiser became the Confederate States Steamer &quot;Alabama&quot;. The ship&#x27;s motto: &quot;Aide-toi et Dieu t&#x27;aidera&quot; (French which approximately translates as &quot;God helps those who help themselves&quot;) was engraved in the bronze of the great double ship&#x27;s wheel.

Captain Semmes then made a speech about the Southern cause to the assembled seamen (few of whom were American), asking them to sign on for a voyage of unknown length and destiny. Semmes had only his 24 officers and no crew to man his new command. When this did not succeed, he offered signing money and double wages, paid in gold, and additional prize money to be paid by the Confederate congress for all destroyed Union ships. The men began to shout &quot;Hear! Hear!&quot; in response. 83 seamen, many of them British, signed on for service in the Confederate Navy. Bulloch and the remaining seamen then boarded their respective ships for the return to England. Semmes still needed another 20 or so men for a full complement, but there were enough to at least handle the new commerce raider. The rest would be recruited from the captured crews of raided ships or from friendly ports-of-call. Many of the 83 crewmen who signed on completed the full voyage.


Under Captain Semmes, &quot;Alabama&quot; spent her first two months in the Eastern Atlantic, ranging southwest of the Azores and then redoubling east, capturing and burning northern merchant ships. After a difficult Atlantic crossing, she continued her cruise in the greater New England region. She then sailed south, arriving in the West Indies, where she raised more havoc before finally cruising west into the Gulf of Mexico. There, in January 1863, &quot;Alabama&quot; had her first military engagement. She came upon and quickly sank the Union side-wheeler just off the Texas coast, near Galveston, capturing that warship&#x27;s crew. She then continued further south, eventually crossing the Equator, where she took the most prizes of her raiding career while cruising off the coast of Brazil.

After a second, easterly Atlantic crossing, &quot;Alabama&quot; sailed down the southwestern African coast where she continued the campaign against northern commerce. After stopping in Saldanha Bay on 29 July 1863 in order to verify that no enemy ships were in Table Bay, she finally made a much-needed refitting and reprovisioning visit to Cape Town, South Africa. &quot;Alabama&quot; is the subject of an Afrikaans folk song, &quot;Daar kom die Alibama&quot; still popular in South Africa today. She then sailed for the East Indies where she spent six months, destroying seven more ships before finally returning via the Cape of Good Hope en route to France. Union warships hunted frequently for the Confederate raider, but on the few occasions &quot;Alabama&quot; was spotted, she eluded her pursuers by vanishing over the horizon.

All together, she burned 65 Union vessels of various types, most of them merchant ships. During all of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s raiding ventures, captured ships&#x27; crews and passengers were never harmed, only detained until they could be placed aboard a neutral ship or placed ashore in a friendly or neutral port. 

===Expeditionary raids===

All together, &quot;Alabama&quot; conducted a total of seven expeditionary raids, spanning the globe, before heading to France for refit and repairs:

* CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;″s Eastern Atlantic Expeditionary Raid (August–September 1862) commenced immediately after commissioning. She set sail for the shipping lanes southwest and then east of the Azores, where she captured and burned ten prizes, mostly whalers.
* CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;″s New England Expeditionary Raid (October–November 1862) began after Captain Semmes and his crew departed for the northeastern seaboard of North America, along Newfoundland and New England, where she ranged as far south as Bermuda and the coast of Virginia, burning ten prizes while capturing and releasing three others.
* CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;″s Gulf of Mexico Expeditionary Raid (December 1862 – January 1863) began as &quot;Alabama&quot; effected a needed rendezvous with her supply vessel, CSS &quot;Agrippina&quot;. Afterward, she rendered aid to Confederate land forces during the Battle of Galveston in coastal Texas, by sinking the Union side-wheeler .
* CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;″s South Atlantic Expeditionary Raid (February–July 1863) was her most successful raiding venture, taking 29 prizes while raiding off the coast of Brazil. Here she recommissioned the bark &quot;Conrad&quot; as .
* CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;″s South African Expeditionary Raid (August–September 1863) occurred primarily while ranging off the coast of South Africa, as she worked together with CSS &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;.
* CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;″s Indian Ocean Expeditionary Raid (September–November 1863) involved a journey of nearly 4,500 miles (7,250 km) across the Indian Ocean. Successfully evading the Union gunboat &quot;Wyoming&quot;, she took three prizes near the Sunda Strait and the Java Sea.
* CSS &quot;Alabama&quot;″s South Pacific Expeditionary Raid (December 1863) was her final raiding venture. She took a few prizes in the Strait of Malacca before finally turning back toward France for refit and repair.

Upon the completion of her seven expeditionary raids, &quot;Alabama&quot; had been at sea for 534 days out of 657, never visiting a Confederate port. She boarded nearly 450 vessels, captured or burned 65 Union merchant ships, and took more than 2,000 prisoners without any loss of life among either prisoners or her own crew.

===Final cruise===

On 11 June 1864, &quot;Alabama&quot; arrived in port at Cherbourg, France. Captain Semmes soon requested permission to dry dock and overhaul his ship, necessary after naval action and so long at sea. Pursuing the raider, the American sloop-of-war, , under the command of Captain John Ancrum Winslow, arrived three days later and took up station just outside the harbor. While at his previous , Winslow had telegraphed Gibraltar to send the old sloop-of-war with provisions and to provide blockading assistance. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; now had &quot;Alabama&quot; boxed in with no place left to run.

Up to this point, Semmes had faced another warship only once - the much less well armed blockade ship &quot;Hatteras&quot;. The &quot;Kearsarge&quot; was not clearly superior to &quot;Alabama&quot;, and Semmes did not wish his ship to be interned by the French. Therefore, after preparing his ship and drilling the crew for the coming battle during the next several days, Semmes issued, through diplomatic channels, a challenge to the &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s commander, &quot;my intention is to fight the &quot;Kearsarge&quot; as soon as I can make the necessary arrangements. I hope these will not detain me more than until to-morrow or the morrow morning at farthest. I beg she will not depart until I am ready to go out. I have the honor to be Your obedient servant, R. Semmes, Captain.&quot;

On 19 June, &quot;Alabama&quot; sailed out to meet the Union cruiser. Jurist Tom Bingham later wrote, &quot;The ensuing battle was witnessed by Édouard Manet, who went out to paint it, and the owner of an English yacht who had offered his children a choice between watching the battle and going to church.&quot;

As &quot;Kearsarge&quot; turned to meet her opponent, &quot;Alabama&quot; opened fire. &quot;Kearsarge&quot; waited until the range had closed to less than 1,000 yards (900 m). According to combatants, the two ships steamed on opposite courses in seven spiraling circles, moving southwesterly with the 3-knot current, each commander trying to cross the bow of his opponent to deliver a heavy raking fire (to &quot;cross the T&quot;). The battle quickly turned against &quot;Alabama&quot; due to the superior gunnery displayed by &quot;Kearsarge&quot; and the deteriorated state of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s contaminated powder and fuses. Her most telling shot, fired from the forward 7-inch (178 mm) Blakely pivot rifle, hit very near &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s vulnerable stern post, the impact binding the ship&#x27;s rudder badly. That rifled shell, however, failed to explode. If it had done so, it would have seriously disabled &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s steering, possibly sinking the warship, and ending the contest. In addition, &quot;Alabama&quot;″s too rapid rate-of-fire resulted in poor gunnery, with many of her shots going too high, and as a result &quot;Kearsarge&quot;&#x27;s outboard chain armor received little damage. Semmes later said that he did not know about &quot;Kearsarge&quot;&#x27;s armor at the time of his decision to issue the challenge to fight, and in the following years firmly maintained he would have never fought &quot;Kearsarge&quot; if he had known.

&quot;Kearsarge&#x27;s&quot; hull armor had been installed in just three days, more than a year before, while she was in port at the Azores. It was made using of single link iron chain and covered hull spaces long by deep. It was stopped up and down to eye-bolts with marlines and secured by iron dogs. Her chain armor was concealed behind 1-inch deal-boards painted black to match the upper hull&#x27;s color. This &quot;chaincladding&quot; was placed along &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s port and starboard midsection down to the waterline, for additional protection of her engine and boilers when the upper portion of her coal bunkers were empty (coal bunkers played an important part in the protection of early steam vessels, such as protected cruisers).

A hit to her engine or boilers could easily have left &quot;Kearsarge&quot; dead in the water, or even caused a boiler explosion or fire that could destroy the cruiser. Her armor belt was struck twice during the fight. The first hit, by one of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s 32-pounder shells, was in the starboard gangway, cutting the chain armor and damaging the hull planking underneath. A second 32-pounder shell exploded and broke a link of the chain armor, tearing away a portion of the deal-board covering. Had those rounds come from &quot;Alabama&quot;″s more powerful 100-pounder Blakely pivot rifle, they would have easily penetrated, but the likely result would not have been very serious, as both shots struck the hull a little more than five feet above the waterline. Even if both shots had penetrated &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s side, they would have missed her vital machinery. However, a 100-pound shell could have done a great deal of damage to her interior; hot fragments could have easily set fire to the cruiser, one of the greatest risks aboard a wooden vessel.
A little more than an hour after the first shot was fired, &quot;Alabama&quot; was reduced to a sinking wreck by &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s powerful Dahlgrens, forcing Captain Semmes to strike his colors and to send one of his two surviving boats to &quot;Kearsarge&quot; to ask for assistance.

According to witnesses, &quot;Alabama&quot; fired about 370 rounds at her adversary, averaging one round per minute per gun, a fast rate of fire compared to &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s gun crews, who fired less than half that number, taking more careful aim. In the confusion of battle, five more rounds were fired at &quot;Alabama&quot; after her colors were struck. (Her gun ports had been left open and the broadside cannon were still run out, appearing to threaten &quot;Kearsarge&quot;.) A hand-held white flag at &quot;Alabama&quot;″s stern spanker boom finally halted the engagement.

Prior to this, she had her steering gear damaged by shell hits, but the fatal shot came later when one of &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s shells tore open a mid-section of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s starboard waterline. Water quickly rushed through the hull, eventually flooding the boilers and taking her down by the stern to the bottom. As &quot;Alabama&quot; sank, the injured Semmes threw his sword into the sea, depriving &quot;Kearsarge&quot;″s commander, Winslow, of the traditional surrender of the sword (an act which was seen as dishonorable by many at the time).

Of her 170 crew, the &quot;Alabama&quot; had 19 fatalities (9 killed and 10 drowned) and 21 wounded &quot;Kearsarge&quot; rescued most of the survivors, but 41 of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s officers and crew, including Semmes, were rescued by John Lancaster&#x27;s private British steam yacht &quot;Deerhound&quot;, while &quot;Kearsarge&quot; stood off to recover her rescue boats as &quot;Alabama&quot; sank. Captain Winslow had to stand by and watch &quot;Deerhound&quot; spirit his adversary away to England. Semmes and the 41 crew members successfully reached England. Semmes eventually returned to the Confederacy and became a Confederate admiral in the last weeks of the war.

The sinking of &quot;Alabama&quot; by &quot;Kearsarge&quot; is honored by the United States Navy with a battle star on the Civil War campaign streamer.

==Officers==

: Died in Saldanha Bay from accidental gunshot on 3 August 1863.
: Drowned in the sinking of the &quot;Alabama&quot; 19 June 1864.
: Lt of CS Marines. Brother-in-law of CS President Jefferson Davis
: Drowned in the sinking of the &quot;Alabama&quot; 19 June 1864.
: Killed in action in the sinking of the &quot;Alabama&quot; 19 June 1864

Dr. David Herbert Llewellyn, a Briton and the ship&#x27;s assistant surgeon, tended the wounded during the battle. At one point the operating table was shot away. He worked in the wardroom until the order to abandon ship was finally given. As he helped wounded men into &quot;Alabama&quot;″s only two functional lifeboats, an able-bodied sailor attempted to enter one, which was already full. Llewellyn, understanding that the man risked capsizing the craft, grabbed and pulled him back, saying &quot;See, I want to save my life as much as you do; but let the wounded men be saved first.&quot;

An officer in the boat, seeing that Llewellyn was about to be left aboard the stricken &quot;Alabama&quot;, shouted &quot;Doctor, we can make room for you.&quot; Llewellyn shook his head and replied, &quot;I will not peril the wounded.&quot; Unknown to the crew, Llewellyn had never learned to swim, and he drowned when the ship went down.

His sacrifice did not go unrecognized in England. In his native village, a memorial window and tablet were placed at Easton Royal Church. Another tablet was placed in Charing Cross Hospital, London, where he attended medical school.

==Repercussions==
During her two-year career as a commerce raider, &quot;Alabama&quot; damaged Union merchant shipping around the world. The Confederate cruiser claimed 65 prizes valued at nearly $6,000,000 (about $ in today&#x27;s dollars); in 1862 alone 28 were claimed. In an important development in international law, the U.S. government pursued the &quot;&quot;Alabama&quot; Claims&quot; against the United Kingdom for the losses caused by &quot;Alabama&quot; and other raiders fitted out there. A joint arbitration commission awarded the U.S. $15.5 million in damages.

Ironically, in 1851, a decade before the Civil War, Captain Semmes had observed:

However, she and other raiders failed in their primary purpose, which was to draw Union vessels away from the blockade of the southern coastline that was slowly strangling the Confederacy. The Confederate government had hoped that panicking shipping companies would force the Union to dispatch ships to protect merchant shipping and hunt down the raiders, a task which always requires a proportionately greater force when compared with the numbers of ships attacking (see Battle of the Atlantic). Union officials proved immovable on the blockade, however, and although insurance prices soared, shipping costs went up, and many vessels transferred to a neutral flag, very few naval vessels were taken off the southern blockade. In fact, with clever use of resources and a mammoth shipbuilding program, the Union managed to steadily increase the blockade throughout the war. It also sent vessels to protect merchant shipping and to hunt and destroy the few Confederate raiders and privateers still operating.

===The wreck===
In November 1984 the French Navy mine hunter &quot;Circé&quot; discovered a wreck under nearly 200 ft (60 m) of water off Cherbourg at . Captain Max Guerout later confirmed the wreck to be &quot;Alabama&quot;″s remains.

In 1988 a non-profit organization, the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; Association, was founded to conduct scientific exploration of the shipwreck. Although the wreck is in French territorial waters, the United States Government, as the successor to the former Confederate States of America, is the owner. On 3 October 1989 the US and France signed an agreement recognizing this wreck as an important heritage resource of both nations and establishing a Joint French-American Scientific Committee for archaeological exploration. This agreement established a precedent for international cooperation in archaeological research and in the protection of a unique historic shipwreck.

The Association CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and the Naval History and Heritage Command signed on 23 March 1995 an official agreement accrediting Association CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; as operator of the archaeological investigation of the remains of the ship. The association, which is funded solely from private donations, is continuing to make this an international project through its fundraising in France and in the US, thanks to its sister organization, the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; Association, incorporated in the State of Delaware.

&quot;Alabama&quot; was fitted with eight pieces of ordnance after she arrived at the Azores; six of those were 32-pounder smooth bores. Seven cannon were identified at the wreck site: Two were cast from a Royal Navy pattern and three were of a later pattern produced by Fawcett, Preston, and Company in Liverpool.

One of the Blakely pattern 32-pounders was found lying across the starboard side of the hull, forward of the boilers. A second Blakely 32-pounder was identified outside the hull structure, immediately forward of the propeller and its lifting frame; the forward 32-pounder was recovered in 2000. Both of the Royal Navy pattern 32-pounders were identified: One lies inside the starboard hull, forward of the boilers, adjacent to the forward Downton pump. The second was identified as lying on the iron deck structure, immediately aft of the smoke pipe; it was recovered in 2001. The sole remaining 32-pounder has not been positively identified, but it could be underneath hull debris forward of the starboard Trotman anchor.

&quot;Alabama&quot;″s heavy ordnance were one Blakely Patent 7-inch 100-pounder shell rifle mounted on a pivot carriage forward and one 68-pounder smoothbore similarly mounted aft. The Blakely 7-inch 100-pounder was found beside its pivot carriage, atop the forward starboard boiler; this was the first cannon recovered from &quot;Alabama&quot;. The 68-pounder smoothbore was located aft, at the stern, immediately outside the starboard hull structure; it is possible that the remains of its truck and pivot carriage lie underneath the gun barrel. Both heavy cannon were recovered in 1994.

In addition to the seven cannon, the wreck site contained shot, gun truck wheels, and brass tracks for the gun carriages; many of the brass tracks were recovered. Two shot were recovered, and one conical projectile was inside the barrel of the 7-inch Blakely rifle. A shell for a 32-pounder was recovered from the stern, forward of the propeller; that shot was attached to a wood sabot having been packed in a wood box for storage. Additional round shot were observed scattered forward of the boilers and in the vicinity of the aft pivot gun, one possibly having been fired from &quot;Kearsarge&quot;.

In 2002, a diving expedition raised the ship&#x27;s bell along with more than 300 other artifacts, including more cannons, structural samples, tableware, ornate commodes, and numerous other items that reveal much about life aboard the Confederate warship. Many of the artifacts are now housed in the Underwater Archaeology Branch, Naval History &amp; Heritage Command conservation lab.

==Folklore and heritage==

&quot;Alabama&quot; is the subject of a sea shanty, &quot;Roll, Alabama, Roll&quot; which was also the basis of a 2014 record of the same name by British contemporary folk band Bellowhead.

&quot;Alabama&quot;″s visit to Cape Town in 1863 has passed (with a slight spelling change) into South African folklore in the Afrikaans song, &quot;Daar Kom die Alibama&quot;.

The Alabama Hills in Inyo County, California, are named after the vessel.

==Claimed Links between the CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and Captain Nemo’s fictional submarine the &quot;Nautilus&quot;==

In 1998 the Jules Verne scholar William Butcher was the first to identify a possible link between the Birkenhead-built &quot;Alabama&quot; and Captain Nemo’s &quot;Nautilus&quot; from the Jules Verne 1869 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas.&quot; Butcher stated &quot;The Alabama, which claimed to have sunk 75 merchantmen, was destroyed by the Unionist Kearsarge off Cherbourg on 11th June 1864…. This battle has clear connections with Nemo’s final attack, also in the English Channel.&quot;

Jules Verne had himself made a previous comparison between the Birkenhead-built CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; and the &quot;Nautilus&quot; in a letter to his publisher Jules Hetzel in March 1869. Other arguments in favor of a connection were made by Birkenhead born geography teacher John Lamb.

==Battle ensigns and other naval flags==

Both the United States Navy and the Confederate States Navy flew an ensign and a jack (primary and secondary naval flags) following British naval tradition that originated in the 17th century. The fledgling Confederate Navy therefore adopted and used jacks, commissioning pennants, battle ensigns, small boat ensigns, designating flags, and signal flags aboard its warships during the Civil War.

===Surviving flags===

At the beginning of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s raiding ventures, the newly commissioned cruiser may have been forced, out of necessity, to fly the only battle ensign available to Captain Semmes: an early 1861, 7-star First National Flag, possibly the same battle ensign flown aboard his previous command, the smaller commerce raider CSS &quot;Sumter&quot;. Between 21 May and 28 November 1861, six more Southern states seceded and joined the Confederacy. Well before &quot;Alabama&quot; was launched as &quot;Enrica&quot; at Birkenhead, Merseyside in North West England, six more white, 5-pointed stars had been added to the &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; far away across the Atlantic on the Confederate mainland.

One such early &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; battle ensign was salvaged from &quot;Alabama&quot;″s floating debris, following her sinking by &quot;Kearsarge&quot;. It still survives and is held by the Alabama Department of Archives and History. It is listed there as &quot;Auxiliary Flag of the C.S.S. Alabama, Catalogue No. 86.3766.1.&quot; According to their provenance reconstruction, DeCost Smith, an American from New England, discovered this &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; ensign in a Paris upholstery shop in 1884, where he purchased it for 15 francs. Smith&#x27;s nephew, Clement Sawtell of Lincoln Square, Massachusetts, later inherited the ensign from his uncle. At the suggestion of retired Rear Admiral Beverly M. Coleman, Sawtell donated it to the State of Alabama on 3 June 1975.

This battle ensign&#x27;s overall dimensions are different from the Confederate flag regulations&#x27; required 2:3 ratio. It is 64-inches high (hoist) by 112-inches long (fly), a proportion of 5:9, and its dark blue canton contains &quot;eight&quot; white stars, 8-inches (203 mm) high, in an unusual arrangement: The stars are not organized in a circle but configured in three, centered, horizontal rows of two, then three, and finally two. The additional 8th star is tucked into the lower left corner (and in the lower right corner on the opposite side), giving the canton&#x27;s layout a unique, asymmetrical appearance. It seems plausible this was &quot;Alabama&quot;″s original 7-star battle ensign, possibly flown aboard CSS &quot;Sumter&quot; as noted earlier, and later altered at some point when the long-delayed news of an 8th state joining the Confederacy finally reached the far distant cruiser.

Two &quot;Star and Bars&quot; battle ensigns, labeled as having belonged to &quot;Alabama&quot;, also still exist. The first is a mounted and framed, &quot;14-star&quot; ensign located at the Mariner&#x27;s Museum in Virginia. (A small number of these unusual 14-star national flags have survived to the modern era and are held in several Civil War archives.) From the several color photo available on the Internet, this ensign appears to have an approximate hoist-to-fly aspect ratio of 1:2.5 (i.e., very rectangular). A second &quot;Stars and Bars&quot; battle ensign is on display at the Pensacola Historical Museum. Its canton contains a circle of 12 stars surrounding a centered, larger 13th star.

===Surviving stainless banners===

Four of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s later-style ensigns have survived to the modern era. The first measures and is located in South Africa at Cape Town&#x27;s Bo-Kaap Museum. Its &quot;Southern Cross&quot; canton is oversize and made after the British navy fashion: Instead of being square, it has a very rectangular 1:2 aspect ratio. It was also made without any white stripes outlining its diagonal blue bars. A central 5-pointed white star, located where the two blue saltires&#x27; cross, is larger than the other twelve. This ensign appears to have been made by her British crew sometime between &quot;Alabama&quot;″s two visits to Cape Town. This flown ensign was finally given in thanks to William Anderson, whose ship&#x27;s chandler company helped make repairs and provide supplies to &quot;Alabama&quot; in Cape Town, shortly before the raider returned to Cherbourg, France (and her fateful battle with the sloop-of-war, USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot;).

A second Stainless Banner ensign of South African origin was made and then presented to &quot;Alabama&quot; on one of her two port visits to Cape Town; it resides in the Tennessee State Museum, according to their website.

The third surviving Stainless Banner is one of &quot;Alabama&quot;″s original small boat ensigns. This official-looking ensign is marked in brown pigment on its hoist: &quot;Alabama. 290. C.S.N. 1st Cutter.&quot; In 2007 it was offered and sold through Philip Weiss Auctions. It was being sold by the grandson of its second owner, who had originally purchased it from the granddaughter of a USS &quot;Kearsarge&quot; sailor. Its buyer has since resold this small boat ensign through a later auction.

A fourth surviving ensign appears, from various clues observed in on-line photos, to be roughly . Because &quot;Alabama&quot; was forced to replace several of her original small boats lost at different times during her lengthy cruise, this is likely a larger replacement boat ensign. While it could have been made aboard, its somewhat more accurate details suggest it might have been commissioned ashore during a port-of-call visit. This ensign was rescued from the sinking &quot;Alabama&quot; by W. P. Brooks, the cruiser&#x27;s assistant-engineer. It was last flown, along with other historic flags, during a ceremony held on the parade ground at Fort Pulaski, GA, sometime during 1937. This ensign has since been mounted and framed and continues to reside with the Brooks family; four modern photos of it can be found at the website for the &quot;Alabama Crew,&quot; a British-based naval reenactor group.

The Alabama Department of Archives and History has in its collection one more important Stainless Banner ensign listed as &quot;Admiral Semmes&#x27; Flag, Catalogue No. 86.1893.1 (PN10149-10150)&quot;. Their provenance reconstruction shows that it was presented to Semmes after the sinking of &quot;Alabama&quot; by &quot;Lady Dehogton and other English ladies&quot;. Such presentations of ceremonial colors were uncommon to ships&#x27; captains of the Confederate Navy, but a few were known to have received such honors. This Second National Flag is huge and made of pure silk, giving it an elegant appearance. While this ensign is in a remarkable state of preservation, its large size and delicate condition have made its up-close details and measurements unavailable. When Semmes returned to the Confederacy from England, he brought this ceremonial Stainless Banner with him. It was inherited by his grandchildren, Raphael Semmes III and Mrs. Eunice Semmes Thorington. Following his sister&#x27;s death, Raphael Semmes III donated the ensign to the state of Alabama on 19 September 1929.

<text>Leibniz University Hannover (), also known as the University of Hannover, is a public research university located in Hanover, Germany. Founded on 2 May 1831 as Higher Vocational School, the university has undergone six periods of renaming, its most recent in 2006.

Leibniz University Hannover is a member of TU9, an association of the nine leading Institutes of Technology in Germany. It is also a member of the Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research, a non-profit association of leading engineering universities in Europe. The university sponsors the German National Library of Science and Technology, the largest science and technology library in the world.

== History ==

The roots of the university begin in the Higher Vocational College/Polytechnic Institute (), founded on 2 May 1831. In 1879 the Higher Vocational School moved into the historic Guelph palace (), which was specially converted for the purpose. 

On 1 April 1879, the Higher Vocational School became the Royal College of Technology (). In 1899 Kaiser Wilhelm II granted the College of Technology a status equal to that of universities and the right to confer doctorates. The college was reconstructed in 1921 with the financial support of the College Patrons&#x27; Association. As of 1 July 1922, there were three faculties: Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering.

In 1968 the Faculty of Humanities and Political Science were founded and the (&#x27;Technical College&#x27; or &#x27;Technical University&#x27;) became the (&#x27;Technical University Hannover&#x27;). 

Between 1973 and 1980 the faculties of Law, Business and Economics, and the formerly independent Teachers Training College were added to the university and in 1978 the was renamed (&#x27;University of Hannover&#x27;). Student numbers exceeded 30,000 for the first time in 1991. 

On the 175th anniversary of the institution in 2006, the &#x27;University of Hannover&#x27; was given the name , or for short. While 64 students first attended the Vocational School, today the university has around 27,200 students, more than 3,400 academics and scientists, and 160 departments and institutes.

== Namesake ==

The Senate of the university voted in April 2006 to rename the University of Hannover to . Following agreement by the Leibniz Academy on the use of the name, the received its name on the 360th anniversary of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz&#x27;s birth. The brand of the university is .

The old logo of the university was inspired by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The current logo, adopted in 2008, is a stylised excerpt from a letter to Duke Rudolf August of Wolfenbüttel, in which Leibniz presented binary numbers for the first time.

== Faculties and staff ==

The library was established on the founding of the in 1831. It expanded into an important collection as the institution evolved from a vocational/technical college into the full University. The removal of the books into storage during the Second World War secured valuable old stocks that became a unique national collection of scientific and technical literature in postwar Germany. This was the basis on which the library of the Institute of Technology () was established in 1959. Today the collection forms the heart of the German National Library of Science and Technology, which is the largest institution of its kind in the world.

<doc id="535857" wikidata="Q5968585" url="?curid=535857" title="IBM 1440">
<text>The IBM 1440 computer was announced by IBM October 11, 1962. This member of the IBM 1400 series was described many years later as &quot;essentially a lower-cost version of the 1401&quot;, and programs for the 1440 could easily be adapted to run on the IBM 1401.

Despite what IBM described as &quot;special features ... to meet immediate data processing requirements and ... to absorb increased demands,&quot; the 1440 did not quite attain the same commercial success as the 1401, and it was withdrawn on February 8, 1971.

Author Emerson Pugh wrote that the 1440 &quot;did poorly in the marketplace because it was initially offered without the ability to attach magnetic tape units as well.&quot; (referring to offering both tape and disk).

==System configuration==

The IBM 1441 processing unit (CPU) contained arithmetic and logic circuits and up to 16,000 alphanumeric storage positions.
The console was either a Model 1 or, when an electric typewriter was added, a Model 2, of the IBM 1447 operator&#x27;s console.
==Peripherals==
The following peripherals were available:
* IBM 1442 card reader/punch
** Model 1 read up to 300 cards a minute and punched up to 80 columns a second
** Model 2 read up to 400 cards a minute and punched up to 160 columns a second
** Model 4, a read-only unit, read up to 400 cards/minute.
An IBM 1440 could be configured with a choice of:
::Model 4 (lowest cost)
::Model 4, for reading, and a Model 1 or 2 as a second unit

* IBM 1443 flying typebar printer
** Basic rate of 150 lines a minute and up to 430 lines a minute, depending on typebar
** Interchangeable typebars having character sets of 13, 39, 52, and 63 characters

* IBM 1311 disk drive
** Capacity for 2 million characters in each removable pack
*** With optional &quot;Move Track Record&quot; feature, capacity is increased to 2,980,000 characters in each pack
** Each pack weighed less than 10 lb (5 kg).
** Up to five 1311 drives
* Tape drives
** The IBM 7335 tape drive, available for use with the 1440, was introduced by IBM on October 10, 1963.

==Software==

IBM 1440 Autocoder was the assembly language provided by IBM. An IOCS was also provided, as was a collection of &quot;Disk File Organization Routines&quot;.

==Pricing==
The cost and rental rate were:
* Purchase price: $90,000 and up, depending on system configuration.
* Rental rate: $1,500 and up, monthly rental, depending on system configuration.

==Installations==
Notable installations included a high-end 1440 at the Chicago Police Department installed by reformist superintendent Orlando Winfield Wilson in the early 1960s.

In the 1960s, Polish ZOWAR (ZETO Warszawa) was officially the first customer for IBM in Poland after WWII, despite the Iron Curtain.

In 2012, the TechWorks! Prototype Workshop of the Center for Technology &amp; Innovation (CT&amp;I) in Binghamton, New York successfully resurrected a 1440 system including a CPU and console, a 1311 disk drive, and a 1442 card reader/punch.

An example of a more fully configured 1440 was:
* five disk drives
* two magnetic tape drives
* two card reader-punches
* one high-speed printer
* an optical reader (to transfer specially coded medical data forms to magnetic tape)

<text>Roque Gastón Máspoli Arbelvide (12 October 1917 in Montevideo – 22 February 2004 in Montevideo) was a Uruguayan football player and coach. He was the goalkeeper for the Uruguay national team that won the 1950 World Cup. He was also the head coach for the Uruguayan team that won the 1980 Mundialito.

==Career==
Born in Montevideo, into a Ticinese family originally from Caslano, Maspoli began playing in the youth ranks of Club Nacional de Football. He would make his Uruguayan Primera División debut with Liverpool de Montevideo in 1939.

After one season with Liverpool, he joined C.A. Peñarol. He would spend the rest of his playing career with Peñarol, winning six Primera titles with the club.

In the final match of the 1950 World Cup, known as the &quot;Maracanazo&quot; due to Uruguay&#x27;s surprising win at the Maracanã stadium in Rio de Janeiro, in front of near 200,000 Brazilian fans, Máspoli allowed one goal as the visitors beat favorites Brazil 2–1.

Máspoli also coached Uruguayan club Peñarol, with which he won five national championships, the Copa Libertadores and the 1966 Intercontinental Cup, when the team beat Real Madrid 4–0 on aggregate. Later, he managed teams in Spain, Peru and Ecuador.

In the 1980s, Máspoli spent several years coaching the Uruguay national team. He took charge again in 1997, becoming the oldest ever manager of any national football team at the age of 80.

Roque Máspoli was hospitalized on 10 February 2004 with heart trouble. He died twelve days later at the age of 86. His remains are buried at Cementerio del Buceo, Montevideo.

<text>Camping World Stadium is an outdoor stadium in Orlando, Florida, United States located in the West Lakes neighborhood of Downtown Orlando, west of new sports and entertainment facilities including the Kia Center, the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, and Inter&amp;Co Stadium. It opened in 1936 as Orlando Stadium and has also been known as the Tangerine Bowl and Florida Citrus Bowl. The City of Orlando owns and operates the stadium.

Camping World Stadium is the current home venue of the Citrus Bowl and the Pop-Tarts Bowl. It is also the regular host of other college football games including the Florida Classic between Florida A&amp;M and Bethune-Cookman, the MEAC/SWAC Challenge, and the Camping World Kickoff. The stadium was built for football and in the past, it has served as the home of numerous minor/alternate-league football clubs, including teams from the WFL, USFL, WLAF, XFL, UFL, and most recently the Orlando Guardians of the 2020 XFL. From 2011 to 2013, it was the home of the Orlando City SC, a soccer team in USL Pro, then it was a temporary home for Orlando City of the MLS while Inter&amp;Co Stadium was under construction.

From 1979 to 2006, the stadium served as the home of the UCF Knights football team. It was one of the nine venues used for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and also hosted 1996 Olympic soccer matches. The stadium has hosted the NFL&#x27;s Pro Bowl five times.

==Stadium history==
Construction on the stadium began in 1936 as a project of the Works Progress Administration under President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. The stadium was built to the immediate east of the baseball park Tinker Field, which opened in 1914. The stadium opened later in 1936 with a capacity of 8,900 as Orlando Stadium. The first college football bowl game was played on January 1, 1947. Catawba defeated Maryville 31–6 in the inaugural Tangerine Bowl. 2,000 seats were added in 1952. During this period, the stadium was known as the Tangerine Bowl. 5,000 more seats were added in 1968, along with the first press box.

From 1974 to 1976 an expansion project raised the capacity to 50,612, including a 3,600-seat upper deck on the east sidelines. However, shortly after completion the project proved to be a public fiasco and potentially an architectural and engineering failure. On November 27, 1976, the first major game was held at the expanded stadium, a regular season matchup between Florida and Miami. During the game, the newly constructed upper deck noticeably swayed whenever fans stood up and cheered. The deck vibrated, fences and railings shook and creaked, causing an unnerving sensation for the patrons sitting in those sections. The swaying and shaking was noticeable again about a month later during the 1976 Tangerine Bowl game. The swaying was so pronounced that some fans vowed never to sit in those seats again, while some refused to return to the stadium at all. Before long, engineering evaluations, as well as legal investigations, uncovered numerous missteps, rushing, and cut corners in the stadium&#x27;s design. While it was believed that the upper deck was structurally sound and met building codes, it nevertheless was deemed a failure. Additional problems included inadequate access to restrooms in the upper deck, gaps between the sections which required obstructive fences, and the fact that the upper deck was built at such an angle that it had poor sight lines. Meanwhile, unsightly I-beams installed to hold up the upper deck now blocked seats in the lower deck that were previously unobstructed.

The maligned stadium&#x27;s reputation was heavily tarnished after the upper deck scandal, criticized by public officials, media, and fans. Further complicating the situation was UCF&#x27;s pending move to the stadium for 1979. The city finally received a settlement of $900,500 from the stadium&#x27;s engineers, architects, and designers, money that was soon appropriated for new improvements. The infamous steel east upper deck was dismantled in May 1980.

After various new improvements, and a $30 million renovation that added new concrete upper decks to both sides, a capacity of 65,438 was established in 1989. In 1983, the Florida Department of Citrus was added as a title sponsor for the facility, at a price of $250,000. From 1999 to 2002, key stadium improvements included the addition of contour seating, two escalators, and a new wide scoreboard/video screen. A new sound system, along with two full-color ribbon displays along the upper decks, were also added. The expansion resulted in the upper deck overhanging Tinker Field&#x27;s right field area, albeit at a significant height.

==Events hosted==
===Football===
====Professional football====
Camping World Stadium has been home field to several short-lived professional football teams. From 1966 to 1970, the stadium was home to the Orlando Panthers of the Continental Football League. In 1974, the Florida Blazers of the World Football League played their only season in existence at the Tangerine Bowl. The USFL&#x27;s Orlando Renegades played one season in 1985. The Orlando Thunder of the WLAF called the Citrus Bowl home in their two-season existence during the early 1990s, while the XFL&#x27;s Orlando Rage played there in 2001 as well as the UFL&#x27;s Florida Tuskers, occupying the stadium for 2 seasons from 2009, before moving to Virginia Beach as the Virginia Destroyers in 2011. The Orlando Fantasy of the Lingerie Football League moved to the stadium shortly after, having previously used the UCF Arena.

In 2022, it was announced that Orlando had been chosen to be the home of one of the third incarnation of the XFL’s eight teams and that the team would play its home games at Camping World Stadium. The Orlando Guardians played in the 2023 XFL season before folding after the XFL&#x27;s merger with the USFL.

The stadium hosted the NFL&#x27;s all-star game, the Pro Bowl, from 2017 through 2020. In 2024, the event returned for a fifth time under the new title Pro Bowl Games. It was the first time since the NFL transitioned the event to a new format of skills competitions and non-contact Flag football. Seven NFL preseason games have been held at the stadium.

====College football====
The stadium has hosted various college football games, including many bowl games:

* Since 1947 (except for 1973), the stadium has hosted a bowl game, currently known as the Citrus Bowl, typically played on January 1 or January 2. The bowl has also been known by different names, and has also been held during December, at various times during its history.
** The December 1958 edition of the game, then known as the Tangerine Bowl, was notable for the segregation policy of the stadium operators, the Orlando High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), leading to the University at Buffalo declining their bowl bid, as their two black players would not have been allowed to play.
* Since 1997, the stadium has been home to the Florida Classic, an annual game between Bethune–Cookman University and Florida A&amp;M University.
* Since 2001, the stadium has hosted a December bowl game, which has undergone several name changes due to sponsorship changes—, it is known as the Pop-Tarts Bowl.
* In 2010 and 2011, the stadium hosted the East–West Shrine Game, which then moved to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida.
* The stadium has hosted the Cure Bowl, a December bowl game, during 2015–2018 and in 2020. The bowl was announced to return in 2024.
* The stadium hosted the 1979 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game, 2005 C-USA Championship Game, and 2016 ACC Championship Game.
* Rollins College of Winter Park, Florida, was the first college to use the then-named Orlando Stadium as its home field. It played there prior to and after World War II.

====High school football====
The Florida High School Athletic Association state football championships are held at Camping World Stadium.
The varsity football team from nearby Jones High School used Camping World Stadium as a regular season home field for decades through the end of their 2011 season. The school started playing home football games on their own field beginning on August 31, 2012.

===Soccer===
The playing surface is large enough for use in international soccer matches, and it was a venue for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. In five matches, attendance averaged over 60,000 per match. In 1996, Olympic soccer matches in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions were held at the stadium.

It hosted the USISL A-League Orlando Sundogs in 1997. It also hosted the Major League Soccer All-Star Game in 1998. The stadium was the home of Orlando City SC, a soccer team in the USL Pro League. In 2013, the investment group that owned that club was awarded an expansion team in Major League Soccer. They spent their 2014 season in USL Pro at ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Lake Buena Vista while Camping World Stadium was being renovated.

During the 2013 season, Fifth Third Bank owned naming rights to the field for Orlando City matches. Its name during those matches was Fifth Third Bank Field at the Citrus Bowl.

Orlando City played their final USL Pro match at Camping World Stadium on September 6, 2013. They won the USL Pro Championship over Charlotte Eagles, 7–4, before a crowd of 20,886. The last soccer event held at Camping World Stadium before its renovation was an international friendly between the women&#x27;s teams of the United States and Brazil. The U.S. won the match, 4–1, before a crowd of 20,274.

Orlando City, now playing in Major League Soccer, returned to Camping World Stadium for the 2015 and 2016 seasons.

The Orlando Pride, the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League 2016 expansion team owned by Orlando City SC, played in Camping World Stadium while the Orlando City (now Exploria) Stadium was completed.

Camping World Stadium was one of the venues for Copa América Centenario in June 2016. Three group stage matches were held there, Paraguay vs Costa Rica on June 4, Bolivia vs Panama on June 6 and Brazil vs Haiti on June 8.

The stadium hosted the Mexico national football team vs. Guatemala &quot;MexTour&quot; on April 27, 2022.

The 2022 Florida Cup exhibition soccer match between Arsenal and Chelsea, 4–0, had an attendance of 63,811, a record crowd for a soccer match at the stadium.

The stadium will be one of twelve venues to host the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

===WrestleMania===

On March 30, 2008, the stadium hosted WrestleMania XXIV, the 2008 edition of WWE&#x27;s flagship professional wrestling pay-per-view. The first WrestleMania held in Florida, and the second to be held entirely outdoors since WrestleMania IX at Caesars Palace, it had a reported attendance of 74,635—the largest crowd in stadium history. It was estimated to have brought in $51.5 million in revenue to the local economy.

WWE returned to Camping World Stadium to host WrestleMania 33, which took place on April 2, 2017. WWE claimed an attendance record of 75,245, exceeding the total of WrestleMania XXIV.

==Renovations==

By 2005, Orlando-area government officials and officials from the University of Central Florida (UCF) expressed dissatisfaction with the state of the facility and lack of revenue, as while UCF was the primary leasing tenant for the facility, it received minimal revenue from football games. Lack of an agreement to rectify these issues led UCF to consider relocating, or spend considerable expense to upgrade the facility at its own cost. In addition, the stadium&#x27;s capacity was seen as too large for UCF, leaving the stadium an appearance of being empty even with attendance of as much as 30,000–40,000 people per game. UCF&#x27;s all-time attendance record was 51,978 for the 2005 C-USA Championship Game versus Tulsa. Furthermore, the stadium was located over from the university&#x27;s main campus in East Orlando, with travel times of up to a half-hour due to traffic. In 2005, UCF officials led by university president John Hitt made the decision to construct a new on-campus stadium, which opened for the 2007 season.

Orlando officials began exploring stadium refurbishment project in 2004, when the Capital One Bowl bid to become a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game, but was not chosen due to the stadium&#x27;s aging condition. Camping World Stadium also submitted a bid for the ACC Championship Game, but lost to Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. The key reasons for losing the bids were the lack of modern luxury boxes, bench seating, and capacity. The hopes for Camping World Stadium became reality when, on September 29, 2006, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer announced an agreement on a $175-million renovation of Camping World Stadium. It is part of the &quot;Triple Crown for Downtown&quot;, a $1.1-billion plan to redo the Orlando Centroplex with a new $480-million arena for the Orlando Magic, a new $375-million performing arts center, and the Camping World Stadium improvements. Conceptual drawings for the possible improvements include enclosed concourses on the east and west sides of the stadium and additions to the north side that will finally complete the lower bowl. The Orlando/Orange County Interlocal Agreement was approved by the Orlando City Council on August 6, 2007. However, the plans were heavily affected by the Great Recession of 2007–08.

In 2010, the natural grass surface was replaced with AstroTurf Gameday Grass 3D after the 2009 Champs Sports Bowl and 2010 Capital One Bowl were marred by poor field conditions that led to two football player injuries. Stadium conditions once again prompted a review of the stadiums condition. Finally, it was announced in May 2013 that the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium would undergo a reconstruction during 2014, at a cost of less than US$200 million. The cost estimate as of March 2014 was US$207 million. The stadium&#x27;s upper-level seating was retained, but the entire lower bowl structure was demolished.

In the newly reconstructed stadium there are two 360-degree concourses, a plaza deck (&quot;Party Deck&quot;) in the north end zone, 41,000 all-new lower bowl seats with six additional inches of leg room &amp; chairbacks, multiple giant video displays, new team facilities including locker rooms training rooms and attached media, new stadium operations facilities to allow better efficiency in food service, security, first aid and maintenance, new concessions and restrooms, and an open-air façade. The new mezzanine is now referred to as the &quot;Plaza level&quot;. The upper deck, previously numbered the &quot;300&quot; level, is now numbered the &quot;200&quot; level.

The reconstruction began immediately following a groundbreaking event held at the stadium on January 29, 2014, and demolition of the entire lower bowl lasted 25 days. The first event at the renovated Camping World Stadium was the 2014 edition of the Florida Classic on November 22, 2014. The Bethune-Cookman Wildcats defeated the Florida A&amp;M Rattlers, 18–17 in overtime.

Orlando City returned to the renovated Camping World Stadium for the 2015 season, their first season in Major League Soccer, while awaiting construction of their own soccer-specific stadium. In their first match, a 1–1 draw against fellow expansion team New York City FC on March 8, 2015, they drew a sellout crowd of 62,510, the largest attendance for a soccer match at the venue.

The United States women&#x27;s national soccer team returned to Camping World Stadium on October 25, 2015. They defeated Brazil again, 3–1. The attendance of 32,869 was the largest attendance for a standalone USWNT friendly in the state of Florida.

The Orlando Pride, the expansion National Women&#x27;s Soccer League team owned by Orlando City SC, played in Camping World Stadium until the Orlando City Stadium was complete. On April 23, 2016, they broke the record for attendance at an NWSL game, setting at 23,403, when the Pride beat the Houston Dash, 3–1.

On November 19, 2015, CONCACAF and CONMEBOL announced that Camping World Stadium would be one of the host venues for the Copa América Centenario soccer tournament in 2016.

On April 26, 2016, Florida Citrus Sports announced that they had sold naming rights for the stadium to Camping World. Camping World also became the title sponsor of the stadium&#x27;s college football kickoff game through at least 2019, and the annual December bowl game held at the stadium was known as the Camping World Bowl from 2017 through 2019. These naming changes did not affect the Citrus Bowl or the Florida Classic.

In 2021, Camping World Stadium renovations included modernizing and improving the north endzone seating bowl, concession areas, club-level seating, and new premium mezzanine clubs on east and west. The project was completed on a fast-track schedule of less than 12 months by Construction Manager Barton Malow. During the work, the City of Orlando and Florida Citrus Sports hosted several events at the stadium. All were held without incident due to specialized safety techniques that separated construction activities, visitors, and staff.

Florida Citrus Sports released plans for a new renovation on November 14, 2023. Plans included demolition of the upper decks built in the 1980s, and replacing them with a new set of upper decks on the east, west, and south sides of the stadium, integrated with the lower bowl in a 360-degree concourse. The new upper decks would total 18,000 seats. The plans also included a 100,000-square-foot fieldhouse. The Orange County Board of County Commissioners approved $400 million in tourist development tax revenue for use in the renovation on January 23, 2024.

===Seating and attendance===
Prior to the 2014 renovation, the stadium had 65,000 permanent seats. The lower bowl lacked permanent seats in the north end zone, though temporary bleachers could be erected there if necessary. The temporary bleachers were last used for the 2005 Capital One Bowl, which had an attendance of 70,229.

Following the renovation, the seating capacity was reduced to 60,219 due to the introduction of chair-back seats in the lower bowl and Plaza Level. The upper deck continues to have bench seats. Temporary bleachers can be added in the Plaza level in place of the Party Deck to increase the capacity to 65,194.

==In popular culture==
*Camping World Stadium (then still known as the Citrus Bowl) was a filming location for the 1998 Adam Sandler movie &quot;The Waterboy&quot;. In the film, the Citrus Bowl depicted both the home stadium of the fictional University of Louisiana Cougars as well as the venue of the climactic Bourbon Bowl game.
*Exterior shots of the then-Citrus Bowl were used in the television series &quot;Coach&quot;, starring Craig T. Nelson as Coach Hayden Fox. In the show, the Citrus Bowl was the home stadium of the fictional Orlando Breakers franchise, which Coach Fox led during the series&#x27; final two seasons (1995–1997). The change, which coincided with a production move to Disney-MGM Studios (now Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios), reflected the real-life expansion team, the Jacksonville Jaguars.

<doc id="535861" wikidata="Q471029" url="?curid=535861" title="The Regulators (novel)">
<text>The Regulators is a novel by American author Stephen King, writing under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. It was published in 1996 at the same time as its &quot;mirror&quot; novel, &quot;Desperation&quot;. The two novels represent parallel universes relative to one another, and most of the characters present in one novel&#x27;s world also exist in the other novel&#x27;s reality, albeit in different circumstances. Additionally, the US hardcover first editions of each novel, if set side by side, make a complete painting, and on the back of each cover is also a peek at the opposite&#x27;s cover. 

King had previously &quot;killed off&quot; Bachman after the pseudonym was publicly exposed around the time of the 1984 release of the Bachman novel &quot;Thinner&quot;. However, on the book&#x27;s jacket and in a tongue-in-cheek introduction by the book&#x27;s editor, it was alleged that this 1996 work was written by Bachman years earlier, but the manuscript had only recently been discovered by his widow in a trunk. The novel began as a screenplay titled &quot;The Shotgunners&quot;. King says that film writer-director Sam Peckinpah read the script and made some suggestions, but Peckinpah died while King was writing the second draft.

== Plot ==
Along a residential street in the suburban town of Wentworth, Ohio, a paperboy is suddenly shot by a mysterious stranger in a red van. The neighborhood’s panicked civilians run for shelter while author Johnny Marinville attempts to contact the police. However, an otherworldly force prevents the call from going through. Two other colorful vans, each driven by mysterious and odd strangers, later appear and kill three more residents. Former police officer Collie Entragian directs the affected residents and corrals them into the homes of victim David Carver and veterinarian Tom Billingsley. Only two residents remain indoors the entire time, seemingly unfazed: Audrey Wyler and her autistic nephew Seth, whom she has been caring for since the death of his family two years ago, remain silent among the chaos.

During a trip to a mining town in Desperation, Nevada, an evil, otherworldly being named Tak took possession of Seth&#x27;s body after it was released from a mine. Implementing strong mental influence, it later killed Seth’s parents and siblings. Tak then forced Audrey&#x27;s husband to commit suicide. To survive, Audrey took refuge in a mental construct of her creation, modeling her safe place after a favorite retreat. Seth, meanwhile, is sent into the deep recesses of his mind while Tak is in control and suffers poor hygiene and nutrition as a result of the creature’s neglect. Because of his autism, Seth displays a gifted mental strength that is likely the reason Tak was drawn to him in the first place. It also helps keep his mind intact while Tak is in control. Tak is the source of the vans, which are derived from the cartoon &quot;MotoKops 2200&quot;, which Seth watches religiously. Seth also often watches a Western movie named &quot;The Regulators&quot;, and Tak eventually transforms the neighborhood into an Old West landscape with no way to escape, as some of the residents soon find.

After several other people are killed in various ways (including Collie, after being mistakenly shot by a neighborhood teenager named Jim Reed, who then committed impulse suicide), Seth makes time for Audrey to escape the house while Tak is preoccupied. After Audrey puts a laxative in Seth&#x27;s milk, she takes the chance to go across the street to the Carver&#x27;s home and explain the situation to the others. Seth ingests the laxative which causes Tak to leave Seth&#x27;s body temporarily as it cannot stand witnessing the boy defecate. She slips back to the house with Johnny to try to rescue Seth before Tak returns, but Cammie Reed follows, with a gun. Distraught over the death of her son, Jim, earlier, Cammie kills Seth, and mortally wounds Audrey as Tak tries to re-enter the boy’s body. Tak’s attention is then diverted to her and it enters Cammie’s body instead. However, she cannot hold up to Tak the way that Seth could and her body is destroyed as a result of the possession. Tak leaves her in the form of smoke and dissipates in the wind. The vans disappear and the landscape is returned to its normal state. A short epilogue in the form of a letter reveals that Seth’s and Audrey’s spirits have taken up residence at the meadow from Audrey’s mental sanctuary, and live there happily in what is implied to be an alternate parallel paradise.

==Connections and adaptations ==
In the novel&#x27;s epilogue, a letter written by a woman on her honeymoon to her friend mentions one of King&#x27;s earlier works, &quot;The Shining&quot;. As a mirror novel, characters from &quot;Desperation&quot; appear, though in different roles and, in some cases, different physical appearances. In August 2014, King mentioned that there had been discussions about turning &quot;The Regulators&quot; into a TV series, but no other mention was made thereafter. In August 2022, it was announced that Bohemia Group had optioned the rights to the novel for an adaptation and tapped George Cowan to write the script with Justin Ross as producer, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Cowan.

<doc id="535865" wikidata="Q846957" url="?curid=535865" title="Desmosome">
<text>A desmosome (; ), also known as a macula adherens (plural: maculae adherentes) (Latin for &quot;adhering spot&quot;), is a cell structure specialized for cell-to-cell adhesion. A type of junctional complex, they are localized spot-like adhesions randomly arranged on the lateral sides of plasma membranes. Desmosomes are one of the stronger cell-to-cell adhesion types and are found in tissue that experience intense mechanical stress, such as cardiac muscle tissue, bladder tissue, gastrointestinal mucosa, and epithelia.

==Structure==
Desmosomes are composed of desmosome-intermediate filament complexes (DIFCs), a network of cadherin proteins, linker proteins and intermediate filaments. The DIFCs can be broken into three regions: the extracellular core region (&quot;desmoglea&quot;), the outer dense plaque (ODP), and the inner dense plaque (IDP).

The extracellular core region, approximately 34 nm in length, contains desmoglein and desmocollin, which are in the cadherin family of cell adhesion proteins. Both have five extracellular domains, and have calcium-binding motifs. Extracellular calcium helps form the cadherin adhesion by allowing the cadherin extracellular domain on desmoglein and desmocollin to become rigid. They bind to each other via heterophilic interactions in the extracellular space near their N-termini, in contrast with the homophilic binding characteristic of other cadherins. Desmoglein and desmocollin have a single pass transmembrane region plus an intracellular anchor to secure its position in the cell membrane. Desmogleins and the desmocollin isoform &quot;Dsc-a&quot; contain an intracellular cadherin domain, which binds to plakoglobin.

The outer dense plaque, which is about 15–20 nm in length, contains the intracellular ends of desmocollin and desmoglein, the N-terminus side of desmoplakin, and the armadillo family of mediatory proteins plakoglobin and plakophilin. Armadillo proteins are involved in mediating attachment to intracellular filaments and cell membrane proteins. Armadillo proteins consist of β-catenin, p120-catenin, plakoglobin (γ-catenin), and plakophilins 1-3. In desmosomes, plakoglobin and plakophilin help to anchor desmoplakin and keratin filaments to the desmosome structure. Plakoglobin has 12-arm repeats with a head and tail structure. Plakophilins have 9-arm repeats, and exist in two isoforms: a shorter &quot;a&quot; form and longer &quot;b&quot; form.

The inner dense plaque, also about 15–20 nm in length, contains the C-terminus end of desmoplakin and their attachment to keratin intermediate filaments. Desmoplakin is the most abundant part of the desmosome, as it operates as the mediator between the cadherin proteins in the plasma membrane and the keratin filaments. Desmoplakin has two isoforms that differ in the length of their middle rod domain. All desmoplakins have an N-terminal head, a C-tail consisting of three plakin repeats, and a glycine-serine-arginine rich domain (GSR) at the C-end.

==Clinical significance==

=== Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy ===
Mutations within the desmosome are the main cause of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), a life-threatening disease caused by mutations usually in desmoglein 2, but sometimes in desmocollin 2. It often afflicts individuals between 20 and 50 years, and has been publicly known as a cause of death in young athletes, although the majority of sudden deaths do not occur in close connection to physical activity. The current incidence within the population is accepted as 1/10,000; however, it is thought that 1/200 may have a mutation that may predispose to ACM. Symptoms of ACM include fainting, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations and the condition is treated by implanting a small defibrillator device.

=== Blisters ===
Blistering diseases such as pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) are autoimmune diseases in which auto-antibodies target desmogleins. PV is caused by circulating autoantibodies (IgG) that target Dsg3 (Desmoglein 3) and sometimes Dsg1. PV is manifested by suprabasal acantholysis, or blisters in the mucous membrane and blisters in the epidermis. PF patients have autoantibodies that target Dsg1 with superficial blisters on the epidermis with no mucous membrane issues. Both disease result in a loss of keratinocyte adhesion. Pemphigus can also be caused by a bacterial infection: bullous impetigo is an infection caused by a staphylococcus bacterium that releases a toxin that cleaves the Dsg1 extracellular domain.

Similar symptoms occur with Hailey–Hailey disease, though the cause is not autoimmune but genetic. A haploinsufficiency of the ATP2C1 gene located on chromosome 3, which encodes the protein hSPCA1, causes malformation of the desmosomes. Desmoglein 1 haploinsufficiency leads to striate palmoplantar keratoderma, a disease which causes extreme thickening of the epidermis. Loss of desmoglein 4 leads to defective hair-follicle differentiation.

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is an epidermal blistering disease caused by mutations in genes coding for keratin 5 and 14, which attach to desmoplakin. This disease manifests as rupture of the basal epidermis when stress is applied. Ectodermal dysplasia or skin fragility syndrome is caused by plakophilin 1 mutations. This is manifested by detachment of intermediate filaments and desmoplakin from the desmosome.

==History==
The desmosome was first discovered by Giulio Bizzozero, an Italian pathologist. He named these &quot;dense nodules&quot; the &quot;nodes of Bizzozero&quot;. In 1920, the term &quot;desmosome&quot; was originated by Josef Schaffer. The first combining form, &quot;&quot;, Neo-Latin from Greek &quot;desmos&quot;, bond, carries meaning of binding or bonding things together. Combined with &quot;&quot;, which comes from &quot;soma&quot;, body, it thus makes a desmosome a &quot;binding body&quot;.

<text>An ( ) is a kind of &quot;yōkai&quot;, demon, orc, ogre, or troll in Japanese folklore. They are believed to live in caves or deep in the mountains. Oni are known for their superhuman strength and have been associated with powers like thunder and lightning, along with their evil nature manifesting in their propensity for murder and cannibalism. They are typically portrayed as hulking figures with one or more horns growing out of their heads, massive teeth, and occasionally a third eye in the center of the forehead. They are typically depicted with red, blue, black, or yellow colored skin, wearing loincloths of tiger pelt, and carrying iron kanabō clubs. They also have three to six digits on each hand and foot tipped with claw-like nails. Oni are able to change their looks to fool their victims into trusting them. Oni can be male or female, but have been predominantly male throughout history. Female oni are sometimes referred to by the name Yamauba. When in disguise, oni are capable of appearing as a man or woman, regardless of their gender. As monstrous as oni are, they have been linked to bringing good fortune and wealth.

During the Heian period (794–1185), were often depicted in Japanese literature, such as , as terrifying monsters that ate people. A prominent depiction of is that they eat people in one mouthful, which is called &quot;&quot;. In , and , for example, a woman is shown being eaten in one mouthful by a . There is the theory that the reason why stories of were common is that wars, disasters, and famines where people lose their lives or go missing were interpreted as from another world appearing in the present world who take away humans.

It was not until the legend of was created that the began to be depicted in paintings, and the 14th century is the oldest surviving depicting . &quot;Shuten-dōji&quot; has been regarded as the most famous and strongest &quot;oni&quot; in Japan. The legend of &quot;Shuten-dōji&quot; has been described since the 14th century in various arts, traditional performing arts and literature such as &quot;emakimono&quot;, &quot;jōruri&quot;, &quot;noh&quot;, &quot;kabuki&quot;, &quot;bunraku,&quot; and &quot;ukiyo-e&quot;. The &quot;tachi&quot; (Japanese long sword) &quot;Dōjigiri&quot; with which Minamoto no Yorimitsu decapitated &quot;Shuten-dōji&quot;&#x27; in the legend is now designated as a National Treasure and one of the &quot;Tenka-Goken&quot; (Five Greatest Swords Under Heaven).

They are popular characters in Japanese art, literature, and theater and appear as stock villains in the well-known fairytales of &quot;Momotarō&quot; (&quot;Peach Boy&quot;), &quot;Issun-bōshi&quot;, and &quot;Kobutori Jīsan.&quot; Although oni have been described as frightening creatures, they have become tamer in modern culture as people tell less frightening stories about them like &quot;Oni Mask&quot; and &quot;Red Oni Who Cried&quot;.

==Etymology, change of meaning==

, written in as 鬼, is read in China as &quot;guǐ&quot; , meaning something invisible, formless, or unworldly, in other words, a &#x27;ghost&#x27; or the &#x27;soul of the dead&#x27;. On the other hand, the Japanese dictionary written in Japan in the 10th century explained the origin of the word as a corruption of , meaning &#x27;to hide&#x27;. The dictionary explained that is hidden and does not want to reveal itself. When the character for 鬼 was first introduced to Japan, it was pronounced as in the reading.

The character 鬼 has changed over time in Japan to become its own entity, and there are significant differences between the Japanese and the Chinese &quot;guǐ&quot; (鬼). The Chinese &quot;guǐ&quot; generally refers to the disembodied spirits of the dead and are not necessarily evil. They usually reside in the underworld, but those with a grudge sometimes appear in the human world to haunt, and Taoist priests and others have used their supernatural powers to exterminate them. Japanese , on the other hand, are evil beings that have substance, live in certain places in the human world, such as mountains, have red or blue bodies with horns and fangs, are armed with , and can be physically killed by cutting with Japanese swords.

The and are the earliest written examples of as entities rather than soul of the dead. The , whose compilation began in 713, tells the story of a one-eyed who ate a man. , completed in 720, tells of a -wearing watching the funeral of Emperor Saimei from the top of Mount Asakura. The character for 鬼 is believed to have been read as when the was completed, and was also read as , , and in the Heian period. In , the character for 鬼 is read as . It was not until the end of the Heian period that the reading of for the character 鬼 became almost universal.

Particularly powerful oni may be described as &quot;kishin&quot; or &quot;kijin&quot; (literally &quot;oni god&quot;; the &quot;ki&quot; is an alternate character reading of &quot;oni&quot;), a term used in Japanese Buddhism to refer to Wrathful Deities.

The &quot;oni&quot; was syncretized with Hindu-Buddhist creatures such as the man-devouring &quot;yaksha&quot; and the &quot;rakshasa&quot;, and became the &quot;oni&quot; who tormented sinners as wardens of Hell (Jigoku), administering sentences passed down by Hell&#x27;s magistrate, King Yama (Enma Daiō). The hungry ghosts called &quot;gaki&quot; (餓鬼) have also been sometimes considered a type of &quot;oni&quot; (the Kanji for &quot;ki&quot; 鬼 is also read &quot;oni&quot;). Accordingly, a wicked soul beyond rehabilitation transforms into an &quot;oni&quot; after death. Only the very worst people turn into &quot;oni&quot; while alive, and these are the &quot;oni&quot; causing troubles among humans as presented in folk tales.

Some scholars have even argued that the &quot;oni&quot; was entirely a concept of Buddhist mythology.

Oni bring calamities to the land, bringing about war, plague/illness, earthquakes, and eclipses. They have the destructive power of lightning and thunder, which terrifies people through their auditory and visual effects.

==Origins==

Most Japanese folklore come from the Kojiki (古事記, &quot;Records of Ancient Matters&quot; or &quot;An Account of Ancient Matters&quot;) and Nihongi (日本紀, &quot;Japanese Chronicles&quot;). These stories are the history and development of Japan in ancient times. At the beginning of time and space, Takamagahara (高天原, &quot;Plane of High Heaven&quot; or &quot;High Plane of Heaven&quot;) came into being, along with the three divine beings Amenominakanushi (天之御中主, The Central Master or &quot;Lord of the August Center of Heaven&quot;), Takamimusubi (高御産巣日神, &quot;High Creator&quot;), and Kamimusubi (神産巣日, The Divine Creator). These three divine beings were known as Kami, and the three together are sometimes referred to as Kotoamatsukami (別天神, literally &quot;distinguishing heavenly kami&quot;). They manifested the entire universe. They were later joined by two more Kami, Umashiashikabihikoji (宇摩志阿斯訶備比古遅神, Energy) and Amenotokotachi (天之常立神, Heaven).

Finally, two lesser Kami were made to establish earth, Izanagi (イザナギ/伊邪那岐/伊弉諾, meaning &quot;He-who-invites&quot; or the &quot;Male-who-invites&quot;) and Izanami (イザナミ, meaning &quot;She-who-invites&quot; or the &quot;Female-who-invites&quot;). These two were brother and sister. They also are married and had many children, one of them being Kagutsuchi (カグツチ, Fire). Upon birth, Kagutsuchi mortally wounded Izanami, who went to Yomi (黄泉, 黄泉の国, World of Darkness) on her death and was transformed into a Kami of death. Izanami, who gave life in the physical world, continued to do so in the underworld, ultimately creating the very first oni.

==Demon gate==

According to Chinese Taoism and esoteric Onmyōdō, the ways of yin and yang, the northeasterly direction is termed the &quot;kimon&quot; (鬼門, &quot;demon gate&quot;) and considered an unlucky direction through which evil spirits passed. Based on the assignment of the twelve zodiac animals to the cardinal directions, the &quot;kimon&quot; was also known as the &quot;ushitora&quot; (丑寅), or &quot;Ox Tiger&quot; direction. One hypothesis is that the &quot;oni&quot;″s bovine horns and tiger-skin loincloth developed as a visual depiction of this term.

Temples are often built facing that direction, for example, Enryaku-ji was deliberately built on Mount Hiei which was in the &quot;kimon&quot; (northeasterly) direction from Kyoto in order to guard the capital, and similarly Kan&#x27;ei-ji was built towards that direction from Edo Castle.

However, skeptics doubt this could have been the initial design of Enryaku-ji temple, since the temple was founded in 788, six years before Kyoto even existed as a capital, and if the ruling class were so feng shui-minded, the subsequent northeasterly move of the capital from Nagaoka-kyō to Kyoto would have certainly been taboo.

Japanese buildings may sometimes have L-shaped indentations at the northeast to ward against oni. For example, the walls surrounding the Kyoto Imperial Palace have notched corners in that direction.

==Traditional culture==
The traditional bean-throwing custom to drive out &quot;oni&quot; is practiced during Setsubun festival in February. It involves people casting roasted soybeans indoors or out of their homes and shouting , preferably by a strong wrestler. 

This custom began with the aristocratic and samurai classes in the Muromachi period (1336–1573). According to the &quot;Ainōshō&quot; (壒嚢鈔), a dictionary compiled in the Muromachi period, the origin of this custom is a legend from the 10th century during the reign of Emperor Uda. According to the legend, a monk on Mount Kurama threw roasted beans into the eyes of to make them flinch and flee. Another theory is that the origin of this custom lies in the word , which means bean. The explanation is that in Japanese, can also be written as , meaning the devil&#x27;s eye, or , meaning to destroy the devil. During the Edo period (1603–1867), the custom spread to Shinto shrines, Buddhist temples and the general public.

Regionally around Tottori Prefecture during this season, a charm made of holly leaves and dried sardine heads is used as a guard against oni.

There is also a well-known game in Japan called , which is the same as the game of tag that children in the Western world play. The player who is &quot;it&quot; is instead called the &quot;oni&quot;.

Oni are featured in Japanese children&#x27;s stories such as &quot;Momotarō&quot; (&quot;Peach Boy&quot;), &quot;Issun-bōshi&quot;, and &quot;Kobutori Jīsan&quot;.

==Modern times==

In more recent times, &quot;oni&quot; have lost some of their original wickedness and sometimes take on a more protective function. Men in oni costumes often lead Japanese parades to dispel any bad luck, for example.
Japanese buildings sometimes include oni-faced roof tiles called , which are thought to ward away bad luck, much like gargoyles in Western tradition.

Many Japanese idioms and proverbs also make reference to oni. For example, the expression (Translation: &quot;A child that does not resemble its parents is the child of an oni.&quot;) may be used by a parent to chastise a misbehaving child.

They can be used in stories to frighten children into obeying because of their grotesque appearance, savage demeanor, as well as how they can eat people in a single gulp.

== Stories ==

# Momotaro, the Peach Boy, is a well-known story about an elderly couple having the misfortune of never being able to conceive a child, but they find a giant peach that miraculously gives them a boy as their child. As the boy grows, he is made aware of an island of demons where the people are captured and, after their money is taken, kept as slaves and a source of food. Momotaro sets out to travel to the island with some cakes specially made for him, and while on his journey, he meets a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant who partner up with him to defeat the demons on the island, and once the demons have been taken out they recover the treasures and return them to the rightful owners. Momotaro and his companions, after accomplishing their goal, all return to their respective homes.
# Oni Mask is a story where a young girl goes off to work at a ladies&#x27; house to make money for her ailing mother. She talks to a mask of her mother&#x27;s face once she is done with her work to comfort herself. One day, the curious coworkers see the mask and decide to prank her by putting on an oni mask to replace the mother&#x27;s mask. Seeing the Oni mask, she takes it as a sign that her mother is worse and not getting better, so she leaves after alerting her boss. After trying to run to her mother&#x27;s side, she is sidetracked by some men gambling by a campfire. The men catch her and ignore her pleas to let her go to her mother and instead make her watch the fire so it does not go out during the game. While she is stoking the fire, she decides to put on the Oni mask to protect her from the flames. At that moment, the men see only a brightly lit Oni through the red glowing flames and, terrified, run away without gathering their money. The girl, after having made sure the fire would not go out, gathers the money, and waits for the men to return for it, but as time grows, she remembers she was going to see her mother and runs to her mother. While she is at home, she sees her mother is healthier than before, and because of the money the gamblers left behind, she has enough to take care of her without going back to work at the ladies&#x27; house.
# Red Oni Who Cried is a story of two oni, one red, the other blue. The red one wants to befriend humankind, but they are afraid of it, making the red oni cry. Knowing what the red oni wants, the blue oni devises a plan to make himself the villain by attacking the houses of the humans and allowing the red oni to save the humans from the blue oni, making the red oni a hero to the humans&#x27; eyes. After the humans see the red oni protect them from the blue oni, they determine that the red one is a good oni whom they would like to be friends with, which is what the red one wanted. Seeing this exchange, the blue oni decides to leave so as not to cause any misunderstanding with the humans. When the red oni decides to go home to his friend the blue oni, he notices that the blue oni is gone and realizes what the blue oni has done for him and cries from being touched by the blue oni&#x27;s thoughtfulness and wonderful friendship.

==In popular culture==

The oni remains a very popular motif in Japanese popular culture. Their varied modern depiction sometimes relies on just one or two distinctive features which mark a character as an oni, such as horns or a distinctive skin colour, although the character may otherwise appear human, lacking the oni&#x27;s traditionally fearsome or grotesque features. The context of oni in popular culture is similarly varied, with instances such as appearances in animated cartoons, video games and use as commercial mascots.
* The game series &quot;Touhou Project&quot; has several characters based on oni such as Suika Ibuki, who is also animated singing the popular song &quot;We Are Japanese Goblin&quot;, an example of modern popular culture depicting oni as far less menacing than in the past.
* In the manga &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; as well as its anime adaptation, oni are the administrative staff of the Spirit World. These oni are shown to be generally benevolent and good-natured, though not always bright. They are depicted in their traditional attire of animal furs and loincloths, resembling stereotypical cavemen. 
* The Unicode Emoji character U+1F479 (👹) represents an oni, under the name &quot;Japanese Ogre&quot;.
* The first-person shooter &quot;Overwatch&quot; has an oni-themed skin for its character Genji.
* In the Japanese role-playing horror game &quot;Ao Oni&quot;, the titular oni is depicted as a blue/purplish creature with a large head and human-like features. In the subsequent 2014 movie adaptation, the oni is given a radical makeover to appear more monstrous and scary, while in its 2016 anime adaptation, the oni remains faithful to its original appearance.
* The heavy metal band Trivium features an oni mask on their album cover for &quot;Silence in the Snow&quot;. The mask also appeared in the artwork for their single, &quot;Until the World Goes Cold&quot;, and in the music video for the song.

<text>A.T.B.A.N Klann &quot;(A Tribe Beyond a Nation)&quot; was an American hip hop group composed of Will 1X, apl.de.ap, Mooky Mook, and DJ Motiv8. The Atban Klann were signed to Eazy-E&#x27;s Ruthless Records. Will 1X (who later changed his stage name to will.i.am) and apl.de.ap were first signed by Eazy-E when they were in high school and would later become members of The Black Eyed Peas.

==History==

The group was signed to Ruthless Records in 1992 and debuted on Eazy-E&#x27;s EP, &quot;5150: Home 4 tha Sick&quot; on the track entitled &quot;Merry Muthaphuckkin&#x27; Xmas&quot;. Soon after, the group recorded their debut album, &quot;Grass Roots,&quot; which was to be released on October 6, 1994; however, the album was shelved shortly before its release, and shortly after being jailed for 6 weeks in early 1995 on a domestic assault charge, Mookie Mook would leave after an argument. The duo would stay with Ruthless until they were dropped from the label after Eazy-E died in 1995. Will 1X would change his name to will.i.am and the Atban Klann would add Taboo and later Fergie and become the Grammy award winning band, The Black Eyed Peas.

*1994: &quot;Puddles of H2O&quot;

==Studio album==
&quot;Grass Roots&quot; was originally planned for release at the end of 1993 for Ruthless Records, distributed by Relativity Records; however, the album was put on hold. In 1994, the group released the first single from the album, &quot;Puddles of H2O&quot;, as a CD single and promotional twelve-inch, with the B-side single &quot;Let Me Get Down&quot;. However, with the band being dropped from Ruthless in 1995 it was not released at that time. The songs from the album later leaked and a cover was made using a photo of apl.de.ap and will.i.am from the &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; photo-shoot in 2000. It was then remastered and released properly for the first time on vinyl in 2020 by Back 2 Da Source Records, which sold out.

<text>Daryn Jones(born January 3, 1978, in Victoria, British Columbia) is a Canadian comedian and radio and television personality.

==Career==
He began his career in stand-up comedy clubs at the age of 17, receiving formal training in a private training school.

He and fellow comedian Morgan &quot;Mista Mo&quot; Smith co-wrote and co-starred on the sketch comedy television show &quot;Buzz&quot; on the Toronto Community Access Channel in the mid-1990s. The show was picked up by the Canada-wide cable channel Comedy Network in 2000. In 2004, Jones was hired for the &quot;Rick Mercer Report&quot;, where he was a writer and an on-air correspondent. &quot;Buzz&quot; ended its run the next year.

In 1999, Jones co-hosted a morning show for contemporary hit radio station KISS 92 FM with Jay Michaels but left to focus on his television career after &quot;Buzz&quot; was picked up by The Comedy Network.

Jones made multiple appearances on CTV&#x27;s &quot;Open Mike with Mike Bullard&quot;. He hosted &quot;Laughing Matters&quot; and YTV&#x27;s flagship weekday afternoon programming block &quot;The Zone&quot; and has written for &quot;Oro Magazine&quot; and the &quot;National Post&quot;. Jones was a featured performer at the 2000 Canadian Comedy Awards, and received the 2001 Gemini Award for Best Writing in a Comedy Series for &quot;Buzz&quot;.

In 2006 he became the host of MTV Canada&#x27;s flagship series &quot;MTV Live&quot;, alongside co-hosts Nicole Holness, Paul &quot;The Intern&quot; Lemieux, and Sheena Snively. Jones has interviewed a variety of newsworthy guests including Dave Navarro, Mark Wahlberg, Brian Stever, The Cult, Tom Cruise, Feist, Tori Spelling, Nelly Furtado, Weird Al Yankovic, Trailer Park Boys, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Quentin Tarantino. He has appeared in commercials for Blockbuster Video and Arby&#x27;s. He also appeared in &quot;&quot; in the episode &quot;The Ghost In The Machine- Part 1&quot; as a guitar salesman. In 2010 he was a correspondent with CTV for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics. He also had a small part in &quot;Seventeen Again&quot; with Tia, Tamera and Tahj Mowry.

On May 4, 2012, he announced via Twitter that he would be leaving &quot;MTV Live&quot;. May 9 was Jones&#x27; last day on the program; the following day, he was announced as the host of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, a reality talent competition which aired on CBC Television in the 2012–13 season. Sometime after the conclusion of the show, Jones began to appear sporadically on Hockey Night in Canada for its 60th season. Not long after, Jones began appearing on Donut Showdown alongside Eden Grinshpan.

Jones returned to KISS 92.5 in 2018 and was the afternoon drive/early evening host.

In December 2023, he became the co-host of Virgin Radio Toronto&#x27;s morning drive show with Deepa Prashad.

<text>Altona (), also called Hamburg-Altona, is the westernmost urban borough (&quot;Bezirk&quot;) of the German city state of Hamburg. Located on the right bank of the Elbe river, Altona had a population of 270,263 in 2016.

From 1640 to 1864, Altona was under the administration of the Danish monarchy. Altona was an independent borough until 1937.

== History ==

=== Danish period ===
Altona was founded in 1535 as a village of fishermen in what was then Holstein-Pinneberg. In 1640, Altona came under Danish rule as part of Holstein-Glückstadt, and in 1664 was granted municipal rights by the Danish King Frederik III, who then ruled in personal union as Duke of Holstein. Altona was one of the Danish monarchy&#x27;s most important harbor towns. The railway from Altona to Kiel, the Hamburg-Altona–Kiel railway (), was opened in 1844.

=== Imperial period ===
The wars between Denmark and the German Confederation – the First Schleswig War (1848–1851) and the Second Schleswig War (February–October 1864) led to Denmark&#x27;s cession of the Duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg; they were initially jointly administered as a condominium by Prussian and Austrian administration. With the Gastein Convention of 14 August 1865, Holstein came under solely Austrian administration, while Schleswig and Lauenburg came under Prussian authority. After the Austro-Prussian War, Schleswig-Holstein as a whole became the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein in 1867 and as such Altona became part of the German Empire in 1871. In the same year, the town was hit by cholera, with a minimum of 16 casualties in Altona.

Because of severe restrictions on the number of Jews allowed to live in Hamburg until 1864 (with the exception of 1811–1815), a major Jewish community developed in Altona starting in 1611, when Count Ernest of Schaumburg and Holstein-Pinneberg granted the first permanent residence permits to Ashkenazic Jews. Members did business both in Hamburg and in Altona itself. All that remains after the Nazi Holocaust during World War II are the Jewish cemeteries, but in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, the community was a major center of Jewish life and scholarship. Holstein-Pinneberg and later Danish Holstein had lower taxes and placed fewer civil impositions on their Jewish community than did the government of Hamburg.

=== History from 1918 to 1945 ===
During the Weimar era following World War I, the town of Altona was disturbed by major labor strikes and street disorders. Inflation in Germany was a major problem. In 1923, Max Brauer, the mayor of Altona, directed that town personnel should be paid in part with gas meter tokens, as the tokens did not lose value from inflation. 

The most notable event at that time was the Altona Bloody Sunday (German: ) on 17 July 1932, when 18 people were killed, all but two by police, during a violent clash between Nazi marchers and members or supporters of the Communist Party. In 1938, the Greater Hamburg Act removed Altona from the Free State of Prussia in 1937 and merged it (and several surrounding towns) with the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. After police raids and a special court, on 1 August 1933, Bruno Tesch and others were found guilty and put to death by beheading with a hand-held axe.

=== Modern history ===
In the 1990s, the Federal Republic of Germany reversed the convictions of Tesch and the other men who were put to death, clearing their names.

On 1 February 2007, the &quot;Ortsämter&quot; (district offices) in Hamburg were done away with. In Altona, the districts of Blankenese, Lurup and Osdorf had existed and had local offices. On 1 March 2008, the Schanzenviertel neighborhood, which had spanned parts of the boroughs of Altona, Eimsbüttel and Hamburg-Mitte, became the Sternschanze quarter, the entirety of which is now in the Altona borough.

Altona is noted for being the site of the popular Altona Fischmarkt.

== Borough profile ==
Commentators and politicians, including former member of the Hamburg Parliament , have noted that neighborhoods in Altona is diverse in terms of social conditions. Von Berg noted that poverty present in the Lurup and Osdorf quarters contrast with the affluent Blankenese and Nienstedten quarters within the borough.

== Geography ==

To the east is the borough of Hamburg-Mitte and to the north is the borough of Eimsbüttel. The western border is with the state of Schleswig-Holstein.

<text>, Yamamba or Yamanba are variations on the name of a &quot;yōkai&quot; found in Japanese folklore.

==Description==
The word can also be written as 山母, 山姫, or 山女郎, and in the town of Masaeki, Nishimorokata District, Miyazaki Prefecture (now Ebino), a &quot;yamahime&quot; would wash her hair and sing in a lovely voice. Deep in the mountains of Shizuoka Prefecture, there is a tale that the &quot;yamahime&quot; would appear as a woman around twenty years of age and would have beautiful features, a small sleeve, and black hair, and that when a hunter encounters her and tries to shoot at it with a gun, she would repel the bullet with her hands. In Hokkaido, Shikoku, and the southern parts of Kyushu, there is also a yamajijii (mountain old man), and the yamauba would also appear together with a yamawaro (mountain child), and here the yamauba would be called &quot;yamahaha&quot; (mountain mother) and the yamajijii a &quot;yamachichi&quot; (mountain father). In Iwata District, Shizuoka Prefecture, the &quot;yamababa&quot; that would come and rest at a certain house was a gentle woman that wore clothes made of a tree&#x27;s bark. She borrowed a cauldron to boil some rice, but the cauldron would become full with just two go of rice. There wasn&#x27;t anything unusual about it, but it was said that when she sat to the side of it, the floor would creak. In Hachijō-jima, a &quot;dejji&quot; or &quot;decchi&quot; would perform kamikakushi by making people walk around places that should not exist for an entire night, but if one becomes friendly with her, she would lend you lintel, among other things. Sometimes she would also nurse children who go missing for three days. It is said that there are splotches on her body, and she has her breasts attached to her shoulders as if there was a tasuki cord. In the Kagawa Prefecture, yamauba within rivers are called &quot;kawajoro&quot; (river lady), and whenever a dike is about to break due to a great amount of water, she would say in a loud weeping voice, &quot;My house is going to be washed away.&quot; In Kumakiri, Haruno, Shūchi District, Shizuoka Prefecture (now Hamamatsu), there are legends of a yamauba called &quot;hocchopaa&quot;, and it would appear in mountain roads during the evening. Mysterious phenomena, such as the sounds of festivals and curses coming from the mountains, were considered to be because of this hocchopaa. In the Higashichikuma District, Nagano Prefecture, they are called &quot;uba&quot;, and the legends there tell of a yokai with long hair and one eye, and from its name, it is thought to be a kind of yamauba.

In the tales, the ones attacked by yamauba are typically travelers and merchants, such as ox-drivers, horse-drivers, coopers, and notions keepers, who often walk along mountain paths and encounter people in the mountains, so they are thought to be the ones who had spread such tales.

Yamauba have been portrayed in two different ways. There were tales where men stocking ox with fish for delivery encountered yamauba at capes and got chased by them, such as the &quot;Ushikata Yamauba&quot; and the &quot;Kuwazu Jobo&quot;, as well as a tale where someone who was chased by the yamauba would climb a chain appearing from the skies in order to flee, and when the yamauba tried to make chase by climbing the chain too, she fell to her death into a field of buckwheat, called the &quot;Tendo-san no Kin no Kusari&quot;. In these tales, the yamauba was a fearsome monster trying to eat humans. On the other hand, there were tales such as the &quot;Nukafuku Komefuku&quot; (also called &quot;Nukafuku Kurifukk&quot;), where two sisters out gathering fruit met a yamauba who gave treasure to the kind older sister (who was tormented by her stepmother) and gave misfortune to the ill-mannered younger sister. There is also the &quot;ubakawa&quot; tale, where a yamaba would give a human good fortune. In Aichi Prefecture, there is a legend that a house possessed by a yamauba would quickly gain wealth and fortune, and some families have deified them as protective gods.

==Appearance==
Depending on the text and translator, the Yamauba appears as a monstrous crone, &quot;her unkempt hair long and golden white ... her kimono filthy and tattered&quot;, with cannibalistic tendencies. In one tale a mother traveling to her village is forced to give birth in a mountain hut assisted by a seemingly kind old woman, only to discover, when it is too late, that the stranger is Yamauba, with plans to eat the helpless Kintarō. In another story, the yōkai raises the orphan hero Kintarō, who goes on to become the famous warrior Sakata no Kintoki.

Yamauba is said to have a mouth at the top of her head, hidden under her hair. In one story it is related that her only weakness is a certain flower containing her soul.


==Noh drama==

In one Noh drama, translated as, &quot;Yamauba, Dame of the Mountain,&quot; Konparu Zenchiku states the following:

:Yamauba is the fairy of the mountains, which have been under her care since the world began. She decks them with snow in winter, with blossoms in spring ... She has grown very old. Wild white hair hangs down her shoulders; her face is very thin. There was a courtesan of the Capital who made a dance representing the wanderings of Yamauba. It had such success that people called this courtesan Yamauba though her real name was Hyakuma.

The play takes place one evening as Hyakuma is traveling to visit the Zenko Temple in Shinano, when she accepts the hospitality of a woman who turns out to be none other than the real Yamauba, herself.

==Western literature==
Steve Berman&#x27;s short story, &quot;A Troll on a Mountain with a Girl&quot; features Yamauba.

Lafcadio Hearn, writing primarily for a Western audience, tells a tale like this:

:Then [they] saw the Yama-Uba,—the &quot;Mountain Nurse.&quot; Legend says she catches little children and nurses them for awhile, and then devours them. The Yama-Uba did not clutch at us, because her hands were occupied with a nice little boy, whom she was just going to eat. The child had been made wonderfully pretty to heighten the effect. The spectre, hovering in the air above a tomb at some distance ... had no eyes; its long hair hung loose; its white robe floated light as smoke. I thought of a statement in a composition by one of my pupils about ghosts: &quot;Their greatest peculiarity is that they have no feet.&quot; Then I jumped again, for the thing, quite soundlessly, but very swiftly, made through the air at me.

<text>Hamburger Sport-Verein e.V. (), commonly known as Hamburger SV () or Hamburg (), or HSV (), is a German sports club based in Hamburg, with its largest branch being its football department. Though the current HSV was founded in June 1919 from a merger of three earlier clubs, it traces its origins to 29 September 1887 when the first of the predecessors, SC Germania, was founded.

HSV has won the German national championship six times, the DFB-Pokal three times and the former League Cup twice. The team&#x27;s most successful period was from the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s when, in addition to several domestic honours, they won the 1976–77 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and the 1982–83 European Cup. The outstanding players of this period were Horst Hrubesch, Manfred Kaltz, and Felix Magath, all regulars in the West German National Team. To date, HSV&#x27;s last major trophy was the 1986–87 DFB-Pokal. Up until the 2017–18 Bundesliga season, which found the team relegated for the first time in history, HSV&#x27;s football team had the distinction of being the only team that had played continuously in the top tier of the German football league system since the founding of the club at the end of World War I. It was subsequently the only team that had played in every season of the Bundesliga since its foundation in 1963.

HSV play their home games at the Volksparkstadion in Bahrenfeld, a western district of Hamburg. The club colours are officially blue, white and black but the home kit of the team is white jerseys and red shorts. The team&#x27;s most common nickname is &quot;die Rothosen&quot; (the Red Shorts). As it is one of Germany&#x27;s oldest clubs, it is also known as &quot;der Dinosaurier&quot; (the Dinosaur). HSV have rivalries with Werder Bremen, with whom they contest the Nordderby, and Hamburg-based FC St. Pauli, with whom they contest the Hamburg derby.

HSV is notable in football as a grassroots-oriented organisation which places strong emphasis on youth development. The club had a team in the Women&#x27;s Bundesliga from 2003 to 2012 but it was demoted to Regionalliga level because of financial problems. Other club sections include badminton, baseball, basketball, bowling, boxing, cricket, darts, ice hockey, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, handball, and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation exercises. These sections represent about 10% of the club membership. HSV is one of the biggest sports clubs in Germany with over 84,000 members total in all its sections, and according to &quot;Forbes&quot; it is among the 20 largest football clubs in the world.

==History==
===Early years===
Hamburger Sport-Verein (HSV) traces its origin to the merger of &quot;Der Hohenfelder Sportclub&quot; and &quot;Wandsbek-Marienthaler Sportclub&quot; on 29 September 1887 to form Sport-Club Germania Hamburg, usually referred to as &quot;SC Germania&quot;. This was the first of three clubs that merged on 2 June 1919 to create HSV in its present form. HSV in its club statute recognises the founding of SC Germania as its own date of origin. The other two clubs in the June 1919 merger were &quot;Hamburger FC&quot; founded in 1888 and &quot;FC Falke Eppendorf&quot; dating back to 1906. The merger came about because the three clubs had been severely weakened by the impact of the First World War on manpower and finance, and they could not continue as separate entities.

SC Germania was formed originally as an athletics club, and did not begin to play football until 1891, when some Englishmen joined the club and introduced it. SC Germania had its first success in 1896, winning the Hamburg-Altona championship for the first of five times. Germania player emigrated to Brazil at the end of the 19th century, in the foundation of SC Internacional, the third oldest club of the country which became part of São Paulo FC, one of the major sports clubs of Brazil, in 1938 and SC Germânia of São Paulo, which later became EC Pinheiros.

Hamburger SC 1888 was founded by students on 1 June 1888. It later had links with a youth team called FC Viktoria 95 and, during World War I, was temporarily known as Viktoria Hamburg 88. SC Germania and Hamburger SC 1888 were among 86 clubs who founded the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (DFB; German Football Association) in Leipzig on 28 January 1900. FC Falke was founded by students in Eppendorf on 5 March 1906, but it was never a successful team and played in lower leagues.

The newly formed Hamburger SV contested in the 1922 national final against 1. FC Nürnberg, who were playing for their third consecutive title. The game was called off on account of darkness after three hours and ten minutes of play, drawn at 2–2. The re-match also went into extra time, and in an era that did not allow for substitutions, that game was called off at 2–2 when Nuremberg were reduced to just seven players (two were injured, two had been sent off) and the referee ruled they could not continue. Considerable wrangling ensued over the decision. The DFB awarded the win to HSV, but urged them to refuse the title in the name of good sportsmanship (which they grudgingly did). Ultimately, the Viktoria trophy was not officially presented that year.

HSV&#x27;s first success was achieved in the 1923 German football championship, when they won the national title against Union Oberschöneweide. They lost the title in 1924, losing the final to Nuremberg. They lifted the Viktoria again in 1928, when they defeated Hertha BSC 5–2 at the Altonaer Stadion in the final.

During the Third Reich, HSV had local success in the Gauliga Nordmark, also known as the Gauliga Hamburg, winning the league championship in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941 and 1945. At national level the club was unsuccessful, with semi-final losses in 1938 and 1939 their best performances in this period. Its main rival in the Gauliga in those years was Eimsbütteler TV.

===Post-war era===

HSV&#x27;s first post-war season was in the newly formed Stadtliga Hamburg, and they won its championship in 1946. The club also won the championship of the British occupation zone in 1947 and 1948, the only two seasons this competition was staged.

In May 1950, HSV became the first German team to tour the United States after World War II, and came away with a 6–0 record.

Playing in the Oberliga Nord after the resumption of league play in post-war West Germany in 1947, HSV became a dominant regional club. In 16 seasons from 1947 to 1948 to 1962–63, they won the Oberliga title 15 times, only posting an 11th-place finish in 1953–54. During this period, they scored over 100 goals in each of the 1951, 1955, 1961 and 1962 seasons. In 1953, the club&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer Uwe Seeler debuted. In nine seasons, he scored 267 goals in 237 Oberliga matches.

In 1956, HSV reached the DFB-Pokal final, but were beaten by Karlsruher SC. This was followed by losses in the finals of the national championship to Borussia Dortmund, in 1957, and Schalke 04, in 1958.

In 1960, HSV became German champions for the first time since 1928, defeating 1. FC Köln 3–2 in the championship final. Seeler, who scored twice in the final, was named West German Footballer of the Year.

As national champions, HSV represented West Germany in the 1960–61 European Cup. The club&#x27;s first ever match in European competition was a 5–0 defeat of Swiss club Young Boys in Bern, with HSV winning the tie 8–3 on aggregate. In the quarter-finals, they beat English champions Burnley before being defeated by Barcelona at the semi-final stage in a playoff game after the scores were level over two legs. The crowd of 77,600 at the Volksparkstadion for the first leg against Barcelona remains the record attendance for a HSV home match.

===Entry into the Bundesliga===

Germany&#x27;s first professional football league, the Bundesliga, was formed, with HSV one of 16 clubs invited to join that first season. Hamburger SV was the only original Bundesliga side to have played continuously in the top flight – without ever having been relegated – from when the league was formed in 1963, until they were relegated in the 2017–18 season, finishing in 17th place. They had shared that special status with Eintracht Frankfurt and 1. FC Kaiserslautern until 1996, and with 1. FC Köln until 1998. The Bundesliga celebrated its 40th anniversary on 24 August 2004 with a match between &quot;The Dinosaur&quot;, as the club has been nicknamed due to its old age, and Bayern Munich, the league&#x27;s most successful side.

In August 1963, HSV defeated Borussia Dortmund 3–0 at Hanover&#x27;s Niedersachsenstadion to win the club&#x27;s first DFB-Pokal. In the same month, the club played its first Bundesliga match, drawing 1–1 with Preußen Münster. HSV finished the Bundesliga&#x27;s first season in sixth place, with Uwe Seeler scoring 30 goals to secure the &quot;Torjägerkanone&quot;. He was also named Footballer of the Year for the second time. The DFB-Pokal victory enabled HSV to play in the 1963–64 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where they reached the quarter-final, falling to Lyon.

In 1967, HSV again reached the final of the DFB-Pokal where they were defeated 4–0 by Bayern Munich. HSV, however, were admitted to the following season&#x27;s European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where they lost to Milan in the final.

In 1970, Seeler was named Footballer of the Year for the third time. He retired at the end of the 1971–72 season in front of 72,000 fans at the Volksparkstadion. He ended his career with 137 goals from 239 Bundesliga matches and 507 goals from 587 appearances in all competitions. In the same season, HSV played in the UEFA Cup for the first time, but were knocked out in the first round by Scottish side St Johnstone.

===Golden era===
In 1973, HSV won the first edition of the DFB-Ligapokal, beating Borussia Mönchengladbach 4–0 in the final. A year later, they reached the DFB-Pokal final, where they were beaten by Eintracht Frankfurt. In 1976, HSV reached another DFB-Pokal final, beating 1. FC Kaiserslautern 2–0 to win the trophy for the second time in the club&#x27;s history. The following year, HSV achieved its first international success with a 2–0 win over Anderlecht in the final of the 1976–77 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The club then signed English player Kevin Keegan from European champions Liverpool. After spending much of the previous decade in mid-table, HSV achieved their best Bundesliga position in 1974–75 by finishing fourth. The club bettered this in 1975–76, with a second-place finish. Keegan&#x27;s first season there saw the club go down to tenth place, however, the player himself was named European Footballer of the Year.

In 1978, Branko Zebec was appointed trainer of HSV. The Yugoslav led the club to its first Bundesliga title in his first season in charge. Keegan was top scorer for &quot;die Rothosen&quot;, and was awarded the Ballon d&#x27;Or for a second successive year.
In the 1979–80 season, HSV returned to the European Cup for the first time since 1960–61. As had happened 19 years previously, HSV faced Spanish opposition in the semi-finals. After losing the first leg at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium 2–0, HSV beat six-time winners Real Madrid 5–1 at the Volksparkstadion to qualify for the final. HSV returned to Madrid to play Nottingham Forest in the final, where they were beaten 1–0. In the Bundesliga, HSV lost their title by two points, finishing in second place behind champions Bayern Munich.

In December 1980, HSV dismissed Zebec, who had been struggling with a drinking problem. His assistant Aleksandar Ristić was appointed caretaker for the remainder of the season and secured a second-place finish in the Bundesliga.

In 1981, Austrian coach Ernst Happel was appointed as Zebec&#x27;s permanent replacement. In his first season, his HSV side regained the Bundesliga title, and reached the UEFA Cup final, where they lost 4–0 on aggregate to Sweden&#x27;s IFK Göteborg.

Between 16 January 1982 and 29 January 1983, HSV went undefeated in the Bundesliga. The run stretched across 36 games and remained a Bundesliga record until November 2013, when it was broken by Bayern Munich.

A third Meisterschale followed at the end of the 1982–83 season, with HSV defending their title against local rivals Werder Bremen on goal difference. The same year, HSV defeated Juventus 1–0 in Athens to win the club&#x27;s first European Cup.

In December 1983, HSV traveled to Tokyo where they faced South American champions Grêmio in the Intercontinental Cup. The Brazilian club took home the trophy, with a 93rd minute winning goal. Back home, they lost the league championship to VfB Stuttgart on goal difference.
Both 1984–85 and 1985–86 were low seasons for HSV, with the club finishing fifth and seventh respectively. In 1986, midfielder Felix Magath, who had played for the club for ten years and scored the winning goal in the 1983 European Cup Final, retired from professional football.

In 1986–87, HSV finished second in the Bundesliga and won a fourth DFB-Pokal, beating Stuttgarter Kickers 3–1 in the final at West Berlin&#x27;s Olympiastadion. After this success, Ernst Happel left the club to return to Austria. He remains HSV&#x27;s most successful trainer, with two Bundesliga titles, one DFB-Pokal and one European Cup.

===Modern era===
In the early 1990s, HSV fell in financial trouble. Thomas Doll was sold to Lazio for a then record 16 million Deutsche Marks in June 1991. On the pitch, meanwhile, the team was in decline. After a fifth-place finish in 1990–91, HSV finished in the bottom half of the Bundesliga in four consecutive seasons.

In October 1995, Felix Magath returned to HSV to become the club&#x27;s trainer. The following month, Uwe Seeler also returned as the club president. Under the new regime, HSV finished fifth in the Bundesliga, securing European qualification for the first time in six years. The following season, HSV reached the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal. In May 1997, however, Magath was fired after a 4–0 defeat to 1. FC Köln, with the team one place above the relegation zone. HSV eventually finished in 13th place under reserve team coach Ralf Schehr.

In 1997, HSV appointed Frank Pagelsdorf, who would coach the team for over four years, making him the longest serving trainer since Ernst Happel. A ninth-place finish in 1997–98 was followed by seventh in 1998–99 and third in 1999–2000, the team&#x27;s best performance since 1986–87.

On 2 September 2000, the new Volksparkstadion was officially opened as the national team played its first 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier, against Greece.

In 2000–01, HSV competed in the UEFA Champions League for the first time since the competition&#x27;s expansion from the old European Cup. Their first match was a 4–4 draw against Juventus, with Tony Yeboah scoring the club&#x27;s first Champions League goal. HSV failed to qualify for the second round, but managed a 3–1 win over Juventus in the return fixture at the Stadio delle Alpi.

In July 2003, HSV won its first trophy in 16 years with a 4–2 defeat of Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Ligapokal final.

In August 2004, HSV lost in the early rounds of the DFB-Pokal by regional league side SC Paderborn. Referee, Robert Hoyzer, had accepted money from a Croatian gambling syndicate to fix the match, which he did, awarding two penalties to Paderborn and sending off HSV player Émile Mpenza.

Another third-place finish in 2005–06 saw HSV qualify for the Champions League for the second time. They finished bottom of Group G, with a solitary win against Russian club CSKA Moscow. In the league, the team was in 17th place going into the winter break, having won once in the league all season, leading to the dismissal of trainer Thomas Doll. Under new coach Huub Stevens, HSV advanced further away from the relegation zone and qualified for the UEFA Cup via a seventh-place finish and victory in the Intertoto Cup. The following season, Stevens led the team to fourth place in the Bundesliga before leaving to take over at Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven. He was replaced by Martin Jol, who took HSV to the semi-finals of both the 2008–09 UEFA Cup and the 2008–09 DFB-Pokal, both of which &quot;die Rothosen&quot; lost to rivals Werder Bremen. In the league, they did not qualify for the Champions League on the final day of the season. In the summer of 2009, after only one season, Jol departed to become coach of Ajax.

Under new coach Bruno Labbadia, HSV reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup (now renamed the UEFA Europa League) for the second season in a row. However, a defeat in the away leg to Fulham, days after the firing of Labbadia, denied the club the opportunity to play in the final, which was held at its home stadium.

On 13 October 2011, Thorsten Fink was appointed as coach with the team in the relegation zone after losing six of their opening eight matches. In HSV&#x27;s first nine games under Fink they were unbeaten, going into the winter break in 13th place. The team finished the season in 15th position, avoiding by five points what would have been its first relegation. In 2012–13, HSV recorded a seventh-place finish. During the season, however, the team equaled the club&#x27;s record Bundesliga defeat, losing 9–2 at the Allianz Arena to Bayern Munich.

Fink was replaced on 25 September 2013 by Bert van Marwijk, who in the same season was replaced by Mirko Slomka on 17 February 2014. Under Slomka, the club narrowly avoided its first relegation from the Bundesliga in May 2014, by defeating Greuther Fürth on the away goals rule in a play-off.

Hamburg once again changed managers due to a poor start of the season, firing Slomka in 2014. His successor Josef Zinnbauer held the job until March of said year and was replaced by interim coach Peter Knäbel, who was eventually replaced by returning Bruno Labbadia, who saved the club at the end of the season in the relegation play-off for the second year running against Karlsruher SC. Labbadia achieved only two points in the first ten games of the 2016–17 season, and was replaced by Markus Gisdol, reached 20 points in 9 games from the 19th match day to the 28th match day. On the last match day, Hamburg avoided the relegation play-offs and stayed in the Bundesliga.

====Relegation and missed promotions====
In the 2017–18 Bundesliga, after a 3–1 defeat in the first round of DFB-Pokal against the third-division team VfL Osnabrück, HSV had two wins against FC Augsburg and 1. FC Köln. However, eight games followed without a win. At the end of the first half of the season, HSV was in second last place in the table. After two defeats in the first two games of the second half, coach Markus Gisdol was dismissed. HSV hired Bernd Hollerbach, a former player of the club, as a new coach. After seven games without a win and a 6–0 defeat against Bayern Munich, he was also dismissed in 2018. A few days before the game against Bayern, the club announced the dismissal of CEO Heribert Bruchhagen. Frank Wettstein, CFO of the club, was appointed as the new CEO. On the day of his appointment, he dismissed the sports director Jens Todt. The club hired former successful HSV player Thomas von Heesen as a sports consultant until the end of season. For the last eight games in the 2017–18 Bundesliga, the club promoted the coach of Hamburger SV II, Christian Titz. In the Regionalliga Nord (fourth league), his team were the top of the table. With four wins and an offensively minded style of play, the coach convinced the club and received a two-year contract.

After the low season in the 2017–18 Bundesliga under three different coaches, a final day win over Borussia Mönchengladbach was not enough to escape relegation after Wolfsburg won against Köln 4–1. They were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga for the first time in the Bundesliga&#x27;s 55-year history, causing riots by Hamburg supporters.

After the relegation Christian Titz was sacked in October 2018, and replaced by Hannes Wolf. Hamburg did not gain promotion back to the Bundesliga, and failed to reach the playoffs, with a one-point difference between them and Union Berlin. The team reached the semi-finals of the 2018–19 DFB-Pokal, before being defeated by RB Leipzig 1–3 at home.

For the 2019–20 2. Bundesliga, their second year in the 2. Bundesliga, Wolf was laid-off and was replaced by Dieter Hecking. They did not get a return to the Bundesliga by one-point, and they were eliminated in the second round of the 2019–20 DFB Pokal by Vfb Stuttgart 1–2 in extra time.

By again missing promotion, Hecking&#x27;s contract was not extended. For the 2020–21 season, Daniel Thioune was brought in as the new head coach from league rivals VfL Osnabrück. The season began with a 1–4 first-round knockout loss in the DFB-Pokal to 3. Liga club Dynamo Dresden. Despite this loss, HSV then started the season and won the first 5 games. After a subsequent winless streak of 5 games, 3 of which were lost in a row, the team stabilised again from matchday 11 and went undefeated until the winter break. HSV ended the season as first in the league table. From matchday 20 and onwards, HSV were again winless for 5 games. After 2 wins, another winless series of 5 games followed from matchday 27 and onwards, during which, the club drew against Hannover 96 3–3. The club also lost to relegation candidates SV Sandhausen. Due to this development, Thioune was released at the beginning of May 2021, and replaced by the head of academy Horst Hrubesch for the final three games of the season. At that point, HSV were in third place with 52 points, five points from a spot guaranteeing direct promotion.

In the 2021–22 season, HSV reached the promotion playoff spot, finishing third on goal difference over Darmstadt 98. Once again, however, the season ended with HSV losing to Bundesliga&#x27;s 16th place side Hertha Berlin 1–2 in the playoff, losing 0–2 at home, despite winning the first leg in Berlin. In the DFB-Pokal, Hamburg reached the semi-finals, where they lost 1–3 to SC Freiburg.

In the 2022–23 season, their fifth season in the 2. Bundesliga, the club had the highest spectator average of any second-division club in Europe. During that season, Hamburger SV were in the top three places since matchday 6, and finished the year 2022 in second place. On the last matchday, HSV played an away match against SV Sandhausen, where they won 1–0, and as SSV Jahn Regensburg were leading 2–1 against second-place 1. FC Heidenheim, HSV were about to be promoted to Bundesliga. However, during eleven minutes of stoppage time, Heidenheim scored two goals to finish top; hence, Hamburger SV had to play the promotion/relegation play-offs against VfB Stuttgart. They lost both legs, missing promotion to the top division for the fifth year in a row.

In the 2023–24 season, HSV spent the majority of the season in the top three, only briefly slipping down to fourth on matchday 19, when they lost 3–4 against Karlsruher SC. However, following a 1–1 against Greuther Fürth on matchday 27, they dropped to fourth place, where they remained for the rest of the season. For a sixth time in a row, HSV narrowly missed promotion to the Bundesliga, while the club&#x27;s rivals FC St. Pauli and Holstein Kiel were both promoted.

==Stadium==

Hamburger SV plays its home games in the Volksparkstadion, which was previously known as the Imtech Arena between 2010 and 2015. Built on the site of the original Volksparkstadion, opened in 1953, the current stadium was opened in 2000, and has a capacity of 57,000 – approximately 47,000 seats with another 10,000 spectators standing. The first Volksparkstadion had been a venue for the 1974 World Cup and UEFA Euro 1988. The Volksparkstadion is a UEFA category one stadium, which certifies it to host UEFA Europa League and UEFA Champions League finals. The stadium was the site of four group matches and a quarter-final of the 2006 World Cup, hosted by Germany, and was known as &quot;FIFA World Cup Stadium Hamburg&quot; during the event. It was also the venue for the 2010 UEFA Europa League Final.

HSV fans can be buried at a dedicated graveyard near the home stadium, covered in turf from the original Hamburg pitch.

==Rivals and affinities==

HSV contests the Nordderby with fellow Northern Germany side Werder Bremen. In Spring 2009, HSV faced Werder four times in only three weeks, and Werder defeated HSV in the UEFA-Cup semi-final, as well as in the DFB-Pokal semi-final.

Furthermore, HSV shares a cross-town rivalry with FC St. Pauli. When, after seven years in different leagues, the game where HSV played against FC St. Pauli, there were already disputes between both fan groups several weeks before the game. It started when about 100 HSV fans interrupted a St. Pauli concert because it took place on the &quot;HSV-side&quot; of the Reeperbahn. In a league game, the HSV fans showed a banner in the stadium with the inscription &quot;Stellt euch endlich unsrer Gier – 100 Ihr : 100 Wir&quot; (&quot;Finally satisfy our lust – 100 of you vs. 100 of us&quot;). After fans of FC St. Pauli attacked HSV fans working on a choreography for the game and destroyed parts of it, some HSV fans threatened them by hanging figures in the colours of the rival at several bridges throughout the city. In addition, one day later there was a march of about 80 HSV-Ultras across the Reeperbahn, where insulting chants against St. Pauli were screamed. In the hours leading up to first 2. Bundesliga Hamburg Derby on 10 March 2019 at the Millerntor-Stadion, the supporters groups of both teams were escorted by the Hamburg police to avoid conflict. They won with a 4–0 win over FC St. Pauli at the Millerntor-Stadion, the first time HSV had won at the stadium in the St. Pauli quarter since 1962. In response to Benedikt Pliquett&#x27;s celebratory kick of HSV&#x27;s corner flag at the Volksparkstadion in 2011, Tom Mickel mimicked Pliquett with a &quot;Kung-Fu Kick&quot; of his own, according to MOPO.
HSV have an affinity with Scottish club Rangers. The link between Rangers and Hamburg dates back to 1977, when the Hamburg Rangers Supporters&#x27; Club was set up by HSV fans who had visited Rangers matches before and were thrilled by the atmosphere at Ibrox. The links were further strengthened when Rangers signed Jörg Albertz from Hamburg. The fans of Rangers also have a fan-friendship with the German club Hamburger SV, dating from the 1970s when Scots moved to the German port in search of work and reinforced by their shared affection for the midfielder Jörg Albertz.
This link was formalised in February 2021 with the formation of an official club partnership between the two sides. 
Conversely, St. Pauli has a long-standing friendship with Rangers&#x27; city rivals, Celtic. The friendship exists due to both the HSV-Rangers affinity and the shared left-wing politics of Celtic and St. Pauli fans. HSV fans provoked Celtic, whose fanbase have historically been sympathetic to Irish republicanism, with a controversial tifo when they played each other in the Europa League in 2009. It displayed a Union Jack bearing the words &quot;No Surrender&quot;, a popular Ulster loyalist slogan which originated from the Northern Irish ethnoreligious conflict known as the Troubles.

HSV have a friendship bond with Hannover 96 due to both being known by the abbreviation &quot;HSV&quot;. Their meetings involve the visitors&#x27; club song being played, and fans chanting &quot;HSV&quot; from each end of the stadium.

Furthermore, Hamburger SV has a friendship bond with Arminia Bielefeld – both teams share the same colours, resulting in the popular fan chant &quot;Schwarz, weiß, blau – Arminia und der HSV&quot; (&quot;Black, white, blue – Arminia and the HSV&quot;). Especially in the 1990s, multiple players transferred between the two clubs.
In addition, some fan groups maintain good contacts with the fourth division team VfB Lübeck, whose fans also have an aversion to St. Pauli and Holstein Kiel. In 2013, HSV helped the club, which was threatened by insolvency, with a free friendly match, in which the team competed with several national players to attract as many spectators as possible and left the entire earnings for VfB Lübeck.
==Fans==
The band Abschlach! has written the HSV anthem &quot;Mein Hamburg lieb ich sehr&quot;. The band always plays this song before HSV games.

HSV has more than 700 officially registered fan clubs in Germany and abroad. These include &quot;Rautengeil Fallingbostel&quot;, &quot;Hermanns Treue Riege&quot;, &quot;Totale Offensive e. V.&quot; and the &quot;Wilhelmsburg Boys&quot;. HSV ultra groups are or were the &quot;Clique du Nord&quot;, &quot;Poptown&quot;, and &quot;Chosen Few&quot;. The &quot;Rothosen&quot; supporters&#x27; association founded in April 1972 is the oldest HSV fan club. It still has around 40 members. The business fan club of Hamburger SV was registered by HSV as an official fan club in 2006. This fan club was founded by entrepreneurs and combines sporting interests with business interests. Since the 2006–07 season, the Hamburger Sport-Verein has had a fan club for gay and bisexual fans called &quot;BLUE PRIDE&quot;, which merged into the &quot;Volksparkjunxx&quot; in January 2012. The members of fan club &quot;Die Löwen&quot; are aggressive. The group was associated with skinheads and right-wing radicalism in the 1980s. The Bremen fan Adrian Maleika was murdered by members of the group on 16 October 1982.

As a reaction to the murder of Maleika, the HSV fan project was founded, which still exists today and is financially supported by the German Football League and the Hamburg Authority for Labour, Social Affairs, Family and Integration. The fan project makes travel offers for away games and supports the Supporters Club with its offers. Numerous events take place in the fan house, also with the support of HSV itself.

The Supporters Club, founded in 1993, has (as of 1 June 2019) been joined by 66,489 fans, who have thus also become members of HSV. The 36 founding members include the former board member responsible for membership matters, Oliver Scheel, the former supervisory board members Henning Trolsen and Christian Reichert, and the current director of the HSV Museum, Dirk Mansen.

As a reaction to the spin-off, fans founded the &quot;HFC Falke&quot; – based on the model of FC United of Manchester – which started playing in the 2015–16 season, and as of 2024, are playing in the Hamburg district league north.

==Club kit and colours==

The club colours are officially blue, white and black, according to its statute, but its fans use the combination &quot;schwarz-weiss-blau&quot; (black-white-blue) in their songs and chants; they also chant &quot;HSV&quot; . The club crest is a black and white diamond on a blue background. These were the colours of SC Germania. The use of the blue background is a link with Hamburg&#x27;s maritime tradition as the &quot;Blue Peter flag&quot; signal (meaning &quot;All Aboard&quot; or &quot;Outward Bound&quot;) is a white rectangle on a similar blue background.

In contrast, the team&#x27;s home kit is white jerseys and red shorts, which are the colours of the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. As a result, the team&#x27;s most common nickname is &quot;die Rothosen&quot; (&quot;the Red Shorts&quot;). HSV was previously also known as &quot;der Dinosaurier&quot; (&quot;the Dinosaur&quot;), and used a dinosaur mascot called &quot;Hermann&quot; (named after long-time club physiotherapist Hermann Rieger) for marketing purposes.

HSV&#x27;s kit was made by Adidas from 1978 to 1995 and the club re-engaged Adidas in 2007, having worked with a number of its competitors in the meantime. The first shirt sponsorship was introduced in 1974. The following is a list of shirt sponsors by date:

==In international competitions==
HSV&#x27;s first participation in European competition came after they won the German championship in 1960 and were invited to take part in the 1960–61 European Cup. They had a match in the preliminary round, and their first round opponents were Young Boys. HSV won the two-legged tie 8–3 on aggregate, beating the Swiss side 0–5 in the away leg on 2 November 1960, and then drawing 3–3 at home on 27 November.

HSV reached the semi-final of the European Cup in 1961. Subsequently, they have twice played in the final, losing 1–0 to Nottingham Forest in 1980 and defeating Juventus 1–0 in 1983. With Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich, HSV is one of three German teams who have won the European Cup. HSV won the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1976–77, and have been runners-up in both that competition and the UEFA Cup. Their most recent European campaign was the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League, in which they reached the semi-final.

Hamburg became, in 1982, the first club in European football to have been runner-up in all three major UEFA club competitions, having lost the 1967–68 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, the 1979–80 European Cup and the 1981–82 UEFA Cup finals. Additionally, having lost the European Super Cup for the first time in the 1977 edition, the 1983 Intercontinental Cup and in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup, they became the first and only club in Europe to have obtained the silver medal in all six confederation competitions.

HSV&#x27;s biggest win in a European match occurred on 23 October 1974 when they defeated Romanian team Brașov 8–0 in a UEFA Cup second round tie. Their biggest defeat was in the second leg of the 1977 Super Cup when they lost 6–0 to Liverpool at Anfield on 6 December. Manfred Kaltz with 81 has made the most appearances for HSV in Europe and Horst Hrubesch with 20 is their leading goalscorer.

Based on data published by UEFA, a summary of HSV&#x27;s European record to the end of the 2021–22 season is as follows:

According to UEFA, HSV is currently unranked among European clubs. The last year that the club had a coefficient was in 2014 when it ranked 64th (34.328).

==Honours==

HSV have the record in German football of having won the most regional titles, having won 31 regional titles. However, the regional titles do not count as a trophy or even as a title itself. Winning a regional title only guaranteed a club to battle, with other regional winning clubs, for the German Championship.

Hamburg&#x27;s three Bundesliga championships entitle the club to display one gold star of the &quot;Verdiente Meistervereine&quot;. Under the current award system, their pre-Bundesliga championships are not recognized, and so they are not entitled to the second star of a five-time champion.

After the replay of the championship final in 1922 had to be abandoned due to the opponents no longer having enough players on the ground, the German Football Association (DFB) requested HSV to renounce the title, which the club did.

During his first season with Hamburger SV (2000–01), Sergej Barbarez became the top scorer for his club with 22 goals and joint top scorer of the Bundesliga with Ebbe Sand.

Until the 2017–18 season, HSV took pride in its status as the only club to have played continuously in the Bundesliga since its foundation. A large clock in the northwest corner of the Volksparkstadion marked the time, down to the second, since the league was founded on 24 August 1963.

<doc id="535887" wikidata="Q44470" url="?curid=535887" title="Uwe Seeler">
<text>Uwe Seeler (; 5 November 1936 – 21 July 2022) was a German footballer and football official. As a striker, he was a prolific scorer for Hamburger SV and also made 72 appearances for the West Germany national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in German football history, Seeler was named one of FIFA&#x27;s 100 greatest living players by Pelé in 2004. He was the first football player to be awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.

==Playing career==

===Club career===
Seeler followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a player for Hamburger SV, making his first team debut in 1954 in a DFB-Pokal match, aged just under 18, scoring four goals (8–2 vs. Holstein Kiel). In later years, despite tempting offers from Italian and Spanish clubs, he remained loyal to Hamburg, working on a second career as a merchant besides playing football.

Seeler was a gifted, powerful, and prolific striker who, among other things, was most of all renowned for his leadership, consistency, overhead kicks, and aerial ability. He scored 137 times in 239 Bundesliga games, 43 times in 72 international games for the German national team, and 21 times in 29 European club tournament games. He was captain of both his club team and the national team for many years. He and his club won the German championship in 1960 and the DFB-Pokal in 1963. He was top scorer of the first Bundesliga season in 1963–64 and German Footballer of the Year in 1960, 1964, and 1970. During the 1960–61 season, Seeler, alongside his brother , helped to lead Hamburger SV to the semi-finals of the European Cup, where they narrowly missed out on the final against Benfica, losing out to Barcelona in a play-off match. During the 1967–68 season, Seeler also helped Hamburg to reach the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, finishing the competition as top scorer, only to lose out to AC Milan.

In 1978, he and his former teammate Franz-Josef Hönig played for Cork Celtic in a one-off sponsored event. Seeler had ended his active playing career in 1972. However, this match turned out to be an official League of Ireland one and Uwe scored twice. Thus, his overall record of goals scored in league and championship matches adds up to 446 (Hamburger SV 444, Cork Celtic 2). 
His 404 goals in German Oberliga and Bundesliga league games is a record that stands as of today, his 406 goals in league games overall making him the second-best German goalscorer behind Gerd Müller.

===International career===
Seeler participated in the same four FIFA World Cups as Pelé did: 1958, 1962, 1966, and 1970. Of those West German World Cup teams, the 1966 side reached the final, where they lost to host nation England 4–2 in extra time. In 1958, the German team finished in fourth place; in 1970 the West German team finished in third after being eliminated by European rivals Italy in the semi-finals, following a closely fought 4–3 extra-time loss, a match often referred to as the &quot;Game of the Century&quot;. In the previous round, a backward second-half header against England tied the score 2–2, a game West Germany went on to win 3–2.

Although Seeler never won a World Cup (his involvement as a player in the tournament started four years after West Germany won their first World Cup (1954) and ended four years before they won their second (1974)), he had a prolific career in the tournament; he was the first player ever to appear in 20 World Cup matches (he retired with 21 matches played, tied for third all-time); the first ever to score in four World Cups (beating Pelé by only a few minutes), and the first player to score at least two goals in each of four World Cups (matched in 2014 by his compatriot Miroslav Klose). He also ranks third in all-time minutes played in World Cups, with 1,980, behind Paolo Maldini and Lothar Matthäus. In total, he scored nine goals across the four World Cups in which he played, as well as three goals in World Cup Qualifying matches; he scored 43 times in 72 international appearances between 1954 and 1970. A photo by of a dejected Seeler leaving the field after the 1966 World Cup final is famous in Germany, and was voted as &quot;Photo of the Century&quot; by &quot;kicker&quot; magazine.

==Career after football==

He had a two-and-a-half-year tenure as president of Hamburger SV, which began in 1995, and ended in resignation in 1998 due to a financial scandal, for which he took responsibility. Seeler, however, was not himself implicated in the irregularities.

==Recognition==

Seeler was a tremendously popular player due to his fairness and modesty and is still widely called &quot;Uns Uwe&quot; (West Low German: &quot;Our Uwe&quot;) in Hamburg and the surrounding area. The DFB (German FA) made him the second honorary captain of the German national team in 1972 (the first being Fritz Walter). In 2003, he became an honorary citizen of his hometown Hamburg; the first time the honor was bestowed on a sportsman. That year he also published his memoirs &quot;Danke, Fußball&quot; (&quot;Thank you, football&quot;). 2005 saw the unveiling of a giant monument in front of the Hamburger SV stadium depicting his right foot.

==Film appearances==
Seeler appeared in a cameo role in the popular 1972 Heinz Erhardt comedy &quot;Willi wird das Kind schon schaukeln&quot; (English title: &quot;Willi Manages the Whole Thing&quot;), playing himself.

==Personal life==
From 1959 until his death, Uwe Seeler lived with his wife in Harksheide, today a district of Norderstedt in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region.

Seeler&#x27;s grandson, Levin Öztunalı, is also a professional footballer.

==Death==
Seeler died on 21 July 2022, aged 85, in his home in Norderstedt. He was honoured later in the day with a moment of silence before the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022 quarter-final between Germany and Austria. The following second matchday of the 2. Bundesliga, where Hamburg played a home match against Hansa Rostock, as well as the first round of the DFB-Pokal also began with a minute of silence in Seeler&#x27;s tribute. The Bundesliga home game of HSV featured supporters dressed in black displaying a banner reading &quot;loyal and modest – the greatest of all time&quot; (&quot;&quot;Loyal und bescheiden - der Größte aller Zeiten&quot;) in honor of Seeler&#x27;s club career.

<text>John Morgan (September 21, 1930 – November 15, 2004) was a Welsh-born Canadian comedian.

Born in Aberdare, Wales, Morgan and his comedy partner, Martin Bronstein, co-founded the comedy troupe &quot;The Jest Society&quot; in Montreal in 1970. The troupe moved to Toronto and evolved into the Royal Canadian Air Farce in 1973 which had a sketch comedy CBC Radio show under that name on which he played numerous characters such as mortician Hector Baggley and socialite Amy De La Pompa. When the troupe moved to CBC Television in 1993, he played additional characters on the Air Farce television show such as perpetually disgusted Scotsman Jock McBile, and monosyllabic Mike from Canmore, as well as satirical portrayals of such prominent individuals as Herb Gray, Deborah Grey, and Boris Yeltsin.

Morgan wrote the pilot for the popular Canadian sitcom &quot;King of Kensington&quot;. Prior to founding the Jest Society, he and writing partner Bronstein created and starred in the CBC radio series &quot;Funny You Should Say That&quot;. 
He also had his own BBC Radio series called &quot;It&#x27;s All in the Mind of John Morgan&quot;.

In 2000, he was nominated for a Canadian Comedy Award. Along with the original cast of Air Farce – Roger Abbott, Don Ferguson and Luba Goy – Morgan received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement in 1998.

Before launching his comedy career in 1966, Morgan worked as a journalist, editor, teacher, and pub owner.

Morgan retired from Air Farce in 2001. On November 15, 2004, Morgan died at his home in Toronto from a heart attack at the age of 74.

<text>John Orson Whitaker, Jr. (born December 13, 1959) is an American actor notable for several film and television performances during his childhood. The redheaded Whitaker played Jody Davis on &quot;Family Affair&quot; from 1966 to 1971. He originated the role of Scotty Baldwin on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1965, played the lead in Hallmark&#x27;s 1969 &quot;The Littlest Angel&quot;, and portrayed the title character in the 1973 musical version of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;.

==Early life==
Whitaker was born in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Van Nuys, the fifth of eight children of Thelma and John O. Whitaker, Sr.

==Acting career==

Whitaker began his professional acting career at the age of three by appearing in a television commercial for a local used-car dealer. He went on to appear in advertisements for Mattel Toymakers, for such toys as Larry the Lion and Crackers the Parrot in their Animal Yackers series. In 1965, Whitaker originated the character of the young Scotty Baldwin in the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. In 1966, he acted in a major feature film, &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot;, which also starred Brian Keith. After Keith was cast as the lead in the television series &quot;Family Affair&quot;, he recommended Whitaker to play the part of his on-screen nephew.

&quot;Family Affair&quot; aired from 1966 to 1971. It co-starred Whitaker playing the role of an orphaned boy named Jody Davis, living in a high-rise apartment in New York City with his twin sister Buffy (Anissa Jones) and older sister Cissy (Kathy Garver), his bachelor uncle Bill Davis (Brian Keith), and Bill&#x27;s gentleman&#x27;s gentleman, Mr. French (Sebastian Cabot). Jody and Buffy were originally supposed to be different ages, but the show&#x27;s producers thought Whitaker and Jones looked so cute together that they changed them to be twins.

While still appearing regularly on &quot;Family Affair&quot;, in 1968 Whitaker was a featured guest star (along with Julie Harris) in &quot;A Dream to Dream,&quot; a poignant episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, written by series co-star Michael Landon.

During breaks in production of &quot;Family Affair,&quot; Whitaker starred in the Hallmark Hall of Fame production, &quot;The Littlest Angel,&quot; alongside Fred Gwynne and Tony Randall, and an episode of the long-running Western, &quot;The Virginian&quot;; both aired in 1969.

Also, in 1969, Whitaker was a guest star playing Jack in an episode of &quot;Bewitched&quot; titled &quot;Samantha and the Beanstalk&quot;. In 1970, Whitaker played the part of Willie in a &quot;Green Acres&quot; episode titled &quot;The Confrontation&quot;. Later, he played Dinky Watson in a &quot;Green Acres&quot; episode titled &quot;The Beeping Rock&quot;. Later on in 1970, he played the main character of Justin in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&#x27; film &quot;A Day For Justin&quot;.

After &quot;Family Affair&quot;, he appeared in a two-part episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in 1971. Whitaker went on to star in the 1973 Sid and Marty Krofft Saturday morning children&#x27;s series &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot; alongside Billy Barty and Scott Kolden, and appeared in feature films, including Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snowball Express&quot; (1972), &quot;The Biscuit Eater&quot; (1972), &quot;Napoleon and Samantha&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Magic Pony&quot; (1977). His most prominent feature film role during this period was the lead in the musical version of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; (1973).

In an interview with Tom Snyder on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, Whitaker said he had worked as a computer consultant at CBS. He later joined a Los Angeles talent agency, Whitaker Entertainment, owned by his sister. Whitaker also was Dana Plato&#x27;s manager.

In 1999, Whitaker received the Young Artist Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award at the 20th Youth in Film Awards.

In 2012, Whitaker co-produced and co-hosted a short-lived radio talk show, &quot;The Dr. Zod and Johnny Show&quot;. The following year, he appeared onstage in Judson Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; in the cameo role of Judge Taylor.

In 2016, Whitaker gave a guest-star cameo appearance in Amazon&#x27;s reboot of &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot;. In the premiere episode, he played the part of heckling boat owner Zach, against David Arquette&#x27;s salty character Captain Barnabas. The episode had a similar cameo appearance by original show creators Sid and Marty Krofft.

==Filmography==
==Personal life==

Whitaker struggled as an adult with an addiction to drugs and alcohol until his family held an intervention and threatened to cut off contact with him unless he got help. He agreed and joined a twelve-step program; he later became a certified drug counselor and founder of a nonprofit organization for Spanish-speaking addicts. In 2011, he said he had been clean and sober for 13 years.

Whitaker grew up in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) and attended the same congregation as Marie Osmond. He and she became friends, and their friendship continued in adult life. After leaving the LDS church for several years, Whitaker rejoined the church.

<text>The Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) EC120 Colibri (&quot;hummingbird&quot;) is a five-seat, single-engine, light utility helicopter. Jointly designed and developed by Eurocopter, China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corporation (CATIC), Harbin Aviation Industries (Group) Ltd (HAIG) and Singapore Technologies Aerospace Ltd (STAero) at Eurocopter France&#x27;s Marignane facility, the EC120B was assembled by Eurocopter in France and Australia.

In China, the aircraft is produced by Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation (HAMC) as the HC120. In 2004, HAMC began local manufacturing of the HC120 at their assembly line in Harbin, in northern China. In the Chinese market, both the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and multiple local police forces have purchased HC120 helicopters.

==Development==
The EC120 Colibri has its origins in the P120, a proposal by French helicopter manufacturer Aérospatiale that was intended to replace both their Aérospatiale Gazelle and Aérospatiale SA 315B Lama single engine helicopters. During the 1980s, Aérospatiale sought international partners with which to co-produce the P120, these included aerospace companies in China, Singapore, and Australia. In the aftermath of the Chinese Government&#x27;s crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the exclusion of Chinese involvement in the project was speculated.

On 20 October 1992, a contract for the joint development contract of the new helicopter was signed by the three principle partners of the project, the newly formed Eurocopter, China National Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corporation (CATIC) and Singapore Aerospace Ltd (STAero). Under the joint development agreement, Eurocopter received a 61% controlling interest and technical leader in the programme, CATIC received a 24% work share and STAero received a 15% work share; CATIC designed and produced the cabin structure and fuel system, STAero produced the tail boom, access doors, and composite materials, while Eurocopter produced the dynamic assemblies, installed the avionics, electrical and hydraulic systems, and conducted the final assembly activity. Development of the rotorcraft allowed Eurocopter to extend its range to include rotorcraft.
On 9 June 1995, the first prototype EC120 Colibri conducted its maiden flight. By February 1996, the prototype had accumulated 60 flight hours, a second prototype joined the test program later that year. In February 1997, the EC120 Colibri was formally launched at the Helicopter Association International (HAI) show in Anaheim, California; by June 1997, more than 50 orders had been received for the type. By October 1998, more than 100 orders had been received for the type, leading Eurocopter to increase the production rate from four helicopters per month to six. In 2002, Eurocopter was in the process of establishing a second assembly line for the EC120 at Australian Aerospace&#x27;s facility in Brisbane, Australia.

In September 2003, Eurocopter and China Aviation Industry Corporation II (AVIC II) expanded their partnership agreement to include a co-production arrangement with AVIC II-subsidiary Harbin Aircraft Industry Group (HAIG). On 11 June 2004, a final production agreement was signed; under the agreement, CATIA and HAIG received exclusive market rights in China, and Eurocopter agreed to stop selling French-built EC120s in mainland China. In June 2014, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of China became the launch customer for the Harbin-produced HC120, reportedly placing an order for eight of the type with options for fifty more.

On 30 November 2017 Airbus Helicopters formally announced the end of the H120 program citing low delivery numbers. Only five H120s were delivered in 2016 compared to 63 Robinson R-66s. Airbus stated they are moving away from the lower end of the market spectrum and those helicopters are not as sophisticated as their traditional product line.

=== Diesel demonstrator ===
Within the Green Rotorcraft European Clean Sky Joint Technology Initiative environmental research program started in 2011, a H120 Technology demonstrator equipped with a HIPE AE440 high-compression aircraft diesel engine, running on jet fuel, first flew on 6 November 2015. It aimed to reduce pollutant emissions and increase fuel efficiency, nearly double the range and enhance operations in hot and high conditions.

The powerplant trialed was a liquid-cooled, dry sump lubricated 4.6-liter 90° V8 engine with an common rail direct injection, fully machined aluminum blocks, titanium connecting rods, steel pistons and liners, one turbocharger per cylinder bank. With an air-to-air intercooler, it weighed without gearbox and the installed powerpack weighs . The rotors were driven via the existing transmission, the faster-turning Turbomeca Arrius turboshaft was replaced with a multiplier gearbox.

The brake specific fuel consumption was 200 g/kW⋅h. Torque oscillations were reduced through a light torsional shaft and vibrations are damped by Silent blocs. It was manufactured by Teos Powertrain Engineering—a joint venture between Mecachrome and D2T (IFPEN group)—for the mechanical design, engine main parts manufacturing, assembly and testing and Austro Engine for the dual-channel FADEC and harness, fuel system, airworthiness. Power was maintained at 2,500 m and ISA+20° and it achieved 42% a fuel consumption reduction, reducing the direct operating costs by 30% along with simpler maintenance.

==Design==

The EC120B Colibri is a single-engine multimission helicopter, designed for safe, simple, and cost-effective operations. It incorporates several of Eurocopter&#x27;s trademarked technologies, those of prominence are the three-bladed Speriflex main rotor head and the eight-bladed fenestron anti-torque tail rotor; these have been partially credited with contributing to the rotorcraft&#x27;s noise signature, which is 6.7 decibels below International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) limits. 

Airbus Helicopters has claimed that the EC120 B possesses the lowest operating cost in its class. As of 2014, the EC120 has the distinction of being the only single-engine rotorcraft to be certified to JAR/FAR 27 standards; measures incorporated to meet these standards include an energy-attenuating main structure, energy-absorbent seats for all on board, and a crash-resistant fuel system.

The aircraft features a wide, ergonomic cabin with high levels of external visibility, which can accommodate a single pilot along with four passengers in typical passenger configuration. The design of the cabin is suitable for a wide variety of civilian and parapublic missions, such as utility transport, offshore transport, training, law enforcement, casualty evacuation and corporate transport. In the casualty evacuation role, the rotorcraft can carry one pilot and one stretcher patient as well as one or two medical attendants.

In a cargo-carrying capacity, the EC120 can carry one pilot plus of total useful load volume spread between the cabin and the hold, which is externally accessible from the right-hand side and to the rear, as well as from the cabin in some configurations. To ease cargo operations, the cabin floor is flat and unobstructed; alternatively, a cargo sling can be installed to carry cargo of up to .
According to Airbus Helicopters, the EC120B integrates a high level of advanced technology to make the rotorcraft easier and safer to fly, as well as to reduce costs. A particular emphasis was placed on allowing end-customers to perform as much of the maintenance tasks themselves. The primary instrument panel is the twin-screen vehicle and engine multifunction display (VEMD) which provides control and monitoring of various aspects of the rotorcraft, such as the fenestron tail rotor and key engine parameters; the VEMD decreases overall pilot workload for greater safety. In a baseline configuration, flight controls are installed only on the right-hand side, dual controls or left-hand only flight controls can be optionally installed. Third parties have offered their own avionics suites for the EC120, adding functionality such as an autopilot.

In addition to various civil roles, the EC120 has also been used by several military operators to conduct training, observation and light utility missions. Airbus Helicopter has promoted the type in a training capacity due to features such as positive control response, performance computation systems, modern instrumentation for ease of use, overall compact size, and a high level of cabin visibility. 

A wide range of optional equipment can be installed upon the EC120 B, this includes a wire strike protection system, air conditioning, sand filter, skis, windshield wipers, electrical external mirrors, a cargo sling, emergency flotation gear, forward looking infrared (FLIR) cameras, and external spotlights. For corporate customers, the EC120 can be equipped with a &quot;Stylence&quot; interior, offering a luxurious interior with leather upholstery, in-flight office and telecommunications facilities, along with reduced noise and vibration levels via additional insulation.

==Operational history==

The first EC120B was delivered in 1998. By 2008, Eurocopter had already delivered more than 550 Colibris to various customers.

In 2004, the United States Department of Homeland Security U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) selected the EC120B to meet its Light Sign Cutter requirement, a program potentially involving 55 aircraft with a total value of US$75 million in then-year dollars. In 2006, the CBP ordered 15 EC120B helicopters, with a further five aircraft since ordered.

The Spanish Air and Space Force (SASF) has procured a number of EC120s, which are used as rotary-wing trainers at the Armilla AFB. In 2003, the SPAF formed an aerobatic display team, the Patrulla ASPA, which use the type; a typical display involves five EC120s performing complex manoeuvers in addition to formation flight.

In January 2008, the French Defense Ministry selected the EC120 as the French Army&#x27;s new lead-in rotary-wing trainer to replace the Aérospatiale Gazelle. 36 EC120 Bs equipped with Sagem avionics shall be operated through a 22-year public-private partnership (PPP) with operator Hélidax. On 12 October 2010, the final EC120 was delivered to Hélidax.

Since 2011, a number of EC120s have been operated by the traffic police of Kurdistan, Iraq. As of 2014, the crews are trained to undertake surveillance and rescue missions.

<doc id="535900" wikidata="Q1556" url="?curid=535900" title="St. Pauli">
<text>St. Pauli (Sankt Pauli; ) is a quarter of the city of Hamburg belonging to the centrally located Hamburg-Mitte borough. Situated on the right bank of the Elbe river, the nearby Landungsbrücken is a northern part of the port of Hamburg. St. Pauli contains a world-famous red-light district around the iconic Reeperbahn area. As of 2020 the area had 21,902 residents.

==History==
At the beginning of the 17th century it developed as a suburb called &#x27;Hamburger Berg&#x27; (Hamburg mountain) outside the gates of the nearby city of Hamburg and close to the city of Altona. The name comes from a hill in that area that was planned by Hamburg in 1620 for defense reasons (free field of fire for the artillery). Therefore, settlement was initially allowed there, but soon businesses, which were desired inside neither Hamburg nor Altona, e.g., for their smell or noise, were relegated to &#x27;Hamburger Berg&#x27;. Furthermore, the rope makers (or &#x27;Reeper&#x27; in Low German) were placed here because in the city it was hard to find enough space for their work.

The name of St. Pauli&#x27;s most famous street Reeperbahn, or &quot;Rope Walk,&quot; harkens back to its rope-making past. When people were officially allowed to live in St. Pauli at the end of the 17th century the city government moved workhouses and (pestilence) hospitals out of the city to &#x27;Hamburger Berg,&#x27; which later was named after its still existing church, &#x27;St. Pauli&#x27; (Saint Paul). St. Pauli was mainly used by sailors for entertainment during their stay in Hamburg and Altona. To this day it is known as the &quot;sinful mile,&quot; combining the upper and lower standards of entertainment, from musicals, theaters, to bars and clubs, as well as the most known red light district.

There have been various social issues and conflicts during the last decades, including the Hafenstraße, Rote Flora and Bambule.
===Chinatown===

Hamburg, as a major port city, has very close ties to China and Asia in general. Since around 1890, it was home to the &quot;Chinesenviertel&quot; Chinatown area within its St. Pauli district (around &quot;Schmuckstrasse&quot;), which was shut down by the Nazis in the 1930s. The St. Pauli Chinatown has been reestablishing itself since the 2010s. The city of Hamburg also hosts the biennial high-level conference &quot;Hamburg Summit: China meets Europe&quot;, has a major Chinese consulate at Elbchaussee 268 in Othmarschen since 1921, and has Shanghai as a sister city. A large contingent of Chinese and other Asian immigrants continue to live in the St. Pauli and Altona districts, while new arrivals also gravitate to this part of the city.

==Politics==
These are the results of St. Pauli in the Hamburg state election:

==Geography==
It is situated directly on the north bank of the Elbe river close to the port of Hamburg. It is located south of Eimsbüttel, west of Hamburg-Neustadt and east of Altona. According to the statistical office of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, the quarter has a total area of .

==Demographics==
St. Pauli has 27,612 inhabitants in more than 17,000 households. Immigrants were 27.9% of the population. There were 11.9% with children under the age of 18 and 9.3% of the inhabitants were 65 years of age or older. 63.4% of all households were made up of individuals.

==Education==
The Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNI) is located in the Bernhard Nocht Straße 7. It is a research center for tropical and infectious diseases and provides an information center about health risks, vaccinations and medical data about other countries for tourism and travel advice. The research facility formerly located in the Bernhard Nocht Straße hospital is now in the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), Martinistraße 52. BNI website

In 2006 there were two elementary schools and a secondary school in St. Pauli.

==Culture, sports and recreation==

A prominent symbol is its football club, FC St. Pauli and the Millerntor-Stadion. The club played host to the inaugural FIFI Wild Cup in May–June 2006. In 2010, FC St. Pauli celebrated its centenary. For the jubilee the fan club &quot;18auf12&quot; recorded a song: &quot;One Hundred Beers&quot; (Words and music by Henning Knorr &amp; Christoph Brüx).

St. Pauli has a long tradition as a recreation and amusement center. The big port of Hamburg led many sailors to Hamburg who preferred to spend their spare time (while their ships were unloaded and loaded again) in this area. Since then there has been prostitution in St. Pauli, and it is still best known as Hamburg&#x27;s red-light district. The red-light district is an area of a few streets around the Reeperbahn, often referred to as the &quot;Kiez&quot;.

Bars and music clubs have a tradition in the &quot;Kiez St. Pauli&quot;. The Beatles lived in St. Pauli and played at the Star-Club before becoming famous. They were honored with the naming of Beatles-Platz square. Actor/singer Hans Albers is strongly associated with St. Pauli, providing the neighborhood&#x27;s unofficial anthem, with &quot;Auf der Reeperbahn Nachts um Halb Eins&quot; (&quot;On the Reeperbahn at Half Past Midnight&quot;) from the movie . The square of Hans-Albers-Platz near Reeperbahn was named after him.

The district is referenced in the song &quot;St Pauli&quot; by Art Brut, which also contains the lyrics &quot;Punk rock ist nicht tot&quot; (&quot;punk rock is not dead&quot;).

The Swedish post-industrial rock band Sällskapet&#x27;s song Nordlicht talks about a pub in the area. The song contains detailed instructions supposedly leading to the location of the pub.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2012 counted St. Pauli as one of the five best places to live in the world.

<text>The European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup, also known as Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens, or simply the European Cup, is a trophy awarded annually by UEFA to the football club that wins the UEFA Champions League. The competition in its older format shared its name with the trophy, being also known as the &quot;European Cup&quot;, before being renamed for the 1992–93 season onwards.

There have been several official incarnations of this trophy, as a club was entitled to keep the cup after five wins or three consecutive wins, with a new cup having to be forged for the following season. During the first years of the competition, up until 1966–67 season, the trophy had a distinctively different design.

==The trophy==


The original European Cup trophy was donated by &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, a French sports newspaper. This trophy was awarded permanently to Real Madrid in March 1967. At the time, they were the reigning champions, and had won six titles altogether, including the first five competitions from 1956 to 1960. Celtic therefore became the first club to win the cup in its current design in 1967.

The replacement trophy, with a somewhat different design from the original, was commissioned by UEFA from Jörg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland. At a cost of 10,000 Swiss francs, it was silver, 74 cm high, weighing 11 kg. Subsequent replacement trophies have replicated this design. The shape of the handles have earned it the nickname of &quot;big ears&quot; in multiple languages, including French (&quot;&quot;la Coupe aux grandes oreilles&quot;), Italian (&quot;La Coppa dalle grandi orecchie&quot;), Spanish (&quot;La Orejona&quot;), Russian (&quot;Ушастый, Ushastiy&quot;), Vietnamese (&quot;Cúp tai voi&quot;&quot;), Chinese (&quot;大耳朵杯&quot;) and Arabic (&quot;كأس ذات الأذنين&quot;). Between 1967 and 1994, the trophy bears the title &quot;Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens&quot; in sentence case; AC Milan were the last team to win this type of trophy. Since then, the trophy bears the title fully in capital letters, although the size is increased in the subsequent and current trophy.

The trophy that currently is awarded is the sixth and has been in use since 2006, after Liverpool won their fifth European Cup in 2005. Since 2009, Champions League winners have not kept the real trophy, which remains in UEFA&#x27;s custody at all times. A full-size replica trophy, the &quot;Champions League winners trophy&quot;, is awarded to the winning club with their name engraved on it. Winning clubs are permitted to make replicas of their own. They must be clearly marked as such and can be a maximum of eighty percent the size of the actual trophy.

===Clubs awarded the trophy permanently===
A rule introduced before the 1968–69 season allowed a club to keep the original trophy after five wins or three consecutive wins. At that point, Real Madrid was the only club meeting either qualification, and indeed met both. Once a club had been awarded the trophy, their count would be reset to zero.

Five clubs have been permanently awarded the real trophy under the old rules, from the 1968–69 to 2008–09 seasons:
* Real Madrid, after their sixth title in 1966.
* Ajax, after their third consecutive title in 1973.
* Bayern Munich, after their third consecutive title in 1976.
* Milan, after their fifth title in 1994.
* Liverpool, after their fifth title in 2005.

Prior to 2008-09, a club whose Champions League title was not a fifth overall or third consecutive win kept the real trophy for ten months after their victory and received a scaled-down replica to keep permanently.

===Multiple-winner badge===

The &quot;multiple-winner badge&quot;, sometimes called &quot;badge of honour&quot;, was introduced for the start of the 2000–01 competition for clubs that kept the trophy permanently. The badge is worn on the left sleeve of the team&#x27;s shirt during Champions League matches. The original badge was a blue oval on which was an outline of the current trophy in white, overlaid with part of the Champions League starball logo. Above the trophy was the number of titles won by the club. At the start of 2012–13 competition, the badge became grey with a new design, which was used until the end of the 2020–21 season.

Starting with 2021–22, UEFA abolished the badge&#x27;s use on the left sleeve, allowing for sleeve sponsors, and incorporated the badge into the regular &quot;Starball Badge&quot;, with the number of victories placed on top of the middle star. Other teams wear the same badge but without any numbers. Additionally, title holders with three consecutive or five overall wins have their number of victories etched onto the title-holder logo, with the starball scrapped, while holders that do not have a right to wear the multiple-winner badge sport an empty blue title holder logo.

Although the trophy is no longer given to a team that wins a fifth overall or third consecutive title, the multiple-winner badge is still awarded to such clubs.

Six teams have won five overall or three consecutive titles, and thus can wear the multiple-winner badge:

* Real Madrid (3 consecutive -two times-, 15 overall)
* Milan (7 overall)
* Bayern Munich (3 consecutive, 6 overall)
* Liverpool (6 overall)
* Barcelona (5 overall)
* Ajax (3 consecutive, 4 overall)

===Title-holder logo===
A separate &quot;title-holder logo&quot; is worn by the reigning Champions League champions in the following season&#x27;s competition in place of the regular patch worn by the other competing teams. The logo is predominantly dark blue and was introduced in 2004–05, with Porto as the defending champions. From 2006–07 to 2010–11, the title holders also played with the match ball used in their winning final in their home matches, but from 2011–12, the title holders use the same match ball as the 31 other teams.
The original design for the title-holder badge featured two of the interconnecting stars of the competition&#x27;s star ball logo at the top, with the caption &quot;champions&quot; and the season of triumph in the centre of the badge. It was slightly modified in 2008–09 to feature the entirety of the star ball logo, with the other stars faded out, and it was drastically changed for the 2009–10 competition. Without the star ball background, it instead featured a design of the trophy which was used for the branding of the previous season&#x27;s final.

It was revamped again in 2010–11 to feature part of the star ball on show below the &quot;champions&quot; caption and the year of triumph. A replaced design was first worn by Chelsea in 2012–13; it featured an outline design of the trophy along with the year, the same design was kept from 2015–16 for the logo, but the material used on the logo was changed. Starting with the 2021–22 competition, reigning champions wear a new logo, which still keeps the same design, but is grey and no longer keeps the championship year in it. In case the title holder also wears a multiple-winner badge, the number of victories is incorporated in the logo which is used in place of the starball.

<doc id="535923" wikidata="Q687702" url="?curid=535923" title="Mowag Piranha">
<text>The Mowag Piranha is a family of armoured fighting vehicles designed by the Swiss company Mowag (since 2010 General Dynamics European Land Systems – Mowag GmbH).

Five generations of vehicles have been produced, manufactured by Mowag or under licence by other companies such as the LAV, and variants are in service with military forces throughout the world.

==Variants==
Piranhas are available in 4×4, 6×6, 8×8, and 10×10 wheel versions. There are several variants within these versions, giving different degrees of armour protection and several kinds of turret, for use in a variety of roles. Piranha derivatives have been assigned roles as troop transports, command vehicles, fire support vehicles, tank trainers, and police vehicles.

Piranhas are used by the Swiss Army. Swiss-built Piranha derivatives have been exported to Ireland, Romania, Spain, and Belgium. The Romanian and Belgian armies have selected the Piranha IIIC 8×8. Belgium converted to an all-wheeled force, and replaced all their M113 armoured personnel carriers, AIFVs and Leopard 1 tanks with 268 Piranha IIIC in 7 variants.

Piranha derivatives have been manufactured under license by General Dynamics (Canada), BAE Systems Land Systems (UK), Cardoen and FAMAE (Chile), and in the USA.

A new Piranha V version, weighing between 25 and 30 tons, was announced as the provisional winner of the British Army&#x27;s Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) program in May 2008, but this selection was reversed seven months later and bidding started again.

General Dynamics European Land Systems launched their new Piranha Class 5 at Eurosatory 2010 on 15 June and it was reported that the British MoD were showing renewed interest, but struggling with budget constraints.

===Piranha 4×4 IB===
The MOWAG Piranha 4×4 IB was an armored personnel carrier.

To complete the Piranha I Family of 1974, the Piranha 4×4 IB was designed as a light rapid reconnaissance and attack vehicle. It could take part in amphibious operations thanks to twin propellers and could operate in NBC-contaminated areas. The Piranha 4×4 was also designed to meet police needs. The MOWAG Grenadier and Mowag Spy sub-versions were also developed. The prototype of the Piranha 4×4 IB went through numerous tests and received different equipment and different engines. Due to rapid technological development and adjustments to requirements for military vehicles, no Piranha with gasoline engine was sold. The prototype is now in the Schweizerisches Militärmuseum Full.

===Piranha IB 6×6===

The first Piranha prototype ever built was the 6×6 IB in 1972. It can be seen as a milestone for the Piranha series due to various technical innovation like (at the time) modern designed drive with independent suspension, compact power unit in the right front and (as an amphibian drive) being powered by two propellers. This prototype was demonstrated with different engines and features for potential customers such as the Canadian Army who locally produced them as the AVGP. Switzerland sold a license to manufacture this machine to Chile in 1983. In the Swiss Army, the Piranha 6×6 is used as an ambulance, C3 command vehicle and, together with the BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missile, as a &quot;tank destroyer&quot;. The prototype is along with an ambulance Piranha 6×6 on display in the Schweizerisches Militärmuseum Full.

===MOWAG Piranha IIIC 10×10===
With the continuous evolution of the Piranha family due to increasing demands, and the projected development of the Mowag Shark as a heavy weapons carrier, the Piranha design reached the limit of its payload capacity. The Piranha 10×10 (built in 1994), was an attempt to expand the payload, using a 5th axle of the same type as used in the smaller Piranha models. The Piranha 10×10 was designed as a heavy weapons carrier, but only a small number were built for Sweden as the LIRKA command tank and Kapris radar carrier. The Piranha IIIC 10×10 marked an important development from the Piranha IIIC 8×8. The Piranha IIIC 10×10 prototype was used in various tests, including in Sweden, and now stands in the &quot;Schweizerisches Militärmuseum Full&quot;.

<text>Spiritual evolution, also called higher evolution, is the idea that the mind or spirit, in analogy to biological evolution, collectively evolves from a simple form dominated by nature, to a higher form dominated by the spiritual or divine. It is differentiated from the &quot;lower&quot; or biological evolution.

==Definition==

An alternate term is &quot;Higher Evolution.&quot; According to Piyasīlo,
The concept of spiritual evolution is teleological, in contrast to biological evolution.

==Origins of the concept==

===Evolution===
===Hegel===

===Western esotericism===

Theories of spiritual evolution are important in many Occult and Esoteric teachings, which emphasise the progression and development of the individual either after death (spiritualism) or through successive reincarnations (Theosophy, Hermeticism).

====The great chain of being====
The concept of the Great Chain of Being was developed by Plato and Aristotle whose ideas were taken up and synthesised by Plotinus. Plotinus in turn heavily influenced Augustine&#x27;s theology, and from there Aquinas and the Scholastics. The Great Chain of Being was an important theme in Renaissance and Elizabethan thought, had an under-acknowledged influence on the shaping of the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and played a large part in the worldview of 18th century Europe. And while essentially a static worldview, by the 18th and early 19th century it had been &quot;temporalized&quot; by the concept of the soul ascending or progressing spiritually through the successive rungs or stages, and thus growing or evolving closer to God. It also had at this time an impact on theories of biological evolution.

E. F. Schumacher, author of &quot;Small is Beautiful&quot;, has recently proposed a sort of simplified Great Chain of Being, based on the idea of four &quot;kingdoms&quot; (mineral, vegetable, animal, human). Schumacher rejects modernist and scientific themes, his approach recalling the universalist orientation of writers like Huston Smith, and likely contributing to Ken Wilber&#x27;s &quot;holonomic&quot; hierarchy or &quot;Great Nest of Being&quot;.

====Spiritualism====
Spiritualists reacted with uncertainty to the theories of evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking, the concept of evolution fit the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time, however, a belief in the animal origins of man threatened the foundation of the immortality of the spirit, for if man had not been created, it was scarcely plausible that he would be specially endowed with a spirit. This led to spiritualists embracing spiritual evolution.

In the 19th century, Anglo-American Spiritualist ideas emphasized the progression of the soul after death to higher states of existence, in contrast to Spiritism which admits to reincarnation.

Spiritualism taught that after death, spirits progressed to new spheres of existence. According to this idea, evolution occurred in the spirit world “at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favorable to growth” than encountered on earth.

The biologist and spiritualist Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913) believed that qualitative novelties could arise through the process of spiritual evolution, in particular, the phenomena of life and mind. Wallace attributed these novelties to a supernatural agency. Later in his life, Wallace was an advocate of spiritualism and believed in an origin for the higher mental faculties of humans. He believed that evolution suggested the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes. In a 1909 magazine article entitled &quot;The World of Life&quot;, which he later expanded into a book of the same name Wallace argued in his 1911 book &quot;World of life&quot; for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as “creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose”. Wallace believed natural selection could not explain intelligence or morality in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of man could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate “in the unseen universe of spirit”.

Robert Broom in his book &quot;The Coming of Man: Was it Accident or Design?&quot; (1933) claimed that &quot;spiritual agencies&quot; had guided evolution as animals and plants were too complex to have arisen by chance. According to Broom there were at least two different kinds of spiritual forces, and psychics are capable of seeing them. Broom claimed there was a plan and purpose in evolution and that the origin of Homo sapiens is the ultimate purpose behind evolution. According to Broom &quot;Much of evolution looks as if it had been planned to result in man, and in other animals and plants to make the world a suitable place for him to dwell in.

The Anglo-American position recalls (and is presumably inspired by) 18th century concepts regarding the temporalization of The Great Chain of Being. Spiritual evolution, rather than being a physical (or physico-spiritual) process is based on the idea of realms or stages through which the soul or spirit passes in a non-temporal, qualitative way. This is still an important part of some spiritualist ideas today, and is similar to some mainline (as opposed to fundamentalist) Protestant Christian beliefs, according to which after death the person goes to &quot;summerland&quot; (see Spirit world)

====Theosophical conceptions====

Theosophy presents a more sophisticated and complex cosmology than Spiritualism, although coming out of the same general milieu. H. P. Blavatsky developed a highly original cosmology, according to which the human race (both collectively and through the succession of individual reincarnation and spiritual evolution) passes through a number of Root Races, beginning with the huge ethereal and mindless Polarian or First Root Race, through the Lemurian (3rd), Atlantean (4th) and our present &quot;Aryan&quot; 5th Race. This will give rise to a future, Post-Aryan 6th Root Race of highly spiritual and enlightened beings that will arise in Baja California in the 28th century, and an even more sublime 7th Root Race, before ascending to totally superhuman and cosmic states of existence.

Blavatsky&#x27;s ideas were further developed by her successors, such as C.W. Leadbeater, Rudolf Steiner, Alice Bailey, Benjamin Creme, and Victor Skumin each of whom went into huge detail in constructing baroque cycles of rounds, races, and sub-races. 
Skumin elaborated on the theosophical conceptions of spiritual evolution and proposed (1990) a classification of Homo spiritalis (Latin: &quot;spiritual man&quot;), the sixth root race, consisting of eight subraces: HS0 Anabiosis spiritalis, HS1 Scientella spiritalis, HS2 Aurora spiritalis, HS3 Ascensus spiritalis, HS4 Vocatus spiritalis, HS5 Illuminatio spiritalis, НS6 Creatio spiritalis, and HS7 Servitus spiritalis. According to Skumin:

Although including elements of the science of her day as well as both eastern and western esoteric thought, Blavatsky rejected the Darwinian idea that man evolved from apes, and most subsequent esotericists followed this lead. Darwinism, with its explanation of evolution through material factors like natural selection and random mutation, does not sit well with many spiritual evolutionists, for whom evolution is initiated or guided by metaphysical principles or is tending towards a final spiritual or divine state. It is believed by Theosophists that humans are evolving &quot;spiritually&quot; through a series of esoteric initiations and in the future humans will become esoteric masters themselves as their souls gradually rise upward through the spiritual hierarchy over the course of eons as they reincarnate.

Despite this, recent Theosophists and Anthroposophists have tried to incorporate the facts of geology and paleontology into their cosmology and spiritual evolution (in Anthroposophy Hermann Poppelbaum is a particularly creative thinker in this regard). Some have attempted to equate Lemuria with Gondwanaland, for example. Today all these ideas have little influence outside their specialised followings, but for a time Theosophical concepts were immensely influential. Theosophy-like teachings also continue today in a group of religions based on Theosophy called the Ascended Master Teachings.

====Rosicrucians====
Rosicrucians view the world as a training school, which posits that while mistakes are made in life, humans often learn more from mistakes than successes. Suffering is considered as merely the result of error, and the impact of suffering on the consciousness causes humans to be active along other lines which are found to be good, in harmony with nature. Humans are seen as spirits attending the school of life for the purpose of unfolding latent spiritual power, developing themselves from &quot;impotence&quot; to omnipotence (related also to development from innocence into virtue), reaching the stage of creative gods at the end of mankind&#x27;s present evolution: &quot;Great Day of Manifestation&quot;.

In esoteric spirituality epigenesis it is the idea that since the mind was given to the human being, it is the original creative impulse which has been the cause of all of mankind&#x27;s development. According to this approach, humans build upon that which has already been created, but add new elements because of the activity of the spirit. Humans have the capacity, therefore, to become creative intelligences—creators. For a human to fulfill this promise, his training should allow for the exercise of originality, which distinguishes creation from imitation. When epigenesis becomes inactive, in the individual or even in a race, evolution ceases and degeneration commences.

===Neo-Vedanta===
According to Gosling, Swami Vivekananda based most of his cosmological and biological ideas on Samkhya. Influenced by western thought and esotericism, Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo developed a view on reincarnation in which an involution of the Divine into matter takes place, and the person has to evolve over multiple lives until the Divine gains recognition of its true nature and liberation is attained.

Samkhya is one of the six systems of Hindu philosophy; proto-Samkhya ideas can be found in the Upanishads, Jainism, and Buddhism. Samkhya posits two ontological entities, &quot;Purusha&quot; (witness-consciousness) and &quot;prakriti&quot; (&#x27;nature&#x27;), which includes mind, congnition, and the perceived objects). According to Samkhya, when &quot;purusha&quot; comes into proximity with &quot;prakriti&quot; it disturbs the equilibrium of &quot;prakriti&quot;. As a result, a number of successive essences called &quot;tattvas&quot; evolve from &quot;prakriti&quot;. The most subtle tattwas emerge first, then progressively grosser ones, each in a particular order, and finally the elements and the organs of sense. Adherents of samkhya-Yoga adhere to the release of purusha from &quot;prakriti&quot;, and the return of &quot;prakriti&quot; to the unmanifest condition.

Sri Aurobindo and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin both describe a progression from inanimate matter to a future state of Divine consciousness. Teilhard de Chardin refers to this as the Omega Point, and Sri Aurobindo as the Supermind.

Teilhard, who was a Jesuit Paleontologist who played an important role in the discovery of Peking Man, presented a teleological view of planetary and cosmic evolution, according to which the formation of atoms, molecules and inanimate matter is followed by the development of the biosphere and organic evolution, then the appearance of man and the noosphere as the total envelope of human thought. According to Teilhard evolution does not cease here but continues on to its culmination and unification in the Omega Point, which he identifies with Christ.

===New Age===
New Age thought is strongly syncretic. A common theme is the evolution or the transcendence of the human or collective planetary consciousness in a higher state or higher &quot;vibratory&quot; (a metaphor taken from G. I. Gurdjieff) level.

David Spangler&#x27;s communications speak of a &quot;New Heaven and a new Earth&quot;, while Christopher Hills refers (perhaps influenced by Sri Aurobindo) to
the divinization of man.

&quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; narrated the idea of evolution in a fascinating fashion. James Redfield in his novel &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; suggested that through experiencing a series of personal spiritual insights, humanity is becoming aware of the connection between our evolution and the Divine. More recently in his book &quot;God and the Evolving Universe: The Next Step in Personal Evolution&quot; (2002) co-written with Michael Murphy, he claims that humanity is on the verge of undergoing a change in consciousness.

It is also known as the path of Ascension.

==Stage theory==
The idea of a spiritual evolution finds contemporary expression in a number of stage theories, inspired by Sri Aurobindo, Jean Gebser, and Piaget, among others. In these models, human development, both individual and collectively, is conceptualized as going through a number of structural stages, from the primitive psychophysical genesis to the full-grown rational, cognitive and moral abilities, and beyond to transpersonal stages in which unconscious drives are fully recognized and integrated, and the sense of a separate identity is loosened or abandoned.

===Jean Gebser===
===Spiral dynamics===

An interpretation of social and psychological development that could also be considered a theory of spiritual evolution is spiral dynamics, based on the work of Clare W. Graves. Spiral Dynamics posits a series of stages through which human&#x27;s cultural development progresses – from a survival-based hunter-gatherer stage to a magical-tribal-agrarian stage to a city-building-invading stage to a mythic-religious-empire stage to a rational-scientific-capitalist stage to a green-holistic-inclusive stage and then ascending to a second tier where all the previous stages are contemplated and integrated and a third transpersonal tier where a spiritual unity or Omega point is eventually reached, which all the other stages are struggling to embody. He feels that individuals in each of the meme-plexes/stages can ascend to the peak of consciousness – these being the prophets, visionaries and leaders of any region/age.

===Ken Wilber===
More recently the concept of spiritual evolution has been given a sort of respectability it has not had since the early 19th century through the work of the integral theorist Ken Wilber, in whose writings both the cosmological and the personal dimensions are described. In this integral philosophy (inspired in part by the works of Plotinus, Hegel, Sri Aurobindo, Eric Jantsch, and many others) reality is said to consist of several realms or stages, including more than one of the following: the physical, the vital, the psychic, (after the Greek &quot;psyche&quot;, &quot;soul&quot;), the causal (referring to &quot;that which causes, or gives rise to, the manifest world&quot;), and the ultimate (or non-dual), through which the individual progressively evolves. Although this schema is derived in large part from Tibetan Buddhism, Wilber argues (and uses many tables of diagrams to show) that these same levels of being are common to all wisdom teachings. Described simplistically, Wilber sees humans developing through several stages, including magic, mythic, pluralistic, and holistic mentalities. But he also sees cultures as developing through these stages. And, much like Hegel, he sees this development of individuals and cultures &quot;as&quot; the evolution of existence itself. Wilber has also teamed up with Don Beck to integrate Spiral Dynamics into his own Integral philosophy, and vice versa.

<text>Fort Leavenworth () is a United States Army installation located in Leavenworth County, Kansas, in the city of Leavenworth. Built in 1827, it is the second oldest active United States Army post west of Washington, D.C., and the oldest permanent settlement in Kansas. Fort Leavenworth has been historically known as the &quot;Intellectual Center of the Army.&quot;

During the country&#x27;s westward expansion, Fort Leavenworth was a forward destination for thousands of soldiers, surveyors, immigrants, American Indians, preachers and settlers who passed through.

Today, the garrison supports the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) by managing and maintaining the home of the US Army Combined Arms Center (CAC). CAC&#x27;s mission involves leader development, collective training, and Army doctrine and battle command (current and future).

Fort Leavenworth is also home to the Military Corrections Complex, consisting of the United States Disciplinary Barracks the Department of Defense&#x27;s only maximum security prison and the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility. In addition, the Fort Leavenworth Garrison supports numerous tenant organizations that directly and indirectly relate to the functions of the CAC, including the United States Army Command and General Staff College and the Foreign Military Studies Office.

The fort occupies and has of floor area in 1,000 buildings and 1,500 quarters. It is located on the Frontier Military Scenic Byway (U.S. Route 69 and K-7 corridor), which was originally a military road connecting to Fort Scott and Fort Gibson.

Fort Leavenworth was also the base of African-American soldiers of the U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army, formed on 21 September 1866 at Fort Leavenworth. They became known as Buffalo Soldiers, nicknamed by the Native American tribes whom they fought. The term eventually was applied to all of the African-American regiments formed in 1866.

==Tenants and organization==

The garrison commander is a colonel reporting via IMCOM West to the Installation Management Command. The fort is nicknamed the &quot;intellectual center&quot; of the Army because much of its mission involves training.

Major tenants include:
* United States Army Combined Arms Center (CAC) which, among its various responsibilities, is the United States Army Command and General Staff College, which includes a degrees granting graduate school for U.S. and allied soldiers and officers. The school trains almost all of the army&#x27;s majors. All modern five-star army generals have passed through the college including George Marshall, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight Eisenhower, Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, and Omar Bradley. Since 1978 it has been commanded by a lieutenant general (3 stars). In 2007, its commander was David Petraeus. It reports to the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC).
* United States Disciplinary Barracks, which is the only maximum security prison for military personnel of all branches. Since a 2007 reorganization, its commander is a colonel who reports to the United States Army Corrections Command.
* Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility, a low security prison. reports to the United States Army Corrections Command.
* Foreign Military Studies Office (which reports to TRADOC)
* Munson Army Health Center (Post hospital)
* University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies (which includes teaching Red Teams among its courses)
* Sherman Army Airfield—the Post airport (which reports to the garrison)
* Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery
* TRADOC Analysis Center (which reports to TRADOC)
* Headquarters of the National Guard&#x27;s 35th Infantry Division (Mechanized)
* Mission Command Training Program is the focal point for National Guard of the United States division and brigade staff training and development.
* Army/ACE Registry Transcript Systems (handles transcripts for all its training)

==Schools==
Fort Leavenworth School District operates schools for grades PreK-8. High school students go to Leavenworth High School of Leavenworth USD 453.

==Media==
&quot;The Fort Leavenworth Lamp&quot; newspaper served the military community living on post since 1971. 

==History==
===18th century===
The fort is 10 miles south of the 18th century French Fort de Cavagnal, which was the farthest west fort in Louisiana (New France). Its commandant was François Coulon de Villiers, a brother to Louis Coulon de Villiers, who was the only military commander to force George Washington to surrender (after avenging the murder of his half brother Joseph Coulon de Jumonville while in Washington&#x27;s custody, which was the incident that set off the French and Indian War).

The French abandoned the fort after ceding its territory to Louisiana (New Spain) at the conclusion of the French and Indian War.

Early American explorers on the Missouri River to visit the area of Fort de Cavagnal include Lewis and Clark on 26–29 June 1804 and Stephen Harriman Long in 1819.

The fort location had been chosen then because of its proximity to a large Kansa tribe village.

=== 19th century ===
Colonel Henry Leavenworth, with the officers and men of the 3rd Infantry Regiment from Jefferson Barracks at St. Louis, Missouri, established Fort Leavenworth in 1827 to be a forward base protecting the Santa Fe Trail.

Leavenworth&#x27;s instructions had been the following:

Colonel Leavenworth of the 3d Infantry, with four companies of his regiment will ascend the Missouri and when he reaches a point on its left band near the mouth of Little Platte River and within a range of twenty miles above or below its confluence, he will select such position as in his judgment is best calculated for the site of a permanent cantonment. The spot being chosen, he will then construct with the troops of his command comfortable, though temporary quarters sufficient for the accommodation of four companies. This movement will be made as early as the convenience of the service will permit.
Leavenworth was to report that spot around the confluence on the east side of the Missouri River (near present-day Farley, Missouri) would be prone to flooding and on 8 May 1827 recommended the location upstream on the west bank in the bluffs above the river.

The first army installation in Cantonment Leavenworth (its original name) was located on Scott Avenue, south of the Post Chapel with initial strength of 14 officers and 174 enlisted men.

The Cantonment almost immediately increased in importance as it became the eastern terminus for the Santa Fe Trail and Oregon Trail. After Indian Removal Act of 1830 attempted to remove all Indians west of the Missouri–Kansas border, the fort which is west of the border assumed even more importance. In 1832, it was renamed &quot;Fort Leavenworth&quot;.

Between 1832 and 1834, the Rookery was built as bachelor officer quarters. The Rookery is the oldest building in Kansas and would be the office of the first territorial governor and thus the first capitol in Kansas from 1854 to 1855 when the capitol was moved to Pawnee, Kansas.

In 1836, William Clark at the fort presided over the transfer of Indian land directly across the Missouri River from the fort to the U.S. government in the Platte Purchase which involved the entire northwest corner of Missouri.

In 1839, Col. Stephen W. Kearny marched against the Cherokees with 20 companies of dragoons, the largest U.S. mounted force ever assembled. Throughout the Mexican–American War, Fort Leavenworth was the outfitting post for the Army of the West.

In 1854, Kansas Territory Governor Andrew Reeder set up executive offices on post and lived for a short time in the quarters now known as the Rookery.

During the 1850s, troops from Ft. Leavenworth were mobilized to control the &quot;Mormon Problem&quot; in what became known as the Utah War.
From 1858 to 1874 Fort Leavenworth was also home to the Fort Leavenworth Arsenal (originally called the Leavenworth Ordnance Depot) which supplied ordnance to the army in the western United States which was located at what today is the Combined Arms Center headquarters complex on what is called Arsenal Hill which was reached by Arsenal Avenue (which today is called Scott Avenue). The arsenal moved in 1874 to the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois. Two surviving buildings from the arsenal are Sherman Hall and Sheridan Hall which are now in the same complex as Grant Hall and are among the most iconic buildings of the fort.

===Civil War===
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Camp Lincoln was established on post as a reception and training station for Kansas volunteers. In 1864, news of the approach of Confederate General Sterling Price prompted construction of Fort Sully, a series of earthworks for artillery emplacements on Hancock Hill, overlooking what is now the Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery. (See Fort Sully (Fort Leavenworth)). However, Price&#x27;s forces never reached Fort Leavenworth, having met defeat at Westport, which is now part of Kansas City. During its long history, the post was never subject to enemy attack.

For three decades following the war, the Army&#x27;s chief mission was control of the American Indian tribes on the Western plains. Between 1865 and 1891, the Army had more than 1,000 combat engagements with Apache, Modoc, Cheyenne, Ute, Nez Perce, Comanche, Kiowa, Kickapoo and other tribes.

The Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery is one of the national cemeteries established by Abraham Lincoln on 17 July 1862. Veterans since the War of 1812 have been laid to rest in the cemetery. One veteran of the War of 1812 is the cemetery&#x27;s most famous occupant, Brigadier General Henry Leavenworth, who gave his name to the fort, the cemetery, and the town and county they are located in. Others buried in the cemetery include 10 Medal of Honor recipients, seven Confederate prisoners of war as well as soldiers killed in Operation Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Although there is no longer space for new burial sites, burials frequently take place for those who already have family members interred in the cemetery.

===Reconstruction and Indian wars===
In 1866, the U.S. Congress authorized the formation of four black regiments, which were the 24th and 25th Infantry Regiments and the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments. The 10th Cavalry Regiment was formed at Fort Leavenworth under the command of Col. Benjamin Grierson. Today, a statue of a cavalry rider stands at Fort Leavenworth in tribute to the &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot; of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments. Just off Fort Leavenworth in the City of Leavenworth, The Richard Allen Cultural Center, housed in a former home of a Buffalo Soldier, also highlights the history of the Buffalo Soldiers and African-Americans serving in the U.S. Army.

The United States Disciplinary Barracks, now a maximum-security military prison, was established in 1875 under the command of Lt. Col. Edmund Rice.

In 1877 some 400 Nez Perce were shipped to Fort Leavenworth after being pursued and captured in the Nez Perce War. In 1889 they were sent to Tonkawa, Oklahoma.

The fort&#x27;s first Catholic church was built in 1871 and was later replaced by St. Ignatius Chapel in 1889. St. Ignatius Chapel was destroyed by fire in December 2001. The first Protestant chapel, Memorial Chapel, was built by prison labor in 1878 of stone quarried on post. The round window behind the chapel&#x27;s front altar was intentionally installed slightly askew by an inmate who was angry at his work boss. This chapel has brass cannon embedded in the walls at the sides of the church, and photos of many of the officers involved in the early history of the fort, including some of the Custer family.

In 1881, Gen. William T. Sherman established the School of Application for Cavalry and Infantry. That school evolved into the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.

The Western Branch National Military Home (&quot;old soldiers&#x27; home&quot;), now called the Veterans Medical Center, or Dwight D. Eisenhower Medical Center Historic District was established in 1885 as part of the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers system. The soldier home is closely associated with the nearby cemetery that became the Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery in 1973.

===20th century===
World War I was the first opportunity to evaluate the impact of Sherman&#x27;s school. Graduates excelled in planning complex American Expeditionary Forces operations. By the end of the war, they dominated staffs throughout the AEF.

In the years between the world wars, graduates included such officers as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Omar Bradley and George S. Patton. During World War II, some 19,000 officers completed various courses at Fort Leavenworth. By the end of 1943, commanders and staffs of 26 infantry, airborne and cavalry divisions had trained as teams at the school.

General Michael Joe Costello of the army of the newly formed Irish Free State attended Fort Leavenworth from 1926 to 1927, passing with such distinction that he was recommended for the United States Army War College.

In 1946, the school was given its current name. In 1959, the college moved to the newly built J. Franklin Bell Hall on Arsenal Hill. In 1985, the Harold Keith Johnson wing was added to house the Combined Arms and Services Staff School (CAS3). Classes for the School of Advanced Military Studies and the School for Command Preparation, as well as the Combined Arms Research Library, are located in Eisenhower Hall which was dedicated in 1994.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960.

Until the early 1970s, a battery of four Nike-Hercules Missiles were deployed at Bell Point on a hill on the west side of the fort.

The base is served by the Sherman Army Airfield which has a runway and operates under a joint agreement with the city of Leavenworth, Kansas that permits civilian aircraft to use it all hours. The airfield was inundated by the Missouri River in levee breaches during the Great Flood of 1951, the Great Flood of 1993, and the Great Flood of 2011.

==Freedom&#x27;s Frontier Heritage Area==
Fort Leavenworth is considered one of the most significant historic military installations in the Department of the Army, as well as to the nation. The fort&#x27;s 5,634 ac (2,279 ha) contain a 213 ac (86.1 ha) National Historic Landmark District (NHLD), which was established in 1974.

A number of historic preservation investigations have been conducted over the past few decades at Fort Leavenworth. In 1970, for example, two historic sites were listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP): the Main Parade Ground and the Santa Fe Trail Ruts.

During 2006, this historic military site became part of a new Freedom&#x27;s Frontier National Heritage Area.

<text>In antiquity, Paeonia or Paionia () was the land and kingdom of the Paeonians (or Paionians; ).

The exact original boundaries of Paeonia, like the early history of its inhabitants, are obscure, but it is known that it roughly corresponds to most of present-day North Macedonia and north-central parts of Greek Macedonia (i.e. probably the Greek municipalities of Paionia (excluding the village of Evropos), Almopia, Sintiki, Irakleia, and Serres), and a small part of south-western Bulgaria. Ancient authors placed it south of Dardania (an area corresponding to modern-day Kosovo and northern North Macedonia), west of the Thracian mountains, and east of the southernmost Illyrians. It was separated from Dardania by the mountains through which the Vardar river passes from the field of Scupi (modern Skopje) to the valley of Bylazora (near modern Sveti Nikole).

In the Iliad, the Paeonians are portrayed as allies of the Trojans. During the Persian invasion of Greece, the conquered Paeonians from as far as the Lake Prasias, including the Paeoplae and Siropaiones, were deported from Paeonia to Asia.

In 355–354 BC, Philip II of Macedon took advantage of the death of King Agis of Paeonia and campaigned against its northern neighbor in order to conquer it. Subsequently, the southern part of ancient Paeonia was annexed by the ancient kingdom of Macedon and was named &quot;Macedonian Paeonia&quot;; this province included the cities Astraion (modern Strumica), Stenae (near modern Demir Kapija), Antigoneia (near modern Negotino), etc.

== Paeonian people ==

=== Tribes ===

The Paeonian tribes were:
* Agrianes (also, &quot;Agriani&quot; and &quot;Agrii&quot;), it is also claimed that the tribe was Thracian.
* Almopians (also &quot;Almopioi&quot;)
* Laeaeans (also &quot;Laeaei&quot; and &quot;Laiai&quot;)
* Derrones (also &quot;Derroni&quot;), it is also claimed that the tribe was Thracian.
* Odomantes (also &quot;Odomanti&quot;), it is also claimed that the tribe was Thracian. 
* Paeoplae
* Doberes
* Siropaiones

=== Origin ===
There is relatively little mention of the Paeonians in the works of the ancient Greeks. Some modern scholars consider the Paeonians to have been of either Illyrian, Phrygian, Thracian, or of mixed origins. Some Paeonian toponyms and personal names of individual Paeonians are, however, definitely Hellenic (Lycceius, Ariston, Audoleon). Some scholars have proposed a Greek origin. According to Radoslav Katičić, the possibility that the Paeonians took part in the &quot;great Greek migration&quot; and remained behind on the route cannot be ruled out. Linguistically, the very small number of surviving words in the Paeonian language have been variously connected to its neighboring languages – Illyrian and Thracian (and every possible Thraco-Illyrian mix in between), as well as to Greek but with a great deal of Illyrian and Thracian influence as a result of their proximity. Several eastern Paeonian tribes, including the Agrianes, clearly fell within the Thracian sphere of influence. Yet, according to the national legend, they were Teucrian colonists from Troy. Homer speaks of Paeonians from the Axios fighting on the side of the Trojans, but the &quot;Iliad&quot; does not mention whether the Paeonians were kin to the Trojans, and instead connects them to the Phrygians. Herodotus and Thucydides distinguish the Pannonians from the Thracians. Appian wrote of a genealogy in which Paion, the eponym of the Paeonians, is the son of Autarieus, the eponym of the Autariatae, and father of Skordiskos and Triballos, the eponyms of two central Balkanic tribes, one Celtic and the other Thracian. This might connect the Paeonians with the Illyrian complex, although as Katičić suggests, Appian might not refer to the Paeonians but might refer instead to the Pannonians, since Appian uses the Paeonian name to denote that ethnic group as well. Pausanias tells us of another genealogy, which connects the Paeonians with the Peloponnesian Epeians; Paion is said to be the son of Endymion and brother of Epeius and Aitolus. This version, indeed, establishes a Greek affiliation for the Paeonians. Homer calls the Paeonian leader Pyraechmes (parentage unknown); later on in the &quot;Iliad&quot; (Book 21), Homer mentions a second leader, Asteropaeus, son of Pelagon.

Before the reign of Darius Hystaspes, they had made their way as far east as Perinthus in Thrace on the Propontis. At one time all Mygdonia, together with Crestonia, was subject to them. When Xerxes crossed Chalcidice on his way to Therma (later renamed Thessalonica), he is said to have marched through Paeonian territory. They occupied the entire valley of the Axios (Vardar) as far inland as Stobi, the valleys to the east of it as far as the Strymon and the country round Astibus and the river of the same name, with the water of which they anointed their kings. Emathia, roughly the district between the Haliacmon and Axios, was once called Paeonia; and Pieria and Pelagonia were inhabited by Paeonians. As a consequence of the growth of Macedonian power, and under pressure from their Thracian neighbors, their territory was considerably diminished, and in historical times was limited to the north of Macedonia from Illyria to the Strymon.

=== Mythology ===
In Greek mythology, the Paeonians were said to have derived their name from Paeon the son of Endymion. Endymion of Elis, the lover of the goddess of the Moon (Selene), had three sons, Paeon, Epeios and Aetolus. Endymion, in order to give his kingdom to one of them, made them run a race in Olympia, where Epeios won and took the kingdom. Paeon left in disappointment to settle in the Upper Valley of Axios which was since called Paeonia.

In the Trojan War, the Paeonians &quot;with ankylosed bows&quot; (Iliad, II 848-850) &quot;wearing helmets with horsetails&quot; were allies of the Trojans, appearing to fight on their side, under King Pyraichmes and Asteropaeus.

== Paeonian Kingdom ==

In early times, the chief town and seat of the Paeonian kings was Bylazora (in modern Sveti Nikole municipality in North Macedonia) on the Vardar; later, the seat of the kings was moved to Stobi (near modern Gradsko).

Subjugation of the Paeonians happened as a part of Persian military operations initiated by Darius the Great (521–486) in 513 – after immense preparations – a huge Achaemenid army invaded the Balkans and tried to defeat the European Scythians roaming to the north of the Danube river. Darius&#x27; army subjugated several Thracian peoples, and virtually all other regions that touch the European part of the Black Sea, such as parts of nowadays Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and Russia, before it returned to Asia Minor. Darius left in Europe one of his commanders named Megabazus whose task was to accomplish conquests in the Balkans. The Persian troops subjugated gold-rich Thrace, the coastal Greek cities, as well as defeating and conquering the powerful Paeonians.

At some point after the Greco-Persian Wars, the Paeonian princedoms coalesced into a kingdom centred in the central and upper reaches of the Axios and Strymon rivers, corresponding with today&#x27;s northern part of North Macedonia and western Bulgaria. They joined with the Illyrians to attack the northern areas of the Kingdom of Macedonia. The Illyrians, who had a culture of piracy, would have been cut off from some trade routes if movement through this land had been blocked. They unsuccessfully attacked the northern defences of Macedonian territory in an attempt to occupy the region. In 360–359 BC, southern Paeonian tribes were launching raids into Macedon, (Diodorus XVI. 2.5) in support of an Illyrian invasion.

The Macedonian Royal House was thrown into a state of uncertainty by the death of Perdiccas III, but his brother Philip II assumed the throne, reformed the army (providing phalanxes), and proceeded to stop both the Illyrian invasion and the Paeonian raids through the boundary of the &quot;Macedonian Frontier&quot;, which was the northern perimeter which he intended to defend as an area of his domain. He followed Perdiccas&#x27;s success in 358 BC with a campaign deep into the north, into Paeonia itself. This reduced the Paeonian Kingdom (then ruled by Agis) to a semi-autonomous, subordinate status, which led to a process of gradual and formal Hellenization of the Paeonians, who, during the reign of Philip II, began to issue coins with Greek legends like the Macedonian ones. A Paeonian contingent, led by Ariston, was attached to Alexander the Great&#x27;s army.

At the time of the Persian invasion, the Paeonians on the lower Strymon had lost, while those in the north maintained, their territorial integrity. The daughter of Audoleon, a king of Paeonia, was the wife of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, and Alexander the Great wished to bestow the hand of his sister Cynane upon Langarus, king of the Agrianians, who had shown himself loyal to Philip II.

== Culture ==
The Paeonians included several independent tribes, all later united under the rule of a single king. Little is known of their manners and customs. They adopted the cult of Dionysus, known amongst them as &quot;Dyalus&quot; or &quot;Dryalus&quot;, and Herodotus mentions that the Thracian and Paeonian women offered sacrifice to Queen Artemis (probably Bendis). They worshipped the sun in the form of a small round disk fixed on the top of a pole. A passage in Athenaeus seems to indicate the affinity of their language with Mysian. They drank barley beer and various decoctions made from plants and herbs. The country was rich in gold and a bituminous kind of wood (or stone, which burst into a blaze when in contact with water) called (or ).

The scanty remains of the Paeonian language do not allow a firm judgement to be made. On one side are Wilhelm Tomaschek and Paul Kretschmer, who claim it belonged to the Illyrian family, and on the other side is Dimitar Dečev, who claims affinities with Thracian. On the other hand, the Paeonian kings issued coins from the time of Philip II of Macedon onwards, bearing their names written in straightforward Greek. All the names of the Paeonian Kings that have come down to us are, in fact, explainable with and clearly related to Greek (Agis, Ariston, Audoleon, Lycceius, etc.), a fact that, according to Irwin L. Merker, puts into question the theories of Illyrian and Thracian connections.

The women were famous for their industry. In this connection Herodotus tells the story that Darius, having seen at Sardis a beautiful Paeonian woman carrying a pitcher on her head, leading a horse to drink, and spinning flax, all at the same time, inquired who she was. Having been informed that she was a Paeonian, he sent instructions to Megabazus, commander in Thrace, to deport two tribes of the nation without delay to Asia. An inscription, discovered in 1877 at Olympia on the base of a statue, states that it was set up by the community of the Paeonians in honor of their king and founder Dropion. Another king, whose name appears as Lyppeius on a fragment of an inscription found at Athens relating to a treaty of alliance, is no doubt identical with the Lycceius or Lycpeius of Paeonian coins.

== Decline ==
In 280 BC, the Gallic invaders under Brennus ravaged the land of the Paeonians, who, being further hard pressed by the Dardani, had no alternative but to join the Macedonians. Despite their combined efforts, however, the Paeonians and Macedonians were defeated. After the Celtic invasion of the Balkans weakened the state of the Macedonians and Paeonians, the political and military role of the Dardanians began to grow in the region. They expanded their state to the area of Paeonia which definitively disappeared from history. In 230 the Dardani under Longarus captured Bylazora from the Paeonians.
Paeonia consolidated again but, in 217 BC, the Macedonian king Philip V of Macedon (220–179 BC), the son of Demetrius II, succeeded in uniting and incorporating into his empire the separate regions of Dassaretia and Paeonia. A mere 70 years later (in 168 BC), Roman legions conquered Macedon in turn, and a new and much larger Roman province bearing this name was formed. Paeonia around the Axios formed the second and third districts respectively of the newly constituted Roman province of Macedonia. Centuries later under Diocletian, Paeonia and Pelagonia formed a province called Macedonia Secunda or Macedonia Salutaris, belonging to the Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum.

<text>In seed plants, the ovule is the structure that gives rise to and contains the female reproductive cells. It consists of three parts: the &quot;integument&quot;, forming its outer layer, the &quot;nucellus&quot; (or remnant of the megasporangium), and the female gametophyte (formed from a haploid megaspore) in its center. The female gametophyte — specifically termed a &quot;megagametophyte&quot; — is also called the &quot;embryo sac&quot; in angiosperms. The megagametophyte produces an egg cell for the purpose of fertilization. The ovule is a small structure present in the ovary. It is attached to the placenta by a stalk called a funicle. The funicle provides nourishment to the ovule. On the basis of the relative position of micropyle, body of the ovule, chalaza and funicle, there are six types of ovules.

== Location within the plant ==
In flowering plants, the ovule is located inside the portion of the flower called the gynoecium. The ovary of the gynoecium produces one or more ovules and ultimately becomes the fruit wall. Ovules are attached to the placenta in the ovary through a stalk-like structure known as a &quot;funiculus&quot; (plural, funiculi). Different patterns of ovule attachment, or placentation, can be found among plant species, these include:
*Apical placentation: The placenta is at the apex (top) of the ovary. Simple or compound ovary.
*Axile placentation: The ovary is divided into radial segments, with placentas in separate locules. Ventral sutures of carpels meet at the centre of the ovary. Placentae are along fused margins of carpels. Two or more carpels. (e.g. &quot;Hibiscus&quot;, &quot;Citrus&quot;, &quot;Solanum&quot;)
*Basal placentation: The placenta is at the base (bottom) of the ovary on a protrusion of the thalamus (receptacle). Simple or compound carpel, unilocular ovary. (e.g. &quot;Sonchus&quot;, &quot;Helianthus&quot;, &quot;Asteraceae&quot;)
*Free-central placentation: Derived from axile as partitions are absorbed, leaving ovules at the central axis. Compound unilocular ovary. (e.g. &quot;Stellaria&quot;, &quot;Dianthus&quot;)
*Marginal placentation: Simplest type. There is only one elongated placenta on one side of the ovary, as ovules are attached at the fusion line of the carpel&#x27;s margins . This is conspicuous in legumes. Simple carpel, unilocular ovary. (e.g. &quot;Pisum&quot;)
*Parietal placentation: Placentae on inner ovary wall within a non-sectioned ovary, corresponding to fused carpel margins. Two or more carpels, unilocular ovary. (e.g. &quot;Brassica&quot;)
*Superficial placentation: Similar to axile, but placentae are on inner surfaces of multilocular ovary (e.g. &quot;Nymphaea&quot;)

In gymnosperms such as conifers, ovules are borne on the surface of an ovuliferous (ovule-bearing) scale, usually within an ovulate cone (also called megastrobilus). In the early extinct seed ferns, ovules were borne on the surface of leaves. In the most recent of these taxa, a cupule (a modified branch or group of branches) surrounded the ovule (e.g. &quot;Caytonia&quot; or &quot;Glossopteris&quot;).

== Parts and development ==

Ovule orientation may be &quot;anatropous&quot;, such that when inverted the micropyle faces the placenta (this is the most common ovule orientation in flowering plants), &quot;amphitropous&quot;, &quot;campylotropous&quot;, or &quot;orthotropous&quot; (anatropous are common and micropyle is in downward position and chalazal end in on the upper position 
hence, in amphitropous the anatropous arrangement is tilted 90 degrees and in orthotropous it is completely inverted) .
The ovule appears to be a megasporangium with integuments surrounding it. Ovules are initially composed of diploid maternal tissue, which includes a megasporocyte (a cell that will undergo meiosis to produce megaspores). Megaspores remain inside the ovule and divide by mitosis to produce the haploid female gametophyte or megagametophyte, which also remains inside the ovule. The remnants of the megasporangium tissue (the nucellus) surround the megagametophyte. Megagametophytes produce archegonia (lost in some groups such as flowering plants), which produce egg cells. After fertilization, the ovule contains a diploid zygote and then, after cell division begins, an embryo of the next sporophyte generation. In flowering plants, a second sperm nucleus fuses with other nuclei in the megagametophyte forming a typically polyploid (often triploid) endosperm tissue, which serves as nourishment for the young sporophyte.

=== Integuments, micropyle, chalaza and hilum ===

An integument is a protective layer of cells surrounding the ovule. Gymnosperms typically have one integument (unitegmic) while angiosperms typically have two integuments (bitegmic). The evolutionary origin of the inner integument (which is integral to the formation of ovules from megasporangia) has been proposed to be by enclosure of a megasporangium by sterile branches (telomes). &quot;Elkinsia&quot;, a preovulate taxon, has a lobed structure fused to the lower third of the megasporangium, with the lobes extending upwards in a ring around the megasporangium. This might, through fusion between lobes and between the structure and the megasporangium, have produced an integument.

The origin of the second or outer integument has been an area of active contention for some time. The cupules of some extinct taxa have been suggested as the origin of the outer integument. A few angiosperms produce vascular tissue in the outer integument, the orientation of which suggests that the outer surface is morphologically abaxial. This suggests that cupules of the kind produced by the Caytoniales or Glossopteridales may have evolved into the outer integument of angiosperms.

The integuments develop into the seed coat when the ovule matures after fertilization.

The integuments do not enclose the nucellus completely but retain an opening at the apex referred to as the &quot;&quot;. The micropyle opening allows the pollen (a male gametophyte) to enter the ovule for fertilization. In gymnosperms (e.g., conifers), the pollen is drawn into the ovule on a drop of fluid that exudes out of the micropyle, the so-called pollination drop mechanism. Subsequently, the micropyle closes. In angiosperms, only a pollen tube enters the micropyle. During germination, the seedling&#x27;s radicle emerges through the micropyle.

Located opposite from the micropyle is the chalaza where the nucellus is joined to the integuments. Nutrients from the plant travel through the phloem of the vascular system to the funiculus and outer integument and from there apoplastically and symplastically through the chalaza to the nucellus inside the ovule. In chalazogamous plants, the pollen tubes enter the ovule through the chalaza instead of the micropyle opening.

=== Nucellus, megaspore and perisperm ===
The &quot;nucellus&quot; (plural: nucelli) is part of the inner structure of the ovule, forming a layer of diploid (sporophytic) cells immediately inside the integuments. It is structurally and functionally equivalent to the megasporangium. In immature ovules, the nucellus contains a megasporocyte (megaspore mother cell), which undergoes sporogenesis via meiosis. In the megasporocyte of &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, meiosis depends on the expression of genes that facilitate DNA repair and homologous recombination. 

In gymnosperms, three of the four haploid spores produced in meiosis typically degenerate, leaving one surviving megaspore inside the nucellus. Among angiosperms, however, a wide range of variation exists in what happens next. The number (and position) of surviving megaspores, the total number of cell divisions, whether nuclear fusions occur, and the final number, position and ploidy of the cells or nuclei all vary. A common pattern of embryo sac development (the &quot;Polygonum&quot; type maturation pattern) includes a single functional megaspore followed by three rounds of mitosis. In some cases, however, two megaspores survive (for example, in &quot;Allium&quot; and &quot;Endymion&quot;). In some cases all four megaspores survive, for example in the &quot;Fritillaria&quot; type of development (illustrated by &quot;Lilium&quot; in the figure) there is no separation of the megaspores following meiosis, then the nuclei fuse to form a triploid nucleus and a haploid nucleus. The subsequent arrangement of cells is similar to the &quot;Polygonum&quot; pattern, but the ploidy of the nuclei is different.

After fertilization, the nucellus may develop into the &quot;perisperm&quot; that feeds the embryo. In some plants, the diploid tissue of the nucellus can give rise to the embryo within the seed through a mechanism of asexual reproduction called nucellar embryony.

=== Megagametophyte ===
The haploid megaspore inside the nucellus gives rise to the female gametophyte, called the &quot;megagametophyte&quot;.

In gymnosperms, the megagametophyte consists of around 2000 nuclei and forms archegonia, which produce egg cells for fertilization.

In flowering plants, the megagametophyte (also referred to as the &quot;embryo sac&quot;) is much smaller and typically consists of only seven cells and eight nuclei. This type of megagametophyte develops from the megaspore through three rounds of mitotic divisions. The cell closest to the micropyle opening of the integuments differentiates into the egg cell, with two &quot;synergid cells&quot; by its side that are involved in the production of signals that guide the pollen tube. Three &quot;antipodal cells&quot; form on the opposite (chalazal) end of the ovule and later degenerate. The large &quot;central cell&quot; of the embryo sac contains two &quot;polar nuclei&quot;.

=== Zygote, embryo and endosperm ===
The pollen tube releases two sperm nuclei into the ovule. In gymnosperms, fertilization occurs within the archegonia produced by the female gametophyte. While it is possible that several egg cells are present and fertilized, typically only one zygote will develop into a mature embryo as the resources within the seed are limited. 

In flowering plants, one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg cell to produce a zygote, the other fuses with the two polar nuclei of the central cell to give rise to the polyploid (typically triploid) endosperm. This double fertilization is unique to flowering plants, although in some other groups the second sperm cell does fuse with another cell in the megagametophyte to produce a second embryo. The plant stores nutrients such as starch, proteins, and oils in the endosperm as a food source for the developing embryo and seedling, serving a similar function to the yolk of animal eggs. The endosperm is also called the albumen of the seed. the zygote then develops into a megasporophyte, which in turn produces one or more megasporangia. The ovule, with the developing megasporophyte, may be described as either tenuinucellate or crassinucellate. The former has either no cells or a single cell layer between the megasporophyte and the epidermal cells, while the latter has multiple cell layers between. 

Embryos may be described by a number of terms including &quot;Linear&quot; (embryos have axile placentation and are longer than broad), or &quot;rudimentary&quot; (embryos are basal in which the embryo is tiny in relation to the endosperm).

=== Types of gametophytes ===
Megagametophytes of flowering plants may be described according to the number of megaspores developing, as either &quot;monosporic&quot;, &quot;bisporic&quot;, or &quot;tetrasporic&quot;. (RF)

<text>The Dublin Gazette was the gazette, or official newspaper, of the Irish Executive, the British-controlled government in Ireland based at Dublin Castle, between 1705 and 1922. Like the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on which it was modelled, its strapline was &quot;Published by Authority&quot;, and it published notices of government business, including proclamations, the granting of royal assent to bills, writs of election, appointments to public office, commissions and promotions in the armed forces, and awards of honours, as well as notices of insolvency, grants of arms or change of name. The most important notices were generally printed in both the Dublin and London gazettes.

After the 1921–1922 partition of Ireland, &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; was superseded in Northern Ireland by &quot;The Belfast Gazette&quot; and in the Irish Free State by &quot;Iris Oifigiúil&quot;.

==History==

In 1670, when Elisha Leighton became Chief Secretary for Ireland, he began a gazette in Dublin, but stopped after a few months because there was &quot;so little news to &#x27;stuff it. 
Notices relating to Ireland were occasionally published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, for example the statutory preparation for the 1679 Irish Parliament.
In late 1688 James II fled London and was deposed as king; in 1689 he established a power base in Dublin, summoned an Irish Parliament in May and established a gazette. After James lost the Battle of the Boyne to William III, the office of King&#x27;s Printer was restored to Andrew II Crooke, whose &quot;Dublin Intelligence&quot; claimed to be &quot;published by authority&quot; from 1690 to 1693. This newspaper&#x27;s official status was marginal; Dublin Castle made little input and reprimanded it for publishing a &quot;scandalous&quot; notice from the Jacobite Sir Theobald Butler.

In 1705, under the Lord Lieutenancy of the 2nd Duke of Ormonde, a new &quot;Dublin Gazette&quot; was founded, although in its early days it was only two pages in length. The earliest surviving copy, dated 9 February 1706, is numbered as Issue 84 and is held in the Library of Trinity College Dublin (TCD). &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot;&#x27;s first printer was Edwin Sandys: a proclamation dated from Dublin Castle on 25 October 1705 notified the people of Ireland that &quot;to prevent imposition by the publication of any false news, the Lords Justices directed the paper entitled &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; to be published by their authority, and had appointed their secretary, Edwin Sandys, to peruse the same constantly, before it be printed; and that Edwin Sandys, at the Custom House Printing-office, should be the printer and publisher thereof.&quot;

The first act of the Parliament of Ireland referring to the &quot;Gazette&quot; was in 1727, requiring the publication in &quot;the &quot;Dublin-Gazette&quot; published by authority&quot; of the details of each new inmate in debtors&#x27; prison, for the benefit of creditors. That year three different periodicals were using the title &quot;Dublin Gazette&quot;: the authorised one printed and published by J. Gowan from 21 June; another by Christopher Dickson was titled the &quot;Dublin Gazette&quot; from 3 June until 4 July, when it was renamed &quot;Dickson&#x27;s News-Letter and Flying Post&quot;; while Thomas Hume&#x27;s &quot;Dublin Courant&quot; was in August 1726 renamed &quot;The Dublin Gazette: or, Weekly Courant&quot;, and continued until at least 1729.

The official status of the &quot;Gazette&quot;, through various changes of printer, is unclear prior to 21 August 1750, when the series of copies collected in the Chief Secretary&#x27;s Office begins with issue No. 1. Until some decades later, ownership of the title and any profits remained with the printer. Until the 1770s, &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; had less of the character of an organ of government than its London counterpart, since it included foreign news reports and private advertisements besides official notices. However, on 18 March 1776, an Order in Council was made which banned it from publishing news not &quot;guaranteed&quot; by the government. A notice subsequently appeared in the &quot;Gazette&quot; on 13 April 1776, dated from Dublin Castle on 27 March, stating &quot;that it is his majesty&#x27;s royal pleasure, that for the future, the &quot;Dublin Gazette&quot; shall, as nearly as possible, be put upon the same footing as the &quot;London Gazette&quot;; and that it shall contain no other articles of news than such as are authorized by his majesty&#x27;s government of this kingdom, or duly authenticated; and his excellency the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland has appointed Mr W. Roseingrave compiler of the said Dublin Gazette.&quot;

The office of Compiler of &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; was in fact a sinecure; William Roseingrave had been first appointed during pleasure under letters patent on 20 April 1763, at which time he was already under secretary to the Second Secretary. Roseingrave died in 1780 and was succeeded by William Williams Hewitt, son of James Hewitt, 1st Viscount Lifford; he died in 1798 and was succeeded by Nicholas Price, a relative of Viscount Castlereagh.

The printers of the &quot;Gazette&quot; held onto their ownership until almost the end of the 18th century. There was a sensation on 9 April 1799, when two rival versions were published, one by the established publisher, Sir St George O&#x27;Kelly, and a second by George II Grierson, the King&#x27;s Printer, who claimed authorisation from Price, the new Compiler. O&#x27;Kelly complained, to no avail, about the expropriation of his interest, thereafter losing the right to publish the title. Murphy surmises that, the year between the 1798 Rebellion and the Act of Union, the Irish government felt it needed total control. The Union abolished the Irish Parliament and hugely decreased the work for a King&#x27;s Printer, such that printing the &quot;Gazette&quot; provided most of Grierson&#x27;s business for several years. In the financial years 1819 to 1820, fees paid by the government to Grierson for printing notices in the &quot;Dublin Gazette&quot; amounted to £6,354, compared to a total of £15,021 for printing in various private newspapers.

As part of the 1817 absorption of the Exchequer of Ireland into the British Exchequer, the office of Compiler was among those scheduled to be abolished upon the demise of the present holder. In 1834, George III Grierson testified that he as printer paid fees of £1200 to Price as Compiler, that Price also received a salary of £300 from the Dublin Castle administration, and that Price did no work but was accountable for any errors. Price denied that his office was a sinecure, but in September 1836 he surrendered his patent in return for an annual pension of £1,590, which &quot;The Spectator&quot; reckoned eight times the value of the work he had been doing. In 1850, Alexander Thom took over as printer from Grierson&#x27;s sons. Changes in 1836 and 1850 meant the printer produced the &quot;Gazette&quot; on a contract basis rather than retaining the profits, and government notices were included without charge. In the 1880s annual profits for the government were £400–£500.

Legal changes during the Tithe War of the 1830s required Church of Ireland ministers to place notices relating to their tithes within the &quot;Gazette&quot;, causing them to complain at the expense, responsibility for which was uncertain. In 1865, the Irish Court for Criminal Cases Reserved said that an 1857 issue of &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; which stated it was &quot;printed by authority&quot; was not &quot;prima facie&quot; admissible evidence under a statute requiring it to state that it was &quot;printed by the Queen&#x27;s authority&quot;. By contrast, the High Court of Justice in Ireland ruled in 1902 that a similar statute was satisfied by a 1902 issue which stated at the start it was &quot;published by authority&quot; and at the end that it was &quot;printed under the authority of His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office&quot;.

In evidence to an official enquiry in 1856, the Secretary to the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland noted that a bequest for £3,000 had gone unclaimed for years despite being posted in the &quot;Gazette&quot;, and said, &quot;there ought to be some better medium than the &quot;Gazette&quot;, which, it has been said, is a place to keep a secret.&quot; When an 1891 Land Purchase Bill required certain notices be printed in the &quot;Dublin Gazette&quot;, Thomas Sexton secured an additional requirement to place the notice in a newspaper published in the same county as the land for purchase; he argued &quot;that &quot;Gazette&quot; only circulates among officials, mainly in the City of Dublin&quot;.

Until September 1887 the &quot;Gazette&quot; published average cereal prices from major towns. In 1898 the cessation was ruled in court to have the unintended consequence that quarter sessions and the Irish Land Commission lost their statutory power to alter agricultural rents based on the reported prices. In the debate on the 1900 bill that removed the anomaly, Independent Nationalist MP Tim Healy said, &quot;the editor of the &quot;Dublin Gazette&quot; ... is the one journalist who is always entitled to my sympathy, and I suppose he was so busy printing coercion proclamations that, in the language of Fleet Street, his columns were &quot;crowded out,&quot; and he had no room for printing the corn returns. ... I think also that if these corn returns in the &quot;Dublin Gazette&quot;, and even if the &quot;Gazette&quot; itself disappeared, Ireland as a whole would not be sorry.&quot;

At the beginning of the Easter Rising of 1916, the &quot;Gazette&quot; published a proclamation by Lord Wimborne, as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, of martial law. This stated that &quot;certain evilly disposed persons&quot; had &quot;with deadly weapons attacked the Forces of the Crown&quot;. &quot;The Gazette&quot; ceased publication during the Rising and for more than a week following it, with the result that a compendium issue was later published for the period between 25 April and 9 May 1916.

==Supersession==

From 1919, during the Irish War of Independence, the &quot;Gazette&quot; was challenged by the &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot;, the official newspaper of the rival government of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic, produced clandestinely by its Department of Propaganda and appearing weekly from 11 November 1919 to 11 July 1921.

The Government of Ireland Act 1920 led to the creation of Northern Ireland in May 1921 and &quot;The Belfast Gazette&quot;, which first appeared on 7 June 1921, printed notices from the Northern Ireland government and the local authorities in its jurisdiction. Various Orders in Council, made by the Lord Lieutenant in 1921 and 1922 and his successor the Governor of Northern Ireland in 1922 and 1923, provided that references in previous legislation to &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; would be construed in relation to Northern Ireland as to the &quot;Belfast Gazette&quot;.

The War of Independence resulted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty, signed in London on 6 December 1921, and a nationalist Provisional Government recognised by the British on 16 January 1922 took over administration within what had been Southern Ireland and would become the Irish Free State. The final issue of &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; (number 21,977) was printed by Thom&#x27;s and published on 27 January 1922. Four days later, now by authority of the Provisional Government, Thom&#x27;s printed issue No. 1 of &quot;Iris Oifigiúil&quot;, initially with &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; as a subtitle and an essentially unchanged layout, except that the masthead changed the name and removed the royal arms. The name &quot;&quot;Iris Oifigiúil&quot; (the Dublin Gazette)&quot; was also used in statutory orders made by Diarmaid Fawsitt under the authority of the Provisional Government.

In December 1922, the Constitution of the Irish Free State came into force, the Provisional Government became the Executive Council, and the Free State Oireachtas passed an Adaptation of Enactments Act, which provided that references in British legislation to &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; would be construed as &quot;Iris Oifigiúil&quot;.

==Archives==
A complete set of bound volumes of &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; 1750–1922 is now in the Oireachtas library. It was transferred to the Provisional Government from the Chief Secretary&#x27;s office when Dublin Castle was handed over in January 1922. 
Other large runs are in TCD Library, 
the National Library of Ireland, 
and the British Library. 
The Oireachtas volumes from 1750 to 1815 (except 1759, 1776, 1777) have been digitised, and individual issues can be freely searched and downloaded from both the library&#x27;s catalogue and JSTOR. 
Subscription-based online archives include the Burney Collection of Newspapers (1708–1712; 1724–1725; 1797) and NewspaperArchive (1706–1744; from a 1950 microfilm, metadata misdates some issues as 18xx or 19xx instead of 17xx).

The &quot;Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland&quot;, a website established for the centenary of the 1922 Four Courts explosion to recreate many of the Irish public records then destroyed, intends to make freely available a complete set of &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot;, combined from partial sets in various libraries.

<doc id="535949" wikidata="Q4043344" url="?curid=535949" title="M1 Tank Platoon">
<text>M1 Tank Platoon is a tactical simulator of tank warfare developed and published by MicroProse for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS in 1989. The game features a mixture of first-person, third-person tank warfare, and tactical simulation gameplay. It was followed by a sequel, &quot;M1 Tank Platoon II&quot;, released by MicroProse in 1998 for Windows. &quot;M1 Tank Platoon&quot; was sold to Interplay Entertainment in 2009. M1 Tank Platoon is available on Steam and Epic Games services. 

==Gameplay==
The player is put in the position of a main battle tank platoon commander in charge of four U.S. M1 Abrams tanks in a fictional campaign of battles against the Soviet Army in Central Europe. The player can give orders to friendly units via a tactical map of the battle area as well as taking control of a single tank - assuming the role of either the tank commander, driver or gunner. Between the battles, surviving crew members increase in military rank and skill—giving the player an incentive to keep their team alive.

Depending on the player&#x27;s tastes, the whole game can be played more like an action/simulation game or like a strategy game. As platoon commander, direct control is limited to the four M1 tanks, however depending on the mission, support units like recon and attack helicopters, M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, MLRS artillery systems or other older M60 Patton tanks are available and can be given orders via the tactical map.

One feature of the game is the ability to change the viewpoint to a supporting unit to get a &quot;recon&quot; from that unit&#x27;s perspective. According to the manual, doing this from the M1 tanks was supposedly approximate to a tank commander standing on his tank hull to get a better perspective. The external view is also able to track other objects in the centre of the view; this is not limited to vehicles but can actually track missiles or even tank rounds.

The Campaign typically depicts the rush across the Rhine by the numerically superior enemy forces. The Campaign starts as defensive with the challenge being to use technologically superior NATO vehicles to stem the &quot;wave&quot; of Warsaw Pact vehicles. Success may result on the scenarios gradually putting NATO on the offensive side with objective waypoints to reach/hold.

Terrain is a very important factor as going hull down was a critical strategy to surviving. Full use of the supporting forces makes success easier with even the infantry disembarking from their IFVs to use M47 Dragon anti-tank launchers. However, leaving them in one position too long invited an artillery barrage from the opposing force.

==Reception==
A United States Army Reserves officer and graduate of Armor School, Evan Brooks, stated in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; that &quot;M1 Tank Platoon&quot; was the first computer tank game to give the player control over four tanks instead of one. He favorably reviewed the game&#x27;s documentation, internal and external graphics, and depiction of interdependent combat arms, and concluded that it was &quot;the best armor simulator currently available&quot;. A General Dynamics Land Systems Simulation Lab software engineer, Dana Cadman, compared M1 Tank Platoon to other tank games of the time and the Army&#x27;s SimNet training network in a later Computer Gaming World article. 1992 and 1994 surveys by the same author of wargames with modern settings gave the game four stars out of five. The game got 5 out of 5 stars in &quot;Dragon&quot;.

In 1990 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named it as Simulation Game of the Year, and in 1996, the magazine ranked it as the 32nd best PC game of all time. In 1991, &quot;PC Format&quot; placed &quot;M1 Tank Platoon&quot; on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time. The editors wrote, &quot;This is both a tank simulator and an excellent land combat game. Great graphics, gorgeous heavy weaponry, lots of strategy involved — can&#x27;t go wrong really.&quot;

The game sold 400,000 copies worldwide.

<text>Julia B. Cameron (born March 4, 1948) is an American teacher, author, artist, poet, playwright, novelist, filmmaker, composer, and journalist. She is best known for her book &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Way&quot; (1992). She also has written many other non-fiction works, short stories, and essays, as well as novels, plays, musicals, and screenplays.

==Biography==
Julia Cameron was born in Libertyville, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, and raised Catholic. She was the second oldest of seven children. She started college at Georgetown University before transferring to Fordham University. She wrote for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and then &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

She met Martin Scorsese while on assignment for &quot;Oui Magazine&quot;. They married in 1976 and divorced a year later in 1977. They have one daughter, Domenica Cameron-Scorsese, born in 1976. The marriage ended after Scorsese began seeing Liza Minnelli while the three of them were working on &quot;New York, New York&quot;. Cameron and Scorsese collaborated on three films. Her memoir &quot;Floor Sample&quot; details her descent into alcoholism and drug addiction, which induced blackouts, paranoia and psychosis. In 1978, reaching a point in her life when writing and drinking could no longer coexist, Cameron stopped abusing drugs and alcohol, and began teaching creative unblocking, eventually publishing the book based on her work: &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Way&quot;. At first she sold Xeroxed copies of the book in a local bookstore before it was published by TarcherPerigee in 1992. She contends that creativity is an authentic spiritual path.

Cameron has taught filmmaking, creative unblocking, and writing. She has taught at The Smithsonian, Esalen, the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies, and the New York Open Center. At Northwestern University, she was writer in residence for film. In 2008 she taught a class at the New York Open Center, &quot;The Right to Write,&quot; named and modeled after one of her bestselling books, which reveals the importance of writing. 

Cameron has lived in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City, and Washington, D.C. She lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

<doc id="535960" wikidata="Q7163519" url="?curid=535960" title="Pennsic War">
<text>The Pennsic War is an annual American medieval and Renaissance camping event held by the Society for Creative Anachronism (SCA), a &quot;war&quot; between two large regional SCA groups: the Kingdom of the East and the Middle Kingdom. It is the single largest annual SCA event, with more than 10,000 people attending each year, from as far as China, South Korea, Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, and Australia.

Pennsic is held in late summer and lasts for 17 days (begins on a Friday, ends on the third Sunday). The event centers on pre-17th century history and culture with all campers dressing in historically relevant clothing. The winners of the battles and other activities receive war points, and the Kingdom with the most war points wins that Pennsic. 
The Pennsic War uses numbers to identify each war rather than the year it was held, so the 2019 event was known as &quot;Pennsic War 48&quot;, there having been 47 previous events. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no Pennsic event was held in 2020 or 2021, and so the 2022 event is known as &quot;Pennsic War 49&quot;.

== History ==
The Pennsic War takes place in late July/early August. Prior to 2007, Pennsic took place during the first two weeks of August, and some of the earliest Pennsics were held during September.

* The first Pennsic was held in 1972, at Newton&#x27;s Campground (now Shorehaven Campground) in Waterford, Pennsylvania.
* The second was held at St. Clair Beach Campground near Pittsburgh.
* The third was held on a private farm in Wexford, Pennsylvania.
* The fourth, often called &quot;Pennsic Pour&quot; or &quot;Pennsic Puddle&quot;, was held at Spencer Farm on Aquilla Road near Chardon, Ohio and was marred by massive flooding and mudslides. This is celebrated in song by performer Duke Moonwulf Starkadderson in &quot;Pennsic War IV&quot;.
* The fifth was held at the Berlin Reservoir outside Alliance, Ohio, after a site in West Virginia was rejected.
* The sixth and all subsequent Pennsics have been held at Coopers Lake Campground in Worth Township near Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania near the intersection of Interstate 79 and US 422. The site is easily visible from the I-79 southbound lanes.

According to the HERSTAĐR-SAGA: An Incomplete History of Pennsic,

One day, almost 30 years ago, Cariadoc of the Bow, the King of the Middle, got bored with peace and declared war upon the East, loser to take Pittsburgh. The King of the East read the declaration of war, filed it away and forgot about it. Time passed. Cariadoc moved to New York and subsequently became King of the East, whereupon he retrieved the declaration from the file cabinet and said, &quot;Let&#x27;s fight.&quot; The Middle won, and Cariadoc has the distinction of being the only king who declared war upon himself and lost.

Nearly every person who attends Pennsic has heard this story, and nearly every element of this story is incorrect. Negotiations for an inter-kingdom war had begun in early 1971 under the reigns of Murad (East) and Franz (Middle). The Middle did not prepare its declaration of war until January 1972, by which time Cariadoc had stepped down and Irial had succeeded the throne of the Middle. Cariadoc carried the challenge to the East in the form of a war arrow, which he presented that spring to the Eastern king, Shogun Rakkurai, who broke the arrow and cast it to the floor, saying &quot;that&#x27;s what we will do with your armies.&quot; It took months to arrange the details, so the date and location of the first Pennsic War were not announced until August 1972, by which time Rakkurai had stepped down and Cariadoc had succeeded the throne of the East. The territory of Pittsburgh was never in dispute and never changed hands, remaining part of the East until the formation of Æthelmearc in 1997.

== People ==
Since Pennsic XXV in 1996, the event has gathered over 10,000 participants most years. These include not only SCA members from across the globe, but also members of various other historical re-enactment groups such as Markland; and martial arts–based organizations, such as the Tuchux or Rome. Pennsic is, however, an SCA event; members of other groups are welcome, but are generally expected to follow SCA rules—especially in regards to armor, weapons and behavior on the battlefield for the various fighting scenarios. According to the official Pennsic website, the final count for 2015 was 10,556.
In 2023, the 50th Pennsic War, the final count was 11,384 
== Activities ==

===Martial===
* Archery
* SCA heavy combat
* SCA fencing
* Thrown weapons
* Youth combat

=== Non-martial ===
* Pennsic University (and its offshoot, Bog U): a framework of classes where attendees learn period skills, trades, and performing arts.
* Arts and sciences exhibition.
* Youth arts and sciences exhibition.
* Performing arts: which include acrobatics, busking, comedy, dance, magic, music, juggling, and theatre.
* Period games: where one can play board games such as Go, chess and tafl games, card games such as tarot card games and dice games.
* Pennsic Choir.
* Dancing: including Renaissance dances, Middle Eastern dance, South Asian dance, and East Asian dance.
* Shopping (roughly 250 vendors)

== Local impact ==
With over 10,000 people, Pennsic becomes the fourth largest populated place in Butler County, PA (after Cranberry and Butler townships, and the City of Butler). Pennsic&#x27;s annual economic impact on the immediate area amounts to $1.8 million added into the Butler County economy, and many local businesses cite the period during Pennsic being among their busiest of the year. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic when no Pennsic was held, regular Pennsic attendees who were aware of the event&#x27;s historically positive impact on businesses organized fundraising for charities local to the area.

<text>Paulie is a 1998 American adventure comedy-drama film directed by John Roberts and written by Laurie Craig. The film follows the adventurous story of the eponymous Paulie, a talking parrot who is capable of communicating with humans. It stars Jay Mohr as the voice of the title character, alongside Gena Rowlands, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin, and Bruce Davison.

It received mixed-to-positive reviews and was a box office disappointment, grossing $26.9 million domestically against a $23 million budget. However, in the years after its release, &quot;Paulie&quot; would find a larger audience on home media sales. The film marked Buddy Hackett&#x27;s last feature film appearance before his death in 2003.

==Plot==
While working as a janitor at an American institute, Russian immigrant Misha Vilyenkov encounters Paulie, a wisecracking and loudmouthed blue-crowned conure who can speak as clearly as a human. Subsequently, he doesn&#x27;t speak a word when Misha brings Dr. Reingold, the head of the institute, and other scientists to witness him.

Frustrated with Paulie at first, Misha relents and opens up about his homesickness. Paulie warms up to Misha, and he tells him his story about his original owner, a little girl named Marie Alweather who stutters. The story transitions to a flashback when he was gifted to her in his infancy. As Marie works on speech therapy, he begins to speak. Her father, Warren, a soldier, returns home from Vietnam and decides that Paulie is not helping her, believing their bond is disillusioning Marie&#x27;s reality due to her claims of his ability to talk; Paulie never spoke to her parents out of fear towards them, and also refused to learn how to fly due to acrophobia. After a near-death experience in which she falls off the roof in an attempt to teach Paulie to fly, Warren sends him away, devastating Marie.

Paulie is passed down to various owners and eventually ends up in a pawn shop where he spends his time badmouthing the customers. One day, a shady customer named Benny shows interest in purchasing him, thinking he could profit from his speaking abilities, until widowed artist Ivy purchases him first with the intent of reforming his ill behavior after he insults her. She befriends Paulie and agrees to help him find Marie, who has moved to Los Angeles. They begin traveling using her mobile home, but when she becomes blind in the middle of their trip, Paulie decides to stay and take care of her. She eventually passes away, and Paulie, having finally learned to fly, continues his journey.

In East Los Angeles, Paulie joins a group of performing conures owned by migrant musician Ignacio, temporarily forgetting about Marie as he develops feelings for a female named Lupe. At one of his performances, Benny, having also moved to Los Angeles, recognizes him and attempts to purchase him from Ignacio. When Ignacio refuses, Benny makes a prank call to the police at one of his performances. As the police show up, Benny kidnaps Paulie amidst the chaos as Ignacio is arrested and presumably deported. Under Benny&#x27;s influence, Paulie begins a life of crime. In a botched jewel theft, he flies down through the chimney of a house, where he gets caught by the grandson of its owner. Benny flees the scene, betraying and abandoning Paulie in the process.

Paulie is then brought to the institute, where Reingold, his employees and fellow scientists are stunned by his ability to speak to humans. They subject him to speech testing, and Reingold promises that he will be reunited with Marie once finished. Paulie overhears Reingold privately revealing that he and the institute have found Marie’s whereabouts, but concealed this information from him so that he would remain their property. Realizing he&#x27;s been lied to all this time, a resentful Paulie humiliates Reingold in front of his scientific peers by acting like an ordinary parrot, disrespecting him and his assistants while refusing to cooperate with more tests. He then calls out Reingold&#x27;s deception, and tries to make a break for it. As a result, his wings are clipped and he is eventually imprisoned in the basement when he starts pecking the researchers.

Moved by Paulie&#x27;s story, Misha decides to release him and take him to Marie. They find Marie&#x27;s contact information in Reingold&#x27;s office, only to be caught by him. Misha stands up to Reingold for his cruelty to Paulie and gladly resigns. They narrowly escape the institute, just after releasing the other caged animals in the testing lab. The duo reach Marie&#x27;s address, and find her as a beautiful young woman unrecognizable to Paulie. After singing a song her mother sang to her as a child, Paulie realizes that she is Marie and they happily reunite. He also realizes he can fly again as his feathers have regrown. Misha prepares to depart, but Paulie and Marie offer him to stay. Misha, evidently infatuated with Marie, decides to accept. The film ends with the trio happily entering her house.

==Production==

Directed by John Roberts and written by Laurie Craig, the film&#x27;s production budget was $23 million.

Craig mentioned in an interview, &quot;Paulie was an original story of mine.  I was inspired by seeing a lone parrot in a cage and I wondered what it would be like if he could actually tell me his life story.  Then I read about the amazing African Grey parrot named Alex who had a large vocabulary and was very bonded with his researcher.&quot;

During the production of the film, 14 trained blue-crowned conures were used to portray the titular character, with other conure species such as nanday, jenday and cherry-headed conures appearing in supporting roles.

Exterior shots of young Marie&#x27;s house were filmed in Azusa, CA, on the corner of N. Soldano Ave. and Sixth St. Unfortunately, the house was demolished a couple of years after production, and the lot was split up for smaller homes. The production team mailed thank you letters to the residents along the street for the inconvenience.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Box office receipts grossed $5,369,800 on the opening weekend, and $26,875,268 total. It was released in 1,812 North American theaters.

===Critical response===
The film scored a 62% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes from 37 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. It was distributed in 24 countries and 10 different languages between 1998 and 1999.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Times&quot; gave the film two stars out of four and said, &quot;Dogs and cats, horses and monkeys and even bears make charismatic movie stars, but &quot;Paulie&quot;, I think, suggests that birds are more decorative than dramatic.&quot; Tracey Moore of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; gave the film a four stars out of five and said, &quot;Talking bird on a coming-of-age journey with some peril.&quot;

<doc id="535970" wikidata="Q709513" url="?curid=535970" title="Arthur Goldberg">
<text>Arthur Joseph Goldberg (August 8, 1908January 19, 1990) was an American statesman and jurist who served as the 9th U.S. Secretary of Labor, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and the 6th United States Ambassador to the United Nations.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Goldberg graduated from the Northwestern University School of Law in 1930. He became a prominent labor attorney and helped arrange the merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. During World War II, he served in the Office of Strategic Services, organizing European resistance to Nazi Germany. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Goldberg as the Secretary of Labor. During Vietnam, he served in the Air Force Reserve.

In 1962, Kennedy successfully nominated Goldberg to the Supreme Court to fill a vacancy created by the retirement of Felix Frankfurter. Goldberg aligned with the liberal bloc of justices and wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Escobedo v. Illinois&quot;. In 1965, Goldberg resigned from the bench to accept appointment by President Lyndon B. Johnson as the Ambassador to the United Nations. In that role, he helped draft UN Resolution 242 in the aftermath of the Six-Day War. He ran for governor of New York in 1970 but was defeated by Nelson Rockefeller. After his defeat, he served as president of the American Jewish Committee and continued to practice law.

==Early life and education==
Goldberg was born and raised on West Side, Chicago, the youngest of eight children of Rebecca Perlstein and Joseph Goldberg, Orthodox Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire. His paternal line derived from a shtetl called Zenkhov, in Ukraine, while his mother&#x27;s family was from Tetiev. Goldberg&#x27;s father, a produce peddler, died in 1916, forcing Goldberg&#x27;s siblings to quit school and go to work to support the family. As the youngest child, Goldberg was allowed to continue school, but worked jobs on the side, including as a vendor at Wrigley Field and as a library clerk, to help support his family. He was childhood friends with future professional boxer Jackie Fields. Goldberg attended classes and lectures at the Hull House, which aimed to educate recent European immigrants. He graduated from Harrison Technical High School at the age of 16.

Goldberg&#x27;s interest in the law was sparked by the noted murder trial in 1924 of Leopold and Loeb, two wealthy young Chicagoans who were spared the death penalty with the help of their high-powered defense attorney, Clarence Darrow. Goldberg attended the trial while he was a high school senior. Goldberg later pointed to the case as inspiration for his opposition to the death penalty on the bench, since he had seen how inequality of social status could lead to unfair application of the death penalty. Jewish Supreme Court Justices Louis Brandeis and Benjamin Cardozo also served as inspiration to Goldberg from a young age.

Goldberg, who worked part time as a construction worker, took night courses at Crane Junior College of the City Colleges of Chicago and DePaul University. He later earned a B.S.L. (&quot;magna cum laude&quot;; 1929) and J.D. (1930) degrees from Northwestern University. Goldberg served as the Editor of the &quot;Illinois Law Review&quot; (now known as the Northwestern Law Review) and helped Law Dean John Henry Wigmore write his third edition of the treatise on evidence. Goldberg graduated from Northwestern law school in just 2.5 years and with the highest academic record ever at Northwestern. Being just 21-years-old, he was too young to pass the Illinois Bar. However, he sued and successfully argued his own case to be admitted to the bar.

In 1931, Goldberg married Dorothy Kurgans. They had one daughter, Barbara Goldberg Cramer, and one son, Robert M. Goldberg (an attorney in Anchorage, Alaska). He was the uncle of prolific blues rock keyboardist Barry Goldberg.

==Military Services==
During World War II, Goldberg joined the United States Army in 1942, wherein he served as a captain and later a major, and he served until the war ended in 1945. He wanted to join the Marines, but was not physically fit enough. Goldberg served as well in an espionage group operated by the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA, serving as chief of the Labor Desk, an autonomous division of the American intelligence agency that was charged with the task of cultivating contacts and networks within the European underground labor movement during World War II. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency stated, &quot;Goldberg&#x27;s file notes that as both a civilian and a member of the Army, he supervised a section in the Secret Intelligence Branch of OSS to maintain contact with labor groups and organizations regarded as potential resistance elements in enemy-occupied and enemy countries. He organized anti-Nazi European transportation workers into an extensive intelligence network.&quot;

During the Vietnam War, Goldberg commissioned as a colonel in the Air Force Reserve but resigned in 1964 to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest after his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.

==Early legal career==
Due to antisemitism, Goldberg was unable to work in Chicago&#x27;s big law firms because they would not hire Jews. Instead, he started his legal career at Pritzger &amp; Pritzger, a firm founded by German Jews. However, he was uncomfortable with his work at Pritzger because the work mainly dealt with representing large businesses.

Goldberg&#x27;s interest in labor law spiked at the start of The Great Depression and in 1933 he left Pritzger to create his own boutique law firm, which was focused on labor law. Goldberg joined the National Lawyers Guild (NLG), a group that was advocating for The New Deal, in the mid-1930s. However, Goldberg, among others, resigned a few years later due to the NLG&#x27;s growing association with the American Communist Party.

Goldberg became a prominent labor lawyer and represented striking Chicago newspaper workers on behalf of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1938. The strike went on for eight months and Goldberg spent almost everyday in court arguing on the worker&#x27;s behalf. Eventually, the strike persuaded William Randolph Hearst to recognize the newspaper union. Appointed general counsel to the CIO in 1948 to succeed Lee Pressman, Goldberg served as a negotiator and chief legal adviser in the merger of the American Federation of Labor and CIO in 1955. AFL-CIO is one of the US major labor unions representing America&#x27;s workers and labor. Goldberg also served as general counsel of the United Steelworkers of America.

==Political career==

Goldberg was an active participant in the National Citizens Political Action Committee and the CIO Political Action Committee. He supported the presidential campaigns of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Goldberg initially supported Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s efforts to investigate communism in the United States, but soon opposed those efforts after it became clear they threatened the organized labor movement.

In 1960, Goldberg wanted his friend Adlai Stevenson to run for president, but Stevenson encouraged Goldberg to back Hubert Humphrey. Instead, Goldberg backed Senator John F. Kennedy. Goldberg served as a labor advisor to Kennedy&#x27;s campaign and was influential in getting unions to back Kennedy.

===Kennedy administration===
President John F. Kennedy nominated Goldberg to be United States Secretary of Labor, where he served from 1961 to 1962. He was the third Jew to be named to a Cabinet position. Goldberg wanted to be named Attorney General, so he would improve his chances of getting nominated to the Supreme Court, but that spot went to Kennedy&#x27;s brother Robert. As Labor Secretary, Goldberg encouraged Kennedy to increase the minimum wage, extend unemployment benefits, create job opportunities for the youth and invest in economically distressed areas. Following Goldberg&#x27;s advice, Kennedy established the President&#x27;s Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity (PCEEO), which ensured employees are treated fairly regardless of &quot;race, creed, color, or national origin.&quot; Goldberg also championed the creation of the President&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy.

==Supreme Court==
On August 31, 1962, Kennedy nominated Goldberg as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to succeed Felix Frankfurter, who was retiring. Earlier that same year, Kennedy had considered nominating Goldberg to succeed Charles Whittaker, but chose Byron White instead. Frankfurter and Chief Justice Earl Warren were consulted by the President beforehand and both gave their full support.

He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on September 25, and served on the Court from October 1, 1962, until July 25, 1965. Only one Senator, Strom Thurmond from South Carolina, opposed his nomination. During his tenure, the seat Goldberg occupied on the Court came to be informally known as the &quot;Jewish seat&quot;, as his two immediate predecessors—Frankfurter and, before him, Benjamin Cardozo—were also Jewish. In more recent times, more than one justice of Jewish descent have served on the Court simultaneously. For example, the Supreme Court careers of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Elena Kagan overlapped.

, Goldberg is the last Cabinet official to have also served on the Supreme Court.

Despite his short time on the bench, Goldberg played a significant role in the Court&#x27;s jurisprudence. Replacing Justice Felix Frankfurter, who was a center-right Justice, Goldberg&#x27;s liberal views on constitutional questions shifted the Court&#x27;s balance toward a broader construction of constitutional rights. A self-described judicial activist, Goldberg voted for a liberal outcome in 89 percent of cases before the Court.

His best-known opinion came in his concurrence of &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965), arguing that the Ninth Amendment supported the existence of an unenumerated right of privacy. He argued that to determine if a right is a fundamental right, the court should look to whether the right involved is of such a character that it cannot be denied without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all America&#x27;s civil and political institutions.

Perhaps Goldberg&#x27;s most influential move on the Court involved the death penalty. Goldberg argued in a 1963 internal Supreme Court memorandum that imposition of the death penalty was condemned by the international community and should be regarded as &quot;cruel and unusual punishment,&quot; in contravention of the Eighth Amendment. Finding support in this position from two other justices (William J. Brennan and William O. Douglas), Goldberg published an opinion dissenting from the Court&#x27;s denial of certiorari in a case, &quot;Rudolph v. Alabama&quot;, involving the imposition of the death penalty for rape, in which Goldberg cited the fact that only five nations responding to a UN survey indicated that they allowed imposition of the death penalty for rape, including the U.S., and that 33 states in the U.S. had outlawed the practice.

Goldberg&#x27;s dissent sent a signal to lawyers across the nation to challenge the constitutionality of capital punishment in appeals. As a result of the influx of appeals, the death penalty effectively ceased to exist in the United States for the remainder of the 1960s and 1970s, and the Supreme Court considered the issue in the 1972 case of &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, where the Justices, in a 5 to 4 decision, effectively suspended the death penalty laws of states across the country on the ground of the capricious imposition of the penalty. That decision would be revisited in &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; (1976), where the justices voted to allow the death penalty under some circumstances; the death penalty for rape of an adult female victim, however, would be struck down in &quot;Coker v. Georgia&quot; (1977). In 2008, the death penalty for rape of children was ruled unconstitutional by a 5 to 4 decision (&quot;Kennedy v. Louisiana&quot;). Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Adam Liptak said that Goldberg&#x27;s dissent helped &quot;create the modern movement for the abolition of the death penalty.&quot;

Goldberg also wrote the majority opinions in &quot;Escobedo v. Illinois&quot;, which provided criminal defendants the right to counsel during interrogation under the Sixth Amendment and &quot;Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez&quot;, which declared unconstitutional parts of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 that revoked citizenship for those that had fled the country in order to dodge the draft.

Despite Goldberg&#x27;s short tenure on the court, a number of his law clerks have gone on to become deeply influential. Stephen Breyer later became an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and he held Goldberg&#x27;s seat on the Court from 1994 until 2022. Another of Goldberg&#x27;s law clerks was Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. Since other justices would be unlikely to hire a Jewish clerk, Goldberg emphasized hiring Jewish clerks. Six out of eight of his law clerks were Jewish.

==UN ambassador==
In 1965, Goldberg was persuaded by Johnson to resign his seat on the court to replace the recently deceased Adlai Stevenson II as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations (UN). Johnson wanted to appoint his friend, Abe Fortas, to the court. If any of his Great Society reforms were going to be deemed unconstitutional by the Court, he thought that Fortas would notify him in advance. Goldberg, who had declined an earlier offer to leave his position to be Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, took Johnson&#x27;s offer of the UN ambassadorship when Johnson discussed it with him on Air Force One to Illinois for Stevenson&#x27;s funeral. Goldberg was promised by Johnson that he would be a member of the President&#x27;s cabinet and would be involved in all decisions involving ending the Vietnam War. Bruce Allen Murphy, a professor at Lafayette College, wrote in one of his books that Johnson also told Goldberg that he would consider putting him on his ticket as vice president in the 1968 United States presidential election.

Goldberg wrote that he resigned to have influence in keeping the peace in Vietnam and that after the crisis had passed, he expected he would be reappointed to the Supreme Court by Johnson to replace the retiring Chief Justice Earl Warren. He also said, &quot;I had an exaggerated opinion of my capacities. I thought I could persuade Johnson that we were fighting the wrong war in the wrong place [and] to get out.&quot;

David Stebenne, Goldberg&#x27;s biographer, adds, &quot;Many observers, then and later, found this answer hard to accept.&quot; He suggests, &quot;Johnson must have had some influence over Goldberg that induced him [to resign from the Supreme Court].&quot; &quot;Time&quot; reported in 1962 that Johnson knew that for a party thrown in Johnson&#x27;s honor that year, a Goldberg aide, Jerry Holleman, solicited contributions from wealthy supporters of Johnson, including Billy Sol Estes. Holleman accepted responsibility and there was no public awareness of Goldberg and Johnson&#x27;s involvement.

Johnson said of the Goldberg decision in his later-released audio tapes:

Goldberg chose to retain only one of Stevenson&#x27;s aides, US Ambassador Charles W. Yost, a career Foreign Service Office who was able to help Goldberg navigate the intricacies of United Nations procedures, and foreign affairs debates in the Security Council. While serving as UN Ambassador, Goldberg was successful at brokering peace between Greece and Turkey during the Cyprus crisis of 1967 and helped diplomatically resolve a conflict between North Korea and the United States following the 1968 Pueblo incident.

===Resolution 242===

In 1967, Goldberg was a key drafter of Resolution 242, which followed the 1967 Six-Day War between Israel and the Arab states. While interpretation of that resolution has subsequently become controversial, Goldberg was very clear that the resolution does not obligate Israel to withdraw from all of the captured territories. He stated that:

Goldberg&#x27;s role as the UN ambassador during the Six-Day War may have been the reason why Sirhan Sirhan, the assassin of Robert F. Kennedy, also wanted to assassinate Goldberg.

==Subsequent career==

Frustrated with the war in Vietnam, Goldberg resigned from the ambassadorship in 1968 and accepted a senior partnership with the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison. Longing to return to the bench, Goldberg later claimed that he was Earl Warren&#x27;s preference to succeed him when the chief justice announced his retirement in 1968, but President Johnson selected Abe Fortas instead. After Fortas&#x27;s nomination was withdrawn in the face of Senate opposition, Johnson briefly considered naming Goldberg chief justice as a recess appointment before ruling out the idea. On 15 October 1969, Goldberg was a featured speaker at the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam march.

With the prospect of a return to the Supreme Court closed to him by the election of Richard Nixon, Goldberg contemplated a run for elected office. Initially considering a challenge to Charles Goodell&#x27;s reelection to the United States Senate, he decided to run against New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1970. Though the former justice initially polled well, his campaign was unsuccessful. Goldberg faced accusations of being a &quot;carpetbagger&quot; by the New York media and he faced a contested Democratic primary campaign against Howard J. Samuels. Although Goldberg won the Democratic primary, his poor skills as a campaigner and lack of knowledge about New York (while campaigning in Manhattan, he mistakenly claimed that he was in Brooklyn), coupled with Rockefeller&#x27;s formidable advantages, resulted in a 700,000 vote margin of victory for the incumbent Republican. At one point in the campaign, Goldberg told a voter, who commented that he wished he was still on the Court &quot;so do I, sometimes.&quot; Basil Paterson was his running mate as Lt. Governor. Paterson&#x27;s son, David, later became Governor in 2008.

After his defeat, Goldberg returned to law practice in Washington, D.C., and served as President of the American Jewish Committee. In 1972, Goldberg returned to the Supreme Court as a lawyer, representing Curt Flood in &quot;Flood v. Kuhn&quot;. His oral argument was referred to by one observer as &quot;one of the worst arguments I&#x27;d ever heard – by one of the smartest men I&#x27;ve ever known...&quot; Under President Jimmy Carter, Goldberg served as United States Ambassador to the Belgrade Conference on Human Rights in 1977, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1978.

Goldberg was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations from 1966 until 1989.

Goldberg died in 1990. As a former member of the U.S. Army he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

<text>Bloodsport is a 1988 American martial arts film directed by Newt Arnold. The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme, with a supporting cast of Leah Ayres, Forest Whitaker, Donald Gibb, Roy Chiao, and Bolo Yeung. The film centers on Frank Dux (Van Damme), a United States Army Captain and ninjutsu practitioner who competes in an underground full-contact martial arts tournament called the Kumite in Hong Kong. Based on Dux&#x27;s real-life claims, the film was marketed as a true story. It was one of Van Damme&#x27;s first lead roles and showcased his abilities, launching his career as a mainstream action star.

The screenplay is based on many of Dux&#x27;s claims first covered in the November 1980 issue of &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine. The real Dux served as the action choreographer and technical advisor. After its release, many of Dux&#x27;s claims were disputed, including by co-screenwriter Sheldon Lettich, who claimed Dux fabricated his fight record and the existence of the Kumite.

&quot;Bloodsport&quot; was produced and released by Cannon Films on February 26, 1988. Despite negative critical reviews, it was a considerable box office success, grossing $50 million on a budget of $1.5–2.3 million. The success of the film helped the resurgence of the martial arts film genre in America. It has also been identified as a cult film and spawned a film series which includes four sequels.

== Plot ==
U.S. Army Captain Frank Dux has trained in the ways of ninjutsu under his sensei Senzo Tanaka. As a boy, Dux and some of his friends broke into Tanaka&#x27;s home to steal a katana, but Dux was apprehended while returning the katana to its place. Impressed by Dux&#x27;s integrity and toughness, Senzo decided to train him alongside his son, Shingo. After Shingo&#x27;s death, Senzo trains Dux as a member of the Tanaka clan. Dux is invited to the Kumite, an illegal martial arts tournament in Hong Kong. After his Army superiors refuse to let him go, Dux goes absent without leave, says goodbye to his sensei and leaves for Hong Kong. Two Criminal Investigation Command agents, Helmer and Rawlins, are assigned to track down and arrest Dux.

After arriving in Hong Kong, Dux befriends American Vale Tudo fighter Ray Jackson and their guide Victor Lin. When they arrive at the Kumite arena, the officials are skeptical but eventually accept them after Dux proves his connection to the Tanaka clan by performing the Dim Mak death touch. On the first day of the tournament, Dux earns the enmity of the ruthless Kumite champion Chong Li after breaking his record for the fastest knockout.

Dux becomes involved with American journalist Janice Kent, who is investigating the Kumite. Dux refuses to help her, but she sneaks into the arena by agreeing to a date with a spectator. On the second day, Jackson is matched against Chong Li. Although Jackson comes close to defeating Li, he wastes time showboating for the crowd, allowing Li to recover and brutally beat him. Dux visits Jackson in the hospital and vows to avenge him. After witnessing the brutality of the tournament, Kent argues with Dux and tries to convince him not to return. Dux tells her that he has to win in order to become the best he can be.

Helmer and Rawlins arrive in Hong Kong and contact local police inspector Chen. They begin asking around for Dux and track him down to his hotel. A chase through the downtown ensues but Dux evades them when they fall into a canal. When Dux arrives at the Kumite, Helmer and Rawlins are waiting for him, along with Chen and four of his officers. Dux defeats them, but agrees to return with Helmer and Rawlins after the tournament.

On the final day, Li kills his semifinal opponent, much to the consternation of the crowd. Fearing defeat in the final against Dux, Li conceals a salt pill in his waistband before the bout. When Dux gains the upper hand, Li blinds him by crushing the pill and throwing it into Dux&#x27;s face. Initially frustrated by his inability to see, Dux clears his mind and recalls his training from Tanaka, who taught him to fight blindfolded, overcoming the handicap and defeating Li by making him utter the phrase &quot;matté&quot;. The next day, he bids farewell to Kent and Jackson before returning to the United States with Helmer and Rawlins.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

=== Writing ===
Co-writer Sheldon Lettich came up with the idea for the film. According to Lettich:

I had known Frank Dux for a number of months before I came up with the idea for &quot;Bloodsport&quot;. Frank told me a lot of tall tales, most of which turned out to be bullshit. But his stories about participating in this so-called &quot;Kumite&quot; event sounded like a great idea for a movie. There was one guy who he introduced me to, named Richard Bender, who claimed to have actually been at the Kumite event and who swore everything Frank told me was true. A few years later this guy had a falling-out with Frank, and confessed to me that everything he told me about the Kumite was a lie; Frank had coached him in what to say.

On casting the lead role, producer Mark DiSalle said, &quot;I wanted a new martial arts star who was a ladies&#x27; man. Jean Claude [Van Damme] appeals to both men and women. He&#x27;s an American hero who fights for justice the American way and kicks the stuffing out of the bad guys.&quot;

=== Filming ===
&quot;Bloodsport&quot; was filmed entirely on location in Hong Kong during late 1986. Shooting began on October 17, 1986. It was the first American feature film made in Hong Kong since 1969. Promotional materials indicated that the &quot;Kumite&quot; which Frank Dux won in 1975 was held in the Bahamas, but producers opted to set the story in Hong Kong because the city was &quot;exciting and not over-exposed&quot; in American films.

&quot;Bloodsport&quot; is one of the few films featuring scenes filmed inside Kowloon Walled City before its demolition in 1993. Other locations included The Peninsula Hotel, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong Trail, Victoria Peak, and Stanley Fort.

=== Soundtrack ===
&quot;Bloodsport&quot;″s soundtrack score was composed by Paul Hertzog, who would also compose the score for Jean-Claude Van Damme&#x27;s next movie &quot;Kickboxer&quot;. For the movie &quot;Bloodsport&quot; the songs &quot;Fight to Survive&quot; and &quot;On My Own&quot; were both performed by Stan Bush. Bush&#x27;s performances are replaced on the soundtrack with alternate versions sung by Paul Delph. Due to this work Paul Delph was nominated for a Grammy. The film plays the song &quot;Steal the Night&quot; by Michael Bishop during a scene where Dux runs from Helmer and Rawlins. The song was released in the mid-2000s as a single containing a vocal and instrumental version. On June 26, 2007, Perseverance Records released a limited-edition CD of the soundtrack including, for the first time, the original film versions of the Stan Bush songs. In 2021 the complete soundtrack was released on picture discs by Waxwork Records.

== Home media ==
&quot;Bloodsport&quot; was released on VHS and Betamax by Warner Home Video on December 21, 1988. Within a few months, it had sold some 150,000 units.

Warner also released a DVD of the film in the United States on October 1, 2002.

Multiple Bluray versions have been released throughout the years, the earliest in 2010 and the latest, including 4K versions, in 2023 and beyond. The older releases feature only stereo audio, while the most recent ones also surround mixes.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
In January 1989, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported a U.S. box office gross of $11.7 million against a budget of $2.3 million. In August 1989, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that the film pulled in $50 million worldwide, including $15 million in the U.S. and Canada, making it Cannon Group&#x27;s most profitable film of 1988.

=== Critical response ===
Leonard Klady of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Hacking through the jungle of cliche and reservoir of bad acting in &quot;Bloodsport&quot; [...] are some pretty exciting matches.&quot;

Van Damme was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst New Star, but lost to Ronald McDonald in &quot;Mac and Me&quot;.

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports a 48% approval rating based on 29 reviews and an average rating of 5.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;This is where it all began for the Muscles from Brussels, but beyond Van Damme&#x27;s athleticism, &quot;Bloodsport&quot; is a clichéd, virtually plotless exercise in action movie recycling.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 29 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Slashfilm regards it as one of the most influential martial arts movies of all time.

== Sequels and possible remake ==
&quot;Bloodsport&quot; has become regarded as a cult film. Though Jean-Claude Van Damme doesn&#x27;t appear in additional installments, it was followed by three sequels: &quot;Bloodsport II: The Next Kumite&quot; (1996), &quot;Bloodsport III&quot; (1997), and &quot;Bloodsport 4: The Dark Kumite&quot; (1999).

A remake of &quot;Bloodsport&quot; was reported to be in planning in 2011. Phillip Noyce was attached to direct a screenplay by Robert Mark Kamen. The main character was supposed to be an American Afghanistan War veteran competing in a vale tudo tournament in Brazil. Director James McTeigue was attached to the project by 2013, and the filming was to be done in Australia and Brazil. As of 2023, the remake has not been produced.

== Legacy ==
According to the American Film Institute, the success of &quot;Bloodsport&quot; helped the resurgence of the martial arts film genre in America. According to Jean-Claude Van Damme, the film &quot;helped give the martial arts genre a boost but also foretold certain things like the Ultimate Fighting Championship and the idea of pitting different styles against each other.&quot;

Retired professional mixed martial artist and kickboxer Mirko Cro Cop, inspired by Van Damme&#x27;s performance in the film, began training in his parents&#x27; garage with his father&#x27;s boxing equipment and weights.

&quot;Bloodsport&quot; was an inspiration for the video game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, and Johnny Cage, one of the characters, is a parody of Jean-Claude Van Damme. Van-Damme himself later voiced a Johnny Cage character based on his likeness in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;.

In 2024, Capelight Pictures released &quot;The Last Kumite&quot;, a crowd-funded film &quot;inspired by the likes of Bloodsport, &quot;Kickboxer&quot; and &quot;No Retreat No Surrender&quot;&quot;. Several people with ties to the original films were attached to the project, including Kurt McKinney, Michel Qissi, and Bolo Yeung&#x27;s son David Yeung.
