<text>The &quot;Canopus&quot; class was a group of six pre-dreadnought battleships of the British Royal Navy built in the late 1890s. The ships were designed by the Director of Naval Construction, William White, for use on the China Station. The class comprised , the lead ship, and , , , , and . The class was armed with a main battery of four BL 12 inch Mk VIII naval guns and a secondary battery of twelve QF 6-inch guns. Compared to the preceding s, the &quot;Canopus&quot; class was smaller, faster, and less heavily armoured, though they adopted new, stronger Krupp armour, which was more effective than the Harvey steel used in the &quot;Majestic&quot;s. In addition to the Krupp steel, the ships also adopted several other changes, including water-tube boilers, in-line funnels, and a full-length armoured belt.

The six ships of the &quot;Canopus&quot; class served abroad for much of their early careers, with all six of them seeing service on the China Station in the early 1900s. In addition, &quot;Canopus&quot; also served with the Mediterranean Fleet during this period. In 1905, with the signing of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the Royal Navy withdrew most of its heavy units from the Far East, and the six &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships returned to British waters, seeing further service with the Home, Channel, and the Atlantic Fleets through 1908. From then to 1910, most of the ships saw service with the Mediterranean Fleet, before being reduced to reserve status or other secondary duties thereafter.

With Britain&#x27;s entry into the First World War in August 1914, the ships were mobilised as the 8th Battle Squadron, but they were quickly dispersed to other stations, serving as guard ships and convoy escorts. &quot;Canopus&quot; participated in the hunt for the German East Asia Squadron, which culminated in the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914. In early 1915, most of the ships were sent to the eastern Mediterranean Sea to take part in the Dardanelles Campaign against the Ottoman Empire. During these operations, &quot;Ocean&quot; and &quot;Goliath&quot; were sunk, in March and May 1915, respectively. &quot;Canopus&quot; and &quot;Albion&quot; were withdrawn from active service in 1916, thereafter being used as barracks ships. &quot;Glory&quot; served as the flagship of the British North Russia Squadron, while &quot;Vengeance&quot; took part in operations off German East Africa in 1916. After the war, all four survivors were quickly broken up in the early 1920s.

==Design==

Design work began on what became the &quot;Canopus&quot; class in March 1895, when William Henry White, the Director of Naval Construction, presented the design for the Japanese s then being built in Britain to the Board of Admiralty. These ships, which were based on the British , represented a marked increase in Japanese naval power in East Asia, and White argued that more powerful battleships would be required on the China Station to counter them. He also suggested that the new design be capable of transiting the Suez Canal to reduce transit time between Europe and Asia. The Board concurred, and on 13 May again met White to provide their requirements for the new ships. Two days later, White relayed the parameters for the ships to his staff, along with instructions to prepare a suitable design as quickly as possible. The new ships were to have a freeboard equal to that of the battleship , the same main battery as the preceding s, a secondary battery of ten guns, the speed and fuel capacity as the second-class battleship , and an armoured belt that was 6 inches thick.

White and his staff prepared a preliminary design sketch on 23 May, which they submitted to the Admiralty. This vessel was to carry the specified battery of four guns and ten 6-inch guns on a displacement of . Speed was to be from . Further work to refine the design continued, and three variants were created: &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;. &quot;A&quot; reduced displacement slightly to , but kept the same armament and speed. &quot;B&quot; was broadly similar to the original design, but added two 6-inch guns, and &quot;C&quot; was slightly smaller, along the lines of &quot;A&quot;, but its secondary battery consisted of eight 6-inch guns and eight guns. The three variants were submitted to the Admiralty in early October; on the 9th, the Board sent its reply to White, instructing him to prepare a new design that combined the armour layout of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; with the secondary battery of &quot;B&quot;.

Design work continued for almost a year before the final version was approved on 2 September 1896. By this time, the Board had decided to adopt new water-tube boilers after they had been successfully tested aboard the torpedo gunboat . The armour layout was further revised, with the final version discarding the thinner side armour above the belt, along with the aft strake of armour; the main and secondary guns also had their armour protection reduced. These reductions were used to increase the thickness of the forward strake and the main deck and to place four of the secondary guns in armoured casemates. Though the thickness of the armour layout was much reduced compared to the preceding &quot;Majestic&quot; class, the adoption of new Krupp steel
in place of the Harvey steel allowed for only a modest decrease in protection.

Six vessels, rated as first-class battleships, were authorized to be built to the new design in the 1896 and 1897 estimates. Though the armour scheme was not as weak as it appeared on paper, the Royal Navy was not pleased with the reduction in defensive power. White&#x27;s department regarded them as second-class battleships, and they were indeed classified as &quot;improved &quot;Renown&quot;s&quot; in the 1896 estimates. Nevertheless, they matched the &quot;Fuji&quot;s they were intended to counter, and they represented the maximum offensive and defensive capabilities possible on the displacement and draught restrictions imposed by the Admiralty. They proved more than capable of performing the task for which they had been built on the China Station.

===General characteristics===
The ships of the &quot;Canopus&quot; class were long between perpendiculars and long overall, with a beam of . They had a draft of normally and up to fully loaded. They displaced normally and up to at full load. The ships were fitted with two masts, each with one fighting top carrying several of the light guns and one searchlight. Four other searchlights were mounted on the bridges.

Their crew numbered 682 officers and ratings on completion, but the number varied throughout the ships&#x27; careers. For example, by 1904, &quot;Goliath&quot;″s crew had increased to 737 and &quot;Albion&quot; had a crew of 752, which included an admiral&#x27;s staff. While serving as a gunnery training ship in 1912, &quot;Vengeance&quot; had a crew of just 400, while &quot;Albion&quot; was reduced to 371 officers and sailors as a guard ship in 1916. Each ship carried a number of small boats, including two steam pinnaces and one sail pinnace, one steam launch, three cutters, one galley, one whaler, three gigs, two dinghies, and one raft.

===Propulsion===
The &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove a pair of inward-turning screw propellers, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with water-tube boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of two fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the &quot;Majestic&quot;s. The increase in speed came primarily from the water-tube boilers, which produced an extra compared to the older fire-tube boilers of the &quot;Majestic&quot;s. The inward-turning screws also provided an increase in speed, since they could be operated at higher revolutions than the outward-turning screws used in earlier ships.

Each ship had a fuel capacity of of coal under normal conditions, but additional spaces could be used to double capacity, for during wartime. The ships burned of coal steaming at for 24 hours and up to at full speed every 24 hours. The &quot;Canopus&quot;es were able to reach at an economical cruising speed of with a full load of coal. While steaming at , the range fell significantly to .

Though the water-tube boilers significantly increased performance, they were plagued with problems throughout the ships&#x27; careers. &quot;Ocean&quot;″s boiler condenser tubes leaked badly until a refit in 1902–1903 corrected the problem. &quot;Vengeance&quot; similarly suffered throughout her service life, which reduced the efficiency of her engines. The inward-turning screws also caused problems in service, as they made steering difficult at low speed or when steaming in reverse; the arrangement proved to be unpopular with crews as a result. Regardless, the Royal Navy retained inward-turning screws in all future pre-dreadnought battleships, before returning to outward-turning propellers for in 1906.

===Armament===
The ships of the &quot;Canopus&quot; class had four 12-inch 35-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading, although at a fixed elevation. &quot;Canopus&quot; carried her guns in BIII mountings, the same used in the last two &quot;Majestic&quot;-class ships, while the next four vessels used the newer BIV mounts, and &quot;Vengeance&quot; used newer-still BV mountings. The BIII mounts featured a deck that interrupted the shell and propellant hoists to prevent the flash fire from an explosion in the turret from easily reaching down to the magazines, which could produce a catastrophic explosion. The BIV mounts eliminated this deck to allow for faster ammunition handling, but the designers realized the greatly increased risk this entailed, and so restored the deck with the BV mounts. To improve shell handling speed, a new turret was developed by Vickers for &quot;Vengeance&quot; that allowed for reloading the guns at all elevations, which eliminated the need to return to the fixed loading elevation, improving her rate of fire significantly.

The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 6-inch 40-calibre guns mounted in casemates. Eight of the 6-inch guns were mounted in the main deck, which placed them too low to give them a good field of fire, though the other four guns, mount a deck higher, did not suffer from the same problem. For close-range defence against torpedo boats, the ships carried a tertiary battery of ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns in individual mounts, distributed along the length of the ships, including in casemates in the bow and stern and in pivot mounts in the superstructure.

As was customary for battleships of the period, they were also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull, two on each broadside near the forward and aft barbette. A fifth tube had been planned at the ship&#x27;s stern, above the water, but it was eliminated during construction. This was likely done because the above-water tubes could not be adequately protected, and if a torpedo exploded while it was still in the tube, it could have done serious damage to the ship.

===Armour===

To save weight, &quot;Canopus&quot; carried less armour than the &quot;Majestic&quot;s—6 inches in the belt compared to —although the change from Harvey armour in the &quot;Majestic&quot;s to Krupp armour in &quot;Canopus&quot; meant that the loss in protection was not as great as it might have been, Krupp armour having 30 percent greater protective value at a given weight than its Harvey equivalent. Though it was thinner, it was more comprehensive; the &quot;Canopus&quot; class was the first British capital ship to return to a full-length armoured belt since , launched in 1875. To save weight, the belt was reduced to at either end of the ship. As with the belt, the other armour used to protect the ships could also be thinner; the bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick.

They were fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively, both of which were Harvey steel. This was the first time a second armour deck was installed in a British warship. At the time the design was being prepared, rumours circulated that the French intended to equip their newest battleships with howitzers, which fired shells at high angles; this would allow them to hit British ships with plunging fire, avoiding the ships&#x27; heavy belt armour. The French did not place howitzers on any of their new ships, but the adoption of two armour decks was continued in British practice until the s of the 1920s.

The main battery turrets were thick with 2 in thick roofs, atop 10 to 12 in barbettes. The barbettes reduced to 6 in behind the belt. Not all sections of the ships received the Krupp steel; the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Harvey steel on the fronts, and 2 in on the sides and the rears. Their forward conning towers received Harvey steel for their sides that were 12 in thick, while the aft conning towers had only sides.

The thinner armour layout of the ships came under intense criticism while they were being built, particularly in the press. White publicly defended the design, pointing out that recent experience between Chinese and Japanese warships at the Battle of the Yalu River demonstrated that armour proved to be more effective in protecting ships than proving ground tests would indicate, and the advances in armour technology warranted the reduction in service of saving weight for better weapons.

==Service history==
===Pre-war===
The ships of the class spent much of their peacetime career abroad. &quot;Canopus&quot; spent her early career in the Mediterranean Fleet, while &quot;Goliath&quot; went to the China Station in 1900. &quot;Glory&quot;, &quot;Albion&quot;, and &quot;Ocean&quot; joined &quot;Goliath&quot; from 1901 to 1905, and &quot;Vengeance&quot; and &quot;Canopus&quot; was sent to join them in 1902 and 1905, respectively. In September 1902, &quot;Ocean&quot; was damaged by a typhoon. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance signed in 1905 allowed Britain to withdraw much of her East Asian naval strength, and the &quot;Canopus&quot;-class ships were recalled to European waters. On their return to Britain, most of them served brief stints with the Channel Fleet and then the Home Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet between 1905 and 1907. During this period, the ships also underwent major overhauls after their extended periods of service overseas. &quot;Goliath&quot; instead went to the Mediterranean Fleet from 1903 to 1906, followed by periods with the Channel Fleet and Home Fleet in 1906 and 1907, respectively.

&quot;Canopus&quot;, &quot;Glory&quot;, &quot;Ocean&quot;, and &quot;Goliath&quot; were sent to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1908, where they remained until the end of the decade. On 13 June 1908, &quot;Vengeance&quot; was damaged in a collision with the merchant ship at Portsmouth; she was involved in another collision on 29 November 1910 with the merchant vessel . Several of the ships, including &quot;Canopus&quot; and &quot;Glory&quot; were reduced to reserve status on their return to Britain, where they remained until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. &quot;Ocean&quot;, meanwhile, again served with the Home Fleet but saw little activity until the outbreak of war. &quot;Vengeance&quot;, for her part, served in secondary roles from 1908, including as a tender and a gunnery training ship. In 1913, she was transferred to the 6th Battle Squadron of the Second Fleet.

===First World War===
At the beginning of the First World War, the ships of the &quot;Canopus&quot; class were mobilised for service with the 8th Battle Squadron. &quot;Canopus&quot; was quickly sent to the South America Station, where she patrolled for German commerce raiders. She was involved in the search for the German East Asia Squadron of Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee. Too slow to follow Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock&#x27;s cruisers, she missed the Battle of Coronel in November 1914, where Cradock was defeated. Moored at Port Stanley as a defensive battery, she fired the first shots of the Battle of the Falklands in December, which led Spee to break off the attack before being chased down and destroyed by Admiral Doveton Sturdee&#x27;s battlecruisers.

At the start of the conflict, &quot;Ocean&quot; was stationed in Ireland to support a cruiser squadron, but in October she was transferred to the East Indies Station to protect troopship convoys from India. &quot;Goliath&quot; initially served as a guard ship in Loch Ewe, one of the harbors used by the Grand Fleet, before escorting the crossing of British troops to Belgium in late August. She then took part in operations against German East Africa, participating in the blockade of the German light cruiser in the Rufiji River. In October 1914, &quot;Glory&quot; was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station, where she served as the squadron flagship. In late 1914, &quot;Ocean&quot; participated in an attack on Basra before being transferred to Egypt to defend the Suez Canal, where she joined &quot;Vengeance&quot;, which had been there since November. &quot;Albion&quot; was sent to the Atlantic to help defend against the possibility of German warships breaking out of the North Sea. In December and January 1915, she supported operations against German Southwest Africa.

====Dardanelles campaign====
&quot;Canopus&quot;, &quot;Albion&quot;, &quot;Ocean&quot;, and &quot;Vengeance&quot; were transferred to the Mediterranean in early 1915 for the Dardanelles Campaign. They participated in major attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in March 1915, but the British and French fleets proved incapable of forcing the straits. These included major attacks on 18 March that saw the loss of one French and two British battleships—one of which was &quot;Ocean&quot;—to Ottoman naval mines. &quot;Ocean&quot; had been attempting to rescue the crew from the battleship , which had also struck a mine, when she too was mined and sank. Most of her crew was able to evacuate to nearby destroyers. The surviving ships were repeatedly damaged by Ottoman coastal guns during these operations, but none seriously so. Allied infantry landed in April, beginning the Gallipoli campaign, and &quot;Canopus&quot; continued to bombard Ottoman positions to support them. These operations included the First Battle of Krithia and helping defeat Ottoman counter-attacks. On 13 May 1915 &quot;Goliath&quot; was sunk in Morto Bay off Cape Helles by three torpedoes from the Ottoman destroyer . Out of her crew of 750, 570 were killed in the sinking. In June 1915, &quot;Glory&quot; was reassigned to the Mediterranean to join her sisters in the campaign, though she saw little action during that time, as her crew was needed ashore to support the troops fighting on the peninsula.

====Later careers====
In October 1915, &quot;Albion&quot; was transferred to Salonika to support the Allied operations against Bulgaria through then-neutral Greece, but she saw no further action. She was transferred back to Ireland in April 1916 for service as a guard ship, a role she filled until October 1918, when she was reduced to a barracks ship. After the Gallipoli campaign ended with the withdrawal of Allied forces in January 1916, &quot;Canopus&quot; patrolled the eastern Mediterranean, but saw no further action. She was removed from service in April 1916 and was converted into a barracks ship in early 1918. In August 1916, &quot;Glory&quot; was sent to Murmansk, Russia, to support Britain&#x27;s ally by keeping the vital port open for supplies being sent for the Eastern Front. There, she served as the flagship of the British North Russia Squadron. Worn out from operations off Gallipoli, &quot;Vengeance&quot; returned to Britain for a refit. She was recommissioned in December 1915 for service in East Africa, during which she supported the capture of Dar es Salaam in German East Africa. She returned to Britain again in 1917 and was decommissioned, thereafter serving in subsidiary roles until 1921.

After the war, the Royal Navy began discarding the ships. &quot;Albion&quot; was sold for scrap in December 1919 and broken up the following year, as was &quot;Canopus&quot;. &quot;Glory&quot; returned to Britain in 1919, was decommissioned, and was renamed HMS &quot;Crescent&quot; in 1920, before ultimately being sold to ship breakers in December 1922. &quot;Vengeance&quot; was sold for scrap in 1921 and broken up the next year.

<text>The Siberian tiger or Amur tiger is a population of the tiger subspecies &quot;Panthera tigris tigris&quot; native to Northeast China, the Russian Far East, and possibly North Korea. It once ranged throughout the Korean Peninsula, but currently inhabits mainly the Sikhote-Alin mountain region in south-west Primorye Province in the Russian Far East. In 2005, there were 331–393 adult and subadult Siberian tigers in this region, with a breeding adult population of about 250 individuals. The population had been stable for more than a decade because of intensive conservation efforts, but partial surveys conducted after 2005 indicate that the Russian tiger population was declining. An initial census held in 2015 indicated that the Siberian tiger population had increased to 480–540 individuals in the Russian Far East, including 100 cubs. This was followed up by a more detailed census which revealed there was a total population of 562 wild Siberian tigers in Russia. As of 2014, about 35 individuals were estimated to range in the international border area between Russia and China.

The Siberian tiger is genetically close to the now-extinct Caspian tiger. Results of a phylogeographic study comparing mitochondrial DNA from Caspian tigers and living tiger populations indicate that the common ancestor of the Siberian and Caspian tigers colonized Central Asia from eastern China, via the Gansu−Silk Road corridor, and then subsequently traversed Siberia eastward to establish the Siberian tiger population in the Russian Far East. The Caspian and Siberian tiger populations were the northernmost in mainland Asia.

The Siberian tiger was also called &quot;Amur tiger&quot;, &quot;Manchurian tiger&quot;, &quot;Korean tiger&quot;, and &quot;Ussurian tiger&quot;, depending on the region where individuals were observed.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Felis tigris&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the tiger. In the 19th century, several tiger specimens were collected in East Asia and described:
*&quot;Felis tigris altaicus&quot; proposed by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1844 were tiger skins with long hairs and dense coats sold in Japan, which originated in Korea, most likely from animals killed in the Altai and Pisihan Mountains.
*&quot;Tigris longipilis&quot; proposed by Leopold Fitzinger in 1868 was based on a long-haired tiger skin in the Natural History Museum, Vienna. 
*&quot;Felis tigris&quot; var. &quot;amurensis&quot; proposed by Charles Dode in 1871 was based on tiger skins from the Amur region.
*&quot;Felis tigris coreensis&quot; by Emil Brass in 1904 was a tiger skin from Korea.

The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999. Most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th centuries were distinguished on the basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size – characteristics that vary widely within populations. Morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little, and gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the Pleistocene. Therefore, it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely &quot;Panthera tigris tigris&quot; in mainland Asia, and &quot;P. t. sondaica&quot; in the Greater Sunda Islands and possibly in Sundaland.
In 2015, morphological, ecological and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction of the two evolutionary groups: continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies: namely &quot;P. t. tigris&quot; comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations; and &quot;P. t. sondaica&quot; comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations.

In 2017, the Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and now recognizes all the tiger populations in mainland Asia as &quot;P. t. tigris&quot;.

=== Phylogeny ===
Several reports have been published since the 1990s on the genetic makeup of the Siberian tiger and its relationship to other populations. One of the most important outcomes has been the discovery of low genetic variability in the wild population, especially when it comes to maternal or mitochondrial DNA lineages. It seems that a single mtDNA haplotype almost completely dominates the maternal lineages of wild Siberian tigers. On the other hand, captive tigers appear to show higher mtDNA diversity. This may suggest that the subspecies has experienced a very recent genetic bottleneck caused by human pressure, with the founders of the captive population having been captured when genetic variability was higher in the wild.

At the start of the 21st century, researchers from the University of Oxford, U.S. National Cancer Institute and Hebrew University of Jerusalem collected tissue samples from 20 of 23 Caspian tiger specimens kept in museums across Eurasia. They sequenced at least one segment of five mitochondrial genes and found a low amount of variability of the mitochondrial DNA in Caspian tigers as compared to other tiger subspecies. They re-assessed the phylogenetic relationships of tiger subspecies and observed a remarkable similarity between Caspian and Siberian tigers, indicating that the Siberian tiger is the genetically closest living relative of the Caspian tiger, which strongly implies a very recent common ancestry. Based on phylogeographic analysis, they suggested that the ancestor of Caspian and Siberian tigers colonized Central Asia less than 10,000 years ago via the Gansu−Silk Road region from eastern China, and subsequently traversed eastward to establish the Siberian tiger population in the Russian Far East. The events of the Industrial Revolution may have been the critical factor in the reciprocal isolation of Caspian and Siberian tigers from what was likely a single contiguous population.

Samples of 95 wild Amur tigers were collected throughout their native range to investigate questions relative to population genetic structure and demographic history. Additionally, targeted individuals from the North American &quot;ex situ&quot; population were sampled to assess the genetic representation found in captivity. Population genetic and Bayesian structure analyses clearly identified two populations separated by a development corridor in Russia. Despite their well-documented 20th century decline, the researchers failed to find evidence of a recent population bottleneck, although genetic signatures of a historical contraction were detected. This disparity in signal may be due to several reasons, including historical paucity in population genetic variation associated with postglacial colonisation and potential gene flow from an extirpated Chinese population. The extent and distribution of genetic variation in captive and wild populations were similar, yet gene variants persisted &quot;ex situ&quot; that were lost &quot;in situ&quot;. Overall, their results indicate the need to secure ecological connectivity between the two Russian populations to minimize loss of genetic diversity and overall susceptibility to stochastic events, and support a previous study suggesting that the captive population may be a reservoir of gene variants lost &quot;in situ&quot;.

In 2013, the whole genome of the Siberian tiger was sequenced and published. Tigers in mainland Asia fall into two clades: the northern clade comprises the Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and the southern clade all remaining continental tiger populations. A study published in 2018 was based on 32 tiger specimens using a whole-genome sequencing for analysis. Results support six monophyletic tiger clades and indicate that the most recent common ancestor lived about 110,000 years ago.

== Characteristics ==

The tiger is reddish-rusty, or rusty-yellow in colour, with narrow black transverse stripes. The body length is not less than , condylobasal length of skull , zygomatic width , and length of upper carnassial tooth over long. It has an extended supple body standing on rather short legs with a fairly long tail.

=== Body size ===
In the 1980s, the typical weight range of wild Siberian tigers was indicated as for males and for females. Exceptionally large individuals were targeted and shot by hunters.

In 2005, a group of Russian, American and Indian zoologists published an analysis of historical and contemporary data on body weights of wild and captive tigers, both female and male across all subspecies. The data used include weights of tigers that were older than 35 months and measured in the presence of authors. Their comparison with historical data indicates that up to the first half of the 20th century both male and female Siberian tigers were on average heavier than post-1970 ones. The average historical wild male Siberian tiger weighed and the female ; the contemporary wild male Siberian tiger weighs on average with an asymptotic limit being ; a wild female weighs on average. Historical Siberian tigers and Bengal tigers were the largest ones, whereas contemporary Siberian tigers are on average lighter than Bengal tigers. The reduction of the body weight of today&#x27;s Siberian tigers may be explained by concurrent causes, namely the reduced abundance of prey because of illegal hunting and that the individuals were usually sick or injured and captured in a conflict situation with people.

Measurements taken by scientists of the &quot;Siberian Tiger Project&quot; in the Sikhote-Alin range from in head and body length measured in straight line, with an average of for males; and for females ranging from with an average of . The average tail measures in males and in females. The longest male measured in total length including a tail of and with a chest girth of . The longest female measured in total length including tail of and with a chest girth of .
A male captured by members of the &quot;Siberian Tiger Project&quot; weighed , and the largest radio-collared male weighed .

The Siberian tiger is often considered to be the largest tiger.
A wild male, killed in Manchuria by the Sungari River in 1943, reportedly measured &quot;over the curves&quot;, with a tail length of about . It weighed about . Dubious sources mention weights of and even .

=== Skull ===
The skull of the Siberian tiger is characterized by its large size. The facial region is very powerful and very broad in the region of the canines. The skull prominences, especially in the sagittal crest and crista occipitalis, are very high and strong in old males, and often much more massive than usually observed in the biggest skulls of Bengal tigers. The size variation in skulls of Siberian tigers ranges from in nine individuals measured. A female skull is always smaller and never as heavily built and robust as that of a male. The height of the sagittal crest in its middle part reaches as much as , and in its posterior part up to .

Female skulls range from . The skulls of male Caspian tigers from Turkestan had a maximum length of , while that of females measured . A tiger killed on the Sumbar River in Kopet Dag in January 1954 had a greatest skull length of , which is considerably more than the known maximum for this population and slightly exceeds that of most Siberian tigers. However, its condylobasal length was only , smaller than those of the Siberian tigers, with a maximum recorded condylobasal length of . The biggest skull of a Siberian tiger from northeast China measured in length, which is about more than the maximum skull lengths of tigers from the Amur region and northern India, with the exception of a skull of a northern Indian tiger from the vicinity of Nagina, which measured &quot;over the bone&quot;.

=== Fur and coat ===

The ground colour of Siberian tigers&#x27; pelage is often very pale, especially in winter coat. However, variations within populations may be considerable. Individual variation is also found in form, length, and partly in colour, of the dark stripes, which have been described as being dark brown rather than black.

The fur of the Siberian tiger is moderately thick, coarse and sparse compared to that of other felids living in the former Soviet Union. Compared to the extinct westernmost populations, the Siberian tiger&#x27;s summer and winter coats contrast sharply with other subspecies. Generally, the coat of western populations was brighter and more uniform than that of the Far Eastern populations. The summer coat is coarse, while the winter coat is denser, longer, softer, and silkier. The winter fur often appears quite shaggy on the trunk and is markedly longer on the head, almost covering the ears. Siberian and Caspian tigers had the thickest fur amongst tigers.

The whiskers and hair on the back of the head and the top of the neck are also greatly elongated. The background colour of the winter coat is generally less bright and rusty compared to that of the summer coat. Because of the winter fur&#x27;s greater length, the stripes appear broader with less defined outlines. The summer fur on the back is long, along the top of the neck, on the abdomen, and on the tail. The winter fur on the back is , on the top of the neck, on the throat, on the chest and on the abdomen. The whiskers are .

== Distribution and habitat ==

The Siberian tiger once inhabited much of the Korean Peninsula, Manchuria and other parts of north-eastern China, the eastern part of Siberia and the Russian Far East, perhaps as far west as Mongolia and the area of Lake Baikal, where the Caspian tiger also reportedly occurred.
During the late Pleistocene and Holocene, it was likely connected to the South China tiger population through corridors in the Yellow River basin, before humans interrupted gene flow.

Today, its range stretches south to north for almost the length of Primorsky Krai and into southern Khabarovsk Krai east and south of the Amur River. It also occurs within the Greater Xing&#x27;an Range, which crosses into Russia from China at several places in southwest Primorye. This region represents a merger zone of the East Asian temperate broadleaf and mixed forest and the taiga, resulting in a mosaic of forest types that vary in elevation and topography. Key habitats of the Siberian tiger are Korean pine forests with a complex composition and structure.

The faunal complex of the region is represented by a mixture of Asian and boreal life forms. The ungulate complex is represented by seven species, with Manchurian wapiti, Siberian roe deer, and wild boar being the most common throughout the Sikhote-Alin mountains but rare in higher altitude spruce-fir forests. Sika deer are restricted to the southern half of the Sikhote-Alin mountains. Siberian musk deer and Amur moose are associated with the conifer forests and are near the southern limits of their distribution in the central Sikhote-Alin mountains.

In 2005, the number of Amur tigers in China was estimated at 18–22, and 331–393 in the Russian Far East, comprising a breeding adult population of about 250, fewer than 100 likely to be sub-adults, more than 20 likely to be less than 3 years of age. More than 90% of the population occurred in the Sikhote Alin mountain region. An unknown number of tigers survive in the reserve areas around Baekdu Mountain, on the border between China and North Korea, based on tracks and sightings.

In August 2012, a Siberian tiger with four cubs was recorded for the first time in northeastern China&#x27;s Hunchun National Nature Reserve located in the vicinity of the international borders with Russia and North Korea. Camera-trap surveys carried out in the spring seasons of 2013 and 2014 revealed between 27 and 34 tigers along the China-Russian border.
In April 2014, World Wide Fund for Nature personnel captured a video of a tigress with cubs in inland China.
The tiger population in the Changbai Mountains dispersed westwards between 2003 and 2016.
Camera trap surveys between 2013 and 2018 revealed about 55 Siberian tigers in four forested landscapes in northeastern China: Laoyeling, Zhangguangcai Range, Wandashan and Lesser Khingan Mountains. Feces, urine and hair was used to genetically identify 30 tigers in this region. However, only Laoyeling is thought to support a breeding population.

== Ecology and behavior ==

Siberian tigers are known to travel up to over ecologically unbroken country. In 1992 and 1993, the maximum total population density of the Sikhote-Alin tiger population was estimated at 0.62 tigers in . The maximum &quot;adult&quot; population estimated in 1993 reached 0.3 tigers in , with a sex ratio of averaging 2.4 females per male. These density values were much lower than what had been reported for other subspecies at the time.
In 2004, dramatic changes in land tenure, population density, and reproductive output in the core area of the Sikhote-Alin Zapovednik Siberian Tiger Project were detected, suggesting that when tigers are well protected from human-induced mortality for long periods, the adult female population density increases significantly. When more adult females survived, the mothers shared their home ranges with their daughters once the daughters reached maturity. By 2007, population density of tigers was estimated at 0.8±0.4 tigers in in the southern part of Sikhote-Alin Zapovednik, and 0.6±0.3 tigers in in the central part of the protected area.

Siberian tigers share habitat with Amur leopards (&quot;P. pardus orientalis&quot;), but in the Changbai Mountains have been recorded more often in lower elevations than leopards.

=== Hunting and diet ===

Prey species of the tiger include ungulates such as Manchurian wapiti (&quot;Cervus canadensis xanthopygus&quot;), Siberian musk deer (&quot;Moschus moschiferus&quot;), long-tailed goral (&quot;Naemorhedus caudatus&quot;), moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;), Siberian roe deer (&quot;Capreolus pygargus&quot;) and sika deer (&quot;Cervus nippon&quot;), wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), and even sometimes small size Asiatic black bears (&quot;Ursus thibetanus&quot;) and brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;). Siberian tigers also take smaller prey like hares, rabbits, pikas and even salmon. Scat was collected along the international border between Russia and China between November 2014 and April 2015; 115 scat samples of nine tigers contained foremost remains of wild boar, sika deer and roe deer.

Between January 1992 and November 1994, 11 tigers were captured, fitted with radio-collars and monitored for more than 15 months in the eastern slopes of the Sikhote-Alin mountain range. Results of this study indicate that their distribution is closely associated with distribution of Manchurian wapiti, while distribution of wild boar was not such a strong predictor for tiger distribution. Although they prey on both Siberian roe deer and sika deer, overlap of these ungulates with tigers was low. Distribution of moose was poorly associated with tiger distribution. The distribution of preferred habitat of key prey species was an accurate predictor of tiger distribution.

Results of a three-year study on Siberian tigers indicate that the mean interval between their kills and estimated prey consumption varied across seasons: during 2009 to 2012, three adult tigers killed prey every 7.4 days in summer and consumed a daily average of ; in winter they killed more large-bodied prey, made kills every 5.7 days and consumed a daily average of .

=== Interspecific predatory relationships ===
Following a decrease of ungulate populations from 1944 to 1959, 32 cases of Amur tigers attacking both Ussuri brown (&quot;Ursus arctos lasiotus&quot;) and Ussuri black bears (&quot;U. thibetanus ussuricus&quot;) were recorded in the Russian Far East, and hair of bears were found in several tiger scat samples. Tigers attack black bears less often than brown bears, as the latter live in more open habitats and are not able to climb trees. In the same time period, four cases of brown bears killing female tigers and young cubs were reported, both in disputes over prey and in self-defense. Tigers mainly feed on the bear&#x27;s fat deposits, such as the back, hams and groin.

When Amur tigers prey on brown bears, they usually target young and sub-adult bears, besides small female adults taken outside their dens, generally when lethargic from hibernation. Predation by tigers on denned brown bears was not detected during a study carried between 1993 and 2002. Ussuri brown bears, along with the smaller black bears constitute 2.1% of the Siberian tiger&#x27;s annual diet, of which 1.4% are brown bears.

The effect the presence of tigers has on brown bear behavior seems to vary. In the winters of 1970–1973, Yudakov and Nikolaev recorded two cases of bears showing no fear of tigers and another case of a brown bear changing path upon crossing tiger tracks. Other researchers have observed bears following tiger tracks to scavenge tiger kills and to potentially prey on tigers. Despite the threat of predation, some brown bears actually benefit from the presence of tigers by appropriating tiger kills that the bears may not be able to successfully hunt themselves. Brown bears generally prefer to contest the much smaller female tigers. During telemetry research in the Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve, 44 direct confrontations between bears and tigers were observed, in which bears in general were killed in 22 cases, and tigers in 12 cases. There are reports of brown bears specifically targeting Amur leopards and tigers to abstract their prey. In the Sikhote-Alin reserve, 35% of tiger kills were stolen by bears, with tigers either departing entirely or leaving part of the kill for the bear. Some studies show that bears frequently track down tigers to usurp their kills, with occasional fatal outcomes for the tiger. A report from 1973 describes twelve known cases of brown bears killing tigers, including adult males; in all cases the tigers were subsequently eaten by the bears.

The relationship between the Amur tiger and the Himalayan bear is not specifically studied. Numerous publications on these species there are mainly episodic and survey data on this issue are collected by different authors in selected areas which do not give a complete picture of the nature.

Tigers depress wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) numbers, either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem. Wolves appear capable of escaping competitive exclusion from tigers only when human pressure decreases tiger numbers. In areas where wolves and tigers share ranges, the two species typically display a great deal of dietary overlap, resulting in intense competition. Wolf and tiger interactions are well documented in Sikhote-Alin, where until the beginning of the 20th century, very few wolves were sighted. Wolf numbers may have increased in the region after tigers were largely eliminated during the Russian colonisation in the late 19th century and early 20th century. This is corroborated by native inhabitants of the region claiming that they had no memory of wolves inhabiting Sikhote-Alin until the 1930s, when tiger numbers decreased. Today, wolves are considered scarce in tiger habitat, being found in scattered pockets, and usually seen travelling as loners or in small groups. First hand accounts on interactions between the two species indicate that tigers occasionally chase wolves from their kills, while wolves will scavenge from tiger kills. Tigers are not known to prey on wolves, though there are four records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them. Tigers recently released are also said to hunt wolves.

This competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters in the Far East to tolerate the big cats, as they limit ungulate populations less than wolves, and are effective in controlling wolf numbers.

Siberian tigers also compete with the Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;) and occasionally kill and eat them. Eurasian lynx remains have been found in the stomach contents of Siberian tigers in Russia. In March 2014, a dead lynx discovered in Bastak Nature Reserve bore evidence of predation by a Siberian tiger. The tiger apparently ambushed, pursued, and killed the lynx but only consumed it partially. This incident marks one of the first documented cases of a tiger preying on a lynx, and indicates that the tiger might have been more intent on eliminating a competitor than on catching prey.

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===

Siberian tigers mate at any time of the year. A female signals her receptiveness by leaving urine deposits and scratch marks on trees. She will spend 5 or 6 days with the male, during which she is receptive for three days. Gestation lasts from 3 to 3½ months. Litter size is normally two or four cubs but there can be as many as six. The cubs are born blind in a sheltered and are left alone when the female leaves to hunt for food. Cubs are divided equally between sexes at birth. However, by adulthood there are usually two to four females for every male. The female cubs remain with their mothers longer, and later they establish territories close to their original ranges. Males, on the other hand, travel unaccompanied and range farther earlier in their lives, making them more vulnerable to poachers and other tigers.
A Siberian tiger family comprising an adult male, a female and three cubs were recorded in 2015.

At 35 months of age, tigers are sub-adults. Males reach sexual maturity at the age of 48 to 60 months.

The average lifespan for Siberian tigers ranges from 16–18 years. Wild individuals tend to live between 10–15 years, while in captivity individuals may live up to 25 years.

== Threats ==
Results of genetic analysis of 95 wild Siberian tiger samples from Russia revealed that genetic diversity is low, only 27–35 individuals contributed to their genes. Further exacerbating the problem is that more than 90% of the population occurred in the Sikhote Alin mountain region. Tigers rarely move across the development corridor, which separates this sub-population from the much smaller sub-population in southwest Primorye province.

The winter of 2006–2007 was marked by heavy poaching. Poaching of tigers and their wild prey species is considered to be driving the decline, although heavy snows in the winter of 2009 could have biased the data. In northern China’s Huang Ni He National Nature Reserve, poachers set up foremost snare traps, but there is not sufficient personnel to patrol this area throughout the year. In Hunchun National Nature Reserve, poaching of ungulate species impedes recovery of the tiger population.

=== In the past ===
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, illegal deforestation and bribery of park rangers facilitated poaching of Siberian tigers. Local hunters had access to a formerly sealed off lucrative Chinese market, and this once again put the region&#x27;s tiger population at risk of extinction. While improvement in the local economy has led to greater resources being invested in conservation efforts, an increase in economic activity has led to an increased rate of development and deforestation. The major obstacle in preserving the tiger is the enormous territory individual tigers require; up to is needed by a single female and more for a single male.

The Siberian tiger was once common in the Korean Peninsula. It was eradicated during the period of Korea under Japanese rule between 1910 and 1945.

== Conservation ==
Tigers are included on CITES Appendix I, banning international trade. All tiger range states and countries with consumer markets have banned domestic trade as well. At the 14th Conference of the Parties to CITES in 2007, stronger enforcement measures were called for, as well as an end to tiger farming.

In 1992, the &quot;Siberian Tiger Project&quot; was founded, with the aim of providing a comprehensive picture of the ecology of the Amur tiger and the role of tigers in the Russian Far East through scientific studies. By capturing and outfitting tigers with radio collars, their social structure, land use patterns, food habits, reproduction, mortality patterns and their relation with other inhabitants of the ecosystem, including humans is studied. These data compilations will hopefully contribute toward minimizing poaching threats because of traditional hunting. The &quot;Siberian Tiger Project&quot; has been productive in increasing local capacity to address human-tiger conflict with a &quot;Tiger Response Team&quot;, part of the Russian government&#x27;s &quot;Inspection Tiger&quot;, which responds to all tiger-human conflicts; by continuing to enhance the large database on tiger ecology and conservation with the goal of creating a comprehensive Siberian tiger conservation plan; and training the next generation of Russian conservation biologists.

In August 2010, China and Russia agreed to enhance conservation and cooperation in protected areas in a transboundary area for Amur tigers. China has undertaken a series of public awareness campaigns including celebration of the first &quot;Global Tiger Day&quot; in July 2010, and &quot;International Forum on Tiger Conservation and Tiger Culture&quot; and &quot;China 2010 Hunchun Amur Tiger Culture Festival&quot; in August 2010.

=== Reintroduction ===

Inspired by findings that the Amur tiger is the closest relative of the Caspian tiger, there has been discussion whether the Amur tiger could be an appropriate subspecies for reintroduction into a safe place in Central Asia. The Amu-Darya Delta was suggested as a potential site for such a project. A feasibility study was initiated to investigate if the area is suitable and if such an initiative would receive support from relevant decision makers. A viable tiger population of about 100 animals would require at least of large tracts of contiguous habitat with rich prey populations. Such habitat is not presently available in the delta and so cannot be provided in the short term. The proposed region is therefore unsuitable for the reintroduction, at least at this stage of development.
A second possible introduction site in Kazakhstan is the Ili River delta at the southern edge of Lake Balkhash. The delta is situated between the Saryesik-Atyrau Desert and the Taukum Desert and forms a large wetland of about . Until 1948, the delta was a refuge of the extinct Caspian tiger. Reintroduction of the Siberian tiger to the delta has been proposed. Large populations of wild boar inhabit the swamps of the delta. The reintroduction of the Bukhara deer, which was once an important prey, is under consideration. The Ili delta is therefore considered as a suitable site for introduction.

In 2010, Russia exchanged two captive Siberian tigers for Persian leopards with the Iranian government, as conservation groups of both countries agreed on reintroducing these animals into the wild within the next five years. This issue is controversial since only 30% of such releases have been successful. In addition, the Siberian tiger is not genetically identical to the Caspian tiger. Another difference is the climatic, with temperatures higher in Iran than in Siberia. Introducing exotic species into a new habitat could inflict irreversible and unknown damage. In December 2010, one of the tigers exchanged died in Eram Zoo in Tehran. Nevertheless, the project has its defenders, and Iran has successfully reintroduced the Persian onager and Caspian red deer.

In 2005, re-introduction was planned as part of the rewilding project at Pleistocene Park in the Kolyma River basin in northern Yakutia, Russia, provided the herbivore population has reached a size warranting the introduction of large predators.

=== In captivity ===

In recent years, captive breeding of tigers in China has accelerated to the point where the captive population of several tiger subspecies exceeds 4,000 animals. Three thousand specimens are reportedly held by 10–20 &quot;significant&quot; facilities, with the remainder scattered among some 200 facilities. This makes China home to the second largest captive tiger population in the world, after the U.S., which in 2005 had an estimated 4,692 captive tigers. In a census conducted by the U.S.-based Feline Conservation Federation, 2,884 tigers were documented as residing in 468 American facilities.

In 1986, the Chinese government established the world&#x27;s largest Siberian tiger breeding base, the Harbin Siberian Tiger Park, and was meant to build a Siberian tiger gene pool to ensure the genetic diversity of the tiger. The Park and its existing tiger population would be further divided into two parts, one as the protective species for genetic management and the other as the ornamental species. It was discovered that when the Heilongjiang Northeast Tiger Forest Park was founded it had only 8 tigers, but according to the current breeding rate of tigers at the park, the worldwide number of wild Siberian tigers will break through 1,000 in late 2010. South Korea expected to receive three tigers pledged for donation in 2009 by Russia in 2011.

== Attacks on humans ==
The Siberian tiger very rarely becomes a man-eater. Numerous cases of attacks on humans were recorded in the 19th century, occurring usually in central Asia excluding Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and the Far East. Tigers were historically rarely considered dangerous unless provoked, though in the lower reaches of the Syr-Darya, a tiger reportedly killed a woman collecting firewood and an unarmed military officer whilst passing through reed thickets. Attacks on shepherds were recorded in the lower reaches of Ili. In the Far East, during the middle and late 19th century, attacks on people were recorded. In 1867 on the Tsymukha River, tigers killed 21 men and injured 6 others. In China&#x27;s Jilin Province, tigers reportedly attacked woodsmen and coachmen, and occasionally entered cabins and dragged out both adults and children.
According to the Japanese Police Bureau in Korea, in 1928 a tiger killed one human, whereas leopards killed three, wild boars four and wolves killed 48. Six cases were recorded in 20th century Russia of unprovoked attacks leading to man-eating behaviour. Provoked attacks are however more common, usually the result of botched attempts at capturing them. In December 1997, an injured Amur tiger attacked, killed and consumed two people. Both attacks occurred in the Bikin River valley. The anti-poaching task force &quot;Inspection Tiger&quot; investigated both deaths, tracked down and killed the tiger.

In January 2002, a man was attacked by a tiger on a remote mountain road near Hunchun in Jilin province, China, near the borders of Russia and North Korea. He suffered compound fractures but managed to survive. When he sought medical attention, his story raised suspicions as Siberian tigers seldom attack humans. An investigation of the attack scene revealed that raw venison carried by the man was left untouched by the tiger. Officials suspected the man to be a poacher who provoked the attack. The following morning, tiger sightings were reported by locals along the same road, and a local TV station did an on-site coverage. The group found tiger tracks and blood spoor in the snow at the attack scene and followed them for approximately 2,500 meters, hoping to catch a glimpse of the animal. Soon, the tiger was seen ambling slowly ahead of them. As the team tried to get closer for a better camera view, the tiger suddenly turned and charged, causing the four to flee in panic. About an hour after that encounter, the tiger attacked and killed a 26-year-old woman on the same road. Authorities retrieved the body with the help of a bulldozer. By then, the tiger was found lying 20 meters away, weak and barely alive. It was successfully tranquilized and taken for examination, which revealed that the tiger was anemic and gravely injured by a poacher&#x27;s snare around its neck, with the steel wire cutting deeply down to the vertebrae, severing both trachea and esophagus. Despite extensive surgery by a team of veterinarians, the tiger died of wound infection. Subsequent investigation revealed that the first victim was a poacher who set multiple snares that caught both the tiger and a deer. The man was later charged for poaching and harming endangered species. He served two years in prison. After being released from prison, he worked in clearing the forest of old snares.

In an incident at the San Francisco Zoo in December 2007, a tiger escaped and killed a visitor, and injured two others. The animal was shot by the police. The zoo was widely criticized for maintaining only a fence around the tiger enclosure, while the international standard is . The zoo subsequently erected a taller barrier topped by an electric fence. One of the victims admitted to taunting the animal.

Zookeepers in Anhui province and the cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen were attacked and killed in 2010. In January 2011, a tiger attacked and killed a tour bus driver at a breeding park in Heilongjiang province. Park officials reported that the bus driver violated safety guidelines by leaving the vehicle to check on the condition of the bus. In September 2013, a tiger mauled a zookeeper to death at a zoo in western Germany after the worker forgot to lock a cage door during feeding time. In July 2020, a female tiger attacked and killed a 55-year-old zookeeper at the Zürich Zoo in Switzerland.

== In culture ==

The English name &#x27;Siberian tiger&#x27; was coined by James Cowles Prichard in the 1830s. The name &#x27;Amur tiger&#x27; was used in 1933 for Siberian tigers killed by the Amur River for an exhibition in the American Museum of Natural History.

The Tungusic peoples considered the tiger a near-deity and often referred to it as &quot;Grandfather&quot; or &quot;Old man&quot;. The Udege and Nanai people call it &quot;Amba&quot;. The Manchu considered the Siberian tiger as Hu Lin, the king. Since the tiger has a mark on its foreheads that looks like a Chinese character for &#x27;King&#x27; (), or a similar character meaning &quot;Great Emperor&quot;, it is revered by the Udege and Chinese people. The Siberian tiger is a national symbol of the Korean people due to its profound impact on traditional Korean culture.

<text>Woodlawn Beach State Park is a park located near the Village of Blasdell on the eastern shore of Lake Erie in Erie County, New York. It was opened as a state park in 1996 by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.

==History==
Woodlawn Beach was historically a popular swimming location and resort during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Served by several trains and steamships, Woodlawn Beach at this time featured a hotel, restaurant, dancing hall, bowling alley, billiards hall, toboggan slide and a picnic grove.

Access to the beach was restricted after the 1950s, when new owners disallowed public use of the land. The beach was once again opened to the public after New York State purchased of property from Buffalo Crushed Stone in 1996. The $6.3 million acquisition was made with the assistance of the Trust for Public Land.

The park was operated by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation prior to 2011. However, after a period of closure due to state budget constraints, since 2011 the park has been operated by the Town of Hamburg through a ten-year partnership agreement with New York State. Although still struggling to cover expenses, the town has had some success by marketing the park&#x27;s features, such as its beach, restaurant and banquet facilities. Losses had continued to decrease in the years that the town took over park operations.

The &quot;2010 Woodlawn Beach Sanitary Survey Report&quot; completed by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation notes several potential bacteria sources which may affect the beach, including sewage overflows, stormwater outfalls, urban runoff, contaminated stream drainage, algae and leafy debris. Woodlawn Beach was identified by the Natural Resources Defense Council as the third most polluted swimming beach in New York State after failing 32% of water sample tests in 2011.

==Facilities==
The park offers a beach, hiking, playground, picnic areas and a bar and restaurant. The park is available for parties and weddings. The Lodge is available by rental only.

The park is open for day use all year, but swimming is permitted only during summer months. The beach is open from dawn until dusk seven days a week beginning Memorial Day weekend and closes Labor Day weekend. There is a $7 parking fee. Active military (with ID) are discounted to $5 as well as motorcycles. Monday through Friday, senior citizens (62 years and older) may enter the park free of charge.

Pets are not permitted on the beach or in bathing areas. This is a statewide rule for all New York State operated parks. As of the summer of 2021, there is no alcohol permitted on the beach or in the parking lot.

The park accepts Empire Passes and Access Passes issued by New York State.

<doc id="543470" wikidata="Q808487" url="?curid=543470" title="Barney Miller">
<text>Barney Miller is an American sitcom television series set in a New York City Police Department police station on East 6th Street in Greenwich Village (Lower Manhattan). The series was broadcast on ABC from January 23, 1975, to May 20, 1982. It was created by Danny Arnold and Theodore J. Flicker. Noam Pitlik directed the majority of the episodes. It spawned a spin-off series, &quot;Fish&quot;, that ran from February 5, 1977, to May 18, 1978, focusing on the character Philip K. Fish.

==Premise==
&quot;Barney Miller&quot; takes place almost entirely within the confines of the detectives&#x27; squad room and Captain Barney Miller&#x27;s adjoining office of New York City&#x27;s fictional 12th Precinct, located in Manhattan&#x27;s Greenwich Village. A typical episode featured the detectives of the 12th bringing in several complainants or suspects to the squad room. Usually, there were two or three separate subplots in a given episode, with different officers dealing with different crimes. Rarely, about once a year, an episode would feature one or more of the detectives outside of the walls of the precinct, either on a stakeout or at their homes.

==Cast==

===Regulars===

===Recurring characters===

====Other officers and staff====
‡ 

====12th Precinct regulars====
The 12th Precinct had a number of regular complainants, habitués of the holding cell, or other people who often dropped by. Characters seen on three or more episodes included:
==Pilot==
The series was born out of an unsold television pilot, &quot;The Life and Times of Captain Barney Miller&quot;, that aired on August 22, 1974, as part of an ABC summer anthology series, &quot;Just for Laughs&quot;. Linden and Vigoda were cast in their series roles; no other eventual cast members were present. Abby Dalton played Barney Miller&#x27;s wife, Liz, while Val Bisoglio, Rod Perry, and a pre-&quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; Charles Haid rounded out the cast of the pilot. Guest stars included Mike Moore, Chu Chu Mulave, Henry Beckman, Buddy Lester, Michael Tessier and Anne Wyndham.

The pilot script was later largely reused in the debut episode &quot;Ramon&quot;. For this reworked episode, Bisoglio&#x27;s lines were more or less evenly split between the new characters of Yemana and Chano, while Haid&#x27;s character of Kazinski became Max Gail&#x27;s Wojciehowicz. Rod Perry&#x27;s character, Sgt. Wilson, was replaced by Harris in the reworked episode, although Wilson would reappear one more time in the first-season episode &quot;Experience&quot; before disappearing from the series entirely. Abby Dalton was replaced by Barbara Barrie as Liz, and Henry Beckman&#x27;s character of Uncle Charlie was dropped entirely. The rest of the guest cast (Moore, Malave, Lester, Tessier and Wyndham) reprised their roles in the debut episode.

Unlike the remainder of the series, the pilot was shot on film at CBS Studio Center, where the sets of the 12th Precinct and the Miller apartment were originally built. When the show went into regular production in late 1974, it was recorded on videotape. The sets were moved to the ABC Television Center in Hollywood, where they remained until production ended in 1982.

The pilot was never broadcast in syndication. It was released in 2011 as part of Shout Factory&#x27;s complete series set on DVD.

==Episodes==

==Opening theme==
The show&#x27;s theme music is an instrumental in a jazz fusion style, written by Jack Elliott and Allyn Ferguson. The theme opens with a distinctive bass line performed by studio musician Chuck Berghofer. The bass line was improvised by Berghofer at the request of producer Dominik Hauser: &quot;Can you do something on the bass? This guy is a cop in New York. Can we just start it out with the bass?&quot; Several versions of the theme were used during different seasons.

The theme plays over scenes of the Manhattan skyline, followed by shots of the characters and opening credits. Season 1 opened and closed with a shot of Midtown Manhattan as seen from Weehawken, New Jersey. Season 2 onward opened with a shot of Lower Manhattan as seen from Brooklyn Heights, with a barge being towed in the foreground, and closed with a shot of the Midtown Manhattan skyline as seen from Long Island City.

The theme song was ranked No. 23 and No. 27, respectively, by &quot;Complex&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; magazines, in their lists of &quot;best TV theme songs&quot;.

==Production==

===Staging===
Production of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; deliberately resembled a theatrical stage play; scenes rarely strayed from the precinct station&#x27;s squad room, with its prominent open-barred holding cell, and Miller&#x27;s adjoining office. The room was said to be on the second or third floor, depending on the episode. Clutter was plentiful and much of it seemed immobile over the years, including a coat hanging on a clothes rack near Harris&#x27; desk. A handful of episodes (fewer than a dozen of 170) were partially or fully set in other locations, including a stakeout location (&quot;Stakeout&quot;), a hospital room (&quot;Hair&quot;), an undercover operation (&quot;Grand Hotel&quot;), a jail (three separate rooms in &quot;Contempt&quot;), a hotel room (&quot;Chinatown&quot;), and the apartments of Barney (&quot;Ramon&quot; and &quot;Graft&quot;), Chano (&quot;The Hero&quot;), Fish (&quot;Fish&quot;) and Wojo (&quot;Wojo&#x27;s Girl&quot;). In &quot;The DNA Story&quot;, we finally see the inside of the men&#x27;s room. &quot;Barney Miller&quot; tended to obey two of the three classical unities of drama: unity of place and unity of time. The third unity, unity of action, was not followed, since each episode had multiple subplots.

&quot;Barney Miller&quot; was one of the few sitcoms of the period that occasionally mentioned the then-current year or allowed the audience to infer the then-current year.

===Taping===
&quot;Barney Miller&quot; was notorious for its marathon taping sessions. Early seasons were recorded before a live studio audience and used a laugh track for sweetening reactions during post-production. Creator and executive producer Danny Arnold would then rewrite and restage entire scenes after the audience departed, actively looking for quieter, subtler moments that would not play well before a crowd; a taping session that began in the afternoon or early evening would then continue into the early morning hours. Max Gail referred to this in the Jack Soo retrospective episode aired on May 17, 1979, remarking that one of the clips shown was a scene that &quot;we finished around 2:30 in the morning.&quot; In a 1977 blooper, a crew member mentions it being 3:15 a.m.

Writer Tom Reeder described working on the show:
Employing a live audience became impractical as lengthy reshoots became commonplace. By Season 4, only a quiet laugh track was used when necessary.

===Barney Miller&#x27;s wife===
When &quot;Barney Miller&quot; premiered in January 1975, actress Barbara Barrie was hired as a regular cast member to play Liz Miller, Barney&#x27;s wise, faithful, and loving wife. She received second billing in the opening credits after Hal Linden. During that half-season, Barrie appeared in seven episodes out of thirteen. At that time, the premise of the show was to focus on Barney&#x27;s career as a police captain at the 12th Precinct as well as his home life with his wife and children.

At the start of the 1975–76 season, when it became evident that storylines at the 12th Precinct were taking precedence, Barrie went to producer Danny Arnold and asked to be released from the show. Arnold reluctantly agreed and Barrie appeared in only two episodes that year: &quot;The Social Worker&quot;, which was the second episode of the second season, and the holiday installment &quot;Happy New Year&quot;. But she continued to receive second billing in the opening credits throughout the second year.

In the third season, Barrie&#x27;s character as well as Barney&#x27;s children were occasionally mentioned but never seen. In the spring of 1978, Barrie returned to the series as a guest star reprising her role of Liz Miller in the episode &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;. In that episode, Barney gets shot on duty, but survives his attack virtually unharmed. Liz, upset by the incident and unable to withstand the pressures of being a policeman&#x27;s wife, gives Barney an ultimatum to either give up his police job so they can move to a safer neighborhood or end their marriage. At the end of the episode, Barney and Liz separate.

During the 1978–79 season, Barrie made her final appearance on &quot;Barney Miller&quot; in the Christmas show &quot;Toys&quot;. In that episode, Liz meets Barney at the 12th Precinct on Christmas Eve to discuss celebrating the holidays with their children, leading up to the possibility of a reconciliation. After this episode, Liz is never seen again, but toward the end of the fifth season, Barney happily announces to his staff that he and Liz have ended their separation and that he is moving back to their apartment. Despite Barrie&#x27;s absence, her character continues to be mentioned throughout the rest of the show&#x27;s run.

===Fish===
In the first season of &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, the character of Fish (played by Abe Vigoda) proved so popular that ABC was considering a spin-off as early as October 1975, and the actor Vigoda tried to emphasize his importance to &quot;Barney Miller&quot;. Author Richard Meyers reported, &quot;Abe Vigoda had been complaining loudly and often that if it were not for Fish, &quot;Barney&quot; might be a bust. He wanted more attention, more credit, and more money. [&quot;TV Guide&quot;] said that he wanted the show changed to &quot;Fish and Barney&quot;, although he would accept &quot;Barney and Fish&quot;.&quot; Producer Danny Arnold settled the situation by giving Vigoda his own show, provided that he appeared on at least some of the &quot;Barney Miller&quot; episodes in the meantime.

&quot;Fish&quot; premiered on February 5, 1977. It focused on the domestic side of Fish&#x27;s life as he and his wife Bernice (played by Florence Stanley) became foster parents to five racially mixed children known as &quot;Persons in Need of Supervision&quot; (PINS). Fish continued to appear sporadically in the second half of Season 3 of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; while also starring in &quot;Fish&quot;. During the 1977–78 season, Fish officially retired from the NYPD in Season 4, Episode 2 episode of &quot;Barney Miller&quot;. &quot;Fish&quot; had reasonably good ratings but did not match &quot;Barney Miller&quot;. ABC was going to renew the show for a third season, but, according to cast member Todd Bridges, Vigoda demanded more money than the producers were willing to pay. As a result, ABC canceled &quot;Fish&quot; in May 1978 without a series finale. Vigoda did not return to &quot;Barney Miller&quot; as a regular cast member, but in the spring of 1981, he did make a final appearance as Fish as a guest in the seventh-season episode &quot;Lady and the Bomb&quot;, thus giving his character some closure.

===Wojo pilot===
After &quot;Fish&quot; was canceled, a special one-hour episode of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; aired on January 25, 1979. It was created as a pilot episode for another possible &quot;Barney Miller&quot; spin-off to star series regular Max Gail. Titled &quot;Wojo&#x27;s Girl&quot;, the first half of the episode was set at the 12th Precinct in which Wojo (played by Gail) decides to have his girlfriend Nancy, a former prostitute (played by Darlene Parks), live with him. The second half of the installment takes place entirely in Wojo&#x27;s apartment as he and Nancy try and struggle to adjust to living together. The pilot did not sell, Parks&#x27;s character of Nancy was never seen again and Gail remained with &quot;Barney Miller&quot; until the series ended in the spring of 1982.

===Linda Lavin===
Shortly after the premiere of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; in early 1975, actress Linda Lavin guest starred as Detective Janice Wentworth on the eighth episode &quot;Ms. Cop&quot;. Her character in that installment went over very well with audiences and Lavin was brought back as a semi-regular for &quot;Barney Miller&quot; second year. During that season, a romance began at the 12th Precinct between Detective Wentworth and Detective (Wojo) Wojciehowicz (played by Max Gail). However, at the same time, Lavin had just completed a television pilot for CBS called &quot;Alice&quot;, which was based on the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;. The pilot quickly sold to CBS and they included it on their schedule for the 1976–1977 season. As a result, Lavin left &quot;Barney Miller&quot; at the end of the show&#x27;s second season. &quot;Alice&quot; ran for nine years on CBS and immediately established Lavin as a television star. Lavin never returned to &quot;Barney Miller&quot; although her character of Detective Janice Wentworth was briefly seen in a flashback in the last episode of the series &quot;Landmark: Part 3&quot;.

===Death of Jack Soo===
Towards the end of the fourth year, Jack Soo was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and was absent for the last five episodes of the 1977–78 season. To help fill the void during his medical leave, actress Mari Gorman was brought in for three installments as Officer Rosslyn Licori. Cast member Ron Carey&#x27;s role of Officer Carl Levitt was also expanded at this time to compensate for Soo&#x27;s absence. Soo returned to &quot;Barney Miller&quot; at the start of the 1978–79 season but his cancer had already metastasized and spread very quickly. As a result, he was only able to complete nine episodes that year. By the time he taped his last appearance which was the installment &quot;The Vandal&quot; that aired on November 9, 1978, Soo&#x27;s illness was quite evident in his rapid weight loss. Two months later, he died on January 11, 1979, at the age of 61. The fifth-season finale &quot;Jack Soo: A Retrospective&quot; aired on May 17, 1979, and was a tribute to him. For this installment, the cast of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; led by Hal Linden appeared as themselves on the 12th Precinct office set as they fondly shared stories and reminiscences about Soo as an actor and as a friend. At the end of the episode, the cast raised their coffee cups in loving memory of Jack Soo.

===Paul Lieber===
During the seventh season, in an attempt to fill the void left by Jack Soo, a new character was added to &quot;Barney Miller&quot;: Detective Sergeant Eric Dorsey. The role was filled by actor Paul Lieber, who had shown promise during the previous season as an inept gunman in &quot;The Architect&quot;. Sgt. Dorsey antagonized the squad members immediately by assuming they were all corrupt. Even though he eventually realized that his convictions were not true, the character was not popular with viewers. As a result, Lieber&#x27;s tenure on the show lasted only a few weeks with his character of Dorsey reassigned to another precinct.

===LGBT===
Marty Morrison (played by Jack DeLeon) was an effeminate shoplifter always getting caught and always trying to plead for clemency from Capt. Miller. After several solo appearances Marty was joined by his more serious friend Darryl Driscoll (played by Ray Stewart). These were among the earliest recurring gay characters on American television. Danny Arnold worked closely with the Gay Media Task Force, an activist group that worked on LGBT representation in media, in developing the characters. Initially both characters were presented in a stereotypically effeminate manner but in later appearances Darryl began dressing and speaking in a more mainstream fashion. Officer Zitelli&#x27;s coming out was not the first gay storyline on American television, but was a memorable one.

===Slow ratings growth===
The series took a while to become a hit, but ABC supported it anyway.

In the 1975 &quot;The Courtesans&quot; episode (S1 E5) with Nancy Dussault, creator/producer/showrunner Danny Arnold threatened to quit his own show, if network censors removed a risqué punchline. (At the end of the episode, Wojo made an especially cutting remark to the prostitute, who responded in kind and left the station house. Wojo then timidly asked Barney for the loan of fifty dollars.) The network relented and the resulting publicity over the x-rated episode that was banned in two markets ensured the series&#x27; ratings survival, according to Hal Linden.

Danny Arnold ended production of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; in 1982 after eight seasons for fear of repeating storylines; the show was not canceled by the network.

==Reception by police==
&quot;Barney Miller&quot; retains a devoted following among real-life police officers, who appreciate the show&#x27;s emphasis on dialog and believably quirky characters, and its low-key portrayal of cops going about their jobs. In a 2005 op-ed for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, New York police detective Lucas Miller wrote:

Similarly, during his appearance on Jon Favreau&#x27;s Independent Film Channel talk show &quot;Dinner for Five&quot;, Dennis Farina, who worked as a Chicago police officer before turning to acting, called &quot;Barney Miller&quot; the most realistic cop show ever seen on television.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;Barney Miller&quot; won a DGA Award from the Directors Guild of America in 1981. The series won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1982, after it ended. It received six other nominations in that category, from 1976 to 1981. The series won Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series in 1980 (in addition to nominations in 1976, 1977 and 1982), Outstanding Directing in a Comedy or Comedy-Variety or Music Series in 1979, and was nominated for a number of others. It won Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Comedy or Musical Series in 1976 and 1977 (from a total of seven nominations), and won a Peabody Award in 1978. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;Barney Miller&quot; at No. 46 on its list of the 60 best series of all time.

==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released the first three seasons of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Season 1 was released on January 20, 2004, to slow sales, and Sony decided not to release any more seasons. However, the decision was later reversed and Season 2 was released in 2008 (four years after the release of Season 1), followed by Season 3 in 2009.

Shout! Factory acquired the rights to the series in 2011 and subsequently released a complete series set on October 25, 2011. The 25-disc set features all 168 episodes of the series as well as bonus features and the first season of the Abe Vigoda spin-off, &quot;Fish&quot;.

In 2014, Shout! began releasing individual season sets, season 4 was released on January 7, 2014, season 5 on May 13, 2014. Season 6 on December 9, 2014. and Season 7 on April 7, 2015, followed by the eighth and final season on July 7, 2015.

<doc id="543474" wikidata="Q57172" url="?curid=543474" title="Georg von Küchler">
<text>Georg Carl Wilhelm Friedrich von Küchler (30 May 1881 – 25 May 1968) was a German Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during the Second World War, who was subsequently convicted of war crimes. He commanded the 18th Army and Army Group North during the Soviet-German war of 1941–1945.

After the end of the war, he was tried in the High Command Trial, as part of the Subsequent Nuremberg trials. On 27 October 1948 he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Soviet Union. He was released in 1953.

==Early life and World War I==
Born on 30 May 1881 at Schloss Philippsruhe, Küchler&#x27;s family were Prussian Junker. He entered the Imperial Army in 1900 as an officer cadet in the artillery. He was posted to the 25th Field Artillery Regiment and the following year was commissioned as a &quot;Leutnant&quot; (second lieutenant). He remained in his regiment until 1907, when he was assigned to Military Riding School. He received a promotion to &quot;Oberleutnant&quot; (first lieutenant) in 1910 and studied at the Prussian Military Academy for three years. He joined the Greater General Staff in Berlin after his graduation from the academy in 1913.

When World War I commenced, Küchler was sent to the Western Front. Now a &quot;Hauptmann&quot; (captain), he was given command of an artillery battery. He participated in the battles at the Somme and Verdun and later in the Champagne Province. Within months of arriving on the Western Front, he had been awarded both the first and second classes of the Iron Cross.

After serving on the frontlines, Küchler performed staff duties at IV Corps and later VIII Corps. By the end of 1916 he was the &#x27;Staff Officer, Operations&#x27; with the 206th Infantry Division. He returned to Germany later in the war to take a similar post with 8th Reserve Division. By the end of the war he was serving of the staff of Rüdiger von der Goltz, commander of the Baltic Sea Division. After the armistice and still in the Baltics, he joined the Freikorps and fought the Red Army in Poland.

==Interwar period==
After the war, Küchler was retained in the postwar &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. He initially served in the East Prussian military district (Wehrkreis I) before being given command of a battery in the 5th Artillery Regiment. Promoted to major in 1924, he was appointed Commandant of Münster for a time, before serving with the Defence Ministry as inspector of schools. By 1931 he had reached the rank of Oberst (colonel) and the following year was deputy commander of what was to become the 1st Infantry Division. By 1934 he was commander of the division having been promoted to Generalmajor that October. He received a further promotion the next year, to Generalleutnant and a new posting, Inspector of Army Schools.

In 1938 Küchler supported Adolf Hitler in his removal of Werner von Blomberg and Werner von Fritsch from power. At this stage of his career, Küchler was a General of Artillery and commander of the 1st Military District. This was a challenging post as it was cc East Prussia and largely surrounded by Poland. Much of his work was in improving the defences of the area but in March 1939, his troops marched into the Lithuanian city of Memel (now Klaipėda).

==World War II==
===Invasion of Poland===
On the outbreak of World War II, Küchler&#x27;s district headquarters was designated as the Wehrmacht&#x27;s 3rd Army. He now controlled seven infantry divisions, the Panzer Division Kempf plus four commands of brigade size. During the invasion of Poland, some of Küchler&#x27;s troops captured Danzig while the bulk of his forces advanced against the Polish Modlin Army. Having taken some ten thousand prisoners, Panzer Division Kempf was within fifty miles near Warsaw but, along with the rest of the 3rd Army, Kempf was diverted to the east of Poland. Küchler&#x27;s forces defeated the Polish units in the area and then linked up with Soviet troops. At the conclusion of the Polish campaign, Küchler, still based in Poland, was designated commander of Army Frontier Command North.

Küchler refused to use his soldiers to persecute Jewish and Polish civilians, explaining to the Gauleiter of East Prussia Erich Koch that the &quot;German army is not a supplier for a killer gang&quot;. This made Himmler furious and Küchler was removed from command. In November 1939, Commander in Chief of the Army Walther von Brauchitsch appointed Küchler commander of the 18th Army, then being organised in northern Germany. It comprised five infantry divisions, as well as a motorized division and the 9th Panzer Division, and was intended for operations against Holland.

===Invasion of the Netherlands===

On the morning of 10 May 1940, the German armed forces commenced the implementation of the &quot;Fall Gelb&quot; plan for the invasion of the Low Countries and France. The order for the invasion was issued by Army Commander-in-Chief Brauchitsch, without the attack being preceded by a declaration of war. The Luftwaffe started bombing Dutch airfields and other targets, with the city of Rotterdam in particular suffering a devastating assault that ended after four days with the old-city center entirely destroyed. The German ground forces entered the country as soon as the bombardments were concluded, led by paratrooper landings. 

Küchler, fighting under General Fedor von Bock and commanding the 18th Army, defeated the Dutch ground forces at Moerdijk, Rotterdam, and the Hague. After several days of fighting in the country, on May 14, Dutch Army Commander-in-Chief General Henri Gerard Winkelman surrendered the armies north and east of the river Schelde, an area encompassing almost all of the Netherlands. Küchler, as the ranking German officer in the area, met the Dutch military delegation led by Winkelman at the village of Rijsoord and witnessed on behalf of the Wehrmacht the document of Dutch capitulation.

Küchler&#x27;s troops then moved into the Kingdom of Belgium where they occupied Antwerp on 18 May 1940.

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===

In 1940 he was supportive of Nazi racial policy and ordered on 22 February a halt to any criticism of &quot;ethnic struggle being carried out in the General Government, for instance, that of the Polish minorities, of the Jews and those regarding Church matters&quot;. His order explained that the &quot;final ethnic solution&quot; required unique and harsh measures.

Küchler was an active supporter of the planned war of annihilation &quot;(Vernichtungskrieg)&quot; against the Soviet Union. After meeting Hitler in March 1941 to plan for Operation Barbarossa, Küchler told his divisional commanders on 25 April 1941:&quot;We are separated from Russia, ideologically and racially, by a deep abyss. Russia is, if only by the mass of her territory, an Asian state...The &quot;Führer&quot; does not wish to palm off responsibility for Germany&#x27;s existence on to a later generation; he has decided to force the dispute with Russia before the year is out. If Germany wishes to live in peace for generations, safe from a threatening danger in the East, this cannot be a case of pushing Russia back a little-or even hundreds of kilometers-but the aim must be to annihilate European Russia, to dissolve the Russian state in Europe&quot;. Küchler went on to call Red Army commissars &quot;criminals&quot; who should all be shot.

During Operation Barbarossa, the 18th Army forced its way to Ostrov and Pskov after the Soviet troops of the Northwestern Front retreated towards Leningrad. On 10 July 1941, both Ostrov and Pskov were captured and the 18th Army reached Narva and Kingisepp, from where advance toward Leningrad continued from the Luga River line. This had the effect of creating siege positions from the Gulf of Finland to Lake Ladoga, with the eventual aim of isolating Leningrad from all directions.

Küchler was directly involved in the murder of mentally disabled people in the occupied Soviet Union. In December 1941, with his express consent, units of the SD shot 240 mental patients in the Russian town of Makaryevo.

On 17 January 1942, Küchler succeeded Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb as commander of Army Group North after the latter was relieved of command. Küchler commanded Army Group North from December 1941 through January 1944, maintaining the siege of Leningrad. On 30 June 1942 Hitler promoted Küchler to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;.

Brought back to Hitler&#x27;s headquarters on 31 January 1944, Küchler was relieved of his command and replaced by &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Model. Although Model stabilised the situation by March, this was only by withdrawing what was left of 18th Army to the west of Lake Peipus. Küchler in the meantime went into retirement. He declined an invitation from Carl Goerdeler and Johannes Popitz to join the anti-Hitler movement.

==Trial and conviction==
At the end of World War II, Küchler was arrested by American occupation authorities. He was tried in the High Command Trial, as part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials. In his testimony regarding the crimes against the Soviet prisoners of war, Küchler admitted that the conditions in the POW camps were harsh, but insisted that the main cause of that was the winter conditions of 1941–42, which he called an &quot;act of God&quot; and insisted that the army exaggerated POW mortality in their reports in an effort to receive more supplies for the prisoners.

On 27 October 1948 Küchler was sentenced to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Soviet Union. His sentence was reviewed by the &quot;Peck Panel&quot; and reduced to 12 years in 1951. He was released in February 1953 and lived with his wife in the Garmisch region. He died in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on 25 May 1968.

<text>Whirlpool State Park is a state park located in Niagara County, New York, north of the city of Niagara Falls. The park overlooks the Niagara Whirlpool on the Niagara River and the lower Niagara Gorge.

==Description==
Whirlpool State Park is a day-use park offering a playground, picnic tables and pavilions, hiking and biking, a nature trail, fishing, and cross-country skiing. A visitor center is open during the summer months from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday.

A stone staircase within the park descends into the Niagara Gorge; a section of the staircase was reconstructed in 2016. The park is connected with nearby Devil&#x27;s Hole State Park via the Devil&#x27;s Hole Trail at the gorge&#x27;s bottom, as well as a trail along the gorge&#x27;s rim, which together form a complete loop.

<text>The New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry manages a public park system which consists of over 50 protected areas designated as state parks, state forests, recreation areas, and other properties within the state of New Jersey in the United States. The agency also owns and manages 38 historical sites and buildings throughout the state (some located within the boundaries of state parkland) and also owns five public marinas and four public golf courses. These properties are administered by the Division&#x27;s State Park Service, founded in 1923. New Jersey&#x27;s state park system includes properties as small as the Barnegat Lighthouse State Park and as large as the Wharton State Forest. The state park system comprises —roughly 7.7% of New Jersey&#x27;s land area—and serves over 17.8 million annual visitors.

==History of the New Jersey state park system==

===Forests and the Forest Park Reservation Commission===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, New Jersey did not have much of a lumber or forestry industry. The value of its trees was insignificant and undermined by destruction by uncontrolled forest fires, and after decades of clear-cutting forests to fuel iron forges, furnaces, and other industrial operations. In 1896, the state geologist recommended the acquisition of land for parks in order to protect water supplies and to provide natural recreation to the state&#x27;s increasing urban populations. After several years of reports and advocacy of geologists and naturalists (including, notably, U.S. forester Gifford Pinchot), New Jersey governor Edward C. Stokes established the Forest Park Reservation Commission in 1905 to protect forest land and create a system of park reserves within the state. At the commission&#x27;s meeting on September 12, 1905, the commissioners adopted the Salem Oak (of Salem, New Jersey) as a symbol of New Jersey&#x27;s parks. The commissioners acquired two tracts in southern New Jersey, near Mays Landing and along the Bass River, as the first state forest reserves. The Mays Landing tract was sold in 1916 after opposition from local officials and landowners made acquisition and expansion on adjacent lands impossible. The Bass River tract became the core of Bass River State Forest. In 1907, the commissioners would also acquire on Kittatinny Mountain near Culver&#x27;s Gap, supplemented by a gift from Governor Stokes, which would become the core of Stokes State Forest. The reservations, which by 1912 comprised became sites for studying forests, reforestation projects, and scientific forestry. With the acquisition of a tract that included Swartswood Lake in Stillwater Township, the commission began developing parks for the purposes of recreation by providing boating, fishing, camping, and picnicking. In the Commission&#x27;s 1915 Annual Report, they stated &quot;It is intended to make Swartswood a public playground. Boat liveries and picnic shelters to be maintained under proper control will make it available to a large number of people&quot;. The Forest Park Reservation Commission was consolidated with other agencies into the &quot;Department and Board of Conservation and Development&quot; on April 8, 1915.

===State Park Service===

In 1923, the legislature authorized the creation of the State Park Service to administer the state parks and forests. New Jersey began to redirect its efforts from the development of these and other properties for recreational purposes instead of protecting or promoting the commercial potential of forested land. The state legislature established a commission to create a historic park along the Delaware River above Trenton, at the location where George Washington and Continental Army crossed the river on December 25, 1776 before the surprise attack on Hessian troops at the Battle of Trenton and the Battle of Princeton (January 3, 1777). The initial plans were defeated by a public referendum, but there was increased desire to complete these plans to establish a Washington Crossing Memorial Park in time for the 150th anniversary of American independence in 1926. The park was officially dedicated and opened to the public on June 4, 1927. In the wake of World War I, state forester Alfred Gaskill proposed a new public park along Kittatinny Mountain, &quot;as the State’s memorial to its sons who had made the supreme sacrifice in the Great War&quot;. A few years later, Colonel Anthony R. Kuser donated his mountaintop estate at High Point (the state&#x27;s highest elevation) to the state for a public park with an additional gift of $500,000 to erect a granite-clad obelisk to honor veterans. Construction of the monument began in 1928 and was completed in 1930.

According to the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry administers and manages in its state parks, forests, and other areas. These areas, during the state&#x27;s 2006 fiscal year (from July 1, 2005 to June 30, 2006) recorded 17,843,541 visitors.

===Planning future parks===
In 2006, the Division of Parks and Forestry began planning and preliminary work two new state parks: Great Falls State Park in Paterson, and Capital State Park in Trenton. The state&#x27;s only other urban park is Liberty State Park in Jersey City. According to the master plan prepared by Philadelphia-based planning and urban design firm Wallace Roberts &amp; Todd, Capital State Park would incorporate areas around the state&#x27;s capitol complex in Trenton and the city&#x27;s Delaware River and Assunpink Creek waterfronts to provide &quot;a long-term strategy to revitalize Trenton by reestablishing connections to the downtown and reclaiming its riverfront.&quot; Great Falls subsequently became Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park.

In 2009, the state also purchased in Jefferson Township the former site of the Mount Paul monastery and seminary belonging to Paulist Fathers (from 1924–2009). The tract, which will be developed into a state park, is located in the state&#x27;s Highlands region on the eastern side of Sparta Mountain and featuring mountain streams that flow into the Russia Brook (a tributary of the Rockaway River).

In 2021, Governor Phil Murphy approved the state purchase of part of an abandoned right-of way from Norfolk Southern Railway for the purpose of converting it into a new state park tentatively named the Essex - Hudson Greenway . The park will run from Montclair to Jersey City. Largely facilitated by the Open Space Institute, the park will also be a crucial section of the East Coast Greenway as well as part the 9/11 Memorial Trail, which will connect Shanksville, The Pentagon, and One World Trade Center. It will connect to the proposed Hackensack River Greenway and possibly the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway. The park may also incorporate a &quot;transitway, a project proposed in NJ Transit&#x27;s &quot;Innovation Challenge&quot;, which aims to add a new, creative transportation solutions to The Meadowlands

==Recreation and facilities==

The State Park Service asks its visitors to embrace the &quot;Carry In, Carry Out&quot; philosophy in order to &quot;keep the parks clean and beautiful by carrying out the trash you carry in&quot;.

Fishing and hunting are permitted in several of the state parks and forest.

===Golf courses===
The State Park System also includes four golf courses that are open to the public. Each of the four courses include associated restaurant and banquet facilities and is operated under contract between a private management company and the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry. Centerton Golf Course, located in Pittsgrove Township in Salem County is located within Parvin State Park. Cream Ridge Golf Course is located in Cream Ridge in Monmouth County and was acquired by the state in 2006. Spring Meadow Golf Course in Farmingdale in Monmouth County was privately developed and operated beginning in the 1920s and acquired by the state five decades later.

<doc id="543480" wikidata="Q5454476" url="?curid=543480" title="Fish (American TV series)">
<text>Fish is an American sitcom and a spin-off of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; that aired on ABC from February 5, 1977 to May 18, 1978. The series starred Abe Vigoda as New York City Police Department Detective Phil Fish and Florence Stanley as his wife Bernice.

== Overview ==

The series focused on the domestic side of Fish&#x27;s life: he and Bernice became foster parents to a racially-mixed group of five children known as &quot;Persons in Need of Supervision&quot; or PINS. The kids were played by Todd Bridges, Denise Miller, Len Bari, John Cassisi, and Sarah Natoli. Barry Gordon played Charlie, a graduate student majoring in child psychology, assisting Fish and Bernice in supervising the kids. Miller and Cassisi both had appeared previously as the same characters on season three of &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, usually getting in trouble with the law and Fish having to supervise them. Bridges had appeared as a different character during the first season of &quot;Barney Miller&quot;.

During the show&#x27;s first season, frequent references were made to Fish&#x27;s job as a detective and his colleagues at the 12th Precinct. Two characters from &quot;Barney Miller&quot; made crossover appearances on &quot;Fish&quot;: Steve Landesberg as Det. Arthur Dietrich in episode 8, and (in a brief, uncredited and wordless cameo in episode 10) Hal Linden as Capt. Barney Miller. 

Vigoda&#x27;s character of Phil Fish continued to appear sporadically in the second half of Season 3 of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; while also leading the cast of &quot;Fish&quot;. Detective Fish retired from the NYPD in Season 4, Episode 2 of &quot;Barney Miller&quot;.

==Cast==

*Abe Vigoda as Philip K. Fish
*Florence Stanley as Bernice Fish
*Barry Gordon as Charlie Harrison
*John Cassisi as Victor Kruetzer
*Denise Miller as Jilly Papalardo
*Lenny Bari as Mike Ferroni
*Todd Bridges as Loomis
*Sarah Natoli as Diane Polanski

== Development and production ==
Creator Danny Arnold was originally against the idea of giving the character of Fish his own spin-off, believing that Fish was a character that was better suited to the precinct. Originally, Arnold agreed to the spin-off on the condition that Vigoda continued to play his Fish character on the show in half of the episodes of the third season, as well as future seasons. However, Vigoda insisted on quitting &quot;Barney Miller&quot; and staying on just &quot;Fish&quot;, wanting to be the star of his own series. &quot;I found myself with a very unhappy actor on my hands. Abe would walk around the set like a man in shock. Who was I to deprive an actor of this once-in-a-lifetime break? Finally I said, &#x27;Okay, just stay through the third year of &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, and we&#x27;ll go with your show, too,&quot; recalled Arnold. 

ABC was publicly contemplating a &quot;Fish&quot; spin-off as early as October 1975. The initial premise was to show Fish&#x27;s home life with &quot;his wife, his daughter, and his daughter&#x27;s suitor&quot; with only occasional visits to the 12th Precinct. The intention was to have a pilot air as an episode of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; in early 1976 with a series debut that fall. The second-season episode of &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, &quot;Fish&quot;, effectively was the pilot for that concept, with much of the episode taking place in Fish&#x27;s home and featuring Fish&#x27;s wife and daughter, along with the daughter&#x27;s romantic drama.

&quot;Fish&quot; was directed by Jeremiah Morris and aired from February 1977 through June 1978 on ABC. According to Bridges, just 12 during the show&#x27;s second season, &quot;Fish&quot; was cancelled after Vigoda demanded more money for a third season than the producers were willing to pay.

The series had no episode written as a finale. However, during a guest appearance on &quot;Barney Miller&quot; nearly three years after the cancellation of &quot;Fish&quot;, the Fish character stated that money for the group home had been cut off, so the city took back the kids. Fish also stated, resignedly, that Cassisi&#x27;s character (Victor) had gotten arrested for assault and battery, and Miller&#x27;s character (Jilly) had gotten pregnant and married the baby&#x27;s father.

== Home media ==
Shout! Factory released the entire &quot;Barney Miller&quot; series in a 25-disc DVD set on October 25, 2011. A bonus feature of the set is the complete first season of &quot;Fish&quot;, making it the first time that &quot;Fish&quot; has ever seen a DVD release.

<doc id="543486" wikidata="Q4874336" url="?curid=543486" title="Bayard Cutting Arboretum State Park">
<text>Bayard Cutting Arboretum State Park is a state park located in the hamlet of Great River, New York, on Long Island. The park includes an arboretum designed by Frederick Law Olmsted for William Bayard Cutting in 1886, as well as a mansion designed by Charles C. Haight. Today Bayard Cutting Arboretum State Park is one of the last remaining estates on the South Shore of Long Island. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1973 as a historic district. Robert Fulton Cutting, known as the “first citizen of New York” and his wife Helen Suydam Cutting, niece to Caroline Astor, would frequent the manor house and estate as both William and Robert were brothers. Together Robert and William brought the sugar beet industry to the United States.

==History==
William &quot;Bayard&quot; Cutting, a prominent New York City lawyer and financier along with his younger brother Robert (previously mentioned) purchased over 900 acres in the village of Oakdale from George Lorillard in 1881. The two Cutting brothers split the property originally known as Westbrook Farm with Robert Fulton Cutting retaining Lorillard&#x27;s house and William Bayard Cutting building another. Both brothers were the grandsons of Robert Cutting, who had been Robert Fulton&#x27;s partner in the ferry from Brooklyn to New York. They were also both direct descendants of the prominent William Bayard Jr. a close friend to Alexander Hamilton.

In 1895, Bayard and his brother installed a golf course at Westbrook, which was the first private golf course in the United States. The course was designed by Willie Dunn who had also created the Shinnecock Hills golf course in Southampton. It was a nine-hole course and for many years hosted the Westbrook Cup tournament.

Other changes to the estate took place when a fire in 1895 burned down many of the farm buildings. Stanford White was commissioned to draw the plans for a modern dairy, Westbrook Farms, with many innovative features.

In 1899, a hunting lodge, made only of cedar logs, was built on the property. There was an earthen floor and a stone fireplace complete with irons and spits. Wooden pegs were used as hangers. The cabin was modeled after those used by pioneers.

Bayard Cutting died on March 1, 1912, due to complications from heart disease. He was 62 years old and buried in the family vault at Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn. After his death, his widow, Mrs. Olivia Cutting, inherited over $9 million from his estate when it was probated in 1913.

==Mansion==

Boasting 19,000 square feet, the “summer home” of William and his wife at the heart of the park, Westbrook, is modeled on a Tudor-style English country house. The interior of the 60-room mansion features large pieces of oak furniture, stained-glass windows from Louis Comfort Tiffany, and imported fireplaces. Views of the Connetquot River can be seen from across the open lawn.

Most recently, one of the family bedroom’s was a filming location for HBO Max’s The Gilded Age. The Martin Scorsese’s period drama “The Age of Innocence” was also filmed partially on the vast estate.

There is also a designated shower that was built specifically for the Cutting’s friend Nobel Prize Winner Dr. Albert Schweitzer who was not a fan of baths.

==Landscape==
Bayard began developing the grounds of his home in 1887 with the assistance of Frederick Law Olmsted with a focus on the landscape&#x27;s natural beauty.Charles Sprague Sargent, director of the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, advised Cutting in developing the extensive conifer collection north of the carriage house. Cutting also was in touch with Ernest Wilson, who was sponsored by Harvard University to bring back tree specimens from China.

The original rhododendrons and first tree specimens at the arboretum came from nurseries in England in the early 1900s. Other trees in the park included: firs, spruces, pines, hemlock, cedar and yews originating from Europe, Spain, Greece, Japan, China and Africa.

==Park==
On June 18, 1936, the Long Island State Park Commission was given 200 acres of the Cutting estate for use as an arboretum by Mrs. Bayard James, daughter of William Cutting, with the stipulation that she and her mother keep full use of the property as long as either is living. Both the house and property were given to the people of Long Island &quot;to provide an oasis of beauty and quiet for the pleasure, rest, and refreshment of those who delight in outdoor beauty; and to bring about a greater appreciation and understanding of the value and importance of informal planting&quot;.
The Long Island State Park Commission took over control of the park on Dec. 1, 1952. An endowment fund of $1,000,000 had been set up by Mrs. Cutting who died November 15, 1949 Alterations were made to the property including the addition of bathrooms and parking lots and adding a tearoom to the main house. Improvements were also made to roads and paths.

The park officially opened to the public on May 15, 1954. In keeping with the purpose of the gift, the commission decided that there would be no picnicking, bathing, horseback riding or playgrounds allowed on the property. More parking spaces were added the following year to accommodate more visitors. Extensions were also made to trails and walks

Today, the park has a variety of nature trails including: the Woodland Garden Walk, the Perennial Garden Walk, the River Walk, the New Pinetum Walk, the Old Pinetum Walk, the Holly Walk, the Paradise Island Walk and the Royce Rhododendron Walk. There are recreational programs and a food and a gift shop at Westbrook.

The Bayard Cutting Arboretum Horticultural Society, founded in 1974, donates profits of its activities to help support the Westbrook Manor. As part of its fundraising activities, the organization operates Granny&#x27;s Attic located in the lower carriage house and hosts two plant sales a year. Recent Westbrook Manor projects funded in part by the Horticultural Society include: porch restoration, porch pillars restoration, new carpeting, Tiffany windows restoration and floor sanding.

Two hurricanes affected the state park. In 1954, Hurricane Carol destroyed over 70 trees but much more damage was done when over 1,000 of some of the most mature trees were lost in Hurricane Gloria in 1985.

The Bayard Cutting Arboretum farm was established in 2012. It was the first Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program in the New York State park system. The farm produces over 150 varieties of vegetables and berries and also grows culinary herbs and flowers. There are 150 hens providing eggs to members of the CSA program.

Two gardens have been restored by the noted public park designer Lynden B. Miller.
The park winter hours (November–March) are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Summer hours (April–October) are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. In 2023, construction began on a new, glass-walled visitor center containing exhibition space.

<doc id="543489" wikidata="Q1186024" url="?curid=543489" title="Jimmy Collins">
<text>James Joseph Collins (January 16, 1870 – March 6, 1943) was an American professional baseball player. He played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball. In 1945, Collins was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. He played for the Boston Beaneaters, Louisville Colonels, Boston Americans, and Philadelphia Athletics. He also managed the Americans.

Collins was especially regarded for his defense. He was best known for his ability to field a bunt—prior to his debut, it was the shortstop who fielded bunts down the third base line—and is regarded as a pioneer of the modern defensive play of a third baseman. As of 2012, he is second all-time in putouts by a third baseman behind Brooks Robinson. At the plate, Collins finished his career with 65 home runs, 1055 runs scored, 983 RBI and a .294 batting average.

Collins was also the first manager of the Boston Red Sox franchise, then known as the Boston Americans. He was the winning manager in the first World Series, as Boston defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1903 World Series, five games to three.

==Early life==
Jimmy Collins was born in Niagara Falls, New York. After graduating from St. Joseph&#x27;s Collegiate Institute, he went to work for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and played baseball in the Buffalo City League.

==Playing career==

===Minor leagues===
Collins began his professional baseball career with the minor league Buffalo Bisons of the Eastern League, the forerunner of the current International League, in 1893. That season, he was used primarily as a shortstop, batting .286 in 76 games.

In 1894, Collins was moved to the outfield by the Bisons. He batted .352 with nine home runs in 125 games, and after the season his contract was purchased by the Boston Beaneaters for $500.

===Major league debut===
Collins began his major league career as a right fielder, playing ten games at the position with the Beaneaters in 1895. On May 19, 1895, he was loaned to the Louisville Colonels, again for $500. He was soon made the team&#x27;s starting third baseman, batting .279 over the remainder of the season. His larger impact was on defense, where he played in on the grass rather than back to cut down on the number of bunt hits.

===National League star===
Collins was returned to the Beaneaters after the 1895 season. Joe Harrington was the club&#x27;s starting third baseman at the beginning of the season, but Collins soon asserted himself as the starter, and Harrington was released in July.
Collins asserted himself as a skilled player in 1897 when he held a .346 batting average and knocked in 132 runs. He led the league in both putouts and assists as well, a feat he would duplicate in 1900. He followed with an equally impressive 1898 season, in which he hit .328—seventh in the league—drove in 111 runs and belted a league-high 15 home runs.

===Jumping to the American League===
Following the 1900 season, Collins, who was by now regarded as the best third baseman in the game, was offered the manager&#x27;s job with the Boston Americans of the new American League. He accepted the job, which came with a salary of $5,500, a $3,500 signing bonus, and a cut of the team&#x27;s profits, despite efforts by Beaneaters owner Arthur Soden to keep him. The two traded accusations in the press, and Collins went further, accusing National League owners of conspiring to hold down salaries, stating &quot;I would not go back now if they offered me the whole outfit.&quot; Collins recruited other National League stars for the Americans&#x27; roster, including Cy Young, and in his first season as player-manager guided the team to a second-place finish, four games behind the Chicago White Sox.

===First World Series===
In 1902, Collins was limited to 108 games by injury, and the Americans finished third. He did hit the team&#x27;s first ever inside-the-park grand slam home run. The next season, Collins led the Americans to their first American League pennant, winning the league by games over the Philadelphia Athletics.

With an agreement in place for the champions of the American and National Leagues to meet in a best-of-nine &quot;World Series&quot;, Boston represented the Junior Circuit. After losing two out of three at home to start the series, then losing the first game in Pittsburgh, the Americans won the next three in Pittsburgh, then returned home to win Game Eight in Boston to become the first-ever World Series Champions. Collins himself batted .250 in the Series, with a pair of triples and five runs scored.

===Remaining career===
The Americans won the pennant again in 1904, with Collins batting .271 and leading the league in putouts for the fifth time in eight seasons. However, the Americans would not get the opportunity to defend their title, as John McGraw and the New York Giants refused to play them in the postseason.

In 1905, the Americans slipped to fourth place, and Collins clashed with team president John I. Taylor, reportedly quitting on the team during the season. As a player, Collins batted .276, but again missed time due to injury. In 1906, Collins found himself in hot water, as not only were the Americans in last, but he himself was suspended twice, and was eventually replaced as manager by Chick Stahl. He also missed the end of the season with a knee injury.

Collins began the 1907 season with Boston, but it was only a matter of time before he departed. For reasons that have never become clear, Stahl had committed suicide during spring training; instead of Collins, the Americans turned to Cy Young as manager, following by George Huff, and then Bob Unglaub, all within the first three months of the season. After playing 41 games with the Americans, Collins was traded to the Philadelphia Athletics in June for infielder John Knight. While he batted .278, he had a career-low (to that point) .330 slugging percentage, and failed to hit a home run for the first time in his career. In 1908, he slumped even further, batting just .217, and was let go.

After his major league career ended, Collins continued to play and manage in the minor leagues. He spent 1909 with the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association, then spent two seasons with the Providence Grays in the Eastern League before retiring.

==Honors==

When Collins was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1945, he was the first to be chosen primarily as a third baseman. In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. Collins became a charter member of the Buffalo Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985.

==Managerial record==

* Remained as a player only

==Personal life==
Jimmy Collins married Sarah Murphy in 1907, and the couple had two daughters. After his retirement from baseball, they moved back to Buffalo, where Collins worked for the Buffalo Parks Department. Collins died of pneumonia on March 6, 1943, at the age of 73.

==In popular culture==
Boston-based Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys recorded the song &quot;Jimmy Collins&#x27; Wake&quot; on their 2013 album &quot;Signed and Sealed in Blood&quot;. The song, originally written by Richard Johnson, recounts Collins&#x27; wake in Buffalo, New York, at what is currently K.O. Bar and Grill on Delaware Ave.

<doc id="543493" wikidata="Q2488193" url="?curid=543493" title="Beaver Island State Park">
<text>Beaver Island State Park is a New York state park located on Grand Island in northwestern Erie County, New York in the United States. It is situated at the southern end of the island on the bank of the Niagara River and served by the Beaver Island Parkway, a highway linking the park to Interstate 190 (I-190).

Included within the park is the Beaver Island State Park Golf Course, a USGA-recognized championship 18-hole, par-72 public golf course.

The park is 1 of 80 New York State Parks that are in the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse, with 3 minutes and 43 seconds of totality.

==History==

The present-day Beaver Island State Park opened in 1935 and consists of several historic Grand Island estates of Buffalo&#x27;s elite that were donated to New York State for all Western New Yorkers to enjoy. These grand estates included:
*The Falconwood Club - resort started by Lewis Allen and later owned by George E. Matthews
*River Lawn - summer home and estate of Elbridge G. Spaulding, Franklin Sidway, and later Frank St. John Sidway
*River Lea - summer home of Lewis F. Allen, the uncle of US President Grover Cleveland, is located within the park.
In 2015, it was announced that a new $2 million pro shop with a bar and restaurant and a large, outdoor seating area was coming to Beaver Island Golf Course. It will replace the one destroyed by fire in 2012.

==Recreation==
The park offers a beach, picnic tables with pavilions, recreation programs, a nature trail, birdwatching (including swans, and herons), seasonal waterfowl hunting, fishing and ice-fishing, sledding, cross-country skiing, cross country running, snowshoeing, sledding and snowmobiling, a boat launch with marina and dockage, and a food concession. The park&#x27;s nature center is open from noon to 4 p.m. on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Attendance at Beaver Island rose to about 279,000 in 2014, up from 269,000 in 2013.

Beaver Island State Park is home to the Blue Heron Disc golf course, an 18-hole, disc course completed in 1999.

===Golf course===
The Beaver Island State Park Golf Course is a par 72, yard USGA-recognized championship course with a slope of 108 and a rating of 70.2. Additionally the forward course is a par 74, yard course with a slope of 110 and a rating of 70.1. The latter course is open from April 20 through November 8, weather permitting.

The course was designed by William Harries and Russ Tryon and opened in 1963.

==Beaver Island Parkway==

The Beaver Island Parkway, also known as South Parkway, is a parkway connecting its namesake park to I-190 (the Niagara Section of the New York State Thruway) and New York State Route 324 (NY 324) near the South Grand Island Bridge. This roadway is a four-lane divided expressway, and there are no driveways leading to and from the roadway. However, there are at-grade intersections along the route. The parkway is within the jurisdiction of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation but is maintained and inventoried by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as NY 957B, an unsigned reference route.

All junctions on the route, excluding those with West River Parkway and I-190, are at-grade intersections. At the northern end of the parkway near East River Road, an additional ramp connects to I-190 northbound via NY 324 westbound and Staley Road.

;Route description
Beaver Island Parkway begins at a traffic circle with West River Parkway and Park Road at the entrance to Beaver Island State Park. It heads north as a four-lane divided highway, initially passing through wooded areas on the northern edge of the park. As it leaves the vicinity of the park, the woods around the highway gradually give way to residential neighborhoods. The parkway intersects a few local roads as it turns northeast and comes to its terminus at an interchange with I-190 and NY 324.

<text>Buckhorn Island State Park is an state park located in Erie County, New York in the Town of Grand Island. The park is on the northern end of the island of Grand Island.

The park is 1 of 80 New York State Parks that are in the path of totality for the 2024 solar eclipse, with 3 minutes and 37 seconds of totality.

==Park description==
Buckhorn Island State Park is primarily an exhibit of Niagara River wetlands, and is managed as a preserve. As such, the park offers space for largely passive recreational uses, such as biking, cross-country skiing, fishing, hiking, and a nature trail.

A portion of the park has been set aside as a bird conservation area in order to protect nesting habitat for several species listed as threatened in New York State, including the least bittern, northern harrier, common tern, and sedge wren. The protected habitat also serves as a feeding and breeding area for numerous other species of waterfowl. The park&#x27;s wetlands serve as an overwintering location for 19 species of gulls, nearly half of the world&#x27;s 45 species.

<text>Fort Niagara State Park is located in the Town of Porter in Niagara County, New York, United States. Historic Fort Niagara is located within the park. The park is northwest of Youngstown near the northern terminus of the Niagara Scenic Parkway and is in the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area.

==History==
A brief history of the area now known as Fort Niagara State Park.
*1678: Fort Conti is built by French explorers (which burned to the ground less than a year later)
*1687: Fort Denonville on the former site of Fort Conti
*1726: The French built the two-story “Maison a Machicoulis” (referred to today as the “French Castle”). 
*1893: A US Coast Guard Station was established on the bank of the Niagara below the Fort which is still in service today
*1938: The Officer’s Club building opens, replacing the original structure that was destroyed by fire. The design is inspired by the French Castle in the Old Fort
*1940–1943: The 28th Infantry Regiment was moved south to train and Fort Niagara then served as a reception center for new recruits
*1941: The Fort was granted from the State of New York to the United States.
*1944–1946: Fort Niagara served as a camp for German prisoners of war
*1948: Land transferred to the jurisdiction of the New York State Council of Parks to be managed as a state park.
*1965–1966: The garrison buildings were demolished; of the 100 buildings on the base, most were demolished.

==Amenities==
The park offers picnic tables and pavilions, hiking, a playground and 18 soccer fields, a pool, recreation programs, a nature trail, tennis, sledding, snowshoe trails, cross-country skiing, waterfowl hunting in season, fishing and a food concession. There are two boat launches on the lower Niagara River. The park includes the Old Fort Niagara Historic Site. Tom Loftin Johnson painted five murals at &quot;The Officer&#x27;s Club&quot; which commemorate the history of the 28th regiment from its founding in 1905.

During the summer, a state park naturalist provides nature programs, trail hikes and manages the natural history exhibits in the park&#x27;s nature center.

The skyline of Toronto, to the north, is visible across Lake Ontario from the park on days with clear weather. The tops of the CN Tower and other skyscrapers can be seen, though the Canadian shore itself is hidden below the horizon.

==1872 lighthouse==
The current lighthouse in Fort Niagara State Park, constructed in 1872, is the third to be built at Fort Niagara. It was constructed by the United States government after the previous wooden one was damaged by a tornado. It is an octagonal limestone tower featuring a storage room at the base, that used to hold oil. The Fresnel lens from the old tower was used and the tower was lit for the first time on June 10, 1872.

In 1900 the tower was raised an additional when a watch room was added between the lamp and the limestone tower. Lifting the lamp extended the reach of the light to . Adjacent to the lighthouse is the keeper&#x27;s quarters which is a colonial-style home that now serves as a private residence.

The U.S. Coast Guard ran the light until 1993, when nearby tree overgrowth began to inhibit the light&#x27;s visibility from the Niagara River and Lake Ontario. A modern steel beacon tower was erected near the Coast Guard station and the Old Fort Niagara Association runs the 1872 tower as a museum and gift shop. The original Fresnel lens is now on display in the Fort&#x27;s museum.

==Recent events==
In 2015, as part of Governor Cuomo and New York State&#x27;s plan to invest $72 million in their state parks, $2,500,000 was pledged to modernize the bathhouses at Fort Niagara&#x27;s swimming areas. Additionally, Fort Niagara will share $600,000 across Artpark, Four Mile Creek State Park, Golden Hill State Park and Wilson-Tuscarora State Park for fishing docks and related fishing access projects.

<doc id="543502" wikidata="Q1029431" url="?curid=543502" title="Brigham Young University–Idaho">
<text>Brigham Young University–Idaho (BYU–Idaho or BYUI) is a private college in Rexburg, Idaho. Founded in 1888, the college is owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Previously known as Ricks College, it transitioned from a junior college to a baccalaureate institution in 2001. 

The college&#x27;s focus is on undergraduate education. When it transitioned to a baccalaureate institution in 2001, BYU-Idaho offered about 50 bachelor&#x27;s degrees and 19 associate degrees. As of 2024, the institution offers 102 bachelor&#x27;s degrees (5 of which are online), 22 associate degrees, and 6 other online degrees. It operates on a three-semester system known as &quot;tracks.&quot; The college is broadly organized into 35 departments within six colleges.

Its parent organization, the Church Educational System (CES), sponsors three sister schools—Brigham Young University, Brigham Young University–Hawaii, and Ensign College—as well as the educational organizations Seminaries and Institutes of Religion and BYU-Pathway Worldwide. Clark Gilbert, the CES commissioner, said that each CES higher educational organization has a distinctive role and strategy, with BYU-Idaho being &quot;the teacher&quot;.

The vast majority of students are Latter-day Saints. All students attending BYU–Idaho agree to follow an honor code that mandates behavior in line with the church&#x27;s teachings. A significant percentage of students take an 18-month (women) or 24-month (men) hiatus from their studies to serve as missionaries. Tuition rates are generally lower than those at similar universities, due largely to funding provided by the church from tithing donations, various scholarships, financial aid, and on-campus student jobs.

==History==

===Bannock and Fremont stake academies===
On November 12, 1888, the LDS Church created the Bannock Stake Academy in Rexburg. The precursor to BYU–Idaho, like several other colleges and universities across the mountain west, was established as a &quot;stake academy&quot; first, as Mormon settlers colonized the eastern Snake River Plain in the 1880s. As a stake academy, its purpose was that of a modern secondary school as public schools had not yet been established. As the population grew, it became necessary to divide the geographical area designated by the Church as the Bannock Stake. The Fremont Stake was created, and thus in 1898 the school was renamed the Fremont Stake Academy.

===Ricks College===
In 1903, the school was renamed again as Ricks Academy in honor of Thomas Ricks, the president of the LDS Church&#x27;s Bannock Stake at the time it was founded and the chairman of the school&#x27;s first Board of Education. By the early twentieth century, stake academies had largely been discontinued as public schools became more established in the western United States. Ricks Academy survived as it had added a year of college work to its curriculum and in 1917 was granted state certification, which allowed graduates to teach in the state of Idaho. At that point, it was known as Ricks Normal College with George S. Romney as its first president. In 1923, it was renamed Ricks College and functioned as a two-year junior college. It would serve as a junior college for most of the remainder of the twentieth century, except for a brief period from 1948 to 1956 when it operated as a four-year institution.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the LDS Church began to close, or hand over, its academies to state governments because of better established public education and economic strains on the church. Ricks College was offered as a gift from the church to the state of Idaho at the 1931 legislative session, but was rejected. Bills handing over Ricks College to the state of Idaho were presented at three more legislative sessions, (1933, 1935, 1937), but all were rejected. After almost a decade of facing closure, the church decided to keep Ricks College open. The college emerged with the support of local patrons and accreditation by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges in 1936.

The 1950s brought renewed consideration of closing the college and possibly moving it. However, church president David O. McKay decided against this course of action after a visit to the campus. During the 1976 Teton Dam flood, Ricks College was used as a center for disaster relief operations. By the late twentieth century, the college had become the largest private junior college in the country with over 7,500 students.

===BYU–Idaho===
On June 21, 2000, the LDS Church announced that Ricks College would become a four-year institution known as Brigham Young University–Idaho. This change became official just over a year later on August 10, 2001. Among the associated changes were the elimination of the intercollegiate athletic program and the institution of a larger activities and intramural athletics program. The college also established a &quot;three-track&quot; system which admits students on a specific track of two semesters (including the Spring semester) rather than the standard fall and winter semesters. Among other changes to campus facilities to accommodate the associated growth, the Hyrum Manwaring Student Center was renovated and enlarged and a new auditorium building, the BYU–Idaho Center, with seating for 15,000, was built. The buildings were dedicated in December 2010.

==Campus==

The campus sits on a hill overlooking the city of Rexburg and the Snake River Valley and includes nearly forty major buildings and residence halls on over . Off-campus facilities include a Livestock Center and the Henry&#x27;s Fork Outdoor Learning Center near Rexburg. The Teton Lodge and Quickwater Lodge near Victor, Idaho, are utilized as student leadership and service centers.

The main campus includes a planetarium, an arboretum, and geology and wildlife museums. The college also operates several athletic fields and facilities around campus which are used to support intramural programs and the expanded student activities program that was instituted when intercollegiate sports were discontinued in 2001. Facilities include a football and track stadium, tennis courts, general use fields and the John Hart Physical Education building, which seats 4,000 in its main gym and is used for athletic events and concerts. The building also includes a large fitness center, a pool, auxiliary gymnasiums, racquetball courts and equipment room, all of which are open to students, faculty and staff. On December 17, 2010, the BYU–Idaho Center was dedicated and opened to students. The building contains a 15,000-seat auditorium used for the weekly campus devotional, graduation ceremonies and concerts. The building also features a multi-purpose area with 10 basketball courts and can be subdivided by drop dividers as needed. The David O. McKay Library holds a collection of over 300,000 volumes with about 142,000 transactions processed by the library&#x27;s circulation services annually.

In support of the fine arts and entertainment, the campus also includes the Ruth H. Barrus Concert Hall which houses the acclaimed Ruffatti organ, the third largest organ owned by the Church after those housed in the Salt Lake Tabernacle and Conference Center, respectively. KBYI-FM, a 100,000 watt public radio station, also broadcasts to eastern Idaho and parts of Wyoming and Montana from the campus.

==Organization==

BYU-Idaho is led by Alvin &quot;Trip&quot; F. Meredith, a church general authority, who began serving as president in August 2023. Along with other members of CES, BYU–Idaho is under the direction of a board of trustees, which includes the First Presidency, members of the Quorum of the Twelve, other general authorities, and presidents of church organizations. BYU–Idaho is organized into six colleges:
==Academics==

BYU–Idaho offers several associate-degree programs in addition to its bachelor-degree programs. Across the six colleges, there are thirty-three departments, offering over eighty-seven bachelor-level programs and twenty associate-degree programs. BYU–Idaho&#x27;s engineering programs rank in the top 75 nationally.

The academic year is divided into three equal semesters (fall, winter, spring) of fourteen weeks and is known as the &quot;three-track&quot; system. It was instituted in 2001 as part of the transition from Ricks College to BYU-Idaho and the school&#x27;s &quot;Rethinking Education&quot; campaign. When a student is admitted to BYU–Idaho, they are also assigned to a specific two-semester &quot;track,&quot; (fall-winter, winter-spring, or spring-fall) based partly on preference, degree program, and availability to balance. Initially, the fall and winter semesters were slightly longer (and thus more heavily attended) than the summer semester and had more class options. Beginning in January 2007, the school adjusted the academic calendar equalizing the amount of time available in each semester, lengthening the class periods, and opening class offerings in the spring to allow more students to attend in the spring semester. There is also a short, seven week summer session with accelerated class schedules. BYU-Idaho also offers &quot;fast grad&quot; which allows students to attend all semesters and finish their degree sooner. This is usually available as an option to students who have an upper sophomore or higher standing.

As of the Winter 2024 semester, at BYU-Idaho, there were 17,578 on-campus students, 4,673 campus students taking online classes or participating in internships off campus, and 19,312 online students served in partnership with BYU–Pathway Worldwide for a total of 41,563 students. Students come from all 50 states and more than 130 countries. According to fall 2016 enrollment numbers, 27% of BYU-Idaho campus students came from the state of Idaho, with the majority of students coming from five states: Idaho 27%, California 14%, Utah 10%, Washington 8%, and Arizona 4.5%. Thus, the student body at BYU–Idaho is notably homogeneous—not only due to its geographic representation but also due to ethnicity and religion. During the Fall 2016 semester, 83% of the students were white. Moreover, during the Fall 2016 semester, 99.7% of the students were members of the LDS Church.

==Athletics==
===Ricks Vikings===
Known as the Vikings, Ricks College fielded an intercollegiate athletics program from 1919 to 2002 in the National Junior College Athletic Association, earning 17 national championships, 61 individual national titles, and producing nearly 100 first-team All-Americans. National title wins included Women&#x27;s Cross Country (1988, 1989, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001), Men&#x27;s Cross Country (1965, 1966, 1986, 1999, 2000, 2001), Women&#x27;s Track and Field (1997), and Women&#x27;s Volleyball (1974; AIAW). More than 25 alumni who played football for Ricks went on to play professionally in the National Football League or Canadian Football League.

It was announced in June 2000 that the athletics program would be phased out as part of the change from a junior college to a four-year college, due mainly to the costs associated with running a college athletic department, and the desire to develop a more comprehensive participatory student activities program.

===Athletics as a four-year college===
Since becoming a four-year institution, BYU-Idaho no longer hosts intercollegiate athletic teams but instead developed a competitive (or, as the school uses, &quot;intracollegiate&quot;) athletics program which functions as part of Student Activities. Several teams from within the school compete against one another in a variety of sports throughout the year, complete with regular seasons and playoffs.

==Student life==

=== Latter-day Saint atmosphere ===

The atmosphere at BYU–Idaho is different from most other universities due to its affiliation with the LDS Church. For example, almost every Tuesday that school is in session, a devotional is held on campus. During the devotional, no classes are held, administrative offices close, and students and faculty are encouraged to attend the hour-long worship service either in person (in the BYU–Idaho Center), via campus TV, or on the radio at KBYI 94.3 FM. Speakers are selected from the campus and local communities, as well as from church general authorities who share a spiritually uplifting message. The school&#x27;s honor code also requires students to regularly attend church services, which are held every Sunday.

Until the construction of the Rexburg Idaho Temple in 2008, BYU–Idaho had been the only college or university affiliated with the LDS Church that did not have a nearby temple.

=== Culture ===
Despite its transition from Ricks College to BYU-Idaho, leaders of the college have maintained the desire to preserve what they call the &quot;Spirit of Ricks,&quot; a campus tradition of service, hard work, friendliness, compassion and cooperation. The college&#x27;s relative geographic isolation from a metropolitan area, combined with the strong moral standards taught and encouraged by the college and its sponsoring organization, contribute to a unique student culture with some similarities to the other campuses owned by the LDS Church. Alcohol and drug use is virtually nonexistent, as these substances are strictly prohibited by the school&#x27;s honor code and the church. There is also no Greek system.

Much of BYU–Idaho student life revolves around events sponsored by the school organization &quot;Student Activities&quot;, which frequently hosts dances, concerts, sports events, and service projects.

Rexburg is situated in a strong northern climate in which winter dominates, and as such, winter sports such as downhill and cross-country skiing and snowboarding are popular. There are two nearby ski resorts, Grand Targhee and Kelly Canyon, which are frequented by students. However, Rexburg also experiences warm summers that are ideal for many outdoor recreational activities. The proximity of BYU-Idaho to both Grand Teton and Yellowstone national park, along with other state parks, national forests and nearby rivers make hiking, fishing, camping, mountain biking, and river floats popular summertime activities.

===Honor Code===

All students and faculty, regardless of religion, are required to agree to adhere to an honor code. Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy and educator Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the &quot;Domestic Organization&quot;, which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the school&#x27;s moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The honor code itself was created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. Ernest L. Wilkinson expanded the honor code in 1957 to include other school standards (at the time, Wilkinson, as president of BYU, and the director of what was then the Unified Church School System, had some authority over all of the church&#x27;s schools). The honor code today includes rules regarding dress, grooming, and academic honesty; it also prohibits extra-marital sex and homosexual behavior, alcohol, coffee, tea, and drugs. A signed commitment to live the honor code is part of the application process for all Latter-day Saint affiliated schools and must be adhered to by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the honor council. In rare cases, students and faculty can be expelled from the college for excessive misbehavior. In addition to the general honor code, other prohibited items include bib overalls, baseball caps (common at all Latter-day Saint schools, the BYU–Idaho Honor Code prohibits those items inside classrooms), flip-flops (sandals), and also any worn, faded, or patched clothing on campus.

Students and faculty must receive an ecclesiastical endorsement to be accepted to the college. To receive this endorsement, applicants meet with their local religious leaders and pledge their willingness to abide by the honor code. Once admitted, students then meet with their ecclesiastical leaders annually to renew this commitment. Ecclesiastical leaders may revoke a student or faculty member&#x27;s endorsement for any reason, which may lead to suspension or expulsion from the college.

Single students are required to live in housing that is approved by the college. All approved housing options are located within a mile of the college. Co-ed housing is prohibited according to the honor code but some complexes have separate buildings for men and women. Married students are not required to live in approved housing and may live wherever they choose.

===Health insurance===
As with most higher education institutions, full-time students are required to have health insurance. In fall 2019, BYU–Idaho announced that students may no longer receive a waiver that allows Medicaid to qualify as their health coverage. The decision brought significant media coverage. Students would have to seek other health insurance options, which may include purchasing the school&#x27;s student health plan. BYU–Idaho later reversed its decision, such that Medicaid would qualify under the requirement for students to have insurance.

==Alumni==
As of Fall 2017, BYU–Idaho had approximately 200,000 alumni, including those from the period when the institution functioned as an academy (equivalent to a modern high school). The college&#x27;s alumni include two-time Olympic gold medalist Rulon Gardner, Idaho State Senator Fred S. Martin, comedian Ryan Hamilton and professional baseball player Matt Lindstrom. Another alumnus is Marion G. Romney, a former counselor in the First Presidency of the LDS Church, who was valedictorian of the Ricks Academy class of 1918.

<doc id="543503" wikidata="Q7756888" url="?curid=543503" title="The Phil Silvers Show">
<text>The Phil Silvers Show, originally titled &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot;, is a sitcom which ran on the CBS Television Network from 1955 to 1959. A pilot titled &quot;Audition Show&quot; was made in 1955, but it was never broadcast. 143 other episodes were broadcast – all half-an-hour long except for a 1959 one-hour live special. The series starred Phil Silvers as Master Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko of the United States Army.

The series was created by Nat Hiken and won three consecutive Emmy Awards for Best Comedy Series. The show is sometimes titled &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot; or simply &quot;Bilko&quot; in reruns, and it is very often referred to by these names, both on-screen and by viewers. The show&#x27;s success transformed Silvers from a journeyman comedian into a star; and writer-producer Hiken from a highly regarded behind-the-scenes comedy writer into a publicly recognized creator.

== Production ==

By 1955, the American television business was already moving westward to Los Angeles, but Nat Hiken insisted on filming the series in New York City. He believed this location was more conducive to comedic creativity and the show&#x27;s humor. Early episodes were filmed at Dumont&#x27;s television center in New York City – now home to WNYW-TV – with later episodes shot at the CBS &quot;Hi Brown&quot; Studios in Chelsea, Manhattan.

Most of the series was filmed to simulate a live performance. The actors memorized their lines and performed the scenes in sequence before a studio audience. Thus, there are occasional flubs and awkward pauses. Actor Paul Ford, playing Bilko&#x27;s commanding officer, was notorious for forgetting his lines; when he would get a blank expression on his face, Silvers and the rest of the cast would improvise something to save the scene, like &quot;Oh, you remember, Colonel, the top brass is coming...&quot; At that point, Ford would pick up where he left off.

Creator Nat Hiken wrote or co-wrote 70 of the first 71 episodes, missing only episode 70 (the second-season finale.) He left the show after that season. In the fourth and fifth seasons there were numerous staff writers, and gaining prominence as the show went on was Neil Simon. Simon wrote or co-wrote 20 episodes, including the series finale. Future Columbia Pictures VP and theatrical agent Harvey Orkin, later known as a regular on &quot;Not So Much a Programme, More a Way of Life&quot;, was among the writers who were recognized with the Emmy Award for Best Comedy Writing in 1956.

Later episodes were filmed in California. Producer Mike Todd, making a guest appearance, insisted that his show should be filmed like a movie, out of sequence. The cast and crew tried it and soon found that Todd&#x27;s way was easier. Production continued in this manner until the series ended in 1959.

The fact that Silvers and Hiken were both sports fans inspired some of the character names. Bilko was named after Steve Bilko, a minor league baseball player (it also had the connotation, to &quot;&quot; someone). Cpl Barbella was named after middleweight boxing champion Rocky Graziano (whose birth name was Rocco Barbella). Pvt Paparelli was named after the baseball umpire Joe Paparella. According to Silvers, Pvt Doberman was so named because actor Maurice Gosfield resembled a doberman pinscher.

== Premise ==
The series was originally set in Fort Baxter, a sleepy, unremarkable U.S. Army post in the fictional town of Roseville, Kansas. It was centered on the soldiers of the Fort Baxter motor pool under Master Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko. Bilko and his men seemed to spend little time performing their duties: Bilko in particular spent most of his time trying to wheedle money through various get-rich-quick scams and promotions, or to find ways to get others to do his work for him.

While Bilko&#x27;s soldiers regularly helped him with his schemes, they were just as likely to become &quot;pigeons&quot; in one. Nevertheless, Bilko exhibited an odd paternalism toward his victims, and he would doggedly shield them from all outside antagonists. The sergeant&#x27;s attitude toward his men has been described thus: &quot;They were &quot;his&quot; men and if anyone was going to take them, it was going to be him and only him.&quot; Through it all, the platoon was generally loyal to Bilko, despite their wariness of his crafty nature, and they would depend on him to get them out of any military misfortune. If one of his boys was treated unfairly or was cheated in any way, Bilko always helped the injured party, using the same psychological guile and chicanery he used to outwit his suckers. This benevolent side of Bilko was toned down in the series&#x27;s later seasons (with scripts, significantly, by different writers); Bilko became strictly mercenary, willing to swindle &quot;anyone&quot; for a fast buck.

Bilko&#x27;s swindles were usually directed toward (or behind the back of) Col. John T. Hall, the overmatched and beleaguered post commander who had early in his career been nicknamed &quot;Melon Head&quot;. Despite his flaws and weaknesses, Col. Hall would get the best of Bilko just often enough to establish his credentials as a wary and vigilant adversary. The colonel would frequently be shown looking out his window, worried without explanation or evidence, simply because he knew that Bilko was out there &quot;somewhere&quot;, planning something. The colonel&#x27;s wife, Nell (Hope Sansberry), had only the kindest thoughts toward Bilko, who would shamelessly flatter her whenever he met her.

Bilko and Hall were not always adversaries. In an episode entitled &quot;The Court Martial&quot; (1956), Bilko tries to assist the colonel in setting a speed record for inducting new recruits, which accidentally results in a private&#x27;s pet chimpanzee being enrolled. The animal&#x27;s failure to answer when addressed by the phrase &quot;Hurry! Speak Up!&quot; is soon misheard and interpreted as being his name, &quot;Harry Speakup&quot;, continuing the error and the imposture. Harry passes the medical and psychiatric exams, receives a uniform, and is formally sworn in. With the superior officers in a panic, Bilko saves the day by orchestrating an honorable discharge for the chimpanzee.

The show&#x27;s setting changed with the fourth season, when the men of Fort Baxter were reassigned to Camp Fremont in California. This mass transfer was explained in storyline as being orchestrated by Bilko, who had discovered a map showing a gold deposit near the abandoned army post. One reason for the change from Kansas was so that the series could more plausibly bring in guest stars from nearby Hollywood, such as Dean Martin, Mickey Rooney, Diana Dors and Lucille Ball. Silvers played himself in one hourlong episode.

== Cast ==

Bilko&#x27;s right-hand men were Cpl. Rocco Barbella (Harvey Lembeck) and Cpl. Steve Henshaw (Allan Melvin), and his long-suffering superior was Col. John T. Hall (Paul Ford). Bilko&#x27;s motorpool platoon included Herbie Faye (a former burlesque crony of Silvers) as Cpl. Sam Fender, Maurice Gosfield as Pvt. Duane Doberman, Billy Sands as Pvt. Dino Paparelli, Mickey Freeman as diminutive Pvt. Fielding Zimmerman, Tige Andrews (billed under his given name, Tiger Andrews) as Pvt. Gander, Jack Healy as the tough-talking Pvt. Mullen, Maurice Brenner as Pvt. Irving Fleischman, Karl Lukas as Pvt. Stash Kadowski, former middleweight boxer Walter Cartier as botany fiend Pvt. Claude Dillingham (in season one), Bernie Fein as Pvt. Gomez, P.Jay Sidney as Pvt. Palmer and Terry Carter as Pvt. Sugarman. Sidney and Carter (and Billie Allen, who played WAC Billie) were African American and regularly appeared in the series at a time when American society (and television) was largely segregated. The Army was desegregated under President Harry Truman.

Other recurring characters included Hope Sansberry as Mrs. Hall, Harry Clark as camp cook Sgt. Stanley Sowici; after Clark&#x27;s death the role of cook was played by burlesque comic Joe E. Ross as Sgt. Rupert Ritzik; Beatrice Pons as loud-mouthed Mrs. Ritzik, Ned Glass as quartermaster Sgt. Andy Pendleton, Jimmy Little as Sgt. Francis Grover, Nicholas Saunders as Hall&#x27;s adjutant Captain Barker, and John Gibson as an unnamed Chaplain that Sgt. Bilko addressed as &quot;Padre&quot;. Some episodes gave Bilko a romantic interest, Elisabeth Fraser as Sgt. Joan Hogan.

The series frequently featured so many secondary cast members, with so many speaking parts, that the show ultimately became too expensive to sustain. It was this factor more than any significant decline in ratings that led to the show&#x27;s demise in 1959. Though &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; was never a huge ratings magnet, it was considered the top television comedy of its time. The show was nominated for Emmy Awards for both Comedy Writing and Best Series in all four of its seasons, winning both awards in 1956, 1957, and 1958. The series received nine other nominations during its run, with Silvers winning one individual Emmy for his performance and Nat Hiken winning one for direction. As Silvers later recalled, &quot;We went out at our height.&quot;

Guest stars included Alan Alda, Bea Arthur, Orson Bean, Peggy Cass, Dick Cavett, Arthur Duncan, Constance Ford, Eric Fleming, Dodie Goodman, Fred Gwynne, Bob Hastings, Paul Lynde, Julie Newmar, Tom Poston, Charlotte Rae, Paul Reed, Darryl Richard, Mark Rydell, Suzanne Storrs and Dick Van Dyke, then near the beginning of their careers. Later episodes used a wealth of veteran Hollywood character actors, including Harold Huber, Margaret Hamilton, Marjorie Gateson, Natalie Schafer and Frank Albertson.

George Kennedy was the show&#x27;s US Army technical adviser; he had roles as a military policeman in several episodes.

=== Finale ===
In the series finale, &quot;Weekend Colonel&quot;, Bilko discovers a short-order cook named Charlie Clusterman who is the exact double of Colonel Hall. Bilko hires the cook to impersonate the colonel, so he can cheat the other officers in a bogus charity effort. The real Colonel Hall learns of the scam, and Bilko, Henshaw, and Barbella end up being locked in the guardhouse. As Colonel Hall looks at his prisoners on a newly installed closed-circuit TV system, he quips: &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderful show, and as long as I&#x27;m the sponsor, it will never be cancelled.&quot; The camera cuts to Bilko and his henchmen finally behind bars. Bilko waves to the camera and says, &quot;Th-th-that&#x27;s all, folks!&quot;

== Aftermath ==
Following the show&#x27;s cancellation, CBS shortsightedly sold the rights to NBC: the rival network immediately aired reruns five days a week to great financial returns. Some of the show&#x27;s other actors were recruited by &quot;Bilko&quot; producer Edward J. Montagne to appear in Nat Hiken&#x27;s follow-up sitcom &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; and in &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;.

Silvers was able to parody, or play off, his enduring Bilko persona for the rest of his career. In 1963–1964, he starred in &quot;The New Phil Silvers Show&quot;, which attempted to transplant his mercenary character to a factory setting, but the result proved unpopular. Silvers frequently guest-starred on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; as a character called Honest John. He also played unscrupulous Broadway producer Harold Hecuba on an episode of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, stealing the castaways&#x27; concept for a musical version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In an episode of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, Silvers was a demanding efficiency expert; at one point, Lucy&#x27;s boss Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon), remarks that Silvers reminds him of a sergeant he used to know. Silvers also portrayed greedy connivers in various movies, such as &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963), in which Paul Ford had a supporting role as a colonel, though they shared no scenes, and &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966). The British film &quot;Follow That Camel&quot; (1967) cast him as a scheming sergeant, this time in the French Foreign Legion.

The original &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get Rich&quot; program, which was filmed in black-and-white, was widely rerun into the 1970s. The increasing prevalence of color television rendered it and many similar programs less marketable than they had been previously. The series reemerged in the late 1980s on the fledgling cable channel Comedy Central, then again on Nick at Nite for a short time during the 1990s (serving as charter programming for TV Land in 1996), and MeTV. In the United Kingdom the show enjoyed intermittent showings for many years, finally being broadcast on the BBC Two channel in 2004. Currently, it can be seen on Decades TV (a network broadcast on secondary television channels in many markets, and a sister channel to Me-TV, with CBS Television Stations owning the network with the owner of Me-TV, Weigel Broadcasting).

=== Legacy ===
The Bilko persona was borrowed by the Hanna-Barbera animation studio for its television cartoon series &quot;Top Cat&quot;, which drew on elements from &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;. Maurice Gosfield from the original platoon voiced Benny the Ball. &quot;Hokey Wolf&quot; was another Hanna-Barbera production that borrowed heavily from &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;. The episode of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; that introduced Dino gave the pet dinosaur a Sgt. Bilko-styled voice and character. After this atypical debut, Dino never spoke again. Another episode recruited Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble into the army, where they were conned by an unnamed Bilko-like character into becoming astronaut test pilots.

The film &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1962) used the names of several people associated with &quot;Sgt Bilko&quot; for the members of a Korean War patrol – Cpl Allan Melvin, Pvt Silvers, Pvt Hiken, and Pvt Lembeck. The characters also appear in the novel &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;, which has been plagued with multiple assertions of plagiarism.

In 1987, a British tourist visited Tibet wearing a Phil Silvers &quot;Sgt Bilko&quot; T-shirt. Chinese soldiers attempted to rip it off her because they thought the picture was the Dalai Lama.

Larry David, creator and star of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;, has called &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; his favorite television show.

From June 1957 to April 1960, DC Comics published a Sergeant Bilko comic book which lasted 18 issues and a Sergeant Bilko&#x27;s Private Doberman series that lasted 11 issues. Most of the covers and inside artwork were by Bob Oksner.

=== UK broadcasts ===
The series was shown weekly on BBC Television during its original run from 20 April 1957 onwards, in varying timeslots, with the final first-run episode &quot;Weekend Colonel&quot; airing on 15 January 1961. The series returned in repeats on BBC Television (later BBC1) from June 1961 to March 1967, after which it was absent from the screen until April 1973, when it returned in a late-night timeslot (although listed in &quot;Radio Times&quot; as &quot;Sergeant Bilko&quot;/&quot;Bilko&quot;), becoming a staple of BBC1&#x27;s post-11pm late-night schedule throughout the 1970s and 1980s, usually appearing immediately prior to the channel&#x27;s signoff (before BBC One, as the channel was now rendered, became a 24-hour broadcaster in November 1997). The series was moved to an early evening timeslot on BBC2, beginning a repeat run of all four seasons in broadcast order from 7 November 1984. This repeat run continued through to 22 November 1991, at which point the BBC had aired all available episodes. Episodes continued to be shown, although no longer in their original broadcast order, from 1993 to 2004, with the BBC&#x27;s last broadcast episode, &quot;Bilko and the Flying Saucers&quot;, appearing on 5 November 2004.

The UK publication &quot;Radio Times Guide to Comedy&quot; ranked &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; as its top TV sitcom in 2003.

Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko appeared on the B.B.C&#x27;s Tommy Trinder series &quot;The Trinder Box&quot; during June 1959. The &quot;Radio Times&quot; of 12 June 1959 had a full cover photo of Phil Silvers as Bilko.

=== Film ===

&quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; was the basis of a critically and commercially unsuccessful movie, &quot;Sgt. Bilko&quot; (1996), starring Steve Martin as Bilko, Dan Aykroyd as Colonel Hall, Max Casella as Paparelli, and Eric Edwards as Doberman, with Phil Silvers&#x27; daughter, Cathy Silvers, at Lt. Monday. The plot centers around an investigation into wrongdoings in Fort Baxter by Major Thorn (played by Phil Hartman), an old rival of Bilko&#x27;s, who will stop at nothing to get the better of Bilko.

<text>Long Point State Park (on Chautauqua Lake) is a state park located in the Town of Ellery, near the hamlet of Maple Springs in Chautauqua County, New York. The park is located on a short peninsula on the east side of the lake and can be reached on Route 430.

==History==
The park was formed from two gifts of former estates on Chautauqua Lake. The first estate was donated to New York State in 1956 by Mr. and Mrs. John W. Minturn; Mrs. Minturn was the granddaughter of former state governor Reuben E. Fenton. The park was expanded several years later with the gift of the summer estate of Bainbridge Colby, former United States Secretary of State under Woodrow Wilson.

==Facilities==
The park offers a beach, a playground, picnic tables and pavilions, a nature trail, showers, fishing, a boat launch with marine pump-out station, and cross-country skiing and snowmobiling.

<text>Niagara Falls State Park is located in the City of Niagara Falls in Niagara County, New York, United States. The park, recognized as the oldest state park in the United States, contains the American Falls, the Bridal Veil Falls, and a portion of the Horseshoe Falls (also known as the Canadian Falls).

==History==

Prior to being protected, the lands surrounding Niagara Falls on both sides of the river were largely controlled by private interests, and public access to the falls was limited. Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, an early champion of the falls&#x27; surroundings, began advocating for their preservation in the 1860s. In 1879, at the behest of the New York State Legislature, Olmsted and State Surveyor James T. Gardner helped prepare a special report on the falls&#x27; conditions, which argued for increased public access to the falls and recommended that the state purchase lands for that purpose. The report was followed by a publicity and petitioning campaign that helped bring the issue to the public&#x27;s attention.

Olmsted and others formed the Niagara Falls Association in 1883, a group that aimed to lobby New York to acquire and protect the falls from private exploitation. Their efforts succeeded later that year when, on April 30, 1883, a bill authorizing the &quot;selection, location and appropriation of certain lands in the village of Niagara Falls for a state reservation&quot; was signed into law by then-governor Grover Cleveland. The act led to the establishment of the Niagara Reservation in 1885. New York State Assemblyman Thomas Vincent Welch figured prominently in getting the bill signed, and served as the first Superintendent of the Park for 18 years from its inception until 1903.

Niagara Falls State Park is claimed to be the oldest continuously operating state park in the United States and the first established via eminent domain.

The impetus to protect the falls and improve their accessibility to the public was international; early lobbying for the park&#x27;s creation was bolstered by similar plans that were proposed for the Ontario side of the Niagara River. Although plans for an international park did not come to fruition, work to establish a park under Ontario provincial authority began in 1885, with the creation of the Niagara Parks Commission. The Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park, today known as Queen Victoria Park, was created in 1887.

The Niagara Reservation&#x27;s early design was accomplished by Olmsted and architect Calvert Vaux. The team completed their designs in 1887, with a focus on improving public access while preserving the landscape&#x27;s natural and scenic elements, to the exclusion of commercial and resort-style attractions.

The Niagara Reservation was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1963. It is a major contributing element to the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area.

A $44-million refurbishment of the park&#x27;s facilities was completed in 2003. Work focused on improvements to the park&#x27;s observation tower, visitor center, bridges, trails, and other infrastructure.

In 2007, Niagara Falls State Park was named as the 10th most beautiful spot in America by &quot;The Today Show&quot;.

==Park facilities==

In addition to its views of the American Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and the Canadian Falls, the park overlooks the Niagara Gorge and allows access to the Maid of the Mist tour boats, Cave of the Winds, Goat Island, the Prospect Point Observation Tower, a statue of Nikola Tesla, and the IMAX movie &quot;&quot; which is shown at the Niagara Adventure Theater.

The park also offers a museum, food concession, a movie theater, a gift shop, fireworks, hiking and nature trails, picnic tables, recreation programs, and fishing. The Top of the Falls Restaurant, on Goat Island overlooking the Horseshoe Falls, is also available within the park.

<doc id="543512" wikidata="Q210300" url="?curid=543512" title="Bačka">
<text>Bačka (, ) or Bácska (), is a geographical and historical area within the Pannonian Plain bordered by the river Danube to the west and south, and by the river Tisza to the east. It is divided between Serbia and Hungary. Most of the area is located within the Vojvodina region in Serbia and Novi Sad, the capital of Vojvodina, lies on the border between Bačka and Syrmia. The smaller northern part of the geographical area is located within Bács-Kiskun County in Hungary.

==Name==
According to Serbian historians, Bačka is a typical Slavic name form, created from &quot;Bač&quot; (name of historical town in Bačka) and suffix &quot;ka&quot; (which designates &quot;the land that belongs to Bač&quot;).

The name of &quot;Bač&quot; (Bács) town is of uncertain origin and its existence was recorded among Vlachs, Slavs and Hungarians in the Middle Ages. The origin of the name could be Paleo-Balkanic, Romanian, Slavic, or Old Turkic.

According to Hungarian historians, the denominator of the landscape may have been the first bailiff of Bač (Bács) castle, and the name which can be rendered probably Old Turkic &quot;baya&quot; derives from a dignity name.

In the 17th and 18th century, due to the large number of Serbs who lived in Bačka, this region was called »Raczorszag« (Hungarian for &quot;the Serb country&quot;). Sometimes, the Hungarians used name Délvidék (&quot;the southern or lower country&quot;) for a wider imprecisely defined geographical area, which, according to 19th century view also included Bačka. However, according to other Hungarian sources, Bačka was rather seen as part of Alföld.

==History==
Through history, Bačka has been a part of Dacia, the Kingdom of the Iazyges, the Hun Empire, the Gepid Kingdom, the Avar Khanate, the First Bulgarian Empire, the Great Moravia, the Kingdom of Hungary, the Serb realm of Jovan Nenad, the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburg monarchy, the Austrian Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Serbia, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro, and since 2006, it has been part of an independent Republic of Serbia. The smaller northern part of the region was part of the short-lived Serb-Hungarian Baranya-Baja Republic (in 1921) and part of independent Hungary since 1921.

People have inhabited the region of Bačka since Neolithic times. Indo-European peoples settled in this region in three migration waves dated in 4200 BC, 3300 BC, and 2800 BC respectively. The earliest historical inhabitants of the region were probably Illyrian tribes. Later, other Indo-European peoples, including Dacians, Celts, Sarmatians (Iazyges) and Gepids were recorded as inhabitants of Bačka.

===Middle Ages===
Slavs settled today&#x27;s Bačka in the 6th and 7th centuries, before part of them subsequently migrated to the Balkans. In the 9th century the territory of Bačka was part of Bulgarian Empire. Salan, a Bulgarian voivod (duke), was a ruler in this territory and his capital city was Titel. In the early 10th century, Hungarians defeated Salan, and his duchy came under Hungarian rule.


At the turn of the first millennium, during the administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary by Stephen I of Hungary, two counties (comitatus) were formed in this land. &quot;Bács County&quot; in the south, with city of Bács (now Bač) as its administrative centre and &quot;Bodrog County&quot; in the western and central territories with the historical city of &quot;Bodrogvár&quot; as capital (near the present-day village of Bački Monoštor). The two countries were later united to form Bács-Bodrog County. There were also territories of Csongrád County in the northeastern parts of Bačka. In 1085 King Ladislaus I made Bács the seat of the Archbishopric of Kalocsa-Bács. The first archbishop, Fabian (1085–1103) helped the king in the course of the campaign against Croatia and was rewarded with the title. According to Serbian sources, Ilija Vid, the first known prefect of Bacsensis County was recorded in 1068 and he was an ethnic Serb. In this time, the region was populated by both, Slavs and Hungarians. Serbian historian Dr. Milenko Palić also mentions that prefect Vid was an ethnic Serb and that he, together with two other ethnic Serbs whose names were Ilija and Radovan, participated in dynastic struggles in the Kingdom of Hungary, in the end of the 11th century. According to Hungarian authors, prefect Vid belonged to the Gutkeled genus, but there is a possibility that he was a fictitious person. In 1169, canons from the knighthood Order of the Holy Sepulchre built a small church in Bács in the Romanesque style. They used some building materials from much older previous edifices. Franciscans took over the church in 1300. In the second half of the 14th century, the Franciscans expanded it, forming a monastery. Today the Fanciscian monastery of Bács is the oldest church building in present-day Vojvodina. In the early 13th century Ugrin Csák, Archbishop of Kalocsa, founded a hospital in Bács, as the first such facility in this part of Europe. Pope Gregory IX wrote about the &quot;Bačka hospital&quot; in 1234, as being open for the sick and poor. At the beginning of the fourteenth century the town of Bács prospered during the rule of king Charles Robert I, who started building the modern fortress in 1338–42 at the site of the earlier hillfort. From the 15th century, it became the most important Hungarian defense point against the invading Ottoman forces.

===Early modern period===
In 1526 the Kingdom of Hungary was defeated in the Battle of Mohács by the Ottoman Empire, King Louis II fell in the battle. After the victorious campaign the Ottoman army led by Suleiman I withdrew from Hungary through the Danube–Tisza Interfluve, leaving only smaller garrisons in the fortifications. Within two to three weeks the retreating army killed approximately 400.000 men, burned down almost all the settlements, desolating the whole region. In this chaotic period took place the revolt of the Rascians and Bačka became (from 1526 to 1527) the central region of an independent, short-lived Serbian pseudostate, which existed in the territory of present-day Vojvodina. The ruler of this state was the self-appointed Emperor Jovan Nenad (previously the stableman of the king John Zápolya) and his capital city was Subotica. After Jovan Nenad was defeated and killed, his state collapsed and Bačka, for a short time, came again under Hungarian administration. Soon, the region became part of the Ottoman Empire.

After the Ottoman conquest, most of the previously decisive Hungarian majority population have fled (in the 16th–17th centuries). The relatively dense populated and prosperous southern counties of the Kingdom were devastated and became mostly abandoned and depopulated. During the Ottoman period, and later in the 17th and 18th century begun the intense settlement of the Serbs and other South Slavs from the Ottoman ruled central Balkans. They were military engaged in the borderlands by both sides. This resulted in radical changes of the population structure. Hungarian, Serb and Bunjevci peasants, and Serb and Vlach peasant soldiers lived (in ever-decreasing number) in the area, who had an impact on the landscape with their farming. In the Ottoman towns there was a Muslim population, and outside the city wall there were communities of various Christian denominations and occupations. Bačka was part of the Sanjak of Segedin (Szeged), the region was sparsely populated with Serbs (who were in an absolute majority) and Muslims.

During the Great Turkish War (1683–1699) on 11 September 1697, near Senta in the eastern Bačka took place one of the most decisive defeats in Ottoman history, the Battle of Zenta. Christian forces of the Holy League (1684) led by Prince Eugene of Savoy in a surprise attack destroyed the Ottoman army crossing the river Tisza. The battle resulted in a spectacular victory for Austria. As a result, in 1699 the Treaty of Karlowitz was signed, ending the Ottoman control in much of Central Europe. All the lands of the Kingdom of Hungary (except for Banat and a small chunk of Eastern Slavonia) conquered by the Ottomans in the previous 150 years were returned. Under the rule of Leopold I the Bačka became a possession of the Habsburg monarchy. Bács-Bodrog County was established in the western parts of the region and it was re-integrated into the county system of the Kingdom of Hungary, while some other (mostly eastern) parts of the Bačka were incorporated into the Tisza-Maros section of Habsburg Military Frontier, which was directly administered by the Imperial Habsburg court in Vienna. There were significant differences in the status of the inhabitants of the feudal county and the privileged newcome settlers of the Military Frontier, who composed mostly of ethnic Serbs. The Grenz infantry of the Military Frontier was primarily formed to defend Austria against the Ottoman Turks, but impliedly it was intended to offset and control the Hungarian population. This position was several times used by the Habsburg rulers as a political and tactical instrument in the following centuries.

In the Rákóczi&#x27;s War of Independence heavy fightings took place also in Bačka. In 1704 Francis II Rákóczi led a victorious campaign in this parts. The Serbs fought on the Emperor&#x27;s side since the beginning of the war. They were used as the light cavalry in the Austrian army and as tax collectors. During the eight years of war Hungarian villages and towns of the Great Hungarian Plain and Transdanubia were burnt and robbed by the Serbs, while in Bácska Serb villages were burnt. However, there were some Serbs who fought on Rakóczi&#x27;s side against the Habsburgs – the Frontiersmen of Semlak. The leader of the Kuruc Serb troops was Frontier Captain Obrad Lalić from Senta.
Later, some parts of the Military Frontier were abolished in 1751, these parts of Bačka were also included into Bács-Bodrog County. The only part of Bačka which remained within the Military Frontier was Šajkaška, but it also came under civil administration in 1873.

According to the Austrian censuses from 1715 to 1720, Serbs, Bunjevci, and Šokci comprised most of the region&#x27;s population (97.6% of population according to 1715–1720 census data). There were only 530 or 1.9% Hungarians and 0.5% Germans. During the 18th century, the Habsburgs carried out an intensive colonisation of the area, which had low population density after the last Ottoman Wars, as much of the Serbian population had been decimated through warfare. Muslim population had almost entirely left or was expelled from the region and some of the Muslim refugees from this area settled in Ottoman Bosnia. The new settlers in Bačka were primarily Serbs who moved from Ottoman Balkans, Hungarians - returning to Bačka from all parts of the Habsburg Hungary, and Germans. Because many of the Germans came from Swabia, they were known as &quot;Donauschwaben&quot;, or Danube Swabians. Some Germans also came from Austria, and some from Bavaria and Alsace. Lutheran Slovaks, Rusyns, and others were also colonized but to a much smaller extent.

There was also an emigration of Serbs from the eastern parts of the region, which belonged to Military Frontier until 1751. After the abolition of the Tisa-Mureş section of Military Frontier, many Serbs emigrated from north-eastern parts of Bačka. They moved either to Russia (notably to New Serbia and Slavo-Serbia) or to Banat, where the Military Frontier was still needed.

===19th century===
In 1848 and 1849, in the course of the Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence broke out the Serb uprising in the Délvidék. The rebels fought on the side of the Habsburg army (together with the German and Romanian regiments from Banat and numerous voluntiers from the Principality of Serbia) against the legitimate Hungarian government and the Hungarian Revolutionary Army. The fightings were characterized by largely ethnically motivated, bloody atrocities on the civilians, mostly executed by the irregular Serb forces. One of the most illustrative events was the &quot;Bloody Candlemas&quot; of 1849 in Senta (Hungarian: &quot;véres gyertyaszentelő&quot;). On 2 February the Serb forces overrun and conquered the city, resulting mass looting, arson and massacre of the Hungarian inhabitants. In the following weeks of the occupation 2000-2800 civilians were killed partially with the assistance of the local Serbs.
As the result of the uprising Bačka was proclaimed as part of the Serbian Voivodship, meant as a Serbian autonomous region within Austrian Empire, while between 1849 and 1860 it was part of the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, a separate Austrian crown land (the official languages of the voivodship were German and Illyrian, i.e. Serbo-Croatian). After 1860, when the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was abolished, Bács-Bodrog County was again formed in the territory of Bačka. The county was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, which became one of two constitutient parts of Austria-Hungary in 1867. According to the 1910 census, the population of Bačka numbered 704,563 people and was composed of: 43.2% speakers of Hungarian (310,490), 28.1% speakers of South Slavic (Serbo-Croatian) language and 22.5% speakers of German. Linguistic composition of the region is partially different from ethnic composition since some ethnic Jews and bilingual South Slavs were in this census recorded as speakers of Hungarian language.

===20th century===
In early September 1914, several years before the end of the Austria-Hungary, in a town in the West Vojvodina Bačka region known as Zombor or Sombor of some 30,000 people, including 12,000 Serb-speakers, popular demonstrations demanded the removal of all shop signs in the Cyrillic alphabet. When an angry mob chased one Serb-speaking shopkeeper to his home for refusing to remove his Cyrillic sign, he responded by shooting at the demonstrators. The local military commander demanded the shopkeeper&#x27;s immediate extradition, court martialed him and executed him on the spot. The court martial also designated twelve more affluent hostages from among the Serb-speaking population who would be &quot;arrested and immediately executed by the military authorities&quot; in the case of any obstruction or opposition shown by the local [Serb-speaking] population to the military authorities.&quot; This would presage the Serb genocide committed in the Independent State of Croatia during most of the Second World War.

At the end of October 1918, Austria-Hungary gradually dissolved and, with the Armistice of Villa Giusti of 3 November, officially capitulated to the Triple Entente. Following this capitulation, Slavs from Banat, Bačka and Baranja organized a new civil administration in these regions as well as their own military units known as People&#x27;s Guard (Serbian: &quot;Narodna straža&quot;). The new civil administration was composed of local People&#x27;s Boards (Serbian: &quot;Narodni odbori&quot;), which were subordinated to Serb People&#x27;s Board (Serbian: &quot;Srpski narodni odbor&quot;) in Novi Sad. Military units of Serb People&#x27;s Board also possessed aircraft from the Novi Sad Airport. After elections, which were organized between 18 and 24 November, Great People&#x27;s Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci and other Slavs of Banat, Bačka and Baranja (held on 25 November 1918) proclaimed unification of these regions with the Kingdom of Serbia. The assembly represented only a part of the whole population and did not met the principle of the self-determination of nations. It numbered 757 deputies, of which 578 were Serbs, 84 Bunjevci, 62 Slovaks, 21 Rusyn, 6 Germans, 3 Šokci, 2 Croats and 1 Hungarian, despite the fact that the absolute majority of the population of these regions was Hungarian and German. New administrative bodies of Banat, Bačka and Baranja (government and parliament) were also formed. Although, government in Belgrade accepted decision of unification with Serbia, it never recognized new provincial government. The provincial administration, however, was active until 12 March 1919, when it held its last session.

On 1 December 1918, the Kingdom of Serbia united with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs to form new country named the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Sovereignty of new kingdom was recognized by the Treaty of Saint Germain in 1919. The Treaty of Trianon of 4 June 1920 defined the exact borders between Hungary and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which was later renamed to Kingdom of Yugoslavia) and original territory of Bačka was divided between these two countries. The northern part of the region was a separate county of Hungary (Bács-Bodrog) with seat in Baja, which was later incorporated into Bács-Kiskun county. The southern part of the region was within the District of Novi Sad of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes between 1918 and 1922, then was divided between Bačka Oblast and Belgrade Oblast, provinces &quot;(oblasts)&quot; of the kingdom, between 1922 and 1929. In 1929, it was incorporated into Danube Banovina, which was a province of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Between 1820 and 1910, Hungarian speaking population in Bačka increased from 121,688 (31.5%) to 363,518 (44.75%). In the same time, percentage of South Slavs decreased from 44% in 1820 to 27% in 1910. 1921 census showed about 40,000 Hungarian speakers less than in census of 1910. This was especially case in Subotica where 1910 census recorded 55.587 speakers of Hungarian and 33,247 speakers of Bunjevac, while census of 1921 recorded 60,700 speakers of Serbo-Croatian and 26,750 speakers of Hungarian. This is explained by the fact that ethnic Bunjevci from Subotica who had knowledge of Hungarian language were listed as speakers of Hungarian by 1910 census. Between 1921 and 1931 census, number of Hungarian speakers in Bačka increased from 260,998 to 268,711. Slavic population increased by 91,800 inhabitants.

In 1941, Yugoslav Bačka was occupied by the Axis powers and attached to Horthy&#x27;s Hungary (but was still internationally recognized as part of Yugoslavia). Before this occupation, according to 1931 census, Yugoslav Bačka had 784,896 inhabitants, of whom there were 284,865 Yugoslavs (Serbs, Croats, Bunjevci, Šokci), 268,711 Hungarians and 169,858 Germans. Hungarian occupation authorities expelled several thousands of Serbs from the region and settled ethnic Hungarians from other parts of Central Europe in their place, so that the Hungarian census of 1941 recorded different a demographic composition in the region. According to this census, the territory of Bačka had 789,705 inhabitants, of which 45.4% or 47.2% were speakers of Hungarian language (not all of them native, however). During the occupation, Hungarian troops killed about 20,000 Serbs, Jews and Roma.

The occupation ended in 1944 and Yugoslav Bačka became part of the new Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (later the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). Following the defeat of the Axis troops, most of the German population that lived in the area left the region together with German army. The smaller part of the German population (several thousands of people) that did not leave the area (mostly women, children and the elderly) were sent to prison camps, where many of them died of malnutrition and disease. After the war, members of the Yugoslav Partisan army also killed several tens of thousands of inhabitants of German, Hungarian and Serb ethnic origin (in whole of Vojvodina). Estimates about numbers of victims of the Partisans (in whole of Vojvodina) are between 17,000 and 56,000 killed Germans, between 4,000 and 40,000 Hungarians killed, and about 23,000–24,000 Serbs killed.

Together with eastern Syrmia, western Banat, and northern Mačva, Yugoslav Bačka has been part of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina since 1945. After 1992, Yugoslav Bačka was part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (renamed Serbia and Montenegro in 2003), and since 2006 it has been part of the independent Republic of Serbia.

==Geography==
Bačka is a flat, fertile agricultural area within the larger Pannonian Plain, which was once the ancient Pannonian Sea. In Hungary, it is seen as a southern extension of the Great Alfold (itself part of the Pannonian Plain), while this designation is not used in Serbia where region is simply seen as a part of the Pannonian Plain. It lies between the River Danube to the west and south, and by the River Tisa (Tisza) to the east of which confluence is located near Titel in the South Bačka District of Serbia. The region is crisscrossed by parts of the Danube–Tisa–Danube Canal system which serves a variety of economic purposes. Almost all of Bačka is divided between Serbia and Hungary. However, there are small uninhabited pockets of the area on the left bank of the Danube which are &quot;de jure&quot; parts of Croatia according to the Badinter Commission; the disputed areas have been under &quot;de facto&quot; Serbian control since 1991.

Most of the territory and a vast majority of the population of Bačka is part of Serbia&#x27;s Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. This area within Serbia is officially divided into the districts of Southern Bačka, Western Bačka, and Northern Bačka. Novi Sad, the capital of Vojvodina, lies on the border between Bačka and Syrmia, on both banks of the river Danube. In some sources, Serbian part of Bačka is referred to as &quot;Central and Southern Bačka&quot; ( / Srednja i južna Bačka; ) or simply &quot;Southern Bačka&quot; ( / &quot;&quot;Južna Bačka; Dél-Bácska&quot;). The smaller part of the region in Hungary&#x27;s Bács-Kiskun County is, by the same sources, described as &quot;Northern Bačka&quot; (; / &quot;Severna Bačka&quot;).

<text>The red-faced malkoha (Phaenicophaeus pyrrhocephalus) is a member of the cuckoo order of birds, the Cuculiformes. This malkoha species is endemic to Sri Lanka

==Description==

This is a large species at 46 cm with a long graduated tail. Its back is dark green, and the uppertail is green edged with white. The belly and undertail are white, the latter being barred black. The crown and throat are black, and the lower face white. There is a large red patch around the eye and the bill is green. Sexual dimorphism present where males are having dark brown iris and females are with creamy white iris. Juveniles are with much duller plumage.

The red-faced malkoha takes a variety of insects including caterpillars, giant stick insects, mantises and small vertebrates such as lizard. It occasionally may eat berries but this needs confirmation.

Unlike most cuckoos, this is a quiet species, making only the odd soft grunt.

==Distribution==
It is endemic to Sri Lanka although some old records have apparently erroneously referred to its presence in southern India. According to Baker (1934), it is found in the &#x27;South of Travancore, where it was obtained by Stewart together with its nests&#x27;. Later, Biddulph reported a red-faced malkoha in Madurai district, southern Tamil Nadu. Thilo Hoffmann later pointed out that this record would not stand up to a modern records committee, and it is now best disregarded.

The presence of red-faced malkoha in the island is largely confined to the Sinharaja Forest Reserve and the surrounding vegetation, which is one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world.
==Habitat==
The red-faced malkoha is a bird of dense forests, where it can be difficult to see despite its size and colour. It prefers low country wet zone forests, sub-montane forests, montane forests and riverine forests in few dry zone forests in Sri Lanka. It can be seen in most of the largest rain forest patches in the wet zone and in dry zone Yala National Park, Lahugala National Park, Wasgamuwa National Park and Udawalawe National Park.

==Breeding biology==
It makes a deep cup nest in a well concealed foliage in sub canopy level, generally between 5-12 m height. The typical clutch being 2-3 eggs. Both male and females are engaging in nest building process.

==Behaviour==
They are found in nearly half of the mixed-species foraging flocks in the Sinharaja area.
Most of the individuals of Red-faced Malkohas which participate in the mixed-species bird flocks tend to prefer in the front of the flock. There is a high probability to see this cryptic bird in the flock if you observe the front half of the flock. 

==In culture==
The common name for this species &quot;malkoha&quot; is the vernacular name for the bird in Sinhala language. &#x27;Mal-Koha&#x27; translates to &#x27;flower-cuckoo&#x27;. The red-faced malkoha appears in a 5 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp.

<text>Fear and Desire is a 1952 American independent anti-war film directed, produced, and edited by Stanley Kubrick in his directorial debut, and written by Howard Sackler. With a production team of fifteen people, the film originally premiered at the Venice Film Festival, in a side program, under the title Shape of Fear. Though the film is not about any specific war, it was produced and released at the height of the Korean War.

==Plot==

&quot;Fear and Desire&quot; opens with an off-screen narration by actor David Allen who tells the audience:

There is a war in this forest. Not a war that has been fought, nor one that will be, but any war. And the enemies who struggle here do not exist unless we call them into being. This forest then, and all that happens now is outside history. Only the unchanging shapes of fear and doubt and death are from our world. These soldiers that you see keep our language and our time, but have no other country but the mind.

The story is set during a war between two unidentified countries. An airplane carrying four soldiers from one country has crashed six miles behind enemy lines. The soldiers come upon a river and build a raft, hoping they can use the waterway to reach their battalion. They meet and befriend a dog, and then, as they are building their raft, spot a house a distance away. Using binoculars, they spot a general occupying the house. When they see a plane overhead they go further into the woods, come upon a small house with enemy soldiers eating, and break in to kill them for their food and rifles.

The next day they leave and are approached by a young peasant girl who does not speak their language. The soldiers apprehend the girl and bind her to a tree with their belts. The youngest of them, Sidney, is left behind to guard the girl. He starts to talk to her, but as she does not understand him, he descends into a state of delirium. When he unbelts her, believing she will embrace him, she tries to escape and Sidney shoots her dead. Mac, another of the four soldiers, finds the dead girl and Sidney, who has gone mad. Sidney runs off towards the river.

Mac persuades the commander, Lt. Corby, and Fletcher to let him take the raft for a solo voyage, and they plan to kill the enemy general at the nearby base. Mac distracts the general&#x27;s guards by shooting at them while on the raft, and is himself wounded. While this is happening, Fletcher and Corby successfully infiltrate the base, kill the general, and use an enemy plane to escape to their home base. After landing, they talk and eat with their own general, and return to the river to await Mac. Sitting there, they philosophize about war and how no man is made for it, before finding the raft floating downriver, with a dying Mac and a delirious Sidney.

* David Allen as Narrator
* Frank Silvera as Sgt. Mac
* Kenneth Harp as Lt. Corby / The General
* Paul Mazursky as Pvt. Sidney

==Production==
Prior to shooting &quot;Fear and Desire&quot;, Kubrick was a &quot;Look&quot; photographer who had directed two short documentaries in 1951, &quot;Day of the Fight&quot; and &quot;Flying Padre&quot;. Both films were acquired for theatrical release by RKO Radio Pictures. From his experiences in creating short films, Kubrick felt he was ready to make a narrative feature film. Kubrick quit his full-time job with &quot;Look&quot; and set forth to create &quot;Fear and Desire&quot;.
The screenplay was written by Howard Sackler, a classmate of Kubrick&#x27;s at William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx, New York; Sackler later won the Pulitzer Prize for his 1968 drama &quot;The Great White Hope&quot;. Virginia Leith, who played The Girl in this film, went on to play Jan in the 1962 cult classic &quot;The Brain That Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot;. Paul Mazursky, who later received recognition as the director of such films as &quot;Harry and Tonto&quot; and &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;, was cast as the soldier who kills the captive peasant.

Funds for &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; were raised from Kubrick&#x27;s family and friends, with most of it coming from Martin Perveler, Kubrick&#x27;s uncle and the owner of a profitable pharmacy. The film&#x27;s original budget has been estimated at $10,000.

The production team consisted of 14 people: the director, five actors (Paul Mazursky, Frank Silvera, Kenneth Harp, Steve Coit, and Virginia Leith), five crew members (including Kubrick&#x27;s first wife, Toba Metz) and three Mexican laborers who transported the film equipment around California&#x27;s San Gabriel Mountains, where the film was shot. Due to budget limitations, Kubrick improvised in the use of his equipment. To create fog, Kubrick used a crop sprayer, but the cast and crew was nearly asphyxiated because the machinery still contained the insecticide used for its agricultural work. For tracking shots, Paul Mazursky recalled how Kubrick came up with a novel substitute: &quot;There was no dolly track, just a baby carriage to move the camera&quot;, he told an interviewer.

To reduce production costs, Kubrick had intended to make it a silent picture, but in the end the adding of sounds, effects and music brought the production over budget to around $53,000, and had to be bailed out by producer Richard de Rochemont, on condition that he help in de Rochemont&#x27;s production of a five-part program about Abraham Lincoln for the educational TV series &quot;Omnibus&quot;, filmed on location in Hodgenville, Kentucky. Kubrick also ran into difficulty in editing a key scene where one of the soldiers throws a plate of beans to the floor and enters the frame from the wrong side. Kubrick&#x27;s blocking of the crucial scene was faulty, and his actors accidentally crossed the so-called &quot;stage line&quot;; this required the negative to be flipped in the printing process to preserve continuity, which was another expense.

==Release==

The film was first shown at the Venice Film Festival in August 1952 under the title &quot;Shape of Fear&quot;, in the section called &quot;Festival of the Scientific Film and Art Documentary&quot;. It was later picked up for U.S. theatrical release by Joseph Burstyn, a distributor and war veteran who specialized in the presentation of European art house titles. The film was renamed &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; and was distributed with the tagline &quot;Trapped ... 4 Desperate Men and a Strange Half-Animal Girl!&quot; In an uncredited review following the New York premiere, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted: &quot;If &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; is uneven and sometimes reveals an experimental rather than a polished exterior, its overall effect is entirely worthy of the sincere effort put into it.&quot;

===Critical response===
Kubrick received praise for &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; from film critic and screenwriter James Agee, who reportedly took Kubrick out for a drink and told him, &quot;There are too many good things ... to call [&quot;Fear and Desire&quot;] arty.&quot; Columbia University professor Mark Van Doren sent Kubrick a letter that stated: &quot;The incident of the girl bound to the tree will make movie history once it is seen ... Stanley Kubrick is worth watching for those who want to discover high talent at the moment it appears.&quot;

&quot;Fear and Desire&quot; was not a box office success, and Kubrick had to take a for-hire job directing the promotional short &quot;The Seafarers&quot; on behalf of the Seafarers International Union in order to raise funds for his next planned feature, &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (1955), which was co-written by Kubrick and Howard Sackler and star Frank Silvera, one of the &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; actors.

===Disappearance and rediscovery===
In the years following its release, &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; seemed to have disappeared. Distributor Joseph Burstyn died in November 1953 on a trans-Atlantic flight, and his company went out of business. Kubrick tried to burn the film&#x27;s original negative and sought to destroy any leftover prints after the failed film fell out of circulation following Burstyn&#x27;s death. However, some prints of the film remained in private collections.

&quot;Fear and Desire&quot; had its first retrospective screening at the 1993 Telluride Film Festival. In January 1994, the Film Forum, a nonprofit art and revival theater in lower Manhattan, announced plans to show &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; on a double bill with &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot;. Although the film&#x27;s copyright lapsed and the property was in the public domain, thus allowing it to be shown without fear of legal actions, Kubrick tried to discourage it from gaining an audience. Through Warner Brothers, Kubrick issued a statement that severely downplayed the film&#x27;s value, and he called &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; &quot;a bumbling amateur film exercise&quot;.

There have been very few public screenings of &quot;Fear and Desire&quot;; the only commercially available print belongs to the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. Among the rare presentations were a 1993 screening at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., a 2003 one-time screening at the Two Boots Den of Cin in New York City and an August 2008 presentation at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio. Additionally, some clips from the film were included in the 2001 documentary &quot;Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures&quot;.

In 2010, an original copy of the film was discovered at a Puerto Rican film laboratory.

On December 14, 2011, Turner Classic Movies aired a print restored by George Eastman House.

Kino Video released a DVD and Blu-ray on October 23, 2012, and it was released the following year by British company Eureka Entertainment as part of its Masters of Cinema line.

<text>Cheesequake State Park is a state park located in Old Bridge, Middlesex County, New Jersey, in the United States.

The New Jersey Legislature allocated $100,000 in 1937 to purchase property for the park. The state first acquired a tract of farmland and a Civil War-era mansion from the Favier brothers in January 1938. Additional lands were acquired over the next two years, and the Civil Conservation Corps, part of the Works Progress Administration, helped develop the property. The park was opened in June 1940. It is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry and is part of the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route.

The name Cheesequake has been variously described as deriving from the Lenape words &quot;Cheseh-oh-ke&quot; (&quot;upland&quot;), &quot;Chichequaas&quot; (&quot;upland village&quot;), or &quot;Chiskhakink&quot; (&quot;at the land that has been cleared&quot;).

==Geography, flora, and fauna==

The park&#x27;s lowlands consist of freshwater and saltwater marsh and a tidal estuary near the mouth of Cheesequake Creek on the Raritan Bay. It also includes hills of Northeastern hardwood forest, open fields, and a white cedar swamp. It includes a small parcel of Atlantic coastal pine barrens, consisting of pine forest in sandy soil, an isolated section of the much larger New Jersey Pine Barrens. It also includes the Hooks Creek Lake, a freshwater lake where recreational fishing features trout, largemouth bass, catfish, and sunfish. Crabbing is also available at the park.

==Facilities, activities, and trails==

The park includes an interpretive center and five marked trails for both hiking and mountain biking that run throughout the wooded hills and across long wooden bridges across marshland. The park has designated camping areas available by reservation. Swimming and boating are summertime activities, while sledding, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing are available in wintertime.

The Garden State Parkway runs through the park near exit 120 but offers no direct access. A road runs underneath the parkway to connect the northern and southern sides of the park. Parts of the park, including a picnic area, are visible from the parkway. Aberdeen-Matawan station (New Jersey Transit) is located about two miles east of the park.

<doc id="543568" wikidata="Q1093427" url="?curid=543568" title="Lorentz covariance">
<text>In relativistic physics, Lorentz symmetry or Lorentz invariance, named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, is an equivalence of observation or observational symmetry due to special relativity implying that the laws of physics stay the same for all observers that are moving with respect to one another within an inertial frame. It has also been described as &quot;the feature of nature that says experimental results are independent of the orientation or the boost velocity of the laboratory through space&quot;.

Lorentz covariance, a related concept, is a property of the underlying spacetime manifold. Lorentz covariance has two distinct, but closely related meanings:

# A physical quantity is said to be Lorentz covariant if it transforms under a given representation of the Lorentz group. According to the representation theory of the Lorentz group, these quantities are built out of scalars, four-vectors, four-tensors, and spinors. In particular, a Lorentz covariant scalar (e.g., the space-time interval) remains the same under Lorentz transformations and is said to be a &quot;Lorentz invariant&quot; (i.e., they transform under the trivial representation).
# An equation is said to be Lorentz covariant if it can be written in terms of Lorentz covariant quantities (confusingly, some use the term &quot;invariant&quot; here). The key property of such equations is that if they hold in one inertial frame, then they hold in any inertial frame; this follows from the result that if all the components of a tensor vanish in one frame, they vanish in every frame. This condition is a requirement according to the principle of relativity; i.e., all non-gravitational laws must make the same predictions for identical experiments taking place at the same spacetime event in two different inertial frames of reference.

On manifolds, the words &quot;covariant&quot; and &quot;contravariant&quot; refer to how objects transform under general coordinate transformations. Both covariant and contravariant four-vectors can be Lorentz covariant quantities.

Local Lorentz covariance, which follows from general relativity, refers to Lorentz covariance applying only &quot;locally&quot; in an infinitesimal region of spacetime at every point. There is a generalization of this concept to cover Poincaré covariance and Poincaré invariance.

==Examples==

In general, the (transformational) nature of a Lorentz tensor can be identified by its tensor order, which is the number of free indices it has. No indices implies it is a scalar, one implies that it is a vector, etc. Some tensors with a physical interpretation are listed below.

The sign convention of the Minkowski metric is used throughout the article.

===Scalars===

;Spacetime interval:formula_1
;Proper time (for timelike intervals):formula_2
;Proper distance (for spacelike intervals):formula_3
;Mass:formula_4
;Electromagnetism invariants:formula_5
;D&#x27;Alembertian/wave operator:formula_6

===Four-vectors===
;4-displacement: formula_7
;4-position: formula_8
;4-gradient: which is the 4D partial derivative: formula_9
;4-velocity: formula_10 where formula_11
;4-momentum: formula_12 where formula_13 and formula_14 is the rest mass.
;4-current: formula_15 where formula_16
;4-potential: formula_17

===Four-tensors===

;Kronecker delta:formula_18
;Minkowski metric (the metric of flat space according to general relativity):formula_19
;Electromagnetic field tensor (using a metric signature of + − − −):formula_20
;Dual electromagnetic field tensor:formula_21

==Lorentz violating models==
In standard field theory, there are very strict and severe constraints on marginal and relevant Lorentz violating operators within both QED and the Standard Model. Irrelevant Lorentz violating operators may be suppressed by a high cutoff scale, but they typically induce marginal and relevant Lorentz violating operators via radiative corrections. So, we also have very strict and severe constraints on irrelevant Lorentz violating operators.

Since some approaches to quantum gravity lead to violations of Lorentz invariance, these studies are part of phenomenological quantum gravity. Lorentz violations are allowed in string theory, supersymmetry and Hořava–Lifshitz gravity.

Lorentz violating models typically fall into four classes:

* The laws of physics are exactly Lorentz covariant but this symmetry is spontaneously broken. In special relativistic theories, this leads to phonons, which are the Goldstone bosons. The phonons travel at &quot;less&quot; than the speed of light.
* Similar to the approximate Lorentz symmetry of phonons in a lattice (where the speed of sound plays the role of the critical speed), the Lorentz symmetry of special relativity (with the speed of light as the critical speed in vacuum) is only a low-energy limit of the laws of physics, which involve new phenomena at some fundamental scale. Bare conventional &quot;elementary&quot; particles are not point-like field-theoretical objects at very small distance scales, and a nonzero fundamental length must be taken into account. Lorentz symmetry violation is governed by an energy-dependent parameter which tends to zero as momentum decreases. Such patterns require the existence of a privileged local inertial frame (the &quot;vacuum rest frame&quot;). They can be tested, at least partially, by ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments like the Pierre Auger Observatory.
* The laws of physics are symmetric under a deformation of the Lorentz or more generally, the Poincaré group, and this deformed symmetry is exact and unbroken. This deformed symmetry is also typically a quantum group symmetry, which is a generalization of a group symmetry. Deformed special relativity is an example of this class of models. The deformation is scale dependent, meaning that at length scales much larger than the Planck scale, the symmetry looks pretty much like the Poincaré group. Ultra-high energy cosmic ray experiments cannot test such models.
* Very special relativity forms a class of its own; if charge-parity (CP) is an exact symmetry, a subgroup of the Lorentz group is sufficient to give us all the standard predictions. This is, however, not the case.

Models belonging to the first two classes can be consistent with experiment if Lorentz breaking happens at Planck scale or beyond it, or even before it in suitable preonic models, and if Lorentz symmetry violation is governed by a suitable energy-dependent parameter. One then has a class of models which deviate from Poincaré symmetry near the Planck scale but still flows towards an exact Poincaré group at very large length scales. This is also true for the third class, which is furthermore protected from radiative corrections as one still has an exact (quantum) symmetry.

Even though there is no evidence of the violation of Lorentz invariance, several experimental searches for such violations have been performed during recent years. A detailed summary of the results of these searches is given in the Data Tables for Lorentz and CPT Violation.

Lorentz invariance is also violated in QFT assuming non-zero temperature.

There is also growing evidence of Lorentz violation in Weyl semimetals and Dirac semimetals.

<text>Evangola State Park is a state park in southern Erie County, New York, United States. The park is located west of the Village of Farnham, at the border of the Town of Brant and the Town of Evans. The park, which opened in 1954, fronts on Lake Erie, and has a large swimming beach bordered by cliffs of Angola shale.
 
==Park description==
Evangola State Park is open year-round from dawn to dusk, and offers a beach, picnic tables and pavilions, seasonal pheasant and small game hunting, hiking and biking, nature trails (park wildlife includes white-tailed deer, raccoons, turkey, and red-tailed hawks), a playground and playing fields (baseball, tennis, basketball), a disc golf course, fishing, ice-fishing, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing. The park&#x27;s swimming beach was identified as the second-least polluted beach in Erie County based on water sampling in 2013.

From mid-April to late October, 80 campsites are available for public use, offering both tent options and trailer sites. Flush toilets and hot showers are available in the park. There is also 5 yurts that sleeps six. In 2007, Evangola was named one of the Top 100 campgrounds in the nation by ReserveAmerica.

The park is also available for weddings, and includes a gazebo overlooking Lake Erie. There is also a 125-person banquet room overlooking the beach. The park hosts the Tomato Festival each year on the last full weekend of August.

The park also offers a variety of programs led by park naturalists.

<doc id="543579" wikidata="Q4964642" url="?curid=543579" title="Brian Maxwell">
<text>Brian Leigh Maxwell (March 14, 1953 – March 19, 2004) was a British born Canadian track and field athlete, track coach, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He founded PowerBar, a maker of energy and nutritional products for athletes. Maxwell initially never intended to become a marathon runner, but lacked the speed necessary to be competitive at shorter distances. Despite being told as a teenager of his congenital heart condition, he persevered, and by 1977, he was ranked third among all marathoners by &quot;Track and Field News&quot;. At age 51, he died of a heart attack at a local post office.

==Early life==
Maxwell grew up in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he attended Victoria Park Secondary School (now Victoria Park Collegiate Institute), and he was a member of the Victoria Park Track Club (not associated with the school). The club was coached by Commonwealth Games shot put gold medalist Dave Steen. While at Victoria Park, he was awarded the Arnold Trophy for excellence in academics and athletics.

In 1975, Maxwell graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in architecture from the University of California, Berkeley, where he was on the Golden Bears track team. As an outstanding student on the team, he won the Brutus Hamilton Award, named after the University&#x27;s long-time coach.

==Elite athlete and coach==
After graduating from UC Berkeley, Maxwell frequently represented Canada as a long distance runner. He won his first marathon, in 1975, in Canada, and competed in the 1978 Commonwealth Games. He was the top qualifier for the three-member Canadian 1980 Olympic marathon team that did not participate in the games in Moscow due to the U.S.-led boycott. His fastest marathon was 2:14:43 in 1977. He won the Ottawa National Capitol Marathon that year. He also won the Enschede, Netherlands marathon that year, in 2:15:14, breaking Ron Hill&#x27;s course record. Maxwell went on to serve as the cross country and distance running coach at UC Berkeley, helping four team members become NCAA Division I All-Americans in cross country and track and field. Tom Downs, Jr., the first of those at Berkeley to win that honor when he finished 13th at the nationals in 1981, attributed that to Maxwell&#x27;s regimen of having his runners alternate easy and very hard training days, to push them to their limits.

==PowerBar==
Maxwell started the PowerBar company with his girlfriend, Jennifer Biddulph, a nutritionist who later became his wife. Maxwell developed the idea of an energy bar after dropping out of a marathon at , at about the segment of the event known among runners as &quot;The Wall&quot;, where experts say the body ceases burning carbohydrates and begins burning muscle tissue instead. In the kitchen of their Berkeley, California home, the couple began developing snack bar recipes with both simple and complex carbohydrates.

==Other business interests==
In late 2000, Maxwell invested in the Active Network Inc. (Active.com), helping establish the company as the leading provider of data management and online registration services for fitness events. By 2001, Maxwell joined Active&#x27;s board of directors. He also chaired Game Ready, which manufactured devices to assist healing of sports injuries.

==Legacy==
In addition to helping promote many fitness events and sponsoring numerous athletes, Maxwell and his wife contributed generously to UC Berkeley, from which both graduated. The former Kleeberger Field was renamed Maxwell Family Field after the couple donated funds to replace the artificial surface. Located just north of UC Berkeley&#x27;s Memorial Stadium, the field serves as home to the university&#x27;s hockey, football and lacrosse programs. Jennifer Maxwell also endowed a full-tuition scholarship, the Brian L. Maxwell Fellowship, at the Haas School of Business. Maxwell Fellowships are intended to memorialize the drive, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit which led Maxwell to achieve success in business and his athletic pursuits. There has been an annual award named after Maxwell at the high school he attended, Victoria Park Collegiate Institute, which is given to a student who excels in athletics and academics while at Victoria Park. He also donated the well-equipped Fitness Room at the Institute.

Maxwell is survived by his wife, Jennifer, and six children. Their daughter, Julia, was a standout cross country runner, and her mother and grandmother, Barbara Magid, were top competitors in the arduous and venerable age-and-gender handicapped Dipsea Race, first run in 1905. Julia finished fourth in that competition at 13-years-old. Julia competed for Stanford University where she received a double major degree in nutrition and anthropology.

<text>Belmont Lake State Park is a day-use state park located in North Babylon, New York, United States on Long Island.

==History==
Belmont Lake State Park was established in 1926 on land that was formerly part of the &quot;Nursery Stud Farm&quot;, a Thoroughbred horse farm owned by August Belmont, namesake of the Belmont Stakes.

The park was selected by Robert Moses as regional headquarters for all state parks on Long Island in 1935. The park served as the headquarters of the Long Island State Park Commission and Long Island State Parkway Police from their founding in 1946 until their disbandment in 1977 and 1980, respectively. It now serves as the headquarters of the Long Island region of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, as well as the New York State Park Police.

==Park description==
Belmont Lake State Park is a day-use park, featuring boating and picnicking facilities in addition to playing fields for popular sports. Two modern children&#x27;s playgrounds are also available. Pedal boats, rowboats and kayaks can be rented at the boat dock from May through Columbus Day. 

The park is located near the Southern State Parkway at Exit 38. Bike and pedestrian entrances exist at several points around the perimeter which are free all year long. The park also contains a bicycle path leading to Southards Pond and Argyle Lake in the Village of Babylon.

<doc id="543598" wikidata="Q1412461" url="?curid=543598" title="Psephology">
<text>Psephology (; from Greek ) is the study of elections and voting. Psephology attempts to both forecast and explain election results. 
The term is more common in Britain and in those English-speaking communities that rely heavily on the British standard of the language.

Psephology uses historical precinct voting data, public opinion polls, campaign finance information and similar statistical data. The term was coined in 1948 by W. F. R. Hardie (1902–1990) in the United Kingdom after R. B. McCallum, a friend of Hardie&#x27;s, requested a word to describe the study of elections. Its first documented usage in writing appeared in 1952.

==Etymology==
The term draws from the Greek word for pebble as the ancient Greeks used pebbles to vote. (Similarly, the word ballot is derived from the medieval French word &quot;ballotte,&quot; meaning a small ball.)

==Applications==

Psephology is a division of political science that deals with the examination as well as the statistical analysis of elections and polls. People who practise psephology are called psephologists.

A few of the major tools that are used by a psephologist are historical precinct voting data, campaign finance information, and other related data. Public opinion polls also play an important role in psephology. Psephology also has various applications specifically in analysing the results of election returns for current indicators, as opposed to predictive purposes. For instance, the Gallagher Index measures the amount of proportional representation in an election.

Degrees in psephology are not offered (instead, a psephologist might have a degree in political science and/or statistics). Knowledge of demographics, statistical analysis and politics (especially electoral systems and voting behaviour) are prerequisites for becoming a psephologist.

==Notable psephologists==
Notable psephologists include: 
* Allan Lichtman, professor and creator of The Keys to the White House
* Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Christopher Bates, who together write the daily electoral-vote.com website, which tracks polling for US presidential and congressional elections
* Antony Green, election analyst for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation since 1991 
* Charlie Cook, publisher of &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot;
* Curtis Gans, author of &quot;Voter Turnout in the United States, 1788–2009&quot;
* David Andrews, who since 1973 has led the Canadian network CTV&#x27;s analysis and &quot;calling&quot; of dozens of federal and elections and referendums
* David Butler and Robert McKenzie, who co-developed the swingometer
* Éric Grenier at thewrit.ca
* Frank Luntz received the first ever doctorate in campaign technology from Trinity College, Oxford and won the Washington Post Crystal Ball award for most accurate polling
* John Curtice, who has a strong track record of forecasting UK elections
* Malcolm Mackerras (who devised the Mackerras pendulum)
* Michael Barone, who has co-authored &quot;The Almanac of American Politics&quot; biennially since 1972
* Michael Gallagher who devised the Gallagher index
* Nate Silver, creator of the website FiveThirtyEight tracking U.S. voting trends
* Pradeep Gupta, chairman of Axis My India
* Thomas Ferguson, for his Investment theory of party competition
* V.C. Sekhar, an Indian academic
* Noel Whelan, Irish politician and psephologist
* Yogendra Yadav, Indian politician and psephologist

<text>Les Cowboys Fringants () are a Quebecker folk rock band formed in 1995 in Repentigny, Quebec. The French word &quot;fringant&quot; can be translated as &quot;dashing&quot;, or &quot;frisky&quot;.

They perform &quot;Quebecker&quot; néo-trad music (modernized Quebec folk music with a rock flavour) and draw on country music. They have an international underground following, especially in France, French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland. Band members hail from the Montreal suburbs of Repentigny and L&#x27;Assomption. The entire band collaborates on the lyrics, although guitarist Jean-François Pauzé often contributes more than the others. The band are known for their live performances, captured on the &quot;Attache ta tuque!&quot; live album and the &quot;Centre Bell 30 décembre 2003&quot; DVD.

The band has won 17 Félix Awards, including five at the 2020 edition of the ceremony.

==Overview==
&quot;Les Cowboys&quot; represent an important part of modern &quot;Québécois&quot; music. They are part of the néo-trad movement that appeared in Quebec around the turn of the 21st century, and they embody a resurgence of political songwriting. As the néo-trad movement adapts Quebec folklore into contemporary crafts, the political message of the band is a re-occurrence of 1970s chansonnier activist messages of left-wing solidarity and, recently, sovereignism. They also sometimes adopt a minimalist and dadaesque style, a trend of the Quebec music scene of the 2000s – a decade of voluntary simple yet nonetheless quite intelligent and joual lyrics, therefore subversive and akin to a sort of lyrical naïve art.

The group&#x27;s songs cover environmentalism, and poverty, as well as the denouncing of consumerism, exploitation, state-controlled gambling, and political apathy. While some of those subjects are serious in appearance, they are often treated in a light manner, sometimes even in a fun or ironic way. The band also deals with themes of Quebec history, Quebec independence, suburban life, childhood and adolescence, kitsch, relationships and sports. Their songwriting is renowned for having woven an elaborate tapestry of fictional characters with interpersonal relationships, and sometimes a number of these characters appear in more than one song. Much like their writing, the clothes of the male members of the band are quite unique, sometimes purposely &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;kitsch&quot; and something of a postmodern, second degree artistic statement.

The band themselves are noted fans of &quot;Passe-Partout&quot; composer Pierre F. Brault and have performed shows in his honour. They have also been influenced by French singer Renaud, and his songs with political messages and local popular language.

Many of the idiosyncrasies of their music stem from Marie-Annick Lépine, a versatile musician, who makes the band line-up distinct from the conventional guitar-bass-drums-singer. Her talents contribute to the vivacious sounds of instruments like the violin, mandolin and accordion.

The band went on tour in summer of 2011, visiting cities in Quebec, France and Switzerland.

In 2021, the band released a concert film, &quot;L&#x27;Amérique pleure&quot;, featuring songs performed in wild locations in Quebec, directed by Louis-Philippe Eno. It was released as an on-demand digital film.

In 2022, the group&#x27;s lead singer, Karl Tremblay, announced that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. They paused most recording and touring activity as he pursued treatment, except for a performance at the Festival d&#x27;été de Québec in July 2023. Tremblay&#x27;s death was announced on November 15, 2023.

Their 2023 album &quot;En concert avec l’Orchestre symphonique de Montréal (sous la direction du chef Simon Leclerc)&quot;, recorded with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, won the Juno Award for Francophone Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2024.

In 2024 they released &quot;Pub Royal&quot;, an album including the last songs Tremblay completed before his death. A jukebox musical of the same name, featuring the band&#x27;s songs performed by musical theatre actors, also launched the same year.

<doc id="543618" wikidata="Q814751" url="?curid=543618" title="Menahem Mendel Beilis">
<text>Menahem Mendel Beilis (1874 – July 7, 1934; sometimes spelled Beiliss) was a Russian Jew accused of ritual murder in Kiev in the Russian Empire in a notorious 1913 trial, known as the &quot;Beilis trial&quot; or the &quot;Beilis affair&quot;. Although Beilis was eventually acquitted after a lengthy process, the legal process sparked international criticism of antisemitism in the Russian Empire.

Beilis&#x27;s story was fictionalized in Bernard Malamud&#x27;s 1966 novel &quot;The Fixer&quot;, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction.

==Biography==

Menahem Mendel Beilis was born into a Hasidic family. In 1911, he was an ex-soldier and the father of five children. He was employed as a superintendent at the Zaitsev brick factory in Kiev.

==Murder of Andriy Yushchinskyi==

On March 12, 1911, a 13-year-old boy named Andriy Yushchinskyi disappeared on his way to school. Eight days later, his mutilated body was discovered in a cave near the Zaitsev brick factory. Beilis was arrested on July 21, 1911, after a lamplighter testified that the boy had been kidnapped by a Jew. A report submitted to Tsar Nicholas II by the judiciary named Beilis as the murderer.

Beilis spent over two years in prison awaiting trial. Meanwhile, an antisemitic campaign was launched in the Russian press against the Jewish community, with accusations of ritual murder. Among those who wrote or spoke against these false accusations were Maxim Gorky, Vladimir Korolenko, Alexander Blok, Alexander Kuprin, Vladimir Vernadsky, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi and Pavel Milyukov.

Beilis had been in prison for over a year when a delegation led by a military officer came to his cell. In what might have been a ploy to get Beilis to incriminate himself or other Jews, the officer informed Beilis that he would soon be freed due to a manifesto pardoning all &quot;katorzhniks&quot; (convicts at hard labor) on the tercentenary jubilee of the reign of the Romanov dynasty. As related in his memoir, Beilis refused this overture:

:“That manifesto,” said I, “will be for &quot;katorzhniks&quot;, not for me. I need no manifesto, I need a fair trial.”
:“If you will be ordered to be released, you&#x27;ll have to go.”
:“No – even if you open the doors of the prison, and threaten me with shooting, I shall not leave. I shall not go without a trial.”

This is one of many incidents from Beilis&#x27;s memoir that Bernard Malamud incorporated in his novel &quot;The Fixer&quot;.

==The trial==


The Beilis trial took place in Kiev from September 25 through October 28, 1913. The prosecution was composed of the government&#x27;s best lawyers. Professor Sikorsky of Kiev State University (father of Igor Sikorsky), a medical psychologist, testified as an expert witness for the prosecution that in his opinion it was a case of ritual murder.

Beilis had a strong alibi due to the fact that he worked on the Jewish Sabbath. Yushchinskyi was abducted on a Saturday morning, when Beilis was at work, as confirmed by his Gentile co-workers. Receipt slips for a shipment of bricks signed by Beilis that morning were produced as evidence. The prosecution argued that Beilis could have gone out for a few minutes, kidnapped Yushchinskyi, and then returned to work.

Internal police documents from 1912 subsequently revealed that the weakness of the case was known.

===Prosecution expert===
One prosecution witness, presented as an expert in Judaic rituals, was a Lithuanian Catholic priest, Justinas Pranaitis from Tashkent, well known for his antisemitic 1892 work &quot;Talmud Unmasked&quot;. Pranaitis testified that the murder of Yushchinskyi was a religious ritual. One police department official is quoted as saying:

:&quot;The course of the trial will depend on how the ignorant jury will perceive arguments of priest Pranaitis, who is sure about the reality of ritual murders. I think, as a priest he is able to talk with peasants and to convince them. As a scientist, who defended a thesis about this question, he will give props to the court and prosecution, though nothing can be guessed in advance yet. I became acquainted with Pranaitis and am firmly convinced that he is the person who knows the problem, about which he will talk, in depth... Everything, then, will depend on which arguments priest Pranaitis will furnish, and he has them, and they&#x27;re shattering for the Jewry.&quot;

Pranaitis&#x27; credibility rapidly dissipated when the defense demonstrated his ignorance of basic Talmudic concepts and definitions, such as hullin, to the point where &quot;many in the audience occasionally laughed out loud when he clearly became confused and couldn&#x27;t even intelligibly answer some of the questions asked by my lawyer.&quot; A Tsarist secret police agent is quoted, reporting on Pranaitis&#x27; testimony, as saying:

:&quot;Cross-examination of Pranaitis has weakened evidentiary value of his expert opinion, exposing lack of knowledge of texts, insufficient knowledge of Jewish literature. Because of amateurish knowledge and lack of resourcefulness, Pranaitis&#x27; expert opinion is of very low value. Professors Troitskij and Kokovtsev, who were interrogated today, gave conclusions which are exceptionally positive for the defence, praising doctrines of the Jewish religion, and not accepting even a possibility of a religious murder by Jews ... Vipper thinks that acquittal is possible.&quot;

===Defense===
A Beilis Defense Committee advisor, a writer named Ben-Zion Katz, suggested countering Father Pranaitis with questions like &quot;When did &quot;Baba Bathra&quot; live and what was her activity&quot; which he described as the equivalent of asking an American &quot;Who lived at the Gettysburg Address?&quot;, a ploy that invites a purported expert witness unfamiliar with the subject matter to wrongly assume a word is used in one sense where it is in fact used in another, demonstrating the ignorance of the witness for the audience. In the Gettysburg example, an informed person will immediately recognise the term &#x27;Gettysburg Address&#x27; refers to a speech (address) and not to a location (address). There were enough Jews in the court for the resultant laughter to negate Pranaitis&#x27; value to the prosecution.

Beilis was represented by the most able attorneys of the Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kiev bars: Vasily Maklakov, Oscar Gruzenberg, N. Karabchevsky, A. Zarudny, and D. Grigorovitch-Barsky. Two prominent Russian professors, Troitsky and Kokovtzov, spoke on behalf of the defense in praise of Jewish values and exposed the falsehood of the accusations, while Aleksandr Glagolev, philosopher and professor of the Kiev Theological Academy of the Orthodox Christian, affirmed that &quot;the Law of Moses forbids spilling human blood and using any blood in general in food.&quot; The well-known and respected Rabbi of Moscow, Rabbi Yaakov Mazeh, delivered a long, detailed speech quoting passages from the Torah, the Talmud and many other books to conclusively debunk the testimony of the &quot;experts&quot; brought forth by the prosecution.

===Case summary===
The lamplighter on whose testimony the indictment of Beilis rested confessed that he had been confused by the secret police.

The prosecution&#x27;s case was further undermined after it had spent a great deal of effort to link the 13 wounds which Professor Sikorsky had discovered on a part of the murdered boy&#x27;s body with the importance of the number thirteen in &quot;Jewish ritual,&quot; only to have it revealed later that there were actually 14 wounds on that part of the body.

The chief prosecutor A.I. Vipper made supposedly antisemitic statements in his closing address. There are conflicting accounts of the twelve Christian jurors: seven were members of the notorious Union of the Russian People, part of the movement known as the Black Hundreds. There was no representative of the intelligentsia in the jury. However, after deliberating for several hours, the jury acquitted Beilis.

==After the trial==

The Beilis trial was followed worldwide and the antisemitic policies of the Russian Empire were severely criticized. The Arabic newspaper &quot;Filastin&quot; published in Jaffa, Palestine, dealt with this trial in several articles. Its editor, Yousef El-Issa, published an editorial titled: &quot;The Disgrace of the Twentieth Century&quot;. He wrote on 13 October 1913:

The Beilis case was compared with the Leo Frank case, in which an American Jew, manager of a pencil factory in Atlanta, Georgia, was convicted of raping and murdering 13-year-old Mary Phagan. Leo Frank was lynched after his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.

After his acquittal, Beilis became a celebrity. One indication of the extent of his fame is the following quote: &quot;Anyone wanting to see the major stars of New York&#x27;s Yiddish stage on Thanksgiving weekend in 1913 had three choices: &quot;Mendel Beilis&quot; at Jacob Adler&#x27;s Dewey Theater, &quot;Mendel Beilis&quot; at Boris Thomashefsky&#x27;s National Theater, or &quot;Mendel Beilis&quot; at David Kessler&#x27;s Second Avenue Theater.” The violinist Jacob Gegna also composed a piece in his honor, , which he recorded in 1921.

Due to his great fame, Beilis could have become wealthy through commercial appearances. Spurning all such offers, he and his family left Russia for a farm purchased by Baron Rothschild in Palestine, then a province of the Ottoman Empire.

Beilis had difficulty making ends meet but he resisted leaving. When friends and well-wishers pleaded with him to go to America, he would respond: “Before, in Russia, when the word ‘Palestine’ conjured up a waste and barren land, even then I chose to come here in preference to other countries. How much more, then, would I insist on staying here, after I have come to love the land!”

During the Russian Civil War, the Beilis trial was reopened by the Bolsheviks former Minister of Justice Ivan Shcheglovitov, who had the case investigated as a ritual murder, was shot after a short trial in September 1918. Vera Cheberyak, the presumed actual killer, was shot in March/April 1919, as was one of her alleged accomplices, Pyotr Singaevsky. After his identity was discovered, former prosecutor A.I. Vipper, who had been working for the Bolsheviks, was arrested and sent to a gulag. He died in prison.

===United States===
When Beilis&#x27;s financial situation became desperate, he finally gave in. In 1921 he settled in the United States where in 1925 he self-published an account of his experiences titled &quot;The Story of My Sufferings&quot;. Originally published in Yiddish (1925 and 1931 editions), the book was later translated into English (1926, 1992, and 2011 editions), and also Russian.
Beilis died unexpectedly at a hotel in Saratoga Springs, New York on July 7, 1934 and was buried two days later at the Mount Carmel Cemetery, Glendale, Queens, which is the burial place of Leo Frank and Sholem Aleichem. Though Beilis&#x27;s fame had faded since the trial in 1913, it returned briefly at his death. His funeral was attended by over 4,000 people. The &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that Beilis&#x27;s fellow Jews “always believed that his conduct [in resisting all pressure to implicate himself or other Jews] saved his countrymen from a pogrom.” A history of the Eldridge Street Synagogue, where Beilis&#x27;s funeral was held, describes the scene at his funeral as follows: “The crowd could not be contained in the sanctuary. As many as a dozen policemen failed to establish order in the streets.”

Around six months before his death, Beilis was interviewed by the English-language &quot;Jewish Daily Bulletin&quot;. Asked for “one outstanding impression” of the trial in Kiev, he paid a final tribute to the Russian Gentiles who had helped him to escape the blood libel, such as the detective (Nikolai Krasovsky) and the journalist Brazul-Brushkovsky: “There was real heroism, real sacrifice. They knew that by defending me their careers would be ruined, even their very lives would not be safe. But they persisted because they knew I was innocent.”

==Depiction in &quot;The Fixer&quot;==
While Bernard Malamud&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fixer&quot; is based on the life of Mendel Beilis, Malamud transformed Beilis’ character, and that of his wife, in ways that Beilis&#x27;s descendants found degrading. The real Mendel Beilis was “a dignified, respectful, well-liked, fairly religious family man with a faithful wife, Esther, and five children.” Malamud&#x27;s protagonist Yakov Bok is “an angry, foul-mouthed, cuckolded, friendless, childless blasphemer.”

When &quot;The Fixer&quot; was first published, Beilis’ son David Beilis wrote to Malamud, complaining both that Malamud had plagiarized from Beilis’ memoirs and that Malamud had debased the memories of Beilis and his wife through the characters of Yakov Bok and Bok&#x27;s wife Raisl. Malamud wrote back, attempting to reassure David Beilis that &quot;The Fixer&quot; “makes no attempt to portray Mendel Beilis or his wife. Yakov and Raisl Bok, I am sure you will agree, in no way resemble your parents.”

The historian Albert Lindemann lamented: “By the late twentieth century, memory of the Beilis case came to be inextricably fused (and confused) with... &quot;The Fixer&quot;.”

<doc id="543630" wikidata="Q1699688" url="?curid=543630" title="John Crosbie">
<text>John Carnell Crosbie (January 30, 1931 – January 10, 2020) was a Canadian provincial and federal politician who served as the 12th lieutenant governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Prior to being lieutenant governor, he served as a provincial cabinet minister under Premiers Joey Smallwood and Frank Moores as well as a federal cabinet minister during the Progressive Conservative (PC) governments of Joe Clark and Brian Mulroney. Crosbie held several federal cabinet posts, including minister of finance, minister of justice, minister of transport, minister of international trade, and minister of fisheries and oceans.

Crosbie was best known for his outspoken, blunt, and controversial rhetoric. However, at the same time he was seen as a leader of the social liberal wing of the PC Party. He advocated for gay and lesbian rights and was pro-choice regarding abortion as far back as when he was federal Minister of Justice.

Crosbie ran unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1969, losing to Smallwood, and was also a candidate in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s 1983 leadership election, placing third.

==Early life==
Born in pre-Confederation St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, he was the son of Jessie (Carnell) and Chesley Crosbie, and the grandson of Sir John Chalker Crosbie, the latter two were both prominent businessmen. His father was leader of the Economic Union Party in the 1940s and a leading opponent of the campaign for Newfoundland to join Canadian Confederation.

Crosbie&#x27;s early education was in local schools and at St. Andrew&#x27;s College, Aurora, Ontario. He went on to study political science and economics at Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, Ontario, where he graduated with first-class honours and won the University Medal in political science.

Crosbie went on to study law at Dalhousie Law School in Halifax, Nova Scotia graduating in 1956 as the University Medalist in Law. He was awarded the Viscount Bennett Scholarship by the Canadian Bar Association as the outstanding law student for that year. He undertook postgraduate studies at the Institute for Advanced Legal Studies of the University of London and the London School of Economics in 1956-1957, and was called to the Newfoundland Bar in 1957. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws Degree by Dalhousie University in May 1984.

==Local and provincial political career==
Crosbie first entered politics as a councillor of the St. John&#x27;s City Council in 1965, and was briefly deputy mayor in 1966. He served on council until he was appointed to the provincial cabinet of Liberal Premier Joey Smallwood in 1966. Crosbie was sworn in as Minister of Municipal and Housing, and soon after won a seat in the House of Assembly. As Minister he was responsible for the creation of the Newfoundland and Labrador Housing Corporation.

In 1967, Crosbie became Minister of Health and was instrumental in creating the Newfoundland Medicare Commission and the framework for the Newfoundland Medicare Plan. Smallwood&#x27;s government had been in power since 1949, and the Premier was trying to rejuvenate his cabinet by bringing in new blood. Smallwood&#x27;s authoritarian style and refusal to allow a younger generation to take power frustrated Crosbie and other young ministers, such as Clyde Wells. In protest of a deal Smallwood wanted to make with American industrialist John Shaheen over an oil refinery at Come By Chance, Crosbie and Wells resigned from the caucus to sit as Reform Liberals, while remaining members of the Liberal Party.

In 1969, Smallwood announced his retirement from politics. However, when Crosbie, who had resigned from caucus, became the apparent front runner to succeed him as leader Smallwood decided to run for the leadership of the party. Smallwood won the leadership race and Crosbie crossed the floor to join the opposition Progressive Conservative Party, led by Frank Moores.

The Progressive Conservatives were now seen as a viable alternative to the Liberal Party, and in 1972 Crosbie helped the Tories defeat Smallwood and come to power. In Moore&#x27;s government Crosbie held the portfolios of Minister of Finance, President of the Treasury Board, and Minister of Economic Development; Minister of Fisheries and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs; Minister of Mines and Energy; and Government House Leader. He left provincial politics in 1976 to enter federal politics.

==Federal political career==
Crosbie won the seat of St. John&#x27;s West in the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election on October 18, 1976 as a candidate for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, which was in Opposition at the time.

===Finance Minister under Clark===
When Joe Clark&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government after the 1979 general election, Crosbie was appointed Minister of Finance. He presented a tough budget that included tax increases in what Crosbie quipped was &quot;short term pain for long term gain.&quot; A motion of no confidence on the budget brought the Clark government down on December 13, 1979, resulting in a new election which the Tories lost. Clark&#x27;s government would last a total of nine months less a day. Crosbie famously described it as: &quot;Long enough to conceive, just not long enough to deliver.&quot;

===Leadership bid===
Though a leadership convention was not called following their defeat at the polls, Crosbie felt that a convention would be held in the near future. In 1981, he quietly organized a team for his prospective leadership bid, while making sure not to undermine Clark&#x27;s leadership. At a leadership review held at the party&#x27;s general meeting, in Winnipeg, in 1983, 66.9% of delegates voted against holding a leadership convention. Clark felt however that this was not a strong mandate and recommended that the party executive hold a leadership convention at the earliest possible time, in which he would be a candidate.

A leadership convention was called for later that year, and Crosbie announced his candidacy. At the convention he placed third behind Brian Mulroney and Clark on all three ballots. While Crosbie may have been the most popular of the candidates, he was hurt by his inability to speak French. His response that he did not know how to speak Chinese either was not well received. Less notable was the failure of the &quot;John Crosbie blimp&quot; to operate properly during his campaign&#x27;s demonstration on the floor of the convention.

===Mulroney cabinet===
Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau retired as his party&#x27;s leader in 1984 and was replaced by John Turner. Mulroney subsequently defeated Turner by leading the Tories to power in the 1984 federal election. Crosbie was named Minister of Justice in Mulroney&#x27;s first cabinet. In 1985, while justice minister, he attracted attention when, in a heated moment during parliamentary debate, he told Liberal Member of Parliament Sheila Copps &quot;Just quiet down, baby,&quot; prompting Copps to respond, &quot;I&#x27;m nobody&#x27;s baby.&quot;

In 1986, he was named Minister of Transport. A lifelong supporter of free trade with the United States, in cabinet he was one of the strongest proponents of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. He became Minister for International Trade in 1988, shortly after the free trade agreement was negotiated. Crosbie actively promoted the agreement in that year&#x27;s federal election, which was primarily fought on the issue. Crosbie was also a supporter of redress for Japanese Canadians interned during World War Two - in September 1988 the Mulroney government made its historic apology in the House of Commons and compensated each surviving internee with $18,000.

In 1990, Crosbie proposed the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Crosbie was proud of his baby; in his autobiography he writes:
At a fundraising dinner in Victoria, British Columbia in 1990, Crosbie took another dig at Sheila Copps by saying that she made him think of the song lyrics, &quot;Pass the Tequila, Sheila, and lay down and love me again,&quot; a comment he subsequently acknowledged was ill-considered. He would later again rankle feminists and progressives with his recurring references, in the late 1980s and early 1990s (during the 34th Canadian Parliament), to the &quot;Four Horsewomen of the Apocalypse&quot;, in reference to Copps, fellow MPs Dawn Black, Mary Clancy, and National Action Committee on the Status of Women President Judy Rebick.

He later said he and Copps played up their squabbles for mutual gain. “She&#x27;s a professional politician, and I was as well,” he said in 2011. “We&#x27;re good pals now. We&#x27;re very friendly, and she&#x27;s married to a Newfoundlander, so she&#x27;s a fine woman as far as I&#x27;m concerned.” After Crosbie&#x27;s death was announced, Copps called Crosbie &quot;a great Canadian&quot;, writing that &quot;His contributions to the province and the country he loved will be long remembered.&quot;

In contrast to his often politically incorrect comments, Crosbie was often a social liberal in practice. He was pro-abortion on the issue of abortion and as Minister of Justice, liberalized divorce laws, and appointed a larger percentage of women to the bench than his predecessors. He was also an early advocate of gay and lesbian rights, changing government policy to prohibit discrimination against homosexuals in hiring in the public sector, including the military and the RCMP, and in 1986 introduced amendments to the Canadian Human Rights Code to include sexual orientation as a prohibited grounds of discrimination. He was forced to withdraw the legislation due to the opposition of the Conservative caucus. In the 1988 federal election when Newfoundland Conservatives opposed the candidacy of Ross Reid due to his refusal to deny rumours that he was gay, Crosbie angrily told a meeting of party workers &quot;I don&#x27;t care if he is having sexual relations with effing cats. He&#x27;s a fine man and he&#x27;s our candidate...I&#x27;m supporting Ross 100 per cent.

Crosbie&#x27;s final cabinet post in the Mulroney government was Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. On July 1, 1992 Crosbie visited Bay Bulls, Newfoundland and Labrador to celebrate Canada Day. Crosbie was greeted by an angry throng of Newfoundlanders concerned about rumours of a proposed moratorium on the Atlantic northwest cod fishery. He famously yelled out, &quot;I didn&#x27;t take the fish from the goddamn water, so don&#x27;t go abusing me.&quot;

He oversaw the decision to close the cod fishery industry in Atlantic Canada due to the collapse of cod stocks. Crosbie called this decision, which put some 35,000 Newfoundlanders out of work, the hardest political moment of his life.

When Brian Mulroney announced his resignation as party leader, Crosbie did not stand as a candidate at the 1993 Progressive Conservative leadership convention but supported Jean Charest&#x27;s candidacy instead. He declined an offer to serve in the cabinet of Mulroney&#x27;s successor, Kim Campbell, when she became prime minister and did not run for re-election in the 1993 federal election, retiring from federal politics.

==Life after politics==
In 1997, he published his memoirs, entitled &quot;No Holds Barred: My Life in Politics&quot; (). Around this time, the feud between him and Copps had also cooled. Crosbie had devoted an entire chapter in his autobiography to his confrontations with Copps. In her second autobiography, &quot;Worth Fighting For&quot;, Copps had Crosbie write an introduction in which he says &quot;I write this Introduction to her new book as a tribute to a feisty, sometimes ferocious, feminist protagonist, never shy or retiring but redoubtable political personality. She was a constant thorn in my side while she was in Opposition, but her marriage to my fellow Newfoundlander Austin Thorne has made her more serene and has calmed her sometimes volcanic and partisan excesses&quot;.

Crosbie remained in the Progressive Conservative Party until its dissolution in 2003. Despite his earlier opposition to the Canadian Alliance, he did not oppose the merger of the two parties and joined the new Conservative Party of Canada. In 2004, he served as an advisor to Tony Clement&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign for the leadership of the new party. In the 2004 federal election, he publicly considered running for the Conservatives against Liberal incumbent John Efford in the Newfoundland riding of Avalon, but ultimately decided against doing so.

From 1994 until 2008, he served as Chancellor of Memorial University of Newfoundland. In 1998, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Crosbie continued to practise law with the law firm of Cox &amp; Palmer in St. John&#x27;s until his appointment as Lieutenant Governor.

===Lieutenant governor===
On February 4, 2008, Governor General Michaëlle Jean, on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, appointed John Crosbie as Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, succeeding Edward Roberts. As lieutenant governor, Crosbie drew criticism for wearing a sealskin coat to several official events during Prince Charles&#x27; and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall&#x27;s tour of Newfoundland in November 2009 and for saying that the coat was a statement in support of the annual seal hunt. He was succeeded by Frank Fagan in 2013.

===2015 federal election===
John&#x27;s son, Ches Crosbie, was rejected as a federal Conservative Party of Canada candidate in the 2015 Canadian federal election, the party citing his performance in a play held by a local bar association that touched on the Canadian senate scandal. John Crosbie then accused the federal Conservatives of squashing his son&#x27;s candidacy because he was too independent and because Newfoundland senator David Wells wanted to keep his control over Newfoundland patronage appointments, an accusation that Wells denied.

===Personal life and death===
Crosbie married Jane Ellen Furneaux on September 8, 1952, and they remained married for the rest of his life. His eldest son, Ches Crosbie, is a lawyer and former politician. Ches was elected leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador on April 28, 2018 serving until March 31, 2021. His younger son, Michael Crosbie, is a lawyer with McInnis Cooper in St. John&#x27;s. His daughter, Beth Crosbie, is a former real estate agent, and was a candidate in the 2015 and 2019 provincial elections.

Crosbie died in St. John&#x27;s on January 10, 2020, after a period of declining health. Former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney eulogized him in glowing terms at his state funeral:

==Memorable quotations==

* &quot;Why are you yelling at me? I didn&#x27;t take the fish from the God damn water, so don&#x27;t go abusing me.&quot;
*&quot;They don&#x27;t need to go berserk. Trying to batter on doors to frighten me. In the first place, I don&#x27;t frighten.&quot; (Referring to protesters outside of his press conference on the Cod moratorium.)
* &quot;Americans were far more popular in Newfoundland than Canadians, so I was never hung up about the United States. There&#x27;s always seemed to be a hang up with the Toronto cultural literati about the US. But that&#x27;s never been the feeling in Newfoundland and Atlantic Canada.&quot;
* &quot;Someday we&#x27;re going to have a North American continent that&#x27;s an economic union. That&#x27;s inevitable. These economic forces are there, and government policy can&#x27;t stop them. It&#x27;s only a question of, How do you get into a more secure position? They&#x27;re next door and geography dictates. Like it or not, we&#x27;re going up or down with the US.&quot;
* &quot;No, and I&#x27;m goddamned not going to either! I&#x27;ll tell you that, and I&#x27;m telling you that there isn&#x27;t one person in the whole goddamn government who&#x27;s read it. I&#x27;m the only one honest enough to say so ... At this stage of my life I don&#x27;t have to kiss anybody&#x27;s ass, I can say what I goddamn well like.&quot; (On reading the 1987 Free-Trade Agreement)
*&quot;It is better to be honest and sincere in one language than a twister, a trickster and a twit in two.&quot; (referring to his own unilingualism and Trudeau&#x27;s bilingualism)
*&quot;No, I don&#x27;t speak Mandarin Chinese either.&quot; (his response when asked if not speaking French would hinder his ability to be Prime Minister)
*&quot;The Canadian economy needs a transfusion and who do they give us, Dracula.&quot; (reference to the appointment of Marc Lalonde as Canada&#x27;s new Finance Minister, 1982)
*&quot;The Hon. leader of the Opposition knows all about butts. He has had his hands on more butts than there are members of this House.&quot; (to Turner&#x27;s 1984 election campaign gaffe on TV when he was caught slapping Liberal MP&#x27;s Iona Campagnolo&#x27;s buttocks.)

<doc id="543637" wikidata="Q1050762" url="?curid=543637" title="Women and Children First">
<text>Women and Children First is the third studio album by American rock band Van Halen, released on March 26, 1980, on Warner Bros. Records. Produced by Ted Templeman and engineered by Donn Landee, it was the first Van Halen album not to feature any cover songs, and is described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as &quot;[the] record where the group started to get heavier, both sonically and, to a lesser extent, thematically.&quot;

==Background and recording==
The opening track, &quot;And the Cradle Will Rock...&quot; begins with what sounds like a guitar, but is actually a phase shifter-effected Wurlitzer electric piano played through Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s 1960s model 100-watt Marshall &quot;Plexi&quot; amplifier.

Like the two preceding albums, &quot;Women and Children First&quot; was recorded in Hollywood at Sunset Studios, within about two weeks. The album features more studio overdubs and less emphasis on backing vocals, partly because two of the songs, &quot;In a Simple Rhyme&quot; and &quot;Take Your Whiskey Home&quot;, had already been written and recorded in a 1974 Cherokee Studios demo, before Michael Anthony had joined them, albeit both with some differences lyrically and musically. Two other songs had also been played live earlier: &quot;Fools&quot; as early as 1975, while &quot;Loss of Control&quot; debuted in 1977.

&quot;Could This Be Magic?&quot; contains the only female backing vocal ever recorded for a Van Halen song; Nicolette Larson sings during some of the choruses. The rain sound in the background is not an effect; it was raining outside, and the band decided to record the sound in stereo using two Neumann KM84 microphones, and added it to the track.

The album contains a track at the end of &quot;In a Simple Rhyme,&quot; a brief instrumental piece entitled &quot;Growth,&quot; beginning at 4:19. While &quot;Growth&quot; faded out on the original vinyl LP and cassette, it was given a cold ending at full volume on the compact disc. At the time the band was considering starting what would become their next album, &quot;Fair Warning&quot;, with a continuation of &quot;Growth,&quot; but did not. &quot;Growth&quot; was a staple of the band&#x27;s live shows with Roth and often used as the start of their encores.

Several outtakes from these sessions exist, including an unreleased instrumental often referred to as &quot;Act Like It Hurts,&quot; which was the title Eddie Van Halen originally wanted for &quot;Tora! Tora!&quot;. &quot;Act Like It Hurts&quot; was also the source of a riff used for &quot;House of Pain,&quot; released on &quot;1984&quot;.

The first single from the album was the keyboard-driven &quot;And the Cradle Will Rock...&quot; Although the single was not as successful as previous release &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; or the cover of &quot;You Really Got Me,&quot; the album itself was well-received, went platinum within a year and further entrenched the band as a popular concert draw. The song &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot; was also a concert staple through the 1984 tour, and continued to be played by David Lee Roth after he left Van Halen.

The vinyl LP version included a poster of a photograph by Helmut Newton featuring Roth chained to a fence.

==Critical reception==

Reviews for &quot;Women and Children First&quot; were generally favorable. David Fricke for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; highlights the songs, &quot;Romeo Delight&quot;, &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot;, and &quot;Loss of Control&quot;, calling them &quot;works of high-volume art&quot;. Fricke praises the band, calling them &quot;exceptionally good players&quot;. Both Fricke and Robert Christgau compare Eddie&#x27;s guitar work to Jimi Hendrix. Christgau gives the album a B rating, stating, &quot;[Eddie] earns the Hendrix comparisons, and he&#x27;s no clone—he&#x27;s faster, colder, more structural.&quot; In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album 4.5 stars out of 5. Erlewine calls the album, &quot;mature, or at least... a little serious&quot;, noting &quot;there&#x27;s a bit of a dark heart beating on this record&quot;.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine listed the album at number 30 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the album at number 36 in their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

<text>The term property ladder—or housing ladder—, widely used in the United Kingdom, describes the relative differences in constant terms from cheaper to more expensive housing.

According to this metaphor, an individual or a family can progress by stages from starter homes (for younger first-time buyers who are typically at the bottom of the property ladder) to move-up houses to more expensive houses that are at the top. &quot;Getting on to the property ladder&quot; is the process of buying one&#x27;s first house and holding a place on the property market.

The Oxford English Dictionary traces use of the phrase &quot;property ladder&quot; back to 1941 in the journal &quot;Eugenics&quot;.

<text>Landmark College is a private college in Putney, Vermont, designed exclusively for students who learn differently, including those with a learning disability (such as dyslexia), ADHD, autism or executive function challenges. It was established in 1985 and was the first institution of higher learning to pioneer college-level studies for students with dyslexia.

The college offers associate and bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in the liberal arts and sciences. It is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).

== History ==
The campus the college occupies originally belonged to Windham College. After Windham shuttered in 1978, the campus remained unused. Plans for a prison and a conference center fell through. Putney Selectman Peter Shumlin persuaded the government to allow Landmark School in Beverly, Massachusetts, to start a college on the dormant campus. Landmark College was established in 1985.

Lynda Katz was appointed as the college&#x27;s 3rd president in 1994. Dr. Katz came in with goal of expanding and renovating the campus, implementing a faculty rank &amp; promotion system as well as increased salaries, and pinning the college on the map as a contributor to the state.

The newly renovated Strauch Family Student Center was opened in 1997, which houses Student Affairs offices, Health &amp; Counseling, the campus bookstore, student mail, the Fireside Cafe, and game room.

From 1999-2000, Landmark College received a Title III grant which improved the college&#x27;s academic and residential programs, and a Title VII from the US Department of Education, which allowed Landmark College to share their expertise on learning disability &amp; ADHD nationwide.

On May 17th, 2001, the Chris Family Click Center (or &quot;Click Center&quot; for short) opened with expanded recreation and exercise facilities, including a climbing wall, replacing the original &quot;bubble&quot; that previously occupied the space.

In early 2004, the Landmark College Board of Trustees approved 3 capital projects, which included the East Academic Building (now Lewis Academic Building), Dining Hall (now Alumni Dining Hall), and the Bridges suite-style residences. 

Following Dr. Katz&#x27;s retirement in 2011, Peter A. Eden was named as the college&#x27;s 4th president on July 1st the same year. Dr. Eden came in with a biotechnology and science background, which pushed for new degree programs in the sciences, including the first bachelor degree programs. 

Landmark began offering its first bachelor degree in 2012, a Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies. Associates degrees in Computer Science and Life Science were also offered the same year.

The college built a $9.6 million, 28,500-square-foot science and technology center named the MacFarlane Building in 2015. It was the first building erected since the college&#x27;s founding.

In September of 2016, Landmark College received a grant from the National Science Foundation of $650K. The &quot;Access to Innovative Education: STEM Opportunities for Students with Learning Disabilities&quot; (AIE-STEM) supports student scholar in its Computer Science and Life Science (now Biology) programs. Students in the program were offered scholarships up to $10K, and receive mentoring and internship opportunities.

On July 13, 2024, Jim Dlugos was named as interim president after Peter Eden&#x27;s departure. A permanent president is expected to be named in 2025.

== Academics ==

Applicants to the college are required to document average to above-average intelligence with the ability to complete college level work, along with a condition that impairs learning. Students are offered personal assistance in their studies, with a student-to-faculty ratio is 6:1, and a center for academic support employed with professional academic staff. Classroom faculty employ universal design principles and multi-modal teaching strategies.

The college offers associate degrees and, since 2012, has offered bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Additionally, a post-baccalaureate certificate in Learning Differences and Neurodiversity aimed at education professionals was introduced in 2018.

High school students in several areas of Landmark&#x27;s county, Windham, can access dual-enrollment NEASC-accredited courses. Middle school students can participate in a summer program called &quot;Expanded Learning Opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that 30% of students in the associate program graduated within three years; many dropped out in their first or second semester.

=== High School Summer Program ===
The three-week-long High School Program is intended to assist high school students entering their junior or senior year. The program is designed to help students who may be struggling in school to learn about their learning styles, develop good habits &amp; study skills, and serve as an introduction to college level academics. Students must be between 16-18 years old in order to be eligible for the program.

The program also has a Social Pragmatics track, where for an additional fee, students receive instruction in the PEERS® curriculum for students struggling with making and keeping social connections. Students also have regular 1:1 sessions with a social coach.

== Costs ==
Tuition and fees for 2022–23 were $76,680, making it the 50th most expensive college, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Tuition and fees for the 2015–2016 year were $51,330. In 2015, it topped CNN Money&#x27;s list of the most expensive colleges. It was also the most expensive four-year private non-profit by list price according to the Department of Education&#x27;s rankings for the 2012–2013 year; fees including room and board were reported to be $59,930 in 2013 and $61,910 in 2015. Scholarships of up to $30,000 are available.

== Student life ==
The average age is 20 years old, and about 97% of students live on campus. The male-to-female student ratio is about 3:1. Students are not required to have taken the SAT or ACT examinations. About half of Landmark&#x27;s full-time students transferred from another college. Student turnover is high; there are now several bachelor&#x27;s degrees offered, including Biology, Computer Science, Liberal Studies, Psychology, Integrated Arts, and Communications &amp; Entrepreneurial Leadership (aka. COMEL) at the bachelors level. Associates Degree offerings include Business Studies, General Studies, Liberal Studies, Computer Science, and Biology.

== Facilities ==
Rooms are either doubles or singles. Residential halls are equipped with wireless Internet, laundry facilities, and common lounge space, as well as full-time residential staff. Some suite buildings have kitchens.

=== Standard Housing ===
The four standard residence halls include Frost Hall, Alumni Hall (formerly Middle Hall), Stone Hall (formerly Hall 4), and Davis Hall, each can hold 55-75 students. Most students in their first year (and those who have not transferred from another college/university) will be placed in one of the four traditional buildings. Double-occupancy rooms make up a majority of the rooms in these buildings (with a handful of single-occupancy rooms)

=== Premium Housing ===
Upperclass students can choose to live in premium housing options, including Aiken Hall, the Bridges, or Chumley. Bridges and Chumley offer suite/apartment style living with a common space, bathroom, and kitchenette for cooking including a stove, oven &amp; microwave.

== Media ==
Media produced at the college include &quot;Impressions&quot; literary magazine, &quot;Voices Magazine&quot; student newspaper (formerly &quot;The Independent&quot;), WLMC Radio, and &quot;LC Voices&quot;.

=== WLMC Radio ===
WLMC Radio is the online streaming student-run radio station of Landmark College, broadcasting 24/7. The station has a regular cast of live DJs who are mostly students, but faculty and staff can also have shows.

<text>Sholom Dovber Schneersohn () was the fifth rebbe (spiritual leader) of the Chabad-Lubavitch chasidic movement. He is known as &quot;the Rebbe Rashab&quot; (for Reb Sholom Ber). His teachings that encouraged outreach were further developed later.

== Life ==
===Early life===
Schneersohn was born in Lubavitch, on 20 Cheshvan 5621 (5 November, 1860), the second son of Shmuel Schneersohn, the fourth Chabad &quot;Rebbe&quot;. In 1882, when his father died, he was not quite 22 years old, and his brother Reb Zalman Aharon was not much older. A period followed, during which both brothers fulfilled some of the tasks of a rebbe, but neither felt ready to take on the title and responsibilities. Over this period he gradually took on more responsibilities, particularly in dealing with the impact of the May Laws regarding the Jews, and on Rosh Hashanah 5643 (10 September 1892 OS) he accepted the leadership of the Lubavitch movement.

Schneersohn married his cousin, Shterna Sara Schneersohn. She was the daughter of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn of Avorutch, a son of the Tzemach Tzedek. They had one son whom they named Yosef Yitzchok after Shterna Sara&#x27;s father. Yosef Yitzchok later succeeded his father as Rebbe

=== Later life ===
In 1916, as the fighting in World War I neared Lubavitch, Schneersohn was deported to Rostov-on-Don. As Bolshevik forces approached Rostov he considered moving to Palestine, which was part of the Ottoman Empire at the time, and prepared all the necessary paperwork; his only extant picture comes from his Turkish visa since he usually refused to be photographed. But eventually, he decided to stay in Rostov, where he died on 21 March 1920 (2 Nisan 5680).

During the construction of the &quot;Rostov Palace of Sport&quot; on top of the Old Jewish Cemetery in 1940, his remains were secretly moved by a religious group of Chassidim to a different burial site where they are located to this day in the &quot;Rostov Jewish Cemetery.&quot; His grave is visited daily by followers of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement, who come from all over the world.

== Leadership ==

Schneersohn established the first Chabad yeshiva, Tomchei Temimim, in 1897. In 1911 he established another yeshivah, Toras Emes, in Israel, and in 1916 he established a yeshivah in Georgia. Avrum Erlich has argued that it was these institutions that made Lubavitch the dominant of the various Chabad Hasidic movements.

He maintained a lengthy correspondence, not only with Chabad Chasidim in other countries, but also with non-Chabad chasidim and members of other groups who wrote to him for advice. He also met with other Jewish and Hasidic leaders, working with them on issues such as education, unity, policy, and strategy. He was held in high esteem by the Chofetz Chaim, so much so that the Chofetz Chaim declared of him, &quot;the words of the [Lubavitcher] Rebbe are holy, and anyone who argues [or] disagrees with him [should know that] it is as if he is disagreeing with Moses.&quot;

Schneersohn promoted Jewish agricultural settlement, and the creation of employment for Jews, particularly those displaced by the May Laws. 

He was a prominent opponent of Zionism, both in its secular and religious versions and a staunch ally of Reb Chaim Brisker. In 1903 he published &quot;Kuntres Uma&#x27;ayan&quot;, which contained a strong polemic against Zionism. He was deeply concerned that secular nationalism would replace Judaism as the foundation of Jewish identity. Together with Reb Chaim he joined and supported Machazikei Hadas - a union of Eastern European haredim and the forerunner of the Agudah - but in 1912, when the Agudah was formed in Katowice, Reb Chaim raised 18 objections to its constitution, and Schneersohn kept Lubavitch out of the Agudah.

After the February Revolution, elections were called for Jewish city councils and a General Jewish Assembly. Schneersohn worked tirelessly to organize a religious front with a center and a special office to deal with it all. For this reason, he called a unique conference of all the Torah giants throughout Russia. This conference was held in 1917 in Moscow, and was preceded by a meeting of the leading Rabbis, to decide the matters to be discussed there. This smaller meeting was held in Petrograd. However, because the participants in this meeting were few and in a hurry to return home, the Moscow conference failed to yield proper results. Thus, it was necessary to convene once again in Kharkiv in 1918, to discuss the elections for the General Jewish Assembly.

His worries about the Mountain Jews led him to send a famous &quot;Mashpia&quot;, Rabbi Shmuel Levitin of Rakshik, to the Caucasus to set up institutions to bring them closer to Orthodox observance, setting a precedent for his two successors, who conducted similar activities.

Notable disciples of Schneersohn include R. Levi Yitzchak Schneerson, R. Itche Der Masmid, and R. Zalman Moishe HaYitzchaki. The Malach.

== Published works ==

Schneersohn was a prolific writer on Chabad theology. Much of his work has been published in Hebrew, and some of it has been translated into English and is available online.
* &quot;Sefer HaMa&#x27;amarim&quot; - a 31-volume set of Chasidic discourses, according to the years set. The most important of these include two three-year-long cycle of discourses beginning &quot;Yom Tov Shel Rosh Hashanah 5666&quot; (&quot;Samech-Vov&quot;) and &quot;B&#x27;shaah Shehikdimu 5672 (Ayin-Beis)&quot;. They serve today as major in-depth encyclopedic introductory works into &quot;oral&quot; Chabad Chassidism (as opposed to the &quot;written&quot; one, i.e., Tanya) studied in Chabad yeshivas.
* &quot;Igros Kodesh&quot; - six volume set of letters
* &quot;Toras Sholom&quot; - compilation of public addresses

<doc id="543667" wikidata="Q2732015" url="?curid=543667" title="Flood geology">
<text>Flood geology (also creation geology or diluvial geology) is a pseudoscientific attempt to interpret and reconcile geological features of the Earth in accordance with a literal belief in the Genesis flood narrative, the flood myth in the Hebrew Bible. In the early 19th century, diluvial geologists hypothesized that specific surface features provided evidence of a worldwide flood which had followed earlier geological eras; after further investigation they agreed that these features resulted from local floods or from glaciers. In the 20th century, young-Earth creationists revived flood geology as an overarching concept in their opposition to evolution, assuming a recent six-day Creation and cataclysmic geological changes during the biblical flood, and incorporating creationist explanations of the sequences of rock strata.

In the early stages of development of the science of geology, fossils were interpreted as evidence of past flooding. The &quot;theories of the Earth&quot; of the 17th century proposed mechanisms based on natural laws, within a timescale set by the Ussher chronology. As modern geology developed, geologists found evidence of an ancient Earth and evidence inconsistent with the notion that the Earth had developed in a series of cataclysms, like the Genesis flood. In early 19th-century Britain, &quot;diluvialism&quot; attributed landforms and surface features (such as beds of gravel and erratic boulders) to the destructive effects of this supposed global deluge, but by 1830 geologists increasingly found that the evidence supported only relatively local floods. So-called scriptural geologists attempted to give primacy to literal biblical explanations, but they lacked a background in geology and were marginalised by the scientific community, as well as having little influence in the churches.

Creationist flood geology was only supported by a minority of the 20th century anti-evolution movement, mainly in the Seventh-day Adventist Church, until the 1961 publication of &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot; by Morris and Whitcomb. Around 1970, proponents adopted the terms &quot;scientific creationism&quot; and creation science.

Proponents of flood geology hold to a literal reading of and view its passages as historically accurate; they use the Bible&#x27;s internal chronology to place the Genesis flood and the story of Noah&#x27;s Ark within the last 5,000 years.

Scientific analysis has refuted the key tenets of flood geology. Flood geology contradicts the scientific consensus in geology, stratigraphy, geophysics, physics, paleontology, biology, anthropology, and archaeology. Modern geology, its sub-disciplines and other scientific disciplines use the scientific method. In contrast, flood geology does not adhere to the scientific method, making it a pseudoscience.

==History of theories==

In pre-Christian times, fossils found on land were thought by Greek philosophers—including Xenophanes, Xanthus and Aristotle—to be evidence that the sea had in past ages covered the land. Their concept of vast time periods in an eternal cosmos was rejected by early Christian writers as incompatible with their belief in Creation by God. Among the church fathers, Tertullian spoke of fossils demonstrating that mountains had been overrun by water without explicitly saying when. Chrysostom and Augustine believed that fossils were the remains of animals that were killed and buried during the brief duration of the Genesis flood, and later Martin Luther viewed fossils as having resulted from the flood. The earliest documentation of the famous fossil fishes of the Sannine Formation comes from Eusebius, who cites them as being evidence of the Biblical flood.

Other scholars, including Avicenna, thought fossils were produced in the rock by &quot;petrifying virtue&quot; acting on &quot;seeds&quot; of plants and animals. In 1580, Bernard Palissy speculated that fossils had formed in lakes, and natural historians subsequently disputed the alternatives. Robert Hooke made empirical investigations and doubted that the numbers of fossil shells or depth of shell beds could have formed in the one year of Noah&#x27;s flood. In 1616, Nicolas Steno showed how chemical processes changed organic remains into stone fossils. His fundamental principles of stratigraphy published in 1669 established that rock strata formed horizontally and were later broken and tilted, though he assumed these processes would occur within 6,000 years including a worldwide flood.

===Theories of the Earth===
In his influential &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; of 1644, René Descartes applied his mechanical physical laws to envisage swirling particles forming the Earth as a layered sphere. This natural philosophy was recast in biblical terms by the theologian Thomas Burnet, whose &quot;Sacred Theory of the Earth&quot; published in the 1680s proposed complex explanations based on natural laws, and explicitly rejected the simpler approach of invoking miracles as incompatible with the methodology of natural philosophy (the precursor to science). Burnet maintained that less than 6,000 years ago the Earth had emerged from chaos as a perfect sphere, with paradise on land over a watery abyss. This crust had dried out and cracked, and its collapse caused the biblical deluge, forming mountains as well as caverns where the water retreated. He made no mention of fossils but inspired other diluvial theories that did.

In 1695, John Woodward&#x27;s &quot;An Essay Toward a Natural History of the Earth&quot; viewed the Genesis flood as dissolving rocks and soil into a thick slurry that caught up all living things, which, when the waters settled, formed strata according to the relative density of these materials, including fossils of the organisms. When it was pointed out that lower layers were often less dense and forces that shattered rock would destroy organic remains, he resorted to the explanation that a divine miracle had temporarily suspended gravity. 

William Whiston&#x27;s &quot;New Theory of the Earth&quot; of 1696 combined scripture with Newtonian physics to propose that the original chaos was the atmosphere of a comet with the days of creation each taking a year, and the Genesis flood had resulted from a second comet. His explanation of how the flood caused mountains and the fossil sequence was similar to Woodward&#x27;s. Johann Jakob Scheuchzer wrote in support of Woodward&#x27;s ideas in 1708, describing some fossil vertebrae as bones of sinners who had perished in the flood. A skeleton found in a quarry was described by him in 1726 as &quot;Homo diluvii testis&quot;, a giant human testifying to the flood. This was accepted for some time, but in 1812 it was shown to be a prehistoric salamander.

===Beginnings of modern geology===
The modern science of geology developed in the 18th century; the term &quot;geology&quot; was popularised by the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of 1751. Steno&#x27;s categorisation of strata was expanded by several geologists, including Johann Gottlob Lehmann who believed that the oldest mountains had formed early in the Creation, and categorised as &quot;Flötz-Gebürge&quot; stratified mountains with few ore deposits but with thin layers containing fossils, overlain by a third category of superficial deposits. In his 1756 publication he identified 30 different layers in this category which he attributed to the action of the Genesis deluge, possibly including debris from the older mountains. Others including Giovanni Arduino attributed secondary strata to natural causes: Georg Christian Füchsel said that geologists had to take as standard the processes in which nature currently produces solids, &quot;we know no other way&quot;, and only the most recent deposits could be attributed to a great flood.

Lehman&#x27;s classification was developed by Abraham Gottlob Werner who thought that rock strata had been deposited from a primeval global ocean rather than by Noah&#x27;s flood, a doctrine called Neptunism. The idea of a young Earth was further undermined in 1774 by Nicolas Desmarest, whose studies of a succession of extinct volcanoes in Europe showed layers which would have taken long ages to build up. The fact that these layers were still intact indicated that any later flood had been local rather than universal. Against Neptunism, James Hutton proposed an indefinitely old cycle of eroded rocks being deposited in the sea, consolidated and heaved up by volcanic forces into mountains which in turn eroded, all in natural processes which continue to operate.

===Catastrophism and diluvialism===
The first professional geological society, the Geological Society of London, was founded in 1807. By this time, geologists were convinced that an immense time had been needed to build up the huge thickness of rock strata visible in quarries and cliffs, implying extensive pre-human periods. Most accepted a basic time scale classifying rocks as primitive, transition, secondary, or tertiary. Several researchers independently found that strata could be identified by characteristic fossils: secondary strata in southern England were mapped by William Smith from 1799 to 1815.

====Cuvier and Jameson====
Georges Cuvier, working with Alexandre Brongniart, examined tertiary strata in the region around Paris. Cuvier found that fossils identified rock formations as alternating between marine and terrestrial deposits, indicating &quot;repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea&quot; which he identified with a long series of sudden catastrophes which had caused extinctions. In his 1812 &quot;Discours préliminaire&quot; to his &quot;Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles de quadrupeds&quot; put forward a synthesis of this research into the long prehistoric period, and a historical approach to the most recent catastrophe. His historical approach tested empirical claims in the biblical text of Genesis against other ancient writings to pick out the &quot;real facts&quot; from &quot;interested fictions&quot;. In his assessment, Moses had written the account around 3,300 years ago, long after the events described. Cuvier only discussed the Genesis flood in general terms, as the most recent example of &quot;an event of an [&quot;sic&quot;] universal catastrophe, occasioned by an irruption of the waters&quot; not set &quot;much further back than five or six thousand years ago&quot;. The historical texts could be loosely related to evidence such as overturned strata and &quot;heaps of &quot;debris&quot; and rounded pebbles&quot;. An English translation was published in 1813 with a preface and notes by Robert Jameson, Regius Professor of Natural history at the University of Edinburgh. He began the preface with a sentence which ignored Cuvier&#x27;s historical approach and instead deferred to revelation:
 This sentence was removed after the second edition, and Jameson&#x27;s position changed as shown by his notes in successive editions, but it influenced British views of Cuvier&#x27;s concept. In 1819, George Bellas Greenough, first president of The Geological Society, issued &quot;A Critical Examination of the First Principles of Geology&quot; stating that unless erratic boulders deposited hundreds of miles from their original sources had been moved by seas, rivers, or collapsing lakes, &quot;the only remaining cause, to which these effects can be ascribed, is a Debacle or Deluge.&quot;

====Buckland and the English school of geologists====
Conservative geologists in Britain welcomed Cuvier&#x27;s theory to replace Werner&#x27;s Neptunism, and the Church of England clergyman William Buckland became the foremost proponent of flood geology as he sought to get the new science of geology accepted on the curriculum of the University of Oxford. In 1818, he was visited by Cuvier, and in his inaugural speech in 1819 as the first professor of geology at the university he defended the subject against allegations that it undermined religion. His speech, published as &quot;Vindiciae Geologicae; or, The Connexion of Geology with Religion Explained&quot;, equated the last of a long series of catastrophes with the Genesis flood, and said that &quot;the grand fact of an universal deluge at no very remote period is proved on grounds so decisive and incontrovertible, that, had we never heard of such an event from Scripture, or any other, authority, Geology of itself must have called in the assistance of some such catastrophe, to explain the phenomena of diluvian action which are universally presented to us, and which are unintelligible without recourse to a deluge exerting its ravages at a period not more ancient than that announced in the Book of Genesis.&quot; The evidence he proposed included erratic boulders, extensive areas of gravel, and landforms which appeared to have been scoured by water.

This inaugural address influenced the geologists William Conybeare and William Phillips. In their 1822 book on &quot;Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales&quot; Conybeare referred to the same features in an introduction about the relationship between geology and religion, describing how a deluge causing &quot;the last great geological change to which the surface of our planet appears to have been exposed&quot; left behind the debris (which he named in Latin &quot;Diluvium&quot;) as evidence for &quot;that great and universal catastrophe to which it seems most properly assignable&quot;. In 1823 Buckland published his detailed account of &quot;Relics of the Flood&quot;, &quot;Reliquiae Diluvianae;&quot; or, &quot;Observations on the Organic Remains Contained in Caves, Fissures, and Diluvial Gravel and on Other Geological Phenomena Attesting the Action of an Universal Deluge&quot;, incorporating his research suggesting that animal fossils had been dragged into the Kirkdale Cave by hyenas then covered by a layer of red mud washed in by the deluge.

Buckland&#x27;s views were supported by other Church of England clergymen naturalists: his Oxford colleague Charles Daubeny proposed in 1820 that the volcanoes of the Auvergne showed a sequence of lava flows from before and after the flood had cut valleys through the region. In an 1823 article &quot;On the deluge&quot;, John Stevens Henslow, professor of mineralogy at the University of Cambridge, affirmed the concept and proposed that the flood had originated from a comet, but this was his only comment on the topic. Adam Sedgwick, Woodwardian Professor of Geology at Cambridge, presented two supportive papers in 1825, &quot;On the origin of alluvial and diluvial deposits&quot;, and &quot;On diluvial formations&quot;. At this time, most of what Sedgwick called &quot;The English school of geologists&quot; distinguished superficial deposits which were &quot;diluvial&quot;, showing &quot;great irregular masses of sand, loam, and coarse gravel, containing through its mass rounded blocks sometimes of enormous magnitude&quot; and supposedly caused by &quot;some great irregular inundation&quot;, from &quot;alluvial&quot; deposits of &quot;comminuted gravel, silt, loam, and other materials&quot; attributed to lesser events, the &quot;propelling force&quot; of rivers, or &quot;successive partial inundations&quot;.

In America, Benjamin Silliman at Yale College spread the concept and in an 1833 essay dismissed the earlier idea that most stratified rocks had been formed in the flood, while arguing that surface features showed &quot;wreck and ruin&quot; attributable to &quot;mighty floods and rushing torrents of water&quot;. He said that &quot;we must charge to moving waters the undulating appearance of stratified sand and gravel, often observed in many places, and very conspicuously in the plain of New Haven, and in other regions of Connecticut and New England&quot;, while both &quot;bowlder stones&quot; and sandy deserts across the world could be attributed to &quot;diluvial agency&quot;.

====Criticisms and retractions: the downfall of diluvialism====
Other naturalists were critical of diluvialism: Church of Scotland minister John Fleming published opposing arguments in a series of articles from 1823 onwards. He was critical of the assumption that fossils resembling modern tropical species had been swept north &quot;by some violent means&quot;, which he regarded as absurd considering the &quot;unbroken state&quot; of fossil remains. For example, fossil mammoths demonstrated adaptation to the same northern climates now prevalent where they were found. He criticized Buckland&#x27;s identification of red mud in the Kirkdale cave as diluvial, when nearly identical mud in other caves had been described as fluvial. While Cuvier had reconciled geology with a loose reading of the biblical text, Fleming argued that such a union was &quot;indiscreet&quot; and turned to a more literal view of Genesis:
When Sedgwick visited Paris at the end of 1826 he found hostility to diluvialism: Alexander von Humboldt ridiculed it &quot;beyond measure&quot;, and Louis-Constant Prévost &quot;lectured against it&quot;. In the summer of 1827 Sedgwick and Roderick Murchison travelled to investigate the geology of the Scottish Highlands, where they found &quot;so many indications of &quot;local diluvial&quot; operations&quot; that Sedgwick began to change his mind about it being worldwide. When George Poulett Scrope published his investigations into the Auvergne in 1827, he did not use the term &quot;diluvium&quot;. He was followed by Murchison and Charles Lyell whose account appeared in 1829. All three agreed that the valleys could well have been formed by rivers acting over a long time, and a deluge was not needed. 

Lyell, formerly a pupil of Buckland, put strong arguments against diluvialism in the first volume of his &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; published in 1830, though suggesting the possibility of a deluge affecting a region such as the low-lying area around the Caspian Sea. Sedgwick responded to this book in his presidential address to the Geological Society in February 1830, agreeing that diluvial deposits had formed at differing times. At the society a year later, when retiring from the presidency, Sedgwick described his former belief that &quot;vast masses of diluvial gravel&quot; had been scattered worldwide in &quot;one violent and transitory period&quot; as &quot;a most unwarranted conclusion&quot;, and therefore thought &quot;it right, as one of my last acts before I quit this Chair, thus publicly to read my recantation.&quot; However, he remained convinced that a flood as described in Genesis was not excluded by geology.

One student had seen the gradual abandonment of diluvialism: Charles Darwin had attended Jameson&#x27;s geology lectures in 1826 and at Cambridge became a close friend of Henslow before learning geology from Sedgwick in 1831. At the outset of the &quot;Beagle&quot; voyage Darwin was given a copy of Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; and at the first landfall began his career as a geologist with investigations which supported Lyell&#x27;s concept of slow uplift while also describing loose rocks and gravel as &quot;part of the long disputed Diluvium&quot;. Debates continued over the part played by repeated exceptional catastrophes in geology, and in 1832 William Whewell dubbed this view catastrophism, while naming Lyell&#x27;s insistence on explanations based on current processes uniformitarianism.

Buckland, too, gradually modified his views on the deluge. In 1832 a student noted Buckland&#x27;s view on cause of diluvial gravel, &quot;whether is Mosaic inundation or not, will not say&quot;. In a footnote to his &quot;Bridgewater Treatise&quot; of 1836, Buckland backed down from his former claim that the &quot;violent inundation&quot; identified in his &quot;Reliquiae Diluvianae&quot; was the Genesis flood: 
For a while, Buckland had continued to insist that &quot;some&quot; geological layers were related to the Great Flood, but grew to accept the idea that they represented multiple inundations which occurred well before humans existed. In 1840 he made a field trip to Scotland with the Swiss geologist Louis Agassiz and became convinced that the &quot;diluvial&quot; features which he had attributed to the deluge had, in fact, been produced by ancient ice ages. Buckland became one of the foremost champions of Agassiz&#x27;s theory of glaciations, and diluvialism went out of use in geology. Active geologists no longer posited sudden ancient catastrophes with unknown causes and instead increasingly explained phenomena by observable processes causing slow changes over great periods.

===Scriptural geologists, and later commentary===
Scriptural geologists were a heterogeneous group of writers in the early 19th century who claimed &quot;the primacy of literalistic biblical exegesis&quot; and a short young Earth time scale. Their views were marginalised and ignored by the scientific community of their time. They generally lacked any background in geology and had little influence even in church circles.

Many of them quoted obsolete geological writings. Among the most prominent, Granville Penn argued in 1822 that &quot;mineral geology&quot; rejected revelation, while true &quot;Mosaical geology&quot; showed that God had created primitive rock formations directly, in correspondence with the laws which God then made to produce subsequent effects. A first revolution on the third day of creation deepened the oceans so water rushed in, and in the deluge 1,656 years afterwards a second revolution sank land areas and raised the sea bed to cause a swirling flood which moved soil and fossil remains into stratified layers, after which God created new vegetation. As Genesis appeared to show that the rivers of Eden had survived this catastrophe, he argued that the verses concerned were an added &quot;parenthesis&quot; which should be disregarded. In 1837 George Fairholme expressed disappointment about disappearing belief in the deluge, and about Sedgwick and Buckland recanting diluvialism while putting forward his own &quot;New and Conclusive Physical Demonstrations&quot; which ignored geological findings to claim that strata had been deposited in a quick continuous process while still moist.

Geology was popularized by several authors. John Pye Smith&#x27;s lectures published in 1840 reconciled an extended time frame with Genesis by the increasingly common gap theology or day-age theology, and said it was likely that the gravel and boulder formations were not diluvium but had taken long ages predating the creation of humans. He reaffirmed that the flood was historical as a local event, something which the 17th century theologians Edward Stillingfleet and Matthew Poole had already suggested on a purely biblical basis. Smith also denounced the &quot;fanciful&quot; writings of the scriptural geologists. Edward Hitchcock sought to ensure that geological findings could be corroborated by scripture and dismissed the scriptural geology of Penn and Fairholme as misrepresenting both scripture and the facts of geology. He noted the difficulty of equating a violent deluge with the more tranquil Genesis account. Hugh Miller supported similar points with considerable detail.

Little attention was paid to flood geology over the rest of the 19th century, its few supporters included the author Eleazar Lord in the 1850s and the Lutheran scholar Carl Friedrich Keil in 1860 and 1878. The visions of Ellen G. White published in 1864 formed Seventh-day Adventist Church views and influenced 20th century creationism.

==Creationist flood geology==
The Seventh-day Adventist Church, led by Ellen G. White, took a six-day creation literally and believed that she received divine messages supplementing and supporting the Bible. Her visions of the flood and its aftermath, published in 1864, described a catastrophic deluge which reshaped the entire surface of the Earth, followed by a powerful wind which piled up new high mountains, burying the bodies of men and beasts. Buried forests became coal and oil, and where God later caused these to burn, they reacted with limestone and water to cause &quot;earthquakes, volcanoes and fiery issues&quot;.

===George McCready Price===
White&#x27;s visions prompted several books by one of her followers, George McCready Price, leading to the 20th-century revival of flood geology. After years selling White&#x27;s books door-to-door, Price took a one-year teacher-training course and taught in several schools. When shown books on evolution and the fossil sequence which contradicted his beliefs, he found the answer in White&#x27;s &quot;revealing word pictures&quot; which suggested how the fossils had been buried. He studied textbooks on geology and &quot;almost tons of geological documents&quot;, finding &quot;how the actual facts of the rocks and fossils, &quot;stripped of mere theories&quot;, splendidly refute this evolutionary theory of the invariable order of the fossils, &quot;which is the very backbone of the evolution doctrine&quot;&quot;. In 1902, he produced a manuscript proposing geology based on Genesis, in which the sequence of fossils resulted from the different responses of animals to the encroaching flood. He agreed with White on the origins of coal and oil and conjectured that mountain ranges (including the Alps and Himalayas) formed from layers deposited by the flood which had then been &quot;folded and elevated to their present height by the great lateral pressure that accompanied its subsidence&quot;. He then found a report describing paraconformities and a paper on thrust faults. He concluded from these &quot;providential discoveries&quot; that it was impossible to prove the age or overall sequence of fossils and included these points in his self-published paperback of 1906, &quot;Illogical Geology: The Weakest Point in the Evolution Theory&quot;. His arguments continued this focus on disproving the sequence of strata, and he ultimately sold more than 15,000 copies of his 1923 college textbook &quot;The New Geology&quot;.

Price increasingly gained attention outside Adventist groups, and in the creation–evolution controversy other leading Christian fundamentalists praised his opposition to evolution – though none of them followed his young Earth arguments, retaining their belief in the gap or in the day-age interpretation of Genesis. Price corresponded with William Jennings Bryan and was invited to be a witness in the Scopes Trial of 1925 but declined as he was teaching in England and opposed to teaching Genesis in public schools as &quot;it would be an infringement on the cardinal American principle of separation of church and state&quot;. Price returned from England in 1929 to rising popularity among fundamentalists as a scientific author. In the same year his former student Harold W. Clark self-published the short book &quot;Back to Creationism&quot;, which recommended Price&#x27;s flood geology as the new &quot;science of creationism&quot;, introducing the label &quot;creationism&quot; as a replacement for &quot;anti-evolution&quot; of &quot;Christian Fundamentals&quot;.

In 1935, Price and Dudley Joseph Whitney (a rancher who had co-founded the Lindcove Community Bible Church) founded the Religion and Science Association (RSA). They aimed to resolve disagreements among fundamentalists with &quot;a harmonious solution&quot; which would convert them all to flood geology. Most of the organising group were Adventists; others included conservative Lutherans with similarly literalist beliefs. Bryon C. Nelson of the Norwegian Lutheran Church of America had included Price&#x27;s geological views in a 1927 book, and in 1931 published &quot;The Deluge Story in Stone: A History of the Flood Theory of Geology&quot;, which described Price as the &quot;one very outstanding advocate of the Flood&quot; of the century. The first public RSA conference in March 1936 invited various fundamentalist views but opened up differences between the organisers on the antiquity of creation and on life before Adam. The RSA went defunct in 1937, and a dispute continued between Price and Nelson, who viewed creation as occurring over 100,000 years previously.

In 1938, Price, with a group of Adventists in Los Angeles, founded what became the Deluge Geology Society (DGS), with membership restricted to those believing that the creation week comprised &quot;six literal days, and that the Deluge should be studied as the cause of the major geological changes since creation&quot;. Not all DGS adherents were Adventists; early members included the Independent Baptist Henry M. Morris and the Missouri Lutheran Walter E. Lammerts. The DGS undertook field work: in June 1941 their first &quot;Bulletin&quot; hailed the news that the Paluxy River dinosaur trackways in Texas appeared to include human footprints. Though Nelson had advised Price in 1939 that this was &quot;absurd&quot; and that the difficulty of human footprints forming during the turmoil of the deluge would &quot;knock the Flood theory all to pieces&quot;, in 1943 the DGS began raising funds for &quot;actual excavation&quot; by a Footprint Research Committee of members including the consulting geologist Clifford L. Burdick. Initially they tried to keep their research secret from &quot;unfriendly scientists&quot;. Then in 1945, to encourage backing, they announced giant human footprints, allegedly defeating &quot;at a single stroke&quot; the theory of evolution. The revelation that locals had carved the footprints, and an unsuccessful field trip that year, failed to dampen their hopes. 

However, by then doctrinal arguments had riven the DGS. The most extreme dispute began in late 1938 after Harold W. Clark observed deep drilling in oil fields and had discussions with practical geologists which dispelled the belief that the fossil sequence was random, convincing him that the evidence of thrust faults was &quot;almost incontrovertible&quot;. He wrote to Price, telling his teacher that the &quot;rocks do lie in a much more definite sequence than we have ever allowed&quot;, and proposing that the fossil sequence was explained by ecological zones before the flood. Price reacted with fury, and despite Clark emphasising their shared belief in literal recent creation, the dispute continued. In 1946 Clark set out his views in a book, &quot;The New Diluvialism&quot;, which Price denounced as &quot;Theories of Satanic Origin&quot;.

In 1941, F. Alton Everest co-founded the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) as a less confrontational forum for evangelical scientists. Some deluge geologists, including Lammerts and Price, urged close cooperation with the DGS, but Everest began to see their views as presenting an &quot;insurmountable problem&quot; for the ASA. In 1948, he requested J. Laurence Kulp, a geologist in fellowship with the Plymouth Brethren, to explore the issue. At the convention that year, Kulp examined hominid antiquity demonstrated by radiocarbon dating. At the 1949 convention a paper by Kulp was presented, giving a detailed critique of &quot;Deluge Geology&quot;, which he said had &quot;grown and infiltrated the greater portion of fundamental Christianity in America primarily due to the absence of trained Christian geologists&quot;. Kulp demonstrated that &quot;major propositions of the theory are contraindicated by established physical and chemical laws&quot;. He focused on &quot;four basic errors&quot; commonly made by flood geologists:
* saying that geology was the same as evolution
* assuming &quot;that life has been on the earth only for a few thousand years, [and] therefore the flood &quot;must&quot; account for geological strata&quot;
* misunderstanding &quot;the physical and chemical conditions under which rocks are formed&quot;
* ignoring recent discoveries such as radiometric dating that undermined their assumptions

Kulp accused Price of ignorance and deception, concluding that &quot;this unscientific theory of flood geology has done and will do considerable harm to the strong propagation of the gospel among educated people&quot;. Price said nothing during the presentation and discussion. When invited to speak, he &quot;said something very brief which missed what everyone was waiting for&quot;. Further publications made the ASA&#x27;s opposition to flood geology clear.

===Morris and Whitcomb===
In 1942, Irwin A. Moon&#x27;s &quot;Sermons from Science&quot; persuaded engineer Henry M. Morris of the importance of harmonising science and the Bible, and introduced him to the concepts of a vapor canopy causing the flood and its geological effects. About a year later Morris found Price&#x27;s &quot;New Geology&quot; a &quot;life-changing experience&quot;, and joined the DGS. His book &quot;That You Might Believe&quot; (1946) for college students included Price&#x27;s flood geology.

Morris had joined the ASA in 1949, and in the summer of 1953 he made a presentation on &quot;The Biblical Evidence for a Recent Creation and Universal Deluge&quot; at their annual conference, held at Grace Theological Seminary. He impressed a graduate student there, John C. Whitcomb, Jr. who was teaching Old Testament and Hebrew. To Whitcomb&#x27;s distress, the ASA members at the presentation &quot;politely denounced&quot; Morris.

In 1955, the ASA held a joint meeting with the Evangelical Theological Society (ETS) at the same campus, where theologian Bernard Ramm&#x27;s &quot;The Christian View of Science and Scripture&quot; (1954) caused considerable discussion. This book dismissed flood geology as typifying the &quot;ignoble tradition&quot; of fundamentalism and stated that Price could not be taken seriously, as lacking the necessary competence, training and integrity. Instead, Ramm proposed what he called progressive creationism, in which the Genesis days functioned as pictorial images revealing a process that had taken place over millions of years. ASA scientists praised Ramm&#x27;s views, but the ETS theologians proved unwilling to follow Ramm.

This encouraged Whitcomb to make his doctoral dissertation a response to Ramm and a defence of Price&#x27;s position. He systematically asked evangelical professors of apologetics, archaeology and the Old Testament about creation and the flood and in October told Morris that Ramm&#x27;s book had been sufficient incentive for him to devote his dissertation to the topic. In 1957 Whitcomb completed his 450-page dissertation, &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot;, and he promptly began summarising it for a book. Moody Publishers responded positively and agreed with him that chapters on scientific aspects should be carefully checked or written by someone with a PhD in science, but Whitcomb&#x27;s attempts to find someone with a doctorate in geology were unsuccessful. Morris gave helpful advice, expressing concern that sections were too closely based on Price and on Immanuel Velikovsky who were &quot;both considered by scientists generally as crackpots&quot;. Morris produced an outline of his planned three chapters and in December 1957 agreed to co-author the book.

Morris sent on his draft for comment in early 1959. His intended 100 pages grew to almost 350, around twice the length of Whitcomb&#x27;s eventual contribution. Recalling Morris&#x27;s earlier concerns about how Price was viewed by scientists, Whitcomb suggested that &quot;For many people, our position would be somewhat discredited&quot; by multiple references to Price in the draft, including a section headed &quot;Price and Seventh-Day Adventism&quot;. Morris agreed and even suggested avoiding the term &quot;flood geology&quot;, but it proved too useful. After discussion, the co-authors minimised these references and removed any mention of Price&#x27;s Adventist affiliation. By early 1960 they became impatient at delays when Moody Publishers expressed misgivings about the length and literal views of the book, and they went along with Rousas Rushdoony&#x27;s recommendation of a small Philadelphia publisher.

====&quot;The Genesis Flood&quot; (1961)====
The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company of Philadelphia published Whitcomb and Morris&#x27;s &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot; in February 1961. The authors took as their premise biblical infallibility: &quot;the basic argument of this volume is that the Scriptures are true&quot;. For Whitcomb, Genesis describes a worldwide flood which covered all the high mountains, Noah&#x27;s Ark with a capacity equivalent to eight freight-trains, flood waters from a canopy and the deeps, and subsequent dispersal of animals from Mount Ararat to all the continents via land bridges. He disputed the views published by Ramm and Arthur Custance. Morris then confronted readers with the dilemma of whether to believe Scripture or to accept the interpretations of trained geologists, and instead of the latter proposed &quot;a new scheme of historical geology&quot;—true both to Scripture and to &quot;God&#x27;s work&quot; revealed in nature. This was essentially Price&#x27;s &quot;The New Geology&quot; of 1923 updated for the 1960s, though with few direct references to Price.

Like Price before him, Morris argued that most fossil-bearing strata had formed during a global deluge, disputing uniformitarianism, multiple ice ages, and the geologic column. He explained the apparent fossil sequence as the outcome of marine organisms dying in the slurry of sediments in early stages of the flood, of moving currents sorting objects by size and shape, and of the mobility of vertebrates (allowing them to initially escape the flood waters). He cited Walter E. Lammerts in support of Price&#x27;s views about the thrust fault at Chief Mountain disproving the sequence.

The book went beyond Price in some areas. Morris extended the six-day creation from the Earth to the entire universe and wrote that death and decay had only begun with the fall of man, which had therefore introduced entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. He proposed that a vapor canopy, before providing water for the flood, created a mild, even climate and shielded the Earth from cosmic rays – so radiocarbon dating of antediluvian samples would not work. He cited the testimony of Clifford L. Burdick from the 1950s that some of the Glen Rose Formation dinosaur trackways near the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park overlapped human footprints, but Burdick failed to confirm this, and the claim disappeared from the third edition of &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot;.

===Creation Research Society===
In a 1957 discussion with Whitcomb, Lammerts suggested an &quot;informal association&quot; to exchange ideas, and possibly research, on flood geology. Morris was unavailable to get things started, then William J. Tinkle got in touch, and they set about recruiting others. They had difficulty in finding supporters with scientific qualifications. The Creation Research Committee of ten they put together on 9 February 1962 had varying views on the age of the Earth, but all opposed evolution. They then succeeded in recruiting others into what became the Creation Research Society (CRS) in June 1963, which grew rapidly. Getting an agreed statement of belief was problematic; they affirmed that the Bible was &quot;historically and scientifically true in the original autographs&quot; so that &quot;the account of origins in Genesis is a factual presentation of simple historical truths&quot; and &quot;The great flood described in Genesis, commonly referred to as the Noachian Flood, was an historic event worldwide in its extent and effect&quot;, but to Morris&#x27;s disappointment they did not make flood geology mandatory. They lacked a qualified geologist, and Morris persuaded the group to appoint Burdick as their Earth scientist, overcoming initial concerns raised by Lammerts. The CRS grew rapidly, with an increasing proportion of the membership adhering to strict young Earth flood geology.

The resources of the CRS for its first decade went into publication of the CRS &quot;Quarterly&quot; and a project to publish a creationist school book. Since the 1920s most U.S. schools had not taught pupils about evolution, but the launch of Sputnik exposed apparent weaknesses of U.S. science education, and the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study produced textbooks in 1963 which included the topic. When the Texas Education Agency held a hearing in October 1964 about adopting these textbooks, creationist objectors were unable to name suitable creationist alternatives. Lammerts organised a CRS textbook committee which lined up a group of authors, with John N. Moore as senior editor bringing their contributions together into a suitable textbook.

=== Creation science ===

The teaching of evolution, reintroduced in 1963 by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study textbooks, was prohibited by laws in some states. These bans were contested; the &quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot; case which began late in 1965 was decided in 1968 by the United States Supreme Court ruling that such laws violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Some creationists thought a legal decision requiring religious neutrality in schools should shield their children from teachings hostile to their religion; Nell J. Segraves and Jean E. Sumrall (a friend of Lammerts who was also associated with the CRS and the Bible-Science Association) petitioned the California State Board of Education to require that school biology texts designate evolution as a theory. In 1966 Max Rafferty as California State Superintendent of Public Instruction suggested that they demand equal time for creation, as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 allowed teachers to mention religion as long as they did not promote specific doctrines. Their first attempt failed, but in 1969 controversy arose over a proposed &quot;Science Framework for California Schools&quot;. Anticipating success, they and others in the Bible-Science Association formed Creation Science, Inc., to produce textbooks. A compromise acceptable to Segraves, Sumrall and the Board was suggested by Vernon L. Grose, and the revised 1970 &quot;Framework&quot; included &quot;While the Bible and other philosophical treatises also mention creation, science has independently postulated the various theories of creation. Therefore, creation in scientific terms is not a religious or philosophical belief.&quot; The result kept school texts free of creationism but downgraded evolution to mere speculative theory.

Creationists reacted to the California developments with a new confidence that they could introduce their ideas into schools by minimizing biblical references. Henry M. Morris declared &quot;Creationism is on the way back, this time not primarily as a religious belief, but as an alternative scientific explanation of the world in which we live.&quot; In 1970 Creation Science, Inc., combined with a planned studies center at Christian Heritage College as the Creation-Science Research Center. Morris moved to San Diego to become director of the center and academic vice-president of the college. In the fall he presented a course at the college on &quot;Scientific Creationism&quot;, the first time he is known to have used the term in public. (Two years later, the Creation-Science Research Center split with part becoming the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) led by Morris.)

CRS had found schoolbook publishers reluctant to take on their textbook, and eventually the Christian publishing company Zondervan brought out &quot;Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity&quot; in 1970. The 10,000 prints sold out within a year, and they produced 25,000 as the second impression, but hardly any public schools adopted the book. A preface by Morris claims that there were two philosophies of creation, &quot;the doctrine of evolution and the doctrine of special creation&quot;, attempting to give both equal validity. The book mostly covers uncontroversial details of biology but asserts that these were correctly seen as &quot;God&#x27;s creation&quot; or &quot;divine creation&quot;, and presents biblical creation as the correct scientific view. A chapter on &quot;Weaknesses of Geologic Evidence&quot; disputes evolutionary theories while asserting a &quot;fact that most fossil material was laid down by the flood in Noah&#x27;s time&quot;. Another chapter disputes evolutionary theory.

In the CRS &quot;Quarterly&quot; for September 1971, Morris introduced the &quot;two-model approach&quot; asserting that evolution and creation were both equally scientific and equally religious, and soon afterwards he said they were &quot;competing scientific hypotheses&quot;. For the third printing of &quot;Biology: A Search for Order in Complexity&quot; in 1974, the editor John N. Moore added a preface setting out this approach as &quot;the two basic viewpoints of origins&quot;, the &quot;evolution model&quot; and the &quot;creation model&quot;. When an Indiana school decided to use the book as their biology text, the &quot;Hendren v. Campbell&quot; district court case banned its use in public schools as infringing the Establishment Clause. Judge Michael T. Dugan, II, described it as &quot;a text obviously designed to present &quot;only&quot; the view of Biblical Creationism in a favorable light&quot;, contravening the constitution by promotion of a specific sectarian religious view.

As a tactic to gain the same scientific status as evolution, flood geology proponents had effectively relabeled the Bible-based flood geology of George McCready Price as &quot;creation science&quot; or &quot;scientific creationism&quot; by the mid-1970s. At the CRS board meeting in spring 1972, members were told to start using &quot;scientific creationism&quot;, a phrase used interchangeably with &quot;creation science&quot;; Morris explained that preferences differed, though neither was ideal as &quot;one simple term&quot; could not &quot;identify such a complex and comprehensive subject.&quot; In the 1974 ICR handbook for high-school teachers titled &quot;Scientific Creationism&quot;, Morris uses the two-model approach to support his argument that creationism could &quot;be taught without reference to the book of Genesis or to other religious literature or to religious doctrines&quot;, and in public schools only the &quot;basic scientific creation model&quot; should be taught, rather than biblical creationism which &quot;would open the door to wide interpretations of Genesis&quot; or to non-Christian cosmogonies. He did not deny having been influenced by the Bible. In his preface to the book dated July 1974, Morris as editor outlines how the &quot;Public School Edition&quot; of the book evaluates evidence from a &quot;strictly scientific point of view&quot; without &quot;reference to the Bible or other religious literature&quot;, while the &quot;General Edition&quot; is &quot;essentially identical&quot; except for an additional chapter on &quot;Creation according to Scripture&quot; that &quot;places the scientific evidence in its proper biblical and theological context.&quot;

The main ideas in creation science are: the belief in &quot;creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot;&quot; (Latin: out of nothing); the conviction that the Earth was created within the last 6,000 years; the belief that mankind and other life on Earth were created as distinct fixed &quot;baraminological&quot; &quot;kinds&quot;; and the idea that fossils found in geological strata were deposited during a cataclysmic flood which completely covered the entire Earth. As a result, creation science also challenges the commonly accepted geologic and astrophysical theories for the age and origins of the Earth and Universe, which creationists acknowledge are irreconcilable to the account in the Book of Genesis.

==Creationist arguments for a global flood==

=== Fossils ===
The geologic column and the fossil record are used as major pieces of evidence in the modern scientific explanation of the development and evolution of life on Earth as well as a means to establish the age of Earth. Young Earth creationists such as Morris and Whitcomb in their 1961 book, &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot;, say that the age of the fossils depends on the amount of time credited to the geologic column, which they ascribe to be about one year. Some flood geologists dispute geology&#x27;s assembled global geologic column since index fossils are used to link geographically isolated strata to other strata across the map. Fossils are often dated by their proximity to strata containing index fossils whose age has been determined by its location on the geologic column. Oard and others say that the identification of fossils as index fossils has been too error-prone for index fossils to be used reliably to make those correlations, or to date local strata using the assembled geologic scale.

Other creationists accept the existence of the geological column and believe that it indicates a sequence of events that might have occurred during the global flood. Institute for Creation Research creationists such as Andrew Snelling, Steven A. Austin and Kurt Wise take this approach, as does Creation Ministries International. They cite the Cambrian explosion—the appearance of abundant fossils in the upper Ediacaran (Vendian) period and lower Cambrian period—as the pre-flood/flood boundary, the presence in such sediments of fossils that do not occur later in the geological record as part of a pre-flood biota that perished and the absence of fossilized organisms that appear later (such as angiosperms and mammals) as a result of erosion of sediments deposited by the flood as waters receded off the land. Creationists say that fossilization can only take place when the organism is buried quickly to protect the remains from destruction by scavengers or decomposition. They say that the fossil record provides evidence of a single cataclysmic flood and not of a series of slow changes accumulating over millions of years.

Flood geologists have proposed numerous hypotheses to reconcile the sequence of fossils evident in the fossil column with the literal account of Noah&#x27;s flood in the Bible. Whitcomb and Morris proposed three possible factors:

# hydrological, whereby the relative buoyancies of the remains (based on the organisms&#x27; shapes and densities) determined the sequence in which their remains settled to the bottom of the flood-waters
# ecological, suggesting organisms living at the ocean bottom succumbed first in the flood and those living at the highest altitudes last
# anatomical/behavioral, the ordered sequence in the fossil column resulting from the very different responses to the rising waters between different kinds of organisms due to their diverse mobilities and original habitats. In a scenario put forth by Morris, the remains of marine life settled to the bottom first, followed by the slower-moving lowland reptiles, and culminating with humans, whose superior intelligence and ability to flee enabled them to reach higher elevations before the flood waters overcame them.

Some creationists believe that oil and coal deposits formed rapidly in sedimentary layers as volcanoes or flood waters flattened forests and buried the debris. They believe the vegetation decomposed rapidly into oil or coal due to the heat of the subterranean waters as they were unleashed from the Earth during the flood or by the high temperatures created as the remains were compressed by water and sediment.

Creationists continue to search for evidence in the natural world that they consider consistent with the above description, such as evidence of rapid formation. For example, there have been claims of raindrop marks and water ripples at layer boundaries, sometimes associated with the claimed fossilized footprints of men and dinosaurs walking together. Such footprint evidence has been debunked, and some have been shown to be fakes.

=== Widespread flood stories ===

Proponents of flood geology state that &quot;native global flood stories are documented as history or legend in almost every region on earth&quot;. &quot;These flood tales are frequently linked by common elements that parallel the biblical account including the warning of the coming flood, the construction of a boat in advance, the storage of animals, the inclusion of family, and the release of birds to determine if the water level had subsided.&quot; They suggest that &quot;the overwhelming consistency among flood legends found in distant parts of the globe indicates they were derived from the same origin, but oral transcription has changed the details through time&quot;.

Anthropologist Patrick Nunn rejects this view and highlights the fact that much of the human population lives near water sources such as rivers and coasts, where unusually severe floods can be expected to occur occasionally and will be recorded in local mythology.

== Proposed mechanisms of flood geology ==
Price attempted to fit a great deal of Earth&#x27;s geologic history into a model based on a few accounts from the Bible. Price&#x27;s simple model was used by Whitcomb and Morris initially, but they did not build on the model in the 1960s and 1970s. However, a rough sketch of a creationist model could be constructed from creationist publications and debate material. Recent creationist efforts attempt to build complex models that incorporate as much scientific evidence as possible into the biblical narrative. Some scientific evidence used for these models was formerly rejected by creationists. These models attempt to explain continental movements in a short time frame, the order of the fossil record, and the Pleistocene ice age.

=== Runaway subduction ===
In the 1960s and 1970s a simple creationist model proposed that, &quot;The Flood split the land mass into the present continents.&quot; Steve Austin and other creationists proposed a preliminary model of catastrophic plate tectonics (CPT) in 1994. Their work built on earlier papers by John Baumgardner and Russell Humphreys in 1986. Baumgardner proposed a model of mantle convection that allows for runaway subduction, and Humphrey associated mantle convection with rapid magnetic reversals in Earth history. Baumgardner&#x27;s proposal holds that the rapid plunge of former oceanic plates into the mantle (caused by an unknown trigger mechanism) increased local mantle pressures to the point that its viscosity dropped several magnitudes according to known properties of mantle silicates. Once initiated, sinking plates caused the spread of low viscosity throughout the mantle, resulting in runaway mantle convection and catastrophic tectonic motion which dragged continents across the surface of the Earth. Once the former ocean plates (which are thought to be denser than the mantle) reached the bottom of the mantle, an equilibrium resulted. Pressures dropped, viscosity increased, runaway mantle convection stopped, leaving the surface of the Earth rearranged. Proponents point to subducted slabs in the mantle which are still relatively cool, which they regard as evidence that they have not been there for millions of years which would result in temperature equilibration.

Given that conventional plate tectonics accounts for much of the geomorphic features of continents and oceans, it is natural that creationists would seek to develop a high speed version of the same process. CPT explains many geological features, provides mechanisms for the biblical flood, and minimizes appeals to miracles. Some prominent creationists (Froede, Oard, Read) oppose CPT for various technical reasons. One main objection is that the model assumes the supercontinent Pangaea was intact at the initiation of the year-long flood. The CPT process then tore Pangaea apart creating the current configuration of the continents. But the breakup of Pangaea started early in the Mesozoic, meaning that CPT only accounts for part of the entire Phanerozoic geological record. CPT in this form only explains part of the geological column that flood geology normally explains. Modifying the CPT model to account for the entire Phanerozoic including multiple Wilson Cycles would complicate the model considerably.

Other objections of CPT include the amount of heat produced for the rapid plate movements, and the fact that the cooling of hot oceanic plates and the raising of continental plates would take a great deal of time and require multiple small scale catastrophes after the flood ended. The original CPT proposal of Austin and others in 1994 was admittedly preliminary, but the major issues have not been solved.

The vast majority of geologists regard the hypothesis of catastrophic plate tectonics as pseudoscience; they reject it in favor of the conventional geological theory of plate tectonics. It has been argued that the tremendous release of energy necessitated by such an event would boil off the Earth&#x27;s oceans, making a global flood impossible. Not only does catastrophic plate tectonics lack any plausible geophysical mechanism by which its changes might occur, it also is contradicted by considerable geological evidence (which is in turn consistent with conventional plate tectonics), including:
* Many volcanic oceanic island chains, such as the Hawaiian Islands, yield evidence of the ocean floor having moved over volcanic hotspots. These islands have widely ranging ages (determined via both radiometric dating and relative erosion) that contradict the catastrophic tectonic hypothesis of rapid development and thus a similar age.
* Radiometric dating and sedimentation rates on the ocean floor likewise contradict the hypothesis that it all came into existence nearly contemporaneously.
* Catastrophic tectonics does not allow sufficient time for guyots to have their peak eroded away (leaving these seamounts&#x27; characteristic flat tops).
* Runaway subduction does not explain the kind of continental collision illustrated by that of the Indian and Eurasian Plates. (For further information see orogeny.)

Conventional plate tectonics accounts for the geological evidence already, including innumerable details that catastrophic plate tectonics cannot, such as why there is gold in California, silver in Nevada, salt flats in Utah, and coal in Pennsylvania, without requiring any extraordinary mechanisms to do so.

=== Vapor/water canopy ===
Isaac Newton Vail, a Quaker schoolteacher, in his 1912 work &quot;The Earth&#x27;s Annular System&quot;, extrapolated from the nebular hypothesis what he called the annular system of Earth history, with the Earth being originally surrounded by rings resembling those of Saturn, or &quot;canopies&quot; of water vapor. Vail hypothesised that, one by one, these canopies collapsed on the Earth, resulting in fossils being buried in a &quot;succession of stupendous cataclysms, separated by unknown periods of time&quot;. The Genesis flood was thought to have been caused by &quot;the last remnant&quot; of this vapor. Although this final flood was geologically significant, it was not held to account for as much of the fossil record as George McCready Price had asserted.

Vail&#x27;s ideas about geology appeared in Charles Taze Russell&#x27;s 1912 &quot;The Photo-Drama of Creation&quot; and subsequently in Joseph Franklin Rutherford&#x27;s &quot;Creation&quot; of 1927 and later publications. The Seventh-day Adventist physicist Robert W. Woods also proposed a vapor canopy, before &quot;The Genesis Flood&quot; gave it prominent and repeated mention in 1961.

Although the vapor-canopy theory has fallen into disfavour among most creationists, Dillow in 1981 and Vardiman in 2003 attempted to defend the idea. Among its more vocal adherents, controversial young earth creationist Kent Hovind uses it as the basis for his eponymous &quot;Hovind Theory&quot;. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses propose as the water source of the deluge a &quot;heavenly ocean&quot; that was over the Earth from the second creative day until the flood.

== Modern geology ==

Modern geology, its sub-disciplines and other scientific disciplines use the scientific method to analyze the geology of the earth. The key tenets of flood geology are refuted by scientific analysis and do not have any standing in the scientific community. Modern geology relies on established principles, one of the most important of which is Charles Lyell&#x27;s principle of uniformitarianism. In relation to geological forces it states that the shaping of the Earth has occurred by means of mostly slow-acting forces that can be seen in operation today. By applying these principles, geologists have determined that the Earth is approximately 4.54 billion years old. They study the lithosphere of the Earth to gain information on the history of the planet. Geologists divide Earth&#x27;s history into eons, eras, periods, epochs, and faunal stages characterized by well-defined breaks in the fossil record (see Geologic time scale). In general, there is a lack of any evidence for any of the above effects proposed by flood geologists, and their claims of fossil layering are not taken seriously by scientists.

===Geochronology===
Geochronology is the science of determining the absolute age of rocks, fossils, and sediments by a variety of techniques. These methods indicate that the Earth as a whole is about 4.54 billion years old and that the strata that, according to flood geology, were laid down during the flood some 6,000 years ago, were actually deposited gradually over many millions of years.

===Paleontology===
If the flood were responsible for fossilization, then all the animals now fossilized must have been living together on the Earth just before the flood. Based on estimates of the number of remains buried in the Karoo fossil formation in Africa, this would correspond to an abnormally high density of vertebrates worldwide, close to 2,100 per acre. Creationists argue that evidence for the geological column is fragmentary, and all the complex layers of chalk occurred in the approach to the 150th day of Noah&#x27;s flood. However, the entire geologic column is found in several places and shows multiple features, including evidence of erosion and burrowing through older layers, which are inexplicable on a short timescale. Carbonate hardgrounds and the fossils associated with them show that the sediments include evidence of long hiatuses in deposition that are not consistent with flood dynamics or timing.

===Geochemistry===
Proponents of flood geology are unable to account for the alternation between calcite seas and aragonite seas through the Phanerozoic. The cyclical pattern of carbonate hardgrounds, calcitic and aragonitic ooids, and calcite-shelled fauna has apparently been controlled by seafloor spreading rates and the flushing of seawater through hydrothermal vents which changes its Mg/Ca ratio.

===Sedimentary rock features===
Phil Senter&#x27;s 2011 article, &quot;The Defeat of Flood Geology by Flood Geology&quot;, in the journal &quot;Reports of the National Center for Science Education&quot;, discusses &quot;sedimentologic and other geologic features that Flood geologists have identified as evidence that particular strata cannot have been deposited during a time when the entire planet was under water...and distribution of strata that predate the existence of the Ararat mountain chain.&quot; These include continental basalts, terrestrial tracks of animals, and marine communities preserving multiple in-situ generations included in the rocks of most or all Phanerozoic periods, and the basalt even in the younger Precambrian rocks. Others, occurring in rocks of several geologic periods, include lake deposits and eolian (wind) deposits. Using their own words, flood geologists find evidence in every Paleozoic and Mesozoic period, and in every epoch of the Cenozoic period, indicating that a global flood could not have occurred during that interval.
The global flood cannot explain geological formations such as angular unconformities, where sedimentary rocks have been tilted and eroded then more sedimentary layers deposited on top, needing long periods of time for these processes. There is also the time needed for the erosion of valleys in sedimentary rock mountains. Furthermore, the flood should have produced large-scale effects spread throughout the entire world. Erosion should be evenly distributed, yet the levels of erosion in, for example, the Appalachians and the Rocky Mountains differ significantly.

=== Physics ===

The engineer Jane Albright notes several scientific failings of the canopy theory, reasoning from first principles in physics. Among these are that enough water to create a flood of even of rain would form a vapor blanket thick enough to make the Earth too hot for life, since water vapor is a greenhouse gas; the same blanket would have an optical depth sufficient to effectively obscure all incoming starlight.

<text>John Allen Amos Jr. (December 27, 1939 – August 21, 2024) was an American actor. He was best known for his role for portraying James Evans Sr. on the CBS television series &quot;Good Times&quot;. and General Grant in &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; (1990). He is also known as the adult Kunta Kinte in the landmark miniseries &quot;Roots&quot; and His other television work includes &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, a recurring role as Admiral Percy Fitzwallace on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and the role of the Mayor of Washington DC Ethan Baker in the series &quot;The District&quot;. Amos was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and an NAACP Image Award. In film, he played numerous supporting roles in movies such as &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; (1982), &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988), and &quot;Coming 2 America&quot; (2021).

==Early life==
Amos was born in Newark, New Jersey, on December 27, 1939, the son of Annabelle and John A. Amos Sr., an auto mechanic. John Jr. grew up in East Orange, New Jersey, and graduated from East Orange High School in 1958. He enrolled at Long Beach City College and graduated from Colorado State University becoming a social worker with a degree in sociology.

John Amos Jr. played on the university&#x27;s football team. After college, he was a Golden Gloves boxing champion.

==Football career==
In 1964, Amos signed a free agent contract with the Denver Broncos (AFL 1964), Unable to run the 40-yard dash because of a pulled hamstring, he was released on the second day of training camp. He played for various sides during his career, the Canton Bulldogs (UFL 1964), Joliet Chargers (UFL 1964), Norfolk Neptunes (COFL 1965), Wheeling Ironmen COFL 1965, Jersey City Jets (ACFL 1966), Waterbury Orbits (ACFL 1966), and the Victoria Steelers (COFL 1967). In 1967, Amos signed a free agent contract with the AFL&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs (AFL 1967). Coach Hank Stram told him, &quot;You&#x27;re not a football player, you&#x27;re a man who is trying to play football.&quot;

==Acting career==

Amos became first known in 1971 when he appeared with Anson Williams in a commercial for McDonald&#x27;s. That same year, he had a small part in the cult film &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, playing a radio engineer alongside Cleavon Little.

Amos&#x27; first major TV role was as Gordy Howard, the weatherman on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show,&quot; from 1970 until 1973. After the death of Betty White in 2021, Amos and Joyce Bulifant (who played Marie Slaughter) were the last surviving cast members of the show, excluding child actors.

===&quot;Good Times&quot;===
Amos is best known for his portrayal of James Evans Sr., the husband of Florida Evans, on the American sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot; (1974–1976). He had previously appeared in the same role three times on the sitcom &quot;Maude&quot; before continuing it in 61 episodes of &quot;Good Times&quot;. Although cast as a hardworking middle-aged father of three, Amos was 34 when the show began production in January 1974; he was only eight years older than the actor who played his oldest son, Jimmie Walker, and 19 years younger than his screen wife, Esther Rolle. Like Rolle, Amos wanted to portray a positive image of an African-American family struggling against the odds in a poor neighborhood, but he expressed dissatisfaction after he saw the premise slighted by a lower level of comedy on &quot;Good Times.&quot;

During his tenure on the sitcom, Amos openly clashed with the writers of the show, pointing to the scripts&#x27; lack of authenticity in portraying the African-American experience. He notably criticized what he felt was too much of an emphasis on Jimmie Walker&#x27;s character J.J. and a lesser regard for the other two Evans children. He also criticized J.J.&#x27;s stereotypical buffoonish personality. This led to his dismissal by executive producer Norman Lear at the end of season 3 in 1976. In a 2017 interview, Amos said that the sitcom&#x27;s writers did not understand African-Americans. He told them, &quot;That just doesn&#x27;t happen in the community. We don&#x27;t think that way. We don&#x27;t act that way. We don&#x27;t let our children do that.&quot; His character was killed off by the writers, leading to a memorable scene in which his screen wife, Rolle, screamed, “Damn! Damn! Damn!”

===Films, music, and other TV roles===

In 1977, Amos starred in the ABC-TV Miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;, as the adult Kunta Kinte, based on the book by author Alex Haley. In 1980, he starred in the television film &quot;&quot;.

<text>Jan van Scorel (1 August 1495 – 6 December 1562) was a Dutch painter, who played a leading role in introducing aspects of Italian Renaissance painting into Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting. He was one of the early painters of the Romanist style who had spent a number of years in Italy, where he thoroughly absorbed the Italian style of painting. His trip to Italy coincided with the brief reign of the only Dutch pope in history, Adrian VI in 1522–23. The pope made him a court painter and superintendent of his collection of antiquities. His stay in Italy lasted from 1518 to 1524 and he also visited Nuremberg, Venice and Jerusalem. Venetian art had an important impact on the development of his style.

He differed from most Romanists in that he was a native of the northern Netherlands and not of Flanders and that he remained most of his life in the northern Netherlands. He settled permanently in Utrecht in 1530 and established a large workshop on the Italian model. The workshop mainly produced altarpieces, many of which were destroyed in the Reformation iconoclasm in the years just after his death. He also held clerical appointments. This did not stop him from having a long-time relationship with a mistress who may have modelled for some of his female figures.

==Biography==
Van Scorel was born in Schoorl, north of Alkmaar and close to Egmond Abbey. It is not known whether he began his studies under the Master of Alkmaar, Pieter Gerritsz in Haarlem, Jacob Cornelisz in Amsterdam, or with Jan Gossaert in Utrecht, but it is certain that the last two were the master painters he would meet later in his life and who would have the greatest effect on his technique. Van Scorel is recorded in Haarlem in 1517 where he perhaps collaborated with his contemporary Maarten van Heemskerck, who like him, had been born close to Alkmaar (they certainly collaborated in Haarlem in 1528).

In 1524 Jan Gossaert is recorded at Duurstede Castle, near Utrecht, where Jan van Scorel was his pupil. Van Scorel began traveling through Europe in his early twenties after visiting Utrecht. In 1518–22 he is registered in Venice, and along the way, heading to Nuremberg and then on via Austria over the Alps. In the village of Obervellach in 1520, he completed his first representative work, the &quot;Frangipani-Altar&quot; in St. Martin&#x27;s church. Giorgione was a considerable influence on Van Scorel during his tenure in Venice. After leaving Venice, Van Scorel was in Rome from 1522 to 1524 and made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. His experiences in Jerusalem are depicted in many of his later works. Perhaps Van Scorel&#x27;s example encouraged Van Heemskerck to travel to Rome himself later.

In 1521, Van Scorel returned to Rome where he met the Dutch pope Pope Adrian VI, who he may have met earlier in Utrecht. The pope appointed him painter to the Vatican. The pope sat for a portrait by Van Scorel. Van Scorel underwent the influence of Michelangelo and Raphael and succeeded Raphael as Keeper of the Belvedere.

Upon his return to the Netherlands in 1524, he settled in Utrecht where he began a successful career as a painter and a teacher. Van Scorel was a very educated man and skilled as an engineer and an architect, as well as an artist. He was also multi-lingual, no doubt as a result of his travels. He made the plans for building a polder in his native North Holland, called the Zijpe- en Hazepolder, that was later financed by his friend from Antwerp, the merchant Servaes de Haese. Perhaps because of the work on this polder, he is registered in Haarlem in 1528, where he collaborated with Heemskerck and assisted with the school there that Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert would later run.
Considered to be the leading Netherlandish Romanist, Van Scorel moved to Ghent for painting contracts before returning to Utrecht for the same reason, where he died in 1562, leaving behind a wealth of portraits and altarpieces. Though many of his works fell victim to the Iconoclasm in 1566, some still remain and can be seen primarily at museums in the Netherlands.

==Influences==
Contemporary painters that Van Scorel may have met, taught, and/or collaborated with, are Cornelis Willemsz (1481–1552), Aertgen van Leyden, the Master of Alkmaar (or Cornelis Buys), Pieter Gerritsz, Jacob Cornelisz, Jan Gossaert, Maarten van Heemskerck, Antonis Mor, Lambert Sustris, Master of the Good Samaritan, and Martin Schermus van Deventer. He also was the teacher of the painter Michel Coxie whom he took to Italy with him in 1532 for seven years. Coxie &amp; van Scorel returned to Mechlan in 1539 and brought with them the influence of Michelangelo, Raphael, and Leonardo. Coxie in particular was known as a colorist and it was his works that were studied by the young Rubens.

<text>Jay Chou Chieh-lun (; born 18 January 1979) is a Taiwanese singer-songwriter, actor, director, and businessman. Regarded as one of the most successful and influential singers in the Chinese-speaking world, he is often referred to as the &quot;King of Mandopop&quot;. Chou&#x27;s works, which often blend Eastern and Western styles, has been recognized for its impact on fashion and musical trends in the Greater China region.

In 2000, Chou released his debut studio album &quot;Jay&quot; to runaway success, solidified by his second album &quot;Fantasy&quot; (2001). &quot;Common Jasmine Orange&quot; (2004) was recognized by Guinness World Records as the best-selling physical album in China in the 21st century, having sold over 2.6 million copies. His music videos are among the most-viewed on YouTube, with six music videos surpassing 100 million views, the most of any Chinese artists. He has won over 15 Golden Melody Awards—the most by any singer in the ceremony&#x27;s history. He served as a judge on &quot;The&quot; &quot;Voice of China&quot; for four seasons from 2016 to 2020. Chou became the first Mandopop artist to top IFPI’s Global Album Sales Chart, with his &quot;Greatest Works of Art&quot; (2022) being the world’s best-selling record in 2022.

In the non-Chinese-speaking world, Chou is perhaps better known for his work beyond music. He made his acting debut in the film &quot;Initial D&quot; (2005), followed by roles in Zhang Yimou&#x27;s epic &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; (2006), Kevin Chu&#x27;s &quot;Kung Fu Dunk&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Treasure Hunter&quot; (2009), Hollywood films &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (2011) and &quot;Now You See Me 2&quot; (2016). He directed and starred in films &quot;Secret&quot; (2007), &quot;The Rooftop&quot; (2013) and TV series &quot;Pandamen&quot; (2010). He hosted the CTI talkshow &quot;Mr. J Channel&quot; (2010–2011) and the Netflix reality show &quot;J-Style Trip&quot; starting in 2020. As a businessman, Chou has been the President of his own fashion brand, PHANTACi, since 2006 and is a founding member of the talent agency JVR Music, established in 2007.

== Early life ==
Jay Chou was born and raised in Linkou, Taipei County, Taiwan. He is of Hokkien descent. Both his parents were secondary school teachers: his mother, Yeh Hui-Mei (), who was an art teacher, while his father, Chou Yao-Chung (), is a biomedical researcher. His mother noticed his sensitivity to music and took him to piano lessons at the age of four. During his childhood, he was fascinated with capturing sounds and songs with his tape recorder, which he carried everywhere with him. In the third grade, he became interested in music theory and also started cello lessons. He was an only child and loved to play piano, imitate TV actors, and perform magic tricks. His favorite composer was, and is still to this day, Frédéric Chopin. Jay graduated from Taipei Jinhua High School. His parents divorced when he was 14 and he was teased by his classmates, which caused him to become reclusive and introverted. He had no friends and preferred to be alone, listening to music, contemplating and daydreaming. At , he majored in piano and minored in cello. He showed a talent for improvisation, became fond of pop music, and began to write songs.

Chou was conscripted for mandatory military service after graduating from high school with inadequate grades for university. However, severe back pain triggered by sports eventually led to the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (HLA-B27), and he was exempted from military service. Meanwhile, he found a job as a waiter.

== Early career ==
Chou&#x27;s mother initially inspired Chou to become a music teacher, while Chou remained relatively clueless on what to do with his life. Without his knowledge, a friend registered both their names in a talent show called &quot;Super New Talent King&quot; in 1998. Chou played the piano accompaniment for his friend, whose singing was described as &quot;lousy&quot;. Although they did not win, the show&#x27;s host, Jacky Wu – an influential character in Taiwan&#x27;s entertainment business – happened to glance at the music score and was impressed with its complexity. Wu then asked who wrote it, discovered Chou and hired him as a contract composer and paired him with the novice lyricist Vincent Fang for his then record company, Alfa Music. Chou then spent most of his time in Wu&#x27;s studio learning music producing, sound mixing, recording, and writing songs.

Although he was trained in classical music, Chou combines Chinese and Western music styles to produce songs that fuse R&amp;B, rock and pop genres. However, Wu told Chou that he would help Chou release an album after he wrote 50 songs and he would pick 10 from there. Chou already had an arsenal of songs he wrote for others but had been rejected, so among those he chose 10 for his debut CD album, &quot;Jay&quot;, released in 2000. The album established his reputation as a musically gifted singer-songwriter whose style is a fusion of R&amp;B, rap, classical music, and yet distinctly Chinese. His fame grew quickly in Overseas Chinese communities and Sinophone-speaking regions throughout Southeast Asia.

== Music career ==

=== 2000–2002: Debut and commercial success ===

In 2000, under the recommendation of JR Yang, Jay Chou began to sing his own songs. Chou launched his debut album &quot;Jay&quot; under Alfa Music under Jacky Wu in 2000. Chou arranged the compilation, harmony, and production of all the songs. The album combines R&amp;B, hip-hop, and other musical styles. Among them, the hit song &quot;Starry Mood&quot; () won the 24th China Top Ten Chinese Gold Songs. The album was promoted heavily by Jacky Wu in the entertainment shows he hosted. Chou himself also appeared on a few television programs to promote the album. Chou was marketed as a talented singer-composer with a unique tune. His collaboration with Vincent Fang and Vivian Hsu on the release brought about a few hits.

In 2001, Chou held his first series of five solo concerts, titled the Fantasy Concert, with the first stop on 11 January 2001, at the Taoyuan Arena, Taiwan. Followed by two shows at the Hong Kong Coliseum, one in Malaysia and ended in Singapore on 10 February 2002. On 9 July 2001, songwriters Jay and Yungai Hayung performed &quot;The Roof&quot;, which was included in the album &quot;A Little Wild&quot; by Yungai Hayung. After promoting his debut album, Chou returned to the studio for the next twelve months to record and produce his next album, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, which helped him become an established star. This album was released in September 2001 and became a big hit, selling an estimated two million copies in Taiwan alone. However, in late 2001, Wu, due to mismanagement, decided to sell Alfa Music, including Chou’s contract, to Holiday Co., Ltd., a KTV chain operator. The sale, finalized in 2002, soured Chou’s relationship with Wu, leading to a prolonged feud. &quot;Fantasy&quot; went on receiving ten nominations and won five awards at the 13th Golden Melody Awards in 2002, where Chou notably did not thank Wu. The album&#x27;s R&amp;B hits such as &quot;Simple Love&quot; () &quot;Love Before BC&quot; (愛在西元前), which won Chou the Best Composer award, and &quot;Can&#x27;t Express Myself&quot; () are some of Chou&#x27;s most popular songs till today.

Chou&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Eight Dimensions&quot;, became another commercial success and is similar in style to his second. Another collaboration with Fang, &quot;The Eight Dimensions&quot; included songs that invoke imagery, Chou&#x27;s &quot;mumbling&quot; style, and mainly R&amp;B tunes. The singer has sold over 750,000 copies of &quot;Fantasy&quot; as of 2002, throughout the region. In the same year, Chou held his debut concert tour &quot;The One&quot;. There was also more crossover activity between Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as steadily increasing activity by Japanese acts in the region. Chou released the compilation album &quot;Partners&quot; in April 2002, featuring 12 songs consisting of Chou&#x27;s musical and Vincent Fang&#x27;s lyrical compositions. Fang has written the words to more than 40 of Chou&#x27;s songs, was the chief editor of Chou&#x27;s book &quot;Grandeur de D Major&quot;, and is now Chou&#x27;s business partner (together with Chou&#x27;s manager JR Yang) for the record company JVR Music. His second concert tour, The One Concert, commenced on 28 September 2002, at Taipei Municipal Stadium, followed by 11 stops and ended at Shenzhen Stadium, China on 3 January 2004.

=== 2003–2005: &quot;Yeh Hui-Mei&quot;, &quot;Common Jasmine Orange&quot;, and &quot;November&#x27;s Chopin&quot; ===
In 2003, Chou released his fourth album &quot;Yeh Hui-Mei&quot; named after his own mother. After the release of this album, he attended the Golden Melody Awards for his previous album&#x27;s nomination. The album &quot;The Eight Dimensions&quot; was nominated for 5 categories but failed to win a single category. As a result, Chou didn&#x27;t take his losses too lightly, as he wrote on his next album the song &quot;Grandmother&quot; (外婆) that he actually took the Golden Melody Awards way too seriously. Ironically, his then-current album &quot;Yeh Hui-mei&quot; would later go on to win a Golden Melody as &quot;Best Album of the year &quot; award the following year in 2004.

&quot;Yeh Hui-mei&quot; was both a commercial and musical success. The album features songs on Mafia and drug lords &quot;In Father&#x27;s Name&quot; (以父之名) which at first hearing was very unorthodox but displays Jay&#x27;s creative writing and producing ability. This album can be seen as Jay&#x27;s second milestone because it gained an extremely positive reaction from both critics and supporters of his music. Jay also wanted to prove that he is a versatile artist and does not only write R&amp;B songs, but he also ventured into more rock-flavored tunes such as &quot;Sunny Day&quot; (晴天) which was one of the most played songs of the year. This song gained widespread popularity and high school students started learning guitar to play the drift of the song&#x27;s intro. He has performed live duets with Landy Wen, Jolin Tsai, and former girlfriend and news anchor Patty Hou.

In 2004, his album &quot;Common Jasmin Orange&quot;, released by Sony Music, excelled in Taiwan, Hong Kong and China Mainland. Despite insurmountable piracy in Taiwan, which has reduced the recording industry to 5 to 10 percent from his heyday as a Taiwanese singer, Chou managed to produce a record that sold a record 300,000 copies in spite of the ordeal. In Hong Kong, his album surpassed local albums with sales of 50,000 units. In China, the official figure reached 2.6 million units, a figure that no other Mandopop artist has attained. The World Music Awards in September 2004 held in Las Vegas formally acknowledged him as the most popular Chinese singer based on commercial sales performance.

Chou started the band Nan Quan Mama in 2004, selecting band members and overseeing their album production. The group has been noted for sounding too similar to their mentor; as a result, Chou has reduced his involvement in the band, though he continues to increase their exposure by inviting them as guests performers for his concerts and music videos. In 2005, his album &quot;November&#x27;s Chopin&quot; continued this record of success with sales of 2,500,000 copies sold in Asia including 280,000 copies sold in Taiwan. It became his first album to reach number one in Taiwan following the creation of the G-Music Combo album chart in July 2005. The track &quot;Hair Like Snow&quot; incorporated traditional Chinese instruments including the pipa and yangqin.

=== 2006–2010: &quot;Still Fantasy&quot;, &quot;On the Run!&quot;, and &quot;Capricorn&quot; ===

Two studio recordings of duets have been officially placed in his albums: &quot;Coral Sea&quot; in 2005 with Lara Veronin (of Nan Quan Mama) and &quot;Faraway&quot; in 2006 featuring Fei Yu-ching. Chou continued to make one album per year; the singer&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Still Fantasy&quot;, was released on 5 September 2006. The album peaked at number one on the Taiwanese G-Music Chart and number 63 on the Japanese Oricon Album Chart, and sold 250,000 copies in Taiwan. The record produced the tracks &quot;Far Away,&quot; &quot;Listen to Mom,&quot; and &quot;White Windmill,&quot; which were listed at number two, number eight and number 53, respectively, on year-end song chart compiled by Hit FM. In April 2006, the album&#x27;s track &quot;Chrysanthemum Terrace&quot; won Best Original Film Song at the 26th Hong Kong Film Awards.

&quot;On the Run!&quot; was released on 2 November 2007. The record contained hits such as &quot;Blue and White Porcelain&quot; (). It peaked at number one on the album charts in Taiwan and received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of Singapore (RIAS) in 2020. The songs &quot;Cowboy is Very Busy&quot;, &quot;Rainbow&quot;, and &quot;Sunshine Nerd&quot;, were ranked at number 11, number 28, and number 59, respectively, on the year-end Hit FM Top 100 Singles chart. Chou embarked on The World Tour in support of the release, visiting numerous countries including Taiwan, China, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Canada and the United States from November 2007 to August 2009. The first concert at the Banqiao Stadium in Taipei attracted an audience of 30,000 people. Chou&#x27;s three-day concert at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo in February 2008 drew a total of 30,000 people. Following the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake, Chou&#x27;s scheduled concert in Chongqing on 24 May 2008 was changed into a charity fundraising event. The entire proceeds from the concert were donated to aid the affected region.

Chou&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Capricorn&quot;, was released on 14 October 2008. The record produced songs such as &quot;Floral Sea&quot; (), Lan-Ting-Xu&quot; (), and &quot;Rice Field&quot; (). Streamed more than one billion times, &quot;Rice Field&quot; is a song about childhood memories and is reportedly written after the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake. &quot;Rice Field&quot;, &quot;Give Me the Time of a Song&quot;, and &quot;The Promised Love&quot;, was ranked number 3, number 17, and number 56, respectively, on year-end Hit FM Top 100 Singles chart in 2008. The album became certified platinum in Singapore in 2020. In October 2009, Chou was featured on Cindy Yen&#x27;s song &quot;Sand Painting&quot;. In 2010, to celebrate his 10-year career in the entertainment industry, Chou embarked on his fifth concert tour, The Era World Tour. The tour kicked off with a series of three concerts at the Taipei Arena from 11–13 June 2010. It then continued with 40 more stops, ending on 17–18 December 2011 at the Kaohsiung Arena. The stage design for The Era World Tour combined elements of avant-garde futurism and medieval aesthetics. 50,000 people attended the concert in Zhengzhou, China on 4 September 2010.

=== 2011–2016: World tours and continued success ===
Chou collaborated with the late NBA player Kobe Bryant on the single &quot;The Heaven and Earth Challenge&quot; to &quot;promote youth creativity, as well as an upcoming slam-dunk competition in China. The song was released at a press conference before the NBA All-Star Game on 20 February 2011. Chou released his eleventh studio album, &quot;Wow!&quot;, on 11 November 2011. The album received three nominations at the Golden Melody Awards and won the award for Best Album Packaging. His next studio album, &quot;Opus 12&quot;, was released on 28 December 2012. It became his seventh consecutive studio album to top the G-Music combo album chart in Taiwan, and received a platinum certification in Singapore in 2020.

To promote his album, Jay Chou launched his sixth concert tour, the Opus Jay World Tour, in May 2013. The opening concert of the tour took place at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai from 17–19 May 2013. Chou&#x27;s performance at the Allphones Arena in Sydney, Australia in April 2014 generated $1.4 million in revenue. Following the success of the Opus Jay World Tour, Chou revealed a follow-up concert leg named the Opus II Jay World Tour. The second leg commenced at the Shanghai Stadium on 2 May 2014, attracting close to 80,000 fans. His next studio album, &quot;Aiyo, Not Bad&quot;, was released on 26 December 2014. The record became his first to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; US World Albums chart and won Best Selling Digital Album of the Year at the QQ Music Awards and Miguhui Awards in 2015. In December 2015, the Opus Jay World Tour concluded after 76 stops and a total attendance of 1,800,000 people.

Chou&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;Jay Chou&#x27;s Bedtime Stories&quot;, was released on 24 June 2016. That same year, Chou and fellow Taiwanese recording artist A-Mei released the collaboration single &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t Be&quot; (不該), which was included on the album&#x27;s tracklist. The song won the 2016 Top 20 Golden Melody Awards in the Global Pop Music Gold List. One week after the release of Chou&#x27;s fourteenth album, the singer embarked on his seventh world tour, The Invincible World Tour. The tour opened with a four-day concert at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai from 30 June to 3 July, which saw a total attendance of 44,000 people. His concert at the Singapore National Stadium in Singapore on 3 September 2016 drew a crowd of 40,000 people.

=== 2017–2021: Concert tours and singles ===

Chou&#x27;s nine-day concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum in January 2017 attracted a total of 90,000 fans, while the concerts at the Beijing National Stadium on 25–26 August 2017, attracted 100,000 fans. The second leg of The Invincible World Tour commenced at the Singapore National Stadium on 6 January 2018, also drawing a crowd of 40,000. On 18 January 2018, Chou released the duet &quot;Waiting for You&quot; (等你下課) with Gary Yang. It entered the top five on the record charts in Malaysia and Singapore and was certified gold in the latter country. The content is about a young man who secretly fell in love with a girl. He regretted that he didn&#x27;t study well and couldn&#x27;t enter the same university with her. In order to wait for her to finish class, he rented a house near the girl&#x27;s residence, waited for her silently, played the piano and wrote a love letter. He just wanted to convey his mind to her, but he couldn&#x27;t find the time and way. He had to wait for the girl to finish class every day.

The Invincible World Tour concluded after 120 concerts in May 2019. Chou made his chart comeback after a three-year hiatus with his long-awaited new single &quot;Won&#x27;t Cry&quot;. The song, which features Mayday vocalist, Ashin, was released on 16 September 2019, and its music video has since been viewed over 22 million times on YouTube. The song was reported to have caused QQ Music, China&#x27;s biggest streaming platform, to crash on the day of its release. It additionally peaked at number one on the record charts in Singapore and Malaysia. To celebrate his 20th milestone year in the entertainment industry, his eighth world tour titled The Carnival World Tour was launched in Shanghai on 17 October 2019, with more stops to be announced. However, the tour was halted in January 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The single &quot;Mojito&quot; was released on 12 June 2020, becoming a viral sensation. The song, which effuses amorous feelings of Cuba with the name originating from the Cuban cocktail of the same name, sold more than 3 million digital downloads on the day of release, reportedly causing QQ Music to again crash.

=== 2022–present: &quot;Greatest Works of Art&quot; and global commercial success ===
On 15 July 2022, Chou released his fifteenth studio album titled &quot;Greatest Works of Art.&quot; The record was preceded by six singles released from 2018 to 2022—&quot;Waiting for You&quot; with Gary Yang, &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Love Me, It&#x27;s Fine&quot;, &quot;Won&#x27;t Cry&quot; with Mayday vocalist Ashin, &quot;Mojito&quot;, and the title track. The album saw commercial success worldwide; it was the best-selling album of 2022 globally in pure sales according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). Across all formats, the album reportedly sold over 7.2 million units. In China, the album sold five million units within one week and set a record for the highest first-week sales for an album worldwide, breaking the record previously held by Adele&#x27;s album &quot;25&quot; in the United States in 2015, which sold three million units.

Following the commercial success of &quot;Greatest Works of Art&quot;, Chou resumed the Carnival World Tour at the Singapore National Stadium on 17–18 December 2022, which was attended by a total of 60,000 people. Chou performed in mainland China for the first time since the pandemic in June 2023, playing a four-day concert in Haikou, Hainan, for a total of 154,600 people. The tour attracted 95,100 tourists from outside of the province, resulting in a significant increase in the city&#x27;s tourism. The Carnival Tour also boosted economic activities in other cities within mainland China such as Tianjin and Hohhot; both of which experienced a significant surge in tourism revenue following Chou&#x27;s concerts, each nearing a total of ¥3 billion. Chou and Gary Yang released a Christmas collaboration titled &quot;Christmas Star&quot; () on 21 December 2023, which was met with mixed reception.

==Artistry==
=== Musical styles ===

Chou&#x27;s music has been the center of much discussion across Chinese and other Sinophone-speaking regions around the world. This was for the reason that his music greatly and distinctively stood out from other mainstream Chinese popular musical artists given how varied his songs were at that time. What distinguished and separated Chou from the quintessential Chinese popular musical artist was that his pieces combined ancient themes with futuristic ones, including things like space ships, all while employing graphic storytelling skills to evoke vivid imagery to his audience. What also made Chou different was his enunciation, or lack thereof, whether rapping or singing, was also critiqued when listeners often found that they could not decipher the words sung until they looked up the lyrics. Critics referred to his singing as &quot;mumbling&quot;. This garnered a lot of attention and reporters often quiz Chou on his singing style. Chou defended this as his signature style to infuse the vocals with the music and &quot;make it blend&quot; well together. Chou also stated that he wants the listeners to look at the lyrics stating the lyrics written by Vincent Fang are very deep.

Chou&#x27;s compositions are loosely categorized as pop music. While many of his works fall into contemporary Western R&amp;B, rap, and rock genres, the term &quot;Chou Style&quot; () has been popularized to describe his trademark cross-cultural music and insistence on singing with slurred enunciation. The &quot;Taipei Times&quot; once described the meaning of &quot;Chou Style&quot;: &quot;In what has become the archetypal Chou style, Taiwan&#x27;s favorite son blends pop, rap, blues and a smorgasbord of esthetic elements of world music to create his dream-like never-never land...&quot;

Chou regularly fuses traditional Chinese instruments and Western popular musical styles such as R&amp;B or rock to form a new genre in what he calls or &quot;Zhongguo feng&quot; (), which literally means &quot;Chinese Style Music&quot;. Some of these fusion-based songs are written in the Pentatonic Scale as opposed to the more common seven-note scale (Diatonic scale) to accentuate a distinct East Asian musical style, where Chou&#x27;s most popular songs all at least retain some rudimentary elements of indigenous and traditional Han Chinese cultural and musical forms. Besides his own culture and Chinese culture, he also incorporated Spanish guitar in &quot;Red Imitation&quot; (), American techno/electronica in &quot;Herbalist&#x27;s Manual&quot; (), rap with subtle classical music undertones in &quot;Reverse Scales&quot; (), Blues style in &quot;Free Tutorial Video&quot; () and Bossanova style in &quot;Rosemary&quot; (), to name a few. Sound effects from everyday life are frequently woven into his music, such as bouncing ping pong balls, touch tone phone dialing, helicopter blades, dripping rain, and radio static noise (Musique concrète).

His formal musical training is evident by the use of classical textures in his compositions. For example, counterpoint was used in &quot;Perfection&quot; () and &quot;Sorry&quot; (), while polyphony can be found in &quot;The Wound That Ends War&quot; () and &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Chapter Seven&quot; (). Chou&#x27;s albums have been noted for the lack of change compared to his earlier works, yet he firmly stated that he will not alter his style: &quot;They say I&#x27;ve been standing still ... but this is the music I want, and I don&#x27;t see what I want by moving ahead.&quot; To demonstrate his point, he named his 2006 album &quot;Still Fantasy&quot; after his 2001 album &quot;Fantasy&quot;. His use of relaxed enunciation has been criticized as &quot;mumbling&quot; which he also insisted will not change; however, recently he has adopted clearer pronunciation for certain songs, particularly more traditional Chinese style songs, such as &quot;Faraway&quot; () which features Fei Yu-ching and &quot;Chrysanthemum Terrace&quot; ().

=== Lyrics ===
Chou is considered more of a singer-composer than a lyricist. Several &quot;regulars&quot; write the lyrics for most of his music, but the content and style is unified with his own personality and image, covering a diverse range of topics and ideas. Vincent Fang accounts for more than half of the lyrics in his albums, helping to establish an important element in Chou&#x27;s music: the use of meaningful, imagery- and emotionally rich lyrics, sometimes written in the form of poetry with reference to Chinese history or folklore. In addition to writing romantic hits, he also touches on war, the Bible, sports, and martial arts. Vivian Hsu is a singer herself and has helped with Chou&#x27;s earlier hits.

Chou himself has written lyrics for many ballads, but has also discussed societal ills such as drug addiction in &quot;Coward&quot; () and loss of the rural countryside to urbanization in &quot;Terrace Fields&quot; (). Domestic violence discussed in &quot;Dad, I&#x27;m Home&quot; () received a great deal of commotion since he was the first to bring up this taboo subject in Sanscript music. &quot;In the Name of Father&quot; detailing the cruelty and brutality of the violence, this song is not Jay&#x27;s personal experience. Jay describes the phenomenon of domestic violence in society, and wants to appeal the public pay more attention to domestic violence.

=== Chinese cultural elements ===
Chou leads a new trend of music which combines western musical elements and Chinese literature terminology. Because of this unique combination, he makes the subtle distinction between himself and other musicians by leading a musical style that incorporates elements of Chinese culture called &quot;Zhongguo feng&quot; () in the history of East Asian popular music. The success of his Western-Chinese musical combination is built on his marketing strategies and the musical elements involved in his works. In early 21st century, the People&#x27;s Republic of China was in an economic transition model. The new generation was looking for a consumption pop culture which would reflect individual uniqueness in the social circumstance. Chou has also successfully generated airtime on CCTV by fitting in with the mainland China&#x27;s political and cultural agenda by celebrating traditional Chinese cultural values.Elements of traditional Chinese culture incorporated into Chou&#x27;s music have contributed and galvanized his status within the realm of modern East Asian popular music. The blowing &quot;Zhongguo feng&quot; in his music leads a new trend of Chinese pop music that incorporates a vast amount of traditional Chinese components, rather than simply following a Western music format. Chou&#x27;s &quot;Zhongguo feng&quot; is highlighted in his lyrics and the use of traditional Chinese musical instruments in his music. The lyricist Vincent Fang has worked with Jay Chou since 2000, and Fang&#x27;s work is featured by addressing traditional elements of Chinese culture, such as poetry and Confucianism. His representative work &quot;Chrysanthemum Terrace&quot; (), released in 2006, shows a vast amount of cultural elements. In this work, Fang puts images which indicate certain traditional ideas to build an ancient monarchy setting. He uses chrysanthemum as a metaphor of love. In the line &quot;Chrysanthemums broken, scattered across the floor, your smile has faded&quot; (), as well with &quot;Blue and White Porcelain&quot; () and &quot;Orchid Pavilion&quot; ().

Chou also performs in a rhythm and blues style, but within this Western musical form, he has incorporated indigenous Han Chinese melodies, themes, and rhythms. His 2003 song &quot;East Wind Breaks&quot; (东风破; Dong Feng Po) features a typical Chinese melody performed in a Western-oriented R&amp;B style; its instrumentation also creates a Chinese atmosphere with the pipa (琵琶). In the lyrics, Chou expresses sadness and loneliness subtly, similar to traditional Chinese poetry. Chou also uses traditional Chinese musical instruments, combining traditional Chinese musical elements with Western popular musical forms.

== Collaborations ==
Chou&#x27;s career started as a songwriter for other Mandopop singers, a practice he would continue even after starting his own successful singing career. He frequently composed songs for prominent artists such as Jolin Tsai and Landy Wen, and occasionally for other singers like Coco Lee, S.H.E, Vivian Hsu, Fish Leong, Evonne Hsu, Annie Yi, A-Mei, Selina Ren, Leehom Wang, Will Liu, Will Pan, Show Lo, Valen Hsu, and Cantopop stars Edmond Leung, Twins, TPE48, Jordan Chan, Edison Chen, Karen Mok, Leo Ku, Gigi Leung, Eason Chan, Tzuyu, and Joey Yung, as well as a one-time collaboration with Howard Su. He has also written for singers outside of his generation — over one dozen songs for his mentor Jacky Wu, Taiwanese singer Jody Chiang, as well for Cantopop singers Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok, and Kenny Bee.

== Film career ==
Chou formally entered the film industry in 2005 with the release of the movie &quot;Initial D&quot;. He has since acted in three other movies, directed one film and more than a dozen music videos. Chou, who once said &quot;I live because of music&quot;, ventured into movies because he felt the need for a new challenge. As fans have grown concerned that movies will compromise his music career, Chou has repeatedly reassured that movies are a source of inspiration and not a distraction; at the same time, he realizes the need to balance both careers and maintain his place in the music field to garner the continued support of fans.

=== Acting ===

Entry into acting was an unexpected move for Chou. His high school English teacher thought he was capable of very few facial expressions, and the director of &quot;Hidden Track&quot; (2003, a movie in which Chou had a cameo role) said that his strong individualistic personality will not make him a good actor. In 2005, Chou&#x27;s first role as the lead actor in 头文字D &quot;Initial D&quot; served two purposes: to launch his acting debut, and to increase his exposure to Japanese audiences. This film is based on the Japanese comic &quot;Initial D&quot;, where Chou played Takumi Fujiwara, a gifted touge racer who is quiet and rarely shows expression. Some reviewers criticized his bland acting while others felt he performed naturally, but only because the character&#x27;s personality closely mirrored his own. His performance in &quot;Initial D&quot; won him Best Newcomer Actor in Golden Horse Awards and Hong Kong Film Awards. Chou&#x27;s second film was &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; (2006). As a supporting character, he drew much of the attention of Chinese reporters; Chou&#x27;s involvement in this movie was announced in its own press conference, separate from the meeting held for Chow Yun-fat, Gong Li, and the other actors. Chou portrayed Prince Jai, the ambitious second eldest prince and general of the Imperial army whose personality epitomizes Xiao (孝), the Chinese virtue of filial piety. In this internationally released film, North American audiences saw Chou for the first time. According to Chinese movie critics, comments about his acting ranged from &quot;lacks complexity&quot; to &quot;acceptable&quot;, but was critically praised by Western reviewers. His performance in &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; was nominated Best Supporting Actor in the Hong Kong Film Awards. In the 2008 film &quot;Kung Fu Dunk&quot;, Chou portrayed a kung fu student and dunking prodigy, and the film earned over ¥100 million (US$14.7 million).

Chou portrayed Kato in &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, directed by Michel Gondry and released in January 2011, after Hong Kong actor Stephen Chow withdrew from the project; the film grossed over $228 million worldwide. MTV Networks&#x27; NextMovie.com named him one of the &quot;Breakout Stars to Watch for in 2011&quot;. In May 2011, Chou started filming for a new movie, &quot;The Viral Factor&quot; directed by Dante Lam and starred various well known artistes such as Nicholas Tse. The movie was released in theatres over Asia on 17 January 2012. With most of the scenes shot in the Middle Eastern and Southeast Asian countries, earlier filming process has been slightly disrupted due to political conflicts in the Middle East.

Chou co-starred with English actor and former &quot;Harry Potter&quot; superstar Daniel Radcliffe in &quot;Now You See Me 2&quot;, which was released in June 2016. In 2018, it was announced that Chou joined the cast of Vin Diesel&#x27;s fourth XXX film. In 2021, Chou was briefly starred in Nezha, where he was the executive producer for the film. With a budget reportedly up to more than 400 million yuan ($61.8 million), the film used some expensive racing cars for the action sequences, accounting for about 80% of the entire content. Directed by Chen Yi-xian, the film also stars Tsao Yu-ning, Van Fan, and Alan Kuo. Chou and pop idol Wang Junkai show up in the film in cameo appearances.

=== Directing ===
Chou acquired his first directing experience in 2004 through music videos. He initially experimented with a song by the group Nan Quan Mama titled &quot;Home&quot; () where he was involved throughout the entire process from research to editing. After learning the difficulties of being a director, he refused to direct again even at the request of his record company. However, his interest resurfaced again as he directed music videos for 4 of the 12 songs in own album &quot;November&#x27;s Chopin&quot; in 2005, and later television advertisements. By 2006, he had taken responsibility for the storyboard, directing, and editing of music videos for all his songs. It is unclear how the public appraises his work, since music videos are rarely the subject of critical review; however, director Zhang Yimou said that Chou&#x27;s directing abilities may surpass his own in the future, after viewing several of Chou&#x27;s music videos.

In February 2007, Chou began directing his first film &quot;Secret&quot;. The script written by Chou was inspired by his relationship with a high school girlfriend, with a plot focused on music, love, and family. He stars as the lead actor of the film with Gwei Lun-mei as the female lead, and Hong Kong veteran actor Anthony Wong as Chou&#x27;s father. Despite previous experience in filming music videos, Chou admits that movies are more challenging due to storyline and time constraints. This movie was released in July 2007. In 2013, Jay Chou released his second directorial film, a musical drama titled &quot;The Rooftop&quot;. It generated a more muted response compared to his directorial debut, the box office receipts in mainland China on the other hand were more positive.

== Other works ==
=== Book: &quot;Grandeur de D Major&quot;===
Chou published his first book titled &quot;Grandeur de D Major&quot; () on 25 November 2004. This 200-page book features a prologue written by his family, friends, and co-workers; the main section is a compilation of his personal attitudes, philosophies, and recollections of childhood experiences along with pictures from his music videos, many of which have never been released; and lastly, a list of the artist&#x27;s major awards, musical and lyrical compositions, and discography. For the usually low-profile singer, this book revealed his personality and convictions that has served as the basis of his musical and public image. He demonstrated a strong appreciation of family values with an especially deep connection with his mother and maternal grandmother. His confidence and dedication towards music is evident as he dedicated 2 out of 7 chapters to music: the current state of the industry, his composition methodology, and the importance of individualism to his success in music. This pride is contrasted against his modesty and self-assessed naïveté about many aspects in life, particularly regarding relationships and marriage.

=== Endorsements ===
Chou has been a spokesperson for popular brands such as Pepsi (2002–2007), Panasonic (2001–2005), Motorola (since 2006), M-Zone/China Mobile (since 2003), Levi&#x27;s (2004–2005), Deerhui (sporting goods, since 2003), Metersbonwe Group (casual wear, since 2003), Colgate (2004–2005), popular computer game &quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot; (2002), and science and nature magazine &quot;National Geographic&quot; (2005). To maximize the celebrity branding effect, advertisements are nearly always linked to his music and TV commercials are occasionally directed by him. He acted as the tourism ambassador for Malaysia in 2003. In April 2008, Jay signed with Sprite and collaborated with artistes such as Angela Chang and JJ Lin in commercials. He also did a Sprite commercial with NBA player Kobe Bryant and specially wrote a song named &quot;Battle of the Incomparable&quot; that also featured Bryant for the commercial. In June 2011, Chou expanded his area of endorsement into the field of technology, becoming the designer and spokesperson of the &quot;N43SL Jay Chou Edition&quot; laptop of ASUS Computers. The laptop is most notable for its lid design, sound system, start-up and shut-down tones, and a unique &quot;J&quot; font for its key. All of which, except for the sound system, are designed and composed by Jay himself. In 2015, Chou formally endorsed Luxgen, a Taiwanese automaker.

=== Philanthropy ===
Outside of his traditional ventures in business and entertainment, Chou is also an ardent philanthropist. He has been the spokesperson for &quot;Angel Heart Foundation&quot; since 2012, a non-profit charity for children with intellectual disability. In 2013, he hosted a voluntary concert for them.

In 2014, Jay accepted the Ice Bucket Challenge from Andy Lau, and also donated NT$100,000 to Taiwanese ALS Foundation, and also donated NT$2 million in the aftermath of 2014 Kaohsiung gas explosions. He also attended the charity event from Fubon Charity Foundation, and 
has been the ambassador for the charity, which helps school children with disabilities, hardship or giving children living in poverty a scholarship for their education. He had already donated NT$970 million in the last 5 years, sponsoring over 300 of the thousand benefactors, and would extend the offer by 5 years, and opened 300 more scholarships, and donated a lump sum of NT$10.8 million in the next 5 years worth NT$2.16 million each year. In June 2014, he also went on tour with Will Liu to visit many schoolchildren in remote areas of Taiwan. Jay&#x27;s second tour is scheduled in August 2015, two months after he officially became the spokesperson for the scholarship plan.

=== J Gaming ===
During the mid to late 2010s, Chou made forays in his business career by venturing into the eSporting sphere. In 2016, he purchased the eSports (League of Legends) team Taipei Assassins and renamed it J Gaming. His role is limited to being a backing investor and team owner despite himself holding the titular role of a &#x27;captain/leader,&#x27; as he will only partake in celebrity matches, and would not involve in the day-to-day operations and coaching of the team.

In 2017, Chou spent about 18 million RMB to construct a Jay eSports building in Shenzhen, which provided updated computer devices and the streaming areas for eSports players in China. More importantly, if Chou decides to hold more and more eSports events in the Jay eSports building, which is helpful for the germination of the eSports industry in China.

== Public image ==
Despite living under continual media scrutiny, Chou&#x27;s public image has changed little over the years as he emphasizes individuality as his &quot;personal philosophy&quot;. In his music, this is also evident as he fuses Chinese and Western styles and explores topics unconventional for a pop singer, which have been described as &quot;authentic&quot; and &quot;revolutionary&quot;. The media describes a hard-working perfectionist with clear self-direction who is occasionally regarded as competitive and a &quot;control freak&quot;.

There is a misunderstanding about his nickname &quot;President Chou&quot; (), used by both the press and fans to underscore his domineering personality and impact on East Asian popular music, but also points at his musical talent. It also points to the fact that he is the CEO, spokesperson and chairperson of his many business ventures like clothing lines and his own talent agency (JVR Music). Yet the origin of this nickname emerges from his fever of collecting antiques as the word &quot;&quot; comes from &quot;antique&quot; in Chinese (), and according to JJ Lin, they both like to collect and drive antique cars. When he initiated Nan Quan Mama, it was also based on his pen name in his high school years, and the band&#x27;s name was also dedicated to his mother. In fact, Nanquan is an actual style of martial arts from south of the Yangtze River. As Jay was influenced by action movies, he also wrote songs about martial arts, even when he had no formal training in any martial arts discipline.

Outside of music, Chou is reported as shy, quiet, modest, and views filial piety as &quot;the most important thing&quot;. In line with his aim to present a positive image, he is a non-smoker and non-drinker and does not go to nightclubs. Government officials and educators in East Asia have awarded him for his exemplary behaviour, designated him a spokesperson in the youth-empowerment project &quot;Young Voice&quot; in 2005 and an anti-depression campaign in 2007. His lyrics for two songs have been incorporated into the school syllabus to inspire motivational and filial attitudes. In November 2007, Chou was criticized by some for attending the funeral of Taiwanese gang leader Chen Chi-li to console Chen&#x27;s son Baron Chen, whom Chou met while filming &quot;Kung Fu Dunk&quot;. In 2011 Chou performed on the New Year&#x27;s Gala program on China&#x27;s Central Television.

=== Relationship with the media and paparazzi ===
Chou has been known for his tense relationship with and strong dislike of paparazzi. In 2005, He released a diss track, &quot;Besieged From All Sides&quot; (), targeting paparazzi and tabloids. In 2007, he released a song, &quot;Not Good Enough For You ()&quot;, about a relationship that broke down due to intrusive media attention. Through his career, he had multiple physical confrontations with paparazzi, though his attitude over them has mellowed in recent years. To discourage unsolicited photography, Chou is known to photograph the paparazzi who follow him.

Despite his aversion to paparazzi, Chou acknowledges that not all media attention is unwelcome. Coverage by international media such as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and Reuters help ascertain his influence on mainstream culture. An editorial written by Kerry Brown of Chatham House named Chou as one of China&#x27;s 50 most influential figures in 21st century, one of only three singers on a list dominated by politicians and corporate owners. At the end of 2009, he was included on JWT&#x27;s annual list of 100 Things to Watch in 2010.

=== Fanbase ===

It is difficult to estimate the size and global spread of Chou&#x27;s fanbase. Chou&#x27;s fanbase originated from Taiwan and grew extensively to other Mandarin-speaking regions. The Sinophone-speaking populations of China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, and Malaysia make up a significant percentage of Chou&#x27;s fans. Despite rampant piracy issues in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, every album Chou has released so far has surpassed sales in excess of 2 million. According to Baidu, the most popular internet search engine in China, Chou was the number one searched male entertainer in 2002, 2005, 2006, and 2007.

Currently, Chou remains largely unknown outside of the Asia-Pacific, except in cities throughout the Western world that host large Overseas Chinese populations such as Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, Toronto, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane. He has held concerts in major venues such as the Acer Arena (Sydney – 3 July 2009), HP Pavilion at San Jose (San Jose – 31 December 2010), Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena (Los Angeles – 8 January 2011), MGM Grand (Las Vegas – 25 December 2002), Rogers Arena (Vancouver – 23 December 2010), Shrine Auditorium (Los Angeles – 18 December 2004), Galen Center (Los Angeles – 24 December 2007), the Air Canada Centre (Toronto – 18 December 2008), and Wembley Arena (London – 17–18 March 2017). His intention to increase his prominence in the Western world beyond Chinese audiences is clear. In 2006, Chou composed and sang the theme song for &quot;Fearless&quot;, a movie released in major theatres in most English-speaking countries, though the impact to his fame has been minimal. His role in &quot;Curse of the Golden Flower&quot; (limited release) marks his acting debut in North America. Despite having a supporting but important role in the story&#x27;s plot, the North American version of the official posters only featured a view of his back, greatly contrasting the East Asian versions where his face and name were clear and placed between the leading actor and actress. Although Chou is still far from being well known English-speaking audiences in the Western world, this movie nonethless brought him international exposure. Chou gained further exposure to Western audiences in his starring role as crimefighter Kato in January 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===
From 1998, Chou dated singer Devin Wu (formerly known as Peggy Wu), his labelmate at Jacky Wu’s Alfa Music, for over a year until a third party intervened. In 2010, Devin Wu told &quot;Next Magazine&quot; that she lost her virginity to Chou when she was 16 while he 18.

Chou was rumored to have a relationship with Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai with the former being featured on Tsai&#x27;s song &quot;Can&#x27;t Speak Clearly&quot;, which appeared on her fourth studio album &quot;Lucky Number&quot; (2001). In December 2001, Tsai and Chou were first spotted dining at an izakaya in Shinjuku, Japan. Although they did not admit to their relationship, it was an open secret in those years.

In February 2005, Chou was spotted shopping with Taiwanese news presenter Patty Hou in Shibuya, Japan. After that, Tsai deliberately avoided meeting Chou and Hou during public events, while Jacky Wu, Chou’s former boss, confirmed Chou and Tsai had been dating. This revelation further compounded the feud between Chou and Wu, which began over Wu&#x27;s sale of Alfa Music. In June 2010, Tsai and Chou made amends, and Tsai appeared as a special guest at Chou&#x27;s concert in Taipei to much public fanfare. In July 2013, when being interviewed by Taiwanese TV host Matilda Tao, Tsai admitted for the first time that she had been in a relationship with Chou, and that she broke up with him after he cheated on her.

In November 2014, Chou confirmed his relationship with model Hannah Quinlivan, who first met Chou when she was 14 and had been working as his employee as a clothing shop assistant since 2007. The couple had been dating since 2010, and married on 17 January 2015, one day before Chou&#x27;s birthday. A separate private wedding ceremony open to friends and family occurred on 9 February in Taipei. A third reception, this time in Australia, was held in March. According to Chou&#x27;s official Facebook page, the couple has been registered for marriage since July 2014. The couple has three children: a daughter born in 2015, a son born in 2017, and a daughter born in 2022.

=== Religion ===
Chou became an Evangelical Protestant Christian as his wife, his mother and some of his friends, including Will Liu and Vanness Wu, are Protestants. He was baptised in 2012.

=== Disease ===
Chou suffers from ankylosing spondylitis, which exempted him from Taiwan’s military service in 1999. In early 2006, he was accused of evading military service by using falsified medical records and was subsequently investigated by prosecutors. After reviewing Chou’s medical records and questioning five medical professionals, the prosecutors concluded that Chou was legitimately exempted due to his medical condition. The case was closed in late 2006 with no charges filed. While declining to disclose the identity of the whistleblower, prosecutors also clarified that that it was not a member of the entertainment industry, as Chou had suspected.

== Accolades ==

From the launch of his music career in 2000, Chou has won singer-songwriter and producer awards in Asia. The highly coveted Golden Melody Awards in Taiwan awarded &quot;Best Album&quot; for his debut CD &quot;Jay&quot; (2000) in 2001, and five awards (including &quot;Best Album&quot;, &quot;Best Composer&quot;, and &quot;Best Producer&quot;) in the following year for the album &quot;Fantasy&quot; (2001). However, failure to win &quot;Best Album&quot; for three consecutive years has left him disheartened with award ceremonies. Although he continues to win more than 20 awards per year from various organizations in Asia, Chou has stated he will rely more on album sales as an indicator of his music&#x27;s quality and popularity. In 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008, he was awarded Best-Selling Chinese Artist by World Music Awards for the albums &quot;Common Jasmin Orange&quot;, 依然范特西 &quot;Still Fantasy&quot; and &quot;On the Run&quot;.

Jay Chou scored strong radio and video airplay in Italy with his track &quot;Nunchucks&quot;, in 2002. Chou dominated the 12th annual Channel V Music Awards ceremony, which was held 11 January 2006, at Queen Elizabeth Stadium in Hong Kong. In the Taiwan/Hong Kong category, the Sony BMG Hong Kong-signed artist was named best male singer, most popular male singer and best singer/songwriter. Chou also collected the best music video award and received one of the best song of the year awards, both for &quot;Night Song.&quot;

Taiwanese vocalist Jay Chou was named the best Asian artist at the eighth annual CCTV/MTV Music Awards, held 12 October 2006, at the Beijing Exhibition Centre Auditorium.

<text>USS &quot;Rogers&quot; (DD-876) was a of the United States Navy. She was named for three brothers — Jack Ellis Rogers Jr., Charles Ethbert Rogers, and Edward Keith Rogers — killed in action aboard during the Battle of Tassafaronga in the Solomon Islands on 30 November 1942.

&quot;Rogers&quot;″s keel was laid down on 3 June 1944 by Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas. The ship was launched on 20 November 1944, sponsored by the Mother, Mrs. Josie Viola Taylor Rogers, wife of Jack Ellis Rogers Sr., and commissioned on 26 March 1945.

==Service history==

===World War II and afterwards, 1945–1949===
Following shakedown off Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, &quot;Rogers&quot; was converted to a picket ship at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia. After further training in the Atlantic and Caribbean, &quot;Rogers&quot; transited the Panama Canal and touched at San Diego before reaching Pearl Harbor on 4 August 1945.

With the termination of hostilities, &quot;Rogers&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 17 August for Tokyo Bay where she arrived on 31 August via Eniwetok and Iwo Jima. On 1 September she stood out of Tokyo Bay to join a fast carrier task group and commence her routine duties as a member of the 7th Fleet. Through the decade she rotated to the Far East for duty with that fleet on a regular schedule, and in 1949 assisted in evacuating American nationals from China.

&quot;Rogers&quot; participated in the &quot;Operation Sandstone&quot; atomic bomb tests in Eniwetok Atoll in 1948. On 18 March 1949, she was reclassified as a radar picket destroyer (DDR) after a height finder radar and more communication equipment had been added and her torpedo tubes had been removed.

===Korean War, 1950–1953===
During 1951 and 1952, &quot;Rogers&quot; served as a unit of Task Forces 77, 95, and 96 and participated in shore bombardment, blockading, and patrol missions in Korean waters. During this period &quot;Rogers&quot; also served as &quot;lifeguard&quot; destroyer for two Presidents: for President Truman&#x27;s flight to Wake Island for his conference with General Douglas MacArthur in 1950 and for President-elect Eisenhower on his return from the Far East in 1952.

===WestPac deployments, 1953–1962===
After fighting stopped in Korea, &quot;Rogers&quot; alternated west coast tours with WestPac deployment. In 1954, she helped in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands.

By 1960 &quot;Rogers&quot; had made over a dozen six to nine-month cruises to the Far East. After 1st Fleet operations off the west coast, &quot;Rogers&quot; again deployed in January 1962 to WestPac where she operated with carrier groups, on Formosa patrol, and participated in a major allied amphibious exercise. &quot;Rogers&quot; returned to the 1st Fleet and on the evening of 12 November, successfully recovered a pilot from the aircraft carrier , who had ejected from his aircraft into a dense fog off the coast of southern California.

===Vietnam, 1963–1969===
In June 1963, after 18 years in the Pacific, &quot;Rogers&quot; departed San Diego for the east coast and FRAM I modernization at Charleston, South Carolina. On 30 July 1963 she was reclassified from DDR-876 to DD-876. In May 1964 she returned to the Pacific Fleet. During the summer of 1965, &quot;Rogers&quot; visited San Francisco, Puget Sound, and Hawaii as part of the Pacific Midshipman Training Squadron. One year later she was operating off Vietnam in the Tonkin Gulf serving on Search and Rescue and shore bombardment missions from August 1966, returning to San Diego in August 1967, she operated with the 1st Fleet off the west coast of the United States until deploying again to the western Pacific in September 1967. In mid-November, she was operating in the Gulf of Tonkin, and in April 1968 returned to San Diego, California.

Again operating off the west coast of the United States for the balance of the year, &quot;Rogers&quot; deployed to the Far East in January 1969. En route she earned the Meritorious Unit Commendation for action in Hawaiian waters on 14 January coming alongside the port quarter of the aircraft carrier with six fire hoses trained on the raging flight-deck fire while exposed to flying shrapnel from exploding bombs. After spending some of her time in the Far East off Vietnam, she returned to San Diego on 6 July. After a year of operations with the First Fleet, &quot;Rogers&quot; sailed from San Diego for another Far East cruise. Following five months of service in the western Pacific, she returned to San Diego on 16 December.

===WestPac deployments, 1970–1974===
At the completion of another spring of west coast operations, &quot;Rogers&quot; headed back to WestPac, departing from San Diego on 29 June 1972. She returned to San Diego on 22 December and spent the next year on the Pacific coast of the United States engaged initially in normal operations. Later, in early April 1972, she entered Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard for regular overhaul. Overhaul was completed by 28 August and she left Hunter&#x27;s Point for various trials and refresher training, which continued until mid-December. On 18 December, she sailed for Subic Bay, but had to return to San Diego three days later because of a medical emergency. She departed San Diego the same day, 21 December, and arrived in Subic Bay on 29 January 1973. Returning to San Diego on 12 June 1973, &quot;Rogers&quot; operated along the west coast into 1974.
&quot;Rogers&quot; was on the gun-line again from January 1973 through April 1973 at the moment President Nixon declared cease fire. &quot;Rogers&quot; fired the last shot of the Vietnam War.

===Reserve training, 1974–1980===
In 1974 she changed homeports to Swan Island in Portland, Oregon, and became part of Destroyer Squadron 37. &quot;Rogers&quot; was tasked with training U.S. Navy reserves in the Portland area. &quot;Rogers&quot; also made many trips to Seattle, San Francisco, Esquimalt Harbour, Nanoose Bay and San Diego to train US Navy Reservists. She performed these duties until 1980 when she was decommissioned and sold to South Korea the next year.

===Decommissioning and transfer to Korea===
&quot;Rogers&quot; was decommissioned on 19 February 1981 and was struck from the Navy List on 1 October 1980. Transferred to the Republic of Korea on 11 August 1981, the destroyer served as ROKS &quot;Jeonju&quot; (DD-925) until decommissioned on 31 December 1999. The destroyer is now a museum ship at Dangjin Marine Tourism Organization (Sapgyo Hamsang Park) in the city of Dangjin-Gun, Chung Nam Province.

<text>Imphal (; , ) is the capital city of the Indian state of Manipur. The metropolitan centre of the city contains the ruins of Kangla Palace (officially known as Kangla Fort), the royal seat of the former Kingdom of Manipur, surrounded by a moat. Spread over parts of the districts of Imphal West and Imphal East, the former contains the majority of the city&#x27;s area and population. Imphal is part of the Smart Cities Mission under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Being a mega commercial hub, Imphal is known for its weaving, brass-ware, bronze-ware, and other cottage industries. Meitei language (officially known as Manipuri language) is the most widely spoken language in the city.

&quot;INS Imphal&quot;, the third ship of the &quot;Visakhapatnam&quot;-class stealth guided missile destroyer of the Indian Navy, was named in recognition of the Indian soldiers who fought in Battle of Imphal during World War II, and is the first Indian Navy Ship (INS) named after a city in Northeast India.

==Etymology==
Imphal is derived from two words: &quot;Yum&quot; meaning house and &quot;Phal&quot; meaning &quot;plenty&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot;. In old Manipuri language, &quot;yum&quot; is also spelt as &quot;&quot;im&quot;.&quot; Even today, Imphal is occasionally pronounced as &quot;yum-phal.&quot;

Initially ruled by King Khaba, Imphal was later ruled by the Pakhangba leaders. The clan of the Ningthouja tribe originated then. The Ningthouja tribe quickly expanded and dominated the region in politics and war. Kangla Palace was built by King Khagemba and his son Khunjaoba. The palace was later destroyed by the British during the Anglo-Manipur War. During the reign of Maharaja Bhagyachandra, there were a number of Burmese invasions. However, the kingdom survived with the help of Maharaj Gambhir Singh.

Imphal remained peaceful until 1891, when there were internal differences in the royal family. The British sent J.W. Quinton to help but the situation only grew worse and Senapati Tikendrajit was hanged. The autocratic British behaviour made people angry. This resulted in the 1891 Anglo-Manipur War, which the British won.

The Battle of Imphal took place between March and July 1944, during World War II. The Japanese had invaded Imphal to destroy Allied forces and then invade India, but they were defeated and forced to retreat. The attack made the British realise the militarily strategic position of Imphal.

<doc id="543685" wikidata="Q1174104" url="?curid=543685" title="David Crombie">
<text>David Edward Crombie (born April 24, 1936) is a former Canadian academic and politician who served as the 56th mayor of Toronto from 1972 to 1978. Crombie was elected to Parliament following his tenure as mayor. A member of the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party, he served as minister of national health and welfare from 1979 to 1980, minister of Indian affairs and northern development from 1984 to 1986, and secretary of state for Canada from 1986 to 1988.

==Early life==
Crombie was born in Swansea, then a village west of Toronto, the son of Vera Edith (Beamish) and Norman Davis Crombie. He was a lecturer in politics and urban affairs at Ryerson in the 1960s when he became involved in Toronto&#x27;s urban reform movement. At the time, the city had a very pro-development city council that allowed a great deal of demolition of older buildings, including houses, to make way for the construction of apartment blocks, office towers, and highways (see Spadina Expressway). Crombie, along with John Sewell and other urban reformers, became a leader in a grassroots movement that favoured curtailing development in favour of improving social services and prioritizing community interests.

==Municipal politics==

Crombie was elected to Toronto&#x27;s city council in 1970, and became Mayor of Toronto in 1972, ushering in an era of socially responsible urban development inspired by thinkers such as Jane Jacobs. Crombie was the first mayor who represented the reform movement of Toronto politics, and his policies differed sharply from those of the Old Guard who preceded him.

=== Mayor of Toronto ===
Much of Crombie&#x27;s time as mayor was spent trying to rein in the development industry. He initially imposed a 45-foot (13.7 m) limit on all new constructions, but this was overturned by the Ontario Municipal Board. Crombie then put forward a new official plan that imposed varying height restrictions across the city, and this was upheld by the board.

The Spadina Expressway had been halted by premier Bill Davis in 1971, but Davis continued to support the construction of the Allen Expressway in the north. Crombie attempted but failed to have it halted. He was more successful in countering plans for the Scarborough Expressway; all work was halted during Crombie&#x27;s term, leading to its eventual cancellation.

Crombie also opposed the traditional pattern of demolishing poorer neighbourhoods and replacing them with housing projects. The plans to redevelop areas such as Trefann Court, Kensington Market, and Cabbagetown ended under Crombie. Instead, he oversaw the creation of the St. Lawrence neighbourhood, an area of mid-rise, mixed-use, mixed-income buildings that followed Jane Jacobs&#x27;s vision of urban planning.

Crombie was re-elected in 1974 and 1976 with large majorities. Because of his great public appeal and his height of only , he was repeatedly described in the media as the city&#x27;s &quot;tiny, perfect mayor&quot;.

==Federal politics==
He left City Hall in 1978 to move to federal politics, winning a by-election as a Progressive Conservative candidate that gave him a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. Crombie served as Minister of Health and Welfare in the short-lived minority government of Prime Minister Joe Clark which was elected in 1979 but lost power the next year.

Crombie stood as a candidate at the 1983 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. He finished fourth. After Mulroney led Conservatives to power in the 1984 election, Crombie became Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, and later Secretary of State and Minister of Multiculturalism.

=== Royal Commission on the Future of the Toronto Waterfront ===
Frustrated in Ottawa, as a Red Tory in an increasingly conservative government, Crombie decided not to run in the 1988 election and returned to urban affairs as head of the royal commission on the Future of Toronto&#x27;s waterfront (1988–92). He authored ground-breaking reports including Watershed&#x27; and Regeneration, which described new integrated approaches to sustainable planning. The Provincial Government appointed Crombie as head of a provincial agency, the Waterfront Regeneration Trust Agency (1992-1999) to implement the 83 recommendations made in the final report, Regeneration. Among these recommendations was the creation of a waterfront trail. Today the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail extends from Quebec to Sault Ste Marie along Canada&#x27;s Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River. In 1999, Crombie founded the Waterfront Regeneration Trust, as a charity, to continue the work of the provincial agency, and serves on the Board. In addition to leading work on the creation of the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail, the charity manages a fund for the protection and restoration of the Rouge Valley, now part of the Rouge National Urban Park. Crombie tried to find an alternative to Red Hill Creek Expressway but the Hamilton city council dismissed his compromise proposal out of hand as being insufficient.

=== First Nations and Inuit health reform ===
In September 1979, Crombie, a liberal-minded reformer, as Minister of Health and Welfare under the Conservative government Prime Minister Joe Clark, issued a statement representing &quot;current Federal Government practice and policy in the field of Indian health.&quot; Crombie declared that the &quot;Federal Government is committed to joining with Indian representatives in a fundamental review of issues involved in Indian health when Indian representatives have developed their position, and the policy emerging from that review could supersede this policy&quot;. In the previous year, Indian bands and organizations such as the Union of B.C. Chiefs, the Native Brotherhood, and the United Native Nations engaged in intense lobbying for Indians to control delivery of health services in their own communities and for the repeal of restrictive service &quot;guidelines introduced in September 1978, to correct abuses in health delivery, and to deal with the environmental health hazards of mercury and fluoride pollution affecting particular communities.&quot; Crombie appointed Gary Goldthorpe, as commissioner of the federal inquiry (known as the Goldthorpe Inquiry) into &quot;alleged abuses in medical care delivery at Alert Bay, British Columbia.&quot; In 1979 Justice Thomas Berger, who headed the royal commission dealing with Indian and Inuit healthcare, recommended to Crombie that there be greater consultation with Indians and Inuit regarding the delivery of healthcare programs and that an &quot;annual sum of $950,000 was allocated for distribution by the National Indian Brotherhood to develop health consultation structures within the national Indian community.&quot; Crombie&#x27;s successor as Liberal Minister of Health and Welfare, Monique Begin, adopted Berger&#x27;s recommendations, ushering in the beginning of a change in the way in which health delivery.

==Later career==
Crombie was appointed Ryerson&#x27;s first chancellor in 1994 when the polytechnic was granted university status. He served in that role until 1999.

Throughout the 1990s, he served in various advisory capacities to city and provincial governments relating to urban issues in the Toronto area. In 2007 he retired as CEO of the Canadian Urban Institute. In April 2008, the Toronto District School Board selected Crombie to negotiate a solution to keep unfunded school swimming pools open to the public. In 2014 he publicly opposed plans by the federally run Toronto Port Authority to lengthen runways at Billy Bishop Airport on the Toronto Islands to enable Porter Airlines to expand with jet planes.

On May 13, 2004, Crombie was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2012, he was made a member of the Order of Ontario. In 2013, he was inducted into the Canadian Disability Hall of Fame. Crombie serves on the Governors&#x27; Council of the Toronto Public Library Foundation, the Honorary Council for the Loran Scholars Foundation, and the boards of CivicAction and the Planet in Focus Foundation. In addition, Crombie is a member of the Patron&#x27;s Council at Dying with Dignity Canada. He also serves on the advisory boards of the Ryerson Image Centre and CARP Canada.

A park named after Crombie runs from Jarvis Street to Berkeley Street, in a formerly industrial area, that was converted to housing.

==Personal life==
Crombie is the father of two daughters, Robin and Carrie, and actor Jonathan Crombie, who starred in three &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; TV series. Jonathan died in New York on April 15, 2015, of a brain hemorrhage at age 48. His organs were donated, he was cremated and his ashes returned to Canada.

<text>The Battle of Tassafaronga, sometimes referred to as the Fourth Battle of Savo Island or in Japanese sources as the , was a nighttime naval battle that took place on 30 November 1942 between United States Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy warships during the Guadalcanal campaign. The battle took place in Ironbottom Sound near Tassafaronga Point on Guadalcanal.

In the battle, a US force of five cruisers and four destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright intercepted eight Japanese destroyers attempting to deliver food to their forces on Guadalcanal. The US destroyers waited four minutes after radar contact for permission to launch torpedoes and missed the optimal firing position; the torpedoes all missed, and the destroyers retired. The US cruisers opened fire and sank one destroyer. The muzzle flash exposed the US cruisers&#x27; positions. Under the command of Rear Admiral Raizō Tanaka, Japanese destroyers quickly launched Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedoes, sinking one US cruiser and heavily damaging three others. The rest of Tanaka&#x27;s force escaped undamaged but failed to complete the intended supply mission.

Rear Admiral Samuel J. Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command, considers this battle and the Battle of Savo Island to be two of the worst defeats in US naval history, behind only Pearl Harbor.

==Background==

===Guadalcanal campaign===

On 7 August 1942 Allied forces landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and the Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands. The landings were meant to deny the Japanese access to bases that they could use to threaten supply routes between the US and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of neutralizing the major Japanese base at Rabaul while also supporting the Allied New Guinea campaign. The landings began the six-month Guadalcanal campaign.

The 2,000 to 3,000 Japanese personnel on the islands were taken by complete surprise, and by nightfall on 8 August, the 11,000 Allied troops, under the command of Lieutenant General Alexander Vandegrift, secured Tulagi and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal, named &quot;Henderson Field&quot; by the Allies. Allied aircraft operating from Henderson were called the &quot;Cactus Air Force&quot; (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the US Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Reinforcements over the next two months increased the number of US troops at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal to more than 20,000.

In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army&#x27;s 17th Army, a corps-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake, the task of retaking the island. The first units of the 17th Army began to arrive there on August 19.

Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were rarely able to use large, slow transport ships or barges to deliver troops and supplies to the island; instead, they used warships based at Rabaul and the Shortland Islands to carry their forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships, mainly light cruisers and destroyers from the Eighth Fleet under the command of Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, were usually able to make the round trip down &quot;The Slot&quot; to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers&#x27; heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high-speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; by Allied forces and &quot;Rat Transportation&quot; by the Japanese.

The Japanese attempted several times between August and November 1942 to recapture Henderson Field and drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal, to no avail. The last attempt by the Japanese to deliver significant additional forces to the island failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal of 12–15 November.

On 26 November Japanese Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura took command of the new Eighth Area Army at Rabaul. The command encompassed both Hyakutake&#x27;s 17th Army in the Solomons and the 18th Army in New Guinea. One of Imamura&#x27;s first priorities upon assuming command was the continuation of the attempts to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal. However, the Allied attempt to take Buna in New Guinea changed Imamura&#x27;s priorities; it was considered a more severe threat to Rabaul, and Imamura postponed further major reinforcement efforts to Guadalcanal to concentrate on the situation in New Guinea.

===Supply crisis===
The combination of threats from CAF aircraft, US Navy PT boats stationed at Tulagi, and a cycle of bright moonlight caused the Japanese to rely on submarines to deliver provisions to their forces on Guadalcanal. Beginning on 16 November and continuing for the next three weeks, 16 submarines made nocturnal deliveries of foodstuffs to the island, with one submarine making the trip each night. Each submarine could deliver 20 to 30 tons of supplies, about one day&#x27;s worth of food for the 17th Army, but the difficult task of transporting the supplies by hand through the jungle to the frontline units limited their value to sustain the Japanese troops on Guadalcanal. At the same time, the Japanese tried to establish a chain of three bases in the central Solomons to allow small boats to use them as staging sites for making supply deliveries to Guadalcanal, but damaging Allied airstrikes on the bases forced the abandonment of this plan.

On 26 November the 17th Army notified Imamura that it faced a critical food crisis. Some front-line units had not been resupplied for six days, and even the rear-area troops were on one-third rations. The situation forced the Japanese to return to using destroyers to deliver the necessary supplies.

Eighth Fleet personnel devised a plan to help reduce the exposure of destroyers delivering supplies to Guadalcanal. Large oil or gas drums were cleaned and filled with medical supplies and food, with enough air space to provide buoyancy, and strung together with rope. When the destroyers arrived at Guadalcanal they would make a sharp turn, the drums would be cut loose, and a swimmer or boat from the shore could pick up the buoyed end of the rope and return it to the beach, where the soldiers could haul in the supplies.

The Eighth Fleet&#x27;s Guadalcanal Reinforcement Unit, based in the Shortland Islands and under the command of Rear Admiral Raizō Tanaka, was tasked by Mikawa with making the first of five scheduled runs using the drum method on the night of 30 November. Tanaka&#x27;s unit was centered on the eight ships of Destroyer Squadron (Desron) 2, with six destroyers assigned to carry from 200 to 240 drums of supplies apiece, to Tassafaronga Point. Tanaka&#x27;s flagship along with acted as escorts. The six drum-carrying destroyers were , , , , , and . To save weight, the drum-carrying destroyers left their reloads of Type 93 torpedoes (Long Lances) at the Shortlands, leaving each ship with eight torpedoes, one for each tube.

After the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, US Vice Admiral William Halsey, commander of Allied forces, South Pacific Area, had reorganized US naval forces under his command, including, on 24 November, the formation of Task Force 67 (TF67) at Espiritu Santo, comprising the heavy cruisers , , , and , the light cruiser , and four destroyers (, , , and ). US Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright replaced Thomas Kinkaid as commander of TF67 on 28 November.

Upon taking command, Wright briefed his ship commanders on his plan for engaging the Japanese in future; he expected night battles around Guadalcanal. The plan, which he had drafted with Kinkaid, stated that radar-equipped destroyers were to scout in front of the cruisers and deliver a surprise torpedo attack upon sighting Japanese warships, then vacate the area to give the cruisers a clear field of fire. The cruisers were then to engage with gunfire at a range of . The cruisers&#x27; floatplanes would scout and drop flares during the battle.

On 29 November Allied intelligence personnel intercepted and decoded a Japanese message transmitted to the 17th Army on Guadalcanal alerting them to Tanaka&#x27;s supply run. Informed of the message, Halsey ordered Wright to take TF67 to intercept Tanaka off Guadalcanal. TF67, with Wright flying his flag on &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, departed Espiritu Santo at just before midnight on 29 November for the run to Guadalcanal. En route, destroyers and , returning from a convoy escort assignment to Guadalcanal, were ordered to join up with TF67. Lacking the time to brief the commanding officers of the joining destroyers of his battle plan, Wright assigned them a position behind the cruisers. At 17:00 on 30 November, Wright&#x27;s cruisers launched one floatplane each for Tulagi to drop flares during the expected battle that night. At 20:00, Wright sent his crews to battle stations.

Tanaka&#x27;s force departed the Shortlands in the early morning of 30 November for the run to Guadalcanal. Tanaka attempted to evade Allied aerial reconnaissance aircraft by first heading northeast through Bougainville Strait before turning southeast and then south to pass through Indispensable Strait. Paul Mason, an Australian coastwatcher stationed in southern Bougainville, reported by radio the departure of Tanaka&#x27;s ships from Shortland, and this message was passed to Wright. At the same time, a Japanese search aircraft spotted an Allied convoy near Guadalcanal and communicated the sighting to Tanaka who told his destroyer commanders to expect action that night and that, &quot;In such an event, utmost efforts will be made to destroy the enemy without regard for the unloading of supplies.&quot;

==Battle==
===Order of battle===

===Prelude===

At 21:40 on 30 November, Tanaka&#x27;s ships sighted Savo Island from Indispensable Strait. The Japanese ships were in line ahead formation, interval , in the order of &quot;Takanami&quot;, &quot;Oyashio&quot;, &quot;Kuroshio&quot;, &quot;Kagerō&quot;, &quot;Makinami&quot;, &quot;Naganami&quot;, &quot;Kawakaze&quot;, and &quot;Suzukaze&quot;. At this same time, TF67 entered Lengo Channel en route to Ironbottom Sound. Wright&#x27;s ships were in column in the order &quot;Fletcher&quot;, &quot;Perkins&quot;, &quot;Maury&quot;, &quot;Drayton&quot;, &quot;Minneapolis&quot;, &quot;New Orleans&quot;, &quot;Pensacola&quot;, &quot;Honolulu&quot;, &quot;Northampton&quot;, &quot;Lamson&quot;, and &quot;Lardner&quot;. The four van destroyers led the cruisers by and the cruisers steamed apart.

At 22:40 Tanaka&#x27;s ships passed south of Savo about offshore from Guadalcanal and slowed to as they approached the unloading area. &quot;Takanami&quot; took station about seaward to screen the column. At the same time, TF67 exited Lengo Channel into the sound and headed at towards Savo Island. Wright&#x27;s van destroyers moved to a position slightly inshore of the cruisers. The night sky was moonless (the third-quarter moon would rise after midnight, after the fight was over) with between and of visibility. Because of extremely calm seas, which created a suction effect on their pontoons, Wright&#x27;s cruiser floatplanes were delayed in lifting off from Tulagi harbor and would not be a factor in the battle.

At 23:06, Wright&#x27;s force began to detect Tanaka&#x27;s ships on radar near Cape Esperance on Guadalcanal about away. Wright&#x27;s destroyers rejoined the column as it continued to head towards Savo. At the same time, Tanaka&#x27;s ships, which were not equipped with radar, split into two groups and prepared to shove the drums overboard. &quot;Naganami&quot;, &quot;Kawakaze&quot;, and &quot;Suzukaze&quot; headed for their drop-off point near Doma Reef while &quot;Makinami&quot;, &quot;Kagerō&quot;, &quot;Oyashio&quot;, and &quot;Kuroshio&quot; aimed for nearby Tassafaronga. At 23:12, &quot;Takanami&#x27;s&quot; crew visually sighted Wright&#x27;s column, quickly confirmed by lookouts on Tanaka&#x27;s other ships. At 23:16, Tanaka ordered unloading preparations halted and &quot;All ships attack.&quot;

===Action===

At 23:14, operators on &quot;Fletcher&quot; established firm radar contact with &quot;Takanami&quot; and the lead group of four drum-carrying destroyers. At 23:15, with the range , Commander William M. Cole, commander of Wright&#x27;s destroyer group and captain of &quot;Fletcher&quot;, radioed Wright for permission to fire torpedoes. Wright waited two minutes and then responded with, &quot;Range on bogies [Tanaka&#x27;s ships on radar] excessive at present.&quot; Cole responded that the range was fine. Another two minutes passed before Wright responded with permission to fire. In the meantime, the US destroyers&#x27; targets escaped from an optimum firing setup ahead to a marginal position passing abeam, giving the American torpedoes a long overtaking run near the limit of their range. At 23:20, &quot;Fletcher&quot;, &quot;Perkins&quot;, and &quot;Drayton&quot; fired 20 Mark 15 torpedoes towards Tanaka&#x27;s ships. &quot;Maury&quot;, lacking SG radar and thus having no contacts, withheld fire.

At the same time, Wright ordered his force to open fire. At 23:21, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; complied with her first salvo, quickly followed by the other American cruisers. Cole&#x27;s four destroyers fired star shells to illuminate the targets as previously directed then increased speed to clear the area for the cruisers to operate.

Because of her closer proximity to Wright&#x27;s column, &quot;Takanami&quot; was the target of most of the Americans&#x27; initial gunfire. &quot;Takanami&quot; returned fire and launched her full load of eight torpedoes but was quickly hit by American gunfire and, within four minutes, was set afire and incapacitated. As &quot;Takanami&quot; was destroyed, the rest of Tanaka&#x27;s ships, almost unnoticed by the Americans, were increasing speed, maneuvering, and preparing to respond to the American attack. All of the American torpedoes missed. Historian Russell S. Crenshaw Jr. postulates that had the 24 Mark 15 torpedoes fired by US Navy destroyers during the battle not been fatally flawed, the outcome of the battle might have been different.

Tanaka&#x27;s flagship &quot;Naganami&quot; reversed course to starboard, opened fire and began laying a smoke screen. The next two ships astern, &quot;Kawakaze&quot; and &quot;Suzukaze&quot;, reversed course to port. At 23:23, &quot;Suzukaze&quot; fired eight torpedoes in the direction of the gunflashes from Wright&#x27;s cruisers, followed by &quot;Naganami&quot; and &quot;Kawakaze&quot; which fired their full loads of eight torpedoes at 23:32 and 23:33 respectively.

Meanwhile, the four destroyers at the head of the Japanese column maintained their heading down the Guadalcanal coast, allowing Wright&#x27;s cruisers to pass on the opposite course. Once clear of &quot;Takanami&quot; at 23:28, &quot;Kuroshio&quot; fired four and &quot;Oyashio&quot; fired eight torpedoes in the direction of Wright&#x27;s column and then reversed course and increased speed. Wright&#x27;s cruisers maintained the same course and speed as the 44 Japanese torpedoes headed in their direction.

At 23:27, as &quot;Minneapolis&quot; fired her ninth salvo and Wright prepared to order a course change for his column, two torpedoes, from either &quot;Suzukaze&quot; or &quot;Takanami&quot;, struck her forward half. One warhead exploded the aviation fuel storage tanks forward of turret one and the other knocked out three of the ship&#x27;s four firerooms. The bow forward of turret one folded down at a 70-degree angle, and the ship lost power and steering control. Thirty-seven men were killed.
Less than a minute later a torpedo hit &quot;New Orleans&quot; abreast of turret one and exploded the ship&#x27;s forward ammunition magazines and aviation gasoline storage. The blast severed the ship&#x27;s entire bow forward of turret two. The bow twisted to port, damaging the ship&#x27;s hull as it was wrenched free by the ship&#x27;s momentum, and sank immediately off the aft port quarter. Everyone in turrets one and two perished. &quot;New Orleans&quot; was forced into a reverse course to starboard and lost steering and communications. A total of 183 men were killed. Herbert Brown, a seaman in the ship&#x27;s plotting room, described the scene after the torpedo hit: 

&quot;Pensacola&quot; followed next astern in the cruiser column. Observing &quot;Minneapolis&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot; taking hits and slowing, &quot;Pensacola&quot; steered to pass them on the port side and then, once past, returned to the same base course. At 23:39, &quot;Pensacola&quot; took a torpedo, fired from &quot;Oyashio&quot;, abreast the mainmast. The explosion spread flaming oil throughout the interior and across the main deck of the ship, killing 125 of the ship&#x27;s crew. The hit ripped away the port outer driveshaft, and the ship took a 13-degree list and lost power, communications, and steering.

Astern of &quot;Pensacola&quot;, &quot;Honolulu&#x27;s&quot; captain chose to pass &quot;Minneapolis&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot; on the starboard side. At the same time, the ship increased speed to , maneuvered radically, and successfully transited the battle area without taking any damage while maintaining main battery fire at the rapidly disappearing Japanese destroyers.

The last cruiser in the American column, &quot;Northampton&quot;, followed &quot;Honolulu&quot; to pass the damaged cruisers ahead to starboard. Unlike &quot;Honolulu&quot;, &quot;Northampton&quot; did not increase speed or attempt any radical maneuvers. At 23:48, after returning to the base course, &quot;Northampton&quot; was hit by two of &quot;Kawakaze&#x27;s&quot; torpedoes. One hit below the waterline abreast the after engine room, and the second hit further aft. The after engine room flooded, three of four shafts ceased turning, and the ship listed 10 degrees to port and caught fire. Fifty men were killed.

The last ships in Wright&#x27;s column, &quot;Lamson&quot; and &quot;Lardner&quot;, failed to locate any targets and exited the battle area to the east after being mistakenly fired on by machine guns from &quot;New Orleans&quot;. Cole&#x27;s four destroyers circled completely around Savo Island at maximum speed and reentered the battle area, but the engagement had already ended.

Meanwhile, at 23:44 Tanaka ordered his ships to break contact and retire from the battle area. As they proceeded up Guadalcanal&#x27;s coast, &quot;Kuroshio&quot; and &quot;Kagerō&quot; fired eight more torpedoes towards the American ships, which all missed. When &quot;Takanami&quot; failed to respond to radio calls, Tanaka directed &quot;Oyashio&quot; and &quot;Kuroshio&quot; to go to her assistance. The two destroyers located the burning ship at 01:00 on 1 December but abandoned rescue efforts after detecting American warships in the area. &quot;Oyashio&quot; and &quot;Kuroshio&quot; quickly departed the sound to rejoin the rest of Tanaka&#x27;s ships for the return journey to the Shortlands, which they reached 10 hours later. &quot;Takanami&quot; was the only Japanese warship hit by American gunfire and seriously damaged during the battle.

==Aftermath==
&quot;Takanami&quot;&#x27;s surviving crew abandoned ship at 01:30, but a large explosion killed many more of them in the water, including the destroyer division commander, Toshio Shimizu, and the ship&#x27;s captain, Masami Ogura. Of her crew of 244, 48 survived to reach shore on Guadalcanal, and 19 of them were captured by the Americans.

&quot;Northampton&quot;&#x27;s crew was unable to contain the ship&#x27;s fires and list and began to abandon ship at 01:30. The ship sank at 03:04 about from Doma Cove on Guadalcanal (). &quot;Fletcher&quot; and &quot;Drayton&quot; rescued the ship&#x27;s 773 survivors.

&quot;Minneapolis&quot;, &quot;New Orleans&quot;, and &quot;Pensacola&quot; were able to sail the to Tulagi by the morning of 1 December, where they were berthed for emergency repairs. The fires on &quot;Pensacola&quot; burned for 12 hours before being extinguished. &quot;Pensacola&quot; departed Tulagi for rear area ports and further repair on 6 December. After construction of temporary bows from coconut logs, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; and &quot;New Orleans&quot; departed Tulagi for Espiritu Santo or Sydney, Australia on 12 December. All three cruisers required lengthy and extensive repairs. &quot;New Orleans&quot; returned to action in August, &quot;Minneapolis&quot; in September, and &quot;Pensacola&quot; in October 1943.

The battle was one of the worst defeats suffered by the US Navy in World War II, third only to the Attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Savo Island. In spite of his defeat in the battle, Wright was awarded the Navy Cross, one of the highest American military decorations for bravery, for his actions during the engagement. Mitigating to some degree the destruction of his task force, Wright, in his after-action report, claimed that his force sank four Japanese destroyers and damaged two others. Halsey, in his comments on Wright&#x27;s report, placed much of the blame for the defeat on Cole, saying that the destroyer squadron commander fired his torpedoes from too great a distance to be effective and should have &quot;helped&quot; the cruisers instead of circling around Savo Island. Tanaka claimed to have sunk a battleship and two cruisers in the battle. Historian Samuel Eliot Morison assessed the outcome by saying: &quot;It is a painful truth that the Battle of Tassafaronga was a sharp defeat inflicted on an alert and superior cruiser force by a partially surprised and inferior destroyer force.&quot;

After the war, Tanaka said of his victory at Tassafaronga, &quot;I have heard that US naval experts praised my command in that action. I am not deserving of such honors. It was the superb proficiency and devotion of the men who served me that produced the tactical victory for us.&quot; As for the US Navy, he said: &quot;The enemy had discovered our plans and movements, had put planes in the air beforehand for purposes of illumination, had got into formation for an artillery engagement, and cleverly gained the advantage of prior neutralization fire. But his fire was inaccurate, shells improperly set for deflection were especially numerous, and it is conjectured that either his marksmanship is not remarkable or else the illumination from his star shells was not sufficiently effective.”
Cole&#x27;s experience at Tassafaronga led to Arleigh Burke&#x27;s standing orders to his own ships that &quot;destroyers are to attack the enemy on first contact without awaiting orders from task force commander,&quot; which were instrumental in his success in the battles of Empress Augusta Bay and Cape St. George. Cole also influenced Commander Frederick Moosbrugger&#x27;s tactics at the Battle of Vella Gulf, in which Moosbrugger withheld gunfire until his own torpedoes were observed hitting enemy ships, surprising the Japanese.

The results of the battle led to further discussion in the US Pacific Fleet about changes in tactical doctrine and the need for technical improvements, such as flashless powder. It was not until eight months later that the naval high command recognized there were serious problems with the functioning of the torpedoes. The Americans were still unaware of the range and power of Japanese torpedoes and the effectiveness of Japanese night battle tactics. In fact, Wright claimed that his ships must have been fired on by submarines since the observed position of Tanaka&#x27;s ships &quot;make it improbable that torpedoes with speed–distance characteristics similar to our own&quot; could have caused such damage. The Americans would not recognize the true capabilities of their Pacific adversary&#x27;s torpedoes and night tactics until well into 1943.
In spite of their defeat in the battle, the Americans had prevented Tanaka from landing the desperately needed food supplies on Guadalcanal, albeit at high cost. A second Japanese supply delivery attempt by ten destroyers led by Tanaka on 3 December successfully dumped 1,500 drums of provisions off Tassafaronga Point, but strafing American aircraft sank all but 310 of them the next day before they could be pulled ashore. On 7 December, a third attempt by 12 destroyers was turned back by US PT boats off Cape Esperance. The next night, two US PT boats torpedoed and sank the Japanese submarine as it attempted to deliver supplies to Guadalcanal. Based on the difficulties experienced trying to deliver food to the island, the Japanese Navy informed Imamura on 8 December that they intended to stop all destroyer transportation runs to Guadalcanal immediately. After Imamura protested, the navy agreed to one more run to the island.

The last attempt to deliver food to Guadalcanal by destroyers in 1942 was led by Tanaka on the night of 11 December and consisted of 11 destroyers. Five US PT boats met Tanaka off Guadalcanal and torpedoed his flagship , severely damaging the destroyer and injuring Tanaka. After Tanaka transferred to &quot;Naganami&quot;, &quot;Teruzuki&quot; was scuttled. Only 220 of the 1,200 drums released that night were recovered by Japanese army personnel on shore. Tanaka was subsequently relieved of command and transferred to Japan on 29 December.

On 12 December the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies, on 31 December Japan&#x27;s Imperial General Headquarters, with approval from Emperor Hirohito, agreed to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and the establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomon Islands on New Georgia. The Japanese evacuated their remaining forces from Guadalcanal over three nights 2–7 February 1943, conceding the hard-fought campaign to the Allies. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan&#x27;s defeat and the end of World War II.

The three Rogers brothers, who all served on &quot;New Orleans&quot;, died during the Battle of Tassafaronga. Their deaths were similar to the loss of the five Sullivan brothers on only two weeks earlier. These groups of siblings&#x27; deaths led to the Sole Survivor Policy and the military policy that bans family members from serving together in combat areas.

<text>The National anthem of Mauritania (), also known by its incipit, &quot;&quot; (; ), was officially adopted on 28 November 2017 and was composed by Egyptian composer Rageh Daoud.

==History==
In March 2017, following a referendum to amend the Constitution of July 1991, the Mauritanian National Assembly adopted a new national anthem to replace the previous one, which was considered almost impossible to sing.

== Lyrics ==
The anthem currently has six verses, with a chorus repeated after each verse. The fifth verse (in brackets) is sung in an extended version of the anthem. It was first sung on the 57th Independence Day of Mauritania, on 28 November 2017.

=== Full lyrics ===
=== Short version ===
On official occasions requiring brevity, a short version is sung, comprising verse one (which is repeated), the chorus (which is split before line three), verse two and verse six.

<doc id="543695" wikidata="Q4352720" url="?curid=543695" title="USS Perkins (DD-877)">
<text>USS &quot;Perkins&quot; (DD/DDR-877) was a in the United States Navy. She was the third Navy ship named for Commodore George H. Perkins USN (1835–1899).

&quot;Perkins&quot; was laid down by the Consolidated Steel Corporation at Orange, Texas on 19 June 1944, launched on 7 December 1944 by Mrs. Larz Anderson (Isabel Weld Perkins) and commissioned on 4 April 1945.

==Service history==

===1945–1949===
Following shakedown off Cuba, &quot;Perkins&quot; entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for conversion to a radar picket destroyer. In July 1945 she underwent refresher training, rendezvoused with the aircraft carrier on 20 July, and headed for the Pacific. At Pearl Harbor she joined Destroyer Division 52 (DesDiv 52) and on 19 August sailed for the Far East. She entered Tokyo Bay the day of the formal Japanese surrender, on 2 September, and on the 3rd joined Task Force 38 (TF 38). Operations in the Marshalls, Marianas, and off Japan followed and in April 1946 she returned to Pearl Harbor. On the 28th she arrived at San Diego, California whence she operated for the next year.

In May 1947, she returned to the Far East for three months on the China station, two weeks of which were spent off Qinhuangdao, on the Bohai Sea, observing Communist Chinese forces.

&quot;Perkins&quot; returned to California in October and in January 1948 sailed to the Marshalls for the atomic bomb test series &quot;Operation Sandstone&quot;. Overhaul followed her return to San Diego in June and on 4 January 1949 she departed the west coast for another tour off the China coast. Arriving at Qingdao on 7 February, she was redesignated DDR–877 on 18 February. Scheduled exercises soon began, but, in addition, she was called on to lift foreign residents of Tsingtao to Hong Kong as Communist forces took over the former city in May. In June she battled her first typhoon, and after visiting Singapore in August, she returned to San Diego.

===1950–1959===
Engaged in training exercises off the west coast and yard overhaul for the next year, &quot;Perkins&quot;, reassigned to DesDiv 11, sailed west again in mid-August 1950. She served on SAR station in the central Pacific, returned to the west coast in October, and on 2 February 1951 got underway for the embattled coast of Korea. Between March and September she performed screening and plane guard duties for the carriers of TF 77 and carried out gunfire support and shore bombardment missions with TF 95. On 25 September &quot;Perkins&quot; arrived at Yokosuka, Japan from the bombline and the next day continued on toward the United States. In June 1952 she returned to Korea. She spent July entirely on the bombline, shifted briefly to TF 77, then steamed south for duty on the Taiwan Patrol. By 8 September she was back on the bombline. On 15 October, while covering minesweeping operations preparatory to an amphibious feint against Kojo, north of the battlefront, one of her crew was killed and 17 were wounded by two near misses from Communist shore batteries. Only slightly damaged, she continued her combat activities and for the remainder of her tour alternated gunfire support operations with carrier escort duties.

At the end of the year &quot;Perkins&quot; returned to the United States. In July 1953 she completed a six-month overhaul and in August she returned to the Far East. There six months she patrolled off the Korean coast and Taiwan Strait and participated in exercises from Japan to the Philippines. After that deployment &quot;Perkins&quot; continued to rotate between duty with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific and operations with the 1st Fleet off the west coast. In July 1956 she contributed to the information gathering effort of the International Geophysical Year (IGY) by &quot;chasing&quot; weather balloons and in September 1959 helped TF 77 forestall overt hostilities during the Laotian crisis.

=== 1960–1973===
In March 1962 she entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM). Redesignated DD-877, on 30 September, she emerged from the Mark II overhaul and conversion in December with a new superstructure configured for QH-50 DASH. The &quot;new&quot; destroyer spent the next ten months exercising off the west coast and in mid-October 1963 resumed annual deployments to WestPac, her first mission to conduct operations with the carrier in the South China Sea. Continuing to alternate 7th Fleet and 1st Fleet duty tours into 1970, each of &quot;Perkins&quot;″s WestPac deployments returned her to the South China Sea where, off the coast of Vietnam, she served as plane guard for carriers on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; in the Tonkin Gulf, participated in &quot;Sea Dragon&quot; and &quot;Market Time&quot; operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out naval gunfire support missions during the conflict.

=== Argentine service===

&quot;Perkins&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 January 1973, transferred to Argentina. She was renamed ARA &quot;Comodoro Py&quot; (D-27), and served in the Argentine Navy. She was stricken in 1984.

On 15 June 1987, &quot;Comodoro Py&quot; was sunk as a target off Mar del Plata by a torpedo fired from the Argentine Navy .

<text>An exedra (: exedras or exedrae) is a semicircular architectural recess or platform, sometimes crowned by a semi-dome, and either set into a building&#x27;s façade or free-standing. The original Greek word &quot;ἐξέδρα&quot; (&#x27;a seat out of doors&#x27;) was applied to a room that opened onto a stoa, ringed with curved high-backed stone benches, a suitable place for conversation. An exedra may also be expressed by a curved break in a colonnade, perhaps with a semicircular seat.

The exedra would typically have an apsidal podium that supported the stone bench. The free-standing (open air) exedra, often supporting bronze portrait sculpture, is a familiar Hellenistic structure, characteristically sited along sacred ways or in open places in sanctuaries, such as at Delos or Epidaurus. Some Hellenistic exedras were built in relation to a city&#x27;s agora, as in Priene. Monument architects have also used this free-standing style in modern times.

==Rise==
The exedra achieved particular popularity in ancient Roman architecture during the Roman Empire. In the 1st century AD, Nero&#x27;s architects incorporated exedrae throughout the planning of his Domus Aurea, enriching the volumes of the party rooms, a part of what made Nero&#x27;s palace so breathtakingly pretentious to traditional Romans, for no one had ever seen domes and exedrae in a dwelling before.

An exedra was normally a public feature: when rhetoricians and philosophers disputed in a Roman gymnasium it was in an exedra opening into the peristyle that they gathered. A basilica featured a large exedra at the far end from its entrance, where the magistrates sat, usually raised up several steps, in hearing cases. This was called a &quot;tribuna&quot; in Latin, and tribune is used for an area of raised floor backing onto a wall, often in an exedra.

==Later uses==
Following precedents from Rome, exedrae continued to be in widespread use architecturally after the fall of Rome. In Byzantine architecture and Romanesque architecture, this familiar feature developed into the apse and is fully treated there.

The term &quot;exedra&quot; is still often used for secondary apses or niches in the more complicated plans of later Byzantine churches; another term is conch, named for the scallop shell form often taken by the half-dome cap. A famous use of the exedra is in Donato Bramante&#x27;s Cortile del Belvedere extension of the Vatican Palace; that exedra was initially open to the sky.

In Muslim architecture, the exedra becomes a &quot;mihrab&quot; and invariably retains religious associations, wherever it is seen, even on the smallest scale, as a prayer niche.

Both Baroque and Neoclassical architecture used exedrae. Baroque architects, (for example, Pietro da Cortona in his Villa Pigneto), used them to enrich the play of light and shade and give rein to expressive volumes; Neoclassical architects, to articulate the rhythmic pacing of a wall elevation.

The interior exedra was richly exploited by Scottish neoclassical architect Robert Adam and his followers.

==Public landscapes==

A classic example of a Baroque exedra on a (comparatively) reduced scale within its context, is the central niche of the Trevi Fountain in Rome, sheltering a statue of Neptune.

Many classicizing bandshells in public parks are exedra, for the shape, with its half-dome heading, reflects sound forwards. The Hollywood Bowl&#x27;s shell (&quot;illus. at that entry&quot;) takes the form of the head of a gargantuan exedra, stripped of classicizing details.
The Spreckels Temple of Music in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco is another example of such a free-standing classicized bandshells

Public monuments without any covering use a freestanding semicircular exedra with a bench, often to give a platform to a statue, for example at &quot;Abraham Lincoln: The Head of State&quot; monument in Grant Park (Chicago), the Houdini grave in New York, and the &quot;Signing of the Mayflower Compact&quot; Bas Relief in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

The Great Court on the urban campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (now UIC), had four modern examples of the exedra. The elevated Great Court, which served as the campus quad, had one exedra in each quadrant: two with four sections of seating facing in, one with two sections of seating facing in, and one inside-out exedra with two sections of seating facing out. In the center of the Great Court was the Circle Forum, which extended down to ground level. Designed by Walter Netsch of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the lack of maintenance led to disrepair and, ultimately, to being demolished.

==Gardens==

During the 18th century, an exedra became a popular garden feature or folly, often used as an ornamental curved screening wall to hide another part of the garden. Examples can be found at Belton House and West Wycombe Park.
An exedra can be used in landscape design to visually terminate a garden axis. They can incorporate seating, a fountain, tile-work, and landscape lighting; in traditional or contemporary styles.

In New York City&#x27;s Central Park, overlooking Conservatory Water, is the Waldo Hutchins bench, a curved Concord white granite exedra outdoor bench. The bench is almost tall by long, and weighs several tons. Its architect was Eric Gugler, and in 1932 it was executed by the Piccirilli Brothers studio, the firm that carved the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="543698" wikidata="Q456989" url="?curid=543698" title="Willem Verhulst">
<text>Willem Verhulst or Willem van Hulst was an employee of the Dutch West India Company and the second (provisional) Director of the New Netherland colony in 1625–26. Nothing can be verified about his life before and after this period. Verhulst may have consummated the purchase of Manhattan Island on behalf of the Dutch West India Company, although there is still considerable debate over the evidence that also supports the purchase by Peter Minuit.

==Life and career==
Verhulst sailed from the Netherlands in January 1625 on the ship &quot;Orangenboom&quot; (&quot;Orange Tree&quot;) as &quot;provisionally director of the colonists&quot;. In April of that year, four more ships sailed out with settlers and farm animals (the ships were named &quot;Paert, Koe, Schaep&quot;, and &quot;Makreel&quot;, meaning &quot;horse, &quot;cow&quot;, sheep&quot; and &quot;mackerel&quot;). He had received detailed instructions from the board of directors. In 1625, Verhulst oversaw the decision to locate Fort Amsterdam, the company&#x27;s main fortress, and town on the tip of Manhattan Island in the colony of New Netherland. The settlement, which was given the name New Amsterdam, was the first permanent European settlement in what was later called New York City.

Verhulst was not popular with the Dutch colonists and was quickly replaced by Peter Minuit. He sailed back to the Dutch Republic on the &quot;Wapen van Amsterdam&quot; (&quot;Arms of Amsterdam&quot;) which left September 23 and arrived November 4, 1626 in Amsterdam. He brought with him the news that the colony was doing well and that Manhattan had been bought from the natives for goods valued at 60 guilders, leading some historians to propose that the otherwise obscure Verhulst oversaw this transaction. Although, there is still significant debate over the evidence, whether Minuit or Verhulst had executed the permission of the island of Manhattan.and the traditional version of the story attributes Peter Minuit with conducting and completing the purchase.

<text>Peter Hugh Pocklington (born November 18, 1941) is a Canadian entrepreneur.

Peter Pocklington was known among North American hockey fans as &quot;Peter Puck&quot;, an entrepreneur from oil-rich Alberta who was also the owner of the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers. He earned the enmity of many Canadians when he sold hockey&#x27;s greatest player, Wayne Gretzky, to the Los Angeles Kings.

A vocal advocate of free-market capitalism, Pocklington had various business interests throughout his career. Outside sports, his best-known venture was his tenure as owner of a meatpacking plant in Edmonton, where he became embroiled in a bitter labour dispute in 1986.

Pocklington&#x27;s life experiences were extensively documented in the 2009 biography, &quot;I&#x27;d Trade Him Again: On Gretzky, Politics and the Pursuit of the Perfect Deal&quot;, written by Terry McConnell and J&#x27;lyn Nye. The book&#x27;s title was inspired by Pocklington&#x27;s ongoing conviction the Gretzky trade was the right deal at the right time and had a positive impact on all parties concerned: the Oilers, the Kings, Gretzky, and the game itself.

==Early life and career==
Pocklington was born in Regina, Saskatchewan, to Basil Cohen Pocklington, an insurance executive who had immigrated from England as a young man, and his wife, Eileen (Dempsey), and grew up in London, Ontario.

The greatest influence on young Pocklington was the legendary motivational speaker Earl Nightingale and his best-selling recording, &quot;The Strangest Secret&quot;. &quot;It literally stated, &#x27;You become what you think about,&#x27; &quot; Pocklington told his biographers. He says he still has the record today.

One of his earliest business ventures was to find old cars on the farms around his maternal grandparents&#x27; home in Carberry, Manitoba, buy them for $25, then ship them to Ontario by train, where he sold them for upwards of $500. Because of the West&#x27;s dry, cold climate, the cars, many of them 25 to 40 years old, were in better shape than comparable vehicles that had been driven on Ontario&#x27;s salted roads.

By the time Pocklington was 25, he owned his first car dealership, Westown Ford in Tilbury, Ontario. At the time, he was the youngest Ford dealer in Canada. Within a few years, he had sold the Tilbury dealership and bought another nearby Chatham. By 1971, when Pocklington was only 29, he left Ontario and moved west, where he bought Shirley Ford in Edmonton, Alberta. Within a few years, Pocklington was running the most successful Ford dealership in Canada. He also had the cash flow to buy Edmonton&#x27;s fledgling team in the World Hockey Association (WHA), the Edmonton Oilers.

===Sports owner===
Pocklington would come to operate several businesses over the next several years, but he has always said owning sports teams gave him the most satisfaction.

The man who came to be known as &quot;Peter Puck&quot; bought part ownership of the Edmonton Oilers in 1976. According to his biography, he offered a diamond ring his wife was wearing to dinner as his downpayment. Within a year, Pocklington bought out his partner, Nelson Skalbania, who would later own the WHA&#x27;s Indianapolis Racers. It was also from Skalbania that Pocklington acquired perhaps the greatest hockey player ever. In the fall of 1978, Skalbania offered Pocklington the rights to a 17-year-old phenom Wayne Gretzky. The Oilers&#x27; owner did not hesitate to do the deal. A few months later, Pocklington parlayed the Gretzky signing into a merger between the WHA and the National Hockey League (NHL); with this, the Oilers became members of the NHL. Five years later, the Oilers would win their first of five Stanley Cup championships they would capture under Pocklington&#x27;s ownership.

Over the next 18 years, Pocklington also owned the Edmonton Trappers of baseball&#x27;s Pacific Coast League, the Edmonton Drillers of the North American Soccer League and the National Professional Soccer League, the Edmonton Brick Men of the Canadian Soccer League, and the Kamloops Junior Oilers of the Western Hockey League.

===Entrepreneur===
Edmonton in the 1970s was experiencing explosive growth fuelled by an oil boom and several fortunes were made, not only by Pocklington but by the likes of Pat Bowlen, later owner of the National Football League&#x27;s Denver Broncos. Pocklington’s business empire eventually exceeded $2 billion in sales; massive real estate holdings throughout Alberta and Ontario; Fidelity Trust, one of Canada&#x27;s largest trust companies; Palm Dairies, one of the largest retailers of dairy products in Western Canada; Canbra Foods, a canola manufacturer; Magic Pantry, which sold prepared foods that did not require refrigeration; Kretschmar Foods, which serviced restaurants; Green Acre Farms, a chicken-processing company with plants in Texas and Mississippi; and Gainers, an Edmonton-based beef- and pork-packing company.

===Hostage-taking===
Pocklington was also taken hostage by a gunman who broke into his home. &quot;I thought I was bullet-proof—until I was shot,&quot; Pocklington told his biographers. The kidnapper was caught and Pocklington made a full recovery. The plan of the kidnapper, Mirko Petrović, was to kidnap Eva Pocklington, but she escaped. The other two people in the house were released, leaving Pocklington, who was with the gunman for 11 hours while he negotiated a $2 million ransom. However, before the ransom could be paid, police snuck into the house and shot both Petrović and Pocklington, wounding both men. They each made a full recovery and Petrović served five years in an Alberta prison before he was released and returned to Yugoslavia.

===Politics===
In 1983, Pocklington entered the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leadership convention. He campaigned on a platform of free trade with the United States, privatizing government-owned Crown corporations like Air Canada, Petro-Canada and Canadian National Railway, retiring the national debt and implementing a flat tax. In the end, Pocklington fell far below his expectations of delegates; one advisor jokingly guessed &quot;99&quot;, Gretzky&#x27;s sweater number, and Pocklington came close to receiving 102 delegates. He withdrew his candidacy before the second ballot and supported the eventual winner Brian Mulroney, who would adopt some of Pocklington&#x27;s policies while in government.

==Philanthropy==
Pocklington was an active philanthropist for many years in Edmonton. Among his gifts were $1.5 million he helped raise for the Canadian Cystic Fibrosis Foundation; $1 million for the Jamie Platz YMCA; $300,000 for the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta; $250,000 to establish a free-enterprise chair at the University of Alberta&#x27;s School of Business; and upwards of $2 million for Junior Achievement. It was through his charitable works that he became close friends with famed tenor Luciano Pavarotti, former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, and former U.S. presidents Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. From 1995 to 2010, Pocklington served as a member of the board of directors for the Betty Ford Center.

==Leaving Canada for the United States==
In 1998, after selling the Oilers, Pocklington moved to the U.S. with his wife Eva, and settled in Palm Desert, California. He remains active in business and philanthropic pursuits there, and was for a long time member of the board of directors at the Betty Ford Center. While Pocklington remains a controversial figure in Canada because of the Gretzky trade, he has his fans, too. On October 8, 2014, Pocklington was invited back to Edmonton when the Oilers organized a 30-year reunion of their first Stanley Cup championship team. When he was introduced, he received a standing ovation from the 17,000 fans in attendance.

==Controversies==
===Gainers strike===
While Pocklington&#x27;s business empire realized its successes, it suffered its failures, too. Prime interest rates in the early 1980s topped out at 18.5%, a development that sapped the oil boom of its strength, collapsed the real estate market, and sank Fidelity Trust in a sea of declining property values.

Pocklington&#x27;s labour dispute with the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union ended up crippling Gainers, which at the time was Canada&#x27;s second-largest meat packer. During the union&#x27;s six-month strike, Pocklington used strikebreakers, primarily from Quebec, to keep the plant operating despite the picket lines, a decision that earned him the enmity of Canada&#x27;s labour movement. Eventually, he agreed to settle the strike and rehire the striking workers at the request of the Alberta government. In return, says Pocklington in his biography, then-Premier of Alberta Don Getty agreed to give Gainers an interest-free loan of $50 million. Gainers would give the province 10% of its operating profit every year for the next four years, and repay a conventional mortgage after that. Pocklington also insisted the province disband its pork marketing board, which fixed prices on pork at a rate higher than what the meat packers could sell it in the marketplace. Instead, the government gave Gainers $55 million at 10.5% interest, refusing to disband the marketing board. &quot;They said, &#x27;Take it or leave it,&#x27;&quot; Pocklington told his biographers. Crippled with a debt-servicing cost it did not anticipate and handicapped by inflated production costs created by the marketing board, Gainers immediately began to drown in debt. Loan repayments were missed and within three years, the Alberta government took over Gainers. The province lost $89 million on the venture in the four years it operated Gainers—more than double the rate of loss in Pocklington&#x27;s last few years at the helm—and eventually sold the company for 1/20 of the price Pocklington paid for it 11 years earlier.

===Stanley Cup===

After the Edmonton Oilers won their first Stanley Cup in 1983–84, Peter Pocklington included his father, Basil Pocklington, on the list of people and players who were to have their names engraved on the trophy. The NHL did not check the validity of the names on the list, and the Cup was engraved as usual. NHL executives, via the Hockey Hall of Fame, had the engraver strike out the name of the senior Pocklington by engraving a series of &quot;X&quot;s over his name. When Peter Pocklington was confronted with the issue, he protested it was the engraver&#x27;s fault, not his, that the engraver had mixed up the people who were technical members of the team (Basil was not one of them) with a list of individuals who were to receive miniature replica Cups (Basil &quot;was&quot; one of them).

After this error, the NHL and Hockey Hall of Fame adopted policies to confirm the roster and the relation of the people on the engraving list to the championship team. Of the two dozen engraving errors that appear on the Stanley Cup all but one are spelling errors. Basil Pocklington was the only name that was covered until November 2021, when the Hall of Fame struck the name of 2009–10 Chicago Blackhawks video coach Brad Aldrich due to sexual assault charges during that season.

===Gretzky trade===

On August 9, 1988, Pocklington shocked hockey fans by trading Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gélinas, $15 million cash, and the Kings&#x27; first-round draft picks in 1989, 1991 and 1993. One member of the House of Commons of Canada demanded the government block the trade, another man burned Pocklington in effigy, and Gretzky&#x27;s bride, actress Janet Jones, was branded hockey&#x27;s &quot;Yoko Ono&quot;.

There is debate as to whether Gretzky &quot;jumped&quot; or was &quot;pushed&quot;. A book by former Kings owner Bruce McNall quotes Pocklington as saying Gretzky had become impossible to deal with since he began dating Jones, who let it be known that she was not going to live in Edmonton after they got married. Pocklington claims he has had only nice things to say about the couple, yet he has repeatedly defended the trade as being a sound business decision that he would not hesitate to make again. However, he would later admit the trade to be a difficult and regrettable decision, but a vital transaction to keep the team financially afloat.

===Losing the Oilers===
By the late 1980s, increasing player salaries led the Oilers to trade Gretzky and other stars, such as Paul Coffey, Mark Messier, Jari Kurri, Glenn Anderson, Kevin Lowe and Grant Fuhr. By the mid-1990s, the Oilers were still losing money, but Pocklington balked at using his other businesses to bankroll his hockey team. He publicly threatened to move the team to Hamilton and Minneapolis, but never made good on the threats. He would almost sell the team to then Houston Rockets owner Les Alexander, and the team almost moved to Houston until a locally-based investors group bought the team shortly before the conclusion of the 1997-98 season in May 1998, which elected to keep them in Edmonton.

Pocklington operated the team on a line of credit, paying 19% interest to the Alberta Treasury Branches (ATB). He asked the ATB to convert the outstanding amount, about $120 million into a conventional mortgage he could pay down. The ATB refused and instead called his loan. His remaining business empire was sold off piece by piece, including the Oilers and Trappers, and Cambra Foods. Years later, Pocklington told his biographers, &quot;Losing the Oilers was like having my heart torn out.&quot;

===Stanley Cup rings===
In May 2012, Pocklington announced his family was auctioning memorabilia from his time as owner of the Oilers, including his rings from their Stanley Cup championships. According to the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, this was the second time the rings were put up for auction. In 2008, an anonymous bidder offered $272,829 for the rings but withdrew his bid amid rumours the rings were not the only set Pocklington had commissioned. Pocklington later claimed in his biography the confusion stemmed from a set of rings he had made for his father, and were sold by his father’s estate in 2001. The rings offered in 2008 and again in 2012 have been certified as authentic, he said.

===Business setbacks===
Pocklington invested in several businesses in the U.S., including the nutraceutical maker Naturade, and golf club manufacturers Golf Gear and Sonartec. However, those investments yielded more heartache than profit, and what he claims was fiduciary malfeasance by some partners in these ventures left Pocklington the target of numerous lawsuits. In the summer of 2008, one of those suits resulted in raids by U.S. Marshals of the Pocklington home in Indian Wells, California, where a number of items belonging to his wife, including gowns, shoes and purses, as well as Andy Warhol prints of Mick Jagger, were seized. These were eventually returned.

===Avoiding prison time===
While a lower court had retroactively revoked Peter Pocklington&#x27;s probation on a perjury conviction and sentenced him to six months in prison, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling on appeal. &quot;The Probation Office was crystal clear about the absence of anything resembling probable cause,&quot; wrote Judge Margaret McKeown. The court had earlier heard evidence that Pocklington had, over 19 months, failed to disclose consulting fees paid to a company controlled by his wife. Pocklington argued that was not the case, that all income was reported through tax returns and bank statements. Nevertheless, California District Court Judge Virginia A. Phillips gave Pocklington until December 9, 2013, to report to prison.

At the time, Pocklington released a statement saying, &quot;I accept full responsibility for my actions.&quot;

On December 6, 2013, the CBC reported Pocklington would appeal his sentence, had been released on $100,000 bail, and would not be reporting to prison as ordered.

On July 3, 2015, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; reported that the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had reversed the ruling. In vacating Judge Phillips&#x27; original order, &quot;The district court lacked jurisdiction to extend Pocklington’s probation beyond its October 26, 2012, expiration date,&quot; the appeal court panel said in a written judgment.

===Conjecture===
In April 2012, investigators with the Arizona Corporation Commission alleged Pocklington and an associate, John McNeil, had engaged in securities fraud related to Crystal Pistol Resources LLC and Liberty Bell Resources 1, LLC. Pocklington vigorously denied the allegations, insisted he and McNeil had done nothing wrong, and that investors in the mining venture were not being misled. The geologists associated with the project were, according to the mining company newsletter, also vigorously defending their data. Those geologists &quot;boast impeccable reputations and have been conscientious and thorough in their testing&quot;, Pocklington wrote in a letter to the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;. &quot;We do not tell our investors anything their data is not telling us.&quot;

On June 4, 2013, a decision rendered by the Arizona Corporations Commission ordered the respondents to pay the commission of $5,149,316 and an administrative penalty of $100,000. The Commission would disburse the funds on a pro-rata basis to investors. A statement by Pocklington&#x27;s company was included in Canadian media accounts, which stated “the allegations of wrongdoing ... have been laid to rest” with the commission’s decision. &quot;We have done nothing wrong,&quot; Pocklington said in the release. &quot;We have worked diligently and honestly with all of our investors and have been conscientious in guiding the company through the necessary regulatory frameworks. We are committed to raising capital in accordance with existing rules and regulations.&quot; He added that any errors were &quot;born of inexperience and naivete, not malice or avarice&quot;, and were quickly rectified.

On December 6, 2013, a report by the CBC stated that the $5,149,316 fine remains unpaid.

===Edmonton Oilers&#x27; 1984 reunion===
On October 8, 2014, Pocklington was the focus of a media opportunity organized by the Edmonton Oilers Hockey Club to promote the 30-year reunion of the 1984 Stanley Cup championship team. When asked if he was concerned about the reception he would get from Edmontonians, he replied, &quot;I really don&#x27;t give a damn what some of the unwashed have to say.&quot; His comment resulted in a social media storm that continued until his appearance at the October 10 Edmonton Oilers 1985 Stanley Cup Reunion at Rexall Place in Edmonton. Media polls indicated he was in for a rough reception at the event. However, he received a standing ovation from fans in attendance. He subsequently sent letters to the editors of &quot;The Edmonton Sun&quot;. &quot;The Sun&quot; published the letter of thanks intact on October 14, 2014.

==In film, print and social media==
Pocklington has appeared as himself in several television series:
* 30 for 30: King&#x27;s Ransom (2009)
* The top 5 reasons you can&#x27;t blame... The Edmonton Oilers for trading Wayne Gretzky (2005)
* ESPN SportsCentury: 1988 (2002)
* ESPN SportsCentury: Wayne Gretzky (2000)

Pocklington is also the subject of several books:
* &quot;I&#x27;d Trade Him Again: On Gretzky, Politics, and the Pursuit of the Perfect Deal&quot; by Terry McConnell, J&#x27;Lyn Nye, with Peter Pocklington (Fenn Publishing: First hardcover edition, 2009; Second paperback edition, 2010)
* &quot;The Puck Talks Here, The amazing life and turbulent times of Peter Pocklington&quot; by Terry McConnell, J&#x27;Lyn Nye, with Peter Pocklington (Terry McConnell, publisher: Paperback, April 2012; Smashwords eBook, April 2012)
* &quot;I&#x27;d Trade Him Again: Wayne Gretzky &amp; Peter Pocklington&quot; by Terry McConnell, J&#x27;Lyn Nye, with Peter Pocklington (Terry McConnell, publisher: Smashwords eBook, 2012)

On February 24, 2012, a Los Angeles-based social media firm hired by Pocklington posted a series of six videos on &quot;The Official YouTube Channel for Peter Pocklington.&quot; These videos, shot in the living room of Pocklington&#x27;s Palm Desert home, were developed as part of a &quot;reputation management&quot; campaign that included accounts on Twitter (@IamPocklington) and Facebook (Peter Hugh Pocklington).

==Health challenges==
Pocklington has been diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. As a result, he no longer drives and requires others to assist in reading memos or other business correspondence to him. On October 19, 2013, &quot;The Edmonton Sun&quot; reported Pocklington would seek stem-cell treatment for his condition.

<doc id="543709" wikidata="Q2092475" url="?curid=543709" title="Sotajumala">
<text>Sotajumala (Finnish for &quot;Wargod&quot;) was a Finnish death metal band from Jyväskylä, formed in 1998. The band has released four albums, two maxi singles, one single and one split EP (with Torture Killer). They have played a lot of shows in their home country, including Tuska, Jalometalli, Nummirock, Lutakko Liekeissä and Pellavarock festivals. In Finland the band has also toured with Nile, Misery Index and Grave as well as supported Obituary, Napalm Death and Vader at one-off shows. The band split-up in 2016.

==History==
Sotajumala was started by Tomi Otsala and Kosti Orbinski in 1998. In 2000 Arttu Romo, Pete Lapio, Jyrki Häkkinen and Harri Lastu joined the band, thus completing its first full line-up. In September 2001 the band recorded their first release entitled &quot;Sotajumala&quot; which eventually led to Woodcut Records signing the band. Guitarist Pete Lapio left the band shortly thereafter. Singer Harri Lastu also left the band in the late summer of 2002, due to personal issues and was soon replaced by &#x27;105&#x27; (Teijo Hakkola).

During fall 2002 the band entered Watercastle Studio to record four new songs which Woodcut released in early 2003 as &quot;Panssarikolonna&quot;. Drummer Arttu Romo and guitarist Jyrki Häkkinen left the band shortly after the release and session drummer Timo Häkkinen was hired to play on the debut album, which was to be recorded in the fall. Ex-guitarist Pete Lapio joined the band again during the summer.

&quot;Death Metal Finland&quot;, the band&#x27;s debut album was recorded in September 2003 at Sam&#x27;s Workshop in Jyväskylä. After its release in March 2004 the band played a short Scandinavian tour with Rotten Sound and Defleshed with another session drummer, Sami Järvinen. In June 2003 the band played Nummirock festival with bands such as Morbid Angel and Rotten Sound. More line-up changes occurred in August when Timo Häkkinen joined the band full-time and singer Teijo Hakkola was fired. Mynni Luukkainen joined as session singer and the band was able to continue playing shows. In spring 2005 Sotajumala played in Estonia and also did a three show mini-tour in Finland with Grave.

Two new songs were recorded in July 2005 to be released as a split with Torture Killer that October. After these sessions Mynni Luukkainen joined the band as a full-time member. The split CD entered the Finnish single charts at position 10. In August the band played at Jalometalli Metal Music Festival in Oulu.

Sotajumala entered studio once more in late summer 2007 to record their sophomore album, &quot;Teloitus&quot;, which was released in October 2007. Teloitus entered the Finnish album charts at position 17. This was the band&#x27;s last album for Woodcut Records.

To support Teloitus Sotajumala played many shows in Finland, including a four show mini-tour with Nile and Deathchain (December 2007), Finnish Metal Expo (February 2008), Tuska Open Air Metal Festival (June 2008), Pellavarock and Jalometalli Metal Music Festival (August 2008) as well as numerous shows with local bands. They also supported Obituary in August at Nosturi.

As of December 2008 the band was writing material for a new album and announced that they will try not to play any shows before the album is completed. In Sotajumala&#x27;s case this usually doesn&#x27;t work as evident by their performance at Jalometalli Winterfest in February supporting Napalm Death already in February 2009. Their third album &quot;Kuolemanpalvelus&quot; was released on 26 May 2010.

==Musical style==
Musically, the band tends to lean toward the Cannibal Corpse/Florida style of death metal. Lyrical themes revolve around the military history of Finland and war stories in general. The band stresses, &quot;Though the lyrics have their roots in war, they are not meant to provoke or create an image of fascist beliefs. So, Sotajumala does not take any stand with our lyrics to political or other ideologies.&quot;

<text>John Albert Gamble QC, LLB (November 24, 1933 – May 11, 2009) was a Canadian politician. He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Progressive Conservative in the 1979 federal election defeating then Liberal incumbent Barney Danson and re-elected in the 1980 election, representing the riding of York North.

He had a rocky relationship with PC leader Joe Clark. He was a candidate to succeed Clark at the 1983 Progressive Conservative leadership convention, but won only seventeen votes on the first ballot, placing seventh out of eight candidates, and was eliminated. Gamble was known for his extreme anti-communist views. He became so unpopular that he was one of only two Progressive Conservative Members of Parliament to lose their seat in the 1984 general election, which produced a Progressive Conservative landslide, one of the largest majorities in the history of the Canadian House of Commons. (Bill Clarke of Vancouver Quadra was the other; he lost to Prime Minister John Turner, who needed a seat in the House.) Gamble lost to independent candidate Tony Roman, who won support from Liberals dissatisfied with their candidate and Tories who wanted to defeat Gamble.

After failing to win a nomination as a Progressive Conservative candidate for the new riding of Markham, Gamble ran without affiliation in the 1988 election in that district. He received less than five percent of the vote and came in fourth place, behind Progressive Conservative candidate Bill Attewell. On May 31, 1993, Gamble won the Reform Party&#x27;s nomination in Don Valley West for the 1993 federal election, but was expelled by the party (Gamble was replaced by Julian Pope, who lost to John Godfrey) prior to the election because of his links to far-right extremists such as Paul Fromm, Ron Gostick, Wolfgang Droege, and the Heritage Front.

In the 1980s, Gamble was involved with the hard-right World Anti-Communist League as head of its affiliate the &quot;Canadian Freedom Foundation&quot;. According to a report by the Security Intelligence Review Committee, Paul Fromm assisted Gamble in this WACL work. Gamble was later accused of having a role in the diversion of Iran arms profits to the Contras.

==Personal==
Gamble was born in Perth. He worked as a tax lawyer before his political career and was director of the Unionville Home Society. He died in 2009 from leukemia in Markham.

<text>Lakewood, officially the Municipality of Lakewood (; Subanen: &quot;Benwa Danaw&quot;; Chavacano: &quot;Municipalidad de Lakewood&quot;; ), is a municipality in the province of Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 21,559 people.

==Etymology==
The old name of Lakewood is Danaw Likowai and Tubod is Obod. Its name derives from the Cebuano term &quot;tubod&quot; which means &quot;spring&quot;. Its current name derived from Lake Wood, a large lake on which the poblacion is located.

==History==
The municipality was founded on November 11, 1977, when Barangays Gatub and Bagong Kahayag of the Municipality of Kumalarang and Barangays Lakewood, Bolalawan, Sebugay, Bisuangan, Lokoan, Backing, Dagum, Sapang Pinolis, Tubod, Gasa, Tiwales and Matalang of the Municipality of Lapuyan were separated and formed into an independent municipality. The most popular species of fish in the province can only be caught in the lake: the carpa and porang.

<doc id="543719" wikidata="Q5374344" url="?curid=543719" title="Employment Non-Discrimination Act">
<text>The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) is legislation proposed in the United States Congress that would prohibit discrimination in hiring and employment on the basis of sexual orientation or, depending on the version of the bill, gender identity, by employers with at least 15 employees.

ENDA has been introduced in every Congress since 1994 except the 109th. Similar legislation has been introduced without passage since 1974. The bill gained its best chance at passing after the Democratic Party gained the majority after twelve years of Republican majorities in the 2006 midterm elections. In 2007, gender identity protections were added to the legislation for the first time. Some sponsors believed that even with a Democratic majority, ENDA did not have enough votes to pass the House of Representatives with transgender inclusion and dropped it from the bill, which passed the House and then died in the Senate. President George W. Bush threatened to veto the measure. LGBT advocacy organizations and the LGBT community were divided over support of the modified bill.

In 2009, following Democratic gains in the 2008 elections, and after the divisiveness of the 2007 debate, Rep. Barney Frank introduced a transgender-inclusive version of ENDA. He introduced it again in 2011, and Senator Jeff Merkley introduced it in the Senate. On November 7, 2013, Merkley&#x27;s bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support by a vote of 64–32. President Barack Obama supported the bill&#x27;s passage, but the House Rules Committee voted against it.

From 2015 on, LGBT rights advocates moved to support the Equality Act, a bill with far more comprehensive protections than ENDA. The Equality Act would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity not only in employment, but also housing, public accommodations, public education, federal funding, credit, and jury service.

On June 15, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Bostock v. Clayton County&quot; that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity. The ruling was only on employment, like ENDA. LGBT rights advocates welcomed the ruling and called on Congress to pass the Equality Act, noting that as of 2020, 29 states do not have the full protections the Equality Act would provide for the LGBT community.

==Evidence of employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity==

In states that have anti-discrimination policies in place, LGBT complaints are equivalent to the number of complaints filed based on sex and fewer than the number of complaints filed based on race. EEOC statistics from 2018 show that 1,811 LGBT complaints were filed.

The Williams Institute estimates the number of LGBT employees as follows: 7 million private sector employees, 1 million state and local employees, and 200,000 employees of the federal government. Thirty percent of state and local LGBT employees live in California and New York. In comparison, less than half of one half of one percent of LGBT state and local employees live in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming combined. As one might expect, many of the documented complaints of discrimination by state and local governments against LGBT employees are in California and New York. Surveys that seek to document discrimination on the basis of perceived sexual orientation and/or gender identity are often conducted with a pool of self identified LGBT people, making it difficult to ascertain the impact of this type of discrimination on non-LGBT individuals.

One source of evidence for hiring discrimination against openly gay men comes from a field experiment that sent two fictitious but realistic resumes to roughly 1,700 entry-level job openings. The two resumes were very similar in terms of the applicant&#x27;s qualifications, but one resume for each opening mentioned that the applicant had been part of a gay organization in college. The results showed that applicants without the gay signal had an 11.5 percent chance of being called for an interview; openly gay applicants had only a 7.2 percent chance. The callback gap varied widely according to the location of the job. Most of the overall gap detected in the study was driven by the Southern and Midwestern states in the sample – Texas, Florida, and Ohio. The Western and Northeastern states in the sample (California, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and New York) had only small and statistically insignificant callback gaps.

Transgender people may experience higher rates of discrimination than the LGB population. A survey of transgender and gender non-conforming people conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality found 90 percent of respondents experienced harassment, mistreatment, or discrimination on the job or took actions like hiding who they are to avoid it. In comparison, a review of studies conducted by the Williams Institute in 2007 found that transgender people experienced employment discrimination at a rate of between 15 and 57 percent of the population.

In a survey conducted by Harris Interactive, 38 percent of LGBT people report incomes less than $35,000, compared to 33 percent of all U.S. adults over age 18.

==Provisions==
The current version of the bill under consideration in Congress prohibits private employers with more than 15 employees from discriminating on the basis of some sexual orientations or gender identity. Sexual orientation is limited to &quot;homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality,&quot; thereby legalizing discrimination against asexual individuals. Religious organizations are provided an exception, broader than that found in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Non-profit membership-only clubs, except labor unions, are similarly exempt.

All versions of the bill, irrespective of the military&#x27;s changing policies with respect to service by open gays and lesbians, have provided an exclusion for the military as an employer of members of the armed forces, though not as an employer of civilians.

Since the 111th Congress, the legislation has included language to prevent any reading of the law as a modification of the federal definition of marriage established in the Defense of Marriage Act (1995). Since the 110th Congress, a related provision aimed at non-marital legal relations like civil unions and domestic partnerships prevents requiring an employer to treat unmarried and married couples similarly.

==Legislative activity==

On May 14, 1974, Reps. Bella Abzug (D-NY) and Ed Koch (D-NY) introduced , an &quot;Equality Act&quot; which would have added &quot;sex, marital status or sexual orientation&quot; to the protected classes specified in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, thus prohibiting discrimination in employment and access to public accommodations and facilities. The bill died in June 1974 but a similarly named bill would later be introduced in the 115th United States Congress on May 2, 2017.

In the early 1990s, supporters of the legislation decided to focus on employment. Rep. Gerry Studds introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act on June 23, 1994. The legislation failed in 1994 and 1995. In 1996, the bill failed on a 49–50 vote in the Senate and was not voted on in the House. Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy &quot;believed that other senators looking for &#x27;cover&#x27; on their vote in favor of DOMA might be more inclined to support ENDA.&quot; Early versions of ENDA did not include provisions to protect transgender people from discrimination and ENDA was not introduced in the 109th Congress.

===110th Congress===

In the 110th United States Congress there were two versions of the bill, both of which provided employment protections similar to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Reps. Barney Frank, Chris Shays, Tammy Baldwin, and Deborah Pryce introduced on April 24, 2007. It included gender identity within its protections. It defined gender identity as &quot;gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with or without regard to the individual&#x27;s designated sex at birth.&quot; It allowed employers to require adherence &quot;to the same dress or grooming standards for the gender to which the employee has transitioned or is transitioning.&quot;

When that bill died in committee, Frank introduced on September 27, 2007, which did not include gender identity and contained exemptions concerning employer dress codes. It was endorsed by the Education and Labor Committee on October 18 and the House of Representatives passed it on November 7, 2007, by a vote of 235 to 184, with 14 members not voting. Frank introduced a separate piece of legislation to prohibit discrimination in employment on the basis of gender identity.

Some LGBT activist organizations refused to support H.R. 3685 because of its failure to cover gender identity. An exception was the Human Rights Campaign, which received wide criticism from the LGBT community for supporting a non-inclusive ENDA. The LGBT activist organizations that refused to support H.R. 3685 argued that not including transgender people undermined the underlying principle of ENDA. They claimed that failure to include gender identity/expression weakened the protection for the portion of the LGBT population that most needed its protections: gender non-conforming people, who they claimed are discriminated against in greater numbers than their gender-conforming compatriots. Moreover, groups such as the National LGBTQ Task Force, among others, later withdrew support in 2014 due to the ENDA&#x27;s broad religious exemptions. Others argued that this was ENDA&#x27;s best chance of passing Congress in thirty years, that civil rights victories have historically been incremental, that concerns about the legislation&#x27;s protections were unfounded, and that forgoing a chance to provide immediate workplace protections to millions of lesbians, gays and bisexuals was politically and morally wrong.

===111th Congress===
On June 24, 2009, Frank introduced to ban workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, with 114 original cosponsors, up from 62 cosponsors for the trans-inclusive bill of 2007.&quot; The lead Republican cosponsor was Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL). Republican Main Street Partnership members Mark Kirk (R-IL), Mike Castle (R-DE), Todd Russell Platts (R-PA), Judy Biggert (R-IL), and Leonard Lance (R-NJ) were among the original cosponsors. The bill was referred to the House Education and Labor Committee, which held a hearing on the legislation on September 23, 2009. At the end of the 111th Congress, H.R. 3017 had 203 cosponsors in the House.

On August 5, 2009, Sen. Jeff Merkley introduced ENDA legislation () that included gender identity, with 38 original cosponsors including Sens. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Chris Dodd (D-CT). Sen. Merkley said &quot;It&#x27;s certainly possible that this could be passed by year&#x27;s end, though the [congressional] schedule is very crowded.&quot;

The U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee held a hearing on the legislation on November 5, 2009. Before the hearing, Sen. Merkley spoke at a press conference alongside two transgender women, Diane Schroer and Earline Budd. However, no transgender witnesses testified at the Senate hearing. As of March 13, 2010, S. 1584 had 45 co-sponsors and was pending before the HELP committee.

===112th Congress===
On April 6, 2011, Frank introduced an ENDA bill () in the House to ban workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

On April 14, 2011, Sen. Jeff Merkley introduced an ENDA bill () in the Senate. The bill had 39 original cosponsors. On June 19, 2012, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions held a hearing on the bill, the first such hearing to include testimony by a transgender witness.

===113th Congress===

On April 25, 2013, Representative Jared Polis (D-CO) introduced an ENDA bill in the House () and Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) introduced an ENDA bill in the Senate ().

On July 10, 2013, the Senate Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions Committee approved ENDA by a 15–7 vote. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) announced he would offer three amendments when the Senate takes up the measure.

A cloture vote succeeded in the Senate on November 4, 2013, with 61 voting in favor and 30 against, allowing the Senate to schedule a vote. Republican Senators Kelly Ayotte (NH), Susan Collins (ME), Orrin Hatch (UT), Dean Heller (NV), Mark Kirk (IL), Rob Portman (OH), and Pat Toomey (PA) voted for cloture, joining 52 of 53 Democratic senators and both independent senators. Senators Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) supported the legislation, but were unable to attend the cloture vote.

After rejecting by a vote of 43–55 an amendment by Senator Toomey to expand the religious exemptions and accepting by unanimous voice vote an amendment by Senator Portman to prevent government retaliation against religious institutions, the Senate approved ENDA on November 7, 2013, on a 64–32 vote. Arizona Republicans Jeff Flake and John McCain unexpectedly joined Sen. Murkowski and the seven Republicans who had supported three days earlier. Both independents and 52 of 53 Democrats again supported the measure, with McCaskill present but Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, who supported the bill&#x27;s passage, absent.

In the House, on September 17, 2014, Representative Polis filed a discharge petition, that, if signed by a majority of the House membership, would force a vote on the version of ENDA with a narrow religious exemption. By September 22, it had been endorsed by 190 of the 218 that constitute a majority. On December 3, 2014, 6 of the 8 Republican co-sponsors asked House Speaker John Boehner to allow a vote on the legislation &quot;as part of any available legislative vehicle including the National Defense Authorization Act&quot; before the end of the 113th Congress. Later that day, the House Rules Committee voted 7 to 3 against adding ENDA as an amendment to the 2015 defense authorization bill.

===114th Congress onwards===
From the 114th Congress onwards, efforts to pass non-discrimination legislation has focused on the broader Equality Act which focuses on additional protections including in housing and the jury system as well as employment.

==Arguments==

===In favor of ENDA===
Political proponents of the law intend it to address cases where gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender employees have been discriminated against by their employers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Currently, these employees are unable to find protection in the courts because sexual orientation is not considered to be a suspect class by the federal courts and by many U.S. states. Proponents argue that such a law is appropriate in light of the United States Constitution&#x27;s guarantees of equal protection and due process to all. Advocates argue that homosexuality is not a &quot;choice&quot; but a personal identity, a claim supported by the American Psychological Association (APA), and that all working people have a right to be judged by the quality of their work performance and not by completely unrelated factors. According to a study published in 2001 by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, reports of discrimination based on sexual orientation are roughly equal to those on race or gender. The APA also states that there is significant discrimination against homosexual people in the workforce.

The Congressional Budget Office in 2002 estimated that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&#x27;s complaint caseload would rise by 5 to 7% as a result of the proposed law. Assessments of the impact of comparable state policies also show a minimal impact on caseload. Regarding constitutionality, the act incorporates language similar to that of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which has consistently been upheld by the courts.

In 1994, Barry Goldwater, a hero among the conservative and libertarian movements, became honorary chairman of a drive to pass a federal law preventing job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

===In opposition to ENDA===
Ed Vitagliano, director of research for the American Family Association (AFA), expressed concern about the impact of anti-discrimination laws on religious organizations. He cited a lack of clarity around whether the narrow exemption would apply to support staff and lay employees in addition to churches and clergy.

The Traditional Values Coalition (TVC) has claimed that the legislation would have a negative impact on school children by eliminating schools&#x27; ability to avoid hiring transgender teachers. It said that &quot;If ENDA passes, students and children in daycare centers all across the nation will be subjected to individuals experimenting with their gender identities.&quot;

Some libertarians argue that laws against private sector discrimination are acts of coercion that infringe on employers&#x27; property rights and freedom of association.

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said ENDA goes beyond prohibiting unjust discrimination and poses several problems. It notes, for example, that the bill: (1) lacks an exception for a &quot;bona fide occupational qualification,&quot; which exists for every other category of discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, except for race; (2) lacks a distinction between homosexual inclination and conduct, thus affirming and protecting extramarital sexual conduct; (3) supports the redefinition of marriage, as state-level laws like ENDA have been invoked in state court decisions finding marriage discriminatory or irrational; (4) rejects the biological basis of gender by defining &quot;gender identity&quot; as something people may choose at variance with their biological sex; and (5) threatens religious liberty by punishing as discrimination the religious or moral disapproval of same-sex sexual conduct, while protecting only some religious employers.

In June and July 2014, several pro-LGBT advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, National Center for Lesbian Rights, National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Transgender Law Center, and Lambda Legal, announced they were withdrawing support for the 113th Congress version of ENDA because of their concerns about the breadth of its religious exemption in relation to the ruling in &quot;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.&quot;.

==Legislative history==
From the 114th Congress onwards, efforts to pass non-discrimination legislation has focused on the broader Equality Act which focuses on additional protections including in housing and the jury system as well as employment.

<doc id="543721" wikidata="Q173814" url="?curid=543721" title="John Cooper (car maker)">
<text>John Newton Cooper (17 July 1923 – 24 December 2000) was a co-founder, with his father Charles Cooper, of the Cooper Car Company. Born in Surbiton, Surrey, United Kingdom, he became an auto racing legend with his rear-engined chassis design that would eventually change the face of the sport at its highest levels, from Formula One to the Indianapolis 500.

Charles Cooper ran a small garage in Surbiton that specialised in maintaining racing cars. His son John left school at age 15 to become an apprentice toolmaker and served in the Royal Air Force as an instrument maker in World War II. After the war, he and his father began building simple, inexpensive single-seat racers for privateers, often from surplus military hardware. The cars were extremely successful and quickly in high demand, and in 1948, they founded their own company to build more.

In stereotypical British fashion, Cooper always downplayed the story about how they decided to put the engine in the back of their racing cars, insisting it was a matter of convenience. The original design for the first rear-engined Cooper racing car was drawn up by Owen Maddock, a designer employed by Cooper Car Company.
Because the car was powered by a motorcycle engine, they put the engine in the back, driving a chain. &quot;We certainly had no feeling that we were creating some scientific breakthrough!...We put the engine at the rear...because it was the practical thing to do,&quot; Cooper said.

Initially, John raced his own cars on a regular basis, but as the company grew, he found less time available to compete. He did, however, find time to set a number of records at Montlhéry at the end of 1953.

In the early 1950s, it seemed as if every aspiring young British racing driver began behind the wheel of a Cooper, and Cooper&#x27;s Formula One cars were driven by the legendary drivers of the time – Jack Brabham, Stirling Moss, Maurice Trintignant, and Bruce McLaren. In a nine-year period, the team took 16 Grand Prix wins, as Brabham and the team won back-to-back World Championships in 1959 and 1960.

While in Sebring, Florida, for the 1959 United States Grand Prix, Cooper got to know American driver Rodger Ward, the reigning USAC national champion and Indianapolis 500 winner. After Ward had been astounded by the cornering ability of Cooper&#x27;s little cars on the road course, he offered to arrange a test for them at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, saying, &quot;You&#x27;ve got to try out your car around the Oval. Indy&#x27;s waiting for you!&quot; Cooper took one of his Formula One cars to the Speedway in the autumn of 1960, as drivers, constructors and racing personalities gathered in &quot;amused tolerance, mixed with obvious curiosity,&quot; according to Cooper. When Brabham, an Indy rookie, began his warmup laps, he was unaware of the requirement to gradually build up his speed on the track. He clocked his second lap at 144.8 miles per hour, fast enough for the third row on the previous race&#x27;s grid! Ward was so enthused, Cooper had to agree to let him drive the car, too. From that point, the Indianapolis establishment realised the writing was on the wall and the days of their front-engined roadsters were numbered. Within a few years, John Cooper&#x27;s revolution of open-wheeled racing was complete.

Cooper&#x27;s development of the British Motor Corporation Mini – the Mini Cooper – was adored by both rally racers and ordinary road drivers. Before John Cooper&#x27;s death, the Cooper name was licensed to BMW for the higher-performance versions of the cars, inspired by the original Mini, sold as the MINI. John, along with his son Mike Cooper, served in an advisory role to BMW and Rover&#x27;s New MINI design team.

Cooper was the last surviving Formula One team principal from the formative years of the sport, and he often lamented later in life that the fun had long since gone out of racing. He helped establish Britain&#x27;s domination of motorsport technology, which continues today, and he received the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to British motorsport. He remained head of the West Sussex family garage business (which had outlets for Mini Cooper at East Preston and Honda at Ferring) until his death at age 77 in 2000.

<text>Neil Fraser (born ) is a Canadian former civil servant who came to prominence for his crusade against the Metric system of weights and measures in the early 1980s, which resulted in him being fired from his post in the Department of National Revenue on February 23, 1982. 

==Legal battle==
Fraser fought his dismissal with the Public Service Staff Relations Board in April 1982, but the board ruled that his dismissal was justified. He appealed the board&#x27;s decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, who dismissed his appeal in November 1982. Fraser then appealed this decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. The Court dismissed Fraser&#x27;s appeal, agreeing that while public servants are allowed to express some degree of government criticism, it is possible to go so far as to impair the ability to do the job properly. The Court stated that Fraser&#x27;s criticisms took on a &quot;vitriolic tone, even to the point of being vicious&quot; and he refused to stop.

==Candidate for 1983 Progressive Conservative leadership==
To promote his campaign against the Metric system, he ran as a candidate for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada at the 1983 leadership convention.

Fraser&#x27;s campaign had no visible followers. Granted the same nationally televised 25 minutes as the other candidates for his convention address, Fraser engaged in a bizarre speech that likened Confederation to a blood transfusion to Quebec. Lise Bissonnette commented that if the speech had been heard on Radio-Canada, it would have set the Tories&#x27; Quebec efforts back 10 years. He finished last, with five votes.

<text>Jean-Robert Argand (, , ; July 18, 1768 – August 13, 1822) was a Genevan amateur mathematician. In 1806, while managing a bookstore in Paris, he published the idea of geometrical interpretation of complex numbers known as the Argand diagram and is known for the first rigorous proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

==Life==

Jean-Robert Argand was born in Geneva, then Republic of Geneva, to Jacques Argand and Eve Carnac. His background and education are mostly unknown. Since his knowledge of mathematics was self-taught and he did not belong to any mathematical organizations, he likely pursued mathematics as a hobby rather than a profession.

Argand moved to Paris in 1806 with his family and, when managing a bookshop there, privately published his &quot;Essai sur une manière de représenter les quantités imaginaires dans les constructions géométriques&quot; (Essay on a method of representing imaginary quantities). In 1813, it was republished in the French journal &quot;Annales de Mathématiques&quot;. The Essay discussed a method of graphing complex numbers via analytical geometry. It proposed the interpretation of the value as a rotation of 90 degrees in the Argand plane. In this essay he was also the first to propose the idea of modulus to indicate the magnitude of vectors and complex numbers, as well as the notation for vectors formula_1. The topic of complex numbers was also being studied by other mathematicians, notably Carl Friedrich Gauss and Caspar Wessel. Wessel&#x27;s 1799 paper on a similar graphing technique did not attract attention.

Argand is also renowned for delivering a proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra in his 1814 work &quot;Réflexions sur la nouvelle théorie d&#x27;analyse&quot; (Reflections on the new theory of analysis). It was the first complete and rigorous proof of the theorem, and was also the first proof to generalize the fundamental theorem of algebra to include polynomials with complex coefficients.

The first textbook containing a proof of the theorem was Cauchy&#x27;s &quot;Cours d&#x27;analyse de l&#x27;École Royale Polytechnique&quot; (1821). It contained Argand&#x27;s proof, although Argand is not credited for it. And the proof was later referenced in Chrystal&#x27;s influential textbook &quot;Algebra&quot;.

Argand died of an unknown cause on August 13, 1822, in Paris. In 1978 his proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra was called by The Mathematical Intelligencer “both ingenious and profound.”
