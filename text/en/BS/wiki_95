<text>Polenta (, ) is an Italian dish of boiled cornmeal that was historically made from other grains. It may be allowed to cool and solidify into a loaf that can be baked, fried, or grilled.

The variety of cereal used is usually yellow maize, but often buckwheat, white maize, or mixtures thereof may be used. Coarse grinds make a firm, coarse polenta; finer grinds make a soft, creamy polenta. Polenta is a staple of both northern and, to a lesser extent, central Italian, Swiss Italian, southern French, Slovenian, Romanian and, due to Italian migrants, Brazilian and Argentinian cuisine. It is often mistaken for the Slovene-Croatian food named &quot;žganci&quot;. Its consumption was traditionally associated with lower classes, as in times past cornmeal mush was an essential food in their everyday nutrition.

==Etymology==

Polenta covered any hulled and crushed grain, especially barley-meal, and is derived from the Latin &quot;pollen&quot; for &#x27;fine flour&#x27;, which shares a root with &quot;pulvis&quot;, meaning &#x27;dust&#x27;.

==History==
As it is known today, polenta derives from earlier forms of grain mush (known as or in Latin) that were commonly eaten since Roman times. Before the introduction of corn (maize) from America in the 16th century, it was made from starchy ingredients such as farro, chestnut flour, millet, spelt, and chickpeas.

Polenta was brought to the south of Brazil by Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and has become an important part of Italian-Brazilian culture and identity in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Paraná. The fried version, though, has become popular even in other regions that did not receive Italian migration and is a popular snack and finger food in bars across the country.

==Cooking time==
Polenta takes a long time to cook, simmering in four to five times its volume of watery liquid for about 45 minutes with near-constant stirring; this is necessary for even gelatinization of the starch. Some alternative cooking techniques have been invented to speed up the process or not require constant supervision. Quick-cooking (pre-cooked, instant) polenta is widely used and is prepared in just a few minutes; it is considered inferior to polenta made from unprocessed cornmeal and is best eaten after being baked or fried. In his book &quot;Heat&quot;, Bill Buford talks about his experiences as a line cook in Mario Batali&#x27;s Italian restaurant Babbo. Buford details the differences in taste between instant polenta and slow-cooked polenta and describes a method of preparation that takes up to three hours but does not require constant stirring: &quot;polenta, for most of its cooking, is left unattended. ... If you don&#x27;t have to stir it all the time, you can cook it for hours—what does it matter, as long as you&#x27;re nearby?&quot;. &quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot; magazine has described a method using a microwave oven that reduces cooking time to 12 minutes and requires only a single stirring. In March 2010, it presented a stovetop, near-stir-less method that uses a pinch of baking soda (an alkali), which replicates the traditional effect.

<text>Mülheim, officially Mülheim an der Ruhr (; ; ) and also described as &quot;City on the River&quot;, is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. It is located in the Ruhr Area between Duisburg, Essen, Oberhausen and Ratingen. It is home to many companies, and two Max Planck Institutes.

Mülheim an der Ruhr received its town charter in 1808, and 100 years later the population exceeded 100,000, making Mülheim officially a city. At the time of the city&#x27;s 200th anniversary with approximately 170,000 residents, it was counted among the smaller cities of Germany.

==Geography==

===Geographical location===
Mülheim an der Ruhr is located to the southwest of Essen in the Ruhr valley.

===Geology===

The northern foothills of the Rhenish Massif are characterised by the distinctive rock formation of the bare mountain slopes through which run coal-bearing layers which formed during the carboniferous period. Here the Ruhr cuts more than 50 meters deep into this Mittelgebirge. This natural erosion partly uncovered these mineable black coal deposits, which enabled their exploration and extraction using adits. However, the coal-rich layers became ever deeper as one progressed northward, which required setting up mines to extract the black coal. In contrast, the broad bayou (dead arm of a river) of Styrum borough is characteristic of the features of the Lower Rhine Plain.

==Transport==
The U18 metro line connects the city with Essen.

==Politics==
===Mayor===
The current mayor of Mülheim is Marc Buchholz of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, with a runoff held on 27 September, and the results were as follows:

<text>CHRO-TV (analogue channel 5) is a television station licensed to Pembroke, Ontario, Canada, serving the capital city of Ottawa as part of the CTV 2 system. It is owned and operated by Bell Media alongside CTV outlet CJOH-DT (channel 13). The two stations share studios with Bell&#x27;s Ottawa radio properties at the Market Media Mall building on George Street in downtown Ottawa&#x27;s ByWard Market; CHRO-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on TV Tower Road near Pembroke. The station operates a digital-only rebroadcaster in Ottawa, CHRO-DT-43 (channel 43), with transmitter in the city&#x27;s Herbert Corners section.

==History==
The station first went on the air on August 19, 1961, as CHOV-TV, a CBC Television affiliate owned by Gordon Archibald Ottawa Valley Broadcasting, the owner of AM radio station CHOV. Workers of the station unionized and a labour dispute began. A financial crisis in 1976 led to the station going dark for six days in August of that year. Ottawa Valley sold the station to J. Conrad Lavigne in 1977. Lavigne adopted the CHRO-TV callsign, and opened a sales office for the station in Ottawa. Lavigne&#x27;s company subsequently became part of the MCTV system in 1980. While most of the MCTV stations used &quot;MCTV&quot;, rather than their call letters, as their on-air branding, CHRO continued to use its call sign, although it used the same logo and programming schedule as the other MCTV stations.

In 1986, MCTV filed an application to expand the service by disaffiliating from the CBC and adding a transmitter and broadcasting facilities in Ottawa, although the application process instead resulted in Baton Broadcasting being given a license to launch a new independent station in Ottawa. Standard Broadcasting, the owners of existing Ottawa television station CJOH-TV, responded to the potential new competition by selling CJOH to Baton, who then surrendered the new independent license. As a result, Mid-Canada submitted a revived application in 1989, but the application was withdrawn after Northern Cable, the owner of the MCTV system, underwent an ownership change to be financed by selling off its broadcasting assets.
In 1990, Baton Broadcasting acquired the MCTV stations. Because CHRO was carried by cable television companies in the Ottawa market, this was deemed an ownership conflict for Baton, which already owned Ottawa&#x27;s CJOH, and would therefore have a &quot;de facto&quot; twinstick in competition with the CBC&#x27;s CBOT-TV (channel 4). However, the station&#x27;s carriage in Ottawa was also deemed essential to its survival, since Pembroke was too small a market to support the station on its own. Therefore, CHRO disaffiliated from the CBC, and became a CTV affiliate. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) also ordered strict controls on CHRO&#x27;s programming, so that Baton could not gain unfair audience advantage in Ottawa by airing shows at different times on CHRO and CJOH. Baton eventually became the sole corporate proprietor of CTV.

===As The New RO===

In 1997, CHRO was one of several stations transferred to CHUM Limited in exchange for the ATV stations in Atlantic Canada. (Ironically, CHUM had been one of the applicants for the independent license that eventually went to Baton in the late 1980s; they would have launched a station similar to CITY-TV in Toronto, and even produced a pitch film. CITY itself would set up an Ottawa re-transmitter in 1996.) CHRO did not have an over-the-air transmitter in Ottawa until it came under CHUM&#x27;s ownership. CHUM received approval from the CRTC to add a transmitter at Ottawa on channel 43 with the effective radiated power of 231,000 watts to rebroadcast the signal of CHRO-TV Pembroke. Ten months being acquired by CHUM, on September 7, 1998, CHRO was rebranded to &quot;The New RO&quot; and joined the NewNet system.

During its first two years under NewNet affiliation, CHRO began moving their operations away from their original Pembroke studios. They initially operated from a small studio at 10 Kimway Avenue, near CJOH&#x27;s broadcast facility on Merivale Road. In October 2000, the station moved to a brand-new media complex, dubbed the &quot;CHUM MarketMediaMall&quot;, in Ottawa&#x27;s historic ByWard Market neighborhood at 87 George Street. In addition to a &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Corner&quot; video booth, the facility also housed CHUM&#x27;s Ottawa-area radio stations (CKKL-FM, CJMJ-FM, CFRA and CFGO).

In February 2005, CHUM announced plans to consolidate the master control departments for CHRO, CKVR-DT, CFPL-DT, CHWI-DT and CKNX-TV at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, and to consolidate the traffic and programming departments at CFPL in London, resulting in the loss of approximately 19 staff members from CHRO. On June 3, 2005, at approximately 10:30 a.m., the Pembroke master control signal came to an end, as the new consolidated master control took to air.

===As A-Channel Ottawa===

The station was renamed A-Channel on August 2, 2005, along with the rest of the NewNet system, and began using the same logo as the rest of the system as well.

On July 12, 2006, CTV owner Bell Globemedia (now Bell Media) announced plans to purchase CHUM Limited for C$1.7 billion, with plans to divest itself of the A-Channel and Access Alberta stations. On the same date, CHRO cancelled its noon-hour lifestyles program and its 12:30 p.m. weekday newscast, citing low ratings and declining advertising revenues. Anchors James Hendricks and Dave Gross were also let go. A plan was announced to almost fully automate the station&#x27;s news production system, which would see a few dozen staff members laid off by the start of the new year.

On April 9, 2007, Rogers Media announced an agreement to purchase all of the A-Channel stations including CHRO, , Canadian Learning Television and Access Alberta. The deal was contingent on full approval by the CRTC of the CTVglobemedia takeover of CHUM. With CRTC approval being contingent on the sale of the Citytv stations instead, Rogers bought the Citytv stations and CTV kept the A-Channel stations. The takeover transaction was completed on June 22.

With the CHUM acquisition, CTV became the only English-language private television broadcaster offering Ottawa news coverage; it owns both CHRO and CJOH-TV, which compete only with the CBC&#x27;s CBOT in offering local news. The CRTC&#x27;s decision to allow the joint ownership of CJOH and CHRO appeared to contradict its own rationale for forcing CTV to sell the Citytv stations, specifically that a single company could not own two stations, in the same language, based in the same large urban centre – however, even before CTV confirmed it would keep CHRO, the twinstick was approved by the CRTC on the basis of CHRO&#x27;s financial situation and the stations&#x27; prior common ownership (until 1997).

===As A Ottawa===

The station was rebranded as A on August 11, 2008, along with the rest of the A-Channel system. The A soft launch began earlier in June 2008 in CHRO-TV&#x27;s press materials and local newscasts.

Due to a major fire that destroyed the longtime studios of sister CTV station CJOH-TV on Merivale Road in Nepean on February 7, 2010, CJOH integrated its operations with CHRO into the latter station&#x27;s studios at 87 George Street in Ottawa&#x27;s ByWard Market (which was already occupied by CHRO). As a result, CJOH&#x27;s newscasts began to be produced from the facility, becoming the first time since the studios had any nighttime newscasts since the cancellation of CHRO&#x27;s &quot;A News&quot; broadcasts in 2009.

===As CTV Two/CTV 2 Ottawa===

On May 30, 2011, Bell Media announced that the A television system would be rebranded as CTV Two, with CHRO switching its branding from &quot;A Ottawa&quot; to &quot;CTV Two Ottawa&quot;. The official relaunch to CTV Two took place on August 29, 2011. In addition, CHRO&#x27;s morning show, &quot;A Morning&quot; was renamed &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot;. In addition, CHRO started broadcasting in high definition as part of the relaunched system on August 31, 2011.

==Past programming==
* &quot;Ottawa Senators Hockey&quot; (20 regular-season games a year of the Canadian capital city&#x27;s NHL team, which were usually, but not always, broadcast on Thursday evenings) – with Dean Brown as play-by-play announcer and Gord Wilson as commentator. Games were broadcast through the 2007–08 season, after which games were moved back exclusively to Sportsnet East, and later TSN5 (also owned by CHRO parent company Bell Media)
* &quot;Bob TV&quot;
* &quot;Majic 100 Top 20 Countdown&quot;
*&quot;Speaker&#x27;s Corner Ottawa&quot;

==News operation==
CHRO presently broadcasts 22 hours of locally produced newscasts each week, all consisting of four hours each weekday and two hours on Saturdays of a local version of CTV&#x27;s local morning news program franchise &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot;.

Over the course of 1998, new graphics and presentation elements were added to the existing newscast that had been produced in Pembroke, and several reporters were forced out. By the summer, the only on-air staff in Pembroke were four anchors; the entire reporting staff was based in Ottawa. On September 7, coinciding with the change to The New RO, CHRO relaunched its news as &quot;NewsSixOttawa&quot;. The station dismissed Cathy Cox, who had been the lead anchor in Pembroke for seven years. The new Ottawa-based anchor team consisted of Caroline Redekopp and former CKVR anchor Robert Maxwell, with Ken Evraire on sports, former Weather Channel anchor Elissa Lansdell on weather and entertainment, and weekend anchor James Hendricks covering traffic and crime from the assignment desk. Cyndi Edwards hosted the &quot;New RO at Noon&quot;, which featured a mix of news, lifestyle and entertainment reports. Reporter Sandra Blaikie, who joined CHRO in 2000, took over from Caroline Redekopp after her departure in 2002. James Hendricks—by now the 11 p.m. anchor—replaced Robert Maxwell after his resignation in autumn 2003. Hendricks also continued to anchor the late news until Cory Atkins (late of CFRN-TV Edmonton) signed on to be the new 11 p.m. anchor in April 2004.

In January 2007, CHRO began producing its newscasts with a new system called &quot;Ross Overdrive&quot; – an automated production system that replaced the need for a switcher, VTR operator, graphics operator and many other staffers. Some 25 staffers were affected by the change, which had been announced some six months earlier.

On March 3, 2009, CTVglobemedia cancelled almost all of CHRO&#x27;s local news programming except for &quot;A Morning&quot;, laying off 34 Ottawa employees. CTVglobemedia cited the current recession as a reason for cancelling the local news programming. In contrast, the A stations in Victoria, Barrie and London kept their evening newscasts but instead, had their morning shows cancelled; this was likely because CTV&#x27;s CJOH-TV also owned by CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media) already produces higher-rated evening newscasts serving the Ottawa market.

In order to comply with the station&#x27;s CRTC-mandated local programming expectation of hours per week, the morning show was extended to four hours a day on weekdays, with a two-hour Saturday edition added as well (CHRO also continues two one-hour weekend music video programs co-branded with local Bell Media Radio stations). Some high-profile CHRO personalities such as Sandra Blaikie, Tony Grace and Bill Welychka were moved to the extended morning show following the March 2009 layoffs. In December 2009, anchor Sandra Blaikie left the station to pursue other interests outside broadcasting, because of the uncertain future of local television in Canada. In September 2010, late evening anchor and national reporter Tony Grace left the station to assume the 6 p.m. anchor position at CKVR in Barrie. In August 2011, Bill Welychka was let go from CHRO. In early September 2011, national reporter Jennifer Madigan left the station as all CTV Two stations began using &quot;CTV National News&quot; resources for national and international stories.

==Technical information==

===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, CHRO&#x27;s Ottawa transmitter, CHRO-TV-43, ceased analog transmissions and began broadcasting in digital on its former analogue allocation of UHF channel 43. CHRO&#x27;s main transmitter in Pembroke is not yet required to switch to digital, since the CRTC did not designate Pembroke as a mandatory market.

===Spectrum reallocation===
As part of the 2016 United States wireless spectrum auction, channels 38 through 51 were removed from television broadcasting in the United States and Canada. CHRO-DT-43 was reassigned from channel 43 to channel 35, using virtual channel 43. The change was completed on July 3, 2020.

<doc id="560209" wikidata="Q77480" url="?curid=560209" title="Konrad von Würzburg">
<text>Konrad von Würzburg (c.1220-1230 – 31 August 1287) was the chief German poet of the second half of the 13th century.

As his name suggests, Konrad hailed from the Franconian town of Würzburg. By the standards of medieval poets, his life is unusually well documented. He spent part of his life in Strasbourg and his later years in Basel, where owned a house. The names of his wife and daughters are recorded. He died in Basel in 1287. Like Gottfried von Strassburg, whom he admired, but unlike most other poets from the time, Konrad did not belong to the nobility. His varied and voluminous literary work is comparatively free from the degeneration which set in so rapidly in Middle High German poetry during the 13th century.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;[h]is style, although occasionally diffuse, is dignified in tone; his metre is clearly influenced by Gottfried&#x27;s tendency to relieve the monotony of the epic-metre with ingenious variations, but it is always correct; his narratives—if we except &quot;Die halbe Birn&quot;, of which the authorship is doubtful—are free from coarseness, to which the popular poets at this time were prone, and, although mysticism and allegory bulk largely in his works, they were not allowed, as in so many of his contemporaries, to usurp the place of poetry.&quot;

Konrad wrote a number of legends (&quot;Alexius&quot;, &quot;Silvester&quot;, &quot;Pantaleon&quot;) illustrating Christian virtues and dogma; &quot;Der Welt Lohn&quot;, a didactic allegory on the familiar theme of Frau Welt, the woman beautiful in front, but unsightly and loathsome from behind. &quot;Die goldene Schmiede&quot; is a panegyric of the Virgin Mary; the &quot;Klage der Kunst&quot;, an allegorical defence of poetry. &quot;Herzmaere&quot; is an story on the eaten heart. It tells of the relationship between a knight and married noblewoman who had a jealous husband. After the knight died during a pilgrimage to the Holy Land his squire attempted to deliver the knight&#x27;s heart to his lover. The husband saw the squire before, ordered the heart to be prepared in a tasty manner and gave it to his wife, the lover of the knight. When she became aware of the whole story, she died.

His most ambitious works are two enormously long epics, &quot;Der trojanische Krieg&quot; (consisting of more than 40,000 verses, and unfinished) and &quot;Partenopier und Meliur&quot;, both of which are based on French originals. Konrad&#x27;s talents are best showcased however in his shorter verse romances, such as &quot;Engelhart und Engeltrut&quot;, &quot;Kaiser Otto&quot; and &quot;Das Herzemaere&quot;; the latter, the theme of which has been made familiar to modern readers by Uhland in his &quot;Kastellan von Coucy&quot;, is one of the best poems of its kind in Middle High German literature.

There is no complete collection available of Konrad&#x27;s works. Some examples are:
*&quot;Der trojanische Krieg&quot; was edited by A von Keller for the &quot;Stuttgart Literarische Verein&quot; (1858)
*&quot;Partonopier und Meliur&quot;, by K Bartsch (1871)
*&quot;Die goldene Schniede&quot; and &quot;Silvester&quot;, by W Grimm (1840 and 1841)
*&quot;Alexius&quot;, by HF Massmann (1843) and R Haczynski (1898)
*&quot;Der Welt Lohn&quot;, by F Roth (1843)
*&quot;Engelhart und Engeltrut&quot;, by Moritz Haupt (1844, 2nd ed., 1890)
*&quot;Klage der Kunst&quot;, by E Joseph (1885).

The shorter poems, &quot;Otto&quot; and &quot;Herzemaere&quot;, can be found in &quot;Erzählungen und Schwänke des Mittelalters&quot;, edited by H Lambel (2nd ed., 1883). Later German translations of Konrad&#x27;s most popular poems were published by K Pannier and H Kruger in &quot;Reclams Universalbibliothek&quot; (1879-1891).

<text>WBTV (channel 3) is a television station in Charlotte, North Carolina, United States, affiliated with CBS and owned by Gray Media. The station&#x27;s studios are located off Morehead Street, just west of Uptown Charlotte, and its transmitter is located in north-central Gaston County. In addition, WBTV&#x27;s studios continue to house the operations of its former sister radio stations currently owned by Urban One: WBT-AM/FM and WLNK, as well as WFNZ, which was previously owned by CBS Radio prior to its acquisition by Beasley Broadcast Group in 2014, followed by Entercom (now known as Audacy) in late 2017 and then Urban One in 2020 under a local marketing agreement.

==History==
The station first signed on the air on July 15, 1949. When it debuted, WBTV was the 13th television station in the United States and the first in the Carolinas; it is the oldest television station located between Richmond and Atlanta. Veteran Charlotte broadcaster Jim Patterson was the first person seen on the station, and remained employed there until his death in 1986. WBTV was originally owned by the Greensboro-based Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company, then-owners of WBT (1110 AM), the city&#x27;s oldest radio station and the first fully licensed station in the South. At the time, the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company also had a 16.5% interest in the Greensboro News Company, licensee of WFMY-TV, which signed on from Greensboro two months after WBTV. Jefferson Standard had purchased WBT from CBS in 1947. Shortly before the television station went on the air, its call letters were modified from WBT-TV to WBTV. Jefferson Standard merged with Pilot Life in 1968 (although it had owned controlling interest since 1945) and became Jefferson-Pilot Corporation. In 1970, the media interests were folded into a new subsidiary, Jefferson-Pilot Communications.

WBTV received one of the last construction permits issued before the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s (FCC) &quot;freeze&quot; on new television licenses, which lasted until the Commission released its &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot; in 1952. As such, it was Charlotte&#x27;s only VHF station for eight years, carrying affiliations with all four major networks of the time—CBS, NBC, ABC and DuMont. However, WBTV has always been a primary CBS affiliate, owing to WBT radio&#x27;s long affiliation with the CBS Radio Network. It is the only commercial television station in the market that has never changed its primary affiliation.

Channel 3 had originally operated from a converted radio studio in the Wilder Building, alongside its sister radio station. In 1955, WBT and WBTV moved to a then state-of-the-art facility on a hill atop Morehead Street, where both stations are still based today. The studio address, One Julian Price Place, is named in honor of the executive who effectively founded Jefferson Standard/Jefferson-Pilot through an early-20th century merger.

WBTV&#x27;s only competition in its early years came from a UHF station on channel 36, known as WAYS-TV and then WQMC-TV, which broadcast briefly from 1953 to 1955. It was nominally an NBC affiliate, sharing a secondary ABC affiliation with channel 3. However, channel 36&#x27;s signal was severely weak, and NBC continued to allow WBTV to cherry-pick its stronger programming. Channel 36 went dark in March 1955, and DuMont shut down roughly a year later in August 1956. Channel 3 took on secondary affiliations with NBC and ABC until Charlotte&#x27;s second VHF station, WSOC-TV (channel 9), took the NBC affiliation when it signed on in April 1957. Channel 36 returned to the air in November 1964 as WCCB (later moving to channel 18 in November 1966), carrying whatever CBS programs that WBTV turned down in order to carry ABC programs. ABC programming continued to be split among the three stations until 1967, when WCCB became a full-time ABC affiliate.
From 1958 to 1974, WBTV&#x27;s studio facilities served as the home for Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling telecasts. Since its completion in 1984, WBTV&#x27;s signal has been transmitted from a -high guy-wired aerial mast transmitter tower located in north-central Gaston County, North Carolina, which is also shared with former radio sister WLNK.

When WAGA-TV in Atlanta, which signed on the air four months before WBTV, switched to Fox in December 1994, WBTV became the longest-tenured CBS affiliate located south of Washington, D.C. WFMY-TV in Greensboro, the second-oldest station in the Carolinas, is the network&#x27;s second-longest tenured affiliate south of the capital; it signed on three months after WBTV. Two years later, after KPIX-TV in San Francisco became a CBS owned-and-operated station (due to owner Westinghouse Electric Corporation&#x27;s merger with CBS), WBTV became the second longest-tenured affiliate that was not owned by the network, behind only Washington&#x27;s WUSA.

Jefferson Standard/Jefferson-Pilot acquired several other radio and television stations across the country, with WBTV serving as the company&#x27;s flagship station. The first was WBTW in Florence, South Carolina, which was built and signed on in 1954; indeed, the call letters were chosen specifically because &quot;W&quot; is the next letter in the alphabet after &quot;V&quot;. The two stations were separately programmed, but shared a microwave system from 1959 onward. Jefferson-Pilot sold WBTW in 1968 because WBTW provided a fairly strong grade B signal to the eastern portion of the Charlotte market, and neither station would have been able to expand their signals as long as Jefferson-Pilot owned both of them.

In 2006, Jefferson-Pilot merged with the Philadelphia-based Lincoln National Corporation. Lincoln Financial retained Jefferson-Pilot&#x27;s broadcasting division, which was renamed Lincoln Financial Media, with WBTV retaining its status as the flagship station.

===Sale to Raycom Media===
On November 12, 2007, Lincoln Financial announced its intention to sell WBTV, sister stations WWBT in Richmond and WCSC-TV in Charleston, South Carolina, and Lincoln Financial Sports, to Raycom Media for $583 million. Lincoln Financial also sold its Charlotte radio stations to Braintree, Massachusetts–based Greater Media, effectively breaking up Charlotte&#x27;s last co-owned radio/television station combination. According to &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; TV critic Mark Washburn, Lincoln Financial decided soon after taking over the former Jefferson-Pilot properties that it would never really be able to integrate them with the rest of the company&#x27;s assets, and had decided to sell them as soon as possible. The sale of the radio stations was finalized on January 31, 2008. However, WBTV still shares the Julian Price Place studio with its former radio sisters, and they also retain a news partnership.

The FCC approved the sale of WBTV on March 25, 2008, and Raycom formally took control of the station on April 1. With the purchase, WBTV became Raycom&#x27;s second-largest station by market size, behind the Cleveland, Ohio duopoly of WOIO and WUAB. Since Raycom Sports is headquartered in Charlotte, WBTV had a very important role in Raycom Media&#x27;s operations, and it shared its flagship status with NBC affiliate WSFA, located in the company&#x27;s homebase of Montgomery, Alabama.

In early 2008, Raycom Sports and Lincoln Financial Sports officially merged under the Raycom Sports banner. The merger coincided with the start of the 2008 Atlantic Coast Conference basketball season. WBTV had been Charlotte&#x27;s home station for ACC sporting events since C. D. Chesley piped in North Carolina&#x27;s historic win in the 1957 NCAA tournament to channel 3 and several other television stations in the state. Raycom had produced ACC basketball games in partnership with Jefferson-Pilot/Lincoln Financial since 1982. The partnership was extended to football in 2004; Jefferson-Pilot/Lincoln Financial had been the sole producer of ACC football telecasts since 1984. From 2010 onward, the package was branded as the ACC Network.

In mid-May 2008, the former Jefferson-Pilot/Lincoln Financial stations launched redesigned websites, powered by the Local Media network division of WorldNow (which operates nearly all of the websites of Raycom&#x27;s stations), assuming web platform operations from Broadcast Interactive Media. However, WBTV and WWBT retained their Jefferson-Pilot/Lincoln Financial-era logos and branding (WCSC has since changed its logo and graphics, following its switch to high definition newscasts). WBTV changed its logo, in use since 2001, on September 7, 2023. The new logo incorporates the &quot;GrayONE&quot; graphics package used by most Gray stations.

On November 15, 2013, both WBTV and WBT were dedicated with a North Carolina historical marker at the corner of Tryon and Third Streets (reading &quot;WBT/WBTV – Oldest broadcast stations in North Carolina established 1922. WBT radio long hosted live country music. WBTV sign-on, July 15, 1949. Studios here until 1955&quot;). The Wilder Building, which was demolished in 1983, served as WBTV&#x27;s studio facilities from 1949 to 1955.

===Sale to Gray Television===
On June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom&#x27;s 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including WBTV), and Gray&#x27;s 93 television stations) under Gray&#x27;s corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion—in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom—resulted in WBTV gaining new in-state sister stations, including NBC affiliates WECT in Wilmington and WITN-TV in the Washington–Greenville market, in addition to its current Raycom sister stations. The sale was approved on December 20, and was completed on January 2, 2019. As was the case with Raycom, WBTV became Gray&#x27;s second-largest station by market size, after Cleveland&#x27;s WOIO/WUAB. Since Gray acquired WAGA&#x27;s successor as Atlanta&#x27;s CBS affiliate, WGCL-TV (now WANF) as its flagship, WBTV has been Gray&#x27;s third-largest station.

===2022 helicopter crash===
On November 22, 2022, at 11:57 a.m., a 1999 Robinson R44 helicopter nicknamed &quot;WBTV Sky3&quot; crashed onto the grass verge of I-77 in south Charlotte during a training exercise. Both occupants, WBTV pilot Chip Tayag and WBTV meteorologist Jason Myers, were pronounced dead at the scene. WBTV anchors Molly Grantham and Jamie Boll covered the incident live on the air, before receiving confirmation it was their own station&#x27;s helicopter and crewmen involved in the crash; the station released a statement citing the incident as a &quot;terrible loss&quot; to the WBTV family. WBTV received an immediate outpouring of support from the community, sister stations, and other media outlets; Governor Roy Cooper and Pastor Franklin Graham posted condolences on social media, and the Carolina Panthers and Charlotte FC delayed their 2022 Christmas tree lighting ceremony at Bank of America Stadium for a moment of silence in honor of Tayag and Myers.

Witnesses to the crash claim the helicopter was visibly faltering, and in a steeply-banked spiral as it came down. Witnesses also claim that Tayag, a pilot with over 20 years of experience, deliberately steered the falling helicopter into the grass to avoid crashing into nearby buildings or onto the Interstate itself, which was crowded with Thanksgiving week traffic at the time. The FAA and NTSB began an investigation into the incident; the preliminary findings of this investigation, coupled with the available RadarBox data, indicated that the helicopter was initially traveling at , and made three 360-degree turns just before it crashed. Tayag, the pilot, never issued any distress signal, though he was in contact with CLT air traffic control moments before the crash. A further NTSB report released May 2, 2024, stated &quot;inadequate inspections&quot; did not reveal loose parts; these likely caused a loss of control, leading to the crash.

On March 6, 2023, the family of Jason Myers filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Wilson Air Center in North Carolina; this lawsuit was later expanded to include a claim of negligence against Total Traffic and Weather Network and iHeartMedia, who employed Chip Tayag and were responsible for the maintenance of the helicopter. The lawsuit alleged that the helicopter was poorly maintained, leading to the crash. That case was dismissed but a trial for helicopter owner TTWN and iHeartMedia is planned for 2025. Tayag&#x27;s wife filed her own suit in November 2024 against Robinson Helicopter Company, alleging the company knew about problems with its helicopters.

==Programming==
For many years, WBTV was one of the country&#x27;s most dominant television stations. This was in part due to being the only reliably viewable station in town for nine years, as well as the station&#x27;s long tradition of strong local news coverage. In fact, its dominance was so absolute that it was once said the dials of most Charlotteans&#x27; television sets were &quot;rusted on channel 3&quot;. To this day, WBTV has been one of CBS&#x27; strongest affiliates.

The station claims credit for a number of television &quot;firsts&quot;, among them being the construction of the first building in the United States built specifically for color television broadcasting. WBTV also claims to have been the first station in the world to record and rebroadcast programs on color videotape; to use a live camera and microwave relay inside a race car; and to have a fully computerized news operation. It claims to have been the first station in the country to develop computerized election return projections, to broadcast CBS&#x27; &quot;ExtraVision&quot; teletext service, and to produce a local newscast for a PBS member station (WTVI, channel 42). It claims to be the first station in the Southern U.S. to air color test patterns and color ID slides. WBTV was granted the first full-power construction permit for a digital television signal in the United States in 1998, which went on the air that year operating at 1 million watts–equivalent to 5 million watts for an analog transmitter.

A much-remembered women&#x27;s/homemaker&#x27;s show, &quot;The Betty Feezor Show&quot;, aired on channel 3 from the 1950s until 1977 (usually after the soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, and in its 15-minute format, &quot;Guiding Light&quot;). Feezor gave viewers tips on cooking, sewing, floral arranging, and other topics of interest to housewives and mothers. In 1965, the show was the third most-watched women&#x27;s program in the United States. The show was the first to be videotaped in color starting September 5, 1958. Feezor&#x27;s show was also carried on Richmond sister station WWBT after Jefferson-Pilot bought the station in 1968. Feezor retired in 1977 due to a brain tumor, an illness from which she died in 1978.

&quot;The Betty Feezor Show&quot; was replaced by an hour-long midday news and variety show, &quot;Top O&#x27; the Day&quot;. Segments on the program included &quot;On the Square&quot;, in which Doug Mayes solicited opinions from various Charlotte-area residents about current news topics, as well as C. J. Underwood&#x27;s &quot;Down Home with the Carolina Camera&quot;, where otherwise unknown or low-profile Carolinians were temporarily given celebrity status for their whimsical talents, novel collections, or for the way they impacted their communities. For its first five years, the show aired at noon, preempting &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. It shifted to 11:30 a.m. in 1982. To make room for &quot;Top O&#x27; the Day&quot;, WBTV aired &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; on a one-day delay at 10:30 a.m., preempting whatever game show CBS aired at that time. As a result, &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;, &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, and &quot;Now You See It&quot; never aired in Charlotte. The station did not air the CBS version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; until late in that show&#x27;s run. &quot;Top O&#x27; the Day&quot; ended in 1992, and was replaced by a conventional half-hour noon newscast. For most of the 1980s, WBTV aired the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; on a half-hour delay at 7 p.m., due to its 6 p.m. newscast lasting an hour.

For many years, WBTV occasionally preempted some of CBS&#x27; Saturday morning cartoons as well. However, area viewers could watch those preempted shows on WSPA-TV in Spartanburg or WFMY through a strong antenna (WFMY and WSPA were and still are available on some cable systems in the Charlotte market, although non-local programming is subject to blackout due to network non-duplication and syndication exclusivity rules). Before the arrival of the Carolina Panthers, WSPA was also known to air a different NFL game than what aired on WBTV, giving most Charlotte-area viewers a second option for NFL games. This was especially true if the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons played at the same time. WBTV favored the Redskins while WSPA favored the Falcons, in tandem with most CBS affiliates in their respective states.

Since the early 1990s, WBTV has generally cleared most of the CBS programming schedule in pattern, with the exception of ACC football and basketball games from Raycom Sports. For many years, WBTV aired &quot;Face the Nation&quot; on Sundays at 11:30 a.m.; most CBS affiliates in the Eastern Time Zone air it at 10:30 a.m. However, when &quot;Face the Nation&quot; was permanently expanded to an hour in 2012, WBTV moved the show to 10:30 a.m.

WBTV gained a major ratings windfall in 1981–82, when CBS won the television rights to the NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament. Due to North Carolina&#x27;s status as a college basketball hotbed and local teams North Carolina and Duke being mainstays in the tournament, NCAA tournament games are consistently among the highest-rated programs in the market during playoff season. In 2008, for instance, NCAA games on WBTV attracted a 13.4 rating and a 24 share, the third-highest in the nation (behind only WLKY-TV in Louisville and WREG-TV in Memphis).

The popularity of a series of specials commemorating the station&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 1974 led to a long-running program, &quot;Those Were the Years&quot;, hosted by Mike McKay and featuring episodes of classic television shows such as &quot;Dragnet&quot;, &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. It was seen for several years at 11:30 p.m. on Fridays, preempting the CBS late-night shows which competed poorly against &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, WBTV aired a Sunday morning program that featured singing cowboy Fred Kirby and his sidekick &quot;Uncle Jim&quot; (played by Jim Patterson). The show was known at various times as &quot;Tiny Town&quot;, &quot;Whistle Stop&quot;, &quot;Fred Kirby&#x27;s Little Rascals&quot; and &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Corral&quot;. Giving the &quot;hi-sign&quot; to his young fans, Kirby was a fixture for many years at the western-themed park Tweetsie Railroad in Blowing Rock (an hour northwest of Charlotte). In addition to Fred and Uncle Jim, viewers were treated to classic episodes of &quot;The Little Rascals&quot; (Hal Roach&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot;) as well as frequent appearances by the local bluegrass band The Br&#x27;arhoppers. Patterson was killed in a single-car accident in Charlotte in 1986; Kirby died in 1996 at age 85.

===Sports programming===
From 1982 to 2019, WBTV was the flagship station of syndicated over-the-air coverage of Atlantic Coast Conference sports. Then-owner Jefferson-Pilot took over coverage of men&#x27;s basketball from longtime producer C. D. Chesley in 1982 in partnership with Raycom, and became the sole producer of ACC football in 1984. Those rights passed to Lincoln Financial after its merger with Jefferson-Pilot in 2006. Both have been produced by Raycom Sports after their acquisition of Lincoln Financial&#x27;s sports division during the 2007–2008 season. Most ACC games that were not televised by WBTV aired on either WJZY (channel 46) or WMYT-TV (channel 55). Raycom Sports has rights to the ACC until at least the 2026–27 season. The ACC syndication package moved to cable&#x27;s ACC Network in 2019.

WBTV also airs any Panthers games carried on CBS&#x27; NFL package. The station airs at least two games a year, typically when the team plays host to an AFC opponent at Bank of America Stadium; starting in 2014, through the NFL&#x27;s new &quot;cross-flex&quot; broadcast rules, games that would normally air on Fox (locally on WJZY) can be moved arbitrarily to CBS and vice versa. WBTV also aired both of the Panthers&#x27; Super Bowl appearances locally, as CBS had the rights to Super Bowls XXXVIII and 50.

===News operation===
WBTV presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and two hours on Sundays).

For most of its first 30 years on the air, WBTV&#x27;s newscasts dominated the Nielsen ratings in the Charlotte market. In addition to its legacy as the state&#x27;s first television station, it also benefited from its ties to WBT, one of the most respected radio news operations in the Southeastern United States. Channel 3 did not face a serious challenge by any other news-producing station in the market until 1981. That year, Doug Mayes, the station&#x27;s main anchorman since it began producing daily newscasts in 1952, jumped to WSOC-TV. Mayes said years later that channel 9 offered him a deal that was too lucrative for him to resist, considering that he had kids in college. Jefferson-Pilot management, who only a few years earlier had touted Mayes as part of the station&#x27;s campaign, &quot;Turn to People You Know&quot;, wanted to make its newscasts appeal to a younger audience and made little effort to retain him. Within a few months, WBTV&#x27;s late-evening newscast lost the lead at 11 p.m. to channel 9, and it would not regain first place in that timeslot until 2004. WSOC-TV gained a large lead in ratings for most other news timeslots beginning in 1990. WBTV returned to a strong position in the late 1990s, culminating in wrestling the #1 spot at noon in 1998 from WSOC-TV. The two stations have gone back and forth at first place in most timeslots since then. During the July 2013 ratings period, WBTV took the lead at noon and 11 p.m., while WSOC led at all other news timeslots. Soon after Raycom took control of the station, WBTV began airing local newscasts and CBS programs in high definition. During the 2016 February sweeps, WBTV surged to first place in all timeslots, including the 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts, for the first time in 26 years. WBTV credited its strong social media presence and its talent continuity for the ratings win, while WSOC lost much of its main talent in the previous year. Historically, WBTV has dominated the market west of the Catawba River, a legacy from its nine-year head start. WBTV&#x27;s lead would not last, as in 2023, the station came in second in several key timeslots, behind WSOC-TV.

Diana Williams (later at WABC-TV in New York City; now retired) served as an anchor at WBTV during the early 1980s; she was succeeded as the station&#x27;s main female anchor by Sara James (now a reporter for &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;). Following the 2005 retirement of longtime WSOC anchorman Bill Walker, WBTV began billing lead anchorman Paul Cameron as &quot;The Voice of Experience&quot;. Cameron joined WBTV in 1981 as the station&#x27;s sports director, and then succeeded longtime anchor Bob Inman upon his retirement in 1996. He was only the third main anchor in the station&#x27;s history, following Mayes and Inman. Cameron served as the station&#x27;s top male anchor until his retirement on December 31, 2018.

Prior to joining in 2004, evening anchor Maureen O&#x27;Boyle, a Charlotte native and graduate of West Charlotte High School, served as anchor of the syndicated newsmagazines &quot;A Current Affair&quot; and &quot;Extra&quot;. Morning and midday anchor John Carter formerly served as a North Carolina state senator prior to joining the station. Other notable on-air personalities include Western bureau chief Steve Ohnesorge, who started as a photographer at WBTV in 1975.

In 1994, WBTV entered into a news share agreement to produce a 10 p.m. newscast for then-independent station WJZY; the newscast later moved to PBS member station WTVI, before returning to WJZY in 2003 and then to that station&#x27;s duopoly partner, MyNetworkTV affiliate WMYT-TV in April 2012. Following Fox&#x27;s purchase of WJZY and WMYT, the WBTV-produced newscast returned to WJZY when it became the market&#x27;s Fox owned-and-operated station on July 1, 2013, which continued to air until the station launched its own news department (and hour-long 10 p.m. newscast) on January 1, 2014. It placed third among local newscasts during the July 2013 ratings period, behind the WSOC-produced newscast on WAXN, and WCCB&#x27;s in-house newscast.

In September 2010, WBTV debuted an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast, which competes with what at the time was a half-hour newscast (which has since expanded to one hour) on WCNC-TV. On January 22, 2014, WBTV began producing a two-hour extension of its weekday morning newscast, airing from 7 to 9 a.m. as well as an hour-long prime time newscast at 8 p.m. for WBTV-DT2. The morning newscast ended in spring 2018, and the 8 p.m. newscast ended on August 17, 2018.

Since 2008, WBTV has partnered with its sister stations in South Carolina—WCSC, WIS in Columbia and WMBF-TV in Myrtle Beach and WHNS in Greenville—to cover stories in South Carolina. Between them, the five stations cover almost all of South Carolina. It is the second time that WBTV has had a sister station in the Florence/Myrtle Beach market; as mentioned above, Jefferson-Pilot was the founding owner of WBTW from 1954 to 1968.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:


WBTV had previously carried a standard-definition simulcast of the station&#x27;s main channel on its second digital subchannel. On July 12, 2010, the simulcast was replaced with This TV. WBTV&#x27;s weather radar was previously shown on its third subchannel, but the subchannel itself was removed prior to the digital transition. The third subchannel resumed operations upon the launch of Bounce TV on September 26, 2011. On January 1, 2012, WBTV switched the subchannels for This TV and Bounce TV, due to a contractual obligation to carry Bounce TV on the station&#x27;s second subchannel. On April 1, 2012, This TV was dropped and the third subchannel was once again removed to make room for WBTV&#x27;s mobile DTV service, but was brought back on October 8, 2014, with the Grit network. On January 1, 2020, Circle, a country music and lifestyle channel was launched and added as a fourth subchannel at 3.3, moving Grit to subchannel 3.4.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WBTV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 23, using virtual channel 3.

===NextGen TV===
WBTV upgraded to ATSC 3.0 on July 7, 2021.

==Out-of-market cable carriage==
In recent years, WBTV has been carried on cable in several areas outside of the Charlotte television market, including cable systems within the adjacent Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point and Asheville markets in North Carolina and South Carolina, and the Tri-Cities market in Tennessee and Virginia.

<text>Michael Hague (born September 8, 1948) is an American illustrator, primarily of children&#x27;s fantasy books.

==Biography==
Among the books he has illustrated classics such as &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the stories of Hans Christian Andersen. He is known for the intricate and realistic detail he brings to his work, and the rich colors he chooses.

Hague trained at the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles. He lists his influences as the comics series &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; and the works of Disney, Japanese printmakers Hiroshige and Hokusai, and turn of the 20th century illustrators Arthur Rackham, W. Heath Robinson, N. C. Wyeth and Howard Pyle. His first big break came through Trina Schart Hyman, who as an art director for Cricket Magazine, gave him several cover art assignments. 

Hague has collaborated with family members on some works. In 2008 he and his son, graphic designer Devon Hague, produced the graphic novel &quot;In the Small&quot;. He and his wife, author Kathleen Hague, have also collaborated on several books together. They currently live in Colorado Springs, where he donates time each year to making a poster for the nonprofit arts organization Imagination Celebration.

<text>Artsakh (, ) was the tenth province (&quot;nahang&quot;) of the Kingdom of Armenia from until 387 AD and afterwards made part of the Caucasian Albania, a subject principality of the Sasanian Empire, following the Peace of Acilisene. From the 7th to 9th centuries, it fell under Arab control. In 821, it formed the Armenian principality of Khachen and around the year 1000 was proclaimed the Kingdom of Artsakh, one of the last medieval eastern Armenian kingdoms and principalities to maintain its autonomy following the Turkic invasions of the 11th to 14th centuries. 

==Name==
Cuneiform inscriptions left by Urartian kings mention a land or lands called &quot;Ardakh&quot;/&quot;Adakh&quot;, &quot;Urdekhe&quot;/&quot;Urtekhini&quot;, and &quot;Atakhuni&quot;, which some scholars identify with Artsakh. When speaking about Armenia in his &quot;Geography&quot;, the classical historian Strabo refers to an Armenian region which he calls &quot;Orchistene&quot;, which is also believed to be a rendering of the name Artsakh. Some early Armenian sources spell the name as &quot;Ardzakh&quot; (). 

Many different proposed etymologies and interpretations of the name Artsakh exist. The 19th-century Armenian scholar Ghevont Alishan writes of the name&#x27;s origin that it &quot;remains unknown, but perhaps it would not be out of place to think that it comes from the name of bushes and trees &quot;tsakh&quot;, in accordance with the land&#x27;s forested character&quot;. David M. Lang connects Artsakh with the name of King Artaxias I of Armenia (190–159 BC), founder of the Artaxiad dynasty that ruled Greater Armenia. Another scholar proposed that Artsakh consists of the elements &quot;art&quot; (&quot;field&quot; in Armenian) and &quot;aght&quot; (a Classical Armenian word for &quot;black&quot;). 

Based on the putative attestations of Artsakh as Urtekhe and Orchistene, historian Babken Harutyunyan hypothesizes that the initial vowel in Artsakh was originally an &quot;o&quot; sound (the vowel sounds &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; are not distinguished in cuneiform) that later underwent a vowel shift to an &quot;a&quot; sound, which is typical of Indo-European languages. On the basis of this assumption, linguist Lusine Margaryan proposes a connection with the Armenian word ( in modern pronunciation, in the plural accusative case), meaning &#x27;grapevine&#x27;, and the Hurro-Urartian suffix / (indicating placenames). According to this hypothesis, the name Artsakh developed from the unattested form * and can be interpreted as meaning &quot;place of grapevines, grape garden&quot;․ Another hypothesis derives the first part of the name from the root /, meaning &#x27;rocky, mountainous&#x27;.

In the Middle Ages, Artsakh was occasionally referred to as &quot;Little Syunik&quot; or &quot;Second Syunik&quot; after the neighboring province. Medieval Armenian authors also referred to it as or, together with neighboring Utik, (&quot;East&quot; in Armenian), (&quot;the eastern regions&quot;), (&quot;the Caucasian Albanian regions&quot;) or simply (&quot;Caucasian Albania&quot;). The name Artsakh was repopularized among Armenians in the modern era, particularly with the emergence of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Artsakh is used by Armenians as a synonym for Karabagh and was used in the official name of the unrecognized Republic of Artsakh (also known as the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic). 

==Geography==

Artsakh was located on the easternmost edge of the Armenian Plateau (the eastern part of the Lesser Caucasus) and was mostly mountainous and forested. Its area is estimated to have been 11,528 km2. It was bordered by the following Armenian provinces: Utik to the east, Gardman to the northeast, and Syunik to the southwest. The river Arax formed its southern boundary, while the Hakari/Aghavno River was its only clear boundary with Syunik. To its east and southeast laid the lowlands between the Kura and Arax rivers and the Mughan plain, which at one point formed the Paytakaran province of Armenia. Artsakh&#x27;s two largest rivers were the Gargar and the Tartar (Trtu in Classical Armenian sources), which flow eastward and eventually join the Kura. The medieval Kingdom of Artsakh (1000–1261) encompassed the entire territory of the classical province and also included Gardman-Parisos to the north and the cantons of Sodk and Gegharkunik of Syunik, located on the shores of Lake Sevan.

Important places in Artsakh (mostly fortified towns) included Parisos, Tigranakert, Sodk, Tsar, Vaykunik, Asteghblur, Goroz and Berdaglukh. The city of Tigranakert, which was first excavated in 2005, is believed to have been founded by King Tigranes the Great of Armenia in the 1st century BC, although conceivably it could also have been founded by King Tigranes I (123–55 BC). Later, in the Caucasian Albanian period, the village of Gyutakan (Armenian: Գյուտական, known as the &quot;Royal Village&quot;) became of great importance as the residence of Vachagan III the Pious (467–510 AD), the last King of Caucasian Albania. During early medieval times, the castle of Khachen served for a considerable time as the center of Artsakh.

==Cantons==
According to the anonymous 7th-century Armenian work &quot;Ashkharatsoyts&quot; (&quot;Geography&quot;) Artsakh comprised 12 cantons (&quot;gavars&quot;, variations on spelling exist):

* Myus Haband
* Vaykunik
* Berdadzor
* Mets Arank
* Mets Kvenk
* Harchlank
* Mukhank
* Piank
* Parzkank
* Sisakan Vostan or Sisakan-i-Kotak
* Kust-i-Parnes
* Koght

The precise location of many of these cantons is not known for certain, and not all of these names are used by later Armenian authors. Some versions enumerate 13 or 14 cantons.

==Status==
It is not certain how Artsakh was administered as a sub-national political entity within Armenia. Ghevont Alishan believed that Artsakh was originally a part of Syunik that was later separated and regarded as its own province. According to some Armenian scholars, Artsakh formed a principality with the adjacent canton of Sodk. Conceivably it was royal land. Its northern part also comprised the principality of Koght and it is possible that the princes of Koght were the original owners of Artsakh. Under the rule of Caucasian Albania, Artsakh, while often referred to, was not a recognized political entity. By the 9th century it comprised a number of small political units ruled by the Aranshahiks, including the principalities of Khachen in the center and Dizak in the south. Only in the 13th century did these two states merge into one – the Kingdom of Artsakh. 

==Population==
Anthropological studies show that the current Artsakh (Karabakh) Armenians are the direct physical descendants of the indigenous population of the region. Following the modern consensus among western scholars concerning the origin of the Armenian people, they represent a fusion of the mostly Indo-European natives of the Armenian Plateau (including Artsakh), and the Hurrians of the southernmost Armenian Plateau. According to this theory, from earliest times the Armenian Plateau was inhabited by many ethnic groups. The ethnic character of Artsakh may thus have been originally more diverse than it is now. It is worth noting that Strabo described Armenia (which then included also Artsakh and Utik) in the 1st century BC as &quot;monolingual&quot;, though this does not necessarily mean that its population consisted exclusively of ethnic Armenians.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, the proto-Armenians had settled as far north as the Kura River by the 7th century BC. In Robert Hewsen&#x27;s view, until the 6th–5th centuries BC the proto-Armenians lived only in the western half of the Armenian Plateau (in areas between Cappadocia, the Tigris, the Euphrates, and Lake Van) and came to Artsakh and adjacent regions such as Syunik and Utik somewhat later than the central parts of the Armenian Plateau (as late as the 2nd century BC, as a result of Artaxias I&#x27;s conquests). While genetical studies claimed and proved that Artsakh also was part of the original proto-Armenian homeland, and that Armenians are the direct descendants of the peoples living in the region 7800 years ago. The conclusion from the studies is that also before the bronze age the population was at the very least mostly Armenian. Although little is known of the other people (except the Armenians) that lived in Artsakh and Utik prior to the putative 2nd-century BC where the region was part of Artaxiad Armenia, Hewsen argues that some names of those tribes (mentioned by Greek, Roman and Armenian authors) demonstrate that some of them were not Armenian, nor Indo-European, and that they assimilated into the Armenians over time.

By medieval times, from at least the 9th century, the population of Artsakh had a strong Armenian national identity. Its people spoke a local Eastern Armenian dialect, the &quot;Artsakhian dialect&quot; (today known as the Karabakh dialect), which was mentioned by 7th-century grammarian Stepanos Syunetsi in his earliest record of the Armenian dialects․

==History==

===Traditional views===
The early Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi tells of a certain Aran, a descendant of the legendary Armenian patriarch Hayk through Sisak, who inherited &quot;the plain of Albania [&quot;Aghuankʻ&quot;] and the mountainous region of the same plain&quot; from the Arax River up to the fortress of Hnarakert (located on the Kura), and was appointed governor (&quot;koghmnakal&quot;) by King Vagharsak the Parthian. Khorenatsi writes that Aran&#x27;s descendants formed the ruling families of the lands of Utik, Gardman, Tsawdēkʻ and Gargar, and that &quot;Aghuankʻ&quot; (the Armenian name for Caucasian Albania/Arran) was named so after Aran, since he was called &quot;aghu&quot; (meaning &quot;soft, tender, amiable&quot; in Armenian) on account of his good manners. This story is repeated by later medieval Armenian historians, including Stephen Orbelian and Movses Kaghankatvatsi. The latter author identifies Aran as the founder of the original ruling dynasty of Caucasian Albania, the Aranshahiks. Armenian historians such as Bagrat Ulubabyan and Asatur Mnatsakanyan interpret Khorenatsi&#x27;s story about Aran and his descendants as an allegorical reflection of the historical Armenianness of the lands between the Kura and Arax rivers, i.e. Utik and Artsakh.

===Early history===
In 1968, Soviet archaeologists discovered a fragment of a jawbone of a pre-Homo sapiens human dating back possibly to the Middle Acheulean culture in a cave complex near the village of Azokh in modern-day Nagorno-Karabakh. Other sites of archaeological interest are located in the vicinity of Stepanakert, Khojaly, and Astghashen, where ancient burial mounds containing human and animal remains, tools, pottery and other objects have been discovered. In general, archaeological remains in Artsakh reflect the competing influences from around 800 BC of the neighboring rival states of Urartu, Assyria, and Mannai. If Artsakh is to be identified with the Adakh/Urtekhini/Atakhuni of Urartian cuneiform inscriptions, then it was the target of military campaigns by two Urartian kings: Sarduri II and Rusa I.

===Classical Era===
After the fall of Urartu (6th century BC), most of the region south of the Kura River came under the domination of the Medes, followed by the Achaemenian Persians until 331 BC when Alexander the Great invaded the region during his wars with the Achaemenids, upsetting its balance of power. In Robert H. Hewsen&#x27;s view, Artsakh and neighboring Utik became a part of the Kingdom of Armenia only after 189 BC, when the Artaxiad dynasty came to power in Armenia. Strabo reports that King Artaxias I of Armenia () expanded his state in all directions at the expense of his neighbors, conquering the lands of Caspiane (previously ruled by the Medes) and &quot;Phaunitis&quot; (supposedly a copyist error for Saunities, i.e. Syunik), as well as, presumably, the lands lying in between Syunik and the Caspian Sea, i.e. Artsakh and Utik. Many Armenian historians reject this view, arguing that Artsakh and Utik were ruled and populated by Armenians from the earliest days of the formation of the Armenian people. It is possible that Artsakh had earlier been part of Orontid Armenia in the 4th–2nd centuries BC rather than under Median rule.

Strabo mentions that the land of Orchistene, frequently identified with Artsakh, &quot;furnishes the most cavalry&quot; of the Armenian provinces. In the Classical Armenian sources, Artsakh is described as a strategic and fortified region. In the words of the historian Leo, judging from the Classical Armenian sources, Artsakh, along with Syunik, Utik, Sasun and other remote regions of Greater Armenia, was regarded as a &quot;wild&quot; or &quot;barbarous&quot; province when compared with the center of the kingdom, Ayrarat. 

In 301, Armenia was converted to Christianity under the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia. The Armenian historian Agathangelos mentioned the princes of Utik and Sodk (which probably comprised Artsakh) among the sixteen Armenian princes who escorted Gregory the Illuminator to Caesarea, where he would be enthroned the Patriach of Armenia.

Artsakh became a major stronghold for Armenian missionaries to proclaim the Christian Gospel to neighboring countries. In 310 St Grigoris, the grandson of Grigor the Illuminator, was ordained bishop of Iberia and Caucasian Albania in the monastery of Amaras, being just 15 years old at the time. After his martyrdom by the Mazkutian king on the field of Vatnean (near Derbent), his disciples conveyed his body back to Artsakh and buried him in Amaras, which had been built by Gregory the Illuminator and Grigoris himself. Hence St Grigoris became a patron saint of Artsakh. The historian Pavstos Buzand wrote that &quot;... every year the people of that places and cantons gathers there [in Amaras] for the festive commemoration of his valor&quot;.

In the 5th century, Christian culture flourished in Artsakh. Around 410 Mesrop Mashtots opened the first Armenian school at Amaras. Later, more schools were opened in Artsakh.

==== Armeno-Persian wars ====
The second half of the 4th century saw a series of wars between the Kingdom of Armenia and Sassanid Persia. After enduring 34 years of warfare, the Armenian nobility of Artsakh and most other provinces of Armenia revolted, refusing to support the Armenian king Arshak II anymore out of war-weariness. According to Pavstos Buzand, after bringing Arshak&#x27;s son Pap to the Armenian throne and defeating the Sassanid invaders with Roman assistance, the Armenian &quot;sparapet&quot; (supreme commander) Mushegh Mamikonian severely punished the rebelling Armenian provinces, Artsakh included, and brought them back under the control of the Armenian monarchy. Then, in 372 he attacked the Caucasian Albanians and took back from them the neighboring province of Utik, in the process reestablishing the Kura River as the boundary between Armenia and Caucasian Albania.

In 387, according to the terms of the Peace of Acilisene, the Armenian kingdom was partitioned between the Roman and Sasanian empires. Caucasian Albania, as an ally of the Sassanids at the time, gained Armenian territories the right bank of the river Kura up to the Arax, including Artsakh, Gardman and Utik.

Following the Battle of Avarayr (451), in which a united Christian army consisting of Armenians, Georgians, and Caucasian Albanians clashed with the Sassanid army, many of the Armenian nobles retreated to impassable mountains and forests in several provinces, including Artsakh, which became a center for resistance against Sassanid Iran. From the 5th to the 7th centuries Artsakh was ruled by the Armenian noble family of Arranshahiks. Furthermore, the Armenian rulers of Artsakh began to play a considerable role in the affairs of Caucasian Albania. In 498 in the settlement named Aghuen (in present-day Mardakert region of Nagorno-Karabakh), an Albanian church assembly was held, in the presence of the nobility and princes (&quot;azgapetk&quot;) of Artsakh and the king Vachagan the Pious, to adopt the &quot;Constitution of Aghven&quot;, which would arrange relations between the nobility (landlords), clergy and village people.

===Medieval Period===

In the 7th–9th centuries, the South Caucasus was dominated by the Arab Caliphates. In the early 9th century two Armenian princes, Sahl Smbatian and Esayi Abu-Muse, revolted against Arab rule and established two independent principalities in Artsakh: Khachen and Dizak. At the time the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII addressed letters &quot;to prince of Khachen – to Armenia&quot;, being the residence of the Armenian prince Sahl Smbatian. In 852–855 Sahl Smbatian and Esayi Abu-Muse fought against the Abbasid commander Bugha. The latter 28 times unsuccessfully attempted to conquer Ktich Castle (situated near modern-day Togh in Nagorno-Karabakh), the main stronghold of the Armenians of Artsakh. The descendants of Sahl Smbatian through his son Atrnerseh consolidated their rule over Artsakh over the years; Artsakh was politically unified for three-and-a-half centuries until Hasan the Great partitioned it between two of his sons in 1182. From c. 1000 to 1266 the rulers of Khachen styled themselves &quot;Kings of Albania&quot; or &quot;Kings of Artsakh&quot;, but they stopped using the royal title after the death of Hasan Jalal Dawla in the 1260s. The principality eventually split into smaller parts known as the Khamsa Melikdoms of Karabakh, ruled by branches of the House of Hasan-Jalalyan. Subsequently, Artsakh existed as a vassal of the Kara Koyunlu, Ak Koyunlu, Iranian Safavids, Zands, Afsharids, and Qajars, until it was ceded to Imperial Russia following the outcome of the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) and the following Treaty of Gulistan.

<text>CIVI-DT (channel 53) is a television station in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, part of the CTV 2 system. It is owned and operated by Bell Media alongside Vancouver-based CTV station CIVT-DT (channel 32). Although the two stations nominally maintain separate operations, the Victoria station&#x27;s newscasts have been produced from the CIVT-DT studios since 2023. CIVI-DT&#x27;s offices are located at the corner of Broad Street and Pandora Avenue across from the McPherson Playhouse and the Victoria City Hall in downtown Victoria, and its transmitter is located on the roof of Camosack Manor near Rockland. The station operates a rebroadcaster (CIVI-DT-2) on virtual and UHF channel 17 in Vancouver, with transmitter atop Mount Seymour in the district municipality of North Vancouver.

==History==
At the end of the 1990s, CHUM Limited only owned terrestrial television stations in the province of Ontario. Similarly, Craig Media only had stations in provinces within the Canadian Prairies. Both companies looked to expand their national presence, and both submitted a bid when the CRTC issued a call for applications for a new television station licence in Victoria; CHUM was awarded the licence in 2000. CIVI first signed on the air on October 4, 2001, as CHUM&#x27;s first original station to be part of the NewNet television system. Their studios, dubbed &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; for its location on Pandora Avenue, had previously been the home of the Brackman-Ker Milling Company and other uses over the years; CHUM spent over $20 million restoring it, including outfitting the building with the latest in technology and bringing it up to seismic standards.
Known on the air as &quot;The New VI&quot;, the station started off with much pomp and circumstance, marking their launch with a street party around their studios in Victoria and around their Nanaimo bureau. It boasted a large lineup of personalities, including former British Columbia New Democratic Party cabinet minister Moe Sihota. Original programming included &quot;Island Underground&quot; (focusing on Vancouver Island&#x27;s youth culture), &quot;The New Canoe&quot; (hosted by and produced for the area&#x27;s First Nations residents), &quot;Environ-Mental&quot; (focusing on localized environmental issues), the &quot;VI Parade&quot; (handling local arts and culture), and a localized version of &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Corner&quot;; much of the launch schedule consisted of programming from other CHUM outlets (including &quot;CityLine&quot;, &quot;FashionTelevision&quot; and &quot;Ed the Sock&#x27;s Night Party&quot;), some of which had previously aired across the border on KVOS-TV in Bellingham, Washington (which CHUM had been syndicating programming to since the 1990s in the face of repeated failures to launch a station in the area), along with American imported and syndicated programming (including &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise), and a prime time movie on Sundays dubbed &quot;The Great MoVI&quot; (in the style of Citytv&#x27;s &quot;Great Movies&quot;).

However, the station wound up launching amid a massive TV realignment in the Vancouver market, and ultimately their launch was delayed from September to October; the various changes also meant that KVOS was displaced by CIVI from its long-time home on channel 12 on many Vancouver-area cable systems. The station also struggled to compete against CH owned-and-operated station CHEK-TV (channel 6, now an independent station), which had been the only local station on Vancouver Island for more than four decades. Gradually, personalities from the original roster were replaced by new faces, and some were let go without replacements. Not long after launch, CHUM purchased CKVU in Vancouver and converted it into the Citytv station for the region, meaning CIVI became part of a twinstick; as per CRTC regulations regarding twinsticks, CKVU was prohibited from airing more than 10% of the programming aired on CIVI, and newscasts were required to be separately managed.

===As A-Channel Victoria===
The station was rebranded as &quot;A-Channel&quot; on August 2, 2005, along with the rest of the NewNet system. The station would likely have been part of the original A-Channel system at its launch had Craig Media won the licence in 2000. On July 12, 2006, CTVglobemedia announced plans to purchase CHUM Limited, with the intention of divesting the A-Channel stations. On that same day it was also announced that the morning news program &quot;A-Channel Morning&quot; would be discontinued, although this decision was supposedly unrelated to the takeover by CTVglobemedia (CIVI later restored a morning program to its schedule in the fall of 2007).

Rogers Communications announced a deal to buy A-Channel on April 9, 2007; however, given the conditions of approval for the sale of CHUM on June 8, 2007, Rogers acquired the Citytv system instead, while CTV kept A-Channel. CTVglobemedia became the official owner of CIVI on June 22, 2007.

===As A Vancouver Island===

The A-Channel system and Atlantic Canada&#x27;s ASN was rebranded as A on August 11, 2008, with CIVI becoming branded as &quot;A Vancouver Island&quot;. As a result, CIVI&#x27;s newscasts were rebranded as &quot;A News&quot; on that date, although the station&#x27;s employees had been using that title for a couple of months prior to the relaunch; the station also began producing a morning newscast (under the title &quot;A Morning&quot;) on September 8, 2008, but was later cancelled on March 4, 2009, due to economic issues. The program was later replaced with a simulcast of the morning show from sister radio station CFAX (1070 AM).

===CTV Two/CTV 2 Vancouver Island===
As part of Bell Media&#x27;s May 30, 2011, announcement of the rebranding of the A television stations to the CTV Two brand, CIVI became branded as &quot;CTV Two Vancouver Island&quot; on August 29, 2011. As a result, CIVI&#x27;s newscasts were rebranded as &quot;CTV News&quot; on that same date.

==News operation==

CIVI presently broadcasts two hours and 30 minutes of original newscasts each week, consisting of a thirty-minute local newscast each weekday at 4:30 p.m., anchored remotely from the Vancouver studios of co-owned CIVT. This newscast is repeated, potentially with minor modifications, at 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. (the latter being a 35-minute timeslot). There are no longer any weekend newscasts.

At launch, the station&#x27;s newscast was dubbed &quot;VILand News&quot; (sister station CKVR had originally used a similar title, &quot;VRLand News&quot;, for their first few years as a NewNet station); the station&#x27;s news anchors walked around the studio instead of sitting behind a desk, mimicking the format used at Toronto sister station CITY-TV and other NewNet outlets. &quot;VILand News&quot; consisted of a 90-minute long evening newscast from 5:30 to 7:00 p.m. and a half-hour late newscast at 11:00 p.m., as well as the two-hour morning newscast &quot;New Day&quot; (initially broadcast from the station&#x27;s Nanaimo facilities with Bruce Williams). Weatherman and local folk musician Tony Latimer delivered his forecasts from his own sailboat, the &quot;Forbes and Cameron&quot;, which was equipped with an omni-directional microwave transmitter so Tony could broadcast from Victoria&#x27;s Inner Harbour or other offshore locations.

To combat the station&#x27;s low ratings, the evening news block was also repeatedly modified, being split into three different shows (&quot;VILand Live&quot; at 5:30, &quot;VILand Voices&quot; at 6:00 and &quot;VILand News&quot; at 6:30) in January 2002. By 2004, CHUM higher-ups, in hopes of stemming the station&#x27;s financial losses and low ratings, hired longtime CHEK anchor Hudson Mack as its new chief anchor and news director. Changes were introduced to the station&#x27;s newscasts such as the introduction of a desk for the anchors; these changes appeared to have been effective. While still trailing CHEK, the ratings gap between the two had narrowed.

Since Mack&#x27;s arrival, the station has been honoured with a number of industry awards. In 2006, it received three Edward R. Murrow Awards from the Radio-Television News Directors Association International, for Best Newscast, Best Investigative Reporting and Best Sports Reporting. It was the second straight year the station won Murrows for its newscast and investigative reporting. In 2005, the station won eight industry awards, including two Edward R. Murrow Awards from RTNDA International, for Best Newscast and Best Investigative Reporting; and top news honours from the British Columbia Association of Broadcasters.

The station&#x27;s weekend 6:00 p.m. newscasts were cancelled as of February 3, 2021, due to budget cuts made by Bell Media.

On June 15, 2023, in the wake of cuts announced by Bell Media earlier that week, the station announced it had replaced its early-evening newscasts with a single half-hour 4:30 p.m. newscast (repeated at 6:00 p.m.) on weekdays, anchored from Vancouver, effective June 19. The &quot;Times Colonist&quot; reported that this was the station&#x27;s only remaining daily newscast.

====Analogue-to-digital conversion====

CIVI shut down its analogue signal, over UHF channel 53, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 23, using virtual channel 53.

<text>Baudilio José Díaz Seijas (March 23, 1953 – November 23, 1990) was a Venezuelan professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher from 1977 to 1989, most prominently with the Cleveland Indians where he rose to prominence as an American League (AL) All-Star player in 1981 and, later with the Philadelphia Phillies where he was a member of the 1983 National League pennant winning team. He earned his second All-Star game berth with the Cincinnati Reds in 1987. Diaz began his career with the Boston Red Sox. He was the first Venezuelan to play regularly as a catcher in Major League Baseball. In 2006, Díaz was posthumously inducted into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Baseball career==

===Minor Leagues and Boston Red Sox===
Díaz was born in Cúa, Miranda, Venezuela. At the age of 14, he played on a national champion Little League team that missed a trip to the 1967 Little League World Series, when a strong earthquake devastated the city of Caracas.

In December 1970, Díaz was signed by Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent. He spent seven seasons playing in the Red Sox minor league system. While playing for the Pawtucket Red Sox in 1977, he posted a .263 batting average, with 14 doubles, 7 home runs, and 54 runs batted in (RBI). This earned Díaz his big league call-up on September 6, 1977, versus the Blue Jays, at Toronto. He entered the game as a late-inning defensive replacement for Hall of Famer Carlton Fisk. Díaz appeared in only two games for the Red Sox, being struck out by Dennis Martínez in his only at-bat, which occurred that September 17.

===Cleveland Indians===
On March 30, 1978, Díaz was traded along with Ted Cox, Mike Paxton and Rick Wise to the Cleveland Indians for Dennis Eckersley and Fred Kendall. He played as the Indians&#x27; backup catcher, working behind Gary Alexander in 1978. He lost his job to Ron Hassey the following season, and played most of the year in the minor leagues with the Tacoma Tugs in the Pacific Coast League, before returning to play for the Indians in September 1979. In 1980, he hit for a .227 average in 76 games but, provided solid defense, committing only 4 errors in 356 total chances, while serving as backup catcher behind Hassey.

After Hassey was injured early in the strike-shortened 1981 season, Cleveland manager Dave Garcia began using Díaz in a platoon role alongside the left-hand hitting Hassey. By June, he was hitting for a .356 batting average with 4 home runs and 25 runs batted in to earn a place as a reserve player for the American League team in the 1981 All-Star Game. He ended the season with a .313 batting average in 63 games.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
In November 1981, Díaz was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies as part of a three-team trade. He became the Phillies starting catcher in 1982, replacing Bob Boone, who had been traded to the California Angels. Díaz set career highs in batting average (.288), home runs (18), and runs batted in (85). Although Díaz led National League catchers in stolen bases allowed, his pitch-calling skills helped pitcher Steve Carlton become the league&#x27;s only twenty-game winner of the season. Carlton also led the league in strikeouts and shutouts and, was named the 1982 National League Cy Young Award winner. In a 1982 computer ranking of major league players that used offensive and defensive statistics, Díaz was ranked second among National League catchers behind only Gary Carter.

Díaz was a member of the 1983 Phillies team that became known as &quot;The Wheeze Kids&quot;, due to the average age of the team being over thirty. The moniker was a whimsical reference to the Whiz Kids Phillies team that won the National League pennant in 1950. In a game against the New York Mets on April 13, 1983, Díaz performed a feat that has only been accomplished by 11 other players in the history of Major League Baseball. The Phillies were trailing by a score of 9–6 and with two outs in the ninth inning, when Díaz hit a grand slam home run off Neil Allen to win the game for the Phillies by a score of 10–9. On September 23, Díaz was the Phillies catcher when Steve Carlton won the 300th game of his career. With the Phillies leading the game by a score of 3–2 in the fifth inning, Díaz sealed the victory with a two-run single.

The Phillies won 12 out of the final 14 games of the 1983 season to win the National League Eastern Division title. Díaz contributed by hitting .360 in the final week of the season, including a game on September 28 against the Chicago Cubs in which he had 5 hits in 5 at-bats including 2 home runs. Although he led National League catchers in errors, he led the league in range factor and finished second in putouts, assists and in baserunners caught stealing. After defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1983 National League Championship Series, the Phillies lost the 1983 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles in five games. In the only World Series appearance of his career, Díaz was the leading hitter for the Phillies with a .333 batting average. During Game One of the Series (the only game of the Series that the Phillies won, by a 2–1 score), Díaz almost hit a home-run, but he was robbed of it by John Lowenstein with a spectacular, beyond the wall catch.

In 1984, Díaz went on the disabled list twice due to knee problems and played in only 27 games. After the season ended, he underwent two knee surgeries to restore his mobility. Díaz broke his right wrist at the beginning of the 1985 season and was on the disabled list for a month and a half. During his absence, his replacement, Ozzie Virgil hit above the .300 mark, relegating Díaz to the backup catcher&#x27;s role upon his return. On August 8, 1985, the Phillies traded Díaz to the Cincinnati Reds.

===Cincinnati Reds===
Díaz immediately became the Reds&#x27; starting catcher. He had been hitting for a .211 average at the time of the trade but, hit .261 in 51 games for the Reds, ending the 1985 season with a .245 average overall along with 5 home runs and 31 runs batted in. Díaz remained healthy in 1986, appearing in 134 games and posted a .272 average with 10 home runs and 56 runs batted in. Although he committed 13 errors, he finished fourth among catchers in assists with 80 and, fourth in baserunners caught stealing with 55.

On June 27, 1986, Díaz was part of an unusual occurrence when San Francisco Giants second baseman, Robby Thompson, became the first player in major league history to be caught stealing four times in one game. Thompson was thrown out at second base by Díaz in the 4th, 6th and 9th innings and was picked off by pitcher John Franco in the 11th inning. Three of the outs occurred during attempted hit and run plays and were recorded as stolen base attempts.

In 1987, Díaz was hitting for a .292 average at mid-season, earning his second All-Star selection as a reserve player, this time for the National League team in the 1987 All-Star Game. He was named Player of the Month for the month of July during which he produced a .351 batting average with 5 home runs and 23 runs batted in, including a game on July 7 when he had 6 runs batted in. His heavy workload continued as he played in 140 games, ending the season with a respectable .270 average with 15 home runs and 82 runs batted in. Díaz also led National League catchers in baserunners caught stealing and finished third in fielding percentage, committing only 7 errors in 137 games played as a catcher.

Reds&#x27; manager Pete Rose continued to play Díaz almost every day in the 1988 season. Díaz was the Reds catcher on June 6, 1988, when pitcher Tom Browning almost threw a no-hitter against the San Diego Padres. Browning held the Padres hitless through eight innings before Tony Gwynn hit a single with one out in the ninth inning (however, Browning would go on to throw a perfect game two months later on September 16 against the Dodgers). Eventually, the heavy workload began to catch up with Díaz. In mid-June, a shoulder injury put him on the disabled list and then in September, Díaz had to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, which ended his season. He shared catching duties with Jeff Reed in 1989 but, in July Díaz had to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left knee for a second time, which ended his season. Díaz decided to retire, having played in his final major league game on July 9, 1989, at the age of 36.

==Career statistics==
In a 13-year major league career, Díaz played in 993 games, accumulating 834 hits in 3,274 at bats for a .255 career batting average along with 87 home runs, 452 runs batted in and a .297 on-base percentage. A two-time All-Star, he finished his career with a .986 fielding percentage.

==Leones del Caracas==
Díaz played exclusively for the Leones del Caracas team in the Venezuelan Winter League (1972–1990), forming a fiery offensive combo along with slugger Tony Armas. During his time in the league, Díaz batted .281, with 265 runs scored, 290 runs batted in, 79 doubles, 7 triples, and 57 home runs, in 537 games played. In 1979, he set a Venezuelan League single-season record for home runs with 20, a record that was broken by Alex Cabrera, who hit 21 in 2013–2014 season. Díaz was the leading hitter in the 1982 Caribbean Series with a .412 batting average and 2 home runs, earning him the Series’ Most Valuable Player award.

Díaz was part of an extremely unlikely event spanning thirteen years. On January 6, 1973, he caught for minor league pitcher Urbano Lugo, who threw a no-hitter as the Leones del Caracas defeated the Tiburones de La Guaira, 6–0. Thirteen years later, on January 24, 1986, Díaz was the catcher for another no-hitter in a 4–0 Caracas&#x27;s victory over La Guaira. This time, the pitcher was major leaguer Urbano Lugo Jr., son of the elder Lugo.

==Death==
On November 23, 1990, Díaz was killed, aged 37, when a satellite dish he was trying to install on the roof of his Caracas home fell on him and crushed his neck and head. Díaz was survived by his wife, Maria, and their two sons.

<doc id="560252" wikidata="Q2635158" url="?curid=560252" title="Progressive Era">
<text>The Progressive Era (1890s–1920s) was a period in the United States characterized by multiple social and political reform efforts. Reformers during this era, known as Progressives, sought to address issues they associated with rapid industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and political corruption, as well as the concentration of industrial ownership in monopolies. Reformers expressed concern about slums, poverty, and labor conditions. Multiple overlapping movements pursued social, political, and economic reforms by advocating changes in governance, scientific methods, and professionalism; regulating business; protecting the natural environment; and seeking to improve urban living and working conditions.

Corrupt and undemocratic political machines and their bosses were a major target of progressive reformers. To revitalize democracy, progressives established direct primary elections, direct election of senators (rather than by state legislatures), initiatives and referendums, and women&#x27;s suffrage which was promoted to advance democracy and bring the presumed moral influence of women into politics. For many progressives, prohibition of alcoholic beverages was key to eliminating corruption in politics as well as improving social conditions.

Another target were monopolies, which progressives worked to regulate through trustbusting and antitrust laws with the goal of promoting fair competition. Progressives also advocated new government agencies focused on regulation of industry.

An additional goal of progressives was bringing to bear scientific, medical, and engineering solutions to reform government and education and foster improvements in various fields including medicine, finance, insurance, industry, railroads, and churches. They aimed to professionalize the social sciences, especially history, economics, and political science and improve efficiency with scientific management or Taylorism.

Initially, the movement operated chiefly at the local level, but later it expanded to the state and national levels. Progressive leaders were often from the educated middle class, and various progressive reform efforts drew support from lawyers, teachers, physicians, ministers, business people, and the working class.

==Originators of progressive ideals and efforts==
Certain key groups of thinkers, writers, and activists played key roles in creating or building the movements and ideas that came to define the shape of the Progressive Era.

===Popular democracy: Initiative and referendum===
Inspiration for the initiative movement was based on the Swiss experience. New Jersey labor activist James W. Sullivan visited Switzerland in 1888 and wrote a detailed book that became a template for reformers pushing the idea: &quot;Direct Legislation by the Citizenship Through the Initiative and Referendum&quot; (1893). He suggested that using the initiative would give political power to the working class and reduce the need for strikes. Sullivan&#x27;s book was first widely read on the left, as by labor activists, socialists and populists. William U&#x27;Ren was an early convert who used it to build the Oregon reform crusade. By 1900, middle-class &quot;progressive&quot; reformers everywhere were studying it.

===Muckraking: exposing corruption===

Magazines experienced a boost in popularity in 1900, with some attaining circulations in the hundreds of thousands of subscribers. In the beginning of the age of mass media, the rapid expansion of national advertising led the cover price of popular magazines to fall sharply to about 10 cents, lessening the financial barrier to consume them. Another factor contributing to the dramatic upswing in magazine circulation was the prominent coverage of corruption in politics, local government, and big business, particularly by journalists and writers who became known as muckrakers&quot;.&quot; They wrote for popular magazines to expose social and political sins and shortcomings. Relying on their own investigative journalism, muckrakers often worked to expose social ills and corporate and political corruption. Muckraking magazines, notably &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, took on corporate monopolies and political machines while raising public awareness of chronic urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, and social issues like child labor. Most of the muckrakers wrote nonfiction, but fictional exposés often had a major impact as well, such as those by Upton Sinclair. In his 1906 novel &quot;The Jungle&quot;, Sinclair exposed the unsanitary and unsafe working conditions of the meatpacking industry in graphic detail hoping to arouse working class solidarity. He quipped, &quot;I aimed at the public&#x27;s heart and by accident, I hit it in the stomach,&quot; as readers demanded and got the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act.

The journalists who specialized in exposing waste, corruption, and scandal operated at the state and local level, like Ray Stannard Baker, George Creel, and Brand Whitlock. Others such as Lincoln Steffens exposed political corruption in many large cities; Ida Tarbell is famed for her criticisms of John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil Company. In 1906, David Graham Phillips unleashed a blistering indictment of corruption in the US Senate. Roosevelt gave these journalists their nickname when he complained they were not being helpful by raking up too much muck.

===Modernization===
The progressives were avid modernizers, with a belief in science and technology as the grand solution to society&#x27;s flaws. They looked to education as the key to bridging the gap between their present wasteful society and technologically enlightened future society. Characteristics of progressivism included a favorable attitude toward urban–industrial society, belief in mankind&#x27;s ability to improve the environment and conditions of life, belief in an obligation to intervene in economic and social affairs, a belief in the ability of experts and in the efficiency of government intervention. Scientific management, as promulgated by Frederick Winslow Taylor, became a watchword for industrial efficiency and elimination of waste, with the stopwatch as its symbol.

===Philanthropy===
The number of rich families climbed exponentially, from 100 or so millionaires in the 1870s to 4,000 in 1892 and 16,000 in 1916. Many subscribed to Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s credo outlined in &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot; that said they owed a duty to society that called for philanthropic giving to colleges, hospitals, medical research, libraries, museums, religion, and social betterment.

In the early 20th century, American philanthropy matured, with the development of very large, highly visible private foundations created by Rockefeller and Carnegie. The largest foundations fostered modern, efficient, business-oriented operations (as opposed to &quot;charity&quot;) designed to better society rather than merely enhance the status of the giver. Close ties were built with the local business community, as in the &quot;community chest&quot; movement. The American Red Cross was reorganized and professionalized. Several major foundations aided the blacks in the South and were typically advised by Booker T. Washington. By contrast, Europe and Asia had few foundations. This allowed both Carnegie and Rockefeller to operate internationally with a powerful effect.

===Middle-class values===
A hallmark group of the Progressive Era, the middle class became the driving force behind much of the thought and reform that took place in this time. The middle class was characterized by their rejection of the individualistic philosophy of the Upper ten thousand. They had a rapidly growing interest in the communication and role between classes, those of which are generally referred to as the upper class, working class, farmers, and themselves. Along these lines, the founder of Hull-House, Jane Addams, coined the term &quot;association&quot; as a counter to Individualism, with association referring to the search for a relationship between the classes. Additionally, the middle class (most notably women) began to move away from prior Victorian era domestic values. Divorce rates increased as women preferred to seek education and freedom from the home. Victorianism was pushed aside by the rise of progressivism.

===Leaders and activists===

====Politicians====
=====Democrat William Jennings Bryan=====
A very young (35 years old) upstart, Congressman William Jennings Bryan made the stunning &quot;cross of gold&quot; speech, which brought the crowd at the 1896 Democratic convention to its feet and got him the nomination. The conservative supporters of President Grover Cleveland were routed and Democrats nominate Bryan on a platform of &quot;free silver&quot;, which hopefully would make money available in the deeply depressed economy, hurt the nasty gold-hoarding bankers and uplift the honest workers and farmers. Bryan lost the election, but remained the Democratic hero and was renominated and lost again in 1900 and likewise in 1908. Bryan selected Woodrow Wilson as the party candidate in 1912 and became secretary of State. The anti-Bryan conservative Democrats did nominate their candidate in 1904, but otherwise Bryan and Bryan&#x27;s supporters largely dominated the party from 1896 to 1914. Historian David Sarasohn evaluated the Democratic party in the Bryan era:Democrats [were] an issue-oriented party (tariff and child labor reform, trust regulation, federal income tax, direct election of senators) and an emerging national coalition (southerners, western Progressives, blue-collar ethnic voters, and liberal intellectuals), most of whom shared a grudging but genuine admiration for their titular leader, William Jennings Bryan. Indeed, it is the Commoner [Bryan] whose spirit, vision, and yes, political sagacity, pervades the narrative. 

=====Republican Robert M. La Follette and Wisconsin=====
Robert M. La Follette and his family were the dominant forces of progressivism in Wisconsin from the late 1890s to the early 1940s. They started by taking over the Republican Party and then formed their own statewide &quot;Progressive Party. He tried for the Republican presidential nomination in 1912 but blundered badly in a highly embarrassing speech to leading journalists, and many of his supporters moved to Roosevelt&#x27;s camp. Starting as a loyal organizational Republican, he broke with the bosses in the late 1890s, built up a network of local organizers loyal to him, and fought for control of the state Republican Party, with mixed success. The Democrats were a minor factor in the state, but he did form coalitions with the active Socialist Party in Milwaukee. He failed to win the nomination for governor in 1896 and 1898 before winning the 1900 gubernatorial election. As governor of Wisconsin, La Follette compiled a progressive record, implementing primary elections and tax reform. La Follette won re-election in 1902 and 1904. In 1905 the legislature elected him to the United States Senate, where he emerged as a national progressive leader, often clashing with conservatives like Senator Nelson Aldrich. He initially supported President Taft, but broke with Taft after the latter failed to push a reduction in tariff rates. He challenged Taft for the Republican presidential nomination in the 1912 presidential election, but his candidacy was overshadowed by Theodore Roosevelt. La Follette&#x27;s refusal to support Roosevelt, and especially his suicidal ranting speech before media leaders in February 1912, alienated many progressives. La Follette forfeited his stature as a national leader of progressive Republicans, while remaining a power in Wisconsin.

La Follette supported some of President Wilson&#x27;s policies, but he broke with the president over foreign policy, thereby gaining support from Wisconsin&#x27;s large German and Scandinavian elements. During World War I, La Follette was the most outspoken opponent of the administration&#x27;s domestic and international policies.

With the major parties each nominating conservative candidates in the 1924 presidential election, left-wing groups coalesced behind La Follette&#x27;s third-party candidacy. With the support of the Socialist Party, farmer&#x27;s groups, labor unions, and others, La Follette was strong in Wisconsin, and to a much lesser extent in the West. He called for government ownership of railroads and electric utilities, cheap credit for farmers, stronger laws to help labor unions, and protections for civil liberties. La Follette won 17% of the popular vote and carried only his home state in the face of a Republican landslide. After his death in 1925 his sons, Robert M. La Follette Jr. and Philip La Follette, succeeded him as progressive leaders in Wisconsin.

=====Republican Theodore Roosevelt=====
President Theodore Roosevelt was a leader of the Progressive movement, and he championed his &quot;Square Deal&quot; domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. He made conservation a top priority and established many new national parks, forests, and monuments intended to preserve the nation&#x27;s natural resources. In foreign policy, he focused on Central America where he began construction of the Panama Canal. He expanded the army and sent the Great White Fleet on a world tour to project the United States naval power around the globe. His successful efforts to broker the end of the Russo-Japanese War won him the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize. He avoided controversial tariff and money issues. He was elected to a full term in 1904 and continued to promote progressive policies, some of which were passed in Congress. By 1906 he was moving to the left, advocating some social welfare programs, and criticizing various business practices such as trusts. The leadership of the GOP in Congress moved to the right, as did his protégé President William Howard Taft. Roosevelt broke bitterly with Taft in 1910, and also with Wisconsin&#x27;s progressive leader Robert M. La Follette. Taft defeated Roosevelt for the 1912 Republican nomination and Roosevelt set up an entirely new Progressive Party. It called for a &quot;New Nationalism&quot; with active supervision of corporations, higher taxes, and unemployment and old-age insurance. He supported voting rights for women but was silent on civil rights for blacks, who remained in the regular Republican fold. He lost and his new party collapsed, as conservatism dominated the GOP for decades to come. Biographer William Harbaugh argues:
:: In foreign affairs, Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s legacy is judicious support of the national interest and promotion of world stability through the maintenance of a balance of power; creation or strengthening of international agencies, and resort to their use when practicable; and implicit resolve to use military force, if feasible, to foster legitimate American interests. In domestic affairs, it is the use of government to advance the public interest. &quot;If on this new continent&quot;, he said, &quot;we merely build another country of great but unjustly divided material prosperity, we shall have done nothing&quot;.

=====Democrat Woodrow Wilson=====
Woodrow Wilson gained a national reputation as governor of New Jersey by defeating the bosses and pushing through a progressive agenda. For a time Wilson identified himself with conservatism, but by the time he became governor of New Jersey Wilson identified himself as a radical. As president he introduced a comprehensive program of domestic legislation. He had four major domestic priorities: the conservation of natural resources, banking reform, tariff reduction, and opening access to raw materials by breaking up Western mining trusts. Though foreign affairs would unexpectedly dominate his presidency, Wilson&#x27;s first two years in office largely focused on the implementation of his New Freedom domestic agenda.

Wilson presided over the passage of his progressive New Freedom domestic agenda. His first major priority was the passage of the Revenue Act of 1913, which lowered tariffs and implemented a federal income tax. Later tax acts implemented a federal estate tax and raised the top income tax rate to 77 percent. Wilson also presided over the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, which created a central banking system in the form of the Federal Reserve System. Two major laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act, were passed to regulate business and prevent monopolies. Wilson did not support civil rights and did not object to accelerating segregate of federal employees. In World War I, he made internationalism a key element of the progressive outlook, as expressed in his Fourteen Points and the League of Nations—an ideal called Wilsonianism.

=====Republican Charles Evans Hughes=====
In New York Republican Governor Charles Evans Hughes was known for exposing the insurance industry. During his time in office he promoted a range of reforms. As presidential candidate in 1916 he lost after alienating progressive California voters. As Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, he often sided with Oliver Wendell Holmes in upholding popular reforms such as the minimum wage, workmen&#x27;s compensation, and maximum work hours for women and children. He also wrote several opinions upholding the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause. His majority opinion in the &quot;Baltimore and Ohio Railroad v. Interstate Commerce Commission&quot; upheld the right of the federal government to regulate the hours of railroad workers. His majority opinion in the 1914 Shreveport Rate Case upheld a decision by the Interstate Commerce Commission to void discriminatory railroad rates imposed by the Railroad Commission of Texas. The decision established that the federal government could regulate intrastate commerce when it affected interstate commerce, though Hughes avoided directly overruling the 1895 case of &quot;United States v. E. C. Knight Co.&quot; As Chief Justice of the Supreme Court he took a moderate middle position and upheld key New Deal laws.

====Activists and Muckrakers ====
=====Gifford Pinchot=====
Gifford Pinchot was an American forester and political activist. Pinchot served as the first Chief of the United States Forest Service from 1905 until 1910 and was the 28th Governor of Pennsylvania, serving from 1923 to 1927, and again from 1931 to 1935. He was a member of the Republican Party for most of his life, though he also joined the Progressive Party for a brief period. Pinchot is known for reforming the management and development of forests in the United States and for advocating the conservation of the nation&#x27;s reserves by planned use and renewal. He called it &quot;the art of producing from the forest whatever it can yield for the service of man.&quot; Pinchot coined the term conservation ethic as applied to natural resources. Pinchot&#x27;s main contribution was his leadership in promoting scientific forestry and emphasizing the controlled, profitable use of forests and other natural resources so they would be of maximum benefit to mankind. He was the first to demonstrate the practicality and profitability of managing forests for continuous cropping. His leadership put the conservation of forests high on America&#x27;s priority list.

=====Herbert Croly=====
Herbert Croly was an intellectual leader of the movement as an editor, political philosopher and a co-founder of the magazine &quot;The New Republic&quot;. His political philosophy influenced many leading progressives including Theodore Roosevelt, Adolph Berle, as well as his close friends Judge Learned Hand and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter.

Croly&#x27;s 1909 book &quot;The Promise of American Life&quot; looked to the constitutional liberalism as espoused by Alexander Hamilton, combined with the radical democracy of Thomas Jefferson. The book influenced contemporaneous progressive thought, shaping the ideas of many intellectuals and political leaders, including then ex-President Theodore Roosevelt. Calling themselves &quot;The New Nationalists&quot;, Croly and Walter Weyl sought to remedy the relatively weak national institutions with a strong federal government. He promoted a strong army and navy and attacked pacifists who thought democracy at home and peace abroad was best served by keeping America weak.

Croly was one of the founders of modern liberalism in the United States, especially through his books, essays and a highly influential magazine founded in 1914, &quot;The New Republic&quot;. In his 1914 book &quot;Progressive Democracy&quot;, Croly rejected the thesis that the liberal tradition in the United States was inhospitable to anti-capitalist alternatives. He drew from the American past a history of resistance to capitalist wage relations that was fundamentally liberal, and he reclaimed an idea that progressives had allowed to lapse—that working for wages was a lesser form of liberty. Increasingly skeptical of the capacity of social welfare legislation to remedy social ills, Croly argued that America&#x27;s liberal promise could be redeemed only by syndicalist reforms involving workplace democracy. His liberal goals were part of his commitment to American republicanism.

=====Upton Sinclair=====
Upton Sinclair was an American writer who wrote nearly 100 books and other works in several genres. Sinclair&#x27;s work was well known and popular in the first half of the 20th century, and he won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1943. In 1906, Sinclair acquired particular fame for his classic muck-raking novel &quot;The Jungle&quot;, which exposed labor and sanitary conditions in the U.S. meatpacking industry, causing a public uproar that contributed in part to the passage a few months later of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act. In 1919, he published &quot;The Brass Check&quot;, a muck-raking exposé of American journalism that publicized the issue of yellow journalism and the limitations of the &quot;free press&quot; in the United States. Four years after publication of &quot;The Brass Check&quot;, the first code of ethics for journalists was created.

=====Ida Tarbell=====
Ida Tarbell, a writer and lecturer, was one of the leading muckrakers and pioneered investigative journalism. Tarbell is best known for her 1904 book, &quot;The History of the Standard Oil Company.&quot; The book was published as a series of articles in &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from 1902 to 1904. The work helped turn elite public opinion against the Standard Oil monopoly.

=====Lincoln Steffens=====
Lincoln Steffens was another investigative journalist and one of the leading muckrakers. He launched a series of articles in &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot;, called &quot;Tweed Days in St. Louis&quot;, that would later be published together in a book titled &quot;The Shame of the Cities&quot;. He is remembered for investigating corruption in municipal government in American cities and leftist values.

==State and local activity==
According to James Wright, the typical progressive agenda at the state level included:

A reduction of corporate influence, open processes of government and politics, equity entrance in taxation, efficiency in government mental operation, and an expanded, albeit limited, state responsibility to the citizens who are most vulnerable and deprived.

In the South, prohibition was high on the agenda but controversial. Jim Crow and disenfranchisement of Black voters was even higher on the agenda. In the Western states, woman suffrage was a success story, but racist anti-Asian sentiment also prevailed. In the East, every state had a progressive movement, but the conservative forces were usually more powerful. As an organized grassroots insurgency force the progressive movement was weak in New England. For example, &quot;Massachusetts never caught the spirit of change which dominated the era, and consequently it appeared, at best, merely conservative.&quot; When Theodore Roosevelt became governor of New York in 1898, his progressivism annoyed party leaders. They ended his reelection plans in 1900 by getting him placed on the national ticket as McKinley&#x27;s running mate for vice president. Belatedly progressivism emerged around 1905 under Governor Charles Evans Hughes.

===Western states===

====Oregon====
The Oregon Direct Legislation League was an organization of political activists founded by William S. U&#x27;Ren in 1898. Oregon was one of the few states where former Populists like U&#x27;Ren became progressive leaders. U&#x27;Ren had been inspired by reading the influential 1893 book &quot;Direct Legislation Through the Initiative and Referendum&quot;, and the group&#x27;s founding followed in the wake of the 1896 founding of the National Direct Legislation League, which itself had its roots in the Direct Legislation League of New Jersey and its short-lived predecessor, the People&#x27;s Power League.

The group led efforts in Oregon to establish an initiative and referendum system, allowing direct legislation by the state&#x27;s citizens. In 1902, the Oregon Legislative Assembly approved such a system, which was known at the time as the &quot;Oregon System&quot;.

The group&#x27;s further efforts led to successful ballot initiatives implementing a direct primary system in 1904, and allowing citizens to directly recall public officials in 1908.

Democrats who promoted progressive policies included George Earle Chamberlain (governor 1903–1909 and senator 1909–1921); Oswald West (governor 1911–1915); and Harry Lane (senator 1913–1917). The most important Republican was Jonathan Bourne Jr. (senator 1907–1913 and national leader of progressive causes 1911–1912).

====California====
California built the most successful grass roots progressive movement in the country by mobilizing independent organizations and largely ignoring the conservative state parties. The system continues strong into the 21st century. Following the Oregon model, John Randolph Haynes organized the Direct Legislation League of California in 1902 to launch the campaign for inclusion of the initiative and referendum in the state&#x27;s constitution. The League sent questionnaires to prospective candidates to the state legislature to obtain their stance on direct legislation and to make those positions public. It then flooded the state with letters seeking new members, money, and endorsements from organizations like the State Federation of Labor. As membership grew it worked with other private organizations to petition the state legislature, which was not responsive. In 1902 the League won a state constitutional amendment establishing direct democracy at the local level, and in 1904, it successfully engineered the recall of the first public official.

===South===
Progressivism was strongest in the cities, but the South was rural with few large cities. Nevertheless, statewide progressive movements were organized by Democrats in every Southern state. Furthermore, Southern Democrats in Congress gave strong support to President Wilson&#x27;s reforms.
====African American role====
African Americans developed their own version of the Progressive Movement, with two different approaches led in the South by Booker T. Washington and the Black business community, versus W.E.B. DuBois and the NAACP in the North.

The South was a main target of Northern philanthropy designed to fight poverty and disease, and help the black community. Booker T. Washington of the National Negro Business League mobilized small black-owned business and secured access to Northern philanthropy. Across the South the General Education Board (funded by the Rockefeller family) provided large-scale subsidies for black schools, which otherwise continued to be underfunded. The South was targeted in the 1920s and 1930s by the Julius Rosenwald Fund, which contributed matching funds to local communities for the construction of thousands of schools for African Americans in rural areas throughout the South. Black parents donated land and labor to build improved schools for their children.

====North Carolina====
North Carolina took a leadership role in modernizing the south, notably in expansion of public education and the state university system and improvements in transportation, which earned it the nickname &quot;The Good Roads State.&quot; State leaders included Governor Charles B. Aycock, who led both the educational and the white supremacy crusades; diplomat Walter Hines Page; and educator Charles Duncan McIver. Women were especially active through the WCTU, the Baptist church, overseas missions, local public schools, and in the cause of prohibition, leading North Carolina to become the first southern state to implement statewide prohibition. Progressives worked to limit child labor in textile mills and supported public health campaigns to eradicate hookworm and other debilitating diseases. While the majority of North Carolininans continued to support traditional gender roles, and state legislators did not ratify the Nineteenth Amendment until 1971, Progressive reformers like Gertrude Weil and Dr. Elizabeth Delia Dixon Carroll lobbied for woman suffrage.

Following the Wilmington massacre, North Carolina imposed strict legal segregation and rewrote its constitution in order to disfranchise Black men through poll taxes and literacy tests. In the Black community, Charlotte Hawkins Brown built the Palmer Memorial Institute to provide a liberal arts education to Black children and promote excellence and leadership. Brown worked with Booker T. Washington (in his role with the National Negro Business League), who provided ideas and access to Northern philanthropy.

===Midwest===
Apart from Wisconsin, the Midwestern states were about average in supporting Progressive reforms. Ohio took the lead in municipal reform.

The negative effects of industrialization triggered the political movement of progressivism, which aimed to address its negative consequences through social reform and government regulation. Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr pioneered the settlement house outreach to newly arrived immigrants by establishing Hull House in Chicago in 1889. Settlement houses provided social services and played an active role in civic life, helping immigrants prepare for naturalization and campaigning for regulation and services from city government. Midwestern mayors—especially Hazen S. Pingree and Tom L. Johnson, led early reforms against boss-dominated municipal politics, while Samuel M. Jones advocated public ownership of local utilities. Robert M. La Follette, the most famous leader of Midwestern progressivism, began his career by winning election against his state&#x27;s Republican party in 1900. The machine was temporarily defeated, allowing reformers to launch the &quot;Wisconsin idea&quot; of expanded democracy. This idea included major reforms such as direct primaries, campaign finance, civil service, anti-lobbying laws, state income and inheritance taxes, child labor restrictions, pure food, and workmen&#x27;s compensation laws. La Follette promoted government regulation of railroads, public utilities, factories, and banks. Although La Follette lost influence in the national party in 1912, the Wisconsin reforms became a model for national progressivism.

====Wisconsin====
Wisconsin from 1900 to the late 1930s was a regional and national model for innovation and organization in the progressive movement. The direct primary made it possible to mobilize voters against the previously dominant political machines. The first factors involved the La Follette family going back and forth between trying to control of the Republican Party and if frustrated trying third-party activity especially in 1924 and the 1930s. Secondly the Wisconsin idea, of intellectuals and planners based at the University of Wisconsin shaping government policy. LaFollette started as a traditional Republican in the 1890s, where he fought against populism and other radical movements. He broke decisively with the state Republican leadership, and took control of the party by 1900, all the time quarreling endlessly with ex-allies.

The Democrats were a minor conservative factor in Wisconsin. The Socialists, with a strong German and union base in Milwaukee, joined the progressives in statewide politics. Senator Robert M. La Follette tried to use his national reputation to challenge President Taft for the Republican nomination in 1912. However, as soon as Roosevelt declared his candidacy, most of La Follette&#x27;s supporters switched away. La Follette supported many of his Wilson&#x27;s domestic programs in Congress. However he strongly opposed Wilson&#x27;s foreign policy, and mobilized the large German and Scandinavian elements which demanded neutrality in the World War I. He finally ran an independent campaign for president in 1924 that appealed to the German Americans, labor unions, socialists, and more radical reformers. He won 1/6 of the national vote, but carried only his home state. After his death in 1925 his two sons took over the party. They serve terms as governor and senator and set up a third party in the state. The third party fell apart in the 1930s, and totally collapsed by 1946.

The Wisconsin Idea was the commitment of the University of Wisconsin under President Charles R. Van Hise, with LaFollette support, to use the university&#x27;s powerful intellectual resources to develop practical progressive reforms for the state and indeed for the nation.

Between 1901 and 1911, Progressive Republicans in Wisconsin created the nation&#x27;s first comprehensive statewide primary election system, the first effective workplace injury compensation law, and the first state income tax, making taxation proportional to actual earnings. The key leaders were Robert M. La Follette and (in 1910) Governor Francis E. McGovern. However, in 1912 McGovern supported Roosevelt for president and LaFollette was outraged. He made sure the next legislature defeated the governor&#x27;s programs, and that McGovern was defeated in his bid for the Senate in 1914. The Progressive movement split into hostile factions. Some was based on personalities—especially La Follette&#x27;s style of violent personal attacks against other Progressives, and some was based on who should pay, with the division between farmers (who paid property taxes) and the urban element (which paid income taxes). This disarray enabled the conservatives (called &quot;Stalwarts&quot;) to elect Emanuel Philipp as governor in 1914. The Stalwart counterattack said the Progressives were too haughty, too beholden to experts, too eager to regulate, and too expensive. Economy and budget cutting was their formula.

The progressive Wisconsin Idea promoted the use of the University of Wisconsin faculty as intellectual resources for state government, and as guides for local government. It promoted expansion of the university through the UW-Extension system to reach all the state&#x27;s farming communities. University economics professors John R. Commons and Harold Groves enabled Wisconsin to create the first unemployment compensation program in the United States in 1932. Other Wisconsin Idea scholars at the university generated the plan that became the New Deal&#x27;s Social Security Act of 1935, with Wisconsin expert Arthur J. Altmeyer playing the key role. The Stalwarts counterattacked by arguing if the university became embedded in the state, then its internal affairs became fair game, especially the faculty preference for advanced research over undergraduate teaching. The Stalwarts controlled the Regents, and their interference in academic freedom outraged the faculty. Historian Frederick Jackson Turner, the most famous professor, quit and went to Harvard.

====Illinois====
Chicago was a hotbed for reform, led by the Hull House circle. Philosopher John Dewey and Ella Flagg Young at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Laboratory School influenced educational philosophy and practice nationwide. The collaboration between Dewey and Hull House residents shaped progressive education reforms that were adopted in other parts of the country. 

Florence Kelley worked at Hull House from 1891 to 1899 and was appointed Illinois&#x27;s first chief factory inspector in 1893. She used this position to expose abusive working conditions, especially for children, and successfully lobbied for the creation of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

Ida B. Wells-Barnett moved to Chicago in 1895 and became a leading civil rights journalist and anti-lynching activist. She founded the Illinois Negro Women&#x27;s Club and the Alpha Suffrage Club of Chicago, worked as a probation officer, and helped establish the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1910. 

=====Jane Addams=====
Jane Addams was an American settlement activist, reformer, social worker, sociologist, public administrator and author. She was a notable figure in the history of social work and women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States and an advocate of world peace. She co-founded Chicago&#x27;s Hull House, one of America&#x27;s most famous settlement houses. In 1920, she was a co-founder for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). In 1931, she became the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and is recognized as the founder of the social work profession in the United States. Maurice Hamington considered her a radical pragmatist and the first woman &quot;public philosopher&quot; in the United States. In the 1930s, she was the best-known female public figure in the United States.

====Kansas====
State leaders in reform included editor William Allen White, who reached a national audience, and Governor Walter R. Stubbs. According to Gene Clanton&#x27;s study of Kansas, populism and progressivism have a few similarities but different bases of support. Both opposed corruption and trusts. Populism emerged earlier and came out of the farm community. It was radically egalitarian in favor of the disadvantaged classes. It was weak in the towns and cities except in labor unions. Progressivism, on the other hand, was a later movement. It emerged after the 1890s from the urban business and professional communities. Most of its activists had opposed populism. It was elitist, and emphasized education and expertise. Its goals were to enhance efficiency, reduce waste, and enlarge the opportunities for upward social mobility. However, some former Populists changed their emphasis after 1900 and supported progressive reforms.

====Ohio====
Ohio was distinctive for municipal reform in the major cities, especially Toledo, Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton. The middle class lived in leafy neighborhoods in the city and took the trolley to work in downtown offices. The working class saved money by walking to their factory jobs; municipal reformers appealed to the middle-class vote, by attacking the high fares and mediocre service of privately owned transit companies. They often proposed city ownership of the transit lines, but the homeowners were reluctant to save a penny on fares by paying more dollars in property taxes 

Dayton, Ohio, was under the reform leadership of John Patterson, the hard-charging chief executive of National Cash Register company. He appealed to the businessman with the gospel of efficiency in municipal affairs, run by non-partisan experts like himself. He wanted a city manager form of government in which outside experts would bring efficiency while elected officials would have little direct power, and bribery would not prevail. When the city council balked at his proposals, he threatened to move the National Cash Register factories to another city, and they fell in line. A massive flood in Dayton in 1913 killed 400 people and caused $100 million in property damage. Patterson took charge of the relief work and demonstrated in person the sort of business leaders he proposed. Dayton adopted his policies; by 1920, 177 American cities had followed suit and adopted city manager governments.

====Iowa====
Iowa had a mixed record. The spirit of progressivism emerged in the 1890s, peaked in the 1900s, and decayed after 1917. Under the guidance of Governor (1902–1908) and Senator (1908–1926) Albert Baird Cummins the &quot;Iowa Idea&quot; played a role in state and national reform. A leading Republican, Cummins fought to break up monopolies. His Iowa successes included establishing the direct primary to allow voters to select candidates instead of bosses; outlawing free railroad passes for politicians; imposing a two-cents-per-mile railway maximum passenger fare; imposing pure food and drug laws; and abolishing corporate campaign contributions. He tried, without success, to lower the high protective tariff in Washington.

Women put women&#x27;s suffrage on the state agenda. It was led by local chapters of the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, whose main goal was to impose prohibition. In keeping with the general reform mood of the latter 1860s and 1870s, the issue first received serious consideration when both houses of the General Assembly passed a women&#x27;s suffrage amendment to the state constitution in 1870. Two years later, however, when the legislature had to consider the amendment again before it could be submitted to the general electorate. It was defeated because interest had waned, and strong opposition had developed especially in the German-American community, which feared women would impose prohibition. Finally, in 1920, Iowa got woman suffrage with the rest of the country by the 19th amendment to the federal Constitution.

==Key ideas and issues==
According to historian Nancy Cohen: During the Progressive Era . . . the minimal state of an earlier liberalism was abandoned in favor of one with the power to intervene in the market and to promote social welfare. The progressives’ new liberalism, most historians conclude, was fundamentally reformist; it sought to use state power to regulate the capitalist economy and to improve the living conditions and ‘‘security’’ of the citizenry, without abolishing private property or revolutionizing liberal democratic political institutions. 
===Antitrust===
Standard Oil, with its near monopoly on refining oil, was widely hated. Many newspapers reprinted attacks from a flagship Democratic newspaper, &quot;The New York World&quot;, which made this trust a special target. For example, a feature article in 1897 stated:

There has been no outrage too colossal, no petty meanness too contemptible for these freebooters to engage in. From hounding and driving prosperous businessman to beggery and suicide, to holding up and plundering widows and orphans, the little dealer in the country and the crippled peddler on the highway—all this is entered into the exploits of this organized gang of commercial bandits.

There were legal efforts to curtail the oil monopoly in the Midwest and South. Tennessee, Illinois, Kentucky and Kansas took the lead in 1904–1905, followed by Arkansas, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia. The results were mixed. Federal action finally won out in 1911, splitting Standard Oil into 33 companies. The 33 seldom competed with each other. The federal decision together with the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 and the creation that year of the Federal Trade Commission largely de-escalated the antitrust rhetoric among progressives. The new framework after 1914 had little or no impact on the direction and magnitude of merger activity.

===Primaries===
By 1890, the secret ballot was widely adopted by the states for elections, which was non-controversial and resulted in the elimination of purchased votes since the purchaser couldn&#x27;t determine how the voter cast their vote. Despite this change, the candidates were still selected by party conventions. In the 1890s, the South witnessed a decrease in the possibility of Republican or Populist or coalition victories in most elections, with the Democratic Party gaining full control over all statewide Southern elections. To prevent factionalism within the Democratic Party, Southern states began implementing primaries. However, candidates who competed in the primaries and lost were prohibited from running as independents in the fall election. Louisiana was the first state to introduce primaries in 1892, and by 1907, eleven Southern and border states had implemented statewide primaries.

In the North, Robert LaFollette introduced the primary in Wisconsin in 1904. Most Northern states followed suit, with reformers proclaiming grass roots democracy. The party leaders and bosses also wanted direct primaries to minimize the risk of sore losers running as independents.

When candidates for office were selected by the party caucus (meetings open to the public) or by statewide party conventions of elected delegates, the public lost a major opportunity to shape policy. The progressive solution was the &quot;open&quot; primary by which any citizen could vote, or the &quot;closed&quot; primary limited to party members. In the early 20th century most states adopted the system for local and state races—but only 14 used it for delegates to the national presidential nominating conventions. The biggest battles came in New York state, where the conservatives fought hard for years against several governors until the primary was finally adopted in 1913.

===Government reform===
Disturbed by the waste, inefficiency, stubbornness, corruption, and injustices of the Gilded Age, the Progressives were committed to changing and reforming every aspect of the state, society and economy. Significant changes enacted at the national levels included the imposition of an income tax with the Sixteenth Amendment, direct election of Senators with the Seventeenth Amendment, prohibition of alcohol with the Eighteenth Amendment, election reforms to stop corruption and fraud, and women&#x27;s suffrage through the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

A main objective of the Progressive Era movement was to eliminate corruption within the government. They also made it a point to focus on family, education, and many other important aspects that still are enforced today. The most important political leaders during this time were Theodore Roosevelt and Robert M. La Follette. Key Democratic leaders were William Jennings Bryan, Woodrow Wilson, and Al Smith.

This movement targeted the regulations of huge monopolies and corporations. This was done through antitrust laws to promote equal competition among every business. This was done through the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Act of 1914, and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914.

====City manager====
At the local level the new city manager system was designed by progressives to increase efficiency and reduce partisanship and avoid the bribery of elected local officials. Kansas was a leader, where it was promoted in the press, led by Henry J. Allen of the &quot;Wichita Beacon&quot;, and pushed through by Governor Arthur Capper. Eventually 52 Kansas cities used the system.

===Family roles===
By the late 19th century, urban and rural governments had systems in place for welfare to the poor and incapacitated. Progressives argued these needs deserved a higher priority. Local public assistance programs were reformed to try to keep families together. Inspired by crusading Judge Ben Lindsey of Denver, cities established juvenile courts to deal with disruptive teenagers without sending them to adult prisons.

===Pure food, drugs, and water===
The purity of food, milk, and drinking water became a high priority in the cities. At the state and national levels new food and drug laws strengthened urban efforts to guarantee the safety of the food system. The 1906 federal Pure Food and Drug Act, which was pushed by drug companies and providers of medical services, removed from the market patent medicines that had never been scientifically tested.

With the decrease in standard working hours, urban families had more leisure time. Many spent this leisure time at movie theaters. Progressives advocated censorship of motion pictures as it was believed that patrons (especially children) viewing movies in dark, unclean, potentially unsafe theaters, might be negatively influenced in witnessing actors portraying crimes, violence, and sexually suggestive situations. Progressives across the country influenced municipal governments of large urban cities, to build numerous parks where it was believed that leisure time for children and families could be spent in a healthy, wholesome environment, thereby fostering good morals and citizenship.

===Public health===

====Social hygiene movement====
The social hygiene movement brought together different groups that were concerned with venereal disease, prostitution, society&#x27;s moral standards, and family life. The primary objective was to enhance public health and promote social morality, specifically in matters concerning sexuality and reproductive health. The movement targeted prostitution or &quot;white slavery&quot; and aimed to eliminate it by criminalizing it and enforcing stricter penalties for those involved in the sex trade. When the US entered the war a high priority was to end prostitution in proximity to military installations. The result was a permanent closing of red light districts in major cities.

Besides public health, the social hygiene movement also aimed to uphold moral purity and family values. The Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA) were among the leading groups that encouraged abstinence and discouraged premarital sex. They also advocated for more stringent censorship of literature and entertainment deemed morally unacceptable. While the social hygiene movement achieved considerable success in promoting public health and morality, its approach of criminalizing prostitution and promoting abstinence failed to address the underlying causes of these issues, such as poverty, economic inequality, and gender inequality. Moreover, its strict moral standards often marginalized groups such as immigrants and African Americans. Nonetheless, the movement genuinely sought to promote public health and social morality and to create a more stable and ordered society.

==Social welfare==

Various social services were also expanded during the course of the Progressive Era. Milk codes were drawn up in most cities, while milk depots were set up. As noted by one study, these depots &quot;sold milk at cost or provided it free of charge for needy persons.&quot; Progress was made in tackling slum housing, while city governments established a wide range of services. These included free school meals for poor school children, free dental and medical examinations for school children, day nurseries, baby clinics, and public playgrounds. Mothers&#x27; pensions were also set up in various states; designed to help widows in need.

In 1894 and 1895, Mayor of Detroit Hazen S. Pingree set up what became known as the Potato Patch plan, which was aimed at helping unemployed individuals in those years. This involved vacant lots in the suburbs being used in parcels upon which, as noted by one study, “potatoes and garden truck were planted and cultivated by needy families under the supervision of a committee, funds being raised by subscriptions and the use of the land permitted by its owners.” Many other cities went on to adopt Detroit’s plan. 
==Labor policy and unions==
There were many dramatic changes in the condition of American workers from 1915 to 2015.

Labor unions, especially those affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), grew rapidly in the early 20th century, and had a progressive agenda as well. After experimenting in the early 20th century with cooperation with business in the National Civic Federation, the AFL turned after 1906 to a working political alliance with the Democratic Party. The alliance was especially important in the larger industrial cities. The unions wanted restrictions on judges who intervened in labor disputes, usually on the side of the employer. They finally achieved that goal with the Norris–La Guardia Act of 1932.

President Taft signed the March 4, 1913, bill (the last day of his presidency), establishing the Department of Labor as a Cabinet-level department, replacing the previous Department of Commerce and Labor. William B. Wilson was appointed as the first Secretary of Labor on March 5, 1913, by President Wilson. In October 1919, Secretary Wilson chaired the first meeting of the International Labour Organization even though the U.S. was not yet a member.

In September 1916, the Federal Employees&#x27; Compensation Act introduced benefits to workers who are injured or contract illnesses in the workplace. The act established an agency responsible for federal workers&#x27; compensation, which was transferred to the Labor Department in the 1940s and has become known as the Office of Workers&#x27; Compensation Programs.

Several other laws aimed at helping working people were passed during the course of the Progressive Era.

==Women==

Across the nation, middle-class women organized on behalf of social reforms during the Progressive Era. Using the language of municipal housekeeping women were able to push such reforms as prohibition, women&#x27;s suffrage, child-saving, and public health.

Middle-class women formed local clubs, which after 1890 were coordinated by the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs (GFWC). Historian Paige Meltzer puts the GFWC in the context of the Progressive Movement, arguing that its policies:

built on Progressive-era strategies of municipal housekeeping. During the Progressive era, female activists used traditional constructions of womanhood, which imagined all women as mothers and homemakers, to justify their entrance into community affairs: as &quot;municipal housekeepers,&quot; they would clean up politics, cities, and see after the health and well-being of their neighbors. Donning the mantle of motherhood, female activists methodically investigated their community&#x27;s needs and used their &quot;maternal&quot; expertise to lobby, create, and secure a place for themselves in an emerging state welfare bureaucracy, best illustrated perhaps by clubwoman Julia Lathrop&#x27;s leadership in the Children&#x27;s Bureau. As part of this tradition of maternal activism, the Progressive-era General Federation supported a range of causes from the pure food and drug administration to public health care for mothers and children, to a ban on child labor, each of which looked to the state to help implement their vision of social justice.

Some activists demanded change, and questioned the old thinking regarding marriage and sexuality. They craved more sexual freedom following the sexually repressive and restrictive Victorian era. Dating became a new way of courting during the Progressive Era and moved youth into a more romantic way of viewing marriage and relationships. Within more engagements and marriages, both parties would exchange love notes as a way to express their sexual feelings. The divide between aggressive passionate love associated usually with men and a women&#x27;s more spiritual romantic love became apparent in the middle class as women were judged on how they should be respected based on how they expressed these feelings. So, frequently women expressed passionless emotions towards love as a way to establish status among men in the middle class.

===Women&#x27;s suffrage===
The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was an American women&#x27;s rights organization formed in May 1890 as a unification of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). The NAWSA set up hundreds of smaller local and state groups, with the goal of passing woman suffrage legislation at the state and local level. The NAWSA was the largest and most important suffrage organization in the United States, and was the primary promoter of women&#x27;s right to vote. Carrie Chapman Catt was the key leader in the early 20th century. Like AWSA and NWSA before it, the NAWSA pushed for a constitutional amendment guaranteeing women&#x27;s voting rights, and was instrumental in winning the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920. A breakaway group, the National Woman&#x27;s Party, tightly controlled by Alice Paul, used civil disobedience to gain publicity and force passage of suffrage. Paul&#x27;s members chained themselves to the White House fence to get arrested, then went on hunger strikes to gain publicity. While the British suffragettes stopped their protests in 1914 and supported the British war effort, Paul began her campaign in 1917 and was widely criticized for ignoring the war and attracting radical anti-war elements.

A lesser-known feminist movement in the progressive era was the self-defense movement. According to Wendy Rouse, feminists sought to raise awareness about the sexual harassment and violence that women faced on the street, at work, and in the home. They wanted to inspire a sense of physical and personal empowerment through training in active self-defense.
==Civil rights==
===African Americans and race relations===
Across the South, black communities developed their own Progressive reform projects. Typical projects involved upgrading schools, modernizing church operations, expanding business opportunities, fighting for a larger share of state budgets, and engaging in legal action to secure equal rights. Reform projects were especially notable in rural areas, where the great majority of Southern blacks lived.

Rural blacks were heavily affected by environmental issues, in which they developed their own traditions and priorities. George Washington Carver (1860–1943) was a leader in promoting environmentalism, and was well known for his research projects, particularly those involving agriculture.

Although there were some achievements that improved conditions for African Americans and other non-white minorities, the Progressive Era was still in the midst of the nadir of American race relations. While white Progressives in principle believed in improving conditions for minority groups, there were wide differences in how this was to be achieved. Some, such as Lillian Wald, fought to alleviate the plight of poor African Americans. Many, though, were concerned with enforcing, not eradicating, racial segregation. In particular, the mixing of black and white pleasure-seekers in &quot;black-and-tan&quot; clubs troubled Progressive reformers. The Progressive ideology espoused by many of the era attempted to correct societal problems created by racial integration following the Civil War by segregating the races and allowing each group to achieve its own potential; most Progressives saw racial integration as a problem to be solved, rather than a goal to be achieved. As white Progressives sought to help the white working class, clean up politics, and improve the cities, the country instated the system of racial segregation known as Jim Crow.
===Disfranchisement of Black voters===

Beginning in the 1890s politicians in each Southern state systematically took the vote away from Black voters, usually leaving only a handful of ministers and businessmen with political power.
This practically nullified the right to vote that had been guaranteed to &quot;freedmen&quot; through the Fifteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1870. Southern whites wanted to rid of the political influence of the black vote, citing &quot;black voting meant only corruption of elections, incompetence of government, and the engendering of fierce racial antagonisms.&quot; One common technique was the literacy test, whereby election officials allowed whites to pass and almost all Blacks to fail. Disenfranchisement in the South was an action designed to purify society through segregation of the races into superior and inferior elements. 

===Booker T. Washington===
Booker T. Washington (1856-1915) was a nationally powerful Black leader between 1895 and 1915. Besides the Tuskegee University project in Alabama, he was the leading organizer of Black businessmen across the country in the National Negro Business League. Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle-class blacks, church leaders, and white philanthropists and politicians, with the goal of building the community&#x27;s economic strength and pride by focusing on self-help and education. Washington had the ear of the powerful in the America of his day, including presidents Roosevelt and Taft. He used his power in the Republican Party, in the Southern political system, to manipulate the media, raise money, develop strategy, network, distribute funds, and reward a cadre of supporters. The era 1880 to 1915, has been called the &quot;Age of Booker T. Washington.&quot; Washington called for Black progress through education and entrepreneurship, rather than trying to challenge directly Jim Crow segregation and the rapid disenfranchisement of Black voters in the South. Furthermore, he supported racial uplift, but secretly also supported court challenges to segregation and to restrictions on voter registration. Black activists in the North, led by W. E. B. Du Bois, disagreed with him and opted to set up the NAACP to work for political change.

==Key political reform efforts==

===Democracy===

Many progressives sought to enable the citizenry to rule more directly and circumvent machines, bosses and professional politicians. The institution of the initiative and referendums made it possible to pass laws without the involvement of the legislature, while the recall allowed for the removal of corrupt or under-performing officials, and the direct primary let people democratically nominate candidates, avoiding the professionally dominated conventions. Thanks to the efforts of Oregon State Representative William S. U&#x27;Ren and his Direct Legislation League, voters in Oregon overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure in 1902 that created the initiative and referendum processes for citizens to directly introduce or approve proposed laws or amendments to the state constitution, making Oregon the first state to adopt such a system. U&#x27;Ren also helped in the passage of an amendment in 1908 that gave voters power to recall elected officials, and would go on to establish, at the state level, popular election of US Senators and the first presidential primary in the United States. In 1911, California governor Hiram Johnson established the Oregon System of &quot;Initiative, Referendum, and Recall&quot; in his state, viewing them as good influences for citizen participation against the historic influence of large corporations on state lawmakers. These Progressive reforms were soon replicated in other states, including Idaho, Washington, and Wisconsin, and today roughly half of US states have initiative, referendum and recall provisions in their state constitutions.

The Seventeenth Amendment was ratified in 1913, requiring that all senators be elected by the people (they were formerly appointed by state legislatures). The main motivation was to reduce the power of political bosses, who controlled the Senate seats by virtue of their control of state legislatures. The result, according to political scientist Henry Jones Ford, was that the United States Senate had become a &quot;Diet of party lords, wielding their power without scruple or restraint, on behalf of those particular interests&quot; that put them in office.

Reformers also sought to streamline government through the introduction of the short ballot. By reducing the number of elected officials and consolidating their power in singular officials like a governor they hoped to increase accountability and clarity in government. Woodrow Wilson was at one point the President of the National Short Ballot Organization.

====Direct primary====
The direct primary became important at the state level starting in the 1890s and at the local level in the 1900s. However, presidential nominations depended chiefly on state party conventions until 1972.

The first primary elections came in the Democratic Party in the South starting in Louisiana in 1892. By 1897, in 11 Southern and border states, the Democratic Party held primaries to select candidates. Unlike the final election run by government officials, primaries are run by party officials, making it easy to discriminate against black voters in the era of Jim Crow. The US Supreme Court declared the white primary unconstitutional in &quot;Smith v. Allwright&quot; in 1944.

Insurgent Midwestern Republicans began promoting primaries starting in 1890 with Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin. He crusaded against Stalwart party bosses of the state Republican Party, and won voter approval in a referendum in 1904. While La Follette always won his primary, that was not necessarily the case with other progressives. For example, his son Bob La Follette lost his Senate seat in the 1946 primary to Joseph McCarthy, a much more energetic candidate.

In New Jersey, on the other hand, the party leaders introduced the primary in every county by 1902. Their goal was to keep the various factions united for the fall campaign and minimize ticket-splitting.

The Northeast was laggard in adopting the direct primary, with Connecticut and Rhode Island the last states to sign up. The Massachusetts Democratic Party were gravely weakened by the primary system. New York Republican Governor Charles Evans Hughes made a primary law his top goal in 1909 and failed.

===Urbanization and municipal reform===
A coalition of middle-class reform-oriented voters, academic experts, and reformers hostile to the political machines started forming in the 1890s and introduced a series of reforms in urban America, designed to reduce waste, inefficiency and corruption, by introducing scientific methods, compulsory education and administrative innovations.

The pace was set in Detroit, Michigan, where Republican mayor Hazen S. Pingree first put together the reform coalition as mayor 1889–1897. Many cities set up municipal reference bureaus to study the budgets and administrative structures of local governments.

Progressive mayors took the lead in many key cities, such as Cleveland, Ohio (especially Mayor Tom Johnson); Toledo, Ohio; Jersey City, New Jersey; Los Angeles; Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; and many other cities, especially in the western states. In Illinois, Governor Frank Lowden undertook a major reorganization of state government. In Wisconsin, the stronghold of Robert La Follette, the Wisconsin Idea used the state university as a major source of ideas and expertise.

====Gary Plan for efficient public schools====
The Gary Plan was much discussed method of building a highly efficient public school system. It was in part inspired by the educational ideas of philosopher John Dewey. It was designed by School Superintendent William Wirt in 1907 and implemented in the newly built steel mill city of Gary, Indiana. Reformers tried to copy it across the country. Wirt later promoted it in New York City. In New York City it was strongly opposed by unions and local political forces and was reversed in 1917. By 1929 over 200 cities in 41 states adopted variations of the plan. Ronald Cohen states that the Gary Plan was popular because it merged Progressive commitments to:

paedagogical and economic efficiency, growth and centralization of administration, an expanded curriculum, introduction of measurement and testing, greater public use of school facilities, a child-centered approach, and heightened concern about using the schools to properly socialize children. 

====Cities during the Progressive Era====
In the early 1900s, the United States entered a period of peace, prosperity, and progress. In the nation&#x27;s growing cities, factory output grew, small businesses flourished, and incomes rose. As the promise of jobs and higher wages attracted more and more people into the cities, the US began to shift to a nation of city dwellers. By 1900, 30 million people, or 30 percent of the total population, lived in cities.

The mass migration of people into the cities enriched some people but caused severe problems for others. For the emerging middle class, benefiting from growing incomes and increases in leisure time, the expanding city offered many advantages. Department stores, chain stores, and shopping centers emerged to meet the growing demand for material goods. Parks, amusement parks, and baseball stadiums were built to meet aesthetic and recreational needs. Transportation systems improved, as did the general infrastructure, better meeting the increased needs of the middle and upper class city dwellers.

Thousands of poor people also lived in the cities. Lured by the promise of prosperity, many rural families and immigrants from throughout the world arrived in the cities to work in the factories. It is estimated that by 1904 one in three people living in the cities was close to starving to death. For many of the urban poor, living in the city resulted in a decreased quality of life. With few city services to rely upon, the working class lived daily with overcrowding, inadequate water facilities, unpaved streets, and disease. Lagging far behind the middle class, working class wages provided little more than subsistence living and few, if any, opportunities for movement out of the city slums.

=====Business progressivism in 1920s=====
What historians have identified as &quot;business progressivism&quot;, with its emphasis on efficiency and typified by Henry Ford and Herbert Hoover reached an apogee in the 1920s. Wik, for example, argues that Ford&#x27;s &quot;views on technology and the mechanization of rural America were generally enlightened, progressive, and often far ahead of his times.&quot;

Tindall stresses the continuing importance of the progressive movement in the South in the 1920s involving increased democracy, efficient government, corporate regulation, social justice, and governmental public service. William Link finds political Progressivism dominant in most of the South in the 1920s. Likewise it was influential in the Midwest.

Historians of women and of youth emphasize the strength of the progressive impulse in the 1920s. Women consolidated their gains after the success of the suffrage movement, and moved into causes such as world peace, good government, maternal care (the Sheppard–Towner Act of 1921), and local support for education and public health. The work was not nearly as dramatic as the suffrage crusade, but women voted and operated quietly and effectively. Paul Fass, speaking of youth, says &quot;Progressivism as an angle of vision, as an optimistic approach to social problems, was very much alive.&quot; International influences that sparked many reform ideas likewise continued into the 1920s, as American ideas of modernity began to influence Europe.

By 1930, a block of progressive Republicans in the Senate were urging Hoover to take more vigorous action to fight the depression. There were about a dozen members of this group, including William Borah of Idaho, George W. Norris of Nebraska, Robert M. La Follette Jr. of Wisconsin, Gerald Nye of North Dakota, Hiram Johnson of California and Bronson M. Cutting of New Mexico. While these western Republicans could stir up issues, they could rarely forge a majority, since they were too individualistic and did not form a unified caucus. Hoover himself had sharply moved to the right, and paid little attention to their liberal ideas. By 1932, this group was moving toward support for Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. They remained staunch isolationists deeply opposed to any involvement in Europe. Outside the Senate, however, a strong majority of the surviving Progressives from the 1910s had become conservative opponents of New Deal economic planning.

====Automobiles in the Progressive and New Eras====
Sociologists Robert and Helen Lynd conducted a major study of American society during the 1920s. In 1929, they published their research in a book titled &quot;Middletown&quot;. &quot;Middletown&quot; was the name used to disguise Muncie, Indiana, the actual place where they conducted their research. One of their findings was that the automobile had transformed the lives of people living in Middletown and, by extension, virtually everywhere else in the United States.

More specifically, the Lynds found that the automobile had such effects as the following: (1) family budgets had changed dramatically; (2) ministers complained that people drove their cars rather than going to church; (3) parents were concerned that their boys and girls were spending too much time together &quot;motoring&quot;; and (4) the car had revolutionized the way people spent their free time.

These primary sources also indicate the impact of the automobile on Americans&#x27; lives. Some of those effects were seen as positive; others were much more troubling.

===Rural reform===
As late as 1920, half the population lived in rural areas. They experienced their own progressive reforms, typically with the explicit goal of upgrading country life. By 1910, most farmers subscribed to a farm newspaper, where editors promoted efficiency as applied to farming. Special efforts were made to reach the rural South and remote areas, such as the mountains of Appalachia and the Ozarks.

====Good roads====
The most urgent need was better transportation. The railroad system was virtually complete; the need was for much better roads. The traditional method of putting the burden on maintaining roads on local landowners was increasingly inadequate. New York State took the lead in 1898, and by 1916 the old system had been discarded in every area. Demands grew for local and state government to take charge. With the coming of the automobile after 1910, urgent efforts were made to upgrade and modernize dirt roads designed for horse-drawn wagon traffic. The American Association for Highway Improvement was organized in 1910. Funding came from automobile registration, and taxes on motor fuels, as well as state aid. In 1916, federal aid was first made available to improve post-roads, and promote general commerce. Congress appropriated $75 million over a five-year period, with the Secretary of Agriculture in charge through the Bureau of Public Roads, in cooperation with the state highway departments. There were 2.4 million miles of rural dirt rural roads in 1914; 100,000 miles had been improved with grading and gravel, and 3000 miles were given high quality surfacing. The rapidly increasing speed of automobiles, and especially trucks, made maintenance and repair a high priority. Concrete was first used in 1933, and expanded until it became the dominant surfacing material in the 1930s. The South had fewer cars and trucks and much less money, but it worked through highly visible demonstration projects like the &quot;Dixie Highway.&quot;

====Rural schools====
Rural schools were often poorly funded, one room operations. Typically, classes were taught by young local women before they married, with only occasional supervision by county superintendents. The progressive solution was modernization through consolidation, with the result of children attending modern schools. There they would be taught by full-time professional teachers who had graduated from the states&#x27; teachers colleges, were certified, and were monitored by the county superintendents. Farmers complained at the expense, and also at the loss of control over local affairs, but in state after state the consolidation process went forward.

Numerous other programs were aimed at rural youth, including 4-H clubs, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. County fairs not only gave prizes for the most productive agricultural practices, they also demonstrated those practices to an attentive rural audience. Programs for new mothers included maternity care and training in baby care.

===Conservation of natural resources ===
In the mid to late 19th century, natural resources were heavily exploited, especially in the West. Land speculators and developers took over large tracts of forests and grazing land. Acreage important to waterpower was seized by private concerns. Mining companies practiced improper and wasteful mining practices. Assuming a seemingly inexhaustible supply of natural resources, Americans developed a &quot;tradition of waste.&quot;

Alarmed by the public&#x27;s casual attitude toward natural resources as well as the exploitation of natural resources for private gain, conservationists called for federal supervision of the nation&#x27;s resources and the preservation of those resources for future generations. In Theodore Roosevelt, the conservationists found an energetic leader. Conservation of the nation&#x27;s resources, putting an end to wasteful uses of raw materials, and the reclamation of large areas of neglected land have been identified as some of the major achievements of the Roosevelt era.

Roosevelt&#x27;s concern for the environment was influenced by American naturalists, such as John Muir, and by his own political appointees, especially Gifford Pinchot, Chief of Forestry. Working in concert with many individuals and organizations, the Roosevelt administration was responsible for the following: the Newlands Act of 1902, which funded irrigation projects from the proceeds of the sale of federal lands in the West; the appointment of the Inland Waterways Commission in 1907 to study the relation of rivers, soil, forest, waterpower development, and water transportation; and the National Conservation Commission of 1909, which was charged with drawing up long-range plans for preserving national resources. Along with a vocal group of conservationists, the Roosevelt administration created an environmental conservation movement whose words and actions continue to be heard and felt throughout the US today.

===Modern versus traditional conflicts===
The movement&#x27;s attempts at introducing urban reforms to rural America often met resistance from traditionalists who saw the country-lifers as aggressive modernizers who were condescending and out of touch with rural life. The traditionalists said many of their reforms were unnecessary and not worth the trouble of implementing. Rural residents also disagreed with the notion that farms needed to improve their efficiency, as they saw this goal as serving urban interests more than rural ones. The social conservatism of many rural residents also led them to resist attempts for change led by outsiders. Most important, the traditionalists did not want to become modern, and did not want their children inculcated with alien modern values through comprehensive schools that were remote from local control. The most successful reforms came from the farmers who pursued agricultural extension, as their proposed changes were consistent with existing modernizing trends toward more efficiency and more profit in agriculture.

===Constitutional change===
The Progressives fixed some of their reforms into law by adding amendments 16, 17, 18, and 19 to the Constitution of the United States. The 16th amendment made an income tax legal (this required an amendment due to Article One, Section 9 of the Constitution, which required that direct taxes be laid on the States in proportion to their population as determined by the decennial census). The Progressives also made strides in attempts to reduce political corruption through the 17th amendment (direct election of U.S. Senators). The most radical and controversial amendment came during the anti-German craze of World War I that helped the Progressives and others push through their plan for prohibition through the 18th amendment (once the Progressives fell out of power the 21st amendment repealed the 18th in 1933). The ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920, which recognized women&#x27;s suffrage was the last amendment during the progressive era. Another significant constitutional change that began during the progressive era was the incorporation of the Bill of Rights so that those rights would apply to the states. In 1920, Benjamin Gitlow was convicted under the Espionage Act of 1917 and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court, where the justices decided that the First Amendment applied to the states as well as the federal government. Prior to that time, the Bill of Rights was considered to apply only to the federal government, not the states.

==National policy==

===National economic policy===
The Progressive Era was one of general prosperity after the Panic of 1893—a severe depression—ended in 1897. The Panic of 1907 was short and mostly affected financiers. However, Campbell (2005) stresses the weak points of the economy in 1907–1914, linking them to public demands for more Progressive interventions. The Panic of 1907 was followed by a small decline in real wages and increased unemployment, with both trends continuing until World War I. Campbell emphasizes the resulting stress on public finance and the impact on the Wilson administration&#x27;s policies. The weakened economy and persistent federal deficits led to changes in fiscal policy, including the imposition of federal income taxes on businesses and individuals and the creation of the Federal Reserve System. Government agencies were also transformed in an effort to improve administrative efficiency.

In the Gilded Age (late 19th century), the parties were reluctant to involve the federal government too heavily in the private sector, except in the area of railroads and tariffs. In general, they accepted the concept of laissez-faire, a doctrine opposing government interference in the economy except to maintain law and order. This attitude started to change during the depression of the 1890s when small business, farm, and labor movements began asking the government to intercede on their behalf.

By the start of the 20th century, a middle class had developed that was weary of both the business elite and the radical political movements of farmers and laborers in the Midwest and West. The progressives argued the need for government regulation of business practices to ensure competition and free enterprise. Congress enacted a law regulating railroads in 1887 (the Interstate Commerce Act), and one preventing large firms from controlling a single industry in 1890 (the Sherman Antitrust Act). These laws were not rigorously enforced, however, until the years between 1900 and 1920, when Republican President Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909), Democratic President Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921), and others sympathetic to the views of the Progressives came to power. Many of today&#x27;s US regulatory agencies were created during these years, including the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Commission. Muckrakers were journalists who encouraged readers to demand more regulation of business. Upton Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot; (1906) was influential and persuaded America about the supposed horrors of the Chicago Union Stock Yards, a giant complex of meat processing plants that developed in the 1870s. The federal government responded to Sinclair&#x27;s book and the Neill–Reynolds Report with the new regulatory Food and Drug Administration. Ida Tarbell wrote a series of articles against Standard Oil, which was perceived to be a monopoly. This affected both the government and the public reformers. Attacks by Tarbell and others helped pave the way for public acceptance of the breakup of the company by the Supreme Court in 1911.

When Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected president with a Democratic Congress in 1912 he implemented a series of Progressive policies in economics. In 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified, and a small income tax was imposed on higher incomes. The Democrats lowered tariffs with the Underwood Tariff in 1913, though its effects were overwhelmed by the changes in trade caused by the World War that broke out in 1914. Wilson proved especially effective in mobilizing public opinion behind tariff changes by denouncing corporate lobbyists, addressing Congress in person in highly dramatic fashion, and staging an elaborate ceremony when he signed the bill into law. Wilson helped end the long battles over the trusts with the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914. He managed to convince lawmakers on the issues of money and banking by the creation in 1913 of the Federal Reserve System, a complex business–government partnership that to this day dominates the financial world.

====Antitrust under Roosevelt and Taft====
Roosevelt&#x27;s antitrust record over eight years included 18 civil cases and 26 criminal antitrust cases resulting in 22 convictions and 22 acquittals. Taft&#x27;s four years had 54 civil and 36 criminal suits and Taft&#x27;s prosecutor secured 55 convictions and 35 acquittals. Taft&#x27;s cases included many leading firms in major sectors: Standard Oil; American Tobacco; United States Steel; Aluminum Company of America; International Harvester; National Cash Register; Westinghouse; General Electric; Kodak; Dupont; Union Pacific railroad; and Southern Pacific railroad. It also included trusts or combinations in beef, lumber, wine, turpentine, wallpaper, licorice, thread, and watches. The targets even included operations run by Taft&#x27;s personal friends, such as Ohio-based National Cash Register. The media gave extensive exposure, especially to cases against Standard Oil and American Tobacco, which reached directly tens of millions of consumers. Taft&#x27;s attorney general George W. Wickersham personally supervised the most important cases against Standard Oil and American Tobacco. He argued to the Supreme Court that trusts should be dissolved into their constituent parts, arguing they were artificial creations and did not achieve their positions through normal business methods and hence were guilty of violating the Sherman act. The government brief argued that dismemberment would correct this inequity and would force and restore normal competition. The Court agreed in 1911 and ordered the Justice Department to draw up complete reorganization plans in six months. Wickersham and his staff, all expert lawyers, were not experts in business management. The hurriedly created over thirty new corporations to replace Standard, plus several in tobacco.

After reorganizations prices to consumers went up, as the replacement firms lost the size efficiency of the trust. Wickersham discovered that trust busting meant higher prices for consumers. He told Taft, &quot;the disintegrated companies of both the oil and tobacco trust are spending many times what was formerly spent by anyone in advertising in the newspapers.&quot; Wickersham realized the problem but Taft never did. He insisted that antitrust lawsuits continue to the end; 16 new cases were launched in the last 2 months of the Taft administration.

==Immigration policy==
The influx of immigration grew steadily after 1896, with most new arrivals being unskilled workers from southern and eastern Europe. These immigrants were able to find work in the steel mills, slaughterhouses, and construction crews of the mill towns and industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest. Many went to rural mining districts. Few went to the South. Many intended to stay a few years, save up their wages by living frugally, and return to the homeland with enough cash to buy a small farm. However, Jewish immigrants were all permanent.

The influx ended abruptly in August 1914 as World War I halted almost all civilian movement to and from Europe. Starting in the 1880s, the labor unions aggressively promoted restrictions on immigration, especially restrictions on Chinese, Japanese and Korean immigrants. In combination with the racist attitudes of the time, there was a fear that large numbers of unskilled, low-paid workers would defeat the union&#x27;s efforts to raise wages through collective bargaining. In addition, rural Protestants distrusted the urban Catholic and Jewish immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe, and on those grounds opposed immigration. On the other hand, the rapid growth of industry called for a greater and expanding labor pool that could not be met by natural birth rates. As a result, many large corporations were opposed to immigration restrictions. By the early 1920s, a consensus had been reached that the total influx of immigration had to be restricted, and a series of laws in the 1920s accomplished that purpose. A handful of eugenics advocates were also involved in immigration restriction for their own pseudo-scientific reasons. Immigration restriction continued to be a national policy until after World War II.

During World War I, the Progressives strongly promoted Americanization programs, designed to modernize the recent immigrants and turn them into model American citizens, while diminishing loyalties to the old country. These programs often operated through the public school system, which expanded dramatically.

The Immigration Act of 1924, or Johnson–Reed Act, including the Asian Exclusion Act and National Origins Act, was a federal law that prevented immigration from Asia and set quotas on the number of immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. It also authorized the creation of the country&#x27;s first formal border control service, the US Border Patrol, and established a &quot;consular control system&quot; that allowed entry only to those who first obtained a visa from a US consulate abroad.

==Foreign policy==
Progressives looked to legal arbitration as an alternative to warfare. The two leading proponents were Taft, a constitutional lawyer who later became Chief Justice, and Democratic leader William Jennings Bryan. Taft&#x27;s political base was the conservative business community which largely supported peace movements before 1914. The businessmen believed that economic rivalries were cause of war, and that extensive trade led to an interdependent world that would make war a very expensive and useless anachronism. One early success came in the Newfoundland fisheries dispute between the United States and Britain in 1910. In 1911, Taft&#x27;s diplomats signed wide-ranging arbitration treaties with France and Britain. However he was defeated by former President Theodore Roosevelt, who had broken with his protégé Taft in 1910. They were dueling for control of the Republican Party and Roosevelt encouraged the Senate to impose amendments that significantly weakened the treaties. On the one hand, Roosevelt was acting to sabotage Taft&#x27;s campaign promises. At a deeper level, Roosevelt truly believed that arbitration was a naïve solution and the great issues had to be decided by warfare. The Roosevelt in approach incorporated a near-mystical faith of the ennobling nature of war. It endorsed jingoistic nationalism as opposed to the businessmen&#x27;s calculation of profit and national interest.

Foreign policy in the Progressive Era was often marked by a tone of moral supremacy. Woodrow Wilson and William Jennings Bryan both saw themselves as &#x27;Missionaries of Democracy&#x27;, with the deliberate religious overtone. Historian Arthur S. Link says they felt they were, &quot;Inspired by the confidence that they knew better how to promote the peace and well-being of other countries than did the leaders of those countries themselves.&quot; Similar ideas and language had already been used previously in the Monroe Doctrine, wherein Roosevelt claimed that the United States could serve as the police of the world, using its power to end unrest and wrongdoing on the western hemisphere. Using this moralistic approach, Roosevelt argued for intervention with Cuba to help it to become a &quot;just and stable civilization&quot;, by way of the Platt Amendment. Wilson used a similar moralistic tone when dealing with Mexico. In 1913, while revolutionaries took control of the government, Wilson judged them to be immoral, and refused to acknowledge the in-place government on that reason alone.

===Keeping and modernizing the Philippines===
The Philippines was acquired in 1899, after victory in the Spanish American War. It was the largest colonial acquisition by the United States in an era when the world powers were seizing colonies in Africa and Asia. While anti-imperialist sentiments had been prevalent in the United States since the 1850s, the acquisition of the Philippines sparked an intense debate. Anti-imperialists insisted that keeping the islands was &quot;un-American&quot; and unwise.

The Philippines was a major target for the progressive reformers. A 1907 report to Secretary of War Taft provided a summary of what the American civil administration had achieved. It included, in addition to the rapid building of a public school system based on English teaching, and boasted about such modernizing achievements as:

steel and concrete wharves at the newly renovated Port of Manila; dredging the River Pasig; streamlining of the Insular Government; accurate, intelligible accounting; the construction of a telegraph and cable communications network; the establishment of a postal savings bank; large-scale road- and bridge-building; impartial and incorrupt policing; well-financed civil engineering; the conservation of old Spanish architecture; large public parks; a bidding process for the right to build railways; Corporation law; and a coastal and geological survey.

In 1903, the American reformers in the Philippines passed two major land acts designed to turn landless peasants into owners of their farms. By 1905, the law was clearly a failure. Reformers such as Taft believed landownership would turn unruly agrarians into loyal subjects. The social structure in rural Philippines was highly traditional and highly unequal. Drastic changes in land ownership posed a major challenge to local elites, who would not accept it, nor would their peasant clients. The American reformers blamed peasant resistance to landownership for the law&#x27;s failure and argued that large plantations and sharecropping was the Philippines&#x27; best path to development.

Elite Filipina women played a major role in the reform movement, especially on health issues. They specialized on such urgent needs as infant care and maternal and child health, the distribution of pure milk and teaching new mothers about children&#x27;s health. The most prominent organizations were the La Protección de la Infancia, and the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs.

===Peace movement===

Although the Progressive Era was characterized by public support for World War I under Woodrow Wilson, there was also a substantial opposition to the war. Jane Addams was the most prominent leader.

==Societal reforms==

===Rhetoric of righteousness===
Mainline Protestant denominations adopted the Social Gospel. The goal was to establish a more perfect society on earth in preparation for Christ&#x27;s Second Coming. More generally the Social Gospel impulse was base on righteousness, typified by the wide influence of theologian Walter Rauschenbusch. The Presbyterians described the goal in 1910 by proclaiming:

The great ends of the church are the proclamation of the gospel for the salvation of humankind; the shelter, nurture, and spiritual fellowship of the children of God; the maintenance of divine worship; the preservation of truth; the promotion of social righteousness; and the exhibition of the Kingdom of Heaven to the world.

Many progressive leaders used the rhetoric of righteousness to motivate their Protestant supporters. Indeed, Richard Hofstadter argued that progressivism was, &quot;a phase in the history of the Protestant conscience, a latter-day Protestant revival.&quot; Wilson and Bryan were moralistic and very religious; Roosevelt and La Follette were moralistic and not very religious.

Roosevelt&#x27;s rhetoric was characterized by an intense moralism of personal righteousness. The tone was typified by his denunciation of &quot;predatory wealth&quot; in a message he sent Congress in January 1908 calling for passage of new labor laws:

Predatory wealth—of the wealth accumulated on a giant scale by all forms of iniquity, ranging from the oppression of wageworkers to unfair and unwholesome methods of crushing out competition, and to defrauding the public by stock jobbing and the manipulation of securities. Certain wealthy men of this stamp, whose conduct should be abhorrent to every man of ordinarily decent conscience, and who commit the hideous wrong of teaching our young men that phenomenal business success must ordinarily be based on dishonesty, have during the last few months made it apparent that they have banded together to work for a reaction. Their endeavor is to overthrow and discredit all who honestly administer the law, to prevent any additional legislation which would check and restrain them, and to secure if possible a freedom from all restraint which will permit every unscrupulous wrongdoer to do what he wishes unchecked provided he has enough money...The methods by which the Standard Oil people and those engaged in the other combinations of which I have spoken above have achieved great fortunes can only be justified by the advocacy of a system of morality which would also justify every form of criminality on the part of a labor union, and every form of violence, corruption, and fraud, from murder to bribery and ballot box stuffing in politics. 

===Prohibition===
Prohibition was the outlawing of the manufacture, sale and transport of alcohol. Drinking itself was never prohibited. Throughout the Progressive Era, it remained one of the prominent causes associated with progressivism at the local, state and national level, though support across the full breadth of Progressives was mixed. It pitted the minority urban Catholic population against the larger rural Protestant element, Progressivism&#x27;s rise in the rural communities was aided by the general increase in public consciousness of social issues of the temperance movement, which achieved national success with the passage of the 18th Amendment by Congress in late 1917, and the ratification by three-fourths of the states in 1919. Prohibition was backed by the Methodists, Baptists, Congregationalists, Scandinavian Lutherans and other evangelical churches. In the South, especially in Texas, prohibition was a top priority of the Protestant progressives.

Activists were mobilized by the highly effective Anti-Saloon League. Timberlake (1963) argues the dries sought to break the liquor trust, weaken the saloon base of big-city machines, enhance industrial efficiency, and reduce the level of wife beating, child abuse, and poverty caused by alcoholism. Agitation for prohibition began during the Second Great Awakening in the 1840s when crusades against drinking originated from evangelical Protestants. Evangelicals precipitated the second wave of prohibition legislation during the 1880s, which had as its aim local and state prohibition. During the 1880s, referendums were held at the state level to enact prohibition amendments. Two important groups were formed during this period. The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was formed in 1874. The Anti-Saloon League which began in Ohio was formed in 1893, uniting activists from different religious groups. The league, rooted in Protestant churches, envisioned nationwide prohibition. Rather than condemn all drinking, the group focused attention on the saloon which was considered the ultimate symbol of public vice. The league also concentrated on campaigns for the right of individual communities to choose whether to close their saloons. In 1907, Georgia and Alabama were the first states to go dry followed by Oklahoma, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee in the following years. In 1913, Congress passed the Webb–Kenyon Act, which forbade the transport of liquor into dry states.

By 1917, two-thirds of the states had some form of prohibition laws and roughly three-quarters of the population lived in dry areas. In 1913, the Anti-Saloon League first publicly appealed for a prohibition amendment. They preferred a constitutional amendment over a federal statute because although harder to achieve, they felt it would be harder to change. As the United States entered World War I, the Conscription Act banned the sale of liquor near military bases. In August 1917, the Lever Food and Fuel Control Act banned production of distilled spirits for the duration of the war. The War Prohibition Act, November 1918, forbade the manufacture and sale of intoxicating beverages (more than 2.75% alcohol content) until the end of demobilization.

The drys worked energetically to secure two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress and the support of three-quarters of the states needed for an amendment to the federal constitution. Thirty-six states were needed, and organizations were set up at all 48 states to seek ratification. In late 1917, Congress passed the Eighteenth Amendment; it was ratified in 1919 and took effect in January 1920. It prohibited the manufacturing, sale or transport of intoxicating beverages within the United States, as well as import and export. The Volstead Act, 1919, defined intoxicating as having alcohol content greater than 0.5% and established the procedures for federal enforcement of the Act. The states were at liberty to enforce prohibition or not, and most did not try.

Consumer demand, however, led to a variety of illegal sources for alcohol, especially illegal distilleries and smuggling from Canada and other countries. It is difficult to determine the level of compliance, and although the media at the time portrayed the law as highly ineffective, even if it did not eradicate the use of alcohol, it certainly decreased alcohol consumption during the period. The Eighteenth Amendment was repealed in 1933, with the passage of the Twenty-First Amendment, thanks to a well-organized repeal campaign led by Catholics (who stressed personal liberty) and businessmen (who stressed the lost tax revenue).

Prohibition also brought a rise to organized crime, which was able to profit off the sales of illegal alcohol. Al Capone was one of the most well-known criminals to partake in illegal alcohol sales. There was a huge demand for alcohol, but most business owners were unwilling to risk getting involved in the transportation of alcohol. The business owners did however have little issue with selling the alcohol that the criminals like Capone provided.

Organized crime was able to be successful due to their willingness to use intimidation and violence to carry out their illicit enterprises. During prohibition, the mafia was able to grow their stronghold on illegal activities throughout the United States. This illegal behavior began almost in conjunction with prohibition being voted into law. Within the first hours of prohibition, the police in Chicago reported the theft of medicinal liquor. The prohibition era gangsters outlasted the law and used it as a starting point to launch their criminal enterprises.

===Education===

The reform of public schools was one of the prime concerns of the middle class during this period. The number of schools in the nation increased dramatically. The voice of the Progressive Education Movement in America was John Dewey, a professor at the University of Chicago (1896–1904) and Teachers College, Columbia University (1904-1930). He argued, in books such as &quot;The Child and the Curriculum&quot; and &quot;Schools of Tomorrow&quot;, that, in addition to teaching academic content, schools should teach everyday skills and promote democratic participation. A higher level of education also gained popularity. By 1930, 12% of 18- to 21-year-olds were attending college, compared to 3% in 1890.

====Women in home economics====

A new field of study, the art and science of homemaking, emerged in an effort to feminize women&#x27;s education in the United States. Home economics emerged at the end of the nineteenth century in response to the many changes occurring both at the level of material culture and practices and in the more abstract realm of gender ideology and thinking about the home. As the industrial revolution took hold of the American economy and as mass production, alienation, and urbanization appeared to be unstoppable trends, Americans looked for solutions that could soften the effects of change without slowing down the engines of progress. 

Advocates argued that homemaking, as a profession, required education and training for the development of an efficient and systematic domestic practice. The curriculum aimed to cover a variety of topics, including teaching a standardized ways of gardening, child-rearing, cooking, cleaning, performing household maintenance, and doctoring. Such scientific management applied to the domestic sphere was presented as a solution to the dilemma black middle-class women faced in terms of searching for meaning and fulfillment in their role of housekeeping. The feminist perspective, by pushing for this type of education, intended to explain that women had separate but equally important responsibilities in life with men that required proper training.

====Child labor and schooling====

There was a concern towards working class children being taken out of school to be put straight to work. Progressives around the country put up campaigns to push for an improvement in public education and to make education mandatory. There were some less successful attempts in the South, where educational levels were far lower. The Southern Education Board came together to publicize the importance of reform. However, many rejected the reform. Farmers and workers relied heavily on their children to work and help the family&#x27;s income. Immigrants were not for reform either, fearing that such a thing would Americanize their children.

Enrollment for children (age 5 to 19) in school rose from 51 percent to 59 between 1900 and 1909. Enrollment in public secondary school went from 519,000 to 841,000. School funds and the term of public schools also grew.

===Medicine and law===
The &quot;Flexner Report&quot; of 1910, sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation, professionalized American medicine by discarding the scores of local small medical schools and focusing national funds, resources, and prestige on larger, professionalized medical schools associated with universities. Prominent leaders included the Mayo Brothers whose Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, became world-famous for innovative surgery.

In the legal profession, the American Bar Association set up in 1900 the Association of American Law Schools (AALS). It established national standards for law schools, which led to the replacement of the old system of young men studying law privately with established lawyers by the new system of accredited law schools associated with universities.

===Social sciences===
Progressive scholars, based at the emerging research universities such as Harvard, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Chicago, Michigan, Wisconsin, and California, worked to modernize their disciplines. The heyday of the amateur expert gave way to the research professor who published in the new scholarly journals and presses. Their explicit goal was to professionalize and make &quot;scientific&quot; the social sciences, especially history, economics, and political science. Professionalization meant creating new career tracks in the universities, with hiring and promotion dependent on meeting international models of scholarship.

===Military===
The Commission on Training Camp Activities sought to &quot;socialize and Americanize&quot; troops, especially native-born and foreign-born men, to meet the expected level of societal standards and integrate them into American culture. The ideology of the Commission was characterized by that of the Progressive Era, which strived against prostitution, alcoholism, social diseases, and poor sanitary conditions in major cities. The CTCA attempted to eradicate these problems from military training camps.

===Eugenics===
Some progressives sponsored eugenics as a solution to excessively large or underperforming families, hoping that birth control would enable parents to focus their resources on fewer, better children. Progressive leaders like Herbert Croly and Walter Lippmann indicated their classically liberal concern over the danger posed to the individual by the practice of eugenics. The Catholics strongly opposed birth control proposals such as eugenics.

==Decline==
In the 1940s typically historians saw the Progressive Era as a prelude to the New Deal and dated it from 1901 (when Roosevelt became president) to the start of World War I in 1914 or 1917. Historians have moved back in time emphasizing the Progressive reformers at the municipal and state levels in the 1890s.

===End of the Progressive Era===
The Progressive political crusades were overshadowed in 1919 by violent confrontations with Bolsheviks (Communists), anarchists and violent strikes. The crusading element of progressivism thus largely ended, apart from prohibition, although business-oriented efficiency efforts continued. In 1919, Theodore Roosevelt died and Wilson&#x27;s health collapsed, leaving a void in top leadership. The major new face was Herbert Hoover.

Much less settled is the question of when the era ended. Some historians who emphasize civil liberties decry their suppression during 1917–1919 and do not consider the war as rooted in Progressive policy. A strong anti-war movement headed by noted Progressives including Jane Addams, was suppressed by the Preparedness Movement and Wilson&#x27;s 1916 re-election, a victory largely enabled by his campaign slogan, &quot;He kept us out of the war.&quot; The slogan was no longer accurate by April 6 of the following year, when Wilson surprised much of the Progressive base that twice elected him and asked a joint session of Congress to declare war on Germany. The Senate voted 82–6 in favor; the House agreed, 373–50. Some historians see the so-called &quot;war to end all wars&quot; as a globalized expression of the American Progressive movement, with Wilson&#x27;s support for a League of Nations as its climax.

The politics of the 1920s was unfriendly toward the labor unions and liberal crusaders against business, so many if not most historians who emphasize those themes write off the decade. Urban cosmopolitan scholars recoiled at the moralism of prohibition, the intolerance of the nativists and the KKK, and on those grounds denounced the era. Richard Hofstadter, for example, in 1955 wrote that prohibition, &quot;was a pseudo-reform, a pinched, parochial substitute for reform&quot; that &quot;was carried about America by the rural–evangelical virus&quot;. However, as Arthur S. Link emphasized, the Progressives did not simply roll over and play dead. Link&#x27;s argument for continuity through the 1920s stimulated a historiography that found Progressivism to be a potent force. Palmer, pointing to leaders like George Norris, says, &quot;It is worth noting that progressivism, while temporarily losing the political initiative, remained popular in many western states and made its presence felt in Washington during both the Harding and Coolidge presidencies.&quot; Gerster and Cords argue that, &quot;Since progressivism was a &#x27;spirit&#x27; or an &#x27;enthusiasm&#x27; rather than an easily definable force with common goals, it seems more accurate to argue that it produced a climate for reform which lasted well into the 1920s, if not beyond.&quot; Some social historians have posited that the KKK may in fact fit into the Progressive agenda, if Klansmen are portrayed as &quot;ordinary white Protestants&quot; primarily interested in purification of the system, which had long been a core Progressive goal.

<text>Yala (යාල) National Park is the most visited and second largest national park in Sri Lanka, bordering the Indian Ocean. The park consists of five blocks, three of which are now open to the public. There are also two adjoining parks, Kumana National Park or &#x27;Yala East&#x27; and Lunugamvehera National Park. The blocks have individual names, such as Palatupana (Block 1). It is situated in the southeastern region of the country, in the Southern Province and Uva Province. The park covers and is located about from Colombo. Yala was designated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, along with Wilpattu, designated in 1938, as the first two designated national parks in Sri Lanka. The park is best known for its variety of wildlife and is important conservation of Sri Lankan elephants, Sri Lankan leopards and aquatic birds.

There are six national parks and three wildlife sanctuaries in the vicinity of Yala. Among the largest is Lunugamvehera National Park. The park is situated in the dry semi-arid climatic region and rain is received mainly during the northeast monsoon. Yala hosts a variety of ecosystems ranging from moist monsoon forests to freshwater and marine wetlands. It is one of the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Yala harbors 215 bird species including six endemic species of Sri Lanka. The number of mammals that has been recorded from the park is 44, and it has one of the highest leopard densities in the world.

The area around Yala has hosted several ancient civilizations. Two important Buddhist pilgrim sites, Sithulpahuwa and Magul Vihara, are situated within the park. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused severe damage on the Yala National Park and 250 people died in its vicinity. The number of visitors has been on the rise since 2009, after the security situation in the park improved.

== History ==
In 1560 Spanish cartographer Cipriano Sánchez noted Yala in his map &quot;is abandoned for 300 years due to insalubrious conditions.&quot; Chief Justice Sir Alexander Johnston wrote a detailed account on Yala in 1806 after travelling from Trincomalee to Hambantota. On March 23, 1900, the government proclaimed Yala and Wilpattu reserves under the Forest Ordinance. Initially the extent of the reserve was between the Menik and Kumbukkan Rivers. At that time the reserve did not bear the name Yala. The Game Protection Society (now the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society) was instrumental in establishing the reserve. The forest area between Palatupana and Yala was declared a hunting site reserved only for the resident sportsmen. Henry Engelbrecht was appointed as the first park warden.
On 1 March 1938, Yala became a national park when the Flora and Fauna Protection Ordinance was passed into law by D. S. Senanayake, the minister of agriculture. The park consists of five blocks. Subsequently, four other blocks were incorporated to the park. There are six national parks and three wildlife sanctuaries in the vicinity of Yala. Kumana National Park, Yala Strict Nature Reserve and Kataragama, Katagamuwa, and Nimalawa sanctuaries are continuous with the park.

== Physical features ==
The Yala area is mostly composed of metamorphic rock belonging to the Precambrian era and classified into two series, Vijayan series and Highland series. Reddish brown soil and low humic grey soil are prominent among six soil types. Yala is situated in the lowest peneplain of Sri Lanka, which extends from Trincomalee to Hambantota. Topographically the area is a flat and mildly undulating plain that runs to the coast with elevation is close to the coast while rising in the interior to . The national park is situated in the dry semi-arid climatic region and rain is received mainly during the northeast monsoon. The mean annual rainfall ranges between while the mean temperature ranges between in January to in April. It is windier in Yala, during the southwest monsoon compared to the wind during the northeast monsoon with wind speeds from to .

Water is abundant after the northeast monsoon, but during the dry season surface water becomes an important factor. The bodies of surface water appear in the forms of streams, tanks, waterholes, rock pools, and lagoons. Waterholes occur in low lying places while rock pools of varying size are capable of containing water year-round, and are hence an important source of water for elephants. For many water birds and water buffaloes natural waterholes are ideal habitats. Such reservoirs are largely concentrated to the Block I followed by Block II. Several tanks are there including, Maha Seelawa, Buthawa, Uraniya, and Pilinnawa tanks. Many rivers and streams flow in a southeasterly direction, originating in the highlands of adjacent Uva and central hills. Kumbukkan Oya in the east and Menik River and its tributaries in the west flow across the park, and provide an important water source in the dry season to wild animals of the park. Normally the streams of the park are dry during the drought season. These rivers and streams exhibit a degree of runoff fluctuations between wet and dry seasons. Kumbukkan Oya discharges seven times as much water in the rainy season than in the dry season. A number of lagoons are situated along the coast line of the park. There are several routes to get to Yala from Colombo, while the route via Ratnapura and Tissamaharama is the shortest with .

== Impact of the 2004 tsunami ==
Yala lay in the direct path of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which impacted Sri Lanka 90 minutes after its generation. The tsunami caused severe but localized damage on the park, with around 250 people being killed. The tsunami wave was reported to be high. The tsunami waves reached inland only through the river-mouth gaps in the coastal dunes. Inundation distances from ranged up to . The main habitats affected are scrub forest and grasslands. About of grassland, forest, and wetland were directly affected by the tsunami. The satellite images revealed that mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) range from 0.245 to 0.772 in the Block I and II. After the disaster the NDVI value fell dramatically to 0.2111. Around 60% of the area along the coastline has changed. The damage was worse closer to the sea. The movement patterns of two radio collared elephants were analyzed. The study found out that their movements were consistent with behaviour prompted by immediate cues generated by the tsunami waves rather than a response to a &quot;sixth sense&quot;.

== Flora ==
Yala National Park has a variety of ecosystems including moist monsoon forests, dry monsoon forests, semi deciduous forests, thorn forests, grasslands, marshes, marine wetlands, and sandy beaches. The area under forest cover mainly consists of Block I and rangelands of open parkland (&quot;pelessa&quot; grasslands) including some extensive grasslands. The forest area is restricted to around the Menik River while rangelands are found towards the sea side. Other habitat types of the Block I are tanks and water holes, lagoons and mangroves and chena lands. The mangrove vegetation in the Buthuwa lagoon is largely &quot;Rhizophora mucronata&quot; while &quot;Avicennia&quot; spp. and &quot;Aegiceras&quot; spp. are less abundant. The vegetation of Block II is similar to those of Block I, and Yalawela, once a fertile paddy field, represents &quot;pitiya&quot; grasslands. The mangroves of Block II occur around the estuary of Menik River, which extend to . The common mangrove plants are &quot;Rhizophora mucronata&quot;, &quot;Sonneratia caseolaris&quot;, &quot;Avicennia&quot; spp., and &quot;Aegiceras corniculatum&quot;. The lagoons of Pilinnawa, Mahapothana, and Pahalapothana are also located in this block. The other common mangrove species are &quot;Acanthus ilicifolius&quot;, &quot;Excoecaria agallocha&quot;, and &quot;Lumnitzera racemosa&quot;. In the bare sand &quot;Crinum zeylanicum&quot; is found.

In the Blocks III, IV, and V, forests are more widespread. The canopy of the forest mainly contains &quot;Drypetes sepiaria&quot; and &quot;Manilkara hexandra&quot; plant species. The &quot;Pitiya&quot; grasslands are important for grazing animals. &quot;Cynodon barberi&quot; is the common grass in &quot;pitiya&quot; grasslands while &quot;Zoysia matrella&quot; becomes dominant near the beach. Among 300 odd floral species are &quot;Manilkara hexandra&quot;, &quot;Drypetes sepiaria&quot;, Ceylon satinwood, &quot;Terminalia arjuna&quot;, limonia, &quot;Berrya cordifolia&quot;, &quot;Randia dumetorum&quot;, &quot;Pleurostylia opposita&quot;, &quot;Gymnema sylvestre&quot;, bell mimosa, neem, banyan, toothbrush tree, &quot;Schleichera oleosa&quot;, &quot;Vitex pinnata&quot;, Indian blackberry, &quot;Gmelina asiatica&quot;, &quot;Carissa spinarum&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia antiquorum&quot;, and &quot;Acacia eburnea&quot;. In the seasonally flooded areas of Block II, a wild species of rice is found. &quot;Glenniea unijuga&quot; is an endemic plant species found around the wetlands of the park. &quot;Munronia pumila&quot;, &quot;Salacia reticulata&quot;, and &quot;Asparagus racemosus&quot; are some medicinal plants.

== Fauna ==

=== Birds ===
Yala is one of the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 bird species of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed bee-eater and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey heron, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders &quot;Tringa&quot; spp., and small waders &quot;Charadrius&quot; spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that can be seen in the park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, Eurasian whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred buttonquail, Indian peafowl, black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species. Crested serpent eagle and white-bellied sea eagle are the raptors of the park. The forest birds are orange-breasted green pigeon, hornbills, Old World flycatchers, Indian paradise flycatcher, Asian barbets, and orioles.

=== Mammals ===

Including Sri Lankan elephant, 44 species of mammals are resident in Yala National Park, and it has one of the highest leopard densities in the world. 25 individual leopards are estimated to roam in Block I. The elephant herd of Yala contains 300–350 individuals. The Sri Lankan sloth bear, leopard, elephant, and wild water buffalo are all threatened mammals that Yala harbours. Although water buffaloes are indigenous to Sri Lanka, most populations contain genes of the domestic stock or have descended from feral populations. Toque macaque, golden palm civet, red slender loris, and fishing cat are among the other mammals that can be seen in Yala. The elephant population of the park varies seasonally.

=== Reptiles ===
The reptile fauna recorded from the park is 47 and six of them are endemic. Sri Lankan krait, Boulenger&#x27;s keelback, Sri Lankan flying snake, painted-lip lizard, Wiegmann&#x27;s agama, and Bahir&#x27;s fan-throated lizard are the endemic species. The coastal line of the park is visited by the all five globally endangered sea turtles (leatherback turtle, olive ridley, loggerhead sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, and green turtle) that visit Sri Lanka. The two breeding crocodile species of Sri Lanka, mugger crocodile and saltwater crocodile, inhabit the park. The Indian cobra and Russell&#x27;s viper are among the other reptiles.

=== Amphibians ===
There are 18 amphibian species that have been recorded from Yala, while &quot;Bufo atukoralei&quot; and &quot;Adenomus kelaartii&quot; are endemic to Sri Lanka.

=== Fish ===
In the water courses of Yala, 21 freshwater fish are found. The fish population in the perennial reservoirs contain mostly exotic food fish Mozambique tilapia. The stone sucker and &quot;Esomus thermoicos&quot; are endemic among other species. The blackspot barb, olive barb, orange chromide and common spiny loach are the common fish species.

=== Invertebrates ===
Crabs and prawns include the fauna in the lagoons of the park.

A variety of butterfly species is found here. The common bluebottle, common lime butterfly, crimson rose, common Jezebel, and common Mormon are the common species.

== Cultural importance ==
Yala had been a center of past civilisations. King Ravana, the mythical Hindu anti-hero is believed to have established his kingdom here with Ravana Kotte, now submerged in the sea, as its boundary. Seafaring traders brought Indo-Aryan civilisation with them, as Yala is situated in their trading route. A large number of ancient although disrepaired tanks are the evidence of a rich hydraulic and agricultural civilisation dating back to 5th century BC. Situlpahuwa, which was the home for 12,000 arahants, is situated within the park area along with Magul Vihara, which built in 87 BC and Akasa Chaitiya, which constructed in 2nd century BC. Agriculture flourished in area during the period of Ruhuna Kingdom. According to &quot;Mahavamsa&quot;, the Kingdom of Ruhuna began to decline by the end of the 13th century AD. During the colonial period Yala became a popular hunting ground. Yala is annually visited by 400,000 pilgrims.

== Threats and conservation ==
Poaching, gem-mining, logging, encroachment by agriculture, and free-roaming domestic livestock are the main threats to the park. Three wardens have been killed in clashes with poachers. Gems are mined along the Menik River and holes created by gem mining, which extend up to , can be seen along the Kumbukkan Oya. In Blocks III and IV, the encroachment is severe as chena cultivation and burning, to provide grazing in the dry season, collides with the boundary. A large grove of &quot;Sonneratia caseolaris&quot; is faced with forest dieback in the Menik River&#x27;s estuary. Cultivation of tobacco, noise and air pollutions caused by uncontrolled tourism are the other conservation issues. The growth of invasive alien species such as &quot;Lantana camara&quot;, &quot;Opuntia dillenii&quot;, &quot;Chromolaena odorata&quot; is threatening the native plants.

Deep within the forest, Ganja is cultivated in cleared areas. The wildlife is poached and disturbed by the fishermen at Patanangala. The turtles are caught in fishing nets and the fishermen also litter the beach with debris. They have also set traps inland and dig up turtle nests. In the absence of hand-weeding, which was practiced until the 1950s, the transformation of interior grasslands to scrub jungle is unavoidable. The tourism has created problems in the past, such as vehicles harassing wild animals. The issue is most severe in Sithulpahuwa where thousands of pilgrims visit, leading to a great degree of commercialisation. Department of Wildlife Conservation has taken some conservation measures such as management of grazing lands, conservation of small water ponds, and eradication of invasive alien species. A long electric fence was erected to prevent elephants from moving into nearby villages.

== Tourism ==
The Yala National Park is the most visited park in Sri Lanka. In 2002 around 156,867 tourists visited the park. Foreigners, especially Europeans, account for 30% of total visitors. Block I is the main area for visits. Block III (main gate in Galge area, on Buttala-Kataragama Road) and the adjoining Kumana Park or &#x27;Yala East&#x27; (main gate at Okanda, on the east coast not far from Pottuvil) however are becoming popular in their own right too.

Note that the Situlpahuwa pilgrimage site, geographically in Block III, has kind of an &#x27;enclave&#x27; status and is accessible FOC through separate roads from Tissa and Kataragama. Most of the visitors stated that reasons for their visit is to see wild animals, and elephant is the most preferred animal. The visitors like to see bears, leopards, birds as well. In 2000 the income from visitors including lodge fees was approximately 468,629. Due to security conditions revenue was lost. The Yala National Park has been susceptible to terrorist attacks. On 17 October 2007 a group of LTTE cadres attacked an army detachment in Thalgasmankada in the park. The attack killed six army soldiers and another was caught up in a landmine explosion. On 11 July 2008 four people died in an attack launched by the LTTE. The cadres opened fire at a bus carrying pilgrims to Kataragama. Since the end of the civil war, May 2009, no violence has occurred in Yala area also and it is fully safe for visitors; this was also the main factor in opening blocks III and V for tourists.

From January to June in 2008, 9,078 local tourists and 7,532 foreigners have visited Yala. For the same period of time in 2009 the arrivals have risen to 18,031 locals and foreigners to 10,439. Accordingly, the revenue increased to Rs. 27 million (235,000) in 2009 from Rs. 16.6 million (154,000) in 2008. The visitors are allowed to see the wild animals from 5.30 am to 6.30 pm. Due to droughts the park used to be closed to tourists from 1 September, to 15 October annually; however in 2009 and 2010 the closure was skipped and lakes filled with water bowsers for drinking water for the animals, a future strategy on drought handling is not yet clear.

<text>The Principality of Ruhuna (Sinhala: , ), also referred to as the Kingdom of Ruhuna, is a region of present-day Southern and Eastern Sri Lanka. It was the center of a flourishing civilisation and the cultural and economic centres of ancient Sri Lanka. Magama, Tissamaharama and Mahanagakula (now called as Ambalantota) were established here.

The kingdom of Ruhuna was an important state in Sinhalese history as it was known for several rebellions against the superior states in Rajarata. The principality was defeated with its last de facto Queen Sugala been captured and executed by the invading army of Parakramabahu I. Following its annexing by Parakramabahu, the rebellions that arose were suppressed.

== Name ==
Following the arrival of Princess Buddhakachchana, six of her brothers came to Sri Lanka and settled in different parts of the island. One of the brothers, Rohana, settled in the area between Kumbukkan Oya and Deeghawapi. His settlement was named Rohana.

== History ==
===Founding===
According to the Pali chronicles, Ruhuna was founded around 200 BC by Prince Mahanaga, brother to Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura, after a personal dispute. This region played a vital role in building the nation as well in the establishment of Buddhist culture.

===Significance===

The kings of Anuradhapura and the Chola kingdom during the reign over a majority of the country, generally fought against the forces of Ruhuna.

Notable Ruhunan militants include: Vijayabahu I, whose armies defeated several Chola generals; and Manabharana II, whose army once conquered Polonnaruwa. The resistances that arose from Ruhuna were generally victorious against the Rajarata kingdom.

===Conquest===
After Parakramabahu I conquered the kingdom of Rajarata, defeating its king Gajabahu II, he dispatched a force to Ruhuna. The people and army of Ruhuna generally opposed this and established a force against the invaders. While the Ruhunans were able to defeat a prominent general of Parakramabahu&#x27;s army named Rakkha, they were defeated and their queen was executed.

==Area==
The area identified with Ruhuna in ancient times is mainly the Southern Province, a large part of the Uva Province and small parts of Sabaragamuwa and Eastern Provinces.

<text>The iiwi (pronounced , &quot;ee-EE-vee&quot;) (Drepanis coccinea) or scarlet honeycreeper is a species of Hawaiian honeycreeper. The iiwi is a highly recognizable symbol of Hawaii. 

== Etymology ==
Linguists derive the Hawaiian language word &quot;iiwi&quot; from Proto-Nuclear-Polynesian &quot;*kiwi&quot;, which in central Polynesia refers to the bristle-thighed curlew (&quot;Numenius tahitiensis&quot;), a migratory bird. The long decurved bill of the curlew somewhat resembles that of the iiwi.

== Description ==

The adult iiwi is mostly scarlet, with black wings and tail and a long, curved, salmon-colored bill used primarily for drinking nectar. The contrast of the red and black plumage with surrounding green foliage makes the iiwi one of Hawaii&#x27;s most easily seen native birds. Younger birds have golden plumage with more spots and ivory bills and were mistaken for a different species by early naturalists. Observations of young birds moulting into adult plumage resolved this confusion.

Along with the Hawaiʻi Mamo, iiwi were used in the feather trade. The iiwi&#x27;s feathers were highly prized by Hawaiian &quot;alii&quot; (nobility) for use in decorating &quot;ahuula&quot; (feather cloaks) and &quot;mahiole&quot; (feathered helmets), and such uses gave the species its original scientific name: &quot;Vestiaria&quot;, which comes from the Latin for &quot;clothing&quot;, and &quot;coccinea&quot; meaning &quot;scarlet-colored&quot;. (In 2015 the IOC World Bird List moved the iiwi from genus &quot;Vestiaria&quot; to &quot;Drepanis&quot; because of the close relationship between the iiwi and the two species of mamo; &quot;Drepanis&quot; comes from the Greek for sickle, a reference to the shape of the beak.)

The bird is often mentioned in Hawaiian folklore. The Hawaiian song &quot;Sweet Lei Mamo&quot; includes the line &quot;The iiwi bird, too, is a friend&quot;.

===Songs===
The iiwiʻs peculiar song consists of a couple of whistles, the sound of balls dropping in water, the rubbing of balloons together, and the squeaking of a rusty hinge.

===Diet===
The long bill of the iiwi assists it to extract nectar from the flowers of the Hawaiian lobelioids, which have decurved corollas. Starting in 1902 the lobelioid population declined dramatically, and the iiwi shifted to nectar from the blossoms of ōhia lehua (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;) trees. Iiwi also eat small arthropods.

===Breeding===

In the early winter in January to June, the birds pair off and mate as the ōhia plants reach their flowering maximum. The female lays two to three eggs in a small cup shaped nest made from tree fibers, petals, and down feathers. These bluish eggs hatch in fourteen days. The chicks are yellowish-green marked with brownish-orange. The chicks fledge in 24 days and soon attain adult plumage.

===Habitat and Distribution===
The largest populations of iiwi inhabit Hawaii Island, followed by Maui with the greatest numbers in East Maui, and fewer than 1% of iiwi remain on Kauai. There may be remnant populations on Molokai and Oahu; very few iiwi have been recorded on either island since the 1990s. They are no longer present on Lānai. Overall, ninety percent of the iiwi population is confined to a narrow band of forest on East Maui and the windward slopes of the island of Hawaii, between 4,265 and 6,234 feet (1,300 and 1,900 meters) in elevation. They are most abundant in mesic to wet forests at higher elevations.

These birds are altitudinal migrants; they follow the progress of flowers as they develop at increasing altitudes throughout the year. It has also been noted that birds on Mauna Kea, Hawaii Island, likely make daily trips from lower elevations to feed on nectar. Seeking food at low elevation exposes them to low elevation disease organisms and high mortality. It has been theorized that the iiwi can migrate between islands and it may be why the bird has not gone extinct on smaller islands such as Molokai. Altitudinal migration complicates population assessment.

== Threats and Conservation ==
Although &#x27;I&#x27;iwi are still relatively common in Hawaii, they have lost over 90% of their range and are being considered to be listed on the endangered species act. Iiwi was formerly classified as a near threatened species by the IUCN, but recent research has proven that it is rarer than previously believed. Consequently, it was uplisted to vulnerable status in 2008. The species was listed as threatened by the United States Department of the Interior on 20 October 2017.

=== Avian Malaria ===
Iiwi are listed as a threatened species because of small and declining populations in some of its range and its susceptibility to fowlpox and avian malaria. Avian malaria (&quot;Plasmodium relictum&quot;) is an introduced disease that is spread by mosquitoes. Iiwi generally survive at higher elevations where temperatures are too cool for mosquitoes. Many disease-susceptible endemic birds, including iiwi and kiwikiu, became rare to absent at lower elevations, even in relatively intact native forest. Avian malaria has been identified as the primary driver of declines in abundance and distribution of iiwi observed since 1900. They are one of the most susceptible Hawaiian honeycreepers, with more than 75% exposure to the bird after being bitten by a single mosquito and with 90% overall mortality. One of the main reasons the &#x27;I&#x27;iwi get exposed to malaria is because the birds move down to lower elevations post breeding season in order to track more food from ˋŌhiˋa trees and were shown to be exposed to malaria much more often than those birds who were more sedentary and stayed in higher elevation zones. In another study, they were also shown to have the longest movement patterns out of any of three other native Hawaiian birds, which may also be spreading avian malaria amongst the &#x27;I&#x27;iwi. In middle elevations, there is a growing number of mosquitoes in the fall that facilitate disease transmission and affect the birds at higher elevations that travel to lower elevations to forage for food. ‘I’iwi usually reside at high enough elevations that they are not exposed to the disease. However, with climate change, they are expected to be exposed to the disease even more as the climate warms and the disease is able to develop in mosquitoes at higher altitudes where the ‘I’iwi used to be somewhat safe. As for the current abundance of &#x27;I&#x27;iwi in these areas, there were more &#x27;I&#x27;iwi found above 1350 m in altitude when compared to a survey done in 1979. There were also no &#x27;I&#x27;iwi found in mid-elevations, while back in 1979, 37% of the &#x27;I&#x27;iwi found were located here, which gives further evidence that they are being pushed into higher elevations because of global warming. For these reasons, it has been projected that the &#x27;I&#x27;iwi may be on the verge of extinction by 2100. There is a movement to begin an official eradication of mosquitos in Hawaii, as there are no native species on the islands, and their removal would not hurt the food web. Each week, 250,000 male mosquitoes who cannot produce offspring with local female mosquitoes are released from helicopters to suppress the mosquito population.

=== Land Conservation and ˋŌhiˋa Death ===
Iiwi habitat has been reduced and fragmented through various types of land development, including clearing native forest for food crops and grazing. Invasive plants also outcompete and displace native plants that iiwi use for foraging and nesting. Invasive animals impact iiwi in a variety of ways, for example feral ungulates may trample native plants and spread nonnative plants and invasive seeds, further degrading habitat. Feral pigs often create by knocking over vegetation and hollowing out areas that fill with rain water. These have the potential to become incubator sites for mosquito larvae, which in turn spread avian malaria.

Another problem aiding the extinction of the &#x27;I&#x27;iwi is the death of the ˋŌhiˋa tree. The ˋŌhiˋa tree is known to act as shelter for various rare and endangered species and be a food source for many birds on the island, making it one of the most important sources of nectar for Hawaiian Honeycreepers and the most important tree in regards to ecology in Hawaii. However, in recent years many of the trees have begun to die out due to a disease called Ceratocystis Wilt, also called Rapid ˋŌhiˋa Death, which causes rapid death of the leaves on a single branch that spreads to the rest of the tree incredibly quickly. There has been extensive death of these trees in untouched part of the forest, which has further contributed to the problem of the &#x27;I&#x27;iwi having to leave higher elevations to find food and being exposed to malaria.

=== Mitigating Threats and Conservation Issues ===
One way that has been studied to help mitigate the issue of &#x27;I&#x27;iwi and avian malaria is through gene editing to make &#x27;I&#x27;iwi that are resistant to malaria. However, a very large number of gene edited &#x27;I&#x27;iwi would have to be released before the year 2050 in order for this strategy to work, which would be extremely expensive. There have also been various other solutions proposed, like gene edited mosquitoes, feral pig control in order to reduce habitats for mosquito larvae, and &#x27;I&#x27;iwi predator control in order to increase the population. Other solutions include getting rid of invasive species that produce nectar and increasing native flowering plants in higher elevations so that the &#x27;I&#x27;iwi do not have to go into the lower elevation, mosquito infested areas to forage for food.

Organizations throughout the islands have established nature reserves to protect native habitat. Fencing off sections of land to keep out feral ungulates, especially pigs, goats and axis deer enables native plants to recover from overgrazing and ungulate damage and helps restore native bird habitat. In recent years another threat has put native bird habitat at risk. Conservation groups are diligently working to reduce the risk of spreading a disease called Rapid ˋŌhiˋa Death (ROD). This disease along with ōhia dieback and ōhia rust could lead to a rapid decline in ōhia forests, an important nectar source for iiwi.

==In popular culture==
A feather of the i&#x27;i&#x27;wi plays a prominrnt part In &quot;The Case of the Lover&#x27;s Gamble&quot; episode of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (season 8, episode 20, first broadcast February 18, 1965).

<text>BuyMusic was a paid online music store run by Buy.com.

==History==
The store was launched in July 2003 with 300,000 tracks available and was designed to compete with iTunes Music Store because at the time of launch, Apple&#x27;s store was limited to Macintosh users, and BuyMusic was the first to offer paid downloads to non-Mac users. Unlike iTunes Music Store, the price of each song ranges from 80¢ to US$1.99. Reportedly in 2003, the site claimed to be &quot;The World’s Largest Download Music Store.&quot; 

The site used to have extreme limitations on what users could browse. It would not allow anyone not using Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater to even view the songs available. Even users that met the stated requirements could encounter trouble—clicking the main &quot;click here&quot; link routinely crashed some user&#x27;s IE 5.5 browsers. Before the spring 2004 integration with its parent site, Buy.com, users that did not meet the stated requirements couldn&#x27;t even access static content such as press releases. Since the integration, all users can access all of Buy.com.

The site has provided no statistics regarding the number of customers and downloads, yet Scott Blum, founder and CEO of BuyMusic, noted &quot;We&#x27;re nowhere near Apple&#x27;s iTunes Music Store numbers.&quot; in a December 2003 interview.

Though the download service&#x27;s closure was never officially announced, it had quietly disappeared by December 2009, if not before; Buy.com&#x27;s press releases stopped mentioning it sometime in 2007. The buymusic.com URL formerly redirected to Buy.com&#x27;s physical CD store, and later redirects to Rakuten but now times out.

<text>A plague doctor was a physician who treated victims of bubonic plague during epidemics in 17th-century Europe. These physicians were hired by cities to treat infected patients regardless of income, especially the poor, who could not afford to pay.

Plague doctors had a mixed reputation, with some citizens seeing their presence as a warning to leave the area or that death was near. Some plague doctors were said to charge patients and their families additional fees for special treatments or false cures. In many cases, these doctors were not experienced or trained physicians or surgeons, instead being volunteers, second-rate doctors, or young doctors just starting a career. Plague doctors rarely cured patients, instead serving to record death tolls and the number of infected people for demographic purposes.

In France and the Netherlands, plague doctors often lacked medical training and were referred to as &quot;empirics&quot;. Plague doctors were known as municipal or &quot;community plague doctors&quot;, whereas &quot;general practitioners&quot; were separate doctors and both might be in the same European city or town at the same time.

==History==
An early reference to plague doctors wearing masks is in 1373 when Johannes Jacobi recommends the use of masks, but offers no physical description of the masks themselves. According to Michel Tibayrenc&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Infectious Diseases&quot;, the first mention of the iconic plague doctor is found during the 1619 plague outbreak in Paris, in a biography of royal physician Charles de Lorme, serving King Louis XIII of France at the time. After De Lorme, German engraver Gerhart Altzenbach published a famous illustration in 1656, which publisher Paulus Fürst&#x27;s iconic (1656) is based upon. In this satirical work, Fürst describes how the doctor does nothing but terrify people and take money from the dead and dying.

The city of Orvieto hired Matteo fu Angelo as a plague doctor in 1348 for four times at a normal doctor&#x27;s rate of 50 florins per year. Pope Clement VI hired several extra plague doctors during the Black Death plague to tend to the sick people of Avignon. Of eighteen doctors in Venice, only one was left by 1348: five had died of the plague, and twelve were missing and may have fled.

==Methods and tasks==
Plague doctors practiced bloodletting and other remedies such as putting frogs or leeches on the buboes to &quot;rebalance the humors.&quot; A plague doctor&#x27;s principal task, besides treating people with the plague, was to compile public records of plague deaths.

In certain European cities like Florence and Perugia, plague doctors were requested to do autopsies to help determine the cause of death and how the plague affected the people. Plague doctors also sometimes took patients&#x27; last will and testament during times of plague epidemics, and gave advice to their patients about their conduct before death. This advice varied depending on the patient, and after the Middle Ages, the nature of the relationship between doctor and patient was governed by an increasingly complex ethical code.

==Costume==

Some plague doctors wore a special costume consisting of an ankle-length overcoat and a bird-like beak mask. As an attempt to purify the air they breathed (it was believed that good smells would &#x27;cancel out&#x27; the diseases, and people would often walk around with a flower under their nose), the wearer would fill the mask with herbs and spices (commonly lavender). The plague doctors would also wear gloves, boots, a wide-brimmed hat, a linen hood, and an outer over-clothing garment. However, the costume was not worn by all medieval and early modern physicians studying and treating plague patients.

The exact origins of the plague costumes are unclear but have been dated back to Italy and France. Plague doctors wore a mask of some form since at least 1373. Most depictions come from satirical writings and political cartoons. The beaked plague doctor inspired costumes in Italian theater as a symbol of general horror and death, though some historians insist that the plague doctor was originally fictional and inspired the real plague doctors later. Depictions of the beaked plague doctor rose in response to superstition and fear about the unknown source of the plague.

Often, these plague doctors were the last thing a patient would see before death; therefore, the doctors were seen as a foreboding of death. It appears that the only contemporary sources which claim witness to this infamous costume are based in Italy during the 17th century. Later sources based in other areas do claim that this costume was in use in their country (most specifically during the Black Death); however, it is possible that these sources were influenced by theater and other works of fiction.

The typical mask had glass openings for the eyes and a curved leather beak, shaped like a bird&#x27;s beak, with straps that held the beak in front of the doctor&#x27;s nose. The mask had two small nose holes and was a type of respirator which contained aromatic items. The first known observation of the herbal-stuffed beak was during the 1656–1658 epidemic in Rome. The beak could hold dried flowers (like roses and carnations), herbs (like lavender and peppermint), camphor, or a vinegar sponge, as well as juniper berry, ambergris, cloves, labdanum, myrrh, and storax. The herbs right up against the nose inside the beak allowed for the doctor to have both of their hands free in order to examine the patient or corpse. The purpose of the mask was to keep away bad smells such as decaying bodies and the smell taken with the most caution was known as miasma, a noxious form of &quot;bad air&quot;. This was thought to be the principal cause of the disease. Doctors believed the herbs would counter the &quot;evil&quot; smells of the plague and prevent them from becoming infected.

The wide-brimmed leather hat indicated their profession, they used wooden canes in order to point out areas needing attention and to examine patients without touching them. The canes were also used to keep people away and to remove clothing from plague victims without having to touch them. The doctor&#x27;s long robe was made from linen because it was said contagion did not stick to linen as easily as other materials. The robe was also sometimes made from goat skin, which was said to be stronger against the plague than linen because of its small pores and polished texture. It was not unheard of for the robe to be sealed with oil or wax for an extra layer of protection so the &quot;bad air&quot; could not seep through the holes of the linen material. Though contemporary theories about the plague&#x27;s nature were incorrect, it is likely that the costume actually did afford the wearer some protection. The garments covered the body, shielding against splattered blood, lymph and cough droplets, and the waxed robe prevented fleas (the true carriers of the plague) from touching the body or clinging to the linen. The costume of the plague doctor is one of the earliest examples of a hazmat suit.

This well known costume now is used as common costume in festivals mainly in Europe and within the art of theater.

==Contract==
A plague doctor&#x27;s contract was an agreement between a town&#x27;s administrators and a doctor to treat bubonic plague patients. These contracts are present in European city archives. Their contractual responsibility was to treat plague patients, and no other type of patient, to prevent spreading the disease to the uninfected. A plague doctor had to serve a long quarantine after seeing a plague patient. The doctor was regarded as a &quot;contact&quot; who by agreement had to live in isolation to be quarantined.

===Negotiations===
The bargaining which always preceded the final contract often consisted of serious negotiations. For example, the town administrators of Turin in 1630 were considering the terms of an agreement requested by one Dr. Maletto to become their plague doctor. After much negotiating, they instructed their broker representatives to make a fair and prompt deal as soon as possible with Dr. Maletto. They were told to get the best possible deal for their city, but to be careful not to lose the opportunity of hiring this plague doctor, as it would be difficult to find someone else to perform these dangerous duties at such a low rate.

As an example of the tough negotiating that went on between plague doctors and infected European towns, there is in Pavia an original agreement between one Giovanni de Ventura and the city in their archives that shows a sixteen clause contract that was further amended after it was originally written. Clause one originally showed 30 florins per month for pay but was later modified to be net of living expenses. Clause two was originally that the pay was to be given two months in advance but later modified to monthly. Clause five provided originally a severance pay of two months but later modified that to one month&#x27;s pay. Clause six stated that &quot;the said master Giovanni shall not be bound nor held under obligation except only in attending the plague patients&quot;, which was later amplified with &quot;...the doctor must treat all patients and visit infected places as it shall be found to be necessary.&quot; Clause seven had to do with full citizenship and the original text was modified with &quot;according to how he shall behave himself.&quot;

Bernardino di Francesco Rinaldi obtained a clause in his contract when he was hired as plague doctor by the city of Volterra in 1527 that said essentially that the city had the obligation to provide Bernardino with all and everything necessary for his life support (i.e. food, water), and for these living expenses to be paid through the city expenditures.

===Reprimands===
In 1527, in the city of Prato, a plague doctor named Stefano Mezzettino was seen attending to other patients without a custodian. The rule in the plague doctor contract was that a custodian must always be with the plague doctor when he visits other patients. This created much danger for the public. He was fined for his illegal act and breaking the rule of the plague doctor contract.

==Notable plague doctors==
* The Italian city of Pavia, in 1479, contracted Giovanni de Ventura as a community plague doctor.
* The Irish physician Niall Ó Glacáin (–1653) earned deep respect in Spain, France and Italy for his bravery in treating numerous people with the plague.
* The French anatomist Ambroise Paré and Swiss iatrochemist Paracelsus were also famous Renaissance plague doctors.
* Nostradamus gave advice about preventive measures against the plague, such as the removal of infected corpses, getting fresh air, drinking clean water, and drinking a juice preparation of rose hips. In Part A Chapter VIII, Nostradamus also recommended to not bleed the patient.
* John Paulitious was Edinburgh&#x27;s first plague doctor, but he died in June 1645 only weeks after beginning employment. He was succeeded by George Rae.

<doc id="560309" wikidata="Q3106664" url="?curid=560309" title="T. Berry Brazelton">
<text>Thomas Berry Brazelton (May 10, 1918 – March 13, 2018) was an American pediatrician, author, and the developer of the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). Brazelton hosted the cable television program &quot;What Every Baby Knows&quot;, and wrote a syndicated newspaper column. He wrote more than two hundred scholarly papers and twenty-four books.

==Biography==
Brazelton was born in Waco, Texas. He graduated in 1940 from Princeton and in 1943 from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, where he accepted a medical internship at Roosevelt Hospital. From 1945, after war service in the U.S. Navy, he completed his medical residency in Boston Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) before undertaking pediatric training at Children&#x27;s Hospital of Boston.

He entered private practice in 1950, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His interest in child development led to training in child psychiatry at MGH and the James Jackson Putnam Children&#x27;s Center. He subsequently served as a Fellow with Professor Jerome Bruner at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard University, then combined his interests in primary care pediatrics and child psychiatry and in 1972 established the Child Development Unit, a pediatric training and research center at Children&#x27;s Hospital in Boston. From 1988, he was Clinical Professor of Pediatrics Emeritus at Harvard Medical School.

Brazelton was president of the Society for Research in Child Development (1987–1989), and of the National Center for Clinical Infant Programs (1988–1991). He appeared many times before Congressional committees in support of parental and medical leave bills, and continued to work with the Alliance for Better Child Care for a more comprehensive day care bill. He was a co-founder of Parent Action and served on the National Commission on Children.

Brazelton is widely known for developing a &quot;child-oriented&quot; approach suggesting to start toilet training not earlier than 24 months of child&#x27;s age while looking for &quot;readiness signs&quot; for mature toilet behavior. In his work, he shared his opinion that &quot;...there is little innate in the child that leads [them] to want to be clean and dry, it must be understood as a kind of compliance to external pressure&quot;, that parents should withstand &quot;external pressure&quot; of grandparents to start toilet education around 9 months of age and postpone it until a child is demonstrating certain &quot;readiness signs&quot;. Later Brazelton served as Chairman of Pampers Parenting Institute funded by P&amp;G Corporation, a global disposable diaper market leader. He also participated in Pampers advertising for Toddler diapers N6.

Brazelton appeared several times on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and the &quot;Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;.

==Neonatal behavior==
Brazelton&#x27;s foremost achievement in pediatrics and child development has been to increase pediatricians&#x27; awareness of, and attention to, the effect of young children&#x27;s behavior, activity states, and emotional expressions on the ways their parents react to, and thereby affect them. For example, one of his first publications in the field of psychology was a study with Kenneth Kaye of the interaction between babies&#x27; sucking at breast or bottle and the mother&#x27;s attempts to maintain it, the earliest form of human &quot;dialogue&quot;. The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) assesses not only the physical and neurological responses of newborns, but also their emotional well-being and individual differences.

The Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) looks at a wide range of behaviors and is suitable for examining newborns and infants up to two months old. By the end of the assessment, the examiner has a behavioral &quot;portrait&quot; of the infant, describing the baby&#x27;s strengths, adaptive responses and possible vulnerabilities. The examiner shares this portrait with parents to develop appropriate caregiving strategies aimed at enhancing the earliest relationship between babies and parents.
It evaluates a wide range of 38 behaviors to build a behavioral profile of an infant up to 2 months old. The Scale contains 28 behavioral and 18 reflex items. It assesses the baby&#x27;s capabilities across different developmental areas (autonomic, motor, state and social-interactive systems) and describes how infants integrate these areas as they adapt to their new environment. This approach was innovative for recognizing that a baby is a highly developed organism, even when just newly born. The profile describes the baby&#x27;s strengths, adaptive responses and possible vulnerabilities.

The NBAS is based on several key assumptions.
First, infants, even ones that seem vulnerable, are highly capable when they are born. &quot;A newborn already has nine months of experience when she is born,&quot; Dr. Brazelton notes. &quot;She is capable of controlling her behavior in order to respond to her new environment.&quot;
Second, babies &quot;communicate&quot; through their behavior, which, although it may not always seem like it, is a rational language. Not only do infants respond to cues around them, like their parents&#x27; faces, but they also take steps to control their environment, such as crying to get a response from their caregivers.
Third, infants are social organisms, individuals with their own unique qualities, ready to shape as well as be shaped by the caregiving environment.

<doc id="560314" wikidata="Q6619808" url="?curid=560314" title="List of Academy Award nominees presented under false names">
<text>There have been several fictional people or people using false names nominated for actual Academy Awards, in several cases because the actual winners were blacklisted at the time. This list is current as of the 94th Academy Awards.

== Winners ==

Pierre Boulle
* 1957 Best Writing Adapted Screenplay for &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;
::Despite not having written the screenplay and not even speaking English, Boulle (who had written the novel on which the film was based) was credited because the film&#x27;s actual writers, Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, had been blacklisted as communist sympathizers. On December 11, 1984, the Board of Governors voted posthumous Oscars to the duo.

Nathan E. Douglas
* 1958 Best Writing, Story and Screenplay – Written Directly for the Screen for &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;
::Nedrick Young and Harold Jacob Smith co-wrote the screenplay, but Young was blacklisted and used a pseudonym for his screen credit. As an inside joke, director Stanley Kramer cast Young and Smith in bit parts as truck drivers and had their screen credit appear while they were on screen together. In 1993, AMPAS restored Young&#x27;s credit for this work.

Ian McLellan Hunter
* 1953 Best Story for &quot;Roman Holiday&quot;
::The name was used as a cover for blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo. On December 15, 1992, the Board of Governors voted to change the records and recognize Trumbo. Hunter&#x27;s name was removed. However, Hunter&#x27;s son, director Tim Hunter, refused to cede the award to Trumbo, so the Academy presented a second Academy Award.

Robert Rich
* 1956 Best Story for &quot;The Brave One&quot;
::This was another cover for Trumbo. Shortly before his death, Trumbo revealed the much-suspected truth.

== Nominees ==

Roderick Jaynes
* 1997 Best Film Editing for &quot;Fargo&quot;
* 2007 Best Film Editing for &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot;
::Writer-director brothers Joel and Ethan Coen have edited several of their films under this name.

Adrien Joyce
* 1971 Best Writing Original Screenplay for &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot;
::Carole Eastman wrote the film under this pseudonym with director Bob Rafelson.

Donald Kaufman
* 2003 Best Writing Adapted Screenplay for &quot;Adaptation.&quot;
::Donald Kaufman was nominated along with his &quot;brother&quot; Charlie. In fact, Donald does not exist; the screenplay was written by Charlie alone, but credited to both. Donald was the first fictitious nominee not to be a cover for a real person. (Both appear as characters in the film.)

John Mac McMurphy
* 2013 Best Film Editing for &quot;Dallas Buyers Club&quot;
::Director Jean-Marc Vallée edited his film using this pseudonym, inspired by the name of the character played by Jack Nicholson in the movie &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

P.H. Vazak
* 1985 Best Writing Adapted Screenplay for &quot;&quot;.
::Due to his disapproval of the final filmed script, Robert Towne used his dog&#x27;s name as a pseudonym instead.

*Alan Smithee, a pseudonym used by directors who don&#x27;t want their name attached to a film

<doc id="560323" wikidata="Q1473324" url="?curid=560323" title="Scottish Football League Second Division">
<text>The Scottish Football League Second Division was the third tier of the Scottish football league system between 1975 and 2013.

==History==
The Second Division was created in 1975, as part of a wider reconstruction of the Scottish Football League (SFL). Prior to 1975, the SFL had been split into two divisions (Division One and Division Two). The effect of the reconstruction was to split these two divisions into three, with the top flight named the Premier Division, second tier the First Division, and a new third tier was created known as the Second Division. A fourth tier, known as the Third Division, was created in 1994.

In 1998, the Premier Division clubs broke away from the SFL to form the Scottish Premier League (SPL). The Second Division continued as before, but it was now the second level of the SFL. In 2013, the SFL and SPL merged to form the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL). The SPFL named its third tier as Scottish League One, which effectively replaced the Second Division.

==Competition==
From 1994 until 2013, the Second Division consisted of ten teams. From 1994 to 2006, the top two teams were promoted to the First Division and the bottom two were relegated to the Third Division. From 2006 to 2013, the top team in the Second Division was promoted to the First Division, while the clubs in 2nd through 4th places entered an end of season play-off with the 9th placed side in the First Division. The bottom club was automatically relegated to the Third Division and the 9th placed club entered an end of season play-off with the second, third and fourth placed clubs from the Third Division.

The teams played each other four times with three points for a victory and one point each for a drawn game. In the event of two teams finishing with the same number of points, the respective teams&#x27; position is decided on goal difference. If goal difference is equal too, the team who has scored the most goals is placed higher.

Most players in the Second Division were part-time professionals.

==Winners of the Second Division==


b.Team failed to gain promotion via play-offs

== Notes ==
* 1. Airdrie United lost in the play-offs, but were promoted due to Gretna&#x27;s demotion to the Third Division, and subsequent resignation from the Scottish Football League.

<doc id="560325" wikidata="Q5504403" url="?curid=560325" title="Friendship Heights station">
<text>Friendship Heights station is a Washington Metro station on the Red Line straddling the border of Washington, D.C., and Montgomery County, Maryland, United States. The station was opened on August 25, 1984, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).

==Location==
The station is at the 5400 block of Wisconsin Avenue, Northwest and serves the neighborhoods of Chevy Chase and Friendship Heights. The area is a major retail shopping and broadcast media district. The station also serves as a bus depot linking Montgomery County Transit&#x27;s Ride-On bus system with the Washington Metro. It is directly adjacent to the Western Division Metrobus garage on 44th Street and Harrison Street NW.

=== Notable places nearby ===
* GEICO Headquarters
* Lisner-Louise-Dickson-Hurt Home
* The Shops at Wisconsin Place, Chevy Chase Pavilion, and other shopping centers
* WSBN, WMAL-FM, WLVW, WTOP-FM, and WFED radio stations

==History==
The station opened on August 25, 1984. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Van Ness–UDC station and the opening of the Bethesda, Grosvenor, Medical Center and Tenleytown stations.

==Station layout==
This station uses the four-coffer arch design found at most underground stations on the western side of the Red Line. Unlike its many counterparts such as Van Ness-UDC and Tenleytown-AU, the station&#x27;s walls are more rounded. Friendship Heights is the only station in the system with this design that has mezzanines at both ends of the platform.

The station is one of 11 stations in the system constructed with rock tunneling and is accordingly deeper than most stations in the system. Its platform is more than below its north entrance. The escalator has a length of and rises feet above the mezzanine level. The escalator ride from the common room at the north entrance to the mezzanine level takes roughly a minute and a half.

Two of its five exits sit on the Maryland side of Western Avenue, whereas the other three exit into the District. At the Western Avenue entrance, four separate street entrances come together in an upper mezzanine, allowing riders to access a set of three escalators that go to the platform. One entrance is located at a side entrance to the lobby of an entrance to the former C-level of Mazza Gallerie that has access to Western Avenue. Another entrance offers direct access to Chevy Chase Pavilion. The newest entrance, located off Wisconsin Avenue next to The Shops at Wisconsin Place, opened between 2011 and 2022, replacing an earlier entrance that led directly into a Hecht&#x27;s. The new entrance is located across Wisconsin Avenue from the station&#x27;s main entrance, which surfaces in a large bus depot underneath the Chevy Chase Metro Building. A second entrance, at the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Jenifer Street NW, is elevator-only, with four high-speed elevators servicing the station&#x27;s south mezzanine.

<doc id="560326" wikidata="Q863371" url="?curid=560326" title="Biltmore Conference">
<text>The Biltmore Conference, also known by its resolution as the Biltmore Program, was a fundamental departure from traditional Zionist policy by its demand &quot;that Palestine be established as a Jewish Commonwealth.&quot; The meeting was held in New York City, at the prestigious Biltmore Hotel, from May 6 to May 11, 1942, with 600 delegates and Zionist leaders from 18 countries attending.

The program has been described by a number of historians as &quot;a virtual coup d’état&quot; within Zionism since the movement&#x27;s more moderate leaders were replaced by leaders with more aggressive goals.

==History==

Prior to this Extraordinary Zionist Conference at the Biltmore, official Zionism had steadfastly refused to formulate the ultimate aim of the movement but preferred to concentrate on the practical task of building the Jewish National Home. The Biltmore Program became the official Zionist stand on the ultimate aim of the movement. According to Ben-Gurion, the &quot;first and essential&quot; stage of the program was the immigration of two million additional Jews to Palestine. In 1944, a One Million Plan would become the official policy of the Zionist leadership. There was no reference to the Arab population prevailing in Mandatory Palestine, which, according to Anita Shapira, marked a transition to the view that conflict was inevitable between the Arabs and Jews and could only be resolved by the sword.

The major shift at Biltmore was prompted by intense common opposition to the British White Paper of 1939, which interpreted the terms of the Mandate in a way that would freeze &quot;the Jewish community to a permanent minority status&quot;, and the negative situation during the war. The shift was prompted also by the realization that America would play a larger part in fulfillment of Zionist designs after the war.

Official Zionism’s firm unequivocal stand did not please everyone, however. The pro-British Chaim Weizmann had bristled at it. Also, binationalists such as Henrietta Szold and Judah L. Magnes rejected the stand and broke off to establish their own party, Ichud (&quot;Unification&quot;), which advocated an Arab–Jewish federation. Opposition to the Biltmore Program also led to the founding of the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism.

Various Zionist organizations were represented in the American Emergency Committee of Zionist Affairs, which called an &quot;Extraordinary Zionist Conference&quot; as a substitute for the full (22nd) Zionist Congress, which had been cancelled because of World War II. Attendees included Chaim Weizmann, as President of the Zionist Organization; David Ben-Gurion, as Chairman of the Jewish Agency Executive; and Nahum Goldmann, as a member of the Executive of the Zionist Organization of America. The four main organisations of American Jewry represented were the Zionist Organization of America, Hadassah, Mizrahi, and Poale Zion. Among the American organizers was Reform Rabbi Abba Hillel Silver.

==Declaration==
The joint statement issued at the end of the session was known as the Biltmore Program. It asked for unrestricted Jewish immigration to Palestine. Here is the full text of the program:

#&quot;American Zionists assembled in this Extraordinary Conference reaffirm their unequivocal devotion to the cause of democratic freedom and international justice to which the people of the United States, allied with the other United Nations, have dedicated themselves, and give expression to their faith in the ultimate victory of humanity and justice over lawlessness and brute force.&quot;
#&quot;This Conference offers a message of hope and encouragement to their fellow Jews in the Ghettos and concentration camps of Hitler-dominated Europe and prays that their hour of liberation may not be far distant.&quot;
#&quot;The Conference sends its warmest greetings to the Jewish Agency Executive in Jerusalem, to the Va`ad Leumi, and to the whole Yishuv in Palestine, and expresses its profound admiration for their steadfastness and achievements in the face of peril and great difficulties ...&quot;
#&quot;In our generation, and in particular in the course of the past twenty years, the Jewish people have awakened and transformed their ancient homeland; from 50,000 at the end of the last war their numbers have increased to more than 500,000. They have made the waste places to bear fruit and the desert to blossom. Their pioneering achievements in agriculture and in industry, embodying new patterns of cooperative endeavour, have written a notable page in the history of colonization.&quot;
#&quot;In the new values thus created, their Arab neighbours in Palestine have shared. The Jewish people in its own work of national redemption welcomes the economic, agricultural and national development of the Arab peoples and states. The Conference reaffirms the stand previously adopted at Congresses of the World Zionist Organization, expressing the readiness and the desire of the Jewish people for full cooperation with their Arab neighbours.&quot;
#&quot;The Conference calls for the fulfillment of the original purpose of the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate which recognizing the historical connection of the Jewish people with Palestine&#x27; was to afford them the opportunity, as stated by President Wilson, to found there a Jewish Commonwealth. The Conference affirms its unalterable rejection of the White Paper of May 1939 and denies its moral or legal validity. The White Paper seeks to limit, and in fact to nullify Jewish rights to immigration and settlement in Palestine, and, as stated by Mr. Winston Churchill in the House of Commons in May 1939, constitutes `a breach and repudiation of the Balfour Declaration&#x27;. The policy of the White Paper is cruel and indefensible in its denial of sanctuary to Jews fleeing from Nazi persecution; and at a time when Palestine has become a focal point in the war front of the United Nations, and Palestine Jewry must provide all available manpower for farm and factory and camp, it is in direct conflict with the interests of the allied war effort.&quot;
#&quot;In the struggle against the forces of aggression and tyranny, of which Jews were the earliest victims, and which now menace the Jewish National Home, recognition must be given to the right of the Jews of Palestine to play their full part in the war effort and in the defence of their country, through a Jewish military force fighting under its own flag and under the high command of the United Nations.&quot;
#&quot;The Conference declares that the new world order that will follow victory cannot be established on foundations of peace, justice and equality, unless the problem of Jewish homelessness is finally solved. The Conference urges that the gates of Palestine be opened; that the Jewish Agency be vested with control of immigration into Palestine and with the necessary authority for upbuilding the country, including the development of its unoccupied and uncultivated lands; and that Palestine be established as a Jewish Commonwealth integrated in the structure of the new democratic world.&quot;

::&quot;Then and only then will the age old wrong to the Jewish people be righted.&quot;
After approval by the Zionist General Council in Palestine, the Biltmore Program was adopted as the platform of the World Zionist Organization.

==Jewish commonwealth==
The significance of the program to a Jewish commonwealth was in stepping beyond the terms of the Balfour Declaration, which had been reaffirmed as British policy by Winston Churchill&#x27;s White Paper of 1922, that there should be a &quot;Jewish National Home&quot; in Palestine. According to Ami Isseroff, the program was &quot;a crucial step in the development of the Zionist movement, which increasingly saw itself as opposed to Britain rather than a collaborator of Britain, and it determined that henceforth Ben-Gurion and the Zionist Executive in Palestine, rather than Weizmann would lead the Zionist movement and determine policy toward the British.&quot;

The program spoke of the Jewish people for &quot;the economic, agricultural and national development of the Arab peoples and states&quot; but was implicitly a rejection of the proposal for a binational solution to the question of Arab-Jewish co-existence in Palestine. Hashomer Hatzair, a socialist-Zionist group, accordingly voted against the program.

The estimates for the destruction of European Jewry grew throughout 1942 and 1943. Chaim Weizmann urged a re-evaluation of the Biltmore program in June 1943. Weizmann’s earlier estimate of 25% destruction, which had been declared at the Biltmore Conference, now seemed wildly optimistic. Rabbi Meyer Berlin, the leader of the Mizrahi, a Zionist party, disagreed and argued that no one could know how many Jews would survive and how many would die.

==American Jewish Conference==
At the American Jewish Conference of 29 August 1943, the program&#x27;s adoption was challenged by Joseph Proskauer and Robert Goldman. They argued that the immediate problem was the rescue effort, not the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth. Goldman felt that the program was unduly weighted in favour of the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth and that focusing on that as a priority would hamper the efforts to rescue the European Jewry.

However, Abba Silver and Emanuel Neumann put forward that the establishment of a Jewish commonwealth should be the movement&#x27;s primary aim.

<text>Daniel Carroll Jr. (July 22, 1730May 7, 1796) was an American politician and plantation owner from Maryland and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He supported the American Revolution, served in the Confederation Congress, was a delegate to the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 which penned the Constitution of the United States, and was a U.S. Representative in the First Congress. Carroll was one of five men to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution. He was one of the few Roman Catholics among the Founders.

==Early life==

Carroll was born in Marlborough Town in the Province of Maryland on July 22, 1730. He was the son of wealthy planters Daniel Carroll (c.1696 - 1751) and Eleanor Darnall Carroll (1703 - 1796). His parents&#x27; home was Darnall&#x27;s Chance, a plantation of 27,000 acres which his mother had inherited from her grandfather. Carroll was sent abroad for his education. Between 1742 and 1748 he studied under the Jesuits at the College of St. Omer in France, established for the education of English Catholics. Then, after a tour of Europe, he sailed home and soon married Eleanor Carroll, apparently a first cousin, whose grandparents were Daniel O&#x27;Caroll and Dorothy Kennedy from Ireland.

His younger brother John was the first Roman Catholic bishop in the United States (as Bishop of Baltimore, 1790) and founder of Georgetown University; his cousin Charles Carroll of Carrollton signed the Declaration of Independence.

==Career==
In the 1770s, Carroll gradually joined the Patriot cause. As a slaveholder and large landholder, he was initially concerned that the Revolution might fail economically and bring about his family&#x27;s financial ruin and mob rule.

At the time, Maryland, though Catholic-founded, had (like the rest of the Thirteen Colonies) issued laws excluding Roman Catholics from holding public office. When Maryland declared its independence from the Crown and enacted its first constitution, these laws were nullified. Carroll was elected to the Maryland Senate, serving 1777–1781. As a state senator, he helped raise troops and money for the American cause. His involvement in the Revolutionary War, like that of other Patriots in his extended family, was inspired by the family&#x27;s motto: &quot;Strong in Faith and War&quot;.

He led the effort to block the State Assembly from ratifying of the Articles of Confederation until the states that had western land claims (which Maryland did not) ceded those claims to Congress. Carroll dropped his opposition only after Virginia relinquished its claims on land north of the Ohio River to Congress, and on February 2, 1781, Maryland became the thirteenth and final state to ratify the Articles.

==Constitutional Convention of 1787==
In 1787, Carroll was named a Maryland delegate to the Philadelphia Convention, which convened to revise the Articles, and produced the Constitution. Like his good friend James Madison of Virginia, Carroll was convinced that a strong central government was needed to regulate commerce among the states and with other nations. He also spoke out repeatedly in opposition to the payment of members of the United States Congress by the states, reasoning that such compensation would sabotage the strength of the new government because &quot;the dependence of both Houses on the state Legislatures would be complete ... The new government in this form is nothing more than a second edition of [the Continental] Congress in two volumes, instead of one, and perhaps with very few amendments.&quot;

When it was suggested that the president (executive branch) should be elected by the Congress (legislative branch), Carroll, seconded by James Wilson, moved that the words &quot;by the legislature&quot; be replaced with &quot;by the people&quot;. He and Thomas Fitzsimons were the only Roman Catholics to sign the Constitution, but their presence was a sign of the continued advancement of religious freedom in America. Carroll played an essential role in formulating the limitation of the powers of the federal or central government. He was the author of the presumption—enshrined in the Constitution as a closing article – that powers not specifically delegated to the federal government were reserved to the states or to the people. Carroll spoke about 20 times during the summer of debates at the Constitutional Convention and served on the Committee on Postponed Matters. Returning to Maryland after the convention, he campaigned for ratification of the Constitution but was not a delegate to the Maryland state convention for ratification.

==Political career==
Following the convention, Carroll continued to be involved in state and national affairs. He was a key participant in the Maryland ratification struggle of 1787–1788. He defended the Constitution in the &quot;Maryland Journal&quot;, most notably in his response to the arguments advanced by the well-known Anti-Federalist and Patriot delegate Samuel Chase. After ratification was achieved in Maryland, Carroll was elected as a representative (&quot;congressman&quot;) to the Sixth Congressional District of Maryland to the First Congress of 1789, meeting in New York City. Given his concern for economic and fiscal stability, he voted for the assumption of state debts accumulated during the war by the federal government to establish a new level of financial confidence of credible public debts as proposed by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton as part of a &quot;grand bargain&quot; with Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, for Northerners to support locating the new national capital in the upper South, along the Potomac River.

One of three commissioners appointed to survey the newly designated District of Columbia and acquire land for the new federal capital in the District, Carroll was related to two major landowners whose land was acquired by the government, his brother-in-law Notley Young and nephew Daniel Carroll of Duddington. The United States Capitol was built on a wooded hill owned by his nephew. As one of his first official acts as commissioner, on April 15, 1791, he and fellow commissioner David Stuart of Virginia laid the cornerstone for the beginning boundary line survey of the District at Jones Point, on the south bank of the Potomac near Alexandria, formerly in Virginia. He served as a commissioner until 1795, when he retired because of poor health.

He later was again elected to the Maryland Senate. He had many interests in his state and region, including the &quot;Patowmack Company&quot;, which sought to build a Patowmack Canal to the West. This was a long-time project of George Washington since his western explorations and military campaigns against the French. This predated the survey and construction thirty years later of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.

Carroll died May 7, 1796, at age 65, at his home near Rock Creek in the present neighborhood of Forest Glen, Maryland. Carroll&#x27;s body was buried there in Saint John the Evangelist Catholic Church Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Carroll Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in his honor.

<doc id="560340" wikidata="Q3640069" url="?curid=560340" title="Bowman-Biltmore Hotels">
<text>Bowman-Biltmore Hotels was a hotel chain created by the hotel magnate John McEntee Bowman.

The name evokes the Vanderbilt family&#x27;s Biltmore Estate, whose buildings and the gardens within are privately owned historical landmarks and tourist attractions in Asheville, North Carolina, United States. The name has since been adopted by other unrelated hotels. For a time, the Bowman-Biltmore Hotels Corporation was a publicly traded company.

== Historic locations ==
== Planned hotels==
A Detroit Biltmore was planned for the site of the Hotel Tuller on Detroit&#x27;s Grand Circus Park. The Tuller was to have been demolished in 1929 and replaced by a towering 35-story, 1500 room hotel with an attached 14-story garage and 18-story office building. The plans were abandoned when the stock market crashed that year.

== Unassociated hotels ==
=== Florida ===
The Palm Beach Biltmore was not connected to the Bowman Biltmore group. It was built in 1926 as the Alba, renamed The Ambassador in 1929, and sold to Henry L. Doherty in 1933. Doherty, who had bought the Miami Biltmore two years earlier, renamed the hotel the Palm Beach Biltmore. It was later owned by Hilton Hotels, closed in the 1970s, and was converted to condos from 1979 to 1981.

===Hawaii===

The Waikiki Biltmore was a resort hotel on Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii, that operated from 1955 to 1974. The Biltmore was the first high-rise hotel on Waikiki but operated for only 19 years and was demolished and replaced with the Hyatt Regency. 

Permits were filed for an eight-story hotel in March 1953, with groundbreaking taking place in November of that year. Joseph Greenbach constructed the building, which opened on February 19, 1955. Construction cost $4 million. The hotel was built on the site of Canlis Charcoal Broiler, the first restaurant opened by Peter Canlis, which opened in 1947. The opening was met with great fanfare, including a flight from California chartered by Greenbach.

=== Nevada ===
The Tahoe Biltmore, a hotel-casino, operated from 1948 to 2022 in Crystal Bay, Nevada. It is expected to be demolished in 2025, with a Waldorf Astoria hotel taking its place in 2028.

===Oklahoma===
The Oklahoma Biltmore in Oklahoma City was an unassociated hotel that once stood downtown, at 228 West Grand Avenue. It was built in 1932 during the Great Depression by the city&#x27;s prominent civic leaders at the time, headed by Charles F. Colcord. Designed by architects Hawk &amp; Parr, the Biltmore had 619 rooms and was 24 stories high, making it the state&#x27;s second tallest building only to the Ramsey Tower built in 1931, when it was completed. In 1936 alone, the Biltmore was headquarters for 104 conventions and saw 114,171 guests. After a $3 million renovation in the mid-1960s the Biltmore was renamed the Sheraton-Oklahoma Hotel. By 1973, the hotel had left Sheraton, and the Oklahoma City Urban Renewal Authority agreed with the owners that the Biltmore had outlived its useful life. In contrast, architect I. M. Pei had envisioned keeping the hotel, and his sketches and models all showed the tower overlooking the surrounding &quot;Tivoli Gardens&quot;. The hotel was one of the largest demolitions in the country at the time it was blown up on October 16, 1977, by a team of demolition specialists to make way for the &quot;Myriad Gardens&quot;. Hundreds of low-yield explosives were planted throughout the building so that it would collapse and fall inward into an acceptable area only slightly larger than the hotel&#x27;s foundation.

<text>Bethesda station is a rapid transit station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro system in Bethesda, Maryland. It is one of the busiest suburban Metro stations, serving on average 9,142 passengers each weekday in 2017. The Purple Line, a light rail system currently under construction, will terminate at Bethesda, providing rail service to other inner Maryland suburbs such as Silver Spring and College Park, each of which has additional north–south connections by Washington Metro, and New Carrollton, which has Amtrak and MARC connections to both Washington, D.C., and Baltimore.

==Location==

Located at the center of the area&#x27;s central business district, Bethesda station lies underneath Wisconsin Avenue at its intersection with Montgomery Avenue. In the direction of Shady Grove, it is the first station wholly within Montgomery County, as Friendship Heights straddles the border between Maryland and Washington, D.C.

==History==

The station opened on August 25, 1984. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Van Ness–UDC station and the opening of the Friendship Heights, Grosvenor, Medical Center and Tenleytown stations. 
In October 2013, a new staircase appeared between the mezzanine and platform.
In October 2014, the replacement of the first of three entrance escalators at the station began. The escalator site preparation, demolition, construction, installation and testing was projected to take approximately 42 weeks to complete. The $8.4 million project was completed on March 22, 2017.

The station&#x27;s construction has been a major boom to the area, with several office buildings being built on (in the Bethesda Metro Center complex) and around it.

The Purple Line system is under construction as of 2025 and is scheduled to open in late 2027.

== Station layout ==

Like the other 10 stations in the system constructed with rock tunneling, Bethesda station is deep underground. Its platform is more than below the street level. Prior to the opening of the Wheaton station, the Bethesda station had the longest escalator in the Western Hemisphere, at , with a rise of .

The main escalators descending to the station are located on the west side of Wisconsin Avenue, adjacent to the station&#x27;s underground bus bays. A Metro-style tunnel connects passengers to the southeast corner of Wisconsin and Old Georgetown Road. A mezzanine provides fare control and access to the station&#x27;s island platform within the station.

Between January 17 and December 24, 2022, the Bethesda Plaza entrance escalator was replaced with stairs that lead from the bus station to street level. The escalator was replaced because a canopy could not be accommodated that would provide protection from the elements for a new escalator.
A new southern entrance will allow for connections to the Purple Line, which will be located in a tunnel running above the Red Line tunnel. The new entrance has a complex design, and the construction process has included extensive blasting operations. In 2024 it was reported that construction of the new mezzanine has led to large cost overruns.

The Bethesda station is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The station has a single elevator. In the event that the elevator is not operational, the station is not accessible for wheelchair users, who must take a shuttle to the next station. Installation of backup elevators is planned as part of the construction of the Purple Line.

<text>Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer (1723 – November 16, 1790) was an American politician and Founding Father who was one of the signers of the Constitution of the United States. He was active for many years in the Province of Maryland&#x27;s colonial government, but when conflict arose with Great Britain, Jenifer embraced the Patriot cause.

==Early life and colonial career==
Jenifer, born at Coates Retirement (now Ellerslie), an estate west of Port Tobacco in Charles County, Maryland, was the son of Dr. Daniel Jenifer and Elizabeth Mason. As a young man, he acted as a receiver general, the local financial agent for the last two proprietors of Maryland. He was the uncle of Thomas Stone, Michael J. Stone, and John Hoskins Stone. The Jenifer family was of Swedish origin.

Jenifer served as justice of the peace for Charles County and later for the western circuit of Maryland. He sat on a commission that settled a boundary dispute between Pennsylvania and Delaware (1760) and on the Governor&#x27;s Council, the upper house of the Maryland legislature that also served as the colony&#x27;s court of appeals and as a board of senior advisers to the governor (1773–76).

==American Revolution==
Despite his close ties with the colonial government, Jenifer strongly resented what he and most of the colonial gentry saw as Parliament&#x27;s arbitrary interference with the colonies&#x27; affairs, especially its laws concerning taxation and trade regulation. Years before the struggle for independence began, he had defended the proprietors of Maryland against those who sought to make Maryland a Royal colony. When the Revolution came, Jenifer lent his considerable support as a wealthy landowner to the Patriot cause, despite the fact that many leading Patriots had been his enemies in the proprietorship struggle. Jenifer became the president of Maryland&#x27;s Council of Safety, the Patriot body established to organize Maryland&#x27;s military forces for the Revolution (1775–1777). When, in 1776, a new constitution was framed for the state of Maryland, Jenifer commented on the document&#x27;s neglect of popular sovereignty: &quot;The Senate does not appear to me to be a Child of the people at Large, and therefore will not be Supported by them longer than there Subsists the most perfect Union between the different Legislative branches.&quot;

During and after the war, Jenifer became increasingly concerned about national affairs. He represented his state in the Continental Congress (1778–1782) while simultaneously serving as president of Maryland&#x27;s first senate (1777–1780). As manager of his state&#x27;s finances between 1782 and 1785, Jenifer drew on his experiences as a landholder to help the state survive the critical postwar economic depression. Along with James Madison, John Dickinson, George Mason and his good friend George Washington, Jenifer began to explore ways to solve the economic and political problems that had arisen under the weak Articles of Confederation. Consequently, he attended the Mount Vernon Conference, a meeting that led eventually to the Constitutional Convention.

==Constitutional Convention==
Like his old friend Benjamin Franklin, Jenifer enjoyed the status of elder statesman at the Convention, which took place from May 25 to September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Jenifer used his prestige (as well as humor and reputation as pleasant company) to work for a strong and permanent union of the states by reconciling opposing views and formulating the compromises that made the convention a success.

Jenifer took stands on several important issues, although his advanced age restricted his activity in the day-to-day proceedings. Business experience gained while managing a large plantation had convinced him that an active central government was needed to ensure financial and commercial stability. To that end, Jenifer favored a strong and permanent union of the states in which a Congress representing the people had the power to tax. Concerned with continuity in the new government, he favored a three-year term for the United States House of Representatives. Too frequent elections, he concluded, might lead to indifference and would make prominent men unwilling to seek office. Jenifer was outvoted on this point, but his reaction was to marvel at the delegates&#x27; ability to come to agreement on a plan of government: &quot;The first month we only came to grips, and the second it seemed as though we would fly apart forever, however we came as close as friends of eighty years in but days.&quot; When Maryland&#x27;s other delegate, Luther Martin, said that he feared being hanged if the people of Maryland approved the Constitution, Jenifer quipped that Martin should stay in Philadelphia, so that he would not hang in his home state.

==Death and legacy==
After the convention, Jenifer retired to his plantation at Stepney near Annapolis, where he died in 1790. He was buried at Ellerslie, the place of his birth, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places. In his will, Jenifer passed his roughly land holdings to his nephew, Daniel Jenifer, and instructed that all his slaves be freed six years after his death. The following year the younger Jenifer had a son, who was named after his great-uncle. Daniel Jenifer, like his uncle, also served as magistrate in Charles County, as well as three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. His family home, Retreat, was located in Charles County, near one of the largest slave-trading ports of the era, Port Tobacco; it was built in the last quarter of the 18th century and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Jenifer Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in honor of Jenifer. There is also a Jenifer Street in Washington, D.C. Daniel of Saint Thomas Jenifer Elementary school in Charles County was named in his honor. Jenifer Elementary School is located in the Charles County Public Schools school district.

<text>Russell George Manning (January 5, 1929 – December 1, 1981) was an American comic book artist who created the series &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot; and illustrated such newspaper comic strips as &quot;Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Biography==
Manning studied at the Los Angeles County Art Institute, and later, during his US Army service in Japan, drew cartoons for his military base newspaper.

In 1953 he went to work for Western Publishing and illustrated stories for the wide variety of comics published by Western for Dell Comics, and later for Western&#x27;s own Gold Key Comics line. His first notable work was on &quot;Brothers of the Spear&quot;, a backup feature, created by Gaylord Du Bois, in the &quot;Tarzan&quot; comic book. He also drew a few Tarzan stories. He created Gold Key&#x27;s &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter&quot; and &quot;The Aliens&quot; (which ran in the back of the former) in 1963 and drew the first 21 issues, through 1968.

From 1965 to 1969, Manning drew Gold Key&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan&quot; series. During this time, he adapted ten of the first eleven Tarzan novels written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, from scripts written by Gaylord Du Bois. (The adaptation of the sixth, &quot;Jungle Tales of Tarzan&quot;, also scripted by Du Bois, was drawn by Alberto Giolitti rather than Manning). In 1999 the first seven of these were reprinted in three graphic novels by Dark Horse Comics as &quot;Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; Tarzan of the Apes&quot; (&quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Return&quot;, &quot;Beasts&quot;, and &quot;Son of Tarzan&quot;), &quot;Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; Tarzan — The Jewels of Opar&quot;, and &quot;Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; Tarzan The Untamed&quot; (&quot;Tarzan the Untamed&quot; and &quot;Tarzan the Terrible&quot;). These were later reprinted by Dark Horse in one hardcover archive volume. Manning&#x27;s remaining adaptations, not reprinted by Dark Horse, were &quot;Tarzan and the Golden Lion&quot;, &quot;Tarzan and the Ant Men&quot; and &quot;Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle&quot;. They did plan another hardcover archive album. He did not do the finished art on the latter, but provided lay-outs for parts of the story.

Manning also drew the Korak stories in the first 11 issues of Gold Key&#x27;s &quot;Korak&quot; comic (also written by Du Bois). These were reprinted by Dark Horse Comics in 2 hardcover archive collections.

From 1967 to 1972 he drew the &quot;Tarzan&quot; daily newspaper comic strip and stayed on the Sunday page until 1979. He also created four original Tarzan graphic novels for European publication. Two of them were reprinted by Dark Horse Comics in a single trade paperback collection (&quot;Tarzan in The Land That Time Forgot&quot; and &quot;The Pool of Time&quot;) (). During that same period he used assistants, among them William Stout, Rick Hoberg, Mike Royer, and Dave Stevens.

&quot;Magnus&quot;, his and Gold Key&#x27;s best-known heroic-adventure series, was set in the year 4000, which Manning depicted as clean, airy city scapes populated by shiny robots, handsome men, and beautiful women. In an era when many science fiction illustrations still showed interstellar spaceships with fins reminiscent of World War II V-2 rockets, Manning offered more exotic craft. His &quot;Magnus&quot; work was later collected by Dark Horse Comics in three hardcover &quot;archive&quot; editions using a different color palette. Dark Horse then reprinted them in three trade paperbacks.

His final major work was writing and drawing the &quot;Star Wars&quot; newspaper strip in 1979-80. These were collected by Dark Horse Comics as &quot;Classic Star Wars: The Early Adventures&quot; (), which omitted the fact that Manning only drew some of the episodes that were written by Steve Gerber and Archie Goodwin.

Russ Manning died of cancer on December 1, 1981, while still living in California where he was born. He was 52.

The Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award, which is presented annually at San Diego Comic-Con during the Eisner Awards, is named after him.

<doc id="560358" wikidata="Q3780192" url="?curid=560358" title="Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale">
<text>The Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS), also known as the Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale (BNAS), was developed in 1973 by T. Berry Brazelton and his colleagues. This test purports to provide an index of a newborn&#x27;s abilities, and is usually given to an infant somewhere between the age of 3 days to 4 weeks old. The test is designed to describe the neonate&#x27;s response to the environment after being born. This approach was innovative for recognizing that a baby is a highly developed organism, even when just newly born. The profile describes the baby&#x27;s strengths, adaptive responses and possible vulnerabilities. This knowledge may help parents develop appropriate strategies for caring in intimate relationships to enhance their earliest relationship with the child.

==Test procedure==
The Brazelton scale produces a total of 47 scores, of which 27 are behavioral related and 20 are elicited responses. These scores measure a variety of areas including the &quot;neurological, social, and behavioral aspects of a newborn&#x27;s functioning.&quot; Additionally, &quot;factors such as reflexes, responses to stress, startle reactions, cuddliness, motor maturity, ability to habituate to sensory stimuli, and hand-mouth coordination are all assessed.&quot;

Validity evidence is strong for the Brazelton scale, providing a considerable research base. This scale has been used widely as a research tool as well as a diagnostic tool for special purposes. Following is a list of various research projects that have implemented the Brazelton scale:
*&quot;Used to evaluate the effects of low birth weight on premature infants&quot;
*&quot;Used it to study the effects of cocaine use in pregnancy&quot;
*&quot;Prenatal alcohol exposure&quot;
*&quot;Prenatal Iron deficiency&quot;
*&quot;Prenatal maternal mood&quot;
*&quot;Prenatal maternal dopamine levels&quot;
*&quot;Environmental agents&quot;
*&quot;Parent-infant attachment&quot;
*&quot;Gender differences in newborns&quot;
*&quot;High-risk neonates&quot;

Despite the influence of the Brazelton scale, it has some drawbacks. The biggest is that no norms are available. Therefore, as examiners and researchers say that one infant scored higher than another one, there is no standard sample with which to compare. NBAS examiners are trained to encourage neonates to demonstrate a full range of their behavioral capabilities in an attempt to mitigate this potential drawback.

Further, the scores are not completely understood; further testing is required. As for validity, it has &quot;poorly documented predictive and construct validity.&quot; It also does not do a good job at predicting later intelligence, although the scale is supposed to assess the &quot;infant&#x27;s role in the mother-infant social relationship&quot; from which high scores are supposed to presume &quot;high levels of intelligence.&quot;.

A 2018 systematic review of the NBAS on its relationship to supporting caregivers and improving outcomes for caregivers and infants found only very low-quality evidence for improving parent-infant interaction for mostly low-risk, first time caregivers and their infants.

Therefore, the primary value of the test is as a research tool and a supplement test to other medical testing procedures.

Training is necessary for effective and reliable administration of the NBAS.

<text>Medical Center station is a Washington Metro station in Bethesda, Maryland, United States. The island-platformed station was opened on August 25, 1984, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Red Line, the station serves the National Institutes of Health campus and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and is located at Rockville Pike and South Drive. Since there is little retail in the area and no commuter parking lot, this station is used almost exclusively by employees and visitors to those two institutions.

==History==
The station opened on August 25, 1984. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Van Ness–UDC station and the opening of the Bethesda, Friendship Heights, Grosvenor, and Tenleytown stations.

In September 2009, Montgomery County submitted a $20 million federal grant application to build a pedestrian tunnel under Rockville Pike to improve access to the Medical Center stop from Walter Reed Medical Center. Currently, there is only a crosswalk here, with many passengers crossing the heavily travelled street from Walter Reed on the east side of MD 355 to get to the station on the west side. Construction would have originally occurred in 2011, but the project was not approved until 2013. The project is fully funded at $68 million, mostly through the Department of Defense, and includes installation of new deep elevators, improvement of surface bicycle and pedestrian facilities, as well as an extension of the left turn lane on southbound MD 355. The project began construction in 2017. The elevators and staircases of the MD 355 crossing underpass opened in late 2021 and the east side elevators to mezzanine, another elevator to platform, and a new staircase opened on February 25, 2022.

== Station layout ==
Medical Center is the last underground station heading towards , as north of this station, it emerges from the tunnel onto a brief elevated section, crossing the Capital Beltway. 
The station is one of 11 stations in the system constructed with rock tunneling and is accordingly deeper underground than most stations in the system. Its platform is located below its west entrance and more than below street level.

Unlike most other Red Line stations, the escalator bank emerges above ground outside, rather than in a subterranean landing. These escalators are located at the southwest corner of Rockville Pike and South Drive, where bus bays and a kiss and ride lot are also located. The escalators are long and rise from the mezzanine to the entrance landing.

<doc id="560363" wikidata="Q2530426" url="?curid=560363" title="Pierce Butler (American politician)">
<text>Pierce Butler (July 11, 1744February 15, 1822) was an Irish-born American politician who was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Born in the Kingdom of Ireland, Butler emigrated to the British North American colonies, where he fought in the American Revolutionary War. After the war, he served as a state legislator and was a member of the Congress of the Confederation. In 1787, he served as a delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, where Butler signed the Constitution of the United States; he was also a member of the United States Senate.

As one of the largest slaveholders in the United States, he frequently defended American slavery for both political and personal motives, even though he had private misgivings about the institution and particularly about the Atlantic slave trade. He introduced the Fugitive Slave Clause into a draft of the Constitution, which gave a federal guarantee to the property rights of slaveholders. Butler also supported counting the entire slave population in state totals for Congressional apportionment. The Constitution&#x27;s Three-fifths Compromise counted only three-fifths of the enslaved population in state totals but still led to white voters in Southern United States having disproportionate power in the United States Congress.

==Early life==
Butler was born on July 11, 1744, in Garryhundon, County Carlow, Ireland. He was born into the Anglo-Irish Protestant Ascendancy. He was an Anglican until after the American Revolution when he became a member of the Episcopal Church alongside many of America&#x27;s Founding Fathers. He was the third son of Sir Richard Butler, 5th Baronet, of Cloughgrenan (1699–1771), and his wife, Henrietta Percy. He resigned from a commission in the British Army in 1773 and settled with his wife, Mary, in South Carolina.

==Revolutionary war soldier==
In early 1779, Governor John Rutledge asked Butler to help reorganize South Carolina&#x27;s defenses. Butler assumed the post of the state&#x27;s adjutant general, a position that carried the rank of brigadier general. He preferred to be addressed as major, his highest combat rank.

Meanwhile, the British were shifting their wartime strategy. By 1778, King George III and his ministers faced a new military situation in the Thirteen Colonies. Their forces in the northern and middle colonies had reached a stalemate with Washington&#x27;s Continentals, more adequately supplied and better trained after the hard winter at Valley Forge. There was a risk that France would enter the war as a partner of the Americans. The British developed a &quot;southern strategy.&quot; They believed that the many Loyalists in the southern states (with whom the British had an active trade through cotton, rice and tobacco) would rally to the Crown if supported by regular troops. They planned a reconquest of the rebellious colonies one at a time, moving north from Georgia. They launched their new strategy by capturing Savannah in December 1778.

Butler joined to mobilize South Carolina&#x27;s militia to resist the British invasion. Later, he helped prepare the state units used in the counterattack which attempted to drive British forces from Georgia. Butler served as a volunteer aide to General Lachlan McIntosh during the operation, which climaxed with an attempted attack on Savannah. The hastily raised and poorly prepared militia troops could not compete with the well-trained British regulars, and the Patriots&#x27; effort to relieve Savannah were defeated.

In 1780, the British captured Charleston, South Carolina, and with it most of the colony&#x27;s civil government and military forces. Butler escaped as part of a command group deliberately located outside the city. Over the next two years, he developed a counterstrategy to defeat the southern operations of. Refusing to surrender, allies in South Carolina and the occupied portions of Georgia and North Carolina organized guerrilla operations against the British. As adjutant general, Butler worked with former members of the militia and Continental Army veterans such as Francis Marion and Thomas Sumter to integrate the partisan efforts into a unified campaign. They united with the operations of the southern Army under the command of Horatio Gates and later Nathanael Greene.

British forces repeatedly attempted to capture Butler due to his status as a former British Army officer. Several times he barely avoided capture. Throughout the closing phases of the southern campaign, he personally donated cash and supplies to help sustain the American forces and assisted in the administration of prisoner-of-war facilities.

==Politician==
Military operations in the final months of the Revolutionary War left Butler poor. Many of his plantations and ships were destroyed, and the international trade on which most of his income depended was in shambles. To secure loans and establish new markets, he traveled to Europe when the war ended. He enrolled his son Thomas in a London school run by Weeden Butler and engaged a new minister from among the British clergy for his Episcopal church in South Carolina.

In late 1785, Butler returned to the United States. He became an outspoken advocate of reconciliation with former Loyalists and of equal representation for the backcountry residents. Attesting to his growing political influence, the South Carolina legislature asked Butler to represent the state at the Constitutional Convention that met in Philadelphia in 1787. At the convention, he urged that the president be given the power to initiate war but did not receive a second proponent for his motion, and all the other delegates overwhelmingly rejected his proposal.

Butler&#x27;s experiences as a soldier and planter-legislator led to his forceful support for a strong union of the states. At the same time, he looked to the special interests of his region. He introduced the Fugitive Slave Clause (Article 4, Section 2), which established protection for slavery in the Constitution. In addition, while privately criticizing the international trade in enslaved Africans, he supported the passage in the Constitution that prohibited regulation of the trade for 20 years. He advocated counting the entire slave population in the states&#x27; totals for Congressional apportionment but compromised to count three-fifths of the enslaved people toward that end. It ensured that the Southern planter elite exerted a strong influence in national politics for decades.

Butler displayed inconsistencies that troubled his associates. He favored ratification of the Constitution yet did not attend the South Carolina convention that ratified it. Later, he was elected by the South Carolina state legislature to three terms in the United States Senate — from 1789 to October 1796, and from November 1802 to November 1804 — but changed his party allegiance: beginning as a Federalist, he switched to the Democratic-Republicans in 1795. In 1804, he declared himself a political independent. Between his tenures as a senator, Butler ran in South Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in 1798, but overwhelmingly lost to incumbent John Rutledge Jr. After these successive changes, voters did not elect Butler again to national office. They elected him three more times to the state legislature as an easterner who spoke on behalf of the west.

Vice President Aaron Burr was Butler&#x27;s guest at his St. Simons plantations in September 1804. Burr was, at the time, lying low after shooting Alexander Hamilton in the July 1804 duel. The states of New York and New Jersey had each indicted Burr for murder in the duel&#x27;s wake. Burr had traveled during August to Butler&#x27;s plantation under the pseudonym Roswell King, Butler&#x27;s overseer&#x27;s name. During Burr&#x27;s stay in early September, one of the worst hurricanes in history hit the area, and Burr&#x27;s firsthand description documents both his stay and this event.

==Later years, post-politics==

Following his wife&#x27;s death in 1790, Butler sold off the last of their South Carolina holdings and invested in Georgia Sea Island plantations. Butler hired Roswell King as the manager of his two plantations on St. Simon&#x27;s Island and Butler Island. They had some conflicts as Butler wanted more moderate treatment of the people he enslaved than was King&#x27;s style. King left in 1820 to operate a plantation near Darien. He also pursued plans in the 1830s to develop cotton mills in the Piedmont of Georgia, where he founded what became Roswell, Georgia, in 1839.

Butler retired from politics in 1805 and spent much of his time in Philadelphia, where he had previously established a summer home. Through his business ventures, he became one of the wealthiest men in the nation, with substantial land holdings in several states. Like other Founding Fathers from his region, Butler also continued to support the institution of slavery. But unlike Washington or Thomas Jefferson, for example, Butler never acknowledged the fundamental inconsistency in simultaneously defending the people&#x27;s freedom and supporting slavery.

Associates called Butler &quot;eccentric&quot; and an &quot;enigma.&quot; He followed a path to produce the maximum liberty and respect for people he considered citizens. He wanted to maintain a strong central government but one that could never ride roughshod over the rights of the private citizen. He opposed the policies of the Federalists under Alexander Hamilton because he believed they had sacrificed the interests of westerners and had sought to force their policies on the opposition. He later split with Jefferson and the Democrats for the same reason. Butler emphasized his belief in the role of the ordinary person. Late in life, he summarized his view: &quot;Our System is little better than [a] matter of Experiment. ... much must depend on the morals and manners of the people at large.&quot;

==Progeny and succession==

In January 1771, Butler married Mary Middleton (c. 1750–1790). She was the orphaned daughter of Thomas Middleton, a South Carolina planter and slave importer, and was heiress to a large fortune. The couple had eight children:

* Anne Elizabeth Butler (1771–1845), unmarried
* Sarah Butler (1772–1831), married 1800, James Mease of Philadelphia
* Frances Butler (1774–1836), unmarried
* Harriot Percy Butler (1775–1815), unmarried
* Pierce Butler Jr. (1777–1780), died aged three
* Thomas Butler (1778–1838), married 1812, Eliza de Mallevault of Paris=
* 3rd son, died young
* 4th son, died young

Butler disinherited his only surviving son, Thomas Butler, along with his French-born wife and children. Four of Butler&#x27;s daughters reached adulthood, but only one of them, Sarah Mease, married or had children. Butler initially planned to leave his entire fortune to Sarah&#x27;s eldest son, Pierce Butler Mease, but the boy died in 1810 at age 9. Butler told Sarah he would devise his estate in equal parts to her three surviving sons (including one born that year), provided they irrevocably adopt &quot;Butler&quot; as their surname. Two of Sarah&#x27;s sons, John Mease and Pierce Butler Mease (born in 1810 and named for the brother who died), duly changed their surnames to inherit portions of the estate. Until the grandsons came of age, Butler&#x27;s other surviving daughters, Frances and Anne Elizabeth (&quot;Eliza&quot;), had use of the most productive lands.

===John A. Mease Butler===
John A. Mease Butler (1806–1847) inherited half of his grandfather&#x27;s plantations after adopting &quot;Butler&quot; as his surname in 1831. He married Gabriella Morris, but they had no children. He served in the Mexican–American War, attaining the rank of captain, but died of dysentery in camp. He was survived by his wife, who continued to reside on his estates and experienced the effects of the American Civil War. U.S. forces occupied all the Butler plantations beginning in February 1862. The January 1, 1863, Emancipation Proclamation freed all of Gabriella Morris Butler&#x27;s nearly 500 enslaved people. She died later that year.

===Pierce Mease Butler===

Pierce Mease Butler (1810–1867) inherited the other half of his grandfather&#x27;s Butler Island and St. Simons Island plantations after adopting &quot;Butler&quot; as his surname. The English actress Fanny Kemble and her noted actor/manager father, Charles Kemble, made a two-year theatrical tour of the United States in 1832–34. Pierce Mease Butler met her during the tour and married her on June 7, 1834. They lived in Philadelphia and had two daughters, Sarah and Frances. His wife kept a journal of their brief stay on one of their plantations. She expressed extreme horror at the state of life of enslaved people and deconstructed contemporary arguments attempting to justify slavery.

Pierce Mease Butler took his family to Georgia for the winter of 1838–39. Kemble was shocked at the enslaved people&#x27;s living and working conditions and complained to him about their overwork and the manager Roswell King Jr.&#x27;s treatment of them. She noted that King was known to have sired several mixed-race children with enslaved women, whom he sometimes took away from their husbands for periods. Kemble&#x27;s firsthand experiences of the winter residence contributed to her growing abolitionism. The couple had increasing tensions over this and their basic incompatibility. Butler threatened to deny Kemble access to their daughters if she published anything of her observations about the plantation conditions. When they divorced in 1849, he retained custody of their daughters.

Kemble waited until 1863, after the start of the American Civil War and her daughters had come of age, to publish &quot;Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838–1839.&quot; Her eyewitness indictment of slavery included an account of King&#x27;s mixed-race children with slave women. The book was published in both the U.S. and England.

In the social and economic disruption of the postwar years, Pierce Mease Butler was unsuccessful in adapting to the free labor market. Amid a general agricultural depression, he failed to profit from the Sea Island plantations.

====Slave auction====

By mid-century, Pierce Mease Butler was among the richest men in the United States, but he squandered a fortune estimated at $700,000. He was saved from bankruptcy by the sale of his Philadelphia house and then the sale of 436 Georgia slaves on March 2–3, 1859, at Ten Broeck Racetrack, outside Savannah, Georgia. It was the largest single slave auction in U.S. history and netted him more than $300,000 (). The auction was a notable event and covered by national newspapers. He sat out the Civil War in Philadelphia, a refuge for numerous Southerners, and was imprisoned for treason in August–September 1861.

===Later generations===
After Pierce Mease Butler&#x27;s death, his younger daughter Frances Butler Leigh and her husband, James Leigh, a minister, tried to restore productivity and operate the combined plantations but were unsuccessful in generating a profit. They left Georgia in 1877 and moved permanently to England, where Leigh had been born. Frances Butler Leigh defended her father&#x27;s actions as a slaveholder in her book, &quot;Ten Years on a Georgian Plantation since the War&quot; (1883), intended as a rebuttal to her mother&#x27;s critique of slavery from 20 years before.

Pierce Mease Butler&#x27;s elder daughter Sarah Butler Wister married a wealthy Philadelphia doctor, Owen Jones Wister, and they lived in the Germantown section of the city. Their son, Owen Wister, became a popular American novelist, best known for &quot;The Virginian,&quot; a 1902 western novel now considered a classic. The younger Owen Wister was the last of Major Butler&#x27;s descendants to inherit the plantations. He wrote about the post-Civil War South in his 1906 novel, &quot;Lady Baltimore&quot;, which romanticized &quot;the lost aristocrats of antebellum Charleston.&quot; Wister&#x27;s friend and former Harvard classmate, President Theodore Roosevelt, wrote to him criticizing the novel for making &quot;nearly all the devils Northerners and the angels Southerners.&quot;

==Legacy==
Pierce Butler and many of his descendants are buried in a vault in the cemetery of Christ Church, Philadelphia, built in 1727–1744 and a National Historic Landmark.

Butler Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in his honor.

<text>Marshall University is a public research university in Huntington, West Virginia, United States. It was founded in 1837 and is named after John Marshall, the fourth chief justice of the United States. The university is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==

Marshall University was founded in 1837 as a private subscription school by residents of Guyandotte and the surrounding area. The landmark Old Main, which now serves as the primary administrative building for the university, was built on land known as Maple Grove, at the time the home of the Mount Hebron Church in what was then the state of Virginia. John Laidley, a local attorney, hosted the meeting which led to the founding of Marshall Academy, which was named after Laidley&#x27;s friend, the eminent John Marshall who had served as the fourth chief justice of the United States from January 1801 until his death in July 1835.

On March 30, 1838, the institution was formally dedicated by the Virginia General Assembly as Marshall Academy; however this institution was not a college level institution as that was understood at that time. In 1858, the Virginia General Assembly changed the name to Marshall College, but this change still did not reflect its status as a true college. The Civil War closed the often financially challenged school for much of the 1860s.

On June 20, 1863, Cabell County, Virginia, was one of the 50 counties separated from Virginia at the height of the American Civil War to form the state of West Virginia, and the college fell within the new state. In 1867, the West Virginia Legislature resurrected the institution as a teacher training facility and renamed it State Normal School of Marshall College. This began the history of the college as a state-supported post-secondary institution.

===20th century===

With the exception of the Old Main building, expansion of the facilities and the college itself did not begin until 1907, when the West Virginia Board of Regents changed the title of the presiding officer from &quot;principal&quot; to &quot;president&quot; and allowed the creation of new college-level departments. At that time, enrollment surpassed 1,000 students. The school began offering four-year degrees for the first time in 1920.

In 1937, the college suffered through a devastating flooding by the Ohio River. Numerous structures, such as Northcott Hall and the James E. Morrow Library were extensively flooded. Much of Huntington was also heavily damaged, and as a result, a floodwall was constructed around much of the town to prevent future occurrences.

The West Virginia Board of Education authorized Marshall College in 1938 to offer the master&#x27;s degree in six programs: chemistry, education, history, political science, psychology, and sociology, as the institution underwent another expansion. In that year the school was accredited as a &quot;university level institution&quot;; however, elevation to university status would remain a contentious political issue for decades to come. Further expansion accelerated after World War II.

On March 2, 1961, West Virginia Legislature elevated the college to university status, thus becoming Marshall University. Also in 1961, WMUL-FM began operations; it claims to be the first public radio station in West Virginia.

In 1969, the university&#x27;s athletic progran faced a number of scandals regarding recruiting violations and giving cash to athletes. Both the football and basketball coaches were fired; the teams were suspended from the Mid-American Conference. The university rebuilt its athletic program and, in 1977, the university joined the Southern Conference.

====1970 football team airplane crash====
On the evening of November 14, 1970, the Thundering Herd football team, along with coaches and fans, were returning home to Huntington from Kinston, North Carolina. The team had just lost a game 17–14 against the East Carolina University Pirates at Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, North Carolina. The chartered Southern Airways Flight 932 crashed on approach to the Tri-State Airport after clipping trees just west of the runway and impacting, nose-first, into a hollow. All 75 people on board were killed, including 37 team members and five coaches. Thirteen members of the team, as well as the members of the freshman football team, who were not eligible to play varsity under NCAA rules at that time, were not passengers.

The following season a new head coach, Jack Lengyel, was hired. The leaders of the &quot;Young Thundering Herd&quot; (to which the team officially changed its name for the 1971 season) were the few players who did not make the trip due to injury or disciplinary action. Fifteen sophomores from the previous year&#x27;s freshman team were included, as well as a group of freshmen who were allowed to play at the varsity level after the NCAA granted a waiver to its rule barring them from doing so. Three years later, the NCAA would waive the rule for all schools. Completing the squad were players from other Marshall sports programs. They won only two of their 10 games in 1971: a 15–13 victory against the Xavier Musketeers in the season&#x27;s first home game, and a 12–10 homecoming game victory against the Bowling Green Falcons.

A fountain and plaza at the center of the school campus is dedicated to the victims of the crash. The water does not flow from November 14 until the first day of spring football practice the following year. The tragedy and its aftermath were the subject of several documentaries, including the award-winning &quot;Marshall University: Ashes to Glory&quot;. The tragedy and the rebuilding efforts were dramatized in the 2006 Warner Brothers feature &quot;We Are Marshall&quot;, which opened in Huntington a week before its national release date. Many scenes in the movie were filmed on the campus and throughout Huntington.

On February 22, 2023, West Virginia governor Jim Justice signed House Bill 2412 into law, making November 14 an official Memorial Day in remembrance of the Marshall football plane crash across the state.

====From 1970====

In 1971 the Williamson and Logan campuses of Marshall University were combined by the West Virginia Legislature to form Southern West Virginia Community College (now Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College).

In 1977 the university founded its School of Medicine, the first professional school and the first doctoral program. Over the next 20 years the school would add doctoral programs in many fields. Twenty years later, in 1997, the West Virginia Graduate College became the graduate college of Marshall University. Its campus is in South Charleston, West Virginia. In 1998, the John Deaver Drinko Library opened on campus. In 1997, Marshall merged with the West Virginia University College of Graduate Studies (COGS), with the latter being renamed &quot;Marshall University Graduate College&quot;. In 2010 the university was authorized to begin offering undergraduate classes in South Charleston and renamed the facility Marshall University - South Charleston Campus.

Marshall&#x27;s enrollment was 16,500 in 2004. In addition to the main campus in Huntington and the branch campus in South Charleston, West Virginia, the school maintains undergraduate centers in Gilbert, Point Pleasant, and Hurricane, West Virginia.

===21st century===

In 2005, Stephen J. Kopp took over as Marshall University&#x27;s president. Kopp died suddenly in 2014, with Gary G. White, former chairman of the Board of Governors, serving as interim president. Mississippi State University provost Jerome A. Gilbert was named the 37th president on October 20, 2015.

In August 2021, Marshall opened the Bill Noe Flight School at Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia. The Bill Noe Flight School features a 12,000 sq ft. academic building, a hangar, and an aircraft parking apron. The school of aviation offers two undergraduate programs: commercial pilot: fixed wing and aviation maintenance. These programs began accepting students starting in Fall 2021, with additional programs being added in the future.

Other new programs offered by the university include a physician assistant program offered through the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine, which accepted students in its inaugural class in January 2021.

On October 28, 2021, Brad D. Smith was appointed the university&#x27;s 38th president, succeeding the retiring President Jerome Gilbert. Smith, retired CEO of financial software company Intuit, was already a major benefactor of the university.

In early 2022, after the first attacks during the Russo-Ukrainian War, Marshall University professors and staff Victor Fet, Anara Tabyshalievaand, Stefan Schoeberlein, and Kateryna Schray start the weekly podcast &quot;MUkraine&quot;, has been hosted every week since March 2nd, 2022 within a panelist Q&amp;A format. The podcast has hosted over 120 guests that include university professors, philanthropists, charity organizations and Ukrainian refugees, volunteers and soldiers.

In May 2024 Marshall broke ground on a new 80,000 sq ft. Institute for Cyber Security building. The new facility will be a four-story building that will house cybersecurity technology and is scheduled to open by Fall 2026.

==Campus==


Old Main is a collection of five buildings joined at the center of the university&#x27;s campus and has been seen as a symbol of the university. The original structure was completed in 1868, with four other additions that were completed at various intervals until 1907.

The Arthur Weisberg Family Applied Engineering Complex opened in 2015 near Pullman Square to house educational resources for Marshall&#x27;s College of Information Technology, Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering, Mathematics &amp; Computational Science, Computer Modeling &amp; Digital Imaging, Transportation Research Corporation, and Marshall University Research Corporation (MURC).

The Brad D. Smith Center for Business and Innovation opened in 2024 near Old Main to develop business ideas and projects created by Marshall University students.

Brad D. Smith Foundation Hall houses the Erickson Alumni Center, Marshall University Foundation, and Marshall University Office of Alumni Relations.

The Memorial Student Center is the student center for Marshall, named in memory of the 1970 Marshall football team. The building houses the university bookstore, restaurants and student-run organizations, as well as annual events and conventions.

The Robert C. Byrd Biotechnology Science Center is named after longtime U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd, who was a proponent of the project and helped receive funding for its construction. The first floor contains two auditoriums, six teaching laboratories, numerous lecture rooms, and other research appendages.

The Forensic Science Center houses the state&#x27;s Combined DNA Index System laboratory facility.

*Marshall University – Point Pleasant Campus
*Marshall University – South Charleston Campus

===Scholarship programs===
The Society of Yeager Scholars is the highest academic scholarship offered at Marshall University, named in honor of Chuck Yeager, the first recorded pilot to break the sound barrier. Members of the society are selected through a competitive application and interview process from high school seniors. The core curriculum is designed to assist each Yeager Scholar in developing skills in analysis, synthesis, and critical thinking. Each scholar will be expected to demonstrate superior skills in written and oral communication. To remain in the program, each student must maintain a cumulative 3.5 grade point average. Those who complete all academic requirements are awarded a Yeager medallion containing flecks of the same metal as the Bell X-1.

The John Marshall Scholars Program is an academic scholarship program that covers a majority of the cost of education for member students at Marshall. The program affords a rigorous academic program and provides a full tuition/fee waiver and stipend to students with a composite ACT score of 30 or higher who have been accepted to the university. Students must maintain a 3.5 grade point average to retain their scholarship.

==Athletics==
Marshall&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the &quot;Thundering Herd&quot;. The school colors are kelly green and white. Marshall participates in NCAA Division I (FBS for football) as a member of the Sun Belt Conference. The name Thundering Herd came from a Zane Grey novel released in 1925, and a silent movie of the same name two years later. It was originally used by &quot;The Herald-Dispatch&quot; sports editor Carl &quot;Duke&quot; Ridgley, but many other nicknames were suggested over the next thirty years including Boogercats, Big Green, Green Gobblers, Rams, and Judges. In 1965, students, alums and faculty settled on Thundering Herd in a vote, and Big Green was given to the athletic department&#x27;s fund-raising wing.

Marshall is home to 15 NCAA Division I teams that compete within the Sun Belt. Sports at the school include women&#x27;s softball, swimming and diving, tennis, volleyball, and track and field; men&#x27;s football, baseball; and teams for both genders in basketball, cross country, golf, and soccer.

Marshall began playing football in 1895 and has a long tradition as a football school. The plane crash on November 14, 1970, whose 75 victims included most of the 1970 Thundering Herd football team, continues to have a lasting impact on the university and Huntington community.

In 2020, the men&#x27;s soccer team won the National Championship after defeating Indiana, 1–0, in the 2020 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s soccer championship game.

==Student life==
Marshall is home to over 200+ student organizations and clubs.

Student media includes an on-campus radio station WMUL-FM 88.1, and The Parthenon, the student newspaper.
There are 15 chapters of fraternities and sororities on campus. Disciplinary problems became national news in 2014 when &quot;The Atlantic&quot; published an article about drug and alcohol abuse in Greek chapters on campus. In 2021, the university closed all of them temporarily after allegations of violations of COVID-19 measures.

===Campus Activities Board===
The student-run Campus Activities Board organizes free campus-wide events. Also available to students is the Marshall Artists Series, which brings Broadway, dance, music, comedy, and opera to the university, and two international film festivals. Students can obtain free tickets to athletics, Marshall Artists Series productions and to theater productions at the Joan C. Edwards Performing Arts Center.

===Campus services and residence halls===
Nicknamed The Rec, the recreation center opened in 2009. The facility features an aquatic center with a spa, 3 lap lanes, a vortex whirlpool, and a leisure area.

There are ten residence halls located on the main campus, with additional housing on the Health Science campus.

<text>John Blair Jr. (April 17, 1732 – August 31, 1800) was an American Founding Father, who signed the United States Constitution as a delegate from Virginia and was appointed an Associate Justice on the first U.S. Supreme Court by George Washington.

A Virginia lawyer since 1757, Blair represented the College of William and Mary in the House of Burgesses (while his father served on the Governor&#x27;s Council) and served in various colonial offices after giving up his local law practice. In the prelude to the American Revolutionary War, Blair had served as a commissioner of admiralty to enforce regulations promulgated by the Virginia Revolutionary Conventions, then on the committee that prepared the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Virginia Constitution of 1776. He served for over a year on the Council of State before being appointed as one of the judges of the General Court, the new Commonwealth&#x27;s first appellate court. He also served on the High Court of Chancery, which was a predecessor of the Virginia Court of Appeals (now the Virginia Supreme Court.
Blair was one of the best-trained jurists of his day. A widely respected legal scholar, he avoided the tumult of state politics, preferring to work behind the scenes. He was devoted to the idea of a permanent union of the newly independent states and was a loyal supporter of fellow Virginians James Madison and at the Constitutional Convention. While serving on the Supreme Court, he influenced the interpretation of the Constitution in a number of important decisions. Contemporaries praised Blair for his ability to penetrate to the heart of legal questions, as well as his gentleness and benevolence.

==Early life and education==
John Blair was born in Williamsburg, Colony of Virginia, in 1732, to Mary (Monro) (1726–1768) and her merchant and politician husband, John Blair. They had a large family, with ten or twelve children by various accounts, and John was the fourth child, and the eldest surviving son. His father served for decades in both houses of the colony&#x27;s legislature—as a member of the House of Burgesses before decades on the Virginia Governor&#x27;s Council and (on four occasions) as acting royal governor. His emigrant paternal grandfather, Dr. Archibald Blair, had also served as a burgess, and his brother (this man&#x27;s great-uncle), Rev. James Blair, had founded and become the first president of the College of William &amp; Mary, and at his death bequeathed much of his estate to this man&#x27;s father. His maternal grandfather was Rev. John Monro of St. John&#x27;s Parish, King William County.

As had his father, Blair attended William &amp; Mary, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in 1754. In 1755, he went to London to study law at the Middle Temple.

==Career==
Returning home to practice law, Blair was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1757 and quickly thrust into public life. He began his public career shortly after the close of the French and Indian War with his election to the seat reserved for the College of William and Mary in the House of Burgesses (1766–1799). He went on to become clerk of the Governor&#x27;s Council, the upper house of the colonial legislature (1770–1780).

Blair originally joined the moderate wing of the Patriot cause. He opposed Patrick Henry&#x27;s extremist resolutions in protest of the Stamp Act, but the dissolution of the House of Burgesses by Parliament profoundly altered his views. In response to a series of taxes on the colonies passed by Parliament, Blair joined George Washington and others in 1770 and again in 1774 to draft nonimportation agreements which pledged their supporters to cease importing British goods until the taxes were repealed. In 1775, he reacted to the British Parliament&#x27;s passage of the Intolerable Acts by joining those calling for a Continental Congress and pledging support for the people of Boston who were suffering economic hardship because of Parliament&#x27;s actions.

When the American Revolution began, Blair became deeply involved in the government of his state. He served as a member of the convention that drew up Virginia&#x27;s constitution (1776) and held a number of important committee positions, including a seat on the Committee of 28 that framed the Virginia Declaration of Rights and plan of government. He served on the Privy Council, Governor Patrick Henry&#x27;s major advisory group (1776–1778). The legislature elected him to a judgeship in the general court in 1778 and soon to the post of chief justice. He was also elected to Virginia&#x27;s high court of chancery (1780). The judicial appointments automatically made Blair a member of Virginia&#x27;s first court of appeals. On the Virginia Court of Appeals, Blair participated in &quot;The Commonwealth of Virginia v. Caton et al.&quot; (1782), which set the precedent that courts can deem legislative acts unconstitutional. The decision was a precursor to the United States Supreme Court in decision &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;.
In 1786, the legislature, recognizing Blair&#x27;s prestige as a jurist, appointed him Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s successor on a committee revising the laws of Virginia. The following year, he was appointed as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention.

On September 24, 1789, President George Washington nominated Blair for one of the five associate justice positions on the newly established U.S. Supreme Court. He was confirmed by the United States Senate two days later. Blair served on the Supreme Court from February 2, 1790, until October 25, 1795. The court&#x27;s caseload during Blair&#x27;s tenure was light, with only 13 cases decided over six years. However, Blair participated in the court&#x27;s landmark case of Chisholm v. Georgia, which is considered the first United States Supreme Court case of significance and impact.

== Freemasonry ==
Blair was a very active Freemason, and a Past Master of Williamsburg Lodge, involved in the formation of the first Grand Lodge of Virginia. The convention which was called to form the Grand Lodge was petitioned for by Williamsburg Lodge, and following their first meeting in 1777, Blair was elected the very first Grand Master of Freemasons in Virginia on October 13, 1778, in Williamsburg.

==Personal life==

He married his cousin, Jean Balfour Blair.

==Death and legacy==

Blair died in Williamsburg on August 31, 1800. He was buried at the Bruton Parish Churchyard in Williamsburg.

Blair Street in Madison, Wisconsin is named in his honor.

<doc id="560382" wikidata="Q936531" url="?curid=560382" title="Fascia">
<text>A fascia (; : fasciae or fascias; adjective fascial; ) is a generic term for macroscopic membranous bodily structures. Fasciae are classified as superficial, visceral or deep, and further designated according to their anatomical location.

The knowledge of fascial structures is essential in surgery, as they create borders for infectious processes (for example Psoas abscess) and haematoma. An increase in pressure may result in a compartment syndrome, where a prompt fasciotomy may be necessary. For this reason, profound descriptions of fascial structures are available in anatomical literature from the 19th century.

==Function==
Fasciae were traditionally thought of as passive structures that transmit mechanical tension generated by muscular activities or external forces throughout the body. An important function of muscle fasciae is to reduce friction of muscular force. In doing so, fasciae provide a supportive and movable wrapping for nerves and blood vessels as they pass through and between muscles. 

In the tradition of medical dissections it has been common practice to carefully clean muscles and other organs from their surrounding fasciae in order to study their detailed topography and function. However, this practice tends to ignore that many muscle fibers insert into their fascial envelopes and that the function of many organs is significantly altered when their related fasciae are removed. This insight contributed to several modern biomechanical concepts of the human body, in which fascial tissues take over important stabilizing and connecting functions, by distributing tensional forces across several joints in a network-like manner similar to the architectural concept of tensegrity.
Starting in 2018 this concept of the fascial tissue serving as a body-wide tensional support system has been successfully expressed as an educational model with the Fascial Net Plastination Project. 

Fascial tissues – particularly those with tendinous or aponeurotic properties – are also able to store and release elastic potential energy.

== Anatomical compartments ==

A fascial compartment is a section within the body that contains muscles and nerves and is surrounded by fascia. In the human body, the limbs can each be divided into two segments: The upper limb can be divided into the arm and the forearm and the sectional compartments of both of these – the fascial compartments of the arm and the fascial compartments of the forearm contain an anterior and a posterior compartment. The lower limbs can be divided into two segments – the leg and the thigh – and these contain the fascial compartments of the leg and the fascial compartments of the thigh.

==Clinical significance==
Fascia itself becomes clinically important when it loses stiffness, becomes too stiff, or has decreased shearing ability. When inflammatory fasciitis or trauma causes fibrosis and adhesions, fascial tissue fails to differentiate the adjacent structures effectively. This can happen after surgery, where the fascia has been incised and healing includes a scar that traverses the surrounding structures.

== Fascial Net Plastination Project ==

The Fascial Net Plastination Project (FNPP) is an anatomical research initiative spearheaded by fascia researcher Robert Schleip. The project aims to enhance the study of fascia through the technique of plastination. Led by an international team of fascia experts and anatomists, the FNPP resulted in the creation of a full-body fascia plastinate known as FR:EIA (Fascia Revealed: Educating Interconnected Anatomy). This plastinate provides a detailed view of the human fascial network, allowing for a better understanding of its structure and function as an interconnected tissue throughout the body.

FR:EIA was unveiled at the 2021 Fascia Research Congress and is currently exhibited at the Body Worlds exhibition in Berlin. This project represents a significant contribution to the visualization of fascia and has the potential to influence future research in fields such as medicine, physical therapy, and movement science.

==Terminology==
There exists some controversy about what structures are considered &quot;fascia&quot; and how they should be classified.

The current version of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists divides into:

* Fascia craniocervicalis
* Fascia trunci
** Fascia parietalis
** Fascia extraserosalis
** Fascia visceralis
* Fasciae membrorum
* Fasciae musculorum
** Fascia investiens
** Fascia propria musculi

=== Previous terminology ===
Two former, rather commonly used systems are:
* The one specified in the 1983 edition of Nomina Anatomica (NA 1983)
* The one specified in the 1997 edition of Terminologia Anatomica (TA 1997)

==== Superficial ====
Superficial fascia is the lowermost layer of the skin in nearly all of the regions of the body, that blends with the reticular dermis layer. It is present on the face, over the upper portion of the sternocleidomastoid, at the nape of the neck and overlying the breastbone. It consists mainly of loose areolar and fatty adipose connective tissue and is the layer that primarily determines the shape of a body. In addition to its subcutaneous presence, superficial fascia surrounds organs, glands and neurovascular bundles, and fills otherwise empty space at many other locations. It serves as a storage medium of fat and water; as a passageway for lymph, nerve and blood vessels; and as a protective padding to cushion and insulate.

Superficial fascia is present, but does not contain fat, in the eyelid, ear, scrotum, penis and clitoris.

Due to its viscoelastic properties, superficial fascia can stretch to accommodate the deposition of adipose that accompanies both ordinary and prenatal weight gain. After pregnancy and weight loss, the superficial fascia slowly reverts to its original level of tension.

==== Visceral ====
Visceral fascia (also called subserous fascia) suspends the organs within their cavities and wraps them in layers of connective tissue membranes. Each of the organs is covered in a double layer of fascia; these layers are separated by a thin serous membrane.
* The outermost wall of the organ is known as the parietal layer
* The skin of the organ is known as the visceral layer. The organs have specialized names for their visceral fasciae. In the brain, they are known as meninges; in the heart they are known as pericardia; in the lungs, they are known as pleurae; and in the abdomen, they are known as peritonea.

Visceral fascia is less extensible than superficial fascia. Due to its suspensory role for the organs, it needs to maintain its tone rather consistently. If it is too lax, it contributes to organ prolapse, yet if it is hypertonic, it restricts proper organ motility.

==== Deep ====
Deep fascia is a layer of dense fibrous connective tissue which surrounds individual muscles and divides groups of muscles into fascial compartments.
This fascia has a high density of elastin fibre that determines its extensibility or resilience. Deep fascia was originally considered to be essentially avascular but later investigations have confirmed a rich presence of thin blood vessels. Deep fascia is also richly supplied with sensory receptors. Examples of deep fascia are fascia lata, fascia cruris, brachial fascia, plantar fascia, thoracolumbar fascia and Buck&#x27;s fascia.

<text>A goatherd or goatherder is a person who herds goats as a vocational activity. It is similar to a shepherd who herds sheep. Goatherds are most commonly found in regions where goat populations are significant; for instance, in Africa and South Asia. Goats are typically bred as dairy or meat animals, with some breeds being shorn for wool. The top six goat industry groups in the United States include: meat (includes show), dairy (includes show, pygmy and Nigerian dwarf), fiber or hair (angora, cashmere), 4-H, industrial (weed control, hiking/pack), and biotech (see Goats in agriculture).

Companies using goats to control and eradicate leafy spurge, knapweed, and other toxic weeds have sprouted across the American West.

<text>Toto IV is the fourth studio album by American rock band Toto, released on April 8, 1982, by Columbia Records. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Rosanna&quot;, peaked at number 2 for five weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts, while the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Africa&quot;, topping the Hot 100 chart, became the group&#x27;s first and only number 1 hit. Both songs were hits in the UK as well, reaching number 12 and 3, respectively. The fourth single, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Hold You Back&quot;, also peaked within the top ten on the Hot 100, at number 10 and atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary charts for three weeks. It also went into the top 40 in the UK. With the success of &quot;Africa&quot;, the album climbed back into the top 10 in early 1983 on both sides of the Atlantic.

&quot;Toto IV&quot; received three Grammy Awards in 1983 including Album of the Year, Producer of the Year for the band, and Record of the Year for &quot;Rosanna&quot;. It reached number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts in the United States, shortly after its release. It also reached the top ten in other countries, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Japan. It was also the last Toto album to feature their original bassist David Hungate until his return in 2014 (with the release of their 2015 album &quot;Toto XIV&quot;) when he was replaced by Mike Porcaro after the band’s recording of the album, and also the final album to feature original lead vocalist Bobby Kimball until his comeback in 1998 (with the release of the 1999 album &quot;Mindfields&quot;).

==Background==
After the success of their self-titled debut, Toto struggled to sustain success on their next two albums, &quot;Hydra&quot; and &quot;Turn Back&quot;. The band was under heavy pressure from Columbia Records to deliver a hit album with their next release or be at risk of being dropped from the label.

The band went back to the formula that helped them succeed on their first album, having an album that touched on many different genres of music. They also utilized many outside musicians to help give the sound a more polished, fuller feel than they had on past albums.

This was the final album with the original Toto lineup. David Hungate, who moved to Nashville during the recording of the album, left the band to spend more time with his family. Two years later, shortly after beginning recording of their follow-up album, Bobby Kimball was fired by the band due to drug issues that were damaging his voice.

The band delayed touring after the release of the album to instead help in the production of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; album, as well as collaborating on Chicago&#x27;s comeback album &quot;Chicago 16&quot; that same year.

==Production==
Recording took place across several months in 1981 and 1982, and the band was allowed a much larger than average recording budget. At a time when most bands were using a single 24-track recorder, Toto used as many as three separate 24-track recorders simultaneously.

The multiple 24-track recorders were linked via a computerized SMPTE timecode system. One track of each machine contained the timecode synchronization signal, while 22 of the remaining 23 tracks of each reel were available for audio track recordings. (Typically, on analog 24-track recorders SMPTE was recorded on track 24, and the track next to it left blank to avoid any cross-talk or bleed over from the time code.) A significant number of tracks were copied and mixed down from those already recorded on another synchronized tape reel. This process lowered the amount of wear on the first generation tapes and helped maintain high quality sound during the extensive overdubbing and mixing process.

==Cover art==
Philip Garris&#x27;s original emblem from the &quot;Toto&quot; album was updated to show four rings since this was their fourth album. The newer looking, well-polished ring around the hilt of the sword represented their latest work. Each successive ring showed a little more wear and a few more chips which represented the band&#x27;s previous records.

<text>The Swingles are an a cappella vocal group. The Swingle Singers were originally formed in 1962 in Paris under the leadership of Ward Swingle. In 1973, Swingle disbanded the French group, and formed an English group known initially as Swingle II and later as the New Swingle Singers, before settling on the Swingles name.

==History==
=== French group ===

The Swingle Singers were formed in Paris in 1962 and directed originally by Ward Swingle (who once belonged to Mimi Perrin&#x27;s French vocal group Les Double Six). They began as session singers, mainly doing backing vocals for singers such as Charles Aznavour and Edith Piaf. Their original lineup was Anne Germain, Claude Germain, Jeanette Baucomont, Christiane Legrand, Claudine Meunier, Jean-Claude Briodin, and Jean Cussac, with Legrand (sister of Michel Legrand) the original lead soprano. The ensemble sang some jazz vocals for Michel Legrand. 

The eight session singers sang through Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; as a sight-reading exercise and found the music to have a natural swing. They recorded their first album &quot;Jazz Sébastien Bach&quot; as a present for friends and relatives. Many radio stations picked it up and this led to the group recording more albums and winning a total of five Grammy Awards. The French group typically performed and recorded with a double bass and drums as accompaniment.

In 1973, Ward Swingle disbanded the original French group when he and his family moved to England. 

=== English group ===

In England, Swingle assembled a group of singers with an emphasis moved from classical music to &quot;a cappella&quot; arrangements of madrigals and then on to other styles. This group debuted Swingle II, and performed and recorded under the name The Swingles, The New Swingle Singers, and The Swingle Singers before settling on The Swingles.

The group has remained continuously active since its formation, with departing members replaced by audition. Ward Swingle continued as a performer in the group until retiring to the United States in 1984 and taking the role of &quot;musical adviser&quot; to the Swingles until his death in 2015.

Until 2011, the group consisted of eight voices: two sopranos, two altos, two tenors and two basses. However, when alto Lucy Bailey left the group in 2011, the Swingles announced the decision not to replace her, but to continue as a seven-person line-up.

The current group performs primarily, but not exclusively, &quot;a cappella&quot; and over the decades has explored a wide range of styles, from show tunes to rock to &quot;avant garde&quot; to world folkloric music to straight ahead jazz to classical, including the entire repertoire of the original Swingle Singers. The Swingles are curators of the London A Cappella Festival, based at Kings Place.

, the members are:
*Mallika Bhagwat (soprano, India) (since April 2023)
*Scarlet Halton (alto, UK) 
*Joanna Goldsmith-Eteson (alto, UK)
*James Botcher (tenor, UK) (since September , 2024)
*Owen Butcher (tenor, UK) (since February 2024)
*Jamie Wright (baritone and vocal percussionist, UK) (since January 2020)
*Tom Hartley (bass, UK) (since June 2022)

==Performances and releases==
An early hit for the group was Bach&#x27;s &quot;Air on the G String&quot;, recorded with the Modern Jazz Quartet; it has been used as the theme tune to a popular Italian TV Show, &quot;Superquark&quot;, as well as the Swedish Children&#x27;s program, &quot;Beppes godnattstund&quot;, hosted by Beppe Wolgers. Luciano Berio wrote his postmodern symphony &quot;Sinfonia for eight voices and orchestra&quot; in 1968 with the Swingle Singers in mind (appearing on the original premiere recording with the New York Philharmonic). They also premiered Berio&#x27;s &quot;A-Ronne&quot; in 1974, which they later recorded. They also recorded Ben Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Sonnets of Desolation&quot; in 1984.

In 2005, their recording of Bach&#x27;s Prelude in F Minor was incorporated into the hit single &quot;They&quot;, by Jem Griffiths; the piece was also used in the 2006 film &quot;The Gigolos&quot;. The group&#x27;s music has a trademark sound and is used frequently on television (&quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, &quot;Glee&quot;), in movies (Bach&#x27;s Fugue in G Minor (BWV 578) in &quot;Thank You for Smoking&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Horn Concerto No. 4&quot; in &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;, Bach&#x27;s &quot;Prelude No.7 in E flat [The Well Tempered Clavier – Book 2 BWV 876]&quot; in &quot;Milk&quot;).

The English group sang with French pop star Étienne Daho on his songs &quot;Timide intimité&quot; and &quot;Soudain&quot; from his 1996 album &quot;Eden&quot;, and with the Style Council on their song &quot;The Story of Someone&#x27;s Shoe&quot; from the 1988 album &quot;Confessions of a Pop Group&quot;. They appeared several times on the BBC Television sketch show &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; in the early 1970s.

In September 2014, the French blog &quot;Dans l&#x27;ombre des studios&quot; published Swingle Singers&#x27; &quot;Pavane for a Dead Princess&quot; (Maurice Ravel), a previously unreleased 1967 recording.

<text>In analytical psychology, the shadow (also known as ego-dystonic complex, repressed id, shadow aspect, or shadow archetype) is an unconscious aspect of the personality that does not correspond with the ego ideal, leading the ego to resist and project the shadow, creating conflict with it. The shadow may be personified as archetypes which relate to the collective unconscious, such as the trickster.

==Overview==
The shadow can be thought of as the blind spot of the psyche. The repression of one&#x27;s id, while maladaptive, prevents shadow integration, the union of id and ego. While they are regarded as differing on their theories of the function of repression of id in civilization, Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung coalesced at Platonism, wherein id rejects the &quot;nomos&quot;. Persona is contrasted against the shadow. Jung regarded the shadow as unconscious – id and biography – suppressed under the superego&#x27;s ego-ideal, the way the superego wants to be. 
The shadow is projected onto one&#x27;s social environment as cognitive distortions. However, the shadow can also be regarded as &quot;roughly equivalent to the whole of the Freudian unconscious&quot;, and Jung himself asserted that &quot;the result of the Freudian method of elucidation is a minute elaboration of man&#x27;s shadow side unexampled in any previous age&quot;.

Contrary to a Freudian definition of &quot;shadow&quot;, the idea can include everything outside the light of consciousness and may be positive or negative. Because a subject can repress awareness or conceal self-threatening aspects of the self, consensus of the idea of the shadow that it is a negative function in the self, despite the extent of the repression failing to prohibit these aspects. There are positive aspects that can remain hidden in one&#x27;s shadow – especially in people with low self-esteem, anxieties, and false beliefs – with these aspects being brought to the conscious mind and exercised through analysis and therapy. It may be considered the subject&#x27;s identification with id, superseded in early childhood, though it can also be influenced by early to late childhood.

Jung wrote that if awareness of the projection of the shadow remains repressed, &quot;the projection-making factor (the Shadow archetype) then has a free hand and can realize its object – if it has one – or bring about some other situation characteristic of its power&quot;, lending the idea autonomous qualities which can have consequences on the id and the ego. These projections insulate and delude individuals in society by acting as a symbolically deployed barrier between the ego and the ego-less Real.

===Collective shadow===
The collective unconscious, a concept that states that all of humanity shares some unconscious ideals, forms a projective identification with uncertainty and feelings of helplessness along with other negative feelings. This projection frequently identifies with the figure of the Devil as the &quot;fourth&quot; aspect of the Pauline-Christian trinity, functioning as its grounding myth. This idea can be seen in other mythologies, for instance, the ancient-Egyptian-devil Set &quot;represents overwhelming affects&quot;. The collective shadow is ancestral and is carried by the collective experience of the human race (i.e., in-group and out-group: dehumanization; e.g., hate crime).

==Appearance==
Jungians believe that the shadow aspect of the Self may appear in dreams and visions (i.e., mise-en-scène), in various forms and typically &quot;appears as a person of the same sex as that of the dreamer.&quot; The shadow&#x27;s appearance and role depend greatly on the living experience of the individual because much of the shadow develops in the individual&#x27;s mind rather than simply being inherited from the collective unconscious and is important in the Jungian approach to dream interpretation. Nevertheless, some Jungians maintain that &quot;the shadow contains, besides the personal shadow, the shadow of society [...] fed by the neglected and repressed collective values.&quot;

Jung also made the suggestion that the shadow may be made up of many layers. The top layers contain the meaningful flow and manifestations of direct personal experiences. These are made unconscious in the individual by such things as the change of attention from one thing to another, simple forgetfulness, or a repression. Underneath these specific layers, however, are the archetypes which form the psychic contents of all human experiences. Jung described this deeper layer as &quot;a psychic activity which goes on independently of the conscious mind and is not dependent even on the upper layers of the unconscious – untouched, and perhaps untouchable – by personal experience.&quot;

==Encountering the shadow==
As the shadow is a part of the unconscious, a method called Shadow work is practiced through &quot;active imagination&quot; with daydreaming and meditation – the experience is then mediated by dialectical interpretation through narrative and art (pottery, poetry, drawing, dancing, singing, etc.); analysts perform dreamwork on analysands, using &quot;amplification&quot; to raise the unconscious to conscious awareness. Jung uses the term Nekyia to describe the descent into darkness, where the ego fades.

The eventual encounter with the shadow plays a central part in the process of individuation. Jung considered that &quot;the course of individuation [...] exhibits a certain formal regularity. Its signposts and milestones are various archetypal symbols&quot; marking its stages; and of these &quot;the first stage leads to the experience of the shadow.&quot; If &quot;the breakdown of the persona constitutes the typical Jungian moment both in therapy and in development,&quot; it is this that opens the road to the shadow within, coming about when &quot;beneath the surface a person is suffering from a deadly boredom that makes everything seem meaningless and empty...as if the initial encounter with the Self casts a dark shadow ahead of time.&quot; Jung considered as a perennial danger in life that &quot;the more consciousness gains in clarity, the more monarchic becomes its content...the king constantly needs the renewal that begins with a descent into his own darkness&quot; – his shadow – which the &quot;dissolution of the persona&quot; sets in motion.

&quot;The shadow personifies everything that the subject refuses to acknowledge about himself&quot;, whether consciously or unconsciously, and represents &quot;a tight passage, a narrow door, whose painful constriction no one is spared who goes down to the deep well.&quot;[If and when] an individual makes an attempt to see his shadow, he becomes aware of (and often ashamed of) those qualities and impulses he denies in himself but can plainly see in others – such things as egotism, mental laziness, and sloppiness; unreal fantasies, schemes, and plots; carelessness and cowardice; inordinate love of money and possessions...The dissolution of the persona and the launch of the individuation process also brings with it &quot;the danger of falling victim to the shadow ... the black shadow which everybody carries with him, the inferior and therefore hidden aspect of the personality&quot; – resulting in a merger with the shadow.

==Merging with the shadow==
Jung considered merging with the shadow as typically bad, viewing it as the process of the suppressed identity overwriting or controlling the ego. According to Jung, the shadow sometimes overwhelms a person&#x27;s actions; for example, when the conscious mind is shocked, confused, or paralyzed by indecision. &quot;A man who is possessed by his shadow is always standing in his own light and falling into his own traps...living below his own level.&quot; Hence, in terms of the story of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, &quot;it must be Jekyll, the conscious personality, who integrates the shadow ... and &quot;not&quot; vice versa. Otherwise the conscious becomes the slave of the autonomous shadow.&quot; 

Individuation inevitably raises that very possibility as it further separates the ego from the collective unconsciousness. As the process continues, and &quot;the libido leaves the bright upper world... sinks back into its own depths... below, in the shadows of the unconscious.&quot; so too what comes to the forefront is &quot;what was hidden under the mask of conventional adaptation: the shadow&quot;, with the result that &quot;ego and shadow are no longer divided but are brought together in an – admittedly precarious – unity.&quot;

The effect of such &quot;confrontation with the shadow produces at first a dead balance, a standstill that hampers moral decisions and makes convictions ineffective ... &quot;nigredo&quot;, &quot;tenebrositas&quot;, chaos, melancholia.&quot; Consequently, as Jung knew from personal experience: &quot;In this time of descent – one, three, seven years, more or less – genuine courage and strength are required&quot;, with no certainty of emergence. Nevertheless, Jung remained of the opinion that while &quot;no one should deny the danger of the descent [...] every descent is followed by an ascent&quot;, and assimilation of – rather than possession by – the shadow becomes a possibility.

==Assimilation of the shadow==
Assimilation is the process of acknowledging the shadow and possibly incorporating parts of it into the ego. Jungians believe this may lead to a numinous experience, while anchoring to the &quot;numinosum&quot; effect without reality testing can lead to ego inflation (qv., archetypal possession).

In analytical psychology, the struggle for the superego is to retain awareness of the shadow, but not to become it or be controlled by it. &quot;Non-identification demands considerable moral effort [which] prevents a descent into that darkness&quot;; and though &quot;the conscious mind is liable to be submerged at any moment in the unconscious...understanding acts like a life-saver. It integrates the unconscious.&quot; This reincorporates the shadow into the personality, producing a stronger, wider consciousness than before. &quot;Assimilation of the shadow gives a man body, so to speak,&quot; thereby providing a launchpad for further individuation. &quot;The integration of the shadow, or the realization of the personal unconscious, marks the first stage in the analytic process... without it a recognition of anima and animus is impossible.&quot; Conversely, &quot;to the degree in which the shadow is recognised and integrated, the problem of the anima, i.e., of relationship, is constellated,&quot; and becomes the centre of the individuation quest.

Carolyn Kaufman wrote that &quot;in spite of its function as a reservoir for human darkness – or perhaps because of this – the shadow is the seat of creativity;&quot; so that for some, it may be that &quot;the dark side of his being, his sinister shadow...represents the true spirit of life as against the arid scholar.&quot; Nevertheless, Jungians warn that &quot;acknowledgement of the shadow must be a continuous process throughout one&#x27;s life;&quot; and even after the focus of individuation has moved on to the animus/anima, &quot;the later stages of shadow integration&quot; will continue to take place – the grim &quot;process of washing one&#x27;s dirty linen in private,&quot; of accepting one&#x27;s shadow.

<text>Fang Lizhi (; February 12, 1936 – April 6, 2012) was a Chinese astrophysicist, vice-president of the University of Science and Technology of China, and activist whose liberal ideas inspired the pro-democracy student movement of 1986–87 and, finally, the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Fang was considered as one of the leaders of the New Enlightenment in the 1980s. Because of his activism, he was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party in January 1987. For his work, Fang was a recipient of the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights Award in 1989, given each year. He was elected an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1980, but his position was revoked after 1989.

==Life and career in China==
Fang was born on 12 February 1936 in Beijing. His father worked on the railway. In 1948, a year before the People&#x27;s Liberation Army took over the city, as a student of the Beijing No. 4 High School, he joined an underground youth organization that was associated with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). One of his extracurricular activities was assembling radio receivers from used parts.

In 1952, he enrolled in the Physics Department at Peking University, where he met his future wife, Li Shuxian (). Both Fang and Li were among the top students in their class. After graduating, he joined the CCP, started working at the Institute of Modern Physics and became involved in China&#x27;s secret atomic bomb program, while Li stayed at Peking University as a junior faculty member.

In 1957, during the Hundred Flowers Campaign, people were strongly encouraged by the CCP to openly express their opinions and criticisms. As party members, Li, Fang and another person in the physics department planned to write a letter to the party to offer their suggestions on education. This letter was still unfinished by the time the Hundred Flowers Campaign abruptly came to an end and the Anti-Rightist Campaign started. The opinions and criticisms solicited during the earlier campaign were then interpreted as &quot;attacks on the party&quot;, and those who had expressed such opinions were labelled &quot;rightist&quot; and persecuted. Although no one knew about the unfinished letter, out of loyalty to the party, Fang, Li and their friend confessed to writing it; Li also confessed her doubts about the party. Li was expelled from the CCP, and sentenced to hard labour in Zhaitang, a town near Beijing. Fang was not immediately expelled from the party, because he played a lesser role in writing the letter, and also because he had left Peking University, where the punishment was particularly severe. However, he was removed from the nuclear program and sent to do hard labour in Zanhuang, Hebei province from December 1957 to August 1958. Out of political pressure, Li and Fang put their relationship on hold until early 1959, when Fang was also expelled from the CCP. In August 1958, Fang was reassigned to the faculty of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), which was located in Beijing at the time. In 1961 he married Li, who remained a faculty member of Peking University. In spite of his experience in the anti-Rightist campaign, Fang published an article in the &quot;Guangming Daily&quot;, encouraging the independent thinking of students.

Fang published his first research paper on nuclear physics in &quot;Acta Physica Sinica 17&quot;, p. 57 (1961) under the pseudonym Wang Yunran, since as a rightist he was not entitled to publish research papers. Later, on the recommendation of Qian Linzhao, he became an associated member of a research group led by Li Yinyuan at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Since Li&#x27;s group was at a different institute, this arrangement took advantage of a loophole in management rules, allowing him to publish papers under his own name. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Fang conducted research in particle physics, solid state physics and laser physics. By 1965, he had published 13 research papers and was considered one of the most productive physics researchers in China. That year, as part of the effort of cleansing Beijing of &quot;undesirable elements&quot;, Fang was to be removed from the faculty of USTC and sent to work in an electronics factory in Liaoning province. Learning about this, vice president Yan Jici intervened on Fang&#x27;s behalf; he pleaded the case to the party secretary of USTC at the time, Liu Da, who cancelled the cleansing order for Fang and other faculty members of USTC.

Academic activities were interrupted when the Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966. In 1969, along with other universities and research institutes, USTC was ordered to be evacuated out of Beijing, ostensibly in anticipation of an impending invasion by the Soviet Union. USTC was moved to Hefei, the capital of Anhui Province, where it remains to this day. Upon arriving in Hefei in 1969, Fang, along with other &quot;problematic members&quot; of the faculty, were sent to do hard labour for &quot;re-education by the worker class&quot; in a coal mine. Fang secretly brought with him one physics book, the &quot;Classical Theory of Fields&quot; by Lev Landau and learned the theory of general relativity by reading this book in the evening. Later, in 1971, along with a number of other faculty members, he was assigned to do labour work in a brick factory, which produced the bricks for constructing the new USTC campus buildings.

==Research in astrophysics and cosmology==
In 1972, the worst chaos of the Cultural Revolution was over and scientific research resumed. Fang found an opportunity to read some recent astrophysics papers in western journals, and soon wrote his first paper on cosmology, &quot;A Cosmological Solution in Scalar-tensor Theory with Mass and Blackbody Radiation&quot;, which was published on the journal &quot;Wu Li&quot; (Physics), Vol. 1, 163 (1972). This was the first modern cosmological research paper in mainland China. Fang assembled a group of young faculty members of USTC around him to conduct astrophysics research.

At the time, conducting research on relativity theory and cosmology in China was very risky politically, because these theories were considered to be &quot;idealistic&quot; theories in contradiction with dialectical materialism, a central component of the Communist Party&#x27;s ideology. According to the dialectical materialism philosophy, both time and space must be infinite, while the Big Bang theory allows the possibility of the finiteness of space and time. During the Cultural Revolution, campaigns were waged against Albert Einstein and the Theory of Relativity in Beijing and Shanghai. Once Fang published his theory, some of the critics of the Theory of Relativity, especially a group based in Shanghai, prepared to attack Fang politically. However, by this time the &quot;leftist&quot; line was declining in the Chinese academia. Professor Dai Wensai, the most well-known Chinese astronomer at the time and chair of the Astronomy Department of Nanjing University, also supported Fang. Many of the members of the &quot;Theory of Relativity Criticism Group&quot; changed to study the theory and conduct research in it. Subsequently, Fang was regarded as the father of cosmological research in China.

Fang published a large number of papers on astrophysics and cosmology. In the late 1970s, he and his group used the luminosity of selected radio quasars to measure the Hubble diagram, and with data available at the time, suggested that the universe may be closed (Fang &quot;et al.&quot;, &quot;Acta Astronomica Sinica&quot; 17, 134 (1977)). This work was noticed by researchers outside China; a &quot;Nature&quot; article noted that it obtained similar results to, but appeared earlier than, the paper by Davidsen &quot;et al.&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot; 269, 203 (1977). Fang also carried out research on topics including neutron stars, black holes, inflation and quantum cosmology. He soon gained international recognition, and as China began to open up in the late 1970s, he was invited to international conferences outside the country. In 1985, together with H. Sato of Kyoto University, Japan, Fang won the first prize of the Gravity Research Foundation essay competition by proposing that the periodic distribution of quasars observed can be explained if the Universe is multiply-connected, i.e. has a non-trivial topology.

He was elected as the youngest member of the Chinese Academy of Science in 1980. His membership was, however, revoked after the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989. He helped promote international academic exchange in China. Together with Remo Ruffini, he organized the first major international scientific conference in China: the 3rd Marcel Grossmann meeting in 1982. During this meeting, Tsvi Piran and T.G. Horowitz became the first two Israeli scientists to enter the People&#x27;s Republic of China; at the time, there were no diplomatic relations between China and Israel. He invited Stephen Hawking to visit China in 1985, and organized the International Astronomical Union conference IAU-124 on &quot;Observational Cosmology&quot; in Beijing in 1986.

Fang also trained many younger colleagues and students in the field of astrophysics and cosmology; he was considered an excellent teacher. Fang and Li coauthored &quot;Introduction to Mechanics&quot;, an introductory book on Newtonian mechanics and special theory of relativity. This book has been considered a classic by many teachers and students, although few students are aware of it in recent years. Fang was also the first scientist in China to write popular accounts of contemporary astrophysical developments, such as cosmology and black holes. Fang&#x27;s book, &quot;Creation of the Universe&quot; (Yuzhou de chuangsheng in Chinese) which was published in 1987, introduced basic cosmological ideas, and influenced a large number of physics and astronomy students growing up in the 1980s in China.

==Political activism==
During the Anti-Rightist Campaign, Fang was expelled from the Chinese Communist Party for his &quot;reactionary activities&quot;, viz. publishing an article critical of the government&#x27;s policies on science education.

He was rehabilitated after the reform of China in late 1970s, and resumed his party membership. During this time, he held many academic positions, including the director of the astrophysics research group of USTC, and director of the science history research group, chief editor of the USTC academic journal, chair of the Chinese society of gravity and relativistic astrophysics. In 1984, Fang was appointed as the vice president of the USTC under president Guan Weiyan. Fang was very active in this role; for example he helped to set up the telex service for USTC. He was very popular among the students. Fang also begin to write essays for publication in popular magazines, and give lectures on a variety of topics in universities, though usually not in USTC. Many such essays and lectures expressed his liberal view on politics, reflections on history, and criticisms on CCP dogma. He also emphasized social responsibility of intellectuals. In late 1986, Fang, together with Xu Liangying and Liu Binyan, wrote letters to a number of well-known &quot;Rightists&quot; from the 1957 Anti-Rightist campaign, suggesting a meeting in memory of that event.

In December 1986, college students demonstrated in over a dozen Chinese cities in demanding greater economic and political freedoms. Fang was against the student demonstration, believing it would be suppressed by the CCP; he tried to persuade the USTC students not to go off-campus. After two straight weeks of student demonstrations, believing that the student movement was a result of &quot;bourgeois liberalization&quot;, Deng Xiaoping named three Communist Party members to be expelled: Fang, Liu Binyan and Wang Ruowang. Deng directed then-CCP General Secretary Hu Yaobang to expel them from the Party, but Hu refused. Because of his refusal, Hu Yaobang was dismissed from his position as General Secretary in January 1987, effectively ending his period of influence within the Chinese government.

Fang was again expelled from Chinese Communist Party in January 1987, and removed from his position as the vice president of the university. He was moved to Beijing as a research scientist at the Beijing Astronomical Observatory, now a part of the National Astronomical Observatory of China, and reunited with his wife, Li Shuxian, a professor at Peking University. He gained fame and notoriety after his essays were collected by the Chinese Communist Party and distributed to many of its regional offices, with the directive to its members to criticize the essays. 

==1989 democracy movement and exile==
In February 1989, Fang mobilized a number of well known intellectuals to write an open letter to Deng Xiaoping, requesting amnesty for the human right activist Wei Jingsheng who was then in prison. His wife, Li, was elected to become the people&#x27;s representative of the Haidian District where Peking University is located. Fang and his wife had exchanged ideas about Chinese politics with some students of Peking University, including Wang Dan and Liu Gang. Some of those students became student leaders during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, though Fang and Li did not actively participate in the protest itself.

During U.S. President George H.W. Bush&#x27;s February 1989 visit to China, the U.S. embassy invited Fang to a banquet that Bush was hosting at the Sheraton Great Wall Hotel in honor of Deng Xiaoping. Deng had a negative view of Fang. Public Security stopped Fang on his way to the banquet and prevented him from attending.

On June 5, 1989, the day after the government cracked down on the Tiananmen Square protests, Fang and Li sought asylum at the U.S. embassy in Beijing, accompanied by U.S. academic Perry Link. Fang and Li were initially turned away, but Jeffrey A. Bader, then acting director of the Office of Chinese and Mongolian Affairs at the State Department, used very strong language to order the embassy to reverse their decision. That night, Fang and his family were smuggled into the embassy in the back of a van. The Chinese government put Fang and Li at the top of the &quot;wanted&quot; list of the people involved in the protest. During his time in the U.S. embassy, Fang wrote an essay titled &quot;The Chinese Amnesia&quot;, criticizing the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s repression of human rights and the outside world&#x27;s turning a blind eye to it. Fang&#x27;s continued presence in the US Embassy following the protests became, according to U.S. Ambassador James Lilley, &quot;a living symbol of our [US] conflict with China over human rights.&quot;

Fang and his wife remained in the US Embassy until 25 June 1990, when they were allowed by Chinese authorities to leave the embassy and board a U.S. Air Force C-135 transport plane to Britain. This resolution partly came about after confidential negotiations between Henry Kissinger, acting on behalf of US President George H. W. Bush, and Deng. Other factors were a false confession by Fang, an attempted intervention by US National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, and an offer from the Japanese government to resume loans to the PRC in return for the resolution of &quot;the Fang Lizhi problem.&quot;

In 1989, he was a recipient of the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. In 1991, he gave a conference on the issue of Tibet in New York, one of the first open dialogues between Chinese and Tibetans. He also was an advisor for the International Campaign for Tibet.

==Later life in the US==
After some time at Cambridge University and Princeton, Fang later moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he worked as Professor of Physics at the University of Arizona. In campus speeches, Fang spoke on topics such as human rights and democracy as matters of social responsibility. He also served as a board member and co-chair of the New York-based organization Human Rights in China.

Fang continued to do research in astrophysics and cosmology. He published research papers even during his stay in the US Embassy in Beijing. His later research includes the study of non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, Lyman alpha forest, application of wavelets in cosmology, turbulence in intergalactic medium, and the 21cm radiation during the Reionization. He continued to train students and younger scientists who visited him from China and was very active in research to the end of his life, publishing multiple research papers each year.

==Death==

He died in his home in Tucson on April 6, 2012, aged 76, from undisclosed causes. He was buried at East Lawn Palms Mortuary &amp; Cemetery on April 14.

<doc id="560404" wikidata="Q540530" url="?curid=560404" title="Luther Martin">
<text>Luther Martin (February 20, 1748, New Brunswick, New Jersey – July 10, 1826, New York, New York) was a Founding Father of the United States, framer of the U.S. Constitution, politician, lawyer, and slave owner. Martin was a delegate from Maryland to the Constitutional Convention in 1787, but did not sign the Constitution, having left the convention early because he felt the document as proposed violated states&#x27; rights. In the months following the convention, he was a leading Anti-Federalist, along with Patrick Henry and George Mason, whose collective efforts led to the passage of the Bill of Rights. 

== Early life ==
Martin was an early advocate of American independence from Great Britain. In the fall of 1774, as a resident of Somerset County, Maryland, he served on the county&#x27;s patriot committee and in December attended a convention of the Province of Maryland in Annapolis, which had been called to consider the recommendations of the Continental Congress. He went to the College of New Jersey (Princeton) and graduated with honors in 1766.

==Constitutional convention==
In 1785, he was elected to the Confederation Congress by the Maryland General Assembly, but his numerous public and private duties prevented him from traveling to Philadelphia. Martin was elected as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in Philadelphia. When he arrived on June 9, 1787, he expressed suspicion of the secrecy rule imposed on the proceedings. He also opposed the creation of a government in which the large states would dominate the small ones, he consistently sided with the small states, helping to formulate the New Jersey Plan and voting against the Virginia Plan. On June 27, Martin spoke for more than three hours in opposition to the Virginia Plan&#x27;s proposal for proportionate representation in both houses of the legislature. 

He was known for his warm opposition to the development of a strong central government. He was known for his ability to talk and as stated by William Pierce &quot;he was educated for the Bar... and he never speaks without tiring the patience of all who hear him.&quot;

Martin believed the legislative branch should be unicameral, proposed limiting the standing army during peacetime, and argued that the Convention had exceeded its powers by creating a national government when they were sent to Philadelphia &quot;for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.&quot;

Martin served on the committee formed to seek a compromise on representation, where he supported the case for equal numbers of delegates in at least one house. Before the convention closed, he became convinced that the new government would have too much power over state governments and would threaten individual rights. Failing to find any support for a bill of rights, Martin and another Maryland delegate, John Francis Mercer, walked out of the convention on September 3, 1787. He was one of the most vocal opponents of slavery at the Constitutional Convention, denouncing it as &quot;an odious bargain with sin&quot; that was &quot;inconsistent with the principles of the revolution and dishonorable to the American character.&quot;

==Ratification fight==

In November 1787, in a speech to the Maryland House of Delegates, he assailed the Constitutional Convention for what it was attempting to do and for how it was going about the job. He broke the pledge to secrecy under which the convention had met and informed the Maryland legislators that the convention had violated its instructions to meet &quot;for the sole and express purpose of revising&quot; the Articles of Confederation. Instead, convention delegates had taken it upon themselves to make a fresh start by creating an entirely new system of government. To Martin, such an effort was akin to launching a coup d&#x27;état. George Washington and Benjamin Franklin had backed the change of direction of the convention, but, Martin said, we should not &quot;suffer our eyes to be so far dazzled by the splendor of names, as to run blindfolded into what may be our destruction.&quot;

In an address to the Maryland House of Delegates in November 1787 and in numerous newspaper articles, Martin attacked the proposed new form of government and continued to fight ratification of the Constitution through 1788. He lamented the ascension of the national government over the states and condemned what he saw as unequal representation in Congress. He owned six slaves of his own, but he opposed including slaves in determining representation (most slave owners supported counting slaves for the purposes of determining representation because this would increase the power of Slave States), and he believed that the absence of a jury in the U.S. Supreme Court gravely endangered freedom. At the convention, Martin complained, the aggrandizement of particular states and individuals often had been pursued more avidly than the welfare of the country. The assumption of the term &quot;federal&quot; by those who favored a &quot;national&quot; government also irritated Martin.

Martin served as a delegate to the Maryland State Convention of 1788, to vote whether Maryland should ratify the proposed Constitution of the United States. Most of the delegates at the convention ignored Martin&#x27;s warnings. In April 1788, the majority of the delegates voted to ratify the Constitution, making Maryland the seventh state to do so. In June, when New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify, the required threshold had been reached, and the new Constitution took effect. Three years later, the first 10 amendments were added.

==Legal career==
In the beginning of the 19th century, Martin was defense counsel in two controversial national cases. In the first case, Martin won an acquittal for his close friend Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in his impeachment trial in 1805. Two years later, Martin was one of Aaron Burr&#x27;s defense lawyers when Burr stood trial for treason in 1807.

After a record 28 consecutive years as state attorney general, Martin resigned in December 1805. In 1813, he became chief judge of the court of oyer and terminer for the City and County of Baltimore. He was reappointed attorney general of Maryland in 1818, and, in 1819, he argued Maryland&#x27;s position in the landmark Supreme Court case &quot;McCulloch v. Maryland&quot;. The plaintiffs were represented by Daniel Webster, William Pinkney and William Wirt.

Martin&#x27;s fortunes declined dramatically in his last years. Alcoholism, illness, and poverty weighed heavily on Martin, taking their toll as he aged. By the mid-1820s, he was subsisting on a special tax imposed on Maryland lawyers solely for his personal support. Eventually, he was taken in by Burr. By this time, detestation of Thomas Jefferson, his one-time decentralist ally, led Martin to embrace the Federalist Party, in apparent repudiation of everything he had argued for so strenuously. Paralysis, which had struck in 1819, forced him to retire as Maryland&#x27;s attorney general in 1822.

== Death and legacy ==

On July 10, 1826, at the age of 78, Martin died in Burr&#x27;s home in New York City and was buried in an unmarked grave in St. John&#x27;s churchyard. His death came six days after the deaths on July 4 of Jefferson and John Adams.

Martin married Maria Cresap (daughter of Captain Michael Cresap) on Christmas Day 1783. Of their five children, three daughters lived to adulthood. 

An extended display of his eloquence and volubility appears in &quot;Modern Gratitude in Five Numbers: Addressed to Richard Raynall Keene, Esq. Concerning a Family Marriage&quot; (1802)—a closely documented, fiercely argued (and partly autobiographical) denunciation of a former protégé who, against Martin&#x27;s express wishes, had wooed and married Martin&#x27;s daughter Eleonora.

<text>The Tijjani order () is a Sufi order of Sunni Islam named after Ahmad al-Tijani. It originated in the Algeria but now more widespread in Maghreb, West Africa, particularly in Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania, Mali, Guinea, Niger, Chad, Ghana, Northern and Southwestern Nigeria and some parts of Sudan. The Tijāniyyah order is also present in the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in India. Its adherents are called Tijānī (spelled &quot;Tijaan&quot; or &quot;Tiijaan&quot; in Wolof, &quot;Tidiane&quot; or &quot;Tidjane&quot; in French). Tijānīs place great importance on culture and education and emphasize the individual adhesion of the disciple (&quot;murid&quot;). To become a member of the order, one must receive the Tijānī &quot;wird&quot;, or a sequence of holy phrases to be repeated twice daily, from a &quot;muqaddam&quot;, or representative of the order.

==History and spread of the order==
===Foundation of the order===
Ahmad al-Tijani (1737–1815) was born in Aïn Madhi in Algeria and died in Fes, Morocco. He received his religious education in Mostaganem, Algeria. Inspired by other saints he founded the Tijānī order in the 1780s; sources vary as to the exact date between 1781 and 1784.

===Expansion in West Africa===
The order has become the largest Sufi order in West Africa and continues to expand rapidly. It was brought to southern Mauritania around 1789 by Muḥammad al-Ḥāfiẓ of the &#x27;Idaw `Ali tribe, which was known for its many Islamic scholars and leaders and was predominantly Qādirī at the time. Nearly the entire tribe became Tijānī during Muḥammad al-Ḥāfiẓ&#x27;s lifetime, and the tribe&#x27;s influence would facilitate the Tijāniyya&#x27;s rapid expansion to sub-Saharan Africa.

Muḥammad al-Ḥāfiẓ&#x27;s disciple Sidi Mawlūd Vāl initiated the 19th-century Fulɓe leader Omar Saidou Tall and the Fulɓe cleric ʿAbd al-Karīm al-Nāqil from Futa Jalon (now Guinea) into the order. After receiving instruction from Muḥammad al-Ghālī from 1828 to 1830 in Mecca, Umar Tall was appointed Caliph (successor or head representative) of Aḥmed al-Tijānī for all of the Western Sudan (Western sub-Saharan Africa). Umar Tall then led a holy war against what he saw as corrupt regimes in the area, resulting in the large but fleeting Toucouleur Empire in Eastern Senegal and Mali. While Omar Saidou Tall&#x27;s political empire soon gave way to French colonialism, the more long-standing result was to spread Islam and the Tijānī Order through much of what is now Senegal, Guinea, and Mali (see Robinson, 1985).

In Senegal&#x27;s Wolof country, especially the northern regions of Kajoor and the Kingdom of Jolof, the Tijānī Order was spread primarily by Malick Sy, born in 1855 near Dagana. In 1902, he founded a zāwiya or religious center in Tivaouane, which became a center for Islamic education and culture under his leadership. Upon Malick Sy&#x27;s death in 1922, his son Ababacar Sy became the first Caliph. Serigne Mansour Sy became the present Caliph in 1997, upon the death of Abdoul Aziz Sy. The Mawlid or &quot;Gàmmu&quot;, the celebration of the birth of Muhammad, of Tivaouane gathers many followers each year.

The &quot;house&quot; or branch of Tivaouane is not the only branch of the Tijānī order in Senegal. The Tijānī order was spread to the south by another jihadist, Màbba Jaxu Ba, a contemporary of Umar Tall who founded a similar Islamic state in Senegal&#x27;s Saalum area. After Màbba was defeated and killed at The Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune fighting against Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof, his state crumbled but the Tijāniyya remained the predominant Sufi order in the region, and Abdoulaye Niass (1840–1922) became the most important representative of the order in the Saalum, having immigrated southward from the Jolof and, after exile in The Gambia due to tensions with the French, returned to establish a zāwiya in the city of Kaolack.

The branch founded by Abdoulaye Niass&#x27;s son, Ibrahim Niass, in the Kaolack suburb of Medina Baye in 1930, has become by far the largest and most visible Tijānī branch around the world today. Ibrahima Niass&#x27;s teaching that all disciples, and not only specialists, can attain a direct mystical knowledge of God through &quot;tarbiyyah rūhiyyah&quot; (mystical education) has struck a chord with millions worldwide. This branch, known as the &quot;Tijāniyyah Ibrāhīmiyyah&quot; or the &quot;Faydah&quot; (&quot;Flood&quot;), is most concentrated in Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Niger, and Mauritania, and has a growing presence in the United States and Europe. Most Tijānī web sites and international organizations are part of this movement. Ibrahim Niass&#x27; late grandson and former imam of Medina Baye, Hassan Cissé, has thousands of American disciples and has founded a large educational and developmental organization, the African American Islamic Institute, in Medina Baye with branches in other parts of the world.

Another Senegalese &quot;house,&quot; in Medina-Gounass, Senegal (to the west of the Niokolo Koba park) was created by Mamadou Saidou Ba.
Still another in Thienaba, near Thiès, was founded by the disciple of a famous marabout of Futa Tooro, Amadou Sekhou.

The Ḥamāliyya (Ḥamālliyya) branch, founded by Shaykh Hamallah, is centered in Nioro, Mali, and is also present in Senegal, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Niger. One of its most prominent members is the novelist and historian Amadou Hampâté Bâ, who preserved and advocated the teachings of Tierno Bokar Salif Taal (Cerno Bokar Salif Taal), the &quot;Sage of Banjagara&quot;. (See Louis Brenner, 1984, 2000.)

It was Cherno Muhammadou Jallow, along with Sheikh Oumar Futi Taal, who first received the tarikha Tijaniyya in the Senegambia region. Cherno Muhammadou waited for the tarikha for over twelve years in Saint Louis Senegal, where Sheikh Oumar Futi Taal sent his student Cherno Abubakr. He (Cherno Muhammadou) started spreading it in the Senegambia region. Through oral history, it is that said he (Cherno Muhammadou) passed it to twelve disciples. These disciples range from Mam Mass Kah of Medina Mass Kah, Abdoulaye Niass of Medina Kaolock, Cherno Alieu, Deme of NDiaye Kunda Senegal, Cherno Alieu, Diallo of Djanet in Kolda, to name a few. Through these disciples the tarikha spread through the Senegambia region and beyond. Most of these disciples today have loads of followers and all of them are doing the Laazim daily. Cherno Muhammadou passed it to his son Cherno Omar, who later passed to his son Cherno Muhammadou. Baba Jallow later went on looking for his grandfather (Cherno Muhammadou Jallow), whom he later found in the Casamance. After discovering his grandfather&#x27;s grave, Cherno Baba created a community and named it Sobouldeh and started an annual Ziarre, where thousands converge to honor him yearly.

==Practices==
Members of the Tijānī order distinguish themselves by a number of practices. Upon entering the order, one receives the Tijānī wird from a &quot;muqaddam&quot; or representative of the order. The &quot;muqaddam&quot; explains to the initiate the duties of the order, which include keeping the basic tenets of Islam including the five Five Pillars, to honor and respect one&#x27;s parents, and not to follow another Sufi order in addition to the Tijāniyya. Initiates are to pronounce the Tijānī wird (a process that usually takes ten to fifteen minutes) every morning and afternoon. The wird is a formula that includes repetitions of the shahada, istighfar, and a prayer for Muḥammad called the &quot;Salat al-Fatih&quot; &quot;Prayer of the Opener&quot;. They are also to participate in the wazifah, a similar formula that is chanted as a group, often at a mosque or zāwiya once on a daily basis, as well as in the Haylalat al-Jum&#x27;ah, another formula chanted among other disciples on Friday afternoon before the sun down.

Additionally, disciples in many areas organize regular meetings, often on Thursday evenings or before or after Waẓīfa and Hailalat al-Jum&#x27;ah to engage in &quot;dhikr Allāh&quot;, or remembrance of God. In such meetings, poems praising God, Muhammad, Aḥmed at-Tijānī, or another religious leader may be interspersed with the dhikr. Such meetings may involve simple repetition as a group or call-response, in which one or more leaders lead the chant and others repeat or otherwise respond.

Occasionally, a group of disciples, known in Senegal as a &quot;daayira&quot;, from Arabic &quot;dā&#x27;irah&quot;, or &quot;circle&quot;, may organize a religious conference, where they will invite one or more well known speakers or chanters to speak on a given theme, such as the life of Muḥammad or another religious leader, a particular religious obligation such as fasting during Ramadan, or the nature of God.

The most important communal event of the year for most Tijānī groups is the Mawlid, known in Wolof as the &quot;Gàmmu&quot; (a borrowed term from the ancient Serer religious festival of &quot;Gamo&quot; or &quot;Gamou&quot; of the Serer people, from the Serer term  &quot;Gamahou&quot; or &quot;Gamohou&quot;), or the celebration of the birth of Muḥammad, which falls on the night of the 12th of the Islamic month of Rabīʿ al-&#x27;Awwal (which means the night before the 12th, as Islamic dates start at sundown and not at midnight). Most major Tijānī religious centers organize a large Mawlid event once a year, and hundreds of thousands of disciples attend the largest ones (in Tivaouane, Kaolack, Prang, Kiota, Kano, Fadama, etc.) Throughout the year, local communities organize smaller Mawlid celebrations. These meetings usually go from about midnight until shortly after dawn and include hours of dhikr and poetry chanting and speeches about the life of Muḥammad.

<doc id="560414" wikidata="Q953939" url="?curid=560414" title="The Petrified Forest">
<text>The Petrified Forest is a 1936 American crime drama film directed by Archie Mayo and based on Robert E. Sherwood&#x27;s 1934 drama of the same name. The motion picture stars Leslie Howard, Bette Davis and Humphrey Bogart. The screenplay was written by Delmer Daves and Charles Kenyon, and adaptations were later performed on radio and television. The film is set in Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. According to Variety, Warner Bros. filmed two endings. Howard&#x27;s character dies in one and survives in the other. In May 1945, Warner Bros. released another film based on Sherwood&#x27;s play, &quot;Escape in the Desert.&quot; It pits a Dutch flyer walking across country to San Francisco and others against a bunch of escaped Nazi POWs.

==Plot==

In the midst of the Great Depression, Alan Squier, a failed British writer, now a disillusioned, penniless drifter, wanders into a roadside diner in the remote town of Black Mesa, Arizona, at the edge of the Petrified Forest. The diner is run by Jason Maple, his daughter Gabrielle, and Gramp, Jason&#x27;s father, who regales anyone who will listen with stories of his adventures in the Old West with such characters as Billy the Kid.

Gabrielle&#x27;s mother, a French war bride who fell in love with Jason when he was a young, handsome American serviceman, left her &quot;dull defeated man&quot; after World War I and moved back to France when Gabrielle was a baby. She now sends poetry to Gabrielle, who dreams of moving to Bourges, where her parents first met, to become an artist. Alan tells his story—how he wrote one novel, then lived in France for eight years with his publisher&#x27;s wife, trying to write another—and Gabrielle is instantly smitten with him.

Gabrielle shows Alan her paintings—the first time she has shown them to anyone—and reads him a favorite François Villon poem. Boze Hertzlinger, a beefy diner employee who has wooed Gabrielle in vain, grows jealous of Alan, who decides to leave forthwith. He mooches a ride from wealthy tourists Mr. and Mrs. Chisholm; but after only a few minutes on the road they encounter Duke Mantee, a notorious gangster fleeing a massive police pursuit, whose car has broken down. Duke and his gang seize the Chisholms&#x27; car and drive to the diner, where Duke has arranged to rendezvous with his girlfriend, Doris, on their way to Mexico. Alan, the Chisholms, and their chauffeur soon make their way back to the diner as well.

Alan, indifferent to the hostage situation, engages Duke in lively conversation and toasts him as &quot;the last great apostle of rugged individualism.&quot; Boze snatches a rifle and gets the drop on Duke, but during a momentary distraction Duke draws his pistol and shoots Boze in the hand, regaining control. Duke learns that Doris has been captured, and has revealed their rendezvous location to the police. As police and federal agents converge on the diner, Duke prepares to flee, announcing that he will take Mr. and Mrs. Chisholm with him.

Inspired by Boze&#x27;s act of courage, Alan responds to an impulse: While Gabrielle is in the back room bandaging Boze&#x27;s hand, he produces a life insurance policy from his bag and amends it, making Gabrielle the beneficiary. Then he asks Duke to kill him (&quot;It couldn&#x27;t make any difference to you, Duke ... they can hang you only once ...&quot;), so that Gabrielle can use the insurance money to realize her dream of moving to France. Duke obliges, after Alan blocks him from leaving with his human shields; then Duke leaves, only to be caught by the police. Alan dies in Gabrielle&#x27;s arms, secure in the knowledge that she, unlike the rest, will escape her dead-end existence to pursue her dreams.

==History==

The 1935 Broadway production of &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; starred Howard, an established star, and Bogart, an actor in his first leading theatrical role. Sherwood based the Duke Mantee character on John Dillinger, the notorious criminal who in 1933 was named the FBI&#x27;s first &quot;Public Enemy #1&quot; by J. Edgar Hoover, and in 1934 was ambushed and gunned down in spectacular fashion by FBI agents. Bogart, who won the stage role in part because of his physical resemblance to Dillinger, studied film footage of the gangster and mimicked some of his mannerisms in his portrayal.

For the film, Warner Brothers intended to cast the more bankable Edward G. Robinson as Duke; but Howard, whose contract gave him final script control, informed the studio that he would not appear in the movie version without Bogart as his co-star. The film made Bogart a star, and he remained grateful to Howard for the rest of his life. In 1952, Bogart and Lauren Bacall named their daughter Leslie Howard Bogart in honor of Howard, who had been killed in a plane crash when the German air force shot down his BOAC flight from Lisbon to Bristol during World War II.

In 1948, Robinson portrayed a character similar to Duke Mantee—a gangster holding a disparate group of people hostage in a Florida hotel—in &quot;Key Largo&quot;. That film&#x27;s hero was played by Bogart. In his penultimate film, &quot;The Desperate Hours&quot; (1955), Bogart played another gangster holding a suburban family hostage. He described that character as &quot;Duke Mantee grown up.&quot;

==Radio and television adaptations==

&quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; was performed in a one-hour radio adaptation on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on November 22, 1937, with Herbert Marshall, Margaret Sullavan, and Donald Meek in the principal roles; and again on &quot;Lux Radio&quot; on April 23, 1945, with Ronald Colman, Susan Hayward, and Lawrence Tierney.

A half-hour radio adaptation starring Joan Bennett, Tyrone Power, and Bogart also aired on &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot; on January 7, 1940.

On September 20, 1953, the radio series &quot;Best Plays&quot; aired a one-hour adaptation, starring Cyril Ritchard and Joan Lorring.

In 1955, a live television version was performed in color as an installment of &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;, a weekly dramatic anthology, featuring Bogart (now top-billed) as Mantee, Henry Fonda as Alan, and Lauren Bacall as Gabrielle. Jack Klugman, Richard Jaeckel, and Jack Warden played supporting roles. The television version differs from the film in that it opens with Bogart and his men shown briefly in a getaway car driving through the desert and conversing for a moment. In the late 1990s, Bacall donated the only known kinescope of the 1955 performance (albeit in black and white) to the Museum of Television &amp; Radio (now the Paley Center for Media), where it remains archived for viewing in New York City and Los Angeles. It is now in the public domain.

==Reception and legacy==
Rotten Tomatoes rates the film 100% fresh based on 14 contemporary and modern reviews.

The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in the 2003 AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains in which Duke Mantee appears as a Nominated Villain.

In January 1936, Variety wrote: “The picture sticks closely to the legit script... Playing the roles they created in the stage version are Leslie Howard and Humphrey Bogart – the former a soul-broken, disillusioned author, seeking, by wayfaring, to find some new significance in living, and the latter a killer, harried and surrounded by pursuers, revealing in his last moments a bewildered desperation which is not far removed from that of the writer. The scenes in which the desperado holds court, as he awaits his own doom, …are packed with skillfully etched drama and embroidered with appropriate touches of comedy. Impressively enacted is the romance between Howard and Bette Davis... Davis gives a characterization that fetches both sympathy and admiration. Bogart’s menace leaves nothing wanting.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mildly poor review. Exploring the transition between Mayo&#x27;s film and the original stage play from Sherwood, Greene found that Sherwood&#x27;s lofty philosophy suffered from the adaptation and that the film&#x27;s &quot;drama slackens under the weight&quot; of the playwright&#x27;s themes which he characterized as &quot;rather half-baked&quot;. Greene praises Davis and Howard for their performances but suggests that &quot;life itself, which crept in during the opening scene [...] crept out again, leaving us only with the symbols.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine at the time of the film&#x27;s release, Ann Ross observed: “Very young people won&#x27;t find The Petrified Forest much fun, but adults, who like wise and witty talk, with or without gunplay, should find it rewarding.”

Writing for &quot;Sur&quot; in September 1936, Jorge Luis Borges said the film was “one of the most intense that I have seen.” He praised the “extraordinarily distinct characters”, observing that “once the allegorical motive is dismissed or relegated to a secondary level. the plot of &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;—-the magical influence of approaching death on a random group of men and women—-seems admirable to me. In this film, death works like hypnosis or alcohol: it brings the recesses of the soul into the light of day.”

After the film&#x27;s release, Friz Freleng made the short-length Merrie Melodies cartoon parody, &quot;She Was an Acrobat&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1937), which portrays a cinema audience watching &quot;The Petrified Florist&quot;, starring Bette Savis and Lester Coward.

In 1972, a take-off of the film titled &quot;The Putrified Forest&quot; was a sketch on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, featuring Steve Lawrence and Paul Sand.

The Warner Brothers sound stage on which the movie was filmed later became the home of Conan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s TBS television program.

The 2017 album &quot;The Petrified Forest&quot; by ambient musician Biosphere uses many clips of dialog from the film.

<doc id="560431" wikidata="Q1693743" url="?curid=560431" title="Stranger on the Third Floor">
<text>Stranger on the Third Floor is a 1940 American film noir directed by Boris Ingster and starring Peter Lorre, John McGuire, Margaret Tallichet, and Charles Waldron, and featuring Elisha Cook Jr. It was written by Frank Partos. Modern research has shown that Nathanael West wrote the final version of the screenplay, but was uncredited.

&quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot; is often cited as the first &quot;true&quot; film noir of the classic period (1940–1959), though other films that fit the genre such as &quot;Rebecca&quot; and &quot;They Drive by Night&quot; were released earlier. Nonetheless, it has many of the hallmarks of film noir: an urban setting, heavy shadows, diagonal lines, voice-over narration, a dream sequence, low camera angles shooting up multi-story staircases, and an innocent protagonist desperate to clear himself after being falsely accused of a crime.

==Plot==
Reporter Michael Ward is the key witness in a murder trial. His evidence – that he saw the accused, Joe Briggs, standing over the body of a man in a diner – is instrumental in having Briggs found guilty.

Afterwards, Ward&#x27;s fiancée Jane begins worrying that Ward may not have been correct in what he saw; eventually Ward becomes haunted by this question.

One evening, outside his room in the house where he lives, Ward sees an odd-looking stranger. He chases this man down the stairs and out the front door where Ward loses track of him. Ward feels that his neighbor, a man he hates, may have been killed by the stranger. Ward has a terrifying dream in which the neighbor is indeed murdered and he comes under suspicion.

It turns out the neighbor was killed the same way as the man in the diner. Ward finds the body, notifies police and points out the similarities in the two murders. He is arrested and, in order to clear him, Jane sets out to find the strange man.

Margaret Tallichet, who played Jane, married film director William Wyler on October 23, 1938, at the home of actor Walter Huston and continued to make films, including &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot; in 1940. She made two more films, then retired from acting.

== Production == 
&quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot; was Boris Ingster&#x27;s directorial debut. Ingster, who was born in Latvia, was formerly a writer, and an associate of noted Russian director Sergei Eisenstein. Ingster would later become a television producer. He directed only three feature films in his career.

In the introduction to Turner Classic Movies&#x27; &quot;Noir Alley&quot; presentation of the film, Eddie Muller compared the style of the film to that of German Expressionist films. Jeremy Arnold writes that the film&#x27;s &quot;extraordinary look and tone are the product of stylized sets, bizarre angles and lighting, and a powerful blurring of dream and reality – qualities strongly influenced by German expressionist films of the 1920s.&quot; Robert Portfino called it &quot;a distinct break in style and substance with the preceding mystery, crime, detection and horror films of the 1930s.&quot; In their book &quot;Kings of the Bs&quot;, Todd McCarthy and Charles Flynn wrote that &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot; &quot;is extremely audacious in terms of what it seeks to say about American society...The trial of the ex-con is a vicious rendering of the American legal system hard at work on an impoverished victim...[T]he sinister role of police and prosecutors in obtaining confessions and convictions [are] hallmarks of the hard-boiled literature that paralleled and predicted what we call film noir.&quot;

Van Nest Polglase, who has been called &quot;one of the most influential production designers in American cinema&quot;, was the film&#x27;s art director. He had previously worked on &quot;King Kong&quot; in 1933 and &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; in 1939, and worked on the sets for &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. His work on &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot; &quot;contributes mightily to the claustrophobic feel of the movie.&quot; Muller calls his work on this film &quot;spectacular&quot;. In addition, the work of special effects artist Vernon L. Walker was excellent despite the constraints of a B movie budget, and the score of Roy Webb, who was RKO&#x27;s house composer at the time, contributes significantly to the film&#x27;s mood.

==Reception==
Upon its release in 1940, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film pretentious and derivative of French and Russian films, and wrote &quot;John McGuire and Margaret Tallichet, as the reporter and his girl, are permitted to act half-way normal, it is true. But in every other respect, including Peter Lorre&#x27;s brief role as the whack, it is utterly wild. The notion seems to have been that the way to put a psychological melodrama across is to pile on the sound effects and trick up the photography.&quot;

The staff writer at &quot;Variety&quot; also believed the film was derivative, and wrote &quot;The familiar artifice of placing the scribe in parallel plight, with the newspaperman arrested for two slayings and only clearing himself because of his sweetheart&#x27;s persistent search for the real slayer, is used...Boris Ingster&#x27;s direction is too studied and when original, lacks the flare to hold attention. It&#x27;s a film too arty for average audiences, and too humdrum for others.&quot;

Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote: &quot;An RKO B-film from 1940, done up in high Hollywood expressionism. It&#x27;s absurdly overwrought (which was often the problem with the German variety), but interesting for it. The director, Boris Ingster, is better with shadows than with actors – venetian blinds carve up the characters with more fateful force than Paul Schrader&#x27;s similar gambit in &quot;American Gigolo&quot;, and there&#x27;s a dream sequence that has to be seen to be disbelieved.&quot;

Another film reviewer, P.S. Harrison, wrote that &quot;at [the film&#x27;s] conclusion, one feels as if one had gone through a nightmare.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86%, with an average rating of 6.6/10, based on seven professional reviews.

<text>High Sierra is a 1941 American film noir directed by Raoul Walsh, written by William R. Burnett and John Huston from the novel by Burnett, and starring Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart. Its plot follows a career criminal who becomes involved in a jewel heist in a resort town in California&#x27;s Sierra Nevada, along with a young former taxi dancer (Lupino).

Parts of the film were shot on location at Whitney Portal, halfway up Mount Whitney.

The screenplay was co-written by John Huston, Bogart&#x27;s friend and drinking partner, adapted from the novel by William R. Burnett (also known for, among others, the novel &quot;Little Caesar&quot; and the script for &quot;Scarface&quot;). The film cemented a strong personal and professional connection between Bogart and Huston, and provided the breakthrough in Bogart&#x27;s career, transforming him from supporting player to leading man. The film&#x27;s success also led to a breakthrough for Huston, providing him with the leverage he needed to make the transition from screenwriter to director, which he made later that year with his adaptation of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), starring Bogart.

The film contains extensive location shooting, especially in the climactic final scenes, as the authorities pursue Bogart&#x27;s character, gangster Roy Earle, from Lone Pine to the foot of the mountains. The novel is also the basis of the western &quot;Colorado Territory&quot; (also directed by Walsh, starring Joel McCrea &amp; Virginia Mayo) and the scene-by-scene remake &quot; I Died a Thousand Times &quot;(directed by Stuart Heisler with Jack Palance as Roy Earle and Shelley Winters as Marie).

==Plot==
An aging gangster, Big Mac, is planning a robbery at a fashionable resort hotel in the resort town of Tropico Springs in the Sierra Nevada. He wants the heist led by convicted bank robber Roy Earle, whose recent release from an Indiana prison was engineered by Big Mac&#x27;s bribing the governor. Roy drives cross-country to an abandoned logging camp in the mountains to meet with the three men who will assist him in the heist: Louis Mendoza works as a clerk in the hotel, while Red and Babe are living at the camp. Babe has brought along his girlfriend Marie Garson, a dance hall performer from Los Angeles.

Deriding Marie&#x27;s involvement, Roy at first insists she return to Los Angeles, but after some discussion he agrees to let her stay. At the camp, Algernon, a handyman, introduces Roy to Pard, a small dog to whom he takes a liking, and Roy decides to adopt the dog. Meanwhile, Marie falls in love with Roy, but he does not share her feelings. In Tropico Springs, Roy witnesses a minor car accident involving Ma and Pa Goodhue and their granddaughter Velma, a young woman with a clubfoot who walks with a limp. Swiftly enamored with Velma, Roy pays for corrective surgery to allow her to walk normally, despite her grandfather&#x27;s warning that Velma is engaged. While she is recovering, Roy asks Velma to marry him, but she refuses, explaining that she is devoted to her fiancé back East.

The group execute the heist at the hotel, but it goes awry when they are interrupted by a security guard. Roy makes his getaway with Marie and a stash of jewelry from the hotel safe, but Mendoza, Red, and Babe are involved in a car accident in which Red and Babe die. Mendoza is captured by the police who question him. Roy and Marie drive to Los Angeles with the jewels, only to find that Big Mac has died of a heart attack and that Jake Kranmer, an ex-policeman, has taken over the operation. Kranmer tries to force Roy to give him the jewels, but a defiant Roy shoots him dead.

Back in Los Angeles, Roy visits Velma, having promised her he would come to see her when she is able to walk. He then meets with a fence who is to pay for the stolen jewels, but the man tells Roy he cannot pay him the $30,000 immediately. While the fence holds onto the jewels, Roy gives Marie an engagement ring. He and Marie go into hiding at a hotel, but they panic when Roy&#x27;s name and face make newspaper headlines, and the stories mention both Marie and even the dog&#x27;s name &quot;Pard&quot;, based on what Mendoza has told the police.

Deciding that he would be safer on his own, Roy sends Marie and Pard to Las Vegas by bus. He returns to Los Angeles to get paid for the jewelry. Figuring on collecting immediately, he has given all his ready cash to Marie. When his car runs low on gas, Roy risks a small town stickup and is immediately recognized. Roy is pursued by police back into the mountains, where he is forced to abandon his car and flee on foot. Marie hears a news broadcast about the chase. She is then interrogated by investigators, who try to persuade her to lure Roy out of hiding. She refuses, knowing that Roy would rather die than return to prison. The police force her to accompany them on their search in the mountains. Meanwhile, Roy hides out behind a large rock on the mountainside.

At dawn, Pard escapes the police encampment and locates Roy, who is suddenly distracted by the dog&#x27;s barking. Assuming Marie has found him, Roy runs out onto a precipice, calling her name, and is killed by a sharpshooter. Marie watches in horror from below as Roy&#x27;s body topples down the mountainside. Followed by officers, Marie rushes to Roy&#x27;s body, as does Pard, who lies down next to him. As Marie is escorted away with Pard, she takes small comfort in knowing that Roy will not be returning to prison.

==Themes==
Luke Goodsell, writing for &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot;, writes that &quot;High Sierra&quot; presents its heist narrative as &quot;something of a grasp for the fabled new America. Here, the Old West has been replaced by health spas and diets and a clean-living California; not coincidentally, a land that flourished in tandem with the aspirational illusion of Hollywood.&quot;

==Production==
George Raft was intended to play Roy Earle, but Bogart, who took a great interest in playing the role, managed to talk Raft out of accepting it. Walsh tried to persuade Raft otherwise but Raft did not want his character to die at the end of the film. &quot;Filmink&quot; said Raft &quot;turned down &quot;High Sierra&quot; because it was another gangster part, despite the excellent source material and Raoul Walsh directing (admittedly Paul Muni rejected the role first for the same reason… but Muni was a proper actor, well established in a variety of parts and Raft wasn’t).&quot;

Bogart had to persuade director Walsh to hire him for the role, because Walsh envisioned Bogart as a supporting player rather than a leading man, although writer John Huston saw potential in Bogart that others in the studio did not perceive. Ida Lupino had received good publicity in connection with her performance in &quot;They Drive by Night&quot;, and this caused producer Mark Hellinger to suggest to executive producer Hal Wallis that Lupino be billed over Bogart, who to that point had only starred in &quot;B&quot; movies; in later releases of the film, Bogart got top billing. Bogart&#x27;s portrayal of Roy Earle in &quot;High Sierra&quot; made him a star, and changed the way Warner Bros. saw him.

Pard, the dog of Bogart&#x27;s character, was erroneously believed by some to be canine actor Terry (Toto from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;). It was in fact Bogart&#x27;s own dog, Zero. In the final scene, Buster Wiles, a stunt performer, plays Roy&#x27;s corpse. His hand is filled with biscuits to encourage Pard to lick Roy&#x27;s hand.

Many key shots of the movie were filmed on location in the Sierra Nevada, including Big Bear Lake and Lake Arrowhead in California. In a climactic scene, Bogart&#x27;s character slid down a mountainside to his just reward. His stunt double, Wiles, bounced a few times going down the mountain and wanted another take to do better. &quot;Forget it,&quot; said Raoul Walsh. &quot;It&#x27;s good enough for the 25-cent customers.&quot; Special effects were by Byron Haskin and H. F. Koenekamp.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;High Sierra&quot; opened theatrically in Los Angeles on January 23, 1941. According to Warner Bros. records, the film made $1,063,000 in the U.S. ($ million in terms) and $426,000 ($ million in terms) in other markets.

===Critical response===
Critic Bosley Crowther liked the acting in the picture, and wrote &quot;As gangster pictures go, this one has everything—speed, excitement, suspense, and that ennobling suggestion of futility, which makes for irony and pity. Mr. Bogart plays the leading role with a perfection of hard-boiled vitality, and Ida Lupino, Arthur Kennedy, Alan Curtis, and a newcomer named Joan Leslie handle lesser roles effectively. Especially, is Miss Lupino impressive as the adoring moll. As gangster pictures go—if they do—it&#x27;s a perfect epilogue. Count on the old guard and Warners: they die but never surrender.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; reviewed the film when released as having &quot;less of realistic savagery than of the quaint, nostalgic atmosphere of costume drama.&quot; The reviewer noted, &quot;What makes &quot;High Sierra&quot; something more than a Grade B melodrama is its sensitive delineation of gangster Earle&#x27;s character. Superbly played by Actor Bogart, Earle is a complex human being, a farmer boy who turned mobster, a gunman with a string of murders on his record who still is shocked when newsmen call him &quot;Mad-Dog&quot; Earle. He is kind to the mongrel dog (Zero) that travels with him, befriends a taxi dancer (Ida Lupino) who becomes his moll, and goes out of his way to help a crippled girl (Joan Leslie). All Roy Earle wants is freedom. He finds it for good on a lonely peak in the mountains.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a critic score of 91%, based on 22 reviews.

===Home media===
Warner Home Video released &quot;High Sierra&quot; on DVD in November 2003. On October 12, 2021, The Criterion Collection released a new edition of the film on Blu-ray and DVD.

==Adaptations==
* A radio play on two broadcasts of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, first on January 4, 1942, with Humphrey Bogart and Claire Trevor, and the second on April 17, 1944, with Bogart and Ida Lupino
* The Western &quot;Colorado Territory&quot; (1949), starring Joel McCrea and Virginia Mayo, and also directed by Raoul Walsh, was also based on W. R. Burnett&#x27;s novel. 
* &quot;I Died a Thousand Times&quot; (1955), starring Jack Palance and Shelley Winters, directed by Stuart Heisler was based on Burnett&#x27;s novel as well.

<doc id="560450" wikidata="Q5368348" url="?curid=560450" title="Elwood Richard Quesada">
<text>Elwood Richard Quesada, CB, CBE (April 13, 1904 – February 9, 1993), nicknamed &quot;Pete&quot;, was a United States Air Force Lt. General, FAA administrator, and, later, a club owner in Major League Baseball.

==Early years==
Elwood Richard Quesada was born in Washington, D.C., in 1904 to an Irish-American mother and a Spanish father. He attended Wyoming Seminary in Kingston, Pa., University of Maryland, College Park, and Georgetown University.

==Early military career==
In September 1924, Quesada enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps as a flying cadet and was commissioned as a reserve officer a year later. He had a wide variety of assignments as aide to senior officers, military attaché and technical adviser to other air forces, and in intelligence. He was also part of the team (with Ira Eaker and Carl Spaatz) that developed and demonstrated air-to-air refueling in 1929 on the &quot;Question Mark&quot;. All five crew members were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for their participation in the mission.

==Tactical airpower pioneer==

As a junior officer, Quesada became interested in the concept of close air support of ground forces, which was thoroughly developed by the 9th AF during his time as commander in North Africa and Europe.

Quesada was instrumental in developing many of the principles of tactical air-ground warfare for the Ninth Air Force during the European campaign. Innovations attributed to him included adapting a microwave early warning radar (MEW) for real-time direction of fighter bombers that were already in-flight, as well as placing pilots as forward air controllers inside tanks equipped with VHF aircraft radios on the front lines. This latter technique allowed for direct ground communication with overhead fighter-bombers by personnel who understood what pilots needed to identify ground targets. Besides reducing friendly fire incidents, such tactics allowed attacking ground troops to use close air support with greater precision and speed, allowing for air cover to take the place of artillery support in a rapid armored advance. These improved tactics enormously expanded the contributions of tactical airpower to the Allied defeat of Germany on the Western Front.

==Postwar difficulties==
In 1946, Quesada was appointed as the first commander of the Tactical Air Command (TAC) and later promoted to lieutenant general in the newly independent U.S. Air Force. However, Quesada quickly became disillusioned as he saw how TAC was being ignored while funding and promotions were largely going to the Strategic Air Command.

In December 1948, Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg stripped TAC of its planes and pilots and reduced its status to that of a planning headquarters under the newly formed Continental Air Command. Strategic airpower advocates such as General Curtis LeMay gained a lock on the budget for the Air Force in the post-World War II years, and the Air Force&#x27;s tactical air warfare ability suffered.

Quesada thus asked for reassignment and was given a dead-end job by Vandenberg as head of a committee to find ways to combine the Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard. Quesada was removed from this job after only two months, as his blunt and impatient nature only served to stir up controversy in this near-impossible task. A subsequent heated exchange during a meeting with Vandenberg and LeMay regarding the slow progress of the committee only added to Quesada&#x27;s difficulties. These episodes led to his request for early retirement from the Air Force, at the age of 47 in 1951.

The onset of the Korean War resulted in the re-formation of TAC, headed by Quesada&#x27;s friend, General Otto P. Weyland, who led the XIX TAC during World War II. To Quesada&#x27;s dismay, Vandenberg and LeMay credited Weyland for “restoring both the morale and professionalism of TAC”. Weyland gratefully accepted this praise, further infuriating Quesada.

==Civilian and family life==

On October 12, 1946, Quesada married Kate Davis Putnam, a war widow (her first husband was Capt. Henry Ware Putnam, who died in an air raid over Tokyo on May 25, 1945). She was a granddaughter of newspaper mogul Joseph Pulitzer, and inherited part of his holdings. Mrs. Quesada had two daughters from her previous marriage; the Quesadas had two sons of their own: Thomas Ricardo Quesada and Peter Wickham Quesada.

He served as an executive for Lockheed Aircraft Corporation from 1953–55. In 1957, he became President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s Special Adviser for Aviation, leading to his appointment as the first administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (At that time a cabinet level agency known as the Federal Aviation Agency-FAA) from 1959–61.

As FAA chairman, Quesada was instrumental, along with American Airlines president C. R. Smith, in passing a mandatory retirement age of 60 for commercial airline pilots. Smith had lobbied for this rule on the grounds that young pilots with experience serving in World War II and the Korean War would be cheap and easy to train for the new jetliners. Quesada agreed, but went even further to suggest that civilian pilots be barred entirely from jetliner cockpits. The age 60 rule went into effect in 1960 and remained in effect until 2007, although Quesada&#x27;s proposal to limit jetliners to ex-military personnel was ignored along with an additional suggestion of his that jetliner training be limited to pilots under 55.

C.R. Smith rewarded Quesada handsomely for his help; after the latter stepped down as FAA chairman in 1961, he was granted a seat on American Airlines&#x27; board of directors.

Quesada became involved in professional sports when he became owner of the expansion Washington Senators in 1961. Quesada sold his stake in the team two years later. He later became President and Chief Executive Officer of the L&#x27;Enfant Plaza Corporation, a private corporation that successfully partnered with the Federal government to develop L&#x27;Enfant Plaza. He later became a member of the Temporary Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue, a precursor of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, which helped redevelop Pennsylvania Avenue NW between the White House and the United States Capitol.

Quesada, his wife, and their two sons were involved in a dispute with Joseph Pulitzer III in 1986 over the control and value of the sons&#x27; shares in the St. Louis &quot;Post-Dispatch&quot;.

==Death==
General Quesada died on February 9, 1993, at a Jupiter, Florida, hospital and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.
His wife Kate Davis Putnam Quesada died March 5, 2003, and was interred with him at Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="560477" wikidata="Q5985805" url="?curid=560477" title="Icelandic hip-hop">
<text>Icelandic hip hop is hip hop culture from Iceland, which includes hip hop music and rapping, breakdancing by b-girls and b-boys, and graffiti artists and graffiti writers. Early hip hop groups included Quarashi, Subterranean, Team 13 (which later became Twisted Minds), Multifunctionals, Oblivion, Bounce Brothers and Hip Hop Elements (later named Kritikal Mazz). The next generation of hip hop performers, notably BlazRoca and Sesar A, rapped in Icelandic. XXX Rottweiler and Sesar A published the first all Icelandic hip hop albums in 2001. Subsequent artists included Bæjarins bestu, Móri, Afkvæmi Guðanna (The Offspring of the Gods), Bent og 7Berg (Bent and 7Berg), Skytturnar (The Marksmen), Hæsta Hendin (The Highest Hand) and Forgotten Lores. MGísli Palmi, Þriðja Hæðin (The Third Floor), Cell 7, Kilo, Shadez of Reykjavík, Úlfur Úlfur, and Emmsjé Gauti. Icelandic lyrics are usually very direct and aggressive, with battle raps. An important hip hop events is Rímnaflæði in Miðberg, a freestyle competition. Element Crew has been the leading B-boy crew since 1998. The graffiti scene started 1991 with graffiti writers such as ONE, Pharokees, Atom, Sharq, Kez and Youze.

==History==
The first mainstream hip hop crew from Iceland was Quarashi, who were inspired by the rock hybrid music of Beastie Boys and Rage Against the Machine. Around the same time Quarashi released their first album, several rap groups were formed such as Subterranean which are considered to have released one of Icelandic hiphop&#x27;s biggest classics, Central Magnetizm. Other groups included Team 13 (which later became Twisted Minds), Multifunctionals, Oblivion, Bounce Brothers and Hip Hop Elements (later named Kritikal Mazz). They all rapped in English except for one song from Multifunctionals called &quot;Númer 1.&quot; During that time the first crew rapping entirely in Icelandic came forward with aggressive radio singles: that band was Sækópah and consisted of the rappers BlazRoca and Sesar A. Shortly thereafter, they formed SupahSyndikal along with members of Subterranean and Tríó Óla Skans. BlazRoca and Sesar A were vital to the second generation of artists that defined itself by rapping in Icelandic. 

XXX Rottweiler (formerly known as 110 Rottweilerhundar), along with Sesar A, published the first all Icelandic hip hop albums in Iceland in 2001. In 2002 a new wave of rappers had followed their lead by rapping exclusively in Icelandic: Bæjarins bestu, the freestyle battle champs of Iceland in one unit, Móri, a gangsta rapper who uses Icelandic, Afkvæmi Guðanna (The Offspring of the Gods), Bent og 7Berg (Bent and 7Berg), Skytturnar (The Marksmen), Hæsta Hendin (The Highest Hand) and Forgotten Lores. Most of these groups have stopped making music, and other artists and bands have started to make a name for themselves in the Icelandic hip hop culture. The most active artists today include Gísli Palmi, Þriðja Hæðin (The Third Floor), Cell 7, Kilo, Shadez of Reykjavík, Úlfur Úlfur, Aron Can, GKR, Alexander Jarl, Agust Bent and Emmsjé Gauti. Icelandic lyrics are usually very direct and aggressive, with battle raps forming a sizable portion of Icelandic hip hop.

One of the largest hip hop events is Rímnaflæði in Miðberg, a freestyle competition where young MCs and rap bands (usually ages sixteen and younger) compete by rapping a single song on stage. The first jury was made up of Sesar A, BlazRoca (XXX Rottweiler hundar) and Omar Swarez (Quarashi).

==Subgenres==
Icelandic hip hop culture also includes active scenes with their own subculture.

===Breakdance===
Element Crew is the leading b-boy crew (since 1998) under the leadership of Gretski. Breakdancing was first seen on Iceland around 1983. It grew popular in a short amount of time, but by the beginning of the 1990s it had all but faded out. Around 1997, breakdancing began to grow more popular, with Shakers Crew.

===Graffiti===
The Graffiti scene first took off in Iceland around 1991 with writers such as ONE, Pharokees, Atom, Sharq, Kez and Youze. Crews such as SR (Stash Riders) and LCF (Le Circle Ferme) were the first big influentials. Then around 1997 TMC (Twisted Minds Crew) broke out with members Senze and Natur being the most active. In the same year CAN Crew (Can Armed Ninjas) was formed by Sketz and Sare One. Sare One is known today as Nores and is now a member of the TMC. With his arrival on the scene the style took a big step forward and he is the most potent individual for Icelandic Graffiti. Foreign artists who have temporarily lived in Iceland have also made an impact, notably Kegr and Jiroe.

<text>The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 (), or Convention between the United Kingdom and Russia relating to Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet (; ), was signed on August 31, 1907, in Saint Petersburg. It ended the two powers&#x27; longstanding rivalry in Central Asia and enabled them to outflank the Germans, who were threatening to connect Berlin to Baghdad with a new railroad that could potentially align the Ottoman Empire with Imperial Germany.

The Convention ended the long dispute over Persia between the two parties. Great Britain promised to stay out of northern Persia, and Russia recognized southern Persia as part of the British sphere of influence. Russia also promised to stay out of Tibet and Afghanistan. In exchange, London extended loans and some political support. The convention brought shaky British–Russian relations to the forefront by solidifying boundaries that identified respective control in Persia, Afghanistan, and Tibet. This agreement would eventually form a component of the Triple Entente.

== Background ==

During the last third of the nineteenth century, the Russian Empire&#x27;s advances into Central Asia and the consolidation of Great Britain&#x27;s domination of South Asia led to intense rivalry between the two European powers. The conflicting interests centered on Afghanistan, Iran, and Tibet, three states that constituted buffers between the two powers. The emergence of the German Empire as a world power and the defeat in 1905 of Russia by a nascent Asian power, the Empire of Japan, in the Russo-Japanese War, helped to persuade some British and Russian officials of a need to resolve their respective differences in Asia. There was talk of an entente during the 1880s and 1890s, especially after Britain&#x27;s occupation of Egypt in 1882. However, there was stiff resistance in Britain to a deal with Russia. In the leadup to the convention, there were discussions on the Straits question. Foreign Minister Sir Edward Grey thought entente with Russia a good idea. On 20 October 1905, during the election, he said:
...if Russia accepts, cordially and whole-heartedly, our intention to preserve the peaceable possession of our Asiatic possessions, then I am quite sure that in this country no government will make it its business to thwart or obstruct Russia&#x27;s policy in Europe. On the contrary, it is urgently desirable that Russia&#x27;s position and influence be re-established in the councils of Europe.
and later, writing to his ambassador to Russia Sir Arthur Nicolson:
It is not for us to propose changes with regard to the treaty conditions of the Dardanelles. I think some change in the direction desired by Russia would be admissible and we should be prepared to discuss the question if Russia introduces it.
In early 1907, Alexander Izvolsky, the Russian ambassador at Paris, raised the question and talks were carried on in London with Russian Ambassador Count Alexander Benckendorff. Little is known but the &quot;suggestion appears to have been made that Russia should have free egress from the Black Sea through the Straits, while other powers should have the right to send their vessels of war into the Straits without going into the Black Sea&quot; together with some talk of &quot;Russia&#x27;s occupying the Bosphorus and England the Dardanelles, after which the Straits might be opened to other warships as well.&quot; In the event nothing came of the discussions at the time.

=== Rise of Germany ===
On May 20, 1882, Germany entered into the Triple Alliance with Italy and Austria-Hungary, complementing its industrial and socio-political ascendance in the world arena. Furthermore, Germany dramatically increased its military output from the early 1900s up to the outbreak of the First World War. Under the unified German state, Otto von Bismarck worked to increase the nation&#x27;s global influence and reach what was then the zenith of German power. While Britain and Russia were hostile to German designs in the region, members of the Triple Alliance were in turn opposed to Anglo-Russian influence in Asia. Thus, military and territorial expansion was Germany&#x27;s key to making itself a major player in the international arena of power. Germany&#x27;s interest in the Middle East took a secondary position, one subordinate to Germany&#x27;s primary policy toward Europe, throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While of secondary importance, it was a tool that was used to manipulate the Middle Eastern attempt to play off the Western powers against each other. Berlin peacefully made inroads into the Ottoman Empire and had few colonial aspirations in the region.

=== Trouble in Persia ===
In 1905, revolutionary activity spread throughout Tehran, forcing the shah to accept a constitution, allow the formation of a &quot;majles&quot; (parliamentary assembly), and hold elections. Major figures in the revolution had secular goals, which then created rifts in the clergy to the advantage of the monarchy. Neither the British nor the Russian governments approved of the new political arrangement, which was both liberal and unstable, and preferred a stable puppet government, which allowed foreign concessions and supported their designs in the region.

To facilitate their goals in Persia, the British and the Russian governments discussed splitting it into three zones. The agreement stipulated that it would &quot;allocate the north, including Isfahan, to Russia; the south-east, especially Kerman, Sistan, and Baluchistan to Britain; and demarcate the remaining land between the two powers as a neutral zone&quot;. The division of Persia would reinforce the control of Britain and Russia over their respective territorial and economic interests in the country as well as allowed for continued interference in Persia&#x27;s political system. With foreign help, the revolutionaries became outflanked by a combination of European and monarchist activities. The Persian government quickly came to realise that an Anglo-Russian alliance posed a larger threat to Iranian sovereignty than the two powers being hostile. Consequently, in 1907, Britain and Russia signed an agreement to regulate their economic and political interests.

==Terms==
The Anglo-Russian Convention formalized the spheres of influence of the Russian Empire and the British Empire in Persia, Afghanistan and Tibet.

===Persia===

The agreement recognized the country&#x27;s sovereignty but also divided it into three separate zones. The agreement designated all of northern Iran, which bordered Russia&#x27;s possessions in Transcaucasia and Central Asia, as an exclusive sphere of influence for Russian interests. The northern zone was defined as beginning at Qasr-e Shirin in the west, on the border with the Ottoman Empire, and running through Tehran, Isfahan and Yazd to the eastern border, where the frontiers of Afghanistan, Iran, and Russia intersected. A smaller zone in southeastern Iran, which bordered British India, was recognized as an exclusive sphere for Britain. The British zone extended west as far as Kerman in the south central and Bandar Abbas in the south. The area separating these two spheres, including part of central Iran and the entire southwest, was designated a neutral zone in which both countries and their respective private citizens could compete for influence and commercial privileges.

For Britain and Russia, the agreement was important in establishing a diplomatic alignment that endured until the First World War. The Persian government, however, had not been consulted about the agreement but was informed after it had been signed. Although not in a position to prevent Britain and Russia from implementing the agreement, the Persian government refused to recognize the accord&#x27;s legitimacy since it threatened the country&#x27;s national integrity. Iranian nationalists, in particular, were infuriated by Britain&#x27;s signing of the treaty, a country that they had considered as a beacon of democracy during the Constitutional Revolution. Subsequently, an important legacy of the agreement was the growth of anti-British sentiments and other anti-Western attitudes as strong components of Iranian nationalism. The agreement did not eliminate all competition between the two powers with respect to their policies in Iran, but after 1907, broad co-operation was fostered, particularly when Anglo-Russian interests were threatened. In particular, Britain and Russia intervened in Iran&#x27;s domestic politics, supporting the royalists in their struggle with the constitutionalists. The agreement lapsed in 1918, after it was renounced by the new revolutionary Soviet Russia.

===Afghanistan===

With the Anglo-Russian Convention Russia acknowledged that Afghanistan was in the British sphere of influence as long as the United Kingdom did not attack the country, and in exchange, the United Kingdom gave Russia&#x27;s right to equal commerce and direct communication with Afghan officials on non-political topics. Habibullah Khan, the Emir of Afghanistan felt humiliated and outraged when he read the terms of the Convention, partly because the United Kingdom had not bothered to notify him about the negotiations or their conclusions. Like the terms relating to Persia, the agreement resulted in the growth of anti-British sentiments in Afghanistan.

===Tibet===

The Anglo-Russian Convention acknowledged the &quot;Chinese suzerainty&quot; over Tibet, and the United Kingdom pledged not to deal with Tibet unilaterally without the approval of the Chinese government. The United Kingdom thought that this convention would put a stop to Russia&#x27;s expansionist efforts, which were threatening India, and with the development of Anglo-Russian ties in the early 1900s, both the United Kingdom and Russia acknowledged Tibet&#x27;s role as a buffer in the Anglo-Russian Convention that also recognized the suzerainty of China over Tibet, although China did not accept the term &quot;suzerainty&quot; and instead used the term &quot;sovereignty&quot; to describe its status in Tibet since 1905. The conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Convention followed the British expedition to Tibet of 1903-1904, the Convention of Lhasa of 1904, and the Anglo-Chinese Convention of 1906 which essentially reestablished China&#x27;s role as Tibet&#x27;s controlling power.

<text>The Franco-Russian Alliance (, ), also known as the Dual Entente or Russo-French Rapprochement (&quot;Rapprochement Franco-Russe&quot;, Русско-Французское Сближение; &quot;Russko-Frantsuzskoye Sblizheniye&quot;), was an alliance formed by the agreements of 1891–94; it lasted until 1917. The strengthening of the German Empire, the creation of the Triple Alliance of 1882, and the exacerbation of Franco-German and Russo-German tensions at the end of the 1880s led to a common foreign policy and mutual strategic military interests between France and Russia. The development of financial ties between the two countries created the economic prerequisites for the Russo-French Alliance.


== The agreements ==
During a visit by a French squadron to Kronstadt in July 1891, the agreement of 1891 was concluded in the form of an exchange of letters between the ministers of foreign affairs. France was interested significantly more than Russia in a military alliance and endeavored to supplement the 1891 agreement with military obligations. As a result of the negotiations, the representatives of the Russian and French general staffs signed a military convention on August 17 (August 5 in Russian calendar), 1892, which provided for mutual military aid in the event of a German attack. By an exchange of letters between December 27 (December 15), 1893, and January 4, 1894 (December 23, 1893), both governments announced their ratification of the military convention. This formalized the Russo-French military-political alliance.

== History ==
The history of the alliance dates to the beginning of the 1870s, to the contradictions engendered by the Franco-Prussian War and the Treaty of Frankfurt of 1871. The Russian government had supported France during the war scare of 1875 when Russian and British protests forced Germany to stop threatening an attack on France. In 1876, the German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, attempted unsuccessfully to obtain from Russia a guarantee to preserve the territory of Alsace-Lorraine as part of Germany in exchange for unconditional support by Germany for Russian policy in the East. In 1877, during the new Franco-German war scare, Russia maintained friendly relations with France. However, after the Congress of Berlin in 1878, French diplomacy, in aiming at a rapprochement with Great Britain and Germany, assumed a hostile position vis-à-vis Russia. France&#x27;s alienation from Russia and her policy of colonial seizures lasted until 1885 when the Franco-German contradictions became heightened after the French victory in Annam. Early in 1887, new complications arose in Franco-German relations. France appealed to the Russian government for aid. In concluding the so-called Reinsurance Treaty with Germany in 1887, Russia insisted on maintaining for France the same conditions that Germany had stipulated for its ally, Austria-Hungary.

At the end of the 1880s, Russo-German economic discrepancies grew stronger. The Russo-French political rapprochement contributed to the influx of French capital into Russia. At the end of the 1880s and the beginning of the 1890s, Russia received a number of large loans from France. The deterioration of Russo-German relations, the resurrection of the Triple Alliance in 1891, and the rumors that Great Britain would join the alliance laid the grounds for the conclusion of a political agreement between Russia and France. It was a response to the formation of a military bloc (the Triple Alliance) headed by Germany. In Europe, two opposing hostile imperialist blocs had formed.
Relying on Russian support, France intensified its colonial policy. After the Fashoda Incident of 1898 with Great Britain, it endeavored even more to strengthen the alliance with Russia. The alliance with France also facilitated the tsarist government&#x27;s expansion into Manchuria in the 1890s. During the preparatory period and the first years of the existence of the Russo-French Alliance, the determining role was played by Russia, but in time the situation altered. By constantly receiving new loans from France, Russian tsarism gradually fell into financial dependence on French imperialism. Prior to World War I, the cooperation of the general staffs of both countries assumed closer forms. In 1912 a Russo-French naval convention was signed. Russia and France entered the war united by the treaty of alliance. This had a significant effect on the course and outcome of the war since it forced Germany from the first days of the war to fight on two fronts. This led to the defeat of Germany in the First Battle of the Marne, to the collapse of the Schlieffen Plan, and finally to the defeat of Germany. The Russo-French Alliance was nullified by the Bolshevik government in 1917.

<text>In genetics, chromosome translocation is a phenomenon that results in unusual rearrangement of chromosomes. This includes balanced and unbalanced translocation, with two main types: reciprocal, and Robertsonian translocation. Reciprocal translocation is a chromosome abnormality caused by exchange of parts between non-homologous chromosomes. Two detached fragments of two different chromosomes are switched. Robertsonian translocation occurs when two non-homologous chromosomes get attached, meaning that given two healthy pairs of chromosomes, one of each pair &quot;sticks&quot; and blends together homogeneously.

A gene fusion may be created when the translocation joins two otherwise-separated genes. It is detected on cytogenetics or a karyotype of affected cells. Translocations can be balanced (in an even exchange of material with no genetic information extra or missing, and ideally full functionality) or unbalanced (where the exchange of chromosome material is unequal resulting in extra or missing genes).

==Reciprocal translocations==
Reciprocal translocations are usually an &quot;exchange&quot; of material between non-homologous chromosomes and occur in about 1 in 491 live births. Such translocations are usually harmless, as they do not result in a gain or loss of genetic material, though they may be detected in prenatal diagnosis. However, carriers of balanced reciprocal translocations may create gametes with &quot;unbalanced&quot; chromosome translocations during meiotic chromosomal segregation. This can lead to infertility, miscarriages or children with abnormalities. Genetic counseling and genetic testing are often offered to families that may carry a translocation. Most balanced translocation carriers are healthy and do not have any symptoms.

It is important to distinguish between chromosomal translocations that occur in germ cells, due to errors in meiosis (i.e. during gametogenesis), and those that occur in somatic cells, due to errors in mitosis. The former results in a chromosomal abnormality featured in all cells of the offspring, as in translocation carriers. Somatic translocations, on the other hand, result in abnormalities featured only in the affected cell and its progenitors, as in chronic myelogenous leukemia with the Philadelphia chromosome translocation.

==Nonreciprocal translocation==

Nonreciprocal translocation involves the one-way transfer of genes from one chromosome to another nonhomologous chromosome.

==Robertsonian translocations==

Robertsonian translocation is a type of translocation caused by breaks at or near the centromeres of two acrocentric chromosomes. The reciprocal exchange of parts gives rise to one large metacentric chromosome and one extremely small chromosome that may be lost from the organism with little effect because it contains few genes. The resulting karyotype in humans leaves only 45 chromosomes, since two chromosomes have fused together. This has no direct effect on the phenotype, since the only genes on the short arms of acrocentrics are common to all of them and are present in variable copy number (nucleolar organiser genes).

Robertsonian translocations have been seen involving all combinations of acrocentric chromosomes. The most common translocation in humans involves chromosomes 13 and 14 and is seen in about 0.97 / 1000 newborns. Carriers of Robertsonian translocations are not associated with any phenotypic abnormalities, but there is a risk of unbalanced gametes that lead to miscarriages or abnormal offspring. For example, carriers of Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 21 have a higher risk of having a child with Down syndrome. This is known as a &#x27;translocation Downs&#x27;. This is due to a mis-segregation (nondisjunction) during gametogenesis. The mother has a higher (10%) risk of transmission than the father (1%). Robertsonian translocations involving chromosome 14 also carry a slight risk of uniparental disomy 14 due to trisomy rescue.

==Role in disease==
Some human diseases caused by translocations are:
* Cancer: Several forms of cancer are caused by acquired translocations (as opposed to those present from conception); this has been described mainly in leukemia (acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia). Translocations have also been described in solid malignancies such as Ewing&#x27;s sarcoma.
* Infertility: One of the would-be parents carries a &quot;balanced translocation&quot;, where the parent is asymptomatic but conceived fetuses are not viable.
* Down syndrome is caused in a minority (5% or less) of cases by a Robertsonian translocation of the chromosome 21 long arm onto the long arm of chromosome 14.

Chromosomal translocations between the sex chromosomes can also result in a number of genetic conditions, such as
* XX male syndrome: caused by a translocation of the SRY gene from the Y to the X chromosome

==By chromosome==
===Denotation===
The International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) is used to denote a translocation between chromosomes. The designation t(A;B)(p1;q2) is used to denote a translocation between chromosome A and chromosome B. The information in the second set of parentheses, when given, gives the precise location within the chromosome for chromosomes A and B respectively—with &quot;p&quot; indicating the short arm of the chromosome, &quot;q&quot; indicating the long arm, and the numbers after p or q refers to regions, bands and sub-bands seen when staining the chromosome with a staining dye. See also the definition of a genetic locus.

The translocation is the mechanism that can cause a gene to move from one linkage group to another.

===Examples of translocations on human chromosomes===


==History==
In 1938, Karl Sax, at the Harvard University Biological Laboratories, published a paper entitled &quot;Chromosome Aberrations Induced by X-rays&quot;, which demonstrated that radiation could induce major genetic changes by affecting chromosomal translocations. The paper is thought to mark the beginning of the field of radiation cytology, and led him to be called &quot;the father of radiation cytology&quot;.

==DNA double-strand break repair==

The initiating event in the formation of a translocation is generally a double-strand break in chromosomal DNA. A type of DNA repair that has a major role in generating chromosomal translocations is the non-homologous end joining pathway. When this pathway functions appropriately it restores a DNA double-strand break by reconnecting the originally broken ends, but when it acts inappropriately it may join ends incorrectly resulting in genomic rearrangements including translocations. In order for the illegitimate joining of broken ends to occur, the exchange partners DNAs need to be physically close to each other in the 3D genome.

<doc id="560504" wikidata="Q1130112" url="?curid=560504" title="Cradle of Humankind">
<text>The Cradle of Humankind is a paleoanthropological site that is located about northwest of Johannesburg, South Africa, in the Gauteng province. Declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999, the site is home to the largest known concentration of human ancestral remains anywhere in the world. The site currently occupies and contains a complex system of limestone caves. The registered name of the site in the list of World Heritage Sites is Fossil Hominid Sites of South Africa.

According to the &quot;South African Journal of Science&quot;, Bolt&#x27;s Farm is the place where the earliest primates were discovered. Bolt&#x27;s Farm was heavily mined for speleothem (calcium carbonate from stalagmites, stalactites, and flowstones) in the terminal nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The Sterkfontein Caves were the site of the discovery of a 2.3-million-year-old fossil &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; (nicknamed &quot;Mrs. Ples&quot;), found in 1947 by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson. The find helped corroborate the 1924 discovery by Raymond Dart of the juvenile &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; skull known as the &quot;Taung Child&quot; at Taung in the North West Province of South Africa, where excavations still continue.

Nearby, but not in the site, the Rising Star Cave system contains the Dinaledi Chamber (chamber of stars), in which were discovered fifteen fossil skeletons of an extinct species of hominin, provisionally named &quot;Homo naledi&quot;.

Sterkfontein alone has produced more than a third of early hominid fossils found prior to 2010. The Dinaledi Chamber contains more than 1,500 &quot;H. naledi&quot; bone specimens from at least 15 individuals, the most extensive discovery of a single hominid species ever found in Africa.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Cradle of Humankind&quot; reflects the fact that the site has produced a substantially large number of hominin fossils, some of the oldest yet found, dating as far back as 3.5 million years ago.

== History of discoveries ==
In 1935, Robert Broom found the first human fossils at Sterkfontein and began work at this site. In 1938, a young schoolboy, Gert Terrblanche, brought Raymond Dart fragments of a skull from nearby Kromdraai that later were identified as &quot;Paranthropus robustus&quot;. Also in 1938, a single human tooth was found at the Cooper&#x27;s Cave site between Kromdraai and Sterkfontein. 

In 1948, the Camp-Peabody Expedition from the United States worked at Bolts Farm and Gladysvale looking for fossil hominids, but failed to find any. Later in 1948, Robert Broom identified the first hominid remains from Swartkrans cave. 

In 1954, C. K. Brain began working at sites in the Cradle, including Cooper&#x27;s Cave. He then initiated his three-decade work at Swartkrans cave, which resulted in the recovery of the second-largest sample of hominid remains from the Cradle. The oldest controlled use of fire by Homo erectus also was discovered at Swartkrans and dated to more than 1 million years ago.

In 1966, Phillip Tobias began his excavations of Sterkfontein that are still continuing and are the longest continuously running fossil excavations in the world. 

In 1991, Lee Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand discovered the first hominid specimens from the Gladysvale site, making it the first new early hominid site to be discovered in South Africa in 48 years. In 1994, Andre Keyser discovered fossil hominids at the site of Drimolen. In 1997, Kevin Kuykendall and Colin Menter of the University of the Witwatersrand found two fossil hominid teeth at the site of Gondolin. Also in 1997, the near-complete &quot;Australopithecus&quot; skeleton of &quot;Little Foot&quot;, then dated to approximately 3.3 million years ago (more recent dating suggests it is closer to 2.5 million years ago), was discovered by Ron Clarke. 

In 2001, Steve Churchill of Duke University and Lee Berger found early modern human remains at Plovers Lake. Also in 2001, the first hominid fossils and stone tools were discovered &quot;in-situ&quot; at Cooper&#x27;s Cave. In 2008, Lee Berger discovered the partial remains of two hominids (&quot;Australopithecus sediba&quot;) who lived between 1.78 and 1.95 million years ago in the Malapa Fossil Site.

In October 2013, Berger commissioned geologist Pedro Boshoff to investigate cave systems in the Cradle of Humankind for the express purpose of discovering more fossil hominin sites. Cavers Rick Hunter and Steven Tucker discovered hominid fossils in a previously unexplored area of the Rising Star-Westminster Cave System that is assigned site designation UW-101. In November 2013, Berger led a joint expedition of the University of the Witwatersrand and National Geographic Society to the Rising Star Cave System near Swartkrans. In just three weeks of excavation, the six-woman international team of advance speleological scientists (K. Lindsay Eaves, Marina Elliott, Elen Feuerriegel, Alia Gurtov, Hannah Morris, and Becca Peixotto), chosen for their paleoanthropological and caving skills, as well as their small size, recovered more than 1,200 fossil specimens of an unidentified hominin species. As of 2015, the site remained in the process of being dated. In September 2015, Berger, in collaboration with National Geographic, announced the discovery of a new species of human relative, named &quot;Homo naledi&quot;, from UW-101. Most remarkably, besides shedding light on the origins and diversity of the Homo genus, &quot;H. naledi&quot; also appears to have intentionally deposited bodies of its dead in a remote cave chamber, a behaviour previously thought limited to later Homo species. In the last days of the Rising Star Expedition, cavers Rick Hunter and Steven Tucker discovered additional fossil hominid material in another portion of the cave system. Preliminary excavations at this site, designated UW-102, had begun by 2013 and yielded complete hominid fossil material of its own. The relationship of site 101 to 102 is not known.

== Geological context ==
The hominin remains that fossilised over time at the Cradle of Humankind are found in dolomitic caves, and are often encased in a mixture of limestone and other sediments called breccia. Early hominids may have lived throughout Africa, but their remains are found only at sites where conditions allowed for the formation and preservation of fossils.

== Visitor centres ==
On 7 December 2005, South African President Thabo Mbeki opened the new Maropeng Visitors Centre at the site. Per the maropeng.co.za website, visitors may see fossils, view stone tools, and learn about the birth of humankind in the visitors centre. The visitors centre also offers a tour of the Sterkfontein Caves and the exhibition at Sterkfontein. A light, moveable, steel structure known as the Beetle has been placed over the Malapa site, to allow the paying public to view excavations, once they resume at the site. (Digging has been on hold since 2009, when the remains of four &quot;A. sediba&quot; individuals were removed.)

<doc id="560507" wikidata="Q12064429" url="?curid=560507" title="North Toronto">
<text>North Toronto is a former town and informal district located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Town of North Toronto was incorporated in 1890 by consolidating the villages of Bedford Park, Eglinton and Davisville. The town was annexed by Toronto in 1912. The name is still used to refer to the area in general, although Yonge–Eglinton and Midtown Toronto are officially used.

The former town was bounded on the south by Moore Avenue east to Bayview Avenue, north to Eglinton Avenue, west to Bruce, north to Fairfield, west to the west boundary of Mount Hope Cemetery, then north to north of Glen Echo, west to Yonge, north to north of McNairn Avenue, then west to a line just west of Elm Road. The boundary continues south to just north of Glenview Avenue and Avenue Road, then west to a line with Proudfoot Avenue, then south to just north of Briar Hill, then south on Castlewood to Roselawn, then south on Latimer to Eglinton Avenue. The boundary continues east on Eglinton to Elmsthorpe, then south to the former rail line south of Chaplin Crescent, then east to Yonge.

==Origins==
Toronto&#x27;s Yonge streetcar line was then extended along Yonge Street through North Toronto, replacing the Metropolitan line, the former radial railway service. North Toronto soon emerged as a popular streetcar suburb, with the area becoming completely developed by the 1940s. The streetcar was replaced in 1954 by the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s Yonge subway as far as Eglinton Avenue and a trolleybus running north from there, which was replaced in turn by a subway extension in 1973. Today North Toronto is a relatively affluent community, and very popular with young families.

==Character==
The neighbourhood has had a mixed-density design for some time, but this is rapidly changing to a greater density with the construction of residential condominium buildings in the area. The southern part of the neighbourhood is densely populated, with the entire section between Yonge Street and Mount Pleasant Road south of Davisville Avenue built up with high rise apartment buildings. More recently, condo buildings have further added to this density, especially south of Merton Street (backing onto historic Mount Pleasant Cemetery). Additional condo developments have begun on Mount Pleasant Road, and the existing medium-rise dwellings southeast of Yonge and Eglinton have been joined by developer Minto&#x27;s Quantum towers of 37 and 54 stories.

Mount Pleasant Cemetery serves as a major green space for the southern end of the neighbourhood. South of the cemetery are trails in two ravines of the former Mud Creek and Yellow Creek, which lead to the Don River. On the north side of the cemetery is the Beltline Trail, a heavily used pedestrian and cycling path on the route of a former railway line. The Belt Line Railway was a short-lived commuter route in the 1890s. It was subsequently purchased by Canadian National Railway and used for freight until service was discontinued in the 1960s. The path goes northwest to Eglinton Avenue, then curves west, and ends at the William R. Allen Road, known locally as the Allen Expressway. Other green spaces includes Eglinton Park just west of Yonge Street and Alexander Muir Memorial Gardens at Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue, which connects to Sherwood Ravine Park and Sunnybrook Park to the east.
North Toronto is served by north–south commercial strips on Yonge Street, Mount Pleasant Road, and Bayview Avenue, and an east–west strip on Eglinton Avenue. These offer an array of shopping and dining aimed primarily at the local market, and as with many main streets in Toronto neighbourhoods, are largely given to small, locally owned shops in free-standing buildings. The corner of Yonge and Eglinton features the Yonge Eglinton Centre complex, which includes a shopping mall, multiplex cinema, and both office and residential towers; and Canada Square, an office complex with a small shopping concourse and another, older multiplex. Both are connected to Eglinton subway station. The headquarters of Canadian Tire, TVOntario, RioCan, Heart and Stroke Foundation and the Toronto Transit Commission are located in North Toronto.

Libraries can be found on Bayview Avenue, at Yonge and Lawrence, and near Yonge and Eglinton, along with a children&#x27;s-focused library on Mount Pleasant. There are two community centres in North Toronto; Central Eglinton Community Centre, at Eglinton and Redpath, offers a wide variety of programs and services for caregivers &amp; young children, adults. and people 50+. North Toronto Memorial Community Centre is located at Eglinton Park (Eglinton Avenue and Oriole Parkway). What was once North America&#x27;s largest bridge club, Kate Buckman&#x27;s, was on Mount Pleasant near Eglinton for many years until its closure in 2007; the Toronto Bridge Club is on St. Clair near Yonge. The Toronto Camera Club finds its home on Mount Pleasant Road near Millwood Road.

==Neighbourhoods==
North Toronto is composed of a number of distinct neighbourhoods. It has more recently also become synonymous with Midtown.

<doc id="560508" wikidata="Q5359570" url="?curid=560508" title="China lobby in the United States">
<text>In American politics, the China lobby (Chinese: 中國遊說團) consisted of advocacy groups calling for American support for the Republic of China during the period from the 1930s until US recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1979, and then calling for closer ties with the PRC thereafter.

After 1945, the term &quot;China lobby&quot; was used most often to refer to groups favoring the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan in opposition to Mao Zedong&#x27;s communist government in Beijing. They opposed the 1972 Nixon visit to mainland China, and the American recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1979. The small Chinese American community largely shared a similar pro-ROC perspective. Since that time, the support for mainland China has greatly strengthened.

==History==

===Cold War period===

The Committee of One Million Against the Admission of Red China to the United Nations, later changed its name to The Committee of One Million Against the Admission of Communist China to the United Nations. The committee was established by Marvin Liebman, a political activist. Congressman Walter Judd (1898–1994) was an important spokesman for the Lobby. The China Lobby was funded by the Kuomintang through T. V. Soong, one of the wealthiest people in the world, brother-in-law of Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Republic of China (Taiwan).

It was the dominant lobby on China issues until the 1970s. During the 1970s, the China Lobby campaigned furiously to prevent American recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), but its efforts proved to be unsuccessful. Richard Nixon opened the door to mainland China in 1972 and the PRC was recognized by the United States in 1979.

===Deng Xiaoping period===

In 1979, the Taiwan Relations Act was signed by President Carter, which committed the United States to provide military and other support for Taiwan and provided guidelines for future trade and other relations.

In 1980, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping launched the so-called &quot;Reform and Opening&quot; policies. Deng Xiaoping embarked on a major process of economic changes, and pressed the U.S. to open trade relations. One of the main aspects of this was opening the doors to international trade and business. China lobbied to gain business from the United States, and companies began to flock to China to take advantage of the new opportunities made possible by trade laws. China was invited to join the IMF and World Bank.

In 1982, after additional negotiations concerning coordinating positions regarding the Soviet Union and Taiwan, the United States and China released another joint communiqué, the Third Communiqué, by which the United States agreed to reduce its arms sales to Taiwan and China agreed to emphasize a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue. The next year, Deng Xiaoping proposed the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; approach for unification with both Hong Kong and Taiwan.

In 1986, China joined the Asian Development Bank and applied for membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). The United States at the time did not support China&#x27;s entry into the latter two organizations because of reservations about the degree of openness of China&#x27;s economy.

In 1989, in the aftermath of the Chinese military crackdown on demonstrations in Beijing&#x27;s Tiananmen Square in the spring, the United States and other nations imposed economic sanctions on China, and many U.S. citizens evacuated the country. President George H.W. Bush maintained communications with senior Chinese leaders, though tensions continued into the next year, with criticisms aired from both sides. Diplomatic ties were never severed and China remained open to foreign trade.

===Post-Deng Xiaoping period===

In 1992, the first high-level contacts in several years occurred when President George H.W. Bush and Chinese Premier Li Peng met on the sidelines of a U.N. conference. President Bush maintained support for Taiwan by authorizing new arms sales and dispatching a Special Trade Representative to the island.

President Clinton had in 1993 tied the annual review of Most Favored Nation trading status to China&#x27;s record on human rights, a decision that was in keeping with popular opinion on China. When this status came up for renewal the next year, Clinton reversed this position and granted China MFN without requiring any changes regarding human rights.

In 1998, President Bill Clinton agreed that the United States held to a &quot;three no’s policy&quot; regarding Taiwan. By this he meant that the United States does not support Taiwan&#x27;s independence, &quot;two Chinas&quot; or &quot;one China, one Taiwan&quot; policies, or Taiwan&#x27;s membership in international organizations where statehood is required.

Late in 1999 in the year, after lobbying by China, the two sides finally came to an agreement and China was able to join the WTO. The annual debate over China&#x27;s trading status within the United States was ended when President Clinton decided to grant China permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR, formerly MFN).

===21st century===

In the first decade of the twenty-first century, the PRC lobby has focused on playing up common interests with the United States in the War on Terrorism. The PRC lobby has also tried to counter the domestic American interest groups which seek to bring pressure upon the PRC to move from a fixed currency to a floating currency.

Neil Bush, son of George H. W. Bush (who had been instrumental in opening China to U.S. investment and bilateral trade as the Ambassador to the PRC) in 2011 incorporated an accounting firm called LehmanBush with veteran China lawyer Edward Lehman. In 2002, Bush signed a consulting contract that paid $2 million in stock over five years to work for Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., a firm backed by Jiang Mianheng, the son of former General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Jiang Zemin, plus $10,000 for every board meeting he attends.

By the late 2010s great power rivalry between the United States and China eclipsed previously supportive policies towards China in the United States. As a part of this trend, American business leaders, concerned over both market access and business revenue, began facing dilemmas regarding closer scrutiny from American officials over the Foreign Agents Registration Act and lobbying requests from the Chinese government on American legislation that the Chinese government perceived as hostile. Consequentially, the U.S.-China Business Council and the United States of America-China Chamber of Commerce have gone relatively silent compared to previous years when China enjoyed widespread support within American political circles when it joined the WTO.

<doc id="560511" wikidata="Q174153" url="?curid=560511" title="Stripes (film)">
<text>Stripes is a 1981 American action comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman and starring Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Warren Oates, P. J. Soles, Sean Young, and John Candy. Ramis wrote the film with Len Blum and Dan Goldberg, the latter of whom also served as producer alongside Reitman. It tells the story of an immature taxi cab driver and his teacher friend who enlist in the United States Army with comical results. Numerous actors, including John Larroquette, John Diehl, Conrad Dunn, Judge Reinhold, Joe Flaherty, Dave Thomas, Timothy Busfield, and Bill Paxton, appear in the film in some of the earliest roles of their careers. The film&#x27;s score was composed by Elmer Bernstein. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and audiences, and was a commercial success.

==Plot==

In the course of one day, Louisville, Kentucky cab driver John Winger loses his job, his apartment, his car, and his girlfriend Anita, who has grown tired of his immaturity. Realizing his limited prospects, he decides to join the Army and persuades best friend Russell Ziskey, a vocational ESL teacher, to join as well. The two visit a recruiting office and are sent to basic training.

Upon arrival, they meet their fellow recruits and their drill sergeant, Sergeant Hulka. Following in-processing, the recruits introduce themselves and explain their reasons for enlisting. One of them, the overweight Dewey &quot;Ox&quot; Oxberger, wants to slim down and be respected. John irritates Hulka with his slacker attitude, and he and Russell become romantically involved with MPs Louise Cooper and Stella Hansen.

After Hulka discovers that John and Russell have briefly gone AWOL, Russell confesses his mistake, but John keeps silent. Hulka orders Russell to scrub garbage cans for 24 hours and gives the rest of the platoon two weeks of KP duty. That night, Russell catches John attempting to desert and stops him, angrily reminding John that it was his idea that they both enlist. Louise and Stella find them fighting and drive them back to their barracks without reporting them.

As graduation approaches, Hulka is injured when Captain Stillman, the recruit company&#x27;s commanding officer, orders a mortar crew to fire without first setting target coordinates. Later, members of Hulka&#x27;s platoon sneak off base and visit a mud wrestling bar. When MPs and police raid the club, Stella and Louise help John and Russell escape. The rest of the platoon are returned to base, where Stillman reprimands them for being arrested and threatens to report them to the base commander, General Barnicke, and make them repeat basic training.

John and Russell have sex with Stella and Louise, then return to base. John motivates the disheartened platoon with a speech and begins preparing them for graduation. After a night of practice, they oversleep and wake up an hour late for the ceremony. They rush to the parade ground, where John leads them in an unorthodox but highly coordinated drill display. Impressed upon learning that they completed their training without a drill sergeant, Barnicke assigns them to a secret project in Italy.

Upon arrival in Italy, the platoon is reunited with a recovered Hulka and tasked with guarding the EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle, an armored personnel carrier disguised as a recreational vehicle. John and Russell steal it to visit Stella and Louise, who are stationed in West Germany. When Stillman finds the vehicle missing, he launches an unauthorized mission to retrieve it.

Stillman inadvertently leads the platoon across the border into Czechoslovakia. Hulka jumps from their truck before the Soviet Army captures it and sends out a radio distress call that John and Russell hear. John, Russell, Stella, and Louise take the EM-50 and infiltrate the Soviet base where the platoon is being held, rescuing them with aid from Hulka.

Upon returning to the US, John, Russell, Louise, Stella, and Hulka are hailed as heroes and are each awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Hulka retires from the Army and opens a fast food restaurant; John, Russell, Ox, Stella, and Louise are featured on magazine covers; and Stillman is reassigned to a weather station in Nome, Alaska.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
En route to the premiere of &quot;Meatballs&quot;, Ivan Reitman conceived an idea for a film: &quot;Cheech and Chong join the army&quot;. He pitched &quot;Stripes&quot; to Paramount Pictures, who immediately greenlit the film. Len Blum and Dan Goldberg wrote the screenplay in Toronto and read it to Reitman, who was in Los Angeles, over the phone, who in turn would give the writers notes. Cheech and Chong&#x27;s manager thought the script was very funny; however, the comedy duo wanted complete creative control. Reitman then suggested to Goldberg that they change the two main characters to ones suited for Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, figuring that if they could interest Ramis and let him tailor the script for the two of them, he could convince Murray to do it.

===Casting===
Ramis had already co-written &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, &quot;Meatballs&quot;, and &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, but was relatively unknown as a film actor. His best-known acting work prior to &quot;Stripes&quot; was as a cast member for the late-night TV sketch comedy &quot;Second City Television&quot;, which he had quit a few years earlier. Columbia Pictures did not like Ramis&#x27;s audition but Reitman told the studio that he was hiring the comedian anyway. P. J. Soles reported that Dennis Quaid had read for the role of Russell and that Ramis was reluctant to appear in the film, but that Murray told Ramis he did not wish to work with anyone else and would leave the film unless he played the other principal.

Casting director Karen Rea saw Conrad Dunn on the stage and asked him to read for the role of Francis &quot;Psycho&quot; Soyer in New York. Judge Reinhold played Elmo, who was given the best jokes from the Cheech and Chong draft of the screenplay. Sean Young was cast based on her looks, and Reitman felt that her &quot;sweetness&quot; would go well with Ramis. According to Reitman, Kim Basinger agreed to play Stella but her agent demanded way too much money. Three-hundred actresses were also considered for the role. P. J. Soles tested with Murray and they got along well together. John Diehl had never auditioned before and won his first paying job as an actor. Goldberg knew John Candy from Toronto and told Reitman that he should be in the film; he was not required to audition.

Reitman was a fan of the Westerns that Warren Oates had been in and wanted someone who was strong and whom everyone respected to control the film&#x27;s misfit platoon. Reinhold said that during filming Oates would tell stories about working on films like &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; and they would be enthralled. Reitman wanted &quot;a little bit of weight in the center&quot;, and added the argument between Hulka and Winger. It was not played for laughs and allowed Murray to do a serious scene, something he had not done before. During filming one of the obstacle courses scenes, Reitman told the actors to grab Oates and drag him into the mud without telling the veteran actor about it to see what would happen and get a genuine reaction. Oates&#x27; front tooth got chipped in the process and he yelled at Reitman for what he did.

===Filming===
Every scene had some element of improvisation due in large part to Murray and Ramis. Much of the mud wrestling scene was made up on the spot by Reitman. Candy felt uncomfortable during filming, but Reitman talked him through it. The spatula scene in the kitchen of the general&#x27;s house was filmed at three in the morning, after the cast and crew had been up the entire day. Murray improvised the &quot;Aunt Jemima Treatment&quot; sequence and Soles reacted naturally to whatever he said and did.

Filming began in Kentucky in November 1980, then moved to California in December. Principal photography ended on Stage 20 at Burbank Studios on January 29, 1981. The production was allowed to shoot the army scenes at Fort Knox, the city scenes in Louisville, and the Czechoslovakia scenes at the closed Chapeze Distillery (owned by Jim Beam) in Clermont, with a budget of $9–10million and a 42-day shooting schedule. Reitman, Goldberg, and Ramis were involved in a detailed negotiation with the Department of Defense to make the film conducive to the recruiting needs of the military, in exchange for subsidies in the form of free labor and location and equipment access.

Soles said that the scene where Stella and Winger share their first kiss was supposed be outdoors but it started raining.

Dunn remembered Candy inviting the men in the platoon to his house while filming was under way, for a homemade spaghetti dinner and to watch the famous Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Roberto Durán II No Más Fight (November 25, 1980). He recalled that he and Candy were the only two cast members who knew the lyrics to the song &quot;Doo Wah Diddy&quot; and taught them to the rest of the company. &quot;I really enjoyed playing Psycho&quot;, he said.

In 1993 Murray reflected, &quot;I&#x27;m still a little queasy that I actually made a movie where I carry a machine gun. But I felt if you were rescuing your friends it was okay. It wasn&#x27;t &quot;Reds&quot; or anything, but it captured what it was like on an Army base: It was cold, you had to wear the same green clothes, you had to do a lot of physical stuff, you got treated pretty badly, and had bad coffee.&quot;

The EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle &quot;was built from a 1973-1978-era GMC Motorhome,&quot;. It was designed to resemble &quot;a family Winnebago — with a nice color scheme and user-friendly interior — but came with bulletproof shields and flamethrowers.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Stripes&quot; was released on June 26, 1981, and grossed $1,892,000 in 1,074 screens on opening day. It placed fifth overall for the weekend with $6,152,166. It eventually grossed $85,297,000 in North America, making it the fifth most popular 1981 film at the US and Canadian box office.

===Critical response===
&quot;Stripes&quot; was well received by critics and audiences. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 41 reviews, with a rating average of 6.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A raucous military comedy that features Bill Murray and his merry cohorts approaching the peak of their talents.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In his &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; review, Roger Ebert praised it as &quot;an anarchic slob movie, a celebration of all that is irreverent, reckless, foolhardy, undisciplined, and occasionally scatological. It&#x27;s a lot of fun.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a lazy but amiable comedy&quot; and praised Murray for achieving &quot;a sardonically exaggerated calm that can be very entertaining&quot;.

Gary Arnold, in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, wrote, &quot;&quot;Stripes&quot; squanders at least an hour belaboring situations contradicted from the outset by Murray&#x27;s personality. The premise and star remain out of whack until the rambling, diffuse screenplay finally struggles beyond basic training.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Stripes&quot; will keep potential felons off the streets for two hours. Few people seem to be asking, these days, that movies do more.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;Stripes&quot; was released on VHS by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video.

In 1983 the film was released on LaserDisc (Extended Play, CLV, Constant Linear Velocity).

The film was released on DVD on June 7, 2005, a release which includes both the original theatrical cut and an extended cut that runs about 18 minutes longer than the theatrical cut. Extra features include six deleted scenes; audio commentary by Reitman and Goldberg; an hour-long documentary titled &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; that includes the reminiscences of the screenwriters, Reitman, Diehl, Laroquette, Murray, Reinhold, Soles and Young; and the original trailer.

The extended cut expands on several scenes and includes an excised subplot in which Winger and Ziskey (who takes six hits of Elmo&#x27;s LSD under the impression that it is Dramamine) go AWOL by stowing away on a special forces paratrooper mission. They become lost in a jungle and are captured by Spanish-speaking guerrillas. They are taken to camp and nearly shot before Winger saves the day by singing the chorus of Tito Rodriguez&#x27;s &quot;Quando, Quando, Quando&quot;, effectively winning over their captors. Winger and Ziskey then leave and rejoin the special forces unit as it is re-boarding the plane. Other deleted scenes include a longer sequence of Winger talking Ziskey into joining the Army with him; Captain Stillman being called out as a liar by Winger when he blames another officer for his neglect in the mortar incident that injured Sgt. Hulka; Hulka giving everyone but John and Russell the weekend off in Italy while assigning them to guard and clean the EM-50, explaining cheerfully that his only reason for doing so is that he doesn&#x27;t like John; and Russell saying he won&#x27;t go rescue the platoon because he doesn&#x27;t want to kill OR die while John warms up to the idea of mounting a rescue via the EM-50. The last two deleted scenes notably have John Winger being told that the platoon members dislike him (indirectly by Hulka, and directly by Russell when he tells John that the platoon hates his guts) which is in contrast to the positive reactions to Winger in the final act of the theatrically released film.

In January 2012, the extended cut of the film was released on Blu-ray.

==Re-release==
For the 40th anniversary of the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Stripes&quot; re-opened in theaters on August 29 to September 2, 2021, with a special introduction from Bill Murray and Ivan Reitman.

<doc id="560518" wikidata="Q166232" url="?curid=560518" title="Kenmare">
<text>Kenmare () is a small town in the south of County Kerry, Ireland. The name Kenmare is the anglicised form of &quot;Ceann Mara&quot;, meaning &quot;head of the sea&quot;, referring to the head of Kenmare Bay. It is also a townland and civil parish.

==Location==
Kenmare is located at the head of Kenmare Bay (where it reaches the farthest inland), sometimes called the Kenmare River, where the Roughty River (&quot;An Ruachtach&quot;) flows into the sea, and at the junction of the Iveragh Peninsula and the Beara Peninsula. It is also located near the MacGillycuddy&#x27;s Reeks, Mangerton Mountain and Caha Mountains and is a popular hillwalking destination. Nearby towns and villages are Tuosist, Ardgroom, Glengarriff, Kilgarvan, Killarney, Templenoe and Sneem.

Kenmare is in the Kerry constituency of Dáil Éireann.

==History==
Evidence of ancient settlement in the Kenmare area includes one of the largest stone circles in the south-west of Ireland. Close to the town, this stone circle shows occupation in the area going back to at least the Bronze Age (2,200–500 B.C), when it was constructed. The circle has 15 stones around the circumference with a boulder dolmen in the centre.

Vikings are said to have raided the area around the town which at that time was called &quot;Ceann Mhara&quot;, which means &quot;head of the sea&quot; in Irish.

The entire area was granted to the English economist and scientist Sir William Petty by Oliver Cromwell as part payment for completing the mapping of Ireland, the Down Survey in 1656. He laid out the modern town circa 1670. Before him, a previous surveyor of Ireland, Sir Valentine Browne (1510–1589), ancestor of the Earl of Kenmare, was granted some lands in County Kerry during the resulting plantation, the Munster Plantation.

The three main streets that form a triangle in the centre of the town are called Main Street (originally William Street, after Sir William, 1st. Marquis of Lansdowne), Henry Street (originally Sound Road), after the son of William the 1st. Marquis and Shelbourne Street (Henry Petty became the first Earl of Shelburne). This name was also later applied to Shelbourne Road in Dublin.

The convent in the town, the Poor Clare Sisters, was founded in 1861 when five nuns including Sister Mary Frances Cusack (The Nun of Kenmare), who was also an author and publisher of many books, moved to Kenmare from their convent in Newry, County Down. Under the guidance of Mother Abbess O&#x27;Hagan in 1864 a lace-working industry was established and Kenmare lace became noted worldwide. The convent no longer exists and Pobalscoil Inbhear Scéine secondary school occupies this site since 2001.

A suspension bridge, which is claimed to be the first in Ireland, over the Kenmare River was opened in 1841 and served the community till 1932 when it was replaced by a new concrete bridge.

During and after the Civil War (1922–1923), there were a number of incidents in Kenmare, including the killing of O&#x27;Connor brothers in September 1922 by the Anti-Treaty IRA, and the brutal assault against the allegedly Unionist daughters of a local doctor by three Dublin Guard officers led by Paddy Daly in 1923 (which is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Kenmare incident&#x27;). Kenmare was briefly held by the Anti-Treaty IRA, during the Irish Civil War, before being successfully retaken by the Irish Army in December 1922.

The town library is one of the Carnegie Libraries funded by Andrew Carnegie. It opened in 1918, and the architect was R.M. Butler. The library building is now home to the Carnegie Arts Centre and theatre, hosting a local drama group and a number of travelling productions each year, as well as music and comedy nights.

Holy Cross Catholic Church in Kenmare was consecrated in 1864. It was built under the guidance of Archdeacon Fr. John O&#x27;Sullivan – who is interred within the church. The church has stained glass windows by O&#x27;Connor London (1863), by Caseys Dublin (1864) and by Earley Dublin (1864). The organ is by Telford &amp; Telford(1865). Buried in the church grounds is Monsignor Francis Cremin (died 2001), who was a periitus or theological expert at Vatican II. He was a native of Kenmare and had been Professor of Canon Law and Moral Theology at St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth from 1949 until 1980. He was a brother of Con Cremin, an Irish diplomat, who represented Ireland in France and Germany during World War II and subsequently in Portugal, the Holy See, the United Kingdom and at the United Nations.
The Church of Ireland church of St Patrick celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2008. The town has been a winner in the Irish Tidy Towns Competition in 2013, 2000 and was a runner-up in 2003 and 2008.

==Tourism==

Kenmare lies on two noted Irish tourist routes, the Ring of Kerry and the Ring of Beara, approximately from Killarney. As a result, it is a popular tourist destination and many of the businesses in the area cater to tourists. The town is noted for its food and pubs.

Since the late 1990s the tourism industry has driven local construction work, with land being sold at high prices to developers wishing to build estates of holiday homes. This has led to an increase in the town&#x27;s population, particularly during the peak tourist season, and prompted fears among some residents that the town is becoming overdeveloped and losing much of its identity.

== Notable people ==

Inter-county Gaelic footballers Mickey &#x27;Ned&#x27; O&#x27;Sullivan, Stephen O&#x27;Brien and Paul O&#x27;Connor are from the Kenmare area, while Pat Spillane is from nearby Templenoe. Kenmare is also the home of Irish Olympic slalom skier Thos Foley.

Kenmare was home to composer Ernest John Moeran for a number of years up to his death and a local bar was named after him – but has since been renamed. Diplomat Con Cremin was also from Kenmare, as is senator Mark Daly. Writer Anna McPartlin grew up in Kenmare, and her 2007 novel &quot;Apart from the Crowd&quot; was set in the town.

Francis Brennan is the owner of the five-star Park Hotel in Kenmare. He and his brother John, owner of the nearby Dromquinna Manor Hotel in Templenoe, are known for their TV series &quot;At Your Service&quot;.

==Fair days==
Due to its location at the centre of a large agricultural area, Kenmare served as the local market town. Until the establishment of an auction mart in the early 1990s, the approximately monthly &quot;fair days&quot; were a time when farmers would &quot;stand&quot; their animals in the streets for sale to visiting stock dealers. The only fair which continues to be held is that of 15 August, which coincides with the Catholic holy day of obligation marking the Assumption of Mary. The day attracts crowds of locals and visitors and is the busiest day of the year in Kenmare.

==Transport==

There are daily bus-services in summer to Killarney and in the off-season, the bus runs Monday-Friday. There is also a daily service to/from Cork in the summer months on the N71 via Bantry, Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bandon. In mid-2023, a new service from Killarney to Skibbereen via Kenmare was announced, replacing the previous Killarney to Kenmare and Kenmare to Skibbereen services with additional journeys and extended hours.

The N71 also connects Kenmare to Killarney on a mountainous and scenic part of the Ring of Kerry route via Moll&#x27;s Gap and Ladies View. Alternatively one can reach Killarney via the slightly longer but more comfortable route through Kilgarvan. Kenmare also lies on the N71 national secondary road south-Cork route to Glengarriff. In November 2014, the Eastern Relief Road was opened, allowing drivers from the R569 Kilgarvan Road to bypass the town centre when accessing the supermarkets and schools.

Kenmare railway station opened, in October 1893, as the terminus of a branch from the Great Southern and Western Railway&#x27;s Mallow–Tralee line at Headford Junction. The station closed, along with the branch, in early 1960 and the last passenger train ran on 1 February 1960. The track was lifted shortly afterwards.

==Services==
The town has a primary and secondary school, a public library, community hospital, as well as Catholic, Church of Ireland and Methodist churches.

==Sports==
The GAA club, Kenmare Shamrocks, competes in Kerry GAA competitions. George Mayberry from Kenmare participated in the 1908 Summer Olympics.

Kenmare Kestrels Basketball Club was founded in 2006 and competes in the Kerry Area Basketball League.

The local soccer team Inter Kenmare F.C. competes in the Kerry District League at U17, Youth &amp; Senior Men&#x27;s/Women&#x27;s level and in the Kerry Schoolboys/girls League for all underage teams.

Overlooking Kenmare Bay and adjacent to the Park Hotel is the 18 hole, Kenmare Golf Club.

==In popular culture==
In the fictional &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe, Kenmare is home to the &quot;Kenmare Kestrels&quot;, one of only thirteen Quidditch teams that play in the Quidditch League of Britain and Ireland. The team players wear emerald-green robes emblazoned with two yellow K&#x27;s across the chest.

The eponymous song &quot;As I leave behind Neidín&quot; was written by Jimmy McCarthy and recorded by Mary Black amongst others.

The town was also referenced in the &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Breaking the Ice&quot;. The crew aboard the spaceship answer questions received from school children who are said to be from Kenmare.
