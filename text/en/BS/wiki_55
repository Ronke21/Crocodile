<text>Pforzheim () is a city of over 125,000 inhabitants in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg, in the southwest of Germany.

It is known for its jewelry and watch-making industry, and as such has gained the nickname &quot;Goldstadt&quot; (&quot;Golden City&quot;). With an area of , it is situated about halfway between the cities of Stuttgart and Karlsruhe at the confluence of three rivers (Enz, Nagold and Würm). It marks the frontier between Baden and Württemberg, being located on Baden territory. From 1535 to 1565, it was the home to the Margraves of Baden-Durlach.

The City of Pforzheim is a &quot;Stadtkreis&quot;, meaning it is both a municipality and a district at the same time. Also, it hosts the administrative offices of the Enz district that surrounds the city.

During World War II, Pforzheim was bombed by the Allies a number of times. The largest raid, and one of the most devastating area bombardments of World War II, was carried out by the Royal Air Force (RAF) on the evening of 23 February 1945. Nearly one third of the town&#x27;s population, 17,600 people, were killed in the air raid, and about 83% of the town&#x27;s buildings were destroyed. The Allies believed that precision instruments were being produced here for use in the German war effort and that the town was a transport centre for the movement of German troops.

From 1945 to 1948, Pforzheim (after the initial French occupation) was administered by the United States military and was part of the short-lived state of Württemberg-Baden. In the 20 years following the end of the war, Pforzheim was gradually rebuilt. The town reflects the architecture of the postwar period and has some landmark buildings of the 1950s.

==Geography==

Pforzheim is located at the northern rim of the eastern part of the Black Forest (Schwarzwald) and the rim of the hilly country of the Kraichgau, in an open valley at the confluences of the rivers Würm and Nagold, as well as the rivers Nagold and Enz. Due to its location, this city is also called the &quot;three-valleys town&quot; (&quot;Drei-Täler Stadt&quot;) or the &quot;Gateway to the Black Forest&quot; (&quot;Pforte zum Schwarzwald / Porta Hercynia&quot;).

Pforzheim and its surrounding area belongs to the &quot;Densely Populated Area Karlsruhe/Pforzheim&quot;. Pforzheim has the functions of a regional center (Mittelzentrum) for the towns and municipalities Birkenfeld (Enz), Eisingen, Engelsbrand, Friolzheim, Heimsheim, Ispringen, Kämpfelbach, Keltern, Kieselbronn, Königsbach-Stein, Mönsheim, Neuenbürg, Neuhausen, Neulingen, Niefern-Öschelbronn, Ölbronn-Dürrn, Remchingen, Straubenhardt, Tiefenbronn, Wiernsheim, Wimsheim and Wurmberg.

==History==
It was settled by the Romans earlier than the current centers of Stuttgart and Karlsruhe were. These colonists constructed a ford through the river, shortly past the confluence of the three rivers, for their military highway. Due to this strategic location, Pforzheim later became a center for the timber-rafting trade, which transported timber from the Black Forest via the rivers Wuerm, Nagold, Enz and down the Neckar and Rhine to, among other markets, the Netherlands for use in shipbuilding. Their timbers were also used to construct the foundations for Amsterdam, which was built in a swamp.

Since 90: A settlement was established by Roman citizens at the Enz River near the modern &quot;Altstädter Brücke&quot; (old town bridge). Archeological surveys have unearthed several artifacts of that period which are kept and displayed in the Kappelhof Museum. The settlement was located where the Roman military road connecting the military camp Argentoratum (nowadays Strasbourg in France) and the military camp at Cannstatt (now a suburb of Stuttgart) at the Upper Germanic Limes border line of the Roman Empire crossed the Enz river.

This place was known as &quot;Portus&quot; (meaning &quot;river crossing, harbor&quot;), which is believed to be the origin of the first part of the city&#x27;s name &quot;Pforzheim&quot;. A Roman milestone (the so-called &#x27;Leugenstein&#x27;) from the year 245 was excavated in modern times at present-day Friolzheim; it is marked with the exact distance to &#x27;Portus&#x27; and is the first documented evidence of the settlement.

259/260: The Roman settlement &#x27;Portus&#x27; was destroyed completely, as the Frank and Alemanni tribes overran the Upper Germanic Limes border line of the Roman Empire and conquered the Roman administered area west of the Rhine River. From then on, over an extended period of time, historical records about the settlement were not available.

6th/7th century: Graves from this period indicate that the settlement had been continued.

1067: The settlement was mentioned as &quot;Phorzheim&quot; for the first time, in a document by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. Visits to Pforzheim by Heinrich IV in 1067 and 1074 are documented.

Before 1080: The &quot;old town&quot; of Pforzheim was awarded market rights (&quot;Marktrecht&quot;). At that time Pforzheim belonged to the estate of Hirsau Monastery, according to monastery documents.

From 1150: Establishment of the &quot;new town&quot; west of the &quot;old town&quot; at the foot of the Schlossberg (palais hill) under Margrave Hermann V.

1200: The town charter of the &quot;new town&quot; was mentioned for the first time in a document. The &quot;old town&quot; continued to exist as a legally independent entity.

1220: The Margraves of Baden selected Pforzheim as their residence. This resulted in the &quot;new town&quot; becoming prominent.

1240: A mayor of Pforzheim was mentioned in a document for the first time.

13th/14th century: Pforzheim enjoyed its first period of flourishing. A group of influential patricians emerged. They developed the financial markets of those days. The town drew its income from the wood trade, timber rafting, the tannery trade, textile manufacturing, and other crafts. Documents mention &quot;mayor, judge, council and citizens&quot;.

The town walls surrounding the new town were completed about 1290. During this era, three Roman Catholic orders established their convents in town (the Franciscan order established their domicile within the town wall at present-day &quot;Barfuesserkirche&quot; (the choir of which remains), the Dominican sisters order established their domicile outside the walls of the old town near Auer Bridge, and the Prediger cloister was located east of the Schlossberg, probably inside the town walls). Outside the town wall and across the Enz river, the suburb &quot;Flösser Quarters&quot; (the home of the timber-floating trade) was established. Next to the western town wall, the suburb of &quot;Brötzingen&quot; gradually developed.

The Margraves of Baden considered Pforzheim as their most important power base up to the first half of the 14th century. Under Margrave Bernard I (Bernhard I), Pforzheim became one of the administrative centers of the margraviate.

1322: Holy Ghost Hospital was founded at Tränk Street (present-day Deimling Street).

===15th century===
Various fraternities, also known as guilds, among people working in the same trade were established: The fraternity of tailors in 1410, the fraternity of bakers on 14 May 1422, the fraternity of the weavers in 1469, the fraternity of the wine-growers in 1491, the fraternity of the skippers and timber raftsmen in 1501, and the fraternity of the carters in 1512. Members of the same fraternity assisted each other in various ways, for example with funerals and in cases of sickness. In a sense, the fraternities were early forms of health and life insurance.

8–9 August 1418: Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor visits Margrave Bernard I (Bernhard I) in Pforzheim. On this occasion the mint of the Margraves of Baden in Pforzheim was mentioned. Mint master was Jakob Broeglin between 1414 and 1431. The emperor appointed the master of the Pforzheim mint, Jakob Bröglin, and Bois von der Winterbach for five years as Royal Mint Masters of the mints of Frankfurt and Nördlingen. The Margrave was appointed as their patron.

1447: The wedding of Margrave Charles I (Karl I) of Baden with Katharina of Austria, the sister of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor (Friedrich III), was celebrated in Pforzheim with great pomp (including tournaments and dances).
1455: Johannes Reuchlin, the great German humanist, was born in Pforzheim on 29 January (he died in Stuttgart on 30 June 1522). He attended the Latin School section of the monastery school run by the Dominican order of Pforzheim in the late 1460s. Later, partly due to Reuchlin&#x27;s efforts, the Latin School of Pforzheim developed into one of the most prominent schools in southwestern Germany, named &quot;Reuchlin-Gymnasium&quot;. The school&#x27;s teachers and pupils played an outstanding role in the dissemination of the ideas of humanism and the protestant reformation movement. The most famous pupils included Reuchlin himself, Reuchlin&#x27;s nephew Philipp Melanchthon, and Simon Grynaeus.

1460: Margrave Charles I established a kind of monastery (Kollegialstift) at the site of Schlosskirche St. Michael, turning the church into a collegiate church. There were also plans to establish a university in Pforzheim, but this plan had to be abandoned because Margrave Charles I lost the Battle of Seckenheim.

1463: Margrave Charles I was forced to transfer the palace and the town of Pforzheim as a fiefdom to the Elector Palatine after losing the Battle of Seckenheim. He then began to build a new palace in modern Baden-Baden. Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden finally moved the residence of the margraves to Baden-Baden. This gradually ended the first period of Pforzheim&#x27;s flourishment. The rich merchants gradually left the town, which declined to the status of a country town of mostly small traders.

1486: The &quot;Weavers Ordinance&quot; (&quot;Wollweberordnung&quot;) for the towns Pforzheim und Ettlingen was approved by Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden. This was a contract concerning the town privileges of Pforzheim. This regulation of the weaving trade did not allow the formation of a regular guild (Zunft).

1491: A contract between Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden and the citizens of Pforzheim was concluded, granting the town of Pforzheim several privileges concerning taxes and business.

1496: Foundation of the first printer&#x27;s shop by Thomas Anshelm. During the first half of the 16th century Pforzheim&#x27;s printers contributed significantly to the establishment of this (in those days) new medium.

===16th century===
1501: Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden enacted the &quot;Ordinance on the timber rafting profession in Pforzheim&quot;. The single timber logs that were floated from the deeper Black Forest areas down the Enz, Nagold and Wuerm rivers were bound together in the Au area to form larger timber rafts. Those rafts were then floated down the lower Enz, Neckar and Rhine rivers. The timber rafting stations of Weissenstein, Dillstein and Pforzheim were well known in the profession.

1501 was also the year for which an outbreak of the plague (probably the bubonic plague) is recorded in the Swabian chronicle &quot;Annalium Suevicorum&quot; by Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen professor Martin Grusius, published 1596. It is not known how many of Pforzheim&#x27;s citizens died in that year, but there are reports of 500 deceased in the close by city of Calw and about 4000 in Stuttgart, which accounted for approximately one quarter to one half of the populations of those towns. Outbreaks of the disease were reported for many places in southwestern Germany, Bohemia, the Alsace region in nowadays France, Switzerland, and Italy. Common graves with massive numbers of human bones at the cemetery of St. Michael Church and the cemetery on the estate of the Dominican order near nowadays Waisenhausplatz found during the last century may indicate that hundreds of citizens became the victims of the plague. There are indications that a fraternity for taking care of the sick and removing the bodies of the deceased from houses was formed in 1501, whose members later on stayed together and became known as the choral society &quot;Singergesellschaft&quot;, which is still active today as the &quot;Loebliche Singergesellschaft of 1501&quot;. (They are probably one of the oldest clubs in Europe).

1520s: The ideas of the protestant religious movement advanced by Martin Luther spread rapidly in Pforzheim. Its most prominent promoters were Johannes Schwebel, a preacher at Holy Ghost church (Heiliggeistkirche), and Johannes Unger, the principal of the Dominican Latin school.

1535–1565: Due to the heritage division of the clan of the Margraves of Baden, Margrave Ernst of Baden made Pforzheim the residential town of his family line. He decided to use the Schlosskirche St. Michael as the entombment site for his family line.

1549: A large fire caused severe damage to the town.

1556: After the conclusion of the Peace of Augsburg in 1555, Margrave Karl II introduced &quot;Lutheranism&quot; (Protestantism) as the state religion in the district Baden-Durlach, which included Pforzheim. The (Catholic) monasteries were gradually shut down.

1565: Margrave Karl II chose Durlach as the new residential town. Pforzheim stayed one of the administrative centers of Baden.

===17th century===
1618: At the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the number of inhabitants of Pforzheim is estimated to have been between 2500 and 3000. This was the largest town among all towns in Baden, even though at that time it had already declined somewhat.
1645: Toward the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War the &quot;old town&quot; was burned down by Bavarian (i.e. Catholic) troops. It was rebuilt, but without the former fortifications, which gave it the status of a village-like settlement. It soon vanished from historical records. The &quot;new town&quot; had survived.

1688–1697: The &quot;War of the Palatinian Succession&quot; (also called the Nine Years War) caused tremendous destruction in Southwestern Germany. The French &quot;sun king&quot; Louis XIV&#x27;s efforts to expand the territory of France up to the Upper Rhine river and to put the Elector Palatine under pressure to severe its ties with the League of Augsburg included the &quot;Brûlez le Palatinat!&quot; tactics of destroying major towns on both sides of the Rhine river. These tactics seem to have been mainly the idea of the French war minister, François Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois.

Pforzheim was occupied by French troops on 10 October 1688. Commanding officer is said to have been Joseph de Montclar. The town was forced to accommodate a large number of soldiers and had to pay a large amount of &quot;contributions&quot; to the French. When the army unit was about to depart early in the morning of 21 January 1689 (obviously because an army of the Holy Roman Empire had been approaching), they set many major buildings on fire, including the palais, the city hall, and vicarages. About 70 houses (i.e. one quarter of all houses) and part of the town&#x27;s fortifications were reportedly destroyed.

Between 2 and 4 August, the French army under the general command of Marshal Jacques Henri de Durfort de Duras again crossed the Rhine river and began the destruction of major towns in Baden. On 10 August 1689, a French army unit under the command of General Ezéchiel du Mas, Comte de Mélac appeared in front of Pforzheims town gates, but this time the town refused to surrender. In response, the French army began shelling the town with cannons from the Rod hill located southwest of the town, and the several hundred soldiers of the German imperial command, who were defending the town, were forced to surrender. After a short period of looting, the French troops set the inner town area on fire on 15 August, which made that area uninhabitable for several weeks. Then the French moved on.

During the following two years, French troops stayed away from Pforzheim, but the economic situation of the town was miserable. In addition to this, the reconstruction of the town and the repairs of the fortifications under the supervision of Johann Matthaeus Faulhaber, the chief construction officer of the Margraviate Baden, required a lot of efforts. The accommodation of an imperial garrison under the command of (then) colonel Count Palffy also was a heavy burden.

In 1691, Louvois instructed his marshals to destroy those towns which were to serve as winter quarters for imperial troops, explicitly including Pforzheim, and then continue to Wuerttemberg for further destructions. After the French troops had crossed the Rhine river under the command of Marshal Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges at Philippsburg on 3 August 1691, they assaulted the Margraves&#x27; residential town of Durlach and 1,200 cavalry men, 300 dragoons and 1,200 infantry men advanced toward Pforzheim where they arrived in the morning on 9 August and surrounded the town. When the approximately 200 imperial soldiers under the command of Captain Zickwolf and other men in the town refused to surrender, the siege began. After shelling the town during the day and the following night, the resistance of the town broke down and on 10 August in the morning the French forced the town gates open, occupied and looted it (although with little success, as there was not much left to be taken away). On 12 August, the French moved on, this time refraining from setting houses on fire. The fortification had again been damaged, though (the White Tower, the Auer Bridge Gate, the Upper Mill and the Nonnen Mill were burnt down). The French also stole all church bells, except for one minor one.

On 20 September 1692, again crossed the Rhine river under the general command of Marshal Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges, and advanced toward Durlach and Pforzheim. On 24 September, 2,000 cavalry soldiers and 1,200 infantry and artillery troops under the command of Marshal Noël Bouton de Chamilly, moved to Pforzheim, where the town and 600 soldiers of the imperial German army in town surrendered without any military engagements. The rest of the French army arrived on 27 September under the command of Marshal de Lorges. On the same day, the French army moved on to Oetisheim near Mühlacker and attacked an imperial army unit of 4,000 cavalry men under the command of Duke Frederick Charles of Württemberg-Winnental in their camp. As they were taken by surprise, they withdrew hastily and lost several hundred men, either killed or captured by the French. (The Duke himself was among the French prisoners.) On 28 September, the French army returned to Pforzheim and established a camp. It was reported that the entire Enz valley between the village of Eutingen east of Pforzheim and the village of Birkenfeld west of Pforzheim was occupied by the 30,000 French soldiers&#x27; camps. From their base in Pforzheim, French army units obviously under the leadership of Marshal de Chamilly advanced along the river valleys of Nagold and Würm and looted and destroyed the villages and towns of Huchenfeld, Calw, Hirsau, Liebenzell and Zavelstein. They also destroyed Liebeneck castle about 10 kilometres from Pforzheim towering above the Würm valley, where part of the Pforzheim town archives were hidden. The archive was burned. Another part of the town archive as well as documents of Baden administrative office had been brought to Calw, where they went up in flames, too.

When the French troops left after about one week of occupation, they again looted Pforzheim and put it on fire. This time, all houses which had survived the two previous fires, were destroyed. In the Au suburb, only three houses survived. The Au bridge was heavily damaged. Only four houses survived in the Broetzingen suburb. The town church of St. Stephen and a large part of the Dominican monastery complex were also destroyed. The Castle Church (Schlosskirche) of St. Michael was heavily damaged, and the family tombs of the Margraves of Baden in the church were desecrated by the soldiers. The last remaining church bell and the churches&#x27; clockworks were stolen as well. The town wall was damaged again, including the town gates. After the week-long presence of 30,000 soldiers in a town of only a few thousand citizens, all food was gone, including the seeds saved for next spring&#x27;s sowing season. Every tree and grapevine on the valley slopes had been used up as firewood. The French army reached their camp in Philippsburg on 5 October 1692.

===18th century===
1718: Inauguration of the &quot;institution for orphans, the mad, the sick, for discipline and work&quot; in a building of the former Dominican order Convent by the Enz river. Fifty years later this institution was to become the incubator of Pforzheim&#x27;s jewellery and watchmaking industries.

1715–1730: During this period, there was a prolonged dispute between Pforzheim&#x27;s citizens and the Margrave of Baden concerning the privileges granted to the town in 1491, which the Margrave considered obsolete and therefore demanded significantly higher tax payments from Pforzheim citizens. The issue was taken all the way to the Imperial Court of Justice, where the town&#x27;s motion was defeated.

1767: Establishment of a watch and jewellery factory in the orphanage. This led to Pforzheim&#x27;s jewellery industries. Watchmaking was given up later on.

===19th century===
1805–06: A typhus epidemic in Pforzheim caused many deaths, disrupting the town&#x27;s economy.

1809: The Administrative District Pforzheim of Baden was split into a &quot;Municipal District Administration Pforzheim&quot; and two Rural Districts.

1813: The two Rural Districts were combined to form the &quot;Rural District Administration Pforzheim&quot;.

1819: &quot;Municipal District Pforzheim&quot; and &quot;Rural District Pforzheim&quot; are merged to form the &quot;Higher District Administration Pforzheim&quot;.

1836: Ferdinand Öchsle in Pforzheim invented a device for measuring the sugar content in freshly pressed grape juice for assessing the future quality of wine (&quot;Mostwaage&quot;). It is still in use in the winery business.

1861–62: Pforzheim was connected to the German railway network with the completion of a section of the Karlsruhe–Mühlacker line between Wilferdingen and Pforzheim.

1863: The railway section between Pforzheim and Mühlacker was completed, thus establishing railway traffic between the capital of Baden, Karlsruhe, and the capital of Württemberg, Stuttgart.

1864: The &quot;Higher District Administration Pforzheim&quot; was made the &quot;Regional Administration Pforzheim&quot;.

1868: The Enz Valley Railway between Pforzheim and Wildbad was completed.

1877: Inauguration of the Arts and Crafts School (Kunstgewerbeschule; now incorporated into Hochschule (University) Pforzheim).

1888: Bertha Benz and her two sons arrived in Pforzheim on the first &quot;long-distance&quot; drive in the history of the automobile in a car manufactured by her husband Carl Benz in order to visit relatives. She had started her drive in Mannheim, which is located about from Pforzheim. The very first gasoline-powered automobile with an internal combustion engine of the inventor had hit the roads only two years earlier after a patent for this new technology had been granted to Karl Benz on 29 January 1886. She bought the gasoline necessary for her trip back home in a &quot;pharmacy&quot; in Pforzheim. During the trip, Bertha Benz had to make repairs with a hairpin to open a blocked fuel line, and after returning home, suggested to her husband that another gear be provided in his automobile for climbing hills. To commemorate this first long-distance journey by automobile, the Bertha Benz Memorial Route was officially approved as a route of industrial heritage of mankind in 2008. Now everybody can follow the of signposted route from Mannheim via Heidelberg to Pforzheim and back.

1893: Inauguration of the Pforzheim Synagogue.

The company Wellendorff, a family-owned jewellery producing until now, is founded by Ernst Alexander Wellendorff. The enterprise sells many kinds of jewelry at the highest level worldwide.

===20th century===
From 1900: Revival of the Pforzheim watchmaking industry.

1905: The western borough Brötzingen was incorporated into the administration Pforzheim.

1906: The 1. FC Pforzheim football club was defeated by VfB Leipzig with a score of 1–2 in the final game of the German football championship.

1907: Julius Epple founded Aristo, the watch brand, benefitting from the bull market for wristwatches in the 1920s.

1914–1918: Pforzheim was not a battlefield in World War I, but 1600 men from Pforzheim lost their lives as soldiers on the battlefields.

1920s: The Pforzheim watchmaking industry thrived due to the new popularity of wrist-watches.

1927: Stowa, another well-known German watch brand from Pforzheim, was founded by Walter Storz in Hornberg, moving the business to Pforzheim in 1935. Walter&#x27;s son, Werner, eventually takes over the business.

From 1933: Along with the installation of the Nazi government in Germany the local subsidiaries of all political parties, groups and organizations other than the NSDAP were gradually disbanded in town. Public life as well as individual affairs were increasingly affected by Nazi influences. Persecution of Jewish fellow citizens occurred in Pforzheim, too, with boycotts of Jewish shops and companies.

1938: Establishment of the municipal Jewellery Museum.

1938: On 9 November, the so-called Kristallnacht, the Pforzheim Synagogue (see WWW-site) of the Jewish community was so badly damaged by Nazi activists that it had to be demolished later on.

1939: &quot;Regional Administration Pforzheim&quot; (Bezirksamt) was converted to the &quot;Rural District Pforzheim&quot; (Landkreis) with Pforzheim city as its administrative site. However, the town itself became a district-less administrative body.

1940: Deportation of Jewish citizens of Pforzheim to the concentration camp in Gurs (France). Only 55 of the 195 deported persons escaped from the holocaust.

====World War II====

In 1944, many factories were converted to produce weaponry such as anti-aircraft shells, fuses for bombs, and allegedly even parts for the V-1 and V-2 rockets.

On the evening of 23 February 1945, Pforzheim was bombed in one of the most devastating area bombardments of World War II. Carried out by the Royal Air Force, the air raid killed about one quarter of the town&#x27;s population, over 17,000 people, and destroyed about 83% of the town&#x27;s buildings. The mission order to bomb Pforzheim issued by RAF Bomber Command states as the intention of the raid on Pforzheim &quot;to destroy built up area and associated industries and rail facilities&quot;. The bombardment was carried out as part of the British carpet bombing campaign. The town was put on the target list for bombardments in November 1944 because it was thought by the Allies to be producing precision instruments for use in the German war effort and as transport centre for the movement of German troops.

There were also several minor raids in 1944 and 1945.

After the main attack, about 30,000 people had to be fed by makeshift public kitchens because their housing had been destroyed. Almost 90% of the buildings in the core city area had been destroyed. Many Pforzheim citizens were buried in mass graves at Pforzheim&#x27;s main cemetery because they could not be identified. There are also many graves of complete families. Among the dead were several hundred foreigners who had been in Pforzheim as forced labor workers.

The inner-city districts were severely depopulated. According to the State Statistics Bureau (&quot;Statistisches Landesamt&quot;), in the Market Square area (&quot;Marktplatzviertel&quot;) in 1939 there were 4,112 registered inhabitants, in 1945 none (0). In the Old Town area (&quot;Altstadtviertel&quot;) in 1939 there were 5,109 inhabitants, in 1945 only three persons were still living there. In the Leopold Square area, in 1939 there were 4,416 inhabitants, in 1945 only 13.

The German Army Report of 24 February 1945 devoted only two lines to reporting the bombardment: &quot;In the early evening hours of February 23, a forceful British attack was directed at Pforzheim.&quot; RAF Bomber Command later assessed the bombing raid as the one with &quot;probably the greatest proportion (of destroyed built-up area) (of any target) in one raid during the war&quot;.

In early April, as the Allied forces and the French Army advanced toward Pforzheim, the local German military commander gave orders to destroy the electric power generating plant and those gas and water supply lines that were still working, but local residents succeeded in persuading the staff sergeant in charge of the operation to refrain from this action in the face of the imminent and seemingly inevitable surrender of the German military. Likewise, orders were issued for the destruction of those bridges that had remained unscathed (some of the bridges had been destroyed by the air strikes of 23 February, others damaged or destroyed earlier in the war). Only the Iron (Railway) Bridge in Weißenstein ward was saved by citizens who pulled off the fuse wiring from the explosive devices which had already been installed, and dropped it into Nagold river. On 8 April, French troops, including an armored vehicle unit, moved into Pforzheim from the northwest, and were able to occupy the area north of Enz river, but the area south of the Enz river was defended by a German infantry unit using artillery. Fighting was especially fierce in Broetzingen. The French army units (including an Algerian and Moroccan unit) suffered heavy losses; among the dead was the commander of the army unit, Capitaine Dorance. The advance of the French army came to a halt temporarily, but with the support of fighter-bomber aircraft and due to the bad condition of the defenders - which included many old men and young boys who had been drafted into the Volkssturm - the French troops took possession of the vast rubble field which once was the a residential town of the Baden Margraves on 18 April.

The three months of French occupation were reportedly marked by hostile attitudes on both the French army side and the Pforzheim population&#x27;s side; incidents of rape and looting, mainly by Moroccan soldiers, were also reported. Au Bridge (&quot;Auerbruecke&quot;) and Wuerm Bridge received makeshift repairs by the French military. The US Army, which replaced the French troops on 8 July 1945, helped repair Goethe Bridge, Benckiser Bridge, Old Town Bridge (&quot;Altstädterbrücke&quot;) and Horse Bridge (&quot;Roßbrücke&quot;) in 1945 and the following year. The relationship between the population and the US military was reportedly more relaxed than had been the case with the French army.

====Post-World War II====
1945–1965: Pforzheim was gradually rebuilt, giving Pforzheim a quite modern look. In September 1951 the Northern Town Bridge (Nordstadtbrücke) was inaugurated (the ceremony was attended by then Federal President Prof. Dr. Theodor Heuss). Jahn Bridge followed in December 1951, Werder Bridge in May 1952, the rebuilt Goethe Bridge in October 1952, and the rebuilt Old Town Bridge was inaugurated in 1954.

1955: On the occasion of the 500th birthday anniversary of Johannes Reuchlin, the city of Pforzheim established the Reuchlin Prize and awarded it for the first time in the presence of then President of the Federal Republic of Germany (West-Germany), Prof. Dr. Theodor Heuss.

1961: Inauguration of the culture center &quot;Reuchlinhaus&quot;, which from then on housed the Jewellery Museum, the Arts and Crafts Association, the City Library, the Homeland Museum (Heimatmuseum), and the City Archives.

1968: On 10 July shortly before 22:00, Pforzheim and its surrounding areas were hit by a rare tornado. It was rated F4 on the Fujita scale. Two persons died under a collapsing wall in nearby Ottenhausen and more than 200 were injured, and 1750 buildings were damaged. Across the town between Buechenbronn ward and the village of Wurmberg the storm caused severe damage to forest areas (i.e. most trees fell to the ground). During the first night and the following days the soldiers of the French 3rd Husar Regiment and the US Army Unit, which were still stationed at the Buckenberg Barracks, helped clear the streets of a lot of fallen trees (especially in the Buckenberg/Haidach area). It took about four weeks to carry out the most necessary repairs on buildings. The overhead electric contact wires for the electric trolley buses then still operating in town and the streetcar transport system to the village of Ittersbach were never repaired; those transport systems were retired.

1971–1975: The townships of Würm, Hohenwart, Buechenbronn, Huchenfeld and Eutingen were incorporated into the city administration.

1973: Inauguration of the new Pforzheim City Hall.

1973 As part of the reform of administrative districts, the rural district of Pforzheim was incorporated into the newly established Enz rural district, which has its administration in Pforzheim. But the city of Pforzheim itself remains a district-less city. In addition, Pforzheim became the administrative center of the newly formed Northern Black Forest Region.

1975 On 1 January, the population exceeded 100.000 and Pforzheim gained the status of a &quot;large city&quot; (Grossstadt).

1979: Inauguration of the Pforzheim City Museum.

1983: Inauguration of the &quot;Technical Museum of the Jewellery and Watchmaking Industry&quot; and the &quot;Citizens Museum&quot;.

1987: Inauguration of the City Convention Center.

1987/1990: Inauguration of the City Theater at the Waisenhausplatz.

1989: Sister City agreement with the City of Gernika, Spain.

1990: Sister City agreement with the City of Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France.

1991: Sister City agreement with the City of Vicenza, Italy.

1992: State Gardening Expo in Pforzheim. Enzauenpark was created and part of the Enz river was re-naturalized.

1994: Inauguration of the cultural institution &quot;Kulturhaus Osterfeld&quot;.

1994: Merger of the Pforzheim Business School and the Pforzheim School of Design to form the Pforzheim University of Applied Sciences in Design, Technology and Business.

1995: Inauguration of the Archeological Site Kappelhof.

===21st century===
2000: Inauguration of the Pforzheim Gallery.

2002: In November, during excavation works for a new shopping center in the center of the city, a power shovel hit a bomb that had not detonated during the bombardment of 1945. On a Sunday, about 5000 citizens temporarily left their homes as a precaution while specialists defused and disposed of the latest of a large number of unexploded bombs found in Pforzheim&#x27;s grounds since 1945.

2006: The Timex Group introduced a line of high-end watches engineered in Pforzheim over a five-year period, to six sigma standards. The technology used miniaturization with digital sensors and microprocessors driving independent motors and dial hands — to enable a range of specialized complications atypical to non-digital, analog watches — an array of functions that would either be impossible or highly impractical in a mechanical movement.

==Demographics==
===Administrative unions===
Formerly independent communities and districts which were incorporated into the City of Pforzheim.

===Population===
The table below shows the number of inhabitants for the past 500 years. Until 1789 the numbers represent estimates, after that they represent census results or official recordings by the Statistics Offices or the city administration.

The population growth diagram show that the largest growth rates were recorded between about 1830 and 1925, which was the period following the political reorganisation of Europe agreed upon at the Vienna Congress of 1815 after the violent period that was so much dominated by Napoleon Bonaparte of France. This high population growth period coincided with the period of intensive industrialisation of Germany. Population growth weakened due to the effects of World War I and World War II. The population declined sharply due to the destruction on 23 February 1945, and increased sharply in the post-World War II era due to high economic growth levels in West-Germany and the rapid rebuilding efforts in Pforzheim. Earlier setbacks were recorded during the Thirty Years&#x27; War period in the 17th century.

===Immigration===
The table below lists the largest immigrant groups of Pforzheim .
===Religions===
After margrave Karl II of Baden in 1556 installed the Protestant Reformation in the Margraviate of Baden, of which Pforzheim was the capital in those days, Pforzheim continued to be a Protestant town for several centuries. The congregations in Pforzheim were affiliated with the deanery (Dekanat) of Pforzheim of the Protestant National Church of Baden, unless they were members of one of the independent churches (Freikirche).

Since the 19th century at the latest Catholics settled in Pforzheim again. They are affiliated with the deanery of Pforzheim, which belongs to the Archdiocese of Freiburg.

Other denominations and religious sects in Pforzheim are:
* Israelite Congregation
* Islamic Congregation
* Adventist Congregation
* Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses
* Baptist Church
* Salvation Army
* Methodist Church
* Church of Christ, Scientist

==Politics==
===City council===
The city council of Pforzheim consists of the &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; (mayor) as its president and 40 elected (part-time) councillors. It is democratically elected by the citizens for a period of five years. The last election was on 26 May 2019. The city council is the main representative body of the city and determines the goals and frameworks for all local political activities. It makes decisions about all important issues regarding the public life and administration of the city and directs and monitors the work of the city administration. It forms expert committees in order to deal with specialized issues.

===Lord mayors===
At an early stage, the town administration was led by the mayor (&quot;Schultheiss&quot;) who used to be appointed by the lord (owner) of the town. Later on, there was a council with a mayor leading it, who since 1849 holds the title &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;. The terms of office of the mayors until 1750 are unknown. Only the names of the mayors are mentioned in historical documents.
===The coat of arms===

The coat of arms of Pforzheim city shows in the left-hand half of a shield an inclined bar in red color on a golden background, and the right-hand half is divided into four fields in the colors red, silver, blue and gold. The city flag is white-blue.

The inclined bar can be traced back to the 13th century as the symbol of the lords (owners) of Pforzheim, which later on also became the National Coat of Arms of Baden, but its meaning is unknown. Since 1489 the coat of arms in its entire form can be verified, but its meaning is not known, either. Current coloring has been used only since 1853; in earlier times the coloring was different.

==Economy and infrastructure==
Pforzheim is one of the regional centers (Oberzentrum) in Baden-Württemberg and has one of the highest densities of industrial activity in the state.

Pforzheim is historically an important jewelry and watch-making centre in Germany. Due to this reason, Pforzheim is nicknamed as Golden City. Jewelry and watch-making industry is first set up by Jean François Autran after receiving an edict from then overlord Margrave Karl Friedrich von Baden. This enterprise is later joined by other commercial enterprises and helped Pforzheim to become an important manufacturing city. Pforzheim accounts for just under 70 percent of the total sales of the German jewelry and silverware industry and around 80 percent of all the pieces of jewelry exported by Germany come from Pforzheim.

However, a smaller fraction of the economy nowadays is dedicated to producing the traditional products of watches and jewellery. Only 11,000 people are employed in the jewelry and watch-making industries. Two thirds of all employment positions are made available in the areas of metal processing, dental industry electronics and electro-technology. The mail order companies (Bader, Klingel, Wenz) with their sales volumes in the order of millions of Euros occupies a leading position in Germany. Tourism is gaining importance. In this respect the city benefits from its favorable Three-Valleys location at the gateway to the Black Forest, and related to this, from the starting points of a large number of hiking, cycling and waterway routes. The European long-distance trail E1 passes through Pforzheim. It is also the starting point of the Black Forest Hiking Routes Westweg, Mittelweg and Ostweg.

===Transport===
Pforzheim is located on the Karlsruhe–Mühlacker line, part of the legacy railway between Karlsruhe and Stuttgart. Pforzheim Hauptbahnhof, the central station, is a junction station, as two Black Forest branch lines start here: the Enz Valley Railway to Bad Wildbad, and the Nagold Valley Railway to Calw, Nagold and Horb. Since the 1990s, the Karlsruhe tram-train system has been extended to Pforzheim: since 2019, the local service to Karlsruhe is the S5 tram-train continuing into Karlsruhe city centre and Wörth am Rhein. In addition, tram-train S6 links Pforzheim via the Enz Valley Railway with the town centre of Bad Wildbad. In addition to tram-trains, regional trains operated by Go-Ahead Baden-Württemberg, SWEG Bahn Stuttgart and DB Regio Baden-Württemberg offer connections to Karlsruhe, Mühlacker, Bietigheim-Bissingen and Stuttgart (routes IRE1 and MEX17a), as well as to Tübingen via Calw (RB73). Also, some Intercity trains operated by Deutsche Bahn serve Pforzheim on its Karlsruhe-Stuttgart-Nuremberg route.

Local bus service in Pforzheim is currently franchised to DB Südwestbus, operating 13 urban bus routes. In addition, there are regional bus services to surrounding places.

All regional trains, tram-trains and buses within Pforzheim and the surrounding Enzkreis are marketed under the brand of the &quot;Verkehrsverbund Pforzheim-Enzkreis&quot; (VPE), offering mutually integrated fares.

Between 1900 and 1968 a metre-gauge light railway existed between Pforzheim and Ittersbach, connected there to the still existing Busenbach–Ittersbach railway.

The A8 Autobahn (Perl–Bad Reichenhall) runs by just to the north of the city. The city can be accessed via four A8 exits. In addition, the B10 (Lebach–Augsburg) and B294 (Gundelfingen–Bretten) and B463 (Pforzheim–Nagold) run through the city.

<doc id="549163" wikidata="Q2164093" url="?curid=549163" title="Wave Race">
<text>Wave Race is a 1992 racing video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy. It is the first game in the &quot;Wave Race&quot; series. The player controls a jet skier competing against AI opponents or up to three friends (using the GameBoy multiplayer link cable accessory) in two different racing modes across sixteen tracks.

==Gameplay==

The game contains two gameplay modes. In &quot;Slalom&quot;, the goal is to take posts by racing through pairs of posts across the track. Each post a racer passes through increases their score by one point. The racer with the most points once all posts have been taken wins. In &quot;Race&quot;, players must proceed through certain checkpoints and complete each lap in a set time limit. Two on track powerups are available. The dolphin powerup gives the player increased turning ability, while the octopus powerup allows the recipient to steal from opponents.

There are eight tracks for each mode (a combined total of sixteen tracks). In both modes, racers have to navigate a variety of on track obstacles (buoys, pylons, shallow water, whirlpools) and jumps. Players begin at a slower class of watercraft and graduate to faster engines. Players can also use a limited turbo boost. The game features four-player multiplayer.

== Development and release ==
== Reception ==
&quot;Wave Race&quot; on the Game Boy garnered average reception from critics. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s George Sinfield and Rob Noel wrote that the game successfully emulated the feel of watercraft racing. They praised the effect of skidding around corners, and recommended the four-player multiplayer experience. A writer for German magazine &quot;Mega Fun&quot; commended the game&#x27;s audiovisual presentation, playability and multiplayer mode. &quot;Joystick&quot;″s Olivier Karali gave the game favorable remarks for its &quot;exemplary&quot; playability, particularly the controls. &quot;N-Force&quot;″s Nick Roberts and Carl Rowley considered it a mediocre and frustrating racing game. While they found the visuals to be well detailed and the soundtrack average, they felt its gameplay lacked depth. 

&quot;Consolemania&quot;″s Alessandro Rossetto praised the game&#x27;s realistic controls, sound, and playability, but criticized the graphics for their lack of variety. Selby Bateman of &quot;Game Players Nintendo Guide&quot; noted the solid feel the personal watercrafts have when turning in the water. Bateman also commended the game&#x27;s graphical department, multiplayer mode, and auto-save feature. &quot;Video Games&quot;″ Michael Paul highlighted the game&#x27;s controls and difficulty level, stating that &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for a multi-player game that&#x27;s also fun to play solo, &quot;Wave Race&quot; is the right wave for you&quot;. &quot;Total!&quot;″s Thomas Hellwig and Sandra Alter found it to be a thrilling title, citing its intelligent opponents and tracks, but saw the poor collision detection and constant flickering as shortcomings. 

&quot;Hobby Consolas&quot; criticized &quot;Wave Race&quot; on the Game Boy for its weak visuals and poor playability. &quot;Nintendo Acción&quot;″s Juan Carlos García faulted the game&#x27;s mediocre graphics, repetitive tracks, and viewing perspective. &quot;Power Unlimited&quot; recommended the game for &quot;speed enthusiasts who love the Game Boy&quot;. &quot;Joypad&quot;″s Kendy Ty panned its slow scrolling, and labelled it as a &quot;poor man&#x27;s &quot;Micro Machines&quot;&quot;. &quot;Player One&quot;″s Stéphane Pilet lauded its audiovisual department, playability, and multiplayer. Writing for &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, Clarance Frank regarded it as &quot;A nice start to the &quot;Wave Race&quot; franchise which, while differing greatly from its later console counterparts, contained plenty of ideas that transferred successfully into the 3-D versions&quot;. In a series retrospective, Jon Partridge of &quot;Red Bull Games&quot; celebrated its fresh take on the racing genre, tight controls, gameplay, unique setting, and multiplayer.

==Legacy==
&quot;Wave Race&quot; sold well enough that it was eventually added to Nintendo&#x27;s Player&#x27;s Choice marketing label (a marketing label that promoted a lineup of the best selling Nintendo games). It was later followed by two sequels: &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; and &quot;Wave Race: Blue Storm&quot;. Unlike the first game, &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; and &quot;Wave Race: Blue Storm&quot; were also released in Japan.

<doc id="549175" wikidata="Q1750537" url="?curid=549175" title="Martin Jarvis (actor)">
<text>Martin Jarvis OBE (born 4 August 1941) is an English actor. Described by the BBC as &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s most distinguished and versatile actors&quot;, he has had a varied career in theatre, film and television, and is particularly noted for radio acting and voicing audiobooks.

==Early life and education==
Jarvis was born in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, to Denys Harry Jarvis and Margot Lillian Scottney, and grew up in South Norwood and Sanderstead, north Surrey.

Jarvis was educated at Whitgift School, an independent school in Croydon, and at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), where he won the Vanbrugh Award and the silver medal.

== Career ==

=== Theatre work ===
Jarvis has acted in many stage productions in London and abroad, including alongside Diana Rigg and Natascha McElhone in Joanna Murray-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Honour&quot; at London&#x27;s Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in 2006. His other stage work includes &quot;Woman in Mind&quot; and &quot;Henceforward...&quot; by Alan Ayckbourn, &quot;Other Places&quot; by Harold Pinter, &quot;Exchange&quot; by Michael Frayn, and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; by Oscar Wilde (opposite Judi Dench).

Jarvis appeared on Broadway in 2001 as P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s character Jeeves in the musical &quot;By Jeeves&quot;, a performance for which he was awarded a Theatre World Award.

=== Radio work ===
Jarvis has had a long association with the BBC, particularly BBC Radio 4. In the 1980s Michael Frayn&#x27;s columns for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;, described by some as models of the comic essay, were adapted and performed in many voices for BBC Radio 4 by Jarvis. He read a four part adaptation of John Gordon&#x27;s &quot;The Giant Under the Snow&quot; in 1981. He performs regularly in radio dramas and readings, both comic and serious. In David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Mind Your Pantheon&quot; he played the actor Strabo. He is known for his long series of readings of Richmal Crompton&#x27;s &quot;Just William&quot; stories, which show his characteristic and flexible reading voices. He has also narrated the Billy Bunter series by Frank Richards. As a result of this extensive work, Jarvis has been satirised in the radio show &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; by Mark Perry, highlighting his seeming ubiquity in Radio 4 programmes.

Jarvis has performed the role of Jeeves in multiple radio dramas based on P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s Jeeves stories, including the 1997 L.A. Theatre Works adaptation of &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;, the 2014 BBC radio adaptation of &quot;Ring for Jeeves&quot;, and the 2018 BBC radio adaptation of &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;. He performs live dramatic readings of some of the stories in the intermittent radio series &quot;Jeeves Live!&quot; (2007–2020).

In America, Jarvis and his wife Rosalind Ayres perform frequently in audio drama with the L.A. Theater Works and Hollywood Theater of the Ear.

In 2011, Jarvis appeared in a Radio 4 production of Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;In Praise of Love&quot;.

=== Television work ===
Jarvis&#x27;s first television appearance was in the BBC science fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Hilio, captain of the butterfly-like Menoptra, in &quot;The Web Planet&quot; (1965). He returned to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the scientist Dr. Butler in &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot; (1974) and as the beleaguered governor of the planet Varos in &quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot; (1985). He became a familiar face on television when he played Jon in the BBC&#x27;s landmark 1967 adaptation of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, the title role in a BBC serial of &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1968), &quot;The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1970) and Uriah Heep in the 1974 BBC version of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, and when he was the male lead in the sitcom &quot;Rings on Their Fingers&quot; (1978–80) with Diane Keen. In 1993, he starred with Ewan McGregor and Rachel Weisz in a BBC adaptation of &quot;Scarlet and Black&quot;. He also appeared in the 2002 BBC children&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Bootleg&quot;.

Jarvis appeared as a guest on 161 episodes of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Countdown&quot; between 1990 and 2008.

Jarvis&#x27;s appearances on American television include such series as &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;, and more recently &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Numb3rs&quot;. He also made a brief appearance as George VI in the ABC television miniseries &quot;&quot;.

<text>Hegyvidék (, literally &quot;&quot;Highlands&quot;, or &quot;Mountain-land&quot;&quot;) is the official name of the XII district of Budapest (), capital of Hungary. It is a region of Buda, on the west bank of river Danube.

== Geography ==

Being the only district in Buda which has not got a connection to the river Danube, it lies on the green, hilly suburban area of Budapest. It borders 2nd district to the north, the 1st district (Castle district and Gellérthegy) to the east and 11th district (Kelenföld and Sashegy) to the south. Its western border marks the border of the whole city as well. &quot;Hegyvidék&quot; is said to be the lung of Budapest, as it gives place to many of the untouched green forests of the city and it also houses the highest hill of the entire urban area, János Hill (527 m above sea level).

== Neighbourhoods ==
The district lies on 26.7 square kilometers and has around 60 thousand inhabitants. It has several neighbourhoods: Budakeszierdő, Csillebérc, Farkasrét, Farkasvölgy, Istenhegy, János Hill, Kissvábhegy, Krisztinaváros, Kútvölgy, Magasút, Mártonhegy, Németvölgy, Orbánhegy, Sashegy, Svábhegy, Széchenyihegy, Virányos, Zugliget.

<doc id="549179" wikidata="Q1147977" url="?curid=549179" title="Torre de Collserola">
<text>Torre de Collserola () is a uniquely designed tower located on the Tibidabo hill in the Serra de Collserola, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was designed by the architect Sir Norman Foster and by the Spanish civil engineers Julio Martínez Calzón and Manuel Julià Vilardell. This emblematic tower was built in 1991 by the construction company Cubiertas y MZOV S.A. for the 1992 Summer Olympics. It features a pod for floor space like many towers but uses guy wires for lateral support like a mast. Mainly used as a TV and radio transmitter, this futuristic design provides the highest viewpoint over the city. The top antenna reaches 288.4 m (946 ft) and the top of the pod, which has thirteen floors, reaches 152 m (499 ft). The highest point of this tower is the highest place one could be in the city of Barcelona. The tenth floor of the pod is open to the public.

==Events==
The tower has a space for event organisations, consisting of a reception room and an observation deck set 560 metres above sea level.

==Construction==
The tower has a hollow slip-formed, reinforced concrete main shaft of only 4.5 m diameter, which reduces to a mere 3 m to hold a radio mast which telescopes from 2.7 m to 0.7 m.
The thirteen floors are surrounded by a perimeter of open stainless steel grilles and suspended from the shaft by three primary vertical steel trusses.

The total weight of the tower is 3,000 tons.

A large number of cables keep the tower upright:

*The lower guys are composed three series of 180 parallel strand cables (15 mm diameter) made from pre-tensioned high-strength steel with a polyethylene covering, each;
*The upper guys are made of three series of 7 aramid fibre cables in parallel (56 mm diameter), each terminated with a resin socket. The three upper cables have a combined breaking strength of 4,200 tons.

<text>Septimius (or Septiminus) was a Roman usurper who was proclaimed Emperor in either 271 or 272 AD, under the reign of Aurelian.

==History==
Septimius declared himself emperor in either 271 or 272 AD, in Dalmatia, during the reign of Aurelian. The reason for his rebellion is not strictly known, although the threat of Gothic invasion may have played a part. He was killed by his own troops soon afterward.

<doc id="549186" wikidata="Q686544" url="?curid=549186" title="Donauturm">
<text>The Donauturm () is a tower located in the Donaupark, Vienna, Austria. Opened in April 1964, it is the tallest structure in Austria, standing at 252 meters (827 feet), and ranks as the 61st tallest tower in the world.

==History==
The Donauturm was built as an attraction for the Vienna International Garden Show 1964. It’s financing came largely from the Zentralsparkasse, with a small contribution from the Schwechat Brewery. The tower was designed by Hannes Lintl and Robert Krapfenbauer. The foundation stone was laid on October 12, 1962, and the tower was officially opened on April 16, 1964, the opening day of the garden show.

== Facilities ==

=== High-speed elevators ===

Two high-speed elevators transport passengers to the tower&#x27;s viewing platform at . Each lift, carrying up to 14 passengers, takes only 35 seconds to reach the observation platform. In strong winds, the elevators travel at only half speed because of the possible fluctuation of the tower: the movement of the elevator cable could be dangerous. By walking about 779 steps (775, according to architects Lintl), the platform can also be reached on foot. The stairs are, however, usually only accessible during the annual Donauturm run, or in an emergency.

=== Antennas and radio transmitter ===

The Donauturm spire carries antennas of cellular phone networks, private VHF radio stations and several other radio communication services. Despite its similarity to TV towers elsewhere, it has not been used for TV broadcasting. The major TV transmitter for the Vienna area is situated on Kahlenberg hill (&quot;see image at top&quot;).

=== Viewing platform ===

Two revolving restaurants (at a height of 161.2 and 169.4 metres, or 529 and 556 ft) offer a varied view over the Austrian capital and the Danube River below. It takes the platform either 26, 39 or 52 minutes to complete a full revolution. The restaurants were originally largely identical; now the top is an &quot;upscale&quot; restaurant (named &quot;Turm-Restaurant&quot;) and the lower restaurant is a café (named &quot;Turm-Café&quot;).


==Ballooning accident in 1968==
At a meeting of Pro Juventute on 6 June 1968, four gas balloons were launched from a meadow at Donauturm. While three of them floated past the tower, the fourth was driven against the tower, where it was initially hung on the security grills, at a height of approx. 150 m. The balloon net tore and the balloon envelope broke free. The remnants of the net and the basket fell to the ground. American balloonist Francis Shields died, along with two Austrian passengers: a higher official of the Austrian Post and Telegraph Management, Guntram Pammer, and journalist Dieter Kasper of the Austrian Press agency.

Footage of the incident appeared in the film &quot;Days of Fury&quot; (1979), directed by Fred Warshofsky and hosted by Vincent Price.

== Wikipedia naming controversy ==

The Donauturm shares some architectural features with the Fernsehturm Stuttgart, but was never planned for TV broadcasting purposes. The German Wikipedia had an approximately 600,000-character discussion about the suitable title and categories, as some authors, many of them Austrian, regarded the Donauturm as a mere observation tower. &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; coverage of the issue cited a participant with &quot;On good days, Wikipedia is better than any TV soap&quot;.

<doc id="549191" wikidata="Q1293008" url="?curid=549191" title="George Melly">
<text>Alan George Heywood Melly (17 August 1926 – 5 July 2007) was an English jazz and blues singer, critic, writer, and lecturer. From 1965 to 1973, he was a film and television critic for &quot;The Observer&quot;; he also lectured on art history, with an emphasis on surrealism.

==Early life and career==
Melly was born at The Grange, St Michael&#x27;s Hamlet, Toxteth, Liverpool, Lancashire, the elder son and eldest of three children of wool broker Francis Heywood Melly and (Edith) Maud, née Isaac. His mother was Jewish. Melly was a descendant of the shipowner and Liberal MP George Melly. He was also a relative of the philanthropist Emma Holt, of Sudley House Liverpool; her mother had married Melly&#x27;s great-grandfather.

Melly was educated at Stowe School, Buckinghamshire where he discovered his interest in modern art, jazz and blues and started coming to terms with his sexuality.

Melly was an atheist. Interviewed by Nigel Farndale in 2005, Melly said: &quot;I don&#x27;t understand people panicking about death. It&#x27;s inevitable. I&#x27;m an atheist; you&#x27;d think it would make it worse, but it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve done quite a lot in the world, not necessarily of great significance, but I have done it.&quot;

==Interest in surrealist art==
Melly once said that he may have been drawn to surrealism by a particular experience he had during his teenage years. A frequent visitor to Liverpool&#x27;s Sefton Park near his home, he often entered its tropical Palm House and there chatted to wounded soldiers from a nearby military hospital. It was the incongruity of this sight, men smoking among the exotic plants, dressed in their hospital uniforms and usually missing a limb, that he felt he later recognised in the work of the Surrealists.

He joined the Royal Navy at the end of the Second World War because, as he quipped to the recruiting officer, the uniforms were &quot;so much nicer&quot;. As he related in his autobiography &quot;Rum, Bum and Concertina&quot;, he was crestfallen to discover that he would not be sent to a ship and was thus denied the &quot;bell-bottom&quot; uniform he desired. Instead he received desk duty and wore the other Navy uniform, described as &quot;the dreaded fore-and-aft&quot;. Later, however, he did go to sea but never saw action; he was almost court-martialled for distributing anarchist literature.

==Postwar life and career==
After the war Melly found work in a London surrealist gallery, working with E. L. T. Mesens and eventually drifted into the world of jazz, finding work with Mick Mulligan&#x27;s Magnolia Jazz Band. This was a time (1948 onwards) when New Orleans and &quot;New Orleans Revival&quot; style jazz were very popular in Britain. In January 1963, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that the biggest trad jazz event to be staged in Britain had taken place at Alexandra Palace. The event included Alex Welsh, Diz Disley, Acker Bilk, Chris Barber, Kenny Ball, Ken Colyer, Monty Sunshine, Bob Wallis, Bruce Turner, Mick Mulligan and Melly.

In 1956 he became a writer on the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s satirical newspaper strip &quot;Flook&quot;, illustrated by Trog. He continued this until 1971. He retired from jazz in 1962 when he became a film critic for &quot;The Observer&quot; He was also scriptwriter on the 1967 satirical film &quot;Smashing Time&quot;. The period from 1948 until 1963 is described in &quot;Owning Up&quot;. He returned to jazz in the early 1970s with John Chilton&#x27;s Feetwarmers, a partnership that ended in 2003. He later sang with Digby Fairweather&#x27;s band. He released six albums in the 1970s including &quot;Nuts&quot; in 1972 and &quot;Son of Nuts&quot; the next year. He wrote a light column, &quot;Mellymobile&quot;, in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine describing their tours.

He was an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association. Melly was President of the BHA 1972–4, and was also an Honorary Associate of the Rationalist Association. He was also a member of the Max Miller Appreciation Society and, on 1 May 2005, joined Roy Hudd, Norman Wisdom, and others to unveil a statue of Miller in Brighton.

His singing style, in particular for the blues, was strongly influenced by his idol, Bessie Smith. While many British musicians of the time treated jazz and blues with almost religious solemnity, Melly rejoiced in their more bawdy side, and this was reflected in his choice of songs and exuberant stage performances. He recorded a track called &quot;Old Codger&quot; with The Stranglers in 1978, for which the lyrics were especially written for him by then band member, Hugh Cornwell.

Melly, who was bisexual, moved from strictly homosexual relationships in his teens and twenties to largely heterosexual relationships from his thirties onwards. He married twice and had a child from each marriage, though his first child Pandora was not known to be his until she was much older. 

He married his second wife, Diana Moynihan (née Dawson), in 1963 and they lived on Gloucester Crescent in Camden Town. She brought with her two children (Candy and Patrick) from two previous marriages. Patrick died from a heroin overdose in his twenties. Their own son, Tom, was born two days after the wedding. Diana published an autobiography, &quot;Take a Girl Like Me&quot;, describing their life and open marriage together, in 2005.

==Scethrog==
George and Diana Melly had a country retreat, Scethrog Tower in the Brecon Beacons, between 1971 and 1999. This was somewhere Melly could escape the jazz world and indulge his love of fishing on the River Usk. Jazz followed him to Wales and this led to a series of celebrated performances in the area and in the South Wales valleys. In 1984 the Brecon Jazz Festival was conceived by a group of jazz enthusiasts who gained widespread support from the local community. Melly was the first musician to be contracted for the opening festival and remained a supporter until his death. He was a factor in the festival&#x27;s success and served as its president in 1991. 

As well as being the President of the Contemporary Arts Society for Wales, Melly was a contemporary art collector. His passion for surrealist art continued throughout his life and he lectured and wrote extensively on the subject. His passion for fly-fishing never dwindled and in later life he sold several important paintings (by Magritte and Picasso) enabling him to buy a mile of land by the River Usk. In 2000 he published &quot;Hooked!&quot;, a book on fly-fishing.

==Later years and death==
Melly was still active in music, journalism, and lecturing on surrealism and other aspects of modern art until his death, despite worsening health problems such as vascular dementia, incipient emphysema, and lung cancer. His encouragement and support to gallery owner Michael Budd led to a posthumous exhibition for the modern abstract artist François Lanzi.

Melly suffered from environmental hearing loss because of long-term exposure to stage sound systems, and his hearing in both ears became increasingly poor. Despite these problems, Melly would often joke that he found some parts of his ailing health to be enjoyable. He often equated his dementia to a quite amusing LSD trip, and took a lot of pleasure from his deafness, which he said made many boring conversations more interesting. On Sunday 10 June 2007, Melly made an appearance, announced as his last ever performance, at the 100 Club in London. This was on the occasion of a fund-raising event to benefit the charity supporting his carers.

He died at his London home of lung cancer and emphysema (which he had for the last two years of his life), aged 80, on 5 July 2007. His humanist funeral was held at the West London Crematorium, in Kensal Green. The hearse was led by a jazz band, including Kenny Ball on trumpet, playing a New Orleans funeral march. His cardboard coffin was covered with old snapshots and cartoons of Melly by his friends, as well as hand-drawn decorations.

On 17 February 2008 BBC Two broadcast &quot;George Melly&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; (produced by Walker George Films), an intimate portrayal of Melly&#x27;s last months. His sister Andrée Melly was an actress, who lived in Ibiza with her husband, Oscar Quitak. In 2018 writer, musician and film maker Chris Wade made a documentary about Melly entitled &quot;The Certainty of Hazard&quot;, featuring his wife Diana, son Tom, and various friends and associates.

Diana Melly died on 2 February 2025, at the age of 87.

<text>Saint Petersburg Television Tower is a Russian steel lattice television tower in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Being the first dedicated television tower in the Soviet Union, the Saint Petersburg TV Tower is utilized for transmitting for FM-/TV-broadcasting throughout the federal city.

== History ==

The Saint Petersburg TV Tower&#x27;s construction commenced in 1962. Upon its completion in the same year, the tower was, and is, considered the first dedicated television tower to have ever served the Soviet Union, transmitting FM-/TV-broadcasting ever since.

== Geography ==

The Saint Petersburg TV Tower is situated at 3 Ulitsa Akademika Pavlova, which lies in the federal city of Saint Petersburg which, in turn, is the administrative centre of the Northwestern Federal District of the Russian Federation. The television tower is located in Central Saint Petersburg, wherein, several famous landmarks, such as famous parks and several embankments, can be found alongside and/or near the tower. In addition, the nearest metro station to the tower is the Petrogradskaya.

== Construction and structure ==

The Saint Petersburg TV Tower is a truss tower made up of steel, making it one of the sturdiest as well.

Being a dual-purpose tower, the Saint Petersburg TV Tower features an observation platform at a height of , thus, being an observation tower at the same time. In addition, the tower possesses an antenna necessary for transmission at a height of .

After installing a new antenna in June 2011, tower reached height of .

<doc id="549204" wikidata="Q215655" url="?curid=549204" title="Departments of Colombia">
<text>Colombia is a unitary republic made up of thirty-two administrative divisions referred to as departments (Spanish: &quot;departamentos&quot;, sing. ) and one Capital District (&quot;Distrito Capital&quot;). Departments are country subdivisions and are granted a certain degree of autonomy. Each department has a governor (&quot;gobernador&quot;) and an Assembly (&quot;Asamblea Departamental&quot;), elected by popular vote for a four-year period. The governor cannot be re-elected in consecutive periods.

Departments are formed by a grouping of municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;, sing. &quot;municipio&quot;). Municipal government is headed by mayor (&quot;alcalde&quot;) and administered by a municipal council (&quot;concejo municipal&quot;), both of which are elected by popular vote for four-year periods.

Some departments have subdivisions above the level of municipalities, commonly known as provinces.

== Current departments ==
=== Indigenous territories ===

The indigenous territories are at the third level of administrative division in Colombia, as are the municipalities. Indigenous territories are created by agreement between the government and indigenous communities. In cases where indigenous territories cover more than one department or municipality, local governments jointly administer them with the indigenous councils, as set out in Articles 329 and 330 of the Colombian Constitution of 1991. Also indigenous territories may achieve local autonomy if they meet the requirements of the law.

Article 329 of the 1991 constitution recognizes the collective indigenous ownership of indigenous territories and repeats that are inalienable. Law 160 of 1994 created the National System of Agrarian Reform and Rural Development Campesino, and replaced Law 135 of 1961 on Agrarian Social Reform; it establishes and sets out the functions of INCORA, one of the most important being to declare which territories will acquire the status of indigenous protection and what extension of existing ones will be allowed. Decree 2164 of 1995 interprets Law 160 of 1994, providing, among other things, a legal definition of indigenous territories.

Indigenous territories in Colombia are mostly in the departments of Amazonas, Cauca, La Guajira, Guaviare, and Vaupés.

== History ==

=== Historical predecessors of current departments ===


=== The Republic of Gran Colombia ===

When it was first established in 1819, The Republic of Gran Colombia had three departments. Venezuela, Cundinamarca (now Colombia) and Quito (now Ecuador). In 1824, the Distrito del Centro (which became Colombia) was divided into five departments and further divided into seventeen provinces. One department, Isthmus Department, consisting of two provinces, later became the sovereign country of Panama.

===Republic of New Granada===

With the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1826 by the Revolution of the Morrocoyes (&quot;La Cosiata&quot;), New Granada kept its 17 provinces. In 1832 the provinces of Vélez and Barbacoas were created, and in 1835 those of Buenaventura and Pasto were added. In 1843 those of Cauca, Mompós and Túquerres were created. At this time the cantons (&quot;cantones&quot;) and parish districts were created, which provided the basis for the present-day municipalities.

By 1853 the number of provinces had increased to thirty-six, namely:Antioquia, Azuero, Barbacoas, Bogotá, Buenaventura, Cartagena, Casanare, Cauca, Chiriquí, Chocó, Córdova, Cundinamarca, García Rovira, Mariquita, Medellín, Mompós, Neiva, Ocaña, Pamplona, Panamá, Pasto, Popayán, Riohacha, Sabanilla, Santa Marta, Santander, Socorro, Soto, Tequendama, Tunja, Tundama, Túquerres, Valle de Upar, Veraguas, Vélez and Zipaquirá. However, the new constitution of 1853 introduced federalism, which lead to the consolidation of provinces into states. By 1858 this process was complete, with a resulting eight federal states: Panamá was formed in 1855, Antioquia in 1856, Santander in May 1857, and Bolívar, Boyacá, Cauca, Cundinamarca and Magdalena were formed in June 1858. 1861 saw the creation of the final federal state of Tolima.

===Republic of Colombia===
The Colombian Constitution of 1886 converted the states of Colombia into departments, with the state presidents renamed as governors. The states formed the following original departments:
* Antioquia Department
* Bolívar Department
* Boyacá Department
* Cauca Department
* Cundinamarca Department
* Magdalena Department
* Panamá Department
* Santander Department
* Tolima Department

<text>A department of motor vehicles (DMV) is a government agency that administers motor vehicle registration and driver licensing. In countries with federal states such as in North America, these agencies are generally administered by subnational entities governments, while in unitary states such as many of those in Europe, DMVs are organized nationally by the central government.

==Terminology and organization==
Driver licensing and vehicle registration in the United States are handled by the state government in all states but Hawaii, where local governments perform DMV functions. In Canada, driver licensing and vehicle registration are handled at the provincial government level.

===United States===

The Uniform Vehicle Code prefers the name &quot;Department of Motor Vehicles&quot;. The acronym &quot;DMV&quot; is most commonly used to describe the agency (where it exists); however, diverse titles are used in different jurisdictions.


==== Organization within state government ====
The location of a department or division of motor vehicles within the structure of a state&#x27;s government tends to vary widely.

Hawaii is the only U.S. state where no part of the state government performs DMV functions; it has completely delegated vehicle registration and driver licensing to county governments.

In Kentucky, the Transportation Cabinet sets the policies and designs for licenses and vehicle registration; but the actual registration and licensing are handled by county clerks&#x27; (vehicle registration) and Circuit Court clerks&#x27; (drivers licensing) offices. Likewise, in Tennessee, the Department of Revenue and the Driver License Services Division of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security establishes policies and designs for licenses and vehicle registration, but the actual registration and licensing are handled by county clerks.

In the District of Columbia, which is not part of any state, the DMV (formerly the Bureau of Motor Vehicle Services) is part of the city government.

In Virginia, the Department of Motor Vehicles handles both driver licensing and vehicle registration, while the Virginia State Police and the Department of Environmental Quality administer safety inspection and emission inspection, respectively. The program is simply &quot;administered&quot; by the state; actual inspections are performed by specific authorized employees of privately owned gas stations and garages licensed by the state.

In some states, the DMV is not a separate cabinet-level department, but instead is a division or bureau within a larger department. Departments that perform DMV functions include the Department of Justice (Montana), the Department of Public Safety (Texas, Ohio), the Department of Revenue (Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado), and the Department of Transportation (Arizona, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin). In New Hampshire and Tennessee, the Division of Motor Vehicles and the Driver License Services Division, respectively, is a division of each state&#x27;s Department of Safety (in Tennessee, Department of Safety and Homeland Security). In Vermont, the Department of Motor Vehicles is a subunit of the state Agency of Transportation.

Some states do not separate DMV functions into distinct organizational entities at all, but simply bundle them into responsibilities assigned to an existing government agency. For example, in the state of Washington, the Department of Licensing is responsible for driver&#x27;s licenses and vehicle and boat registrations in addition to most other business and occupational licensing. In Maine, Michigan, and Illinois, the Secretary of State&#x27;s offices perform responsibilities that would be handled by the DMV in other states.

====Jurisdiction and exceptions====

Almost all long-term residents (&quot;long term&quot; in this case means over 30 days) of a state who wish to operate motor vehicles must possess a driver&#x27;s license issued by their state DMV, and their vehicles must show license plates (and current registration tags or stickers) issued by that agency.

Armed Forces active duty service members are an exception to this general rule; by federal law, servicemembers do not change legal residence when relocating to a new duty station unless they take voluntary action to do so. These individuals have the option of retaining the license and vehicle registration of their legal residence or obtaining a new license and registration locally. Some states also let out-of-state college students maintain their existing license and/or registration.

The federal government registers vehicles which it owns or leases through the General Services Administration (GSA), a federal agency, rather than with any state or territorial DMV. GSA contracts with Federal Prison Industries for the manufacturing of &quot;U.S. Government&quot; plates to be mounted on such vehicles. However, federal employees authorized to drive such vehicles must still be licensed by their home state or territory.

The Office of Foreign Missions at the U.S. Department of State has a Diplomatic Motor Vehicles program that issues driver&#x27;s licenses to foreign diplomats and their dependents, registers their vehicles, and issues special diplomatic license plates.

===Canada===


===Mexico===


===Europe===

==Areas of responsibility==

===Driver&#x27;s licenses and identification===

In countries with no national identification card (like the United States), driver&#x27;s licenses have often become the &quot;de facto&quot; identification card for many purposes, and DMV agencies have effectively become the agency responsible for verifying identity in their respective states, even the identity of non-drivers. The REAL ID Act of 2005 is an attempt to provide a national standard for identification cards in the United States as identification cards are commonly used in everyday life.

===Driver certification===
In some states, besides conducting the written and hands-on driving tests that are a prerequisite to earning a driver&#x27;s license, DMVs also regulate private driving schools and their instructors. All DMVs issue their state&#x27;s driver&#x27;s manual, which all drivers are expected to know and abide by. Knowledge of the driver&#x27;s manual is tested prior to issuing a permit or license.

===Vehicle registration===
DMVs are responsible for providing an identification number for vehicles, either with a permanent vehicle registration plate or temporary tag. See also Vehicle registration plates of the United States. A vehicle registration program tracks detailed vehicle information, such as odometer history, to prevent automobile-related crimes such as odometer fraud.

Many DMVs allow third parties to issue registration materials. These may include companies that specialize in processing registration application paperwork (often called &quot;tag agents&quot;) or car dealers. Tag agents are given direct access to DMV systems (as in Louisiana). Dealers often use their state DMV&#x27;s electronic vehicle registration (EVR) program.

===Vehicle ownership===
The certification of ownership of automotive vehicles is handled by each state&#x27;s DMV normally by issuing a vehicle title. The types of vehicles certified by a DMV varies by state. While almost all DMVs title vehicles that are driven on roadways, the responsibility to title boats, mobile homes, and off-road vehicles can be the responsibility of other agencies such as a Department of Natural Resources (DNR).

As the issuer of vehicle titles, DMVs are also usually responsible for recording liens made with an automobile as collateral on a secured loan. Several DMVs provide an Electronic Lien and Title program for lienholders.

===Law enforcement===

Duties of the DMV include enforcement of state and federal laws regarding motor vehicles. Many departments have sworn law enforcement officers who enforce DMV regulations that are codified in state law. In North Carolina, for example, the DMV contains an element known as &quot;License and Theft.&quot; Stolen motor vehicles are tracked down by &quot;Inspectors,&quot; sworn law enforcement officers of the state employed by the DMV, and suspected cases of fraudulent registrations, license plates, and/or theft of those elements are investigated. Inspectors also investigate independent inspection stations licensed by the DMV. At times, some of these stations violate DMV regulations codified by law. The most common of these violations is passing inspection for a vehicle with windows tinted below the legal limits. The penalty for such a violation is a $1,000 fine and, for first time offenders, a revocation of the inspection permit for 30 days. Inspection stations face permanent permit revocation for subsequent offenses. In New York, the Division of Field Investigations (DFI) is the criminal investigations arm of the DMV. It employs investigators to combat auto theft, identity theft, and fraudulent document-related crimes that take place in New York. These investigators are armed New York State peace officers with statewide authority to enforce laws and handle investigations. In Texas, the Automobile Burglary and Theft Prevention Authority (ABTPA) educates Texans on how to protect themselves from motor vehicle theft and awards financial grants to curtail auto theft and burglary. The division is also involved in a program that helps to prevent stolen motor vehicles from entering Mexico.

Compared to standard law enforcement officers, DMV law enforcement agents operate with greater flexibility when it comes to their specific police powers. If a person under investigation by the DMV refuses to answer questions or meet with DMV law enforcement agents, their registration and tags may be canceled. Although a citizen has a constitutional right not to speak or meet with sworn law enforcement officers while under investigation, no constitutional right protects a person&#x27;s motor vehicle registration with a state agency. Another example of this flexibility of police powers is found in the policies of many states regarding suspected DUI offenders. If a person is stopped by police under suspicion of driving while impaired, and refuses a breath test to determine blood alcohol content, the DMV automatically revokes that person&#x27;s license for one year. Even if evidence of that person&#x27;s impairment is found insufficient at trial, the individual loses their driving privileges simply for having refused the sobriety test.

===General identification===
In most states, a separate identification card indicating residency is optionally provided in the case that one does not have a driver&#x27;s license.

===Liquor ID===
A liquor identification is also provided in some jurisdictions for residents to affirm their age of majority to sellers of liquor, although a state-issued ID that proves the individual is over the legal drinking age often suffices. This is another measure to prevent minors from purchasing alcohol.

<text>Brigadier-General Stand Watie (; December 12, 1806September 9, 1871), also known as Standhope Uwatie and Isaac S. Watie, was a Cherokee politician who served as the second principal chief of the Cherokee Nation from 1862 to 1866. The Cherokee Nation allied with the Confederate States during the American Civil War, and he was subsequently the only Native American Confederate general officer. Watie commanded Indian forces in the Trans-Mississippi Theater, made up mostly of Cherokee, Muskogee, and Seminole. He was the last Confederate States Army general to surrender.

Before removal of the Cherokee to Indian Territory in the late 1830s, Watie and his older brother Elias Boudinot were among Cherokee leaders who signed the Treaty of New Echota in 1835. The majority of the tribe opposed their action. In 1839, the brothers were attacked in an assassination attempt, as were other relatives active in the Treaty Party. All but Stand Watie were killed. Watie in 1842 killed one of his uncle&#x27;s attackers, and in 1845 his brother Thomas was killed in retaliation, in a continuing cycle of violence that reached Indian Territory. Watie was acquitted by the Cherokee at trial in the 1850s on the grounds of self-defense.

Watie led the Southern Cherokee delegation to Washington, D.C., after the American Civil War to sue for peace, hoping to have tribal divisions recognized. The federal government negotiated only with the leaders who had sided with the Union. Watie stayed out of politics for his last years, and tried to rebuild his plantation.

== Early life ==
Stand Watie was born on December 12, 1806, at Oothcaloga, Cherokee Nation (present-day Calhoun, Georgia), the son of &quot;Uwatie&quot; (Cherokee for &quot;the ancient one&quot;, sometimes spelled &quot;Oowatie&quot;), a full-blood Cherokee, and Susanna Reese, daughter of a white father and Cherokee mother. He was named &quot;Degataga&quot;. According to one biography, this name means &quot;standing firm&quot; when translated to English. Watie&#x27;s brothers were Gallagina, nicknamed &quot;Buck&quot; (who later took the name Elias Boudinot), and Thomas Watie. They were close to their paternal uncle Major Ridge, and his son John Ridge, both later leaders in the tribe. By 1827, their father David Uwatie had become a wealthy planter, who held African-American slaves as laborers.

After Uwatie converted to Christianity with the Moravians, he took the name of David Uwatie; he and Susanna renamed &quot;Degataga&quot; as Isaac. In his life, &quot;Degataga&quot; preferred to use &quot;Stand&quot;, a loose translation of his Cherokee name. Later, the family dropped the &quot;U&quot; from the spelling of their surname, using &quot;Watie.&quot; Along with his two brothers and sisters, Watie learned to read and write English at the Moravian mission school in Spring Place, Cherokee Nation (now Georgia).

Stand Watie occasionally helped write articles for the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; newspaper, for which his older brother Elias served as editor from 1828 to 1832. The first Native American newspaper, the &quot;Phoenix&quot; published articles in both Cherokee and English.

Watie became involved in the dispute over Georgia&#x27;s repressive anti-Indian laws. After gold was discovered on Cherokee lands in northern Georgia, thousands of white settlers encroached on Indian lands. There was continuing conflict, and Congress passed the 1830 Indian Removal Act, to relocate all Indians from the Southeast to lands west of the Mississippi River. In 1832, Georgia confiscated most of the Cherokee land, despite federal laws to protect Native Americans from state actions. The state sent militia to destroy the offices and press of the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot;, which had published articles against Indian Removal.

Believing that removal was inevitable, the Watie brothers favored securing Cherokee rights by treaty before relocating to Indian Territory. They were among the Treaty Party leaders who signed the 1835 Treaty of New Echota.

== Indian Territory ==
In 1835, Watie, his family, and many other Cherokee emigrated to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). They joined some Cherokee who had relocated as early as the 1820s and were known as the &quot;Old Settlers&quot;. Those Cherokee who remained on tribal lands in the East were rounded up and forcibly removed by the U.S. government in 1838. Their journey became known as the &quot;Trail of Tears,&quot; as 4,000 people died.

After removal, members of the Cherokee government carried out sentences against Treaty Party men for execution; their giving up tribal lands was a &quot;blood&quot; or capital offense under Cherokee law. Stand Watie, his brother Elias Boudinot, their uncle Major Ridge and cousin John Ridge, along with several other Treaty Party men, were all sentenced to death on June 22, 1839; only Stand Watie survived. He arranged for his brother Elias&#x27; children to be sent for their safety and education to their mother&#x27;s family in Connecticut; their mother Harriet had died in 1836 before the migration.

In 1842, Watie encountered James Foreman, whom he recognized as one of his uncle&#x27;s executioners, and killed him. This was part of the post-Removal violence within the tribe, which was close to civil war for years. Ross supporters executed Stand&#x27;s brother Thomas Watie in 1845.
In the 1850s, Stand Watie was tried in Arkansas for the murder of Foreman; he was acquitted on the grounds of self-defense. His nephew E. C. Boudinot, who had returned to the West and become a lawyer, defended him.

== American Civil War ==
In 1861, Principal Chief John Ross signed an alliance with the Confederate States to avoid disunity in Indian Territory. Within less than a year, Ross and part of the National Council concluded that the agreement had proved disastrous. In the summer of 1862, Ross removed the tribal records to Union-held Kansas and then proceeded to Washington, D.C., to meet with President Lincoln. After Ross fled to Federal-controlled territory, Watie replaced him as principal chief. After Ross&#x27; departure, Tom Pegg took over as principal chief of the pro-Union Cherokee. Following Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, Pegg called a special session of the Cherokee National Council. On February 18, 1863, it passed a resolution to emancipate all slaves within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation.

After many Cherokee fled north to Kansas or south to Texas for safety, pro-Confederates took advantage of the instability and elected Stand Watie principal chief. Ross&#x27; supporters refused to recognize the validity of the election. Open warfare broke out between Confederate and Union Cherokee within Indian Territory, the damage heightened by brigands with no allegiance at all. After the Civil War ended, both factions sent delegations to Washington. Watie pushed for recognition of a separate &quot;Southern Cherokee Nation&quot;, but never achieved that.
Watie was the only Native American to rise to a Confederate brigadier-general&#x27;s rank during the war. Fearful of the Federal Government and the threat to create a State (Oklahoma) out of most of what was then the semi-sovereign &quot;Indian Territory&quot;, a majority of the Cherokee Nation initially voted to support the Confederacy in the American Civil War for pragmatic reasons, though less than a tenth of the Cherokee owned slaves. Watie organized a regiment of mounted infantry. In October 1861, he was commissioned as colonel in what would become the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles.

Although Watie fought Federal troops, he also led his men in fighting between factions of the Cherokee and in attacks on Cherokee civilians and farms, as well as against the Creek, Seminole and others in Indian Territory who chose to support the Union. Watie is noted for his role in the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, on March 6–8, 1862. Under the overall command of General Benjamin McCulloch, Watie&#x27;s troops captured Union artillery positions and covered the retreat of Confederate forces from the battlefield after the Union took control. However, most of the Cherokees who had joined Colonel John Drew&#x27;s regiment defected to the Union side. Drew, a nephew of Chief Ross, remained loyal to the Confederacy.

In August 1862, after John Ross and his followers announced their support for the Union and went to Fort Leavenworth, the remaining Southern Confederate minority faction elected Stand Watie as principal chief. After Cherokee support for the Confederacy sharply declined, Watie continued to lead the remnant of his cavalry. He was appointed to the grade of Brigadier-General on May 10, 1864, with a date of rank of May 6, though he did not receive word of his promotion until after he led the ambush of the steamboat &quot;J. R. Williams&quot; on July 16, 1864. Watie commanded the First Indian Brigade of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi, composed of two regiments of Mounted Rifles and three battalions of Cherokee, Seminole and Osage infantry. 

They fought in a number of battles and skirmishes in the western Confederate states, including the Indian Territory, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and Texas. Watie&#x27;s force reportedly fought in more battles west of the Mississippi River than any other unit. Watie took part in what is considered to be the greatest (and most famous) Confederate victory in Indian Territory, the Second Battle of Cabin Creek, which took place in what is now Mayes County, Oklahoma on September 19, 1864. He and General Richard Montgomery Gano led a raid that captured a Federal wagon train and netted approximately $1 million worth of wagons, mules, commissary supplies, and other needed items. Stand Watie&#x27;s forces massacred black haycutters at Wagoner, Oklahoma during this raid. Union reports said that Watie&#x27;s Indian cavalry &quot;killed all the Negroes they could find&quot;, including wounded men.

Since most Cherokee were now Union supporters, during the war, General Watie&#x27;s family and other Confederate Cherokee took refuge in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas. 

The Confederate Army put Watie in command of the Indian Division of Indian Territory in February 1865. By then, however, the Confederates were no longer able to fight in the territory effectively. On June 23, 1865, at Doaksville in the Choctaw Nation (now Oklahoma), Watie signed a cease-fire agreement with Union representatives for his command, the First Indian Brigade of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi. He was the last Confederate general in the field to surrender.

In September 1865, after his demobilization, Watie went to Texas to see his wife Sallie and to mourn the death of their son, Comisky, who had died at age 15. After the war, Watie was a member of the Cherokee Delegation to the Southern Treaty Commission, which renegotiated treaties with the United States.

== Later life ==

The U.S. government, recognizing that the two factions would never agree on common terms, decided to negotiate with them separately and play them against each other. By doing so, it was able to extract a number of concessions from both sides. The resulting treaty required the Cherokee to free their slaves. The Southern Cherokee wanted the government to pay to relocate the Cherokee Freedmen from their lands. The Northern Cherokee suggested adopting them into the tribe, but wanted the federal government to give the Freedman an exclusive piece of associated territory. The federal government required that the Cherokee Freedmen would receive full rights for citizenship, land, and annuities as the Cherokee. It assigned them land in the Canadian addition. This treaty was signed by Ross on July 19, 1866, and ratified by the U.S. Senate on July 27, four days before Ross&#x27; death.

The tribe was strongly divided over the treaty issues and a new chief was elected, Lewis Downing, a full-blood and compromise candidate. He was a shrewd and politically savvy Principal Chief, bringing about reconciliation and reunification among the Cherokee.

After the treaty signing, Watie had gone into exile in the Choctaw Nation. Shortly after Downing&#x27;s election, he returned to the Cherokee. Watie tried to stay out of politics and rebuild his fortunes. He returned to Honey Creek, where he died on September 9, 1871. Watie was buried in the old Ridge Cemetery, later called Polson&#x27;s Cemetery, in what is now Delaware County, Oklahoma, as a citizen of the Cherokee Nation.

==Personal life==
After moving to Indian Territory, Stand Watie married Sarah Bell on September 18, 1842. Their families had been long-time friends. They had three sons: Saladin, Solon and Cumiska, and two daughters, Minnee and Jacqueline. Saladin died while the family was living at Mount Tabor / Bellview, Texas (the home of his in-laws the Bells) in 1868, while Solon died during the following year. Both daughters died not long after their father. Sarah died in 1884. One source states that Stand Watie married four women: Eleanor Looney, Elizabeth Fields, Isabella Hicks, and Sarah Caroline Bell. His child with Elizabeth Fields was stillborn in 1836.

== In popular culture ==
* Stand Watie is featured occasionally in &quot;Rifles for Watie&quot;, a 1957 novel by Harold Keith. It portrays the experiences of a young Union soldier from Kansas, who meets Watie and his people in Tahlequah.
* He was featured as a character in the film &quot;The Great Sioux Uprising&quot; (1953), played by Glenn Strange.
* The song &quot;Coyotes,&quot; recorded by Don Edwards, is a longtime cowboy&#x27;s lament about losses from the Old West: Comanches, outlaws, longhorns, Geronimo, the red wolf, and Stand Watie.&quot;
* In &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;, chiefly set after the Civil War and based on the books &quot;The Rebel Outlaw: Josey Wales&quot; and its sequel &quot;The Vengeance Trail of Josey Wales&quot;, the character of Lone Watie (played by Chief Dan George) is described as a cousin of Stand Watie.
* On June 13, 2020, following the George Floyd protests, a 1921 monument to Stand Watie and a 1913 monument to Confederate soldiers were removed from the Cherokee Capitol grounds in Tahlequah. Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. insisted the reason was because it was the Daughters of the Confederacy, and not the Cherokee Nation, who had commissioned and erected the monuments. The monuments were placed in storage by the Cherokee Nation.

<text>Westfield Sportscars is a manufacturer of both factory built and kit versions of several two-seater, open top sportscars. Their main product is a Lotus Seven inspired car – vehicles originally designed by Colin Chapman with only the bare essentials for motoring in order to give the rawest and most exhilarating driving experience.

==History==
Whilst Caterham Cars bought the rights from Lotus Cars, Chris Smith set up a rival company and manufactured kits with very similar styling and construction. This led Caterham to threaten litigation (based on Industrial design rights) in the late 1980s which was eventually settled out of court and resulted in Westfield improving and changing the design of their cars. Whilst externally sharing a common look, Westfield and Caterham cars are somewhat different in construction. Westfield prefers to employ the same glass fibre body method that Lotus has traditionally used for their other models such as the Elise, Esprit, and Elan, rather than the aluminium used by Caterham.

Westfield also pioneered technical innovations such as independent rear suspension and a wider chassis, which other manufacturers have since adopted. The company introduced a version of its SEi kit that uses donor parts from the Mazda MX-5, with another kit also sold that used a Ford Sierra as a donor. The wide range of drivetrain configurations available to Westfield customers also included the Honda S2000 engine and gearbox as part of the company&#x27;s MegaS2000 kit and cars.

According to figures given to the magazine Total Kit Car, Westfield produced about 450 SEi and XTR chassis each year.

In the first series of BBC&#x27;s Top Gear, a Westfield XTR2 driven by the black Stig set a faster lap time than the reigning record holder of that series, the Pagani Zonda.

In December 2006, Westfield became a part of Potenza Sports Cars. In December 2007, it was announced that GTM Cars also became a part of Potenza Sports Cars.

In June 2009 Westfield became the first Niche Vehicle Manufacturer to be awarded European Small Series Production Status with its Sport Turbo model, and has subsequently produced the – an all-electric racing vehicle, as well as a hybrid vehicle version of the Sport Turbo model.

In 2019, Westfield Sportscars acquired Chesil Motor Company.

In June 2022 Westfield went into administration and ceased trading.
In September 2022 Westfield was bought out of insolvency by &quot;Westfield Chesil Ltd.&quot;. They relocated from Kingswinford to Bicester.

<doc id="549239" wikidata="Q36398" url="?curid=549239" title="Sheng slang">
<text>Sheng is primarily a Swahili and English-based cant, slang, perhaps a mixed language or creole, originating among the urban youth of Nairobi, Kenya, and influenced by many of the languages spoken there. While primarily a language of urban youths, it has spread across social classes and geographically to neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda.
It is a language variety spoken as a lingua franca across Kenya. For many years, it has been used on school playgrounds and campuses and in political campaigns, and today It is forcing its way into spoken media.
Sheng expressions are neither standardised nor taught in any formal establishments, but rather function in daily discourse, usually in informal settings. Kenyan speakers regularly mix several slang in their conversations regardless of origin, but depending on the audience and the familiarity level with the listeners.
Sheng unites the different ethnic groups in the country, especially in their trade and social interaction with each other. English and Swahili is Kenya&#x27;s official languages, and Sheng, despite its common use throughout the country, has no official status.

==Etymology and history==
The word &quot;Sheng&quot; is coined from the two languages that it is mainly derived from: Swahili and English. The &quot;h&quot; was included from the middle of &quot;Swahili&quot; because &quot;Seng&quot; would have sounded unusual. The term is first recorded in 1965.

Originating in the early 1950s in the Eastlands area of Nairobi (variously described as a &quot;slum&quot;, &quot;ghetto&quot; or &quot;suburb&quot;), Sheng is now heard among matatu drivers/touts across the region, and in the popular media. Most of the Sheng words are introduced in various communities and schools and given wide exposure by music artists who include them in their lyrics, hence the rapid growth. It can be assumed to be the first language of many Kenyans in urban areas.

Like all slang, Sheng is mainly used by the youth and is part of popular culture in Kenya. It also evolves rapidly, as words are moved into and out of slang use. It found broad usage among hip hop artists such as Kalamashaka and G.rongi in the African Great Lakes region in the &#x27;90s, both mainstream and &quot;underground&quot; (whose music helped spread the language and contribute to rapid changes or shifts in Sheng vocabulary), as well as among virtually all university and secondary-school students, the language was not always associated with people who cannot do much for the society until when the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation noted the rise in both class and diversity. Radio presenters John Karani, Jeff Mwangemi and Prince Otach, and many more, took it to the mainstream by presenting the first radio shows using Sheng phrases on the national broadcast. By 2010 almost every media show had some sort of sheng in it.

Although the grammar, syntax, and much of the vocabulary are drawn from Swahili, Sheng borrows from the languages of some of the largest ethnic groups in Kenya, including Luhya, Gĩkũyũ, Luo and Kamba. Words are also borrowed from languages that are neither a local language nor English – such as the Sheng word &quot;morgen&quot; &quot;morning&quot; – a Sheng word used in some areas with a similar meaning in German.

Sheng vocabulary can vary significantly within Kenya&#x27;s various subdivisions and the larger African Great Lakes region, and even between neighbourhoods in Nairobi. Many youth living in the capital often use the argot as their everyday mode of communication rather than Swahili or English.

Many Gen Z and Millennials easily adapt to other variants of Sheng like Shembeteng, Shengilo and Shengtezo.

The use of social media platforms like TikTok have contributed to the growth of Sheng.

==Sheng in literature==

The written use of Sheng in literature is still a minor phenomenon. Some poems in the African literary magazine &quot;Kwani?&quot; have been published in Sheng, but the first and only book in this language is &quot;Lafudhi hip hop poetry in Sheng&quot; (2015), written by G rongi.

<doc id="549251" wikidata="Q1754136" url="?curid=549251" title="This Mortal Coil">
<text>This Mortal Coil were a British music collective led by Ivo Watts-Russell, founder of the British record label 4AD. Although Watts-Russell and John Fryer were the only two official members, the band&#x27;s recorded output featured a large rotating cast of supporting artists, many of whom were otherwise associated with 4AD, including members of Cocteau Twins, Pixies and Dead Can Dance. The project became known for its gothic, dream pop sound, and released three full albums, beginning in 1984 with &quot;It&#x27;ll End in Tears&quot;.

==Background==
Watts-Russell had founded 4AD in 1980, and the label established itself as one of the key labels in the British post-punk movement. Following several releases, Watts-Russell developed the idea of collaborating under the name This Mortal Coil. The name is taken from lyrics to the song Dream Within A Dream by Spirit (&quot;...Stepping off this mortal coil will be my pleasure...&quot;), which in turn is a quote from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (&quot;... what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil...&quot;).

The 4AD website said:

One of the label&#x27;s earliest signings was Modern English. In 1983, Watts-Russell suggested that the band re-record two of its earliest songs, &quot;Sixteen Days&quot; and &quot;Gathering Dust&quot;, as a medley. At the time, the band was closing its set with this medley, and Watts-Russell felt it was strong enough to warrant a re-recording. When the band rebuffed the idea, Watts-Russell decided to assemble a group of musicians to record the medley: Elizabeth Fraser and Robin Guthrie of Cocteau Twins; Gordon Sharp of Cindytalk (later known as Cindy Sharp or Cinder); and a few members of Modern English. An EP, &quot;Sixteen Days/Gathering Dust&quot;, resulted from these sessions. A cover of Tim Buckley&#x27;s &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;, performed by Fraser and Guthrie alone, was recorded as a B-side for the EP. Pleased with the results, Watts-Russell decided to make this the A-side of the 7&quot; single version of the EP, and the song quickly became an underground hit, leading Watts-Russell to pursue the recording of a full album under the This Mortal Coil moniker, 1984&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;ll End in Tears&quot;.

In June 1998, Watts-Russell began releasing albums in a similar vein to his TMC projects, under the name The Hope Blister.

<text>Sit-Up Ltd., traded as Bid Shopping, was an English broadcaster which launched in 2000. It operated a portfolio of falling price shopping television channels to over 12 million homes in the UK.

==History==
On 1 April 2009, it was announced that Sit-Up Ltd had been sold by Virgin Media to Aurelius AG. The purchase price or terms of the agreement have not been disclosed. Virgin Media had previously owned the company – this followed partial ownership prior to May 2005. Bid Shopping ran the channels Bid and Price Drop each day from 7:45am through to 1:30am. The channels were designed to sell consumer products via digital TV (currently carried by digital satellite, cable, and terrestrial) or the Internet.

On 1 August 2011, &#x27;Sit-Up&#x27; was renamed &#x27;Bid Shopping&#x27;, with &#x27;Bid TV&#x27;, &#x27;Price-Drop TV&#x27; and &#x27;Speed Auction TV&#x27; becoming &#x27;Bid&#x27;, &#x27;Price Drop&#x27; and &#x27;Speed Auction&#x27; respectively.

On 21 May 2013, it was announced that the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) had referred Sit-Up Limited to Ofcom for consideration of statutory sanctions following repeated breaches of the UK Code of Broadcast Advertising. Ofcom has confirmed that it has accepted the referral.

Since January 2012, there have been 33 ASA rulings against Sit-Up Ltd. The two main types of problem have been misleading pricing claims and misleading product descriptions.

In December 2013, the struggling Bid Shopping group was taken over by former Corporate Restructuring Lawyer Bryan Green; the channel posted pre-tax losses of £7.4m in 2011 and a 10% fall in sales.

In February 2014, it was revealed Bid Shopping had debts of £68m and was looking to enter a voluntary agreement with its creditors to keep the company going.

On 10 March 2014, Bid was rebranded as &#x27;Shop at Bid&#x27; and took on a more traditional shopping channel look with the premium rate number replaced with a number costing 20p per minute, it also appears the channel is no longer having auctions and has gone for a traditional sell and buy format.

On 17 April 2014, Bid Shopping was put into administration; Shop at Bid and its sister channel Price Drop were closed down with immediate effect with around 200 jobs being lost.

On 18 February 2015, Grant Miller, through the company Bid Shopping Limited, acquired the intellectual property, patents, brands and domains of Sit-Up, which resulted in Sit-Up emerging from administration. The company is now working on re-launching the channel via online and selected TV broadcasting in the near future.

Bid TV announced via Twitter it will relaunch as an online channel on 4 January 2016 first, then to relaunch on TV during later in the year but due to technical difficulties, they had to delay it again for the 3rd time. The Twitter page has since been left inactive after the tweet, The email for sit-up no longer exists.

==Channels==
In early January 2005, it was announced that Sit-Up would launch two free-to-air movie channels called Real-movies.tv and Movies on 333. Real-movies.tv was to be female orientated with an emphasis on true stories, whilst Movies on 333 (intended for Sky Digital channel 333) would focus on western and niche films.

However, another company would launch their own free-to-air movie channel just ahead of Sit-Up&#x27;s in the 333 slot; True Movies was also female orientated with an emphasis on true stories. Sit-Up changed their original channel proposals, with Matinee Movies and Bad Movies emerging as their new channels (details below), which both launched on 25 April 2005.

===Shop at Bid===

Shop at Bid (formerly known as &quot;Bid-Up.TV&quot; until 21 January 2005, &quot;Bid TV&quot; until 1 August 2011, and &quot;Bid&quot; until 10 March 2014) was a television shopping channel. It was the first auction channel of its kind in the UK.

The channel was launched on 5 October 2000. It started by broadcasting 12 hours a day, many of which were pre-recorded, with auction graphics overlaid so people could bid although the video itself was pre-recorded. It broadcast live for almost 18 hours a day from 07:45 to 01:30. Shop at Bid was available on Freeview channel 23, Virgin Media channel 745, Sky channel 645, Freesat channel 802, and WightFibre channel 704. It closed on 17 April 2014, because of Bid Shopping&#x27;s closure.

===Price Drop===

Price Drop (formerly known as &quot;Price-Drop.TV&quot; until 21 January 2005 and as &quot;Price-Drop TV&quot; until 1 August 2011) was a television shopping channel that focuses on falling price auctions. Price Drop&#x27;s channel format was the first of its type in the UK, using a falling price dynamic.

The channel was launched on 11 June 2003, broadcasting live between 16:00 to midnight, Wednesdays to Saturdays. It broadcast live for almost 18 hours a day from 07:45 to 01:30. Price Drop was available on Freeview channel 37, Virgin Media channel 741, Sky channel 654, Freesat channel 801, and WightFibre channel 706. It closed on 17 April 2014, because of Bid Shopping&#x27;s closure.

===Bid Plus===

Bid Plus (formerly known as &quot;Speed Auction TV&quot; until 1 August 2011 and &quot;Speed Auction&quot; until March 2013) was a channel launched on 27 July 2005 and closed on 1 July 2013. The channel launched as &#x27;Speed Auction TV&#x27; featuring rising price auctions lasting around 4 minutes. However, from 26 March 2008, the channel &quot;flipped the arrow&quot; and started selling all its products using a falling price dynamic, matching its sister channels Bid and Price Drop. On 1 August 2011, the channel changed its name to &#x27;Speed Auction&#x27; dropping the &#x27;TV&#x27; from its name. The channel was later renamed again to Bid Plus in March 2013 and lasted until its closure a few months later.

===Pricedropper.co.uk===
Pricedropper.co.uk launched on 25 August 2010 and was Bid Shopping&#x27;s online-only channel, which focuses on fixed-price &#x27;auctions&#x27;, which aim to beat the high street. Pricedropper.co.uk outlived its online sister channel &quot;Dibbing.com&quot;. In March 2013, the website got replaced by the official website for Bid Plus until the channel&#x27;s closure.

===Matinee Movies===
Matinee Movies was a part-time movie channel owned by Sit-Up Ltd. It was then on Sky channel 336 and ran daily from 9 am to 9 pm. The last hour of the channel was occupied by some of Sit-Up&#x27;s shopping auctions, such as Speed Auction TV.

The channel was aimed at families, showing classic and rare black &amp; white British films such as &quot;Love in Pawn&quot; and the Frankie Howerd bequest comedy &quot;A Touch of the Sun&quot;. Films on the channel were introduced by film critic Paul Ross. As an , or at the start of the broadcast day, there were showings of a film magazine programme called &quot;Sprockets&quot; (not to be confused with the SNL sketches with Mike Myers).

In under a year, the channel and EPG slot was sold to Dolphin Television who rebranded it as a 24-hour channel called Movies4Men on 1 February 2006. Sit-Up have no involvement with this channel.

===Bad Movies===
Bad Movies was a part-time movie channel owned by Sit-Up Ltd. It was then on Sky channel 339 and ran daily from 9 pm to 9 am. The first three hours however showed Sit-Up&#x27;s shopping auctions, so Bad Movies content did not actually appear until midnight.

The channel was aimed at a young adult audience, showing a variety of cinematic &quot;turkeys&quot;, though some of the content was increasingly from matinee movies, especially after 5am. Films included &quot;Tomboy&quot; starring Betsy Russell, &quot;Glen and Randa&quot;, &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; and &quot;Revenge of the Cheerleaders&quot; starring David Hasselhoff. The channel also featured introductions by Paul Ross and episodes of Sprockets.

As per Matinee Movies, the channel and EPG slot was also sold to Dolphin Television who rebranded it as a 24-hour channel called ACTIONMAX (later rebranded as Movies4Men 2) on 1 February 2006. Sit-Up have no involvement with this channel.

===Screenshop===

Screenshop was an infomercial-based shopping channel. A deal in July 2004 meant that Vector Direct began to broadcast their presentations exclusively on the channel, this led to the channel being stripped of its identity. In 2005, it began to broadcast under Vector Direct&#x27;s own band &#x27;TV Warehouse&#x27;.

A second channel, Screenshop 2, launched in 2008 and ran until 29 April 2012. It broadcast during Speed Auction&#x27;s downtime of 01:30 to 07:30 each day on Sky channel 680.

Screenshop also broadcast during the hours of 01:30 to 07:45 during Bid Shopping&#x27;s downtime on its other channels, Bid and Price Drop.

<text>Sextus (possibly Gaius) Julius Saturninus (died 280 AD) was a Roman usurper against Emperor Probus.

Julius Saturninus was a Gaul by birth (others have him as a Moor) and was a friend of Probus, who appointed him governor of Syria around 279.

After Probus had left Syria for the Rhine in 280, unruly soldiers and the people of Alexandria pressured a reluctant Saturninus to accept imperial office. Having fled from Egypt, he changed his mind in Palestine and proclaimed himself emperor. Ancient sources conflict on what happened next: the Historia Augusta states that Probus sent men to kill the usurper, while according to an account by Zosimus, before Probus could respond to the threat, Saturninus was dead, killed by his own troops.

<doc id="549272" wikidata="Q1569858" url="?curid=549272" title="Hakaniemi">
<text>Hakaniemi (; ) is an unofficial district of Helsinki, the Finnish capital. It covers most of the neighbourhood of Siltasaari in the district of Kallio. Hakaniemi is located at the sea shore and is separated from the city centre by the Siltavuorensalmi strait and from the district of Linjat by the street Hämeentie. Historically, Hakaniemi was often associated with the working class and workers&#x27; associations. However, the cost of living has risen considerably in recent years and is now on par with that of the rest of central Helsinki.

The main office of the Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), the party offices of the Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) and the Left Alliance, as well as the Helsinki workers&#x27; house Paasitorni are located in Hakaniemi. The May Day march of the working class in Helsinki usually starts at the Hakaniemi market square.

The best-known features of Hakaniemi include a large and lively marketplace, Oriental food stores with a good variety of Asian imported products the headquarters of several trade unions, the headquarters of the Social Democratic Party of Finland and the Left Alliance Party and the Helsinki Hilton hotel. Famous buildings include the round Ympyrätalo building (architects Heikki and Kaija Sirén, 1968) and the Hakaniemi market hall (architect Karl Hård af Segerstad, 1914).

The Hakaniemi market square was built on reclaimed land. It has been the site of a farmers&#x27; market since 1897.

== Location ==
Hakaniemi is located at the southern edge of the district of Kallio. It is separated from Kruununhaka by the Siltavuorensalmi strait, with the bridges Pitkäsilta and the Hakaniemi bridge crossing over it.

The official subdivision list of Helsinki does not contain any subdivision named Hakaniemi, and what exact area Hakaniemi encompasses is ambiguous. As the Hakaniemi area contains reclaimed land, it is no longer recognisable in its original peninsular form. Mostly Hakaniemi is thought of the area of the Hakaniemi market square with its immediate surroundings. This would make it include the eastern part of the neighbourhood of Siltasaari and the southernmost part of the neighbourhood of Linjat; often it is also thought of including the neighbourhood of Merihaka, which belongs to the district of Sörnäinen. The Hakaniemi metro station is located partly in Siltasaari, partly in Linjat. The street Hakaniemenranta starts at Siltaarenkatu and continues to Merihaka, going around it along the sea shore, as a pedestrian street at its easternmost part. The sculpture World peace is located along this coastal street, near a pier offering boat connections to various Helsinki islands such as Vallisaari in the summertime.

Originally Hakaniemi was a peninsula clearly sticking out into the sea, located at the area between the present locations of the market square and Merihaka. It was separated from Siltasaari by a narrow strait running diagonally across the area of the present market square. In the late 18th century there was a pasture for farm animals at the peninsula, called Generalshagen, and the entire peninsula was named &quot;Hagnäs&quot; (Swedish for &quot;pasture cape&quot;) already at the time. The corresponding Finnish name was &quot;Hagnääsi&quot; in the 1880s and &quot;Hakaniemi&quot; since 1909. The peninsula has given its name to the Hakaniemi market hall, the streets of Hakaniemenkatu and Hakaniemenkuja, the Hakaniemi metro station, the Hakaniemi park, the street Hakaniemenranta, the Hakaniemi bridge, the Hakaniemi market square and the street Hakaniemen torikatu.

== History ==
=== Land reclamation ===
The first bridges over the Töölönlahti bay were built in 1651 for the road leading from Vironniemi (Kruununhaka) to Vanhakaupunki. When the bridges were rebuilt in 1832, the islands in the bay were named Iso Siltasaari and Pikku Siltasaari. The bridge from Siltavuori to Iso Siltasaari was called Pitkäsilta and the bridge over Pikku Siltasaari was called Pikkusilta.

Land reclamation in the strait separating Siltasaari from the mainland on its northern and eastern sides, containing the Hakaniemi area at the time, at the present location of the market square, started in 1886. This land reclamation used dredging soil from the Sörnäinen harbour. To stop reclaimed land from flowing into the sea, a dam was built from soil, rocks and spruce trunks. Soon after the reclamation was completed, the dam gave in. As there was plenty of dredging soil available, a new dam was built further away in the bay. In 1891 the Pikkusilta bridge still remained, but it had been left on dry land. The market square area dried up slowly and had to be crossed on duckboards. The land reclamation took a total of eleven years, and market vendors started sales in the area on Christmas 1897.

=== Home of the working class ===

Up to the 19th century Hakaniemi was just a peaceful pasture. The city of Helsinki started to regulate construction to the north of Pitkäsilta since the 1820s. In 1846 the area was divided into villa and industrial lots, which the city leased with long-term contracts. Lands further away were dealt as fields and pastures. In the late 19th century the city of Helsinki started rapidly industrialising and factories were built in the Sörnäinen area. At the same time, increased rents in the city centre drove the working class further away, and Hakaniemi located on the opposite end of the Pitkäsilta bridge soon became a popular place to live in.

Pitkäsilta soon became a symbol of the class difference between the bourgeoisie in the city centre and the proletariat in the north. Hakaniemi, known as the home for many trade unions, was coloured red and many demonstrations were held at the Hakaniemi market square. During the 1906 Sveaborg rebellion the so-called Hakaniemi riot took place at the market square, which has been seen as the first clash between the red and white guards in Finland. The reds later planned a revolution at the so-called &quot;Granite Castle&quot;, the Helsinki workers&#x27; house at Säästöpankinranta. The Finnish Civil War is thought to have started when a red lantern was hoisted on the top of the tower at the workers&#x27; house in the evening of 26 January 1918 as a sign of revolution.

=== Later phases ===

In the 1920s the industry in the area was seen as unfit to the urban image, and the Siltasaari area started to become an extension of the business centre. In 1925 Hakaniemi became a public transport hub as it started serving as a terminus for bus transport. In the early 1930s half of the Helsinki tram lines passed through Hakaniemi. The southern sidetrack of the Sörnäinen harbour rail was used to transport firewood to the Hakaniemi market square, used to heat the houses in the area. A bus terminal was built at the market square in 1963.

After the war, the wooden houses in the area were replaced with multi-storey brick and stone houses, many new businesses and government institutions moved to the area, and the population of forty thousand slowly started to decrease.

To stop the population for decreasing, the neighbourhood of Merihaka, a &quot;concrete neighbourhood&quot; similar to Itä-Pasila was built next to Hakaniemi. The population still kept on decreasing, and by the 1980s, the entire district of Kallio only had twenty thousand inhabitants.

== Projects ==
The Crown Bridges project was started in 2016, including a ten-kilometre-long tram connection and three new bridges between the city centre, Hakaniemi and Yliskylä. A temporary terminus will be built between Laajasalo and Hakaniemi, and tram traffic is expected to start in 2027.

Many new buildings are planned in the area around Hakaniemenranta, Merihaka and Sörnäisten rantatie. The Norwegian Arthur Burchardt would like to build a new hotel near the World peace sculpture. A new bridge will be built next to the deteriorated Hakaniemi bridge, after which the old bridge will be dismantled.

A new railway station is planned next to the Hakaniemi metro station as part of the Helsinki City Rail Loop. A new service yard is being built underneath the market hall, and a new parking garage is being planned underneath the market square.

<text>Töölö (; , formerly spelled &quot;Thölö&quot;) is the collective name for the neighbourhoods Etu-Töölö () and Taka-Töölö () in Helsinki, Finland. The neighbourhoods are located next to the city centre, occupying the western side of the Helsinki Peninsula.

Etu-Töölö, the southern neighbourhood, borders Kamppi and is the location of the Finnish Parliament House. Taka-Töölö, the northern neighbourhood, borders Meilahti and Laakso, and is the location of the Helsinki University Central Hospital. Contrary to popular belief, Töölö is no longer an official name of any district or neighbourhood in Helsinki; in 1959 Töölö was divided into Etu-Töölö and Taka-Töölö.

==Overview==

Töölö was built in its present form, for the most part, in the period between 1900–1930 during an era of rapid expansion with the aim to provide appropriate accommodation to a growing bourgeoise population. It was the site of the first ever town planning competition in Finland in 1898–1900. Three entries were lifted out for recognition; first prize was awarded to architect Gustaf Nyström (together with engineer Herman Norrmén), second prize to architect Lars Sonck, and third prize to a joint entry by Sonck together with architects Bertil Jung and Valter Thomé. Nyström&#x27;s scheme represented classicism with wide main streets and imposing public buildings arranged in symmetrical axial compositions, and the other two entries following two picturesque theories of town planning proposed at that time by Viennese city planner Camillo Sitte, with the street network adapted to the rocky terrain and with picturesque compositions. Undecided what course of action to take, however, the City Council asked the prize-winners to submit new proposals. When this led to further stalemate Nyström and Sonck were commissioned to work together on the final plan combining Nyström&#x27;s spacious street network and elements of Sonck&#x27;s Sittesque details. The final plan (1906) under the direction of Jung, made the scheme more uniform, while the architecture is seen as typical of the Nordic Classicism style. A typical street in the plan is that of Museokatu, with tall lines of buildings in a classical style along a curving street line. A still wider (24 metres) new tree-lined boulevard was that of Helsinginkatu, driven through the working-class district of Kallio, first outlined in 1887 by Sonck, but with further input from Nyström, and completed in around 1923. However, despite these wide streets there are also several Sitte-inspired picturesque streets and squares, most notably Temppeliaukio square (in the centre of which is the &quot;church in the rock&quot;).

Töölö has always been the most respected as a place to live, but the prices of apartments are high, especially in Etu-Töölö. In Töölö, the marketing times for apartments are clearly shorter and the prices per square meter are therefore higher than in the rest of Helsinki on average, which speaks of abundant demand. A square of living in Töölö costs about €8,000, which is close to the price level of the second most popular district, Lauttasaari, but clearly less than in Ullanlinna, where a square of living costs closer to €10,000.

Töölö is also known for its functionalist architecture, notably around Taka-Töölö. There are many parks, including Hesperia Park on the Töölö Bay and also Sibelius Park, named after composer Jean Sibelius and containing a monument in his name. Töölö also has a vibrant cultural life, being the location of the Finnish National Opera, the National Museum of Finland, Kunsthalle Helsinki, the Zoological Museum, Töölö Library, and many small galleries and bookstores. With the Olympic Stadium, Sonera Stadium, the Sports Hall and the Ice Hall, all within walking distance from each other, Taka-Töölö is also a significant neighbourhood for sport life in Helsinki.

<doc id="549281" wikidata="Q159438" url="?curid=549281" title="Hero City (Soviet Union)">
<text>Hero City is a Soviet honorary title awarded for outstanding heroism during World War II (the Eastern Front is known in most countries of the former Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War). It was awarded to twelve cities of the Soviet Union, today located in Belarus (1 city), Russia (7 cities), and Ukraine (4 cities). Brest Fortress in Belarus was awarded the equivalent title of Hero Fortress. This symbolic distinction for a city corresponds to the individual distinction &quot;Hero of the Soviet Union&quot;.

According to the statute, the hero city was issued the Order of Lenin, the Gold Star medal, and the certificate of the heroic deed (&quot;gramota&quot; or &quot;hramota&quot;) from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Also, the corresponding obelisk was installed in the city.

==History==
The usage of the term &quot;hero city&quot; is dated to articles in &quot;Pravda&quot; as early as in 1942. The first official usage of the title is dated by May 1, 1945, when Joseph Stalin issued his Supreme Commander Order No. 20 commanding to fire salutes in &quot;hero cities Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol, and Odessa.&quot;

On June 22, 1961 (the 20th anniversary of the beginning of the Great Patriotic War) the term &quot;Hero City&quot; was applied to Kiev in the &quot;ukases&quot; that awarded Kiev the Order of Lenin and introduced the Medal &quot;For the Defence of Kiev&quot;.

The statute of the title was officially introduced on May 8, 1965, by the &quot;ukase&quot; of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of USSR, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War. The same day ukases were issued about awarding the cities mentioned above: Leningrad (Saint Petersburg), Volgograd (former Stalingrad), Kiev, Sevastopol, and Odessa. Additionally, Moscow was declared Hero City and Brest declared &quot;Hero Fortress&quot;.

Subsequent awards were issued as follows:
*September 14, 1973: Kerch and Novorossiysk.

In 1988 the issuance of the award was officially discontinued.

=== Suggestions for expanding the list ===
The suggestion was first proposed by the Azerbaijani ambassador to Russia Polad Bülbüloğlu in an interview in February 2015. In the interview, he said that Baku getting the status of Hero City &quot;would be quite fair&quot; and that it &quot;would be a respect to the people who lost their lives working day and night&quot; along with being an &quot;important socio-political act&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Vestnik Kavkaza&quot;, historian Efim Pivovar recommended that the Russian Federation not assign the city this title and instead support an initiative through the Commonwealth of Independent States to award Baku, as well as cities like Tashkent, with this title. In January 2020, Russian Deputy Dmitry Savelyev became one of the first sitting members of parliament to publicly support this.

==Hero Cities list==
===Brest Fortress===
The fortress in Brest, Belarus was awarded the title Hero Fortress in 1965. It was located right on the recently established border between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany drawn in the secret appendix to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. As such, the fortress had little warning when the Axis invaded on June 22, 1941, and became the site of the first major fighting between Soviet frontier guards and the invading German forces of Army Group Centre.

German artillery heavily shelled the fortress; the subsequent attempt to quickly take it with infantry failed, however, and the Germans started a lengthy siege. The Brest garrison, although cut off from reinforcements and having run out of food, water and ammunition, fought and counter-attacked until the very last minute. The Germans deployed tanks, tear gas and flame throwers. After the Germans had taken most of the ruined fortifications, taking heavy casualties, fighting continued underground.

The fighting ended only on June 29. The actual front had by then already moved hundreds of kilometres further east. Even after the fortress was officially taken, the few surviving defenders continued to hide in the basements and to harass the Germans for several months.

===Leningrad===
The city of Leningrad, now known as Saint Petersburg, saw what is regarded as one of the greatest human tragedies of the entire war. Leningrad, one of the cities with a large amount of classical and baroque architecture on the Baltic Sea, was a city with a pre-war population of three million inhabitants. By August 1941, the Germans had reached the city&#x27;s southern outskirts. Finnish forces had meanwhile recaptured the Karelian Isthmus northwest of the city, which they had lost after the Winter War in 1940.

The city was completely cut off from all land access on September 8, 1941. As the Gulf of Finland was blocked as well, Leningrad&#x27;s only contact with the outer world was a vulnerable waterway across Lake Ladoga (Road of Life), as Finnish command didn&#x27;t agree to German requests to advance beyond the River Svir and to conquer the rest of the Lake&#x27;s coastline. Since taking the city seemed too costly to the Germans, in the light of bitter Soviet resistance, they instead began the Siege of Leningrad to starve the city to death. Soon, electricity, water and heating for civilian housing had to be shut down. All public transportation stopped in 1941–42 winter, but in 1942 city tramcars were relaunched (trolleys and buses were inoperable until the end of the war).

Thousands of Leningrad citizens froze or starved to death in the first winter of the siege alone, dying at home in their beds or collapsing from exhaustion in the streets. Meanwhile, German artillery continued to bombard the city. Although the siege lasted for 872 days, the city did not surrender. When Lake Ladoga froze in the winter, the Road of Life was opened to the Soviet-held southern shore, with a long trail of trucks bringing food and supplies to the besieged city and evacuating citizens on their way back. Both the food and the civilian transports were constantly attacked by the Germans with artillery shelling and air raids.

When Soviet forces eventually lifted the siege in January 1944, over one million inhabitants of Leningrad had died from starvation, exposure and German shelling. 300,000 soldiers had perished in the defence and relief of Leningrad. Leningrad was awarded the title Hero City in 1965, being the first city to receive that distinction.

===Volgograd (Stalingrad)===

Volgograd is the present-day name of the city of Stalingrad. The defence of Stalingrad from July to November 1942, the counter-offensive of November 19, 1942, that trapped the Axis forces in and around the ruined city, and the German surrender on February 2, 1943, marked the turning point of the European Theatre of World War II. The intensity and sheer scale of the Battle of Stalingrad illustrate the ferocity of the German-Soviet War. Heavy German bombardment, killing thousands of civilians, had turned the city into a landscape of ruins. Workers of the city&#x27;s weapons factories started personally handing over arms and ammunition to the defending soldiers as the Germans closed in, and eventually continued the fight themselves. Ever more Soviet troops were shipped into the city across the Volga River under enemy fire. German superiority in tanks became useless in the rubble of urban warfare. Fierce man-to-man fighting in streets, buildings and staircases continued for months. The Red Army moved its strategic reserve from Moscow to the lower Volga and transferred all available aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad area. The Germans eventually lost a quarter of their total forces deployed on the Eastern Front, and never fully recovered from the defeat. The total casualties on both sides are estimated at nearly 2 million, within a period of 200 days. Volgograd was awarded the title Hero City in 1965.

===Odessa===
In early August 1941, the Black Sea port of Odessa, located in present-day Ukraine, was attacked and besieged by Romanian forces fighting alongside their German allies. The fierce battle in defense of the city lasted until October 16, when the remaining Soviet troops, as well as 15,000 civilians were evacuated by sea. Partisan fighting continued, however, in the city&#x27;s catacombs. Odessa was awarded the title Hero City in 1965.

===Sevastopol===
The Soviet Black Sea port of Sevastopol was a heavily defended fortress on the Crimean peninsula. German and Romanian troops had advanced to the outskirts of the city from the north and launched their attack on October 30, 1941. Having failed to take the city, Axis forces began a siege and heavy bombardment, with such unusual pieces of ordnance as the Mörser Karl self-propelled mortar, and the gigantic Schwerer Gustav railroad cannon. A second Axis offensive against the city, launched in December 1941, failed as well, as the Soviet army and navy forces continued to fight fiercely. Eventually the city was taken in June 1942. It was liberated in bloody fighting in May 1944. Sevastopol was awarded the title Hero City in 1965.

===Moscow===
At the gates of the Soviet capital, the German invaders suffered their first defeat in 1941. The advance of the German Army Group Centre came to a halt in late November 1941, at the outskirts of Moscow itself. The Soviet Government had by then been evacuated, yet Joseph Stalin remained in the city. The population helped build defensive positions in the streets. The underground metro stations provided shelter during German air raids.

General Georgy Zhukov, who assumed command of the city&#x27;s defence, largely left close combat tactics to the local commanders on the city&#x27;s approaches, and focused on concentrating fresh troops from Siberia for an eventual counter-attack. The Soviet counter-offensive was launched on December 5 and 6, 1941. In the freezing cold of an unusually harsh winter, Soviet forces, including well-equipped ski battalions, drove the exhausted Germans back out of reach of Moscow and consolidated their positions on January 7, 1942. The victory in the battle provided an important boost in morale for the Soviet population. Moscow was awarded the title Hero City in 1965.

===Kiev===
The capital of present-day Ukraine became the site of the largest encirclement battle in the summer of 1941. When the Germans commenced their offensive on July 7, Soviet forces concentrated in the Kiev area were ordered to stand fast, and a breakout was prohibited. Defence of the pocket was fierce. Thousands of civilians volunteered to help defend the city. Eventually Kiev was taken on September 19. Over 600,000 Soviet soldiers were taken captive when the pocket was cleared. The prolonged resistance effectively disrupted the German plans of &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;. However, in military terms, the battle was a great victory for the German Army and a disaster for the Soviets. It had a huge effect on morale, and Adolf Hitler praised the victory as the greatest battle in history.

During the German occupation of Kiev, hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed or deported for forced labour. Kiev again became a battlefield when advancing Soviet forces pushed the Germans back West, liberating the city on November 6, 1943. Kiev was awarded the title Hero City in 1965.

===Novorossiysk===
The city of Novorossiysk on the eastern coast of the Black Sea provided a stronghold against the German summer offensive of 1942. Intense fighting in and around the city lasted from August until it was captured by the Germans in mid-September 1942. The Soviets however retained possession of the eastern part of the bay, which prevented the Germans from using the port for supply shipments. Novorossiysk was awarded the title Hero City in 1973.

===Kerch===

Kerch, a port city in the East of the Crimean peninsula, formed a bridgehead at the strait dividing Crimea from the Southern Russian mainland. After fierce fighting, it was taken by the Germans in November 1941. On December 30, 1941, the Soviets recaptured the city in a naval landing operation. In May 1942 the Germans occupied the city again, yet Soviet partisan forces held out in the cliffs near the city until October 1942. On October 31, 1943, another Soviet naval landing was launched. The largely ruined city was finally liberated on April 11, 1944. Kerch was awarded the title Hero City in 1973.

===Minsk===
The city of Minsk, capital of present-day Belarus, was encircled by advancing German forces in late June 1941. Trapped in a vast pocket, the Soviets defended their positions desperately. Their resistance was broken on July 9, with over 300,000 Soviet soldiers taken captive. During the following three-year occupation, the Germans killed about 400,000 civilians in and around the city. The Minsk area became a centre for the Soviet partisan activity behind enemy lines. Minsk was awarded the title Hero City in 1974.

===Tula===
Tula, a historical Russian city with important military industry south of Moscow, became the target of a German offensive to break Soviet resistance in the Moscow area between October 24 and December 5, 1941. The heavily fortified city held out, however, and secured the Southern flank during the Soviet defence of Moscow and the subsequent counter-offensive. Tula was awarded the title Hero City in 1976.

===Murmansk===
The city of Murmansk, located on the Kola Peninsula close to the Norwegian and Finnish borders, was a strategically important sea port and industrial city. It was the only Soviet port on the northern coast that did not freeze in the winter, and was vital for the transport of supplies to the South. German forces, including 800 Finns under German command, launched an offensive against Murmansk on June 29, 1941. More than 180,000 grenades and inflammable shells were fired on the city itself. Fierce Soviet resistance in the tundra and several Soviet counter-attacks made an Axis breakthrough impossible, however. Axis forces discontinued their attacks in late October 1941, having failed to take Murmansk or to cut off the Karelian railway line. Murmansk was awarded the title Hero City in 1985.

===Smolensk===

Located on the approaches to Moscow, the city of Smolensk saw fierce fighting in the summer of 1941. German armoured divisions of Army Group Centre began an offensive on July 10, 1941, to encircle Soviet forces in the Smolensk area. Soviet resistance was strong, and several counter-attacks were conducted. The Soviets even managed to temporarily break the German encirclement and to evacuate troops out of the pocket. The battle ended in early September. The bitter fighting had considerably delayed the overall German advance toward Moscow, so that defence lines further east could be strengthened. Smolensk was awarded the title Hero City in 1985.

===Russia===
On April 5, 2005, the State Duma of Russian Federation passed the law in the first reading about the introduction of the honorary title &quot;City of Military Glory&quot; (). Potential candidates are places of fierce battles: Oryol, Rzhev, Yelnya, Voronezh, Vyazma, and others. It has been awarded to 45 cities in Russia.

In 2020, the title of &quot;City of Labour Valour&quot; was established, honouring the cities who had a record of uninterrupted production of military and civilian products at industrial enterprises during the Second World War. Twenty cities currently hold the title.

==== Russian-supported republics ====
In Georgia, the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have hero cities in their nation, with those cities being given their title based on their perceived steadfast pushback against the Georgian military during their respective conflicts (War in Abkhazia from 1992 to 1993 and the Russo-Georgian War on 2008). In Abkhazia, the cities of Tkvarcheli and Gudauta were awarded the title of Hero of Abkhazia in with the status of a Hero City. On November 23, 2009, by the Decree of the President of South Ossetia, the capital of Tskhinvali was awarded the title for its &quot;courage, endurance and heroism shown by the people and defenders of the city&quot; during the Battle of Tskhinvali. The decree on conferring the award was read at a ceremony dedicated to the Day of Courage and National Unity.

<text>Prince Gustav of Vasa, Count of Itterburg (; 9 November 1799 – 4 August/5 August 1877), born Crown Prince of Sweden, was the son of King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden and Queen Frederica. His Austrian princely title (from 1829) was actually spelled &quot;Wasa&quot;.

==Life and career==
After his birth at Stockholm at Stockholm, he was raised under the supervision of the royal governesses Hedvig Ulrika De la Gardie and Charlotte Stierneld in succession.

When he was ten years old, his father was deposed by the Coup of 1809 and the family was forced into exile. The Gustavian party tried to get him accepted as crown prince in 1809 and 1810, but were unsuccessful. Queen Charlotte, wife of the new king, was one of the leading figures of the Gustavian Party, and often visited ex-queen Frederica in her house arrest and worked for prince Gustav to be acknowledged as heir to the throne. She wrote of this issue in her diaries: during a dinner, General Georg Adlersparre told her that Jean Baptiste Bernadotte had asked whether she had any issue, and was interested when he found she had not. She said that the throne already had an heir in the deposed King&#x27;s son. Adlersparre became upset and expressed the opinion of his party that none of the instigators of the coup would accept this as they feared that the boy would take revenge against them when he became King, and that they would go as far as take up the old rumour that the deposed King was, in fact, illegitimate and the son of Queen Sophia Magdalena and Count Adolf Fredrik Munck af Fulkila to prevent this.

Between the time after the coup and before the royal family left Sweden, they were held under house arrest. During that period, Queen Charlotte described him in her famous diary as an obedient and dutiful child with a great ability to learn. He was not haughty as his younger sister Princess Sophie, but humble. Rather, he seemed too quiet and too careful for his age. When Princess Sophie asked him why their father was no longer King, he told her that it was best not to talk about it. He asked no questions and did not appear to miss his father. After he was told that his father had been deposed, he acted embarrassed towards his mother. However, when she told him that he too had lost his position as heir, he cried and embraced her without a word. The announcement gave him much relief and happiness.

In 1816, he assumed the title of Count of Itterburg. He served as an officer to the Habsburgs of Austria, and in 1829, Emperor Francis I created him Prince of Vasa (). During the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829) there was some talk of Gustav becoming its first king, but this never materialized. He was made a Field Marshal-Lieutenant in the Austrian Army in 1836.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1828, he became engaged to Princess Marianne of the Netherlands, but political pressure forced an end to any wedding plans. On 9 November 1830, he married in Karlsruhe his first cousin Princess Louise Amelie of Baden (5 June 1811 in Schwetzingen – 19 July 1854 in Karlsruhe). They divorced in 1843. A son, Louis, was born in 1832 but died shortly after birth. Their daughter, Princess Carola, married the Catholic Albert, King of Saxony, but they had no issue.

Gustaf died on 5 August 1877 at Pillnitz. In 1884, his (and his infant son&#x27;s) remains were moved to Stockholm, to be buried beside his father.

<text>Romanzo d&#x27;appendìce (Italian for &quot;feuilleton&quot;) was a popular genre in literature, which originated in England and France, in the second half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th.

This literary genre is characterised by the existence of many and often recurring characters, and by many cliffhangers at the end of a chapter, to ensure sales of the next episode. This is a clear case of form influencing content: these novels were published in episodes in newspapers and could in a certain sense be compared to modern soap opera. Ponson du Terrail, Eugene Sue, Maurice Leblanc, Gustave Le Rouge and Michel Zévaco were among the numerous authors which contributed to the genre.

Feuilleton is used in current language to indicate a quite improbable story.</text><links>

<doc id="549297" wikidata="Q57616" url="?curid=549297" title="Maximilian von Weichs">
<text>Maximilian Maria Joseph Karl Gabriel Lamoral Reichsfreiherr von und zu Weichs an der Glonn (12 November 1881 – 27 September 1954) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field marshal) in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; of Nazi Germany during World War II. 

Born into an aristocratic family, Weichs joined the Bavarian cavalry in 1900 and fought in the First World War. At the outbreak of the Second World War he commanded the XIII Corps in the invasion of Poland. He later commanded the 2nd Army during the invasions of France, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. 

In August 1942 during Case Blue, the German offensive in southern Russia, he was appointed commander of Army Group B. In 1944, Weichs commanded Army Group F in the Balkans overseeing the German retreat from Greece and most of Yugoslavia. During the Nuremberg Trials, Weichs was implicated in war crimes committed in the Balkans, and was scheduled to take part in the US Army&#x27;s Hostages Trial. He was removed from the proceeding for &quot;medical reasons&quot; without having been judged or sentenced.

==Early life and career==
===World War I===
Born in 1881 into an aristocratic family, Maximilian von Weichs entered the Bavarian cavalry in 1900 and participated in World War I as a staff officer. After the war he remained in the newly created &quot;Reichswehr&quot; where he worked at a number of General Staff positions.

===Inter-war years===

Transferred from the 3rd Cavalry Division to command Germany&#x27;s 1st Panzer Division upon its formation in October 1935, he led the unit in maneuvers that impressed Army Commander-in-Chief Werner von Fritsch. Weichs&#x27; aristocratic and cavalry credentials demonstrated the continuing influence of these military elites in Germany&#x27;s modernizing force. In October 1937, he became the commander of the XIII Army Corps that later served in the 1938 German annexation of the Sudetenland.

==World War II==
To prepare for the German invasion of Poland beginning World War II in 1939, Weichs was appointed head of his own Army Corps &quot;Weichs&quot;. 
After the Polish surrender, he was made Commander-in-Chief of the 2nd Army, a part of Gerd von Rundstedt&#x27;s Army Group A in the West. After the Battle of France, he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross and promoted to &quot;Generaloberst&quot;. Leading his army, Weichs later took part in the Balkans Campaign, and in preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was assigned to lead the 2nd Army as a part of Fedor von Bock’s Army Group Centre. He led the 2nd Army in 1941 through the Battle of Kiev, the Battle of Smolensk, and then on to Vyazma and Bryansk.
In 1942, for Fall Blau, Weichs was assigned to lead the newly created Army Group B. Army Group B was composed of Salmuth&#x27;s 2nd Army, Hoth’s 4th Panzer Army, and Paulus&#x27;s 6th Army. In addition to the German armies, Army Group B included the 2nd Hungarian Army, 8th Italian Army, the Third and the Fourth Romanian Armies. The 6th Army was assigned to take the city of Stalingrad and cover approximately 800 km of front.

The Soviet Operation Uranus broke through the Romanian armies on his flanks, cutting off the 6th Army inside Stalingrad. Suggesting retreat, Weichs fell out of Hitler’s favor. Consequently, parts of Army Group B were taken away from the command of Weichs and incorporated into a new &quot;Army Group Don&quot;, led by Erich von Manstein. Later in February, the remaining part merged with the Don Group into a newly reinstated Army Group South, also led by Manstein. Weichs was relieved of command.

Weichs was promoted to &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; on 1 February 1943. In August 1943, Weichs was appointed commander of Army Group F in the Balkans directing operations against local partisan groups. From August 1943, Weichs was also OB Südost, commander-in-chief of German-occupied Greece and the Balkans (Yugoslavia, Albania and Thrace). His headquarters were first in Belgrade and, from 5 October 1944, in Vukovar. In April 1944, Weichs was appointed the commander of all German troops in Hungary. In late 1944, he oversaw the German retreat from Greece and most of Yugoslavia.

== Post-war years ==

Weichs retired from his military career on 25 March 1945, and was arrested by American troops in May. During the Nuremberg Trials, Weichs was said to be implicated in war crimes committed while suppressing the partisans. He was removed from the US Army&#x27;s Hostages Trial for medical reasons without having been judged or sentenced.

Weichs died on 27 September 1954 in Bonn, West Germany at the age of 72.

<text>A reference beam is a laser beam used to read and write holograms. It is one of two laser beams used to create a hologram. In order to read a hologram out, some aspects of the reference beam (namely its angle of incidence, beam profile and wavelength) must be reproduced exactly as when it was used to write the hologram. As a result, usually reference beams are Gaussian beams or spherical wave beams (beams that radiate from a single point) which are fairly easy to reproduce.

A hologram can be recorded with a single beam, if the beam is spread out enough so that it illuminates both the object and the recording plate (and light scatters off the object onto the plate). However, that is completely equivalent to having separate object and reference beams.

The other beam used to write a hologram is the signal beam or object beam.

<text>A signal beam or object beam is one of at least two laser beams used to write holograms. The signal beam is the beam that carries the information to be stored in the hologram. In the case of a holographic picture, this beam is reflected off the object being recorded, into the media. In the case of holographic data storage, the beam has some kind information encoded into it (for instance, it can be sent through a transparency or a spatial light modulator).

<doc id="549305" wikidata="Q1105717" url="?curid=549305" title="Caucones">
<text>The Caucones ( &quot;Kaukônes&quot;) were an autochthonous tribe of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), who later migrated to parts of the Greek mainland (Arcadia, Triphylian Pylos and Elis). 

== Origin and early history ==

The phonology of the name Caucones has been taken as evidence for an origin in the Caucasus Mountains. It is also suggested that they are related to the Late Bronze Age &quot;Kaskians&quot;, who Hittite tablets locate along the southern shore of the Black Sea. According to Herodotus and other classical era writers, the Caucones were among the tribes displaced or absorbed by the Bithynians, who had migrated from Thrace.

==In myth and literature ==

The &quot;Iliad&quot; lists the Caucones among the Trojan allies. In Book X, the Trojan herald Dolon describes their homeland as &quot;towards the sea&quot; and mentions them alongside the Carians, Paionians, Leleges, and Pelasgians. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (3.366), Athena tells Nestor at Pylos that she will &quot;go to the Caucones, where there&#x27;s an old debt still owing me, not a small amount.&quot; This allusion may refer to a subgroup of Caucones who had migrated to mainland Greece, as reported by Strabo.

Other references to the Caucones in epic tradition may have been attempts to recognize the Caucones as deserving a place in the Neleiad kingdom in southwestern Greece. Efforts were made, we are told by Pausanias (4.1.5). to &#x27;historicize&#x27; &quot;Kaukon&quot; as the early ancestor of the Athenian &quot;genos&quot; &quot;Lykomidai&quot; around 480 BC by inventing a grandson of an earth-born Phlyus named &quot;Kaukon&quot; who taught the Eleusinian Mysteries to a royal queen Messene. His name was &quot;Kaukon&quot;, a teacher of religious rites.

Their penetration beyond Arcadia (Strabo 7.7.1–2) and their claims to be sons of Lycaon or Lycos (Apollodorus, &quot;Library&quot; 3.8.1) explains their enduring presence over time in literature. Pausanias&#x27; description of the carved figure of Caucon holding a lyre atop his tomb speaks to their tribal poetic literacy. Several scholars believed Pylian Caucones (Hdt. 4.148, 1.147, 5.65) brought Neleid legends and Nestor&#x27;s polemic exhortations to Colophon. Mimnermus (fr. 9, 14–15, Strabo 14.1.3–4) their ancestor extended the traditional royal &quot;we&quot; of Homeric Nestor in his words of inspiration to Smyrnaeans fighting Lydian Gyges in the Hermus plain (Paus. 4.21.2, quoted by Theoclus, Paus. 5.8.7, 9.29.4).

== Greek accounts == 

Strabo (8.3.14–15) in discussing Triphylian Pylos lists Caucones once inhabiting Lepreion as does Pausanias (5.5.5), a settlement that may have had custody over Hades-Demeter shrines at Mt. Minthe that grew mint used for the &quot;kukeiôn&quot; at Eleusis (Homer, &quot;Hymn to Demeter&quot; 209: &quot;glêkhôni&quot;). These Caucones enter history with their expulsion (Hdt.4.148) and dispersion to Athens (Paus. 2.18.7–8, 7.2.1–5) and Ionian Miletos (Hdt. 1.146-7), after contributing to the spread of the Eleusinian Great Goddesses into Messenia and Thebes (Paus.4.1.5–9), Ephesos and Kolophon (Strabo 14.1.3). With these passages Pausanias affirms Herodotus (2.51) on the spread of Hermes and a cult of &quot;Kabeiroi&quot; throughout Attika under Hipparchus between 528–514 BC employing inscribed square-cut figures of Hermes in marble as road markers (Plato, &quot;Hipparchus&quot; 228b–229b). A Caucon priest Methapus had done much the same at Thebes. The Milesian Caucones, according to Herodotus (1.147), possessed ancestry from Pylian Codrus, son of Melanthos, the very same genealogy Herodotus (5.65) assigns to the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos. Strabo (12.3.5) reported Caucones once inhabiting the southern Black Sea coast from Heraclea Pontica (modern Karadeniz Ereğli) to Carambis promontory at Teion, on the Parthenios River, their likely Homeric geography (&quot;Iliad&quot; 20.328–9).

<text>Boronia is a genus of about 160 species of flowering plants in the citrus family Rutaceae. Most are endemic to Australia with a few species in New Caledonia, which were previously placed in the genus &quot;Boronella&quot;. They occur in all Australian states but the genus is under review and a number of species are yet to be described or have the description published. Boronias are similar to familiar plants in the genera &quot;Zieria&quot;, &quot;Eriostemon&quot; and &quot;Correa&quot; but can be distinguished from them by the number of petals or stamens. Some species have a distinctive fragrance and are popular garden plants.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Boronia&quot; are nearly always shrubs although a very small number occur as herbs or as small trees. The leaves are usually arranged in opposite pairs and may be simple leaves or compound leaves with up to nineteen or more leaflets, in either a pinnate or bipinnate arrangement. The flowers are arranged in groups in the leaf s or on the ends of the branches and have both male and female parts. There are usually four separate sepals, usually four separate petals and generally eight stamens. (In &quot;Zieria&quot; there are only four stamens, &quot;Eriostemon&quot; species have five petals and in &quot;Correa&quot; the petals are joined to form a bell-shaped tube.) There are four carpels with their styles fused and there are two ovules in each carpel.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus &quot;Boronia&quot; was first formally described in 1798 by James Edward Smith and the description was published in &quot;Tracts Relating to Natural History&quot;. The name &quot;Boronia&quot; honours Francesco Borone (1769 - 1794), Italian naturalist and plant collector, who assisted John Sibthorp in Greece and Turkey, Adam Afzelius in Sierra Leone and James Edward Smith during his European tour in 1787.

Boronia, an outer suburb of Melbourne in Australia was named after a boronia found growing in the area.

==Distribution and habitat==
Boronias are found in all states and mainland territories of Australia and generally grow in open forests or woodlands, only rarely in rainforests or arid areas.

==Use in horticulture==
Boronias, especially &quot;B. megastigma&quot;, are known for their perfumed flowers. Most are regarded as desirable specimens in the garden, however, many are difficult to grow in cultivation. All species require excellent drainage and part shade.

<doc id="549311" wikidata="Q1753343" url="?curid=549311" title="The Laramie Project">
<text>The Laramie Project is a 2000 American play by Moisés Kaufman and members of the Tectonic Theater Project (specifically, Leigh Fondakowski, writer-director; Stephen Belber, Greg Pierotti, Barbara Pitts, Stephen Wangh, Amanda Gronich, Sara Lambert, John McAdams, Maude Mitchell, Andy Paris, and Kelli Simpkins) about the reaction to the 1998 murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming. The murder was denounced as a hate crime and brought attention to the lack of hate crime laws in various states, including Wyoming.

An example of verbatim theatre, the play draws on hundreds of interviews conducted by the theatre company with inhabitants of the town, company members&#x27; own journal entries, and published news reports. It is divided into three acts, and eight actors portray more than sixty characters in a series of short scenes.

==Performances==
&quot;The Laramie Project&quot; premiered at The Ricketson Theatre by the Denver Center Theatre Company (Denver) (part of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts) in February 2000. It was next performed in the Union Square Theatre in New York City before a November 2002 performance in Laramie, Wyoming. The play has also been performed by high schools, colleges, and community theaters across the country. It has been produced at professional playhouses in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.

Many of the performances in the United States have been picketed by followers of Fred Phelps from the Westboro Baptist Church. They are portrayed in the play picketing Matthew Shepard&#x27;s funeral as they did in real life. 

The play has been produced worldwide in the years since its premiere. But in 2009 it still generated controversy in Colorado and Las Vegas, Nevada, where some parents tried to block a production.

The holder of the royalties/rights to &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; is Dramatists Play Service, Inc. The Matthew Shepard Foundation provides help and resources for those wishing to produce &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; or &quot;The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later&quot;. The Foundation&#x27;s Laramie Project Specialist can help with media, historical context, creative consulting, and other resources and services at no charge to non-profit theatres and educational and religious institutions. The Foundation can also help those who wish to engage their communities in a conversation about how to erase hate in the world.

==Actors==
Notable actors/actresses who have performed in &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; include Van Hansis, Mary Beth Peil, Jenna Ushkowitz, Laura Linney, Joshua Jackson, Stephanie March, Peter Hermann, Peter Fonda, Camryn Manheim, Daniel de Weldon, Cyndi Lauper, Clea DuVall, Christina Ricci, Judith Light, Terry Kinney, Frances Sternhagen, Brian Kerwin, Robert Desiderio, Chad Allen, Stockard Channing, Darren Criss, Andrew Garfield, Amy Madigan.

==Combating homophobia==

&quot;The Laramie Project&quot; is often used as a method to teach about prejudice and tolerance in personal, social, and health education and citizenship in schools, and it has also been used in the UK as a General Certificate of Secondary Education text for English literature.

The play has also inspired grassroots efforts to combat homophobia. After seeing the play, New Jersey resident Dean Walton was inspired to donate more than 500 books and other media to the University of Wyoming&#x27;s Rainbow Resource Center. Today, that campus office houses the largest LGBTQ library in the state of Wyoming.

==Film==

As a result of the play&#x27;s success, HBO commissioned a 2002 film of &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;, also written and directed by Kaufman.

==Return to Laramie==

Ten years after Shepard&#x27;s murder, members of Tectonic Theater Project returned to Laramie to conduct follow-up interviews with residents featured in the play. Those interviews were the basis of a companion piece, entitled &quot;The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later&quot;. The play debuted as a reading at nearly 150 theatres across the US and internationally on October 12, 2009 – the 11th anniversary of Matthew Shepard&#x27;s death. Many of the openings were linked by webcam to New York City, where Judy Shepard, Matthew&#x27;s mother, and the play&#x27;s producers and writers gave an opening speech, followed by an address by actress Glenn Close. Daniel DeWeldon played Aaron McKinney opposite Barbara Bain in the Los Angeles production at Grand Performances, directed by Michael Arabian.

&quot;The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later&quot; was presented for the first time in rep with &quot;The Laramie Project&quot; at the BAM Harvey Theater from February 12–24, 2013 as part of an event titled &quot;The Laramie Project Cycle&quot;. Directed by Kaufman and Leigh Fondakowski, the production featured much of the original cast reprising their roles.

<doc id="549318" wikidata="Q217494" url="?curid=549318" title="Macaroni penguin">
<text>The macaroni penguin (Eudyptes chrysolophus) is a species of penguin found from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula. One of six species of crested penguin, it is very closely related to the royal penguin, and some authorities consider the two to be a single species. It bears a distinctive yellow crest on its forehead. Its face and upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts. Adults weigh on average and are in length. The male and female are similar in appearance; the male is slightly larger and stronger with a larger bill. Like all penguins, it is flightless, with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle.

Its diet consists of a variety of crustaceans, mainly krill, as well as small fish and cephalopods; the species consumes more marine life annually than any other species of seabird. These birds moult once a year, spending about three to four weeks ashore, before returning to the sea. Numbering up to 100,000 individuals, the breeding colonies of the macaroni penguin are among the largest and densest of all penguin species. After spending the summer breeding, penguins disperse into the oceans for six months; a 2009 study found that macaroni penguins from Kerguelen travelled over in the central Indian Ocean. 

With about 18 million individuals, the macaroni penguin is the most numerous penguin species. Widespread declines in populations have been recorded since the mid-1970s and their conservation status classification is vulnerable.

==Taxonomy==
The macaroni penguin was described from the Falkland Islands in 1837 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt. It is one of six or so species in the genus &quot;Eudyptes&quot;, collectively known as crested penguins. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek words &quot;eu&quot; &quot;good&quot;, and &quot;dyptes&quot; &quot;diver&quot;. The specific name &quot;chrysolophus&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;chryse&quot; &quot;golden&quot;, and &quot;lophos&quot; &quot;crest&quot;.

The common name was recorded from the early 19th century in the Falkland Islands. English sailors apparently named the species for its conspicuous yellow crest. It is similar to the then fashionable Macaroni.

Molecular clock evidence using DNA suggests the macaroni penguin diverged from its closest relative, the royal penguin (&quot;Eudyptes schlegeli&quot;), around 1.5 million years ago. The two have generally been considered different species, but the close similarities of their DNA sequences has led some, such as Australian ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles, to treat the royal penguin as a subspecies of the macaroni penguin. The two species are very similar in appearance; the royal penguin has a white face instead of the usually black face of the macaroni penguin. Interbreeding with the Indo-Pacific subspecies of the southern rockhopper penguin (&quot;E. chrysocome filholi&quot;) has been reported at Heard and Marion Islands, with three hybrid subspecies recorded there by a 1987–88 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition.

==Description==

The macaroni penguin is a large, crested penguin, similar in appearance to other members of the genus &quot;Eudyptes&quot;. An adult bird has an average length of around ; the weight varies markedly depending on time of year and sex. Males average from after incubating, or after moult to before moult, while females average after to before moult. Among standard measurements, the thick bill (from the gape) measures , the culmen being around a centimetre less. The wing, from the shoulder to the tip, is around and the tail is long. The head, chin, throat, and upper parts are black and sharply demarcated against the white under parts. The black plumage has a bluish sheen when new and brownish when old. The most striking feature is the yellow crest that arises from a patch on the centre of the forehead, and extends horizontally backwards to the nape. The flippers are blue-black on the upper surface with a white trailing edge, and mainly white underneath with a black tip and leading edge. The large, bulbous bill is orange-brown. The iris is red and a patch of pinkish bare skin is found from the base of the bill to the eye. The legs and feet are pink. The male and female are similar in appearance; males tend to be slightly larger. Males also bear relatively larger bills, which average around compared to in females; this feature has been used to tell the sexes apart.

Immature birds are distinguished by their smaller size, smaller, duller-brown bill, dark grey chin and throat, and absent or underdeveloped head plumes, often just a scattering of yellow feathers. The crest is fully developed in birds aged three to four years, a year or two before breeding age.

Macaroni penguins moult once a year, a process in which they replace all of their old feathers. They spend around two weeks accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult, as they cannot enter the water to forage for food without feathers. The process typically takes three to four weeks, which they spend sitting ashore. Once finished, they go back to sea and return to their colonies to mate in the spring. Overall survival rates are poorly known; the successful return of breeding adults at South Georgia Island varied between 49% and 78% over three years, and around 10% of those that did return did not breed the following year.

==Distribution and habitat==
A 1993 review estimated that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, with a minimum of 11,841,600 pairs worldwide. Macaroni penguins range from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula; at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites have been recorded. In South America, macaroni penguins are found in southern Chile, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and South Orkney Islands. They also occupy much of Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, including the northern South Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Prince Edward and Marion islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Heard and McDonald Islands. While foraging for food, groups will range north to the islands off Australia, New Zealand, southern Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, and South Africa.

==Ecology==
=== Feeding ===
The diet of the macaroni penguin consists of a variety of crustaceans, squid and fish; the proportions that each makes up vary with locality and season. Krill, particularly Antarctic krill (&quot;Euphausia superba&quot;), account for over 90% of food during breeding season. Cephalopods and small fish such as the marbled rockcod (&quot;Notothenia rossii&quot;), painted notie (&quot;Lepidonotothen larseni&quot;), &quot;Champsocephalus gunneri&quot;, the lanternfish species &quot;Krefftichthys anderssoni&quot;, &quot;Protomyctophum tenisoni&quot; and &quot;P. normani&quot; become more important during chick-rearing. Like several other penguin species, the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small (10– to 30-mm-diameter) stones; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep-sea diving, or to help grind food, especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans which are a significant part of its diet.

Foraging for food is generally conducted on a daily basis, from dawn to dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track the movement of the birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10–20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.

Foraging distance from colonies has been measured at around at South Georgia, offshore over the continental shelf, and anywhere from at Marion Island. Macaroni penguins normally forage at depths of , but have been recorded diving down to on occasions. Some night foraging does occur, but these dives are much shallower, ranging from only in depth. Dives rarely exceed two minutes in duration. All dives are V-shaped, and no time is spent at the sea bottom; about half the time on a foraging trip is spent diving. Birds have been calculated as catching from 4 to 16 krill or 40 to 50 amphipods per dive.

===Predators===
The macaroni penguin&#x27;s predators consist of birds and aquatic mammals. The leopard seal (&quot;Hydrurga leptonyx&quot;), Antarctic fur seal (&quot;Arctocephalus gazella&quot;), Subantarctic fur seal (&quot;A. tropicalis&quot;), and killer whale (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) hunt adult macaroni penguins in the water. Macaroni colonies suffer comparatively low rates of predation if undisturbed; predators generally only take eggs and chicks that have been left unattended or abandoned. Skua species, the snowy sheathbill &quot;(Chionis alba&quot;), and kelp gull (&quot;Larus dominicanus&quot;) prey on eggs, and skuas and giant petrels also take chicks and sick or injured adult birds.

==Life history==
Like most other penguin species, the macaroni penguin is a social animal in its nesting and its foraging behaviour; its breeding colonies are among the largest and most densely populated. Scientist Charles Andre Bost found that macaroni penguins nesting at Kerguelen dispersed eastwards over an area exceeding 3×106 km2. Fitted with geolocation sensors, the 12 penguins studied travelled over during the six- to seven-month study period and spent their time largely within a zone 47–49°S and 70–110°E in the central Indian Ocean, not coming ashore. This area, known as the Polar Frontal Zone, was notable for the absence of krill.

Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual, as well as vocal, displays. These behaviours peak early in the breeding period, and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea. Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or, alternatively, appease and avoid conflict with other individuals. Macaroni penguins, particularly those on adjacent nests, may engage in &#x27;bill-jousting&#x27;; birds lock bills and wrestle, each trying to unseat the other, as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent&#x27;s nape. Submissive displays include the &#x27;slender walk&#x27;, where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened, flippers moved to the front of the body, and head and neck hunched, and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest.

===Courtship and breeding===
Female macaroni penguins can begin breeding at around five years of age, while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old. Females breed at a younger age because the male population is larger. The surplus of male penguins allows the female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony, sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory, and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts. In the &#x27;ecstatic display&#x27;, a penguin bows forward, making loud throbbing sounds, and then extends its head and neck up until its neck and beak are vertical. The bird then waves its head from side to side, braying loudly. Birds also engage in mutual bowing, trumpeting, and preening. Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three-quarters of pairs will breed together again the following year.

Adult macaroni penguins typically begin to breed late in October, and lay their eggs in early November. The nest itself is a shallow scrape in the ground which may be lined with some pebbles, stones, or grass, or nestled in a clump of tussock grass (on South Georgia Island). Nests are densely packed, ranging from around apart in the middle of a colony to at the edges. A fertile macaroni penguin will lay two eggs each breeding season. The first egg to be laid weighs , 61–64% the size of the second, and is extremely unlikely to survive. The two eggs together weigh 4.8% of the mother&#x27;s body weight; the composition of an egg is 20% yolk, 66% albumen, and 14% shell. Like those of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick to minimise risk of breakage, and the yolk is large, which is associated with chicks born in an advanced stage of development. Some of the yolk remains at hatching and is consumed by the chick in its first few days.

The fate of the first egg is mostly unknown, but studies on the related royal penguin and erect-crested penguin show the female tips the egg out when the larger second egg is laid. The task of incubating the egg is divided into three roughly equal sessions of around 12 days each over a five-week period. The first session is shared by both parents, followed by the male returning to sea, leaving the female alone to tend the egg. Upon the male&#x27;s return, the female goes off to sea and does not return until the chick has hatched. Both sexes fast for a considerable period during breeding; the male fasts for 37 days after arrival until he returns to sea for around 10 days before fasting while incubating eggs and young for another 36 days, and the female fasts for 42 days from her arrival after the male until late in the incubation period. Both adults lose 36–40% of their body weight during this period. The second egg hatches around 34 days after it is laid. Macaroni penguins typically leave their breeding colony by April or May to disperse into the ocean.

From the moment the egg is hatched, the male macaroni penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since only a few of its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70 days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.

==Conservation==
The population of macaroni penguins is estimated at around 18 million mature individuals; a substantial decline has been recorded in several locations. This includes a 50% reduction in the South Georgia population between the mid-1970s to mid-1990s and the disappearance of the species from Isla Recalada in Southern Chile. This decline of the overall population in the last 30 years has resulted in the classification of the species as globally Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Long-term monitoring programs are underway at a number of breeding colonies, and many of the islands that support breeding populations of this penguin are protected reserves. The Heard Islands and McDonald Islands are World Heritage Sites for the macaroni penguin. The macaroni penguin may be being impacted by commercial fishing and marine pollution. A 2008 study suggests the abilities of female penguins to reproduce may be negatively affected by climate- and fishing-induced reductions in krill density.

<doc id="549322" wikidata="Q1477653" url="?curid=549322" title="Spatial light modulator">
<text>A spatial light modulator (SLM) is a device that can control the intensity, phase, or polarization of light in a spatially varying manner. A simple example is an overhead projector transparency. Usually when the term SLM is used, it means that the transparency can be controlled by a computer.

SLMs are primarily marketed for image projection, displays devices, and maskless lithography. SLMs are also used in optical computing and holographic optical tweezers.

Usually, an SLM modulates the intensity of the light beam. However, it is also possible to produce devices that modulate the phase of the beam or both the intensity and the phase simultaneously. It is also possible to produce devices that modulate the polarization of the beam, and modulate the polarization, phase, and intensity simultaneously.

SLMs are used extensively in holographic data storage setups to encode information into a laser beam similarly to the way a transparency does for an overhead projector. They can also be used as part of a holographic display technology.

In the 1980s, large SLMs were placed on overhead projectors to project computer monitor contents to the screen. Since then, more modern projectors have been developed where the SLM is built inside the projector. These are commonly used in meetings for presentations.

Liquid crystal SLMs can help solve problems related to laser microparticle manipulation. In this case spiral beam parameters can be changed dynamically.

==Electrically-addressed spatial light modulator (EASLM)==
As its name implies, the image on an electrically addressed spatial light modulator is created and changed electronically, as in most electronic displays. EASLMs usually receive input via a conventional interface such as VGA or DVI input. They are available at resolutions up to QXGA (2048 × 1536). Unlike ordinary displays, they are usually much smaller (having an active area of about 2 cm²) as they are not normally meant to be viewed directly. An example of an EASLM is the digital micromirror device (DMD) at the heart of DLP displays or LCoS Displays using ferroelectric liquid crystals (FLCoS) or nematic liquid crystals (electrically controlled birefringence effect).

Spatial light modulators can be either reflective or transmissive depending on their design and purpose.

DMDs, short for digital micromirror devices, are spatial light modulators that specifically work with binary amplitude-only modulation. Each pixel on the SLM can only be in one of two states: &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;. The main purpose of the SLM is to control and adjust the amplitude of the light.

Phase modulation can be achieved using a DMD by using Lee holography techniques, or by using the superpixel method.

==Optically-addressed spatial light modulator (OASLM)==
The image on an optically addressed spatial light modulator, also known as a light valve, is created and changed by shining light encoded with an image on its front or back surface. A photosensor allows the OASLM to sense the brightness of each pixel and replicate the image using liquid crystals. As long as the OASLM is powered, the image is retained even after the light is extinguished. An electrical signal is used to clear the whole OASLM at once.

They are often used as the second stage of a very-high-resolution display, such as one for a computer-generated holographic display. In a process called active tiling, images displayed on an EASLM are sequentially transferred to different parts on an OASLM, before the whole image on the OASLM is presented to the viewer. As EASLMs can run as fast as 2500 frames per second, it is possible to tile around 100 copies of the image on the EASLM onto an OASLM while still displaying full-motion video on the OASLM. This potentially gives images with resolutions of above 100 megapixels.

==Application in ultrafast pulse measuring and shaping==

Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a technique based on the computer-controlled phase scan of a linear-array spatial light modulator. Through the phase scan to an ultrashort pulse, MIIPS can not only characterize but also manipulate the ultrashort pulse to get the needed pulse shape at target spot (such as transform-limited pulse for optimized peak power, and other specific pulse shapes). This technique features with full calibration and control of the ultrashort pulse, with no moving parts, and simple optical setup. Linear array SLMs that use nematic liquid crystal elements are available that can modulate amplitude, phase, or both simultaneously.

<text>[[Andorra]] is essentially Catalan speaking. The country has contributed significantly to the Catalan heritage.

==Language and literature==
The official and historic language is Catalan. Thus the culture is Catalan, with its own specificity.

Two writers renowned in Catalonia and the region, Michele Gazier and Ramon Villero, both come from Andorra. In addition, Ricard Fiter, a renowned writer, not only comes from Andorra, but also serves as the Principality&#x27;s ombudsman. Yet the tradition of writing in Andorra dates farther back than the 20th century; Antoni Fiter i Rossell, from the parish of Ordino, wrote a history book of his lands called &quot;Digest manual de las valls neutras de Andorra&quot; in 1748, describing the feudal historical and legal setting of Andorra.

==Music==

Given the fondness of the Catalans for music, it may not be surprising to hear that Andorra has a Chamber Orchestra directed by the violinist Gérard Claret; and that it also stages an international singing contest supported by the Spanish singer Montserrat Caballé. In 2004, Andorra participated in the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time. This attracted media attention from Catalonia, since it was the first song to be sung in Catalan. The song was eliminated in the semi-finals, and the 2005 and 2006 entries also met the same fate. In 2009 they were eliminated in the semi-finals as well.

==Dance==
Typical dances, such as the &quot;marratxa&quot; and the &quot;contrapàs&quot;, are especially popular at feasts. Among famous feasts are the one honoring Sant Jordi, when books and roses are given as presents; the &quot;People&#x27;s feast&quot;, celebrating Saint John and the summer solstice, and the feast of Saint Stephen (Sant Esteve), patron saint of Andorra la Vella. Andorrans tend to celebrate their feasts gladly and loudly.

==Media==
Andorra&#x27;s constitution provides for full freedom of the media. There are two daily newspapers published in the principality, &quot;Diari d&#x27;Andorra&quot; and &quot;El Periòdic d&#x27;Andorra&quot;. Television services are broadcast by the public Ràdio i Televisió d&#x27;Andorra. Apart from the public Radio nacional d&#x27;Andorra, there is also the commercial radio station called Radio Valira.

<doc id="549333" wikidata="Q2025687" url="?curid=549333" title="Iron overload">
<text>Iron overload (also known as haemochromatosis or hemochromatosis) is the abnormal and increased accumulation of total iron in the body, leading to organ damage. The primary mechanism of organ damage is oxidative stress, as elevated intracellular iron levels increase free radical formation via the Fenton reaction. Iron overload is often &quot;primary&quot; (i.e. hereditary haemochromatosis) but may also be &quot;secondary&quot; to repeated blood transfusions (i.e. transfusional iron overload). Iron deposition most commonly occurs in the liver, pancreas, skin, heart, and joints. People with iron overload classically present with the triad of liver cirrhosis, secondary diabetes mellitus, and bronze skin. However, due to earlier detection nowadays, symptoms are often limited to general chronic malaise, arthralgia, and hepatomegaly.

==Signs and symptoms==

Organs most commonly affected by hemochromatosis include the liver, heart, and endocrine glands.

Hemochromatosis may present with the following clinical syndromes:
* liver: chronic liver disease and cirrhosis of the liver.
* heart: heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia.
* hormones: diabetes (see below) and hypogonadism (insufficiency of the sex hormone producing glands) which leads to low sex drive and/or loss of fertility in men and loss of fertility and menstrual cycle in women.
* metabolism: diabetes in people with iron overload occurs as a result of selective iron deposition in islet beta cells in the pancreas leading to functional failure and cell death.
* skeletal: arthritis, from iron deposition in joints leading to joint pains. The most commonly affected joints are those of the hands, particularly the knuckles or metacarpophalangeal joints, wrists or radiocarpal joints, elbow, hip, knee and ankle joints. Risk factors for the development of arthritis in those with hemochromatosis include elevated iron levels (ferritin greater than 1000 or transferrin saturation greater than 50%) for an extended period of time, increasing age and concurrent advanced liver fibrosis.
* skin: melanoderma (darkening or &#x27;bronzing&#x27; of the skin).
Hemochromatosis leading to secondary diabetes (through iron deposition in the insulin secreting beta cells of the pancreas), when combined with a bronzing or darkening of the skin, is sometimes known as &quot;bronze diabetes&quot;.

==Causes==
The term &quot;hemochromatosis&quot; was initially used to refer to what is now more specifically called hemochromatosis type 1 (or HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis). Currently, hemochromatosis (without further specification) is mostly defined as iron overload with a hereditary or primary cause, or originating from a metabolic disorder. However, the term is currently also used more broadly to refer to any form of iron overload, thus requiring specification of the cause, for example, &quot;hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;.

=== Primary hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis ===
==== Hereditary hemochromatosis ====
Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with estimated prevalence in the population of 1 in 200 among patients with European ancestry, with lower incidence in other ethnic groups. Mutations of the HFE gene (hemostatic iron regulator) located on chromosome 6 (responsible for iron regulatory protein hepcidin production) are responsible for most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis; 95% of cases of hereditary hemochromatosis involve a mutation of this HFE gene. Non-HFE hereditary hemochromatosis involves mutations in genes coding for the iron regulatory proteins hemojuvelin, transferrin receptor-2 and ferroportin.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by an accelerated rate of intestinal iron absorption and progressive iron deposition in various tissues. This typically begins to be expressed in the third to fifth decades of life, but may occur in children. The most common presentation is hepatic cirrhosis in combination with hypopituitarism, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, arthritis, or hyperpigmentation. Because of the severe sequelae of this disorder if left untreated, and recognizing that treatment is relatively simple, early diagnosis before symptoms or signs appear is important.

==== Hemosiderosis ====
In general, the term &quot;hemosiderosis&quot; is used to indicate the pathological effect of iron accumulation in any given organ, which mainly occurs in the form of the iron-storage complex hemosiderin. Sometimes, the simpler term siderosis is used instead.

Other definitions distinguishing hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis that are occasionally used include:
* Hemosiderosis is hemochromatosis caused by excessive blood transfusions, that is, hemosiderosis is a form of secondary hemochromatosis.
* Hemosiderosis is hemosiderin deposition within cells, while hemochromatosis is hemosiderin within cells and interstitium.
* Hemosiderosis is iron overload that does not cause tissue damage, while hemochromatosis does.
* Hemosiderosis is arbitrarily differentiated from hemochromatosis by the reversible nature of the iron accumulation in the reticuloendothelial system.
The causes of hemochromatosis broken down into two subcategories: &quot;primary cases&quot; (hereditary or genetically determined) and less frequent &quot;secondary cases&quot; (acquired during life). People of Northern European descent, including Celtic (Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Cornish, Breton etc.), English, and Scandinavian origin have a particularly high incidence, with about 10% being carriers of the principal genetic variant, the C282Y mutation on the HFE gene, and 1% having the condition.

==== Non-classical hereditary hemochromatosis ====
The overwhelming majority depend on mutations of the HFE gene discovered in 1996, but since then others have been discovered and sometimes are grouped together as &quot;non-classical hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, &quot;non-HFE related hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, or &quot;non-HFE hemochromatosis&quot;.

Most types of hereditary hemochromatosis have autosomal recessive inheritance, while type 4 has autosomal dominant inheritance.

===Secondary hemochromatosis===
* Severe chronic hemolysis of any cause, including intravascular hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis (hemolysis within the bone marrow)
* Multiple frequent blood transfusions (either whole blood or just red blood cells), which are usually needed either by individuals with hereditary anaemias (such as beta-thalassaemia major, sickle cell anaemia, and Diamond–Blackfan anaemia) or by older patients with severe acquired anaemias such as in myelodysplastic syndromes.
* Excess parenteral (non-ingested) iron supplements, such as what can acutely happen in iron poisoning
* Excess dietary iron
* Some disorders do not normally cause hemochromatosis on their own, but may do so in the presence of other predisposing factors. These include cirrhosis (especially related to alcohol use disorder), steatohepatitis of any cause, porphyria cutanea tarda, prolonged hemodialysis, and post-portacaval shunting

==Pathophysiology==
Defects in iron metabolism, specifically involving the iron regulatory protein hepcidin are thought to play an integral role in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis.

Normally, hepcidin acts to reduce iron levels in the body by inhibiting intestinal iron absorption and inhibiting iron mobilization from stores in the bone marrow and liver. Iron is absorbed from the intestines (mostly in the duodenum) and transported across intestinal enterocytes or mobilized out of storage in liver hepatocytes or from macrophages in the bone marrow by the transmembrane ferroportin transporter. In response to elevated plasma iron levels, hepcidin inhibits the ferroportin transporter leading to decreased iron mobilization from stores and decreased intestinal iron absorption, thus functioning as a negative iron regulatory protein.

In hereditary hemochromatosis, mutations in the proteins involved in hepcidin production including HFE (hemostatic iron regulator), hemojuvelin and transferrin receptor 2 lead to a loss or decrease in hepcidin production, which subsequently leads to the loss of the inhibitory signal regulating iron absorption and mobilization and thus leads to iron overload. In very rare instances, mutations in ferroportin result in ferroportin resistance to hepcidin&#x27;s negative regulatory effects, and continued intestinal iron absorption and mobilization despite inhibitory signaling from hepcidin. Approximately 95% of cases of hereditary hemochromatosis are due to mutations in the HFE gene.

The resulting iron overload causes iron to deposit in various sites throughout the body, especially the liver and joints, which coupled with oxidative stress leads to organ damage or joint damage and the pathological findings seen in hemochromatosis.

==Diagnosis==
There are several methods available for diagnosing and monitoring iron overload.

===Blood test===

Blood tests are usually the initial test if there is a clinical suspicion of iron overload. Serum ferritin testing is a low-cost, readily available, and minimally invasive method for assessing body iron stores. However ferritin levels may be elevated due to a variety of other causes including obesity, infection, inflammation (as an acute phase protein), chronic alcohol intake, liver disease, kidney disease, and cancer. In males and postmenopausal females, normal range of serum ferritin is between 12 and 300 ng/mL (670 pmol/L) . In premenopausal females, normal range of serum ferritin is between 12 and 150 or 200 ng/mL (330 or 440 pmol/L). In those with hemochromatosis, the serum ferritin level correlates with the degree of iron overload. Ferritin levels are usually monitored serially in those with hemochromatosis to assess response to treatment.

Elevations in serum levels of the iron transporter protein transferrin saturation as well as increased red blood cell mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration usually precede ferritin elevations in hemochromatosis. Transferrin saturation of greater than 45% combined with an elevated ferritin level is highly sensitive in diagnosing HFE hemochromatosis. Total iron binding capacity may be low in hemochromatosis, but can also be normal.

===Genetics===

General screening for hemochromatosis is not recommended, however first-degree relatives of those affected should be screened.

Once iron overload has been established, &quot;HFE&quot; gene mutation genetic testing for hereditary causes of iron overload is indicated. The presence of &quot;HFE&quot; gene mutations in addition to iron overload confirms the clinical diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. The alleles evaluated by &quot;HFE&quot; gene analysis are evident in ~80% of patients with hemochromatosis; a negative report for HFE gene does not rule out hemochromatosis.

=== Biopsy ===
Liver biopsy is the removal of small sample in order to be studied and can determine the cause of inflammation or cirrhosis. In someone with negative &quot;HFE&quot; gene testing, elevated iron status for no other obvious reason, and family history of liver disease, additional evaluation of liver iron concentration is indicated. In this case, diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on biochemical analysis and histologic examination of a liver biopsy. Assessment of the hepatic iron index (HII) is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for diagnosis of hemochromatosis.

===Imaging===
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used as a noninvasive method to estimate iron deposition levels in the liver and heart, which may aid in determining a response to treatment or prognosis. Liver elastography has limited utility in detecting liver fibrosis in hemochromatosis.

==Treatment==

=== Phlebotomy ===

Phlebotomy, bloodletting or venesection is the mainstay of treatment in iron overload, consisting of regularly scheduled blood draws to remove red blood cells (and iron) from the body. Upon initial diagnosis of iron overload, the phlebotomies may be performed weekly or twice weekly, until iron levels are normalized. Once the serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are within the normal range, maintenance phlebotomies may be needed in some (depending upon the rate of reabsorption of iron), scheduled at varying frequencies to keep iron stores within normal range. A phlebotomy session typically draws between 450 and 500 mL of blood. Routine phlebotomy may reverse liver fibrosis and alleviate some symptoms of hemochromatosis, but chronic arthritis is usually not responsive to treatment. In those with hemochromatosis; the blood drawn during phlebotomy is safe to be donated.

Phlebotomy is associated with improved survival if it is initiated before the onset of cirrhosis or diabetes.

=== Diet ===

The human diet contains iron in two forms: heme iron and non-heme iron. Heme iron is usually found in red meat, whereas non-heme iron is found in plant based sources. Heme iron is the most easily absorbed form of iron. In those with hemochromatosis undergoing phlebotomy for treatment; restriction of dietary iron is not required. However, those who do restrict dietary iron usually require less phlebotomy (about 0.5–1.5 liters of blood less per year). Vitamin C and iron supplementation should be avoided as vitamin C accelerates intestinal absorption of iron and mobilization of body iron stores. Raw seafood should be avoided because of increased risk of infections from iron loving pathogens such as &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot;. Alcohol consumption should be avoided due to the risk of compounded liver damage with iron overload.

=== Medication ===

Medications are used for those unable to tolerate routine blood draws, there are chelating agents available for use. The drug deferoxamine binds with iron in the bloodstream and enhances its elimination in urine and faeces. Typical treatment for chronic iron overload requires subcutaneous injection over a period of 8–12 hours daily. Two newer iron-chelating drugs that are licensed for use in patients receiving regular blood transfusions to treat thalassaemia (and, thus, who develop iron overload as a result) are deferasirox and deferiprone.

===Chelating polymers===

A minimally invasive approach to hereditary hemochromatosis treatment is the maintenance therapy with polymeric chelators. These polymers or particles have a negligible or null systemic biological availability and they are designed to form stable complexes with Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the GIT and thus limiting their uptake and long-term accumulation. Although this method has only a limited efficacy, unlike small-molecular chelators, the approach has virtually no side effects in sub-chronic studies. Interestingly, the simultaneous chelation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ increases the treatment efficacy.

==Prognosis==

In general, provided there has been no liver damage, patients should expect a normal life expectancy if adequately treated by venesection. If the serum ferritin is greater than 1,000 μg/L at diagnosis there is a risk of liver damage and cirrhosis which may eventually shorten their life. The presence of cirrhosis increases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Other risk factors for liver damage in hemochromatosis include alcohol use, diabetes, liver iron levels greater than 2,000 μmol/gram and increased aspartate transaminase levels.

The risk of death and liver fibrosis are elevated in males with HFE type hemochromatosis but not in females; this is thought to be due to a protective effect of menstruation and pregnancy seen in females as well as possible hormone-related differences in iron absorption.

==Epidemiology==

HHC is most common in certain European populations (such as those of Irish or Scandinavian descent) and occurs in 0.6% of some unspecified population. Men have a 24-fold increased rate of iron-overload disease compared with women.

===Stone Age===
Diet and the environment are thought to have had large influence on the mutation of genes related to iron overload. Starting during the Mesolithic era, communities of people lived in an environment that was fairly sunny, warm and had the dry climates of the Middle East. Most humans who lived at that time were foragers and their diets consisted largely of wild plants, fish, and game. Archaeologists studying dental plaque have found evidence of tubers, nuts, plantains, grasses and other foods rich in iron. Over many generations, the human body became well-adapted to a high level of iron content in the diet.

=== Neolithic ===
In the Neolithic era, significant changes are thought to have occurred in both the environment and diet. Some communities of foragers migrated north, leading to changes in lifestyle and environment, with a decrease in temperatures and a change in the landscape which the foragers then needed to adapt to. As people began to develop and advance their tools, they learned new ways of producing food, and farming also slowly developed. These changes would have led to serious stress on the body and a decrease in the consumption of iron-rich foods. This transition is a key factor in the mutation of genes, especially those that regulated dietary iron absorption. Iron, which makes up 70% of red blood cell composition, is a critical micronutrient for effective thermoregulation in the body. Iron deficiency will lead to a drop in the core temperature. In the chilly and damp environments of Northern Europe, supplementary iron from food was necessary to keep temperatures regulated, however, without sufficient iron intake the human body would have started to store iron at higher rates than normal. In theory, the pressures caused by migrating north would have selected for a gene mutation that promoted greater absorption and storage of iron.

===Viking hypothesis===
Studies and surveys conducted to determine the frequencies of hemochromatosis help explain how the mutation migrated around the globe. In theory, the disease initially evolved from travelers migrating from the north. Surveys show a particular distribution pattern with large clusters and frequencies of gene mutations along the western European coastline. This led the development of the &quot;Viking Hypothesis&quot;. Cluster locations and mapped patterns of this mutation correlate closely to the locations of Viking settlements in Europe established c.700 AD to c.1100 AD. The Vikings originally came from Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Viking ships made their way along the coastline of Europe in search of trade, riches, and land. Genetic studies suggest that the extremely high frequency patterns in some European countries are the result of migrations of Vikings and later Normans, indicating a genetic link between hereditary hemochromatosis and Viking ancestry.

===Modern times===
In 1865, Armand Trousseau (a French internist) was one of the first to describe many of the symptoms of a diabetic patient with cirrhosis of the liver and bronzed skin color. The term hemochromatosis was first used by German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1889 when he described an accumulation of iron in body tissues.

== Identification of genetic factors ==
Although it was known most of the 20th century that most cases of hemochromatosis were inherited, they were incorrectly assumed to depend on a single gene.

In 1935 J.H. Sheldon, a British physician, described the link to iron metabolism for the first time as well as demonstrating its hereditary nature.

In 1996 Felder and colleagues identified the hemochromatosis gene, &quot;HFE&quot; gene. Felder found that the &quot;HFE&quot; gene has two main mutations, causing amino acid substitutions C282Y and H63D, which were the main cause of hereditary hemochromatosis. The next year the CDC and the National Human Genome Research Institute sponsored an examination of hemochromatosis following the discovery of the &quot;HFE&quot; gene, which helped lead to the population screenings and estimates that are still being used today.

<doc id="549334" wikidata="Q1907209" url="?curid=549334" title="Flags of the Ottoman Empire">
<text>The Ottoman Empire used various flags and naval ensigns during its history. The crescent and star came into use in the second half of the 18th century. A &quot;&quot; (decree) from 1793 required that the ships of the Ottoman Navy were to use a red flag with the star and crescent in white. In 1844, a version of this flag, with a five-pointed star, was officially adopted as the Ottoman national flag. The decision to adopt a national flag was part of the &quot;Tanzimat&quot; reforms which aimed to modernize the Ottoman state in line with the laws and norms of contemporary European states and institutions. 

The star and crescent design later became a common element in the national flags of Ottoman successor states in the 20th century.
The current flag of Turkey is essentially the same as the late Ottoman flag, but has more specific legal standardizations (regarding its measures, geometric proportions, and exact tone of red) that were introduced with the Turkish Flag Law on 29 May 1936. Before the legal standardization, the star and crescent could have slightly varying slimness or positioning depending on the rendition.

== Early flag ==
Pre-modern Ottoman armies used the horse-tail standard or &quot;tugh&quot; rather than flags.
Such standards remained in use alongside flags until the 19th century. A depiction of a tugh appears in the &#x27; by Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (1718).
War flags came into use by the 16th century. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Ottoman war flags often depicted the bifurcated &quot;Zulfiqar&quot; sword, often misinterpreted in Western literature as showing a pair of scissors.

The crescent symbol appears in flags attributed to Tunis from as early as the 14th century (&quot;), long before Tunis fell under Ottoman rule in 1574. But the crescent as a symbol also had 14th-century associations with the Ottoman military 
and millennium-long associations with the city of Istanbul,
which became the Ottoman capital after its conquest in 1453. The Spanish Navy Museum in Madrid shows two Ottoman naval flags dated 1613; both are swallow-tailed, one green with a white crescent near the hoist, the other white with two red stripes near the edges of the flag and a red crescent near the hoist.

==Crescent and star flag==

The star and crescent design appears on Ottoman flags beginning in the late 18th or early 19th century. The white star and crescent moon with a red background was introduced as the flag of the Ottoman Empire in 1844.

===Source of the Star and Crescent symbol===

It has been suggested that the star-and-crescent used in Ottoman flags of the 19th century had been adopted from the Byzantine. Franz Babinger (1992) suggests this possibility, noting that the crescent alone has a much older tradition also with Turkic tribes in the interior of Asia. The crescent and star is found on the coinage of Byzantium since the 4th century BC and was depicted on Byzantine Empire&#x27;s coins and shields of Christian warrior saints till the 13th century. Parsons (2007) notes that the star and crescent was not a widespread motive on the coinage of Byzantium at the time of the Ottoman conquest. Turkish historians tend to stress the antiquity of the &quot;crescent&quot; (not star-and-crescent) symbol among the early Turkic states in Asia.

==Imperial standards==
The imperial standard displayed the sultan&#x27;s tughra, often on a pink or bright red background.

The standard used by the last Caliph, Abdulmejid II (between 19 November 1922 – 3 March 1924) consisted of a green flag with a star and crescent in white on a red oval background within a rayed ornament, all in white.

==Army Flags and Standards with Shahada==
The Ottoman army often used verses from the Quran and Shahada on their flags. This tradition continued during the First World War. When Ottoman Turkey joined the war on the side of the Central Powers in 1914, it declared a jihad against the Entente States. The modern Ottoman Turkish army used the Ottoman state coat of arms on one side of their standard regimental flags and Shahada on the other. The Ottoman regimental flags consisted of gold writings and the state emblem on a red background. After the empire was abolished in 1922, this practice continued for a while in modern Turkey.

<text>The gargoyle gecko, knob-headed giant gecko, New Caledonia bumpy gecko, or New Caledonian bumpy gecko (Rhacodactylus auriculatus) is a species of gecko found only on the southern end of the island of New Caledonia. Its habitat is threatened by deforestation on the island. This species of gecko is the smallest of the six recognized species in its genus where they often reach about 125 mm in size. This gecko, along with several other &quot;Rhacodactylus&quot; species are being considered for protective measures by CITES, which would put restrictions on their exportation. This gecko was first described by Bavay in 1869.

== Description ==
This reptile gets its common name from the cranial bumps that give the appearance of horns or ears; in fact, &quot;auriculatus&quot; is Latin for &quot;ears&quot; or &quot;eared&quot;, depending on the case. Other characteristics of this gecko include a thin prehensile tail which will regenerate if it drops off, as well as small adhesive toe pads. Although these geckos have the ability to grip vines, branches, and other obstacles, most do not have the ability to climb sheer surfaces, such as glass. As small as long (from snout to vent) and weighing 3 grams at hatching, it reaches an average length of to and 60 to 70 grams in weight. They are considered a small to medium size gecko.

== Behavior ==
Gargoyle geckos are primarily nocturnal. They are an arboreal species, making their home in scrub forests. The female lays two eggs per clutch, which hatch 60 to 90 days after they are laid. The female can lay eight or nine clutches per year. On rare occasions, gargoyle geckos can reproduce asexually via parthenogenesis.

In their native habitat of southern New Caledonia, they have been known to sustain themselves from a mixed diet. One study found that they regularly consume a wide taxonomic and ecological variety of arthropods, lizard prey including geckos and skinks, and various plant materials including floral parts and sap.

They can propel themselves almost three times their body length to reach a vine or tree branch, yet their feet do not have as much traction as other gecko&#x27;s feet do, so they slip every now and then, making them seem clumsy. Moving about is no problem to them, as long as their skin is kept moist, it will stretch and accommodate their movements.

== In captivity ==
This gecko species is commonly kept as a pet by hobbyists. They occur in many colors, including varying shades of greys, browns, white, yellow, orange, and red, with varying patterns of blotches and striping. They are commonly captive bred for particular traits of pattern and color, like many captive geckos.

<doc id="549355" wikidata="Q17064566" url="?curid=549355" title="Lie-to-children">
<text>A lie-to-children is a simplified, and often technically incorrect, explanation of technical or complex subjects employed as a teaching method. Educators who employ lies-to-children do not intend to deceive, but instead seek to &#x27;meet the child/pupil/student where they are&#x27;, in order to facilitate initial comprehension, which they build upon over time as the learner&#x27;s intellectual capacity expands. The technique has been incorporated by academics within the fields of biology, evolution, bioinformatics and the social sciences.

== Origin and development ==
The &quot;lie-to-children&quot; concept was first discussed by scientist Jack Cohen and mathematician Ian Stewart in the 1994 book &quot;The Collapse of Chaos: Discovering Simplicity in a Complex World&quot; as myths—a means of ensuring that accumulated cultural lore is passed on to future generations in a way that was sufficient but not completely true.

They further elaborated upon their views in &quot;Figments of Reality: The Evolution of the Curious Mind&quot;, stating that the lie-to-children concept reflected the difficulty inherent in reducing complex concepts during the education process. Stewart and Cohen noted that &quot;[a]ny description suitable for human minds to grasp must be type of lie-to-children&quot;, and that the truth is &quot;much too complicated for our limited minds&quot;. 

The concept gained greater exposure when they coauthored &quot;The Science of Discworld&quot; with author Terry Pratchett. In this book, the authors acknowledge that some people might dispute the applicability of the term &quot;lie&quot;, while defending it on the grounds that &quot;it is for the best possible reasons, but it is still a lie&quot;. In an interview promoting the book, Pratchett cautioned: &quot;Most of us need just &#x27;enough&#x27; knowledge of the sciences, and it&#x27;s delivered to us in metaphors and analogies that bite us in the bum if we think they&#x27;re the same as the truth.&quot;

== Examples in education ==
A typical example of a lie-to-children is found in physics, where the Bohr model of atomic electron shells is still often used to introduce atomic structure before moving on to more complex models based on matrix mechanics. Similarly in chemistry, students are often introduced to the Arrhenius definitions of acids and bases before being taught the more technically correct but more complex Brønsted–Lowry model, followed by the Lewis model. This order of teaching chemistry concepts also reflects the historical progression in the development of these models.

High school teachers and university instructors often explain at the outset that the model they are about to present is incomplete. An example of this was given by Gerald Sussman during the 1986 video recording of the Abelson–Sussman Lectures:
== Analysis ==
=== Comparison to other concepts ===
Andrew Sawyer compared the concept to that of science fiction in the article &quot;Narrativium and Lies-to-children: &#x27;Palatable Instruction in &#x27;The Science of Discworld, in which he wrote: &quot;The &#x27;lies-to-children&#x27; we tell ourselves about science are a different form of science fiction: one, perhaps where &#x27;fiction&#x27; qualifies the word &#x27;science&#x27;. They are &#x27;fictions about science&#x27; rather than &#x27;science fictions&#x27;.&quot;

Anthony Judge has noted that the concept itself is a lie-to-children for more complex concepts in the philosophy of science.

Writing for &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2015, physics professor and science journalist Chad Orzel explored how the University of California Museum of Paleontology initiative Understanding Science goes beyond a simple explanation of the scientific method in a lie-to-children format, and instead goes into more depth and specifics to directly inform others on how science impacts their daily quality of living.

=== Application across fields ===
Writing for &quot;Forbes&quot;, Tim Worstall commented on the lie-to-children&#x27;s application in physics and music, where lessons on scales precede those on atonality, common time and half time precede syncopation. He noted that Newton&#x27;s physics is a lie-to-children compared to Einstein&#x27;s additions.

In &quot;Nonlinear Dynamics in the Life and Social Sciences&quot;, Jack Cohen discussed the application of lies-to-children to teaching evolution, including the notion of DNA&#x27;s purpose as a &quot;blueprint&quot;, stating that &quot;[o]nly the search for universal features, while treasuring all the exceptional specifics, offers some hope of sketching out the general shape of the evolutionary process so that we can explain it honestly as a Lie-to-Children&quot;. Similarly, in &quot;Bioinformatics, Biocomputing and Perl&quot;, authors Michael Moorhouse and Paul Barry explained how the lie-to-children model may be utilized as a teaching technique for the concepts of protein, RNA, and DNA.

In a computer science paper on linear algebra instruction, D. J. Jeffrey and Robert M. Corless from the University of Western Ontario identified an example from early childhood mathematics instruction: &quot;We happily teach children that &#x27;you cannot take 3 from 2&#x27; because we are confident that someone will later introduce them to negative numbers.&quot; Corless followed up on this view in a subsequent paper, stating that &quot;mathematics before computers was a lie to children&quot;.

=== Drawbacks ===
In &quot;Evolving the Alien: The Science of Extraterrestrial Life&quot;, Cohen and Stewart themselves warned of a potential side effect of lies-to-children in reducing complex science concepts to overly simplified explanations. In a paper published in &quot;Digital Difference&quot;, Jen Ross and Hamish Macleod wrote that lies-to-children can have a negative impact on learners by setting an unreasonable expectation for &quot;simple and unambiguous questions and equally simple answers&quot;.

In the journal &quot;Metaphilosophy&quot;, Kirsten Walsh and Adrian Currie drew a distinction between &quot;caricature&quot; and &quot;mythmaking&quot; in the framework of lies-to-children, and concluded that mythmaking is unjustified. North Eastern Hill University economics professor Sudhanshu K. Mishra explored the use of mythology in parenting, such as the case of parents telling children that they were brought by a stork to the house, instead of providing a more adequate explanation of childbirth. In &quot;The Children&#x27;s Bill of Emotional Rights&quot;, Eileen Johnson discussed the problems that childhood mythology could cause in the future during the parenting process. Johnson cautioned that the lie must eventually be revealed, and that parents &quot;are not sure how much of this deceit is right, how far to go with it, and how and when to explain it was all a lie&quot;.

In a column for the Carleton College blog &quot;Earth and Mind&quot;, geophysicist Kim Kastens and her daughter Dana Chayes listed potential pitfalls, such as how a lie-to-children that must later be unlearned may provide a potential obstacle to subsequent teachers, or how a student may discern the lie. They also listed criteria to avoid the pitfalls, such as ensuring that the teacher understands the truth beyond the lie-to-children, and having a &quot;master plan&quot; of a learning progression that the lies-to-children work toward. In a contribution to &quot;Teaching Bilingual/Bicultural Children&quot;, Haroom Kharem and Genevieve Collura asserted that the revelation of lie-to-children makes educators seem disingenuous and undermines students&#x27; respect for them.

<text>The World Data Centre (WDC) system was created to archive and distribute data collected from the observational programmes of the 1957–1958 International Geophysical Year by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). The WDCs were funded and maintained by their host countries on behalf of the international science community.

Originally established in the United States (WDC A), Soviet Union (WDC B), Europe and Japan (WDC C), the WDC system expanded to other countries and to new scientific disciplines. The WDC system included up to 52 Centres in 15 countries, with some data centres replicating another. All data held in WDCs were available for the cost of copying and sending the requested information. In 1968 the ICSU Panel on World Data Centers (Geophysical, Solar, and Environmental) was established to coordinate activities and to establish operating criteria for the WDCs.

At the end of 2008, following the ICSU General Assembly in Maputo (Mozambique), the World Data Centres were reformed and a new ISC World Data System (WDS) established in 2009. Expanding on the 50-year heritage of the ICSU World Data Centre system (WDC) and the ICSU Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical data-analysis Services, most of the legacy data centers and services continued under the WDS.

<doc id="549369" wikidata="Q508175" url="?curid=549369" title="Proculus">
<text>Proculus (died c. 281) was a Roman usurper, one of the &quot;minor pretenders&quot; according to &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, who would have taken the purple against Emperor Probus in 280. This is now disputed.

Probably Proculus had family connection with the Franks, to whom he turned in vain when his bid for imperial power was failing. He was a native of Albingaunum (modern Albenga in Liguria in north-west Italy). Though he was accounted a noble, his ancestors had been brigands and were the source of his vast wealth. Proculus was able to arm 2000 slaves of his own latifundia after seizing imperial office in the West. He was married to a woman named Vituriga, who was given the nickname &quot;Samso&quot; for her capabilities (considered &quot;unwomanly&quot; by the fourth century author of &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;), and at the time of his usurpation, he had one son, Herennianus, aged four.

Proculus was an ambitious soldier, who had commanded more than one legion as tribune; when in 280 he was asked by the people of Lugdunum (Lyon) who had started a rebellion against Emperor Probus to take the purple, he accepted, proclaiming himself joint emperor with Bonosus. &quot;He was, nevertheless, of some benefit to the Gauls, for he crushed the Alamanni — who then were still called Germans — and not without illustrious glory, though he never fought save in brigand-fashion&quot; (&quot;Historia Augusta&quot;)

On his return from fighting the Sassanids in Syria, Probus forced Proculus to retreat north. After failing to find support among the Franks, he was betrayed by them and handed over to Probus. Probus had Proculus killed (ca. 281), but spared his family &quot; with his accustomed moderation, and spared the fortunes as well as the lives of their innocent families,&quot; (Gibbon, I.12) who remained at Albingaunum, declaring, according to &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, that they wished neither to be princes nor brigands.

There exists a letter by Proculus that was cited by Gibbon and that is perhaps fictitious, but notable regardless. It begins with an apparent boast about his sexual prowess: &quot;From Proculus to his kinsman Maecianus, greeting. I have taken one hundred maidens from Sarmatia. Of these I mated with ten in a single night...&quot; Gibbon comments of Proculus and his co-usurper Bonosus, a heavy drinker, that the &quot;distinguished merit of those two officers was their respective prowess, of the one in the combats of Bacchus, of the other in those of Venus&quot;.

<doc id="549371" wikidata="Q23893993" url="?curid=549371" title="Metalinguistic abstraction">
<text>In computer science, metalinguistic abstraction is the process of solving complex problems by creating a new language or vocabulary to better understand the problem space. More generally, it also encompasses the ability or skill of a programmer to think outside of the pre-conceived notions of a specific language in order to exploratorily investigate a problem space in search of the kind of solutions which are most natural or cognitively ergonomic to it. It is a recurring theme in the seminal MIT textbook &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot;, which uses Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, as a framework for constructing new languages.

==Explanation==
For example, consider modelling an airport inside a computer. The airport has elements like passengers, bookings, employees, budgets, planes, luggage, arrivals and departures, and transit services.

A procedural (e.g. C) programmer might create data structures to represent these elements of an airport and procedures or routines to operate on those data structures and update them, modelling the airport as a series of processes undergone by its various elements. E.g., bookings is a database used to keep passengers and planes synchronised via updates logged as arrivals and departures, budgets are similar but for money: airports are a lot of things that need to get done in the right order to see that passengers get where they&#x27;re going.

An object-oriented (e.g. Java) programmer might create objects to represent the elements of the airport with methods which represent their behaviors, modelling the airport as a collection of possibly related things which characteristically interact with each other. E.g., passengers, employees, and planes possess location attributes which can be modified via applicable transit methods: transit services have methods to bring employees and passengers to and from airports, planes have methods to bring passengers along with themselves between different airports: airports are a grouping of things working together as intended.

A functional (e.g. Scheme) programmer might create higher-order functions representing both the elements and behaviors or processes of the airport, modelling the airport as a map of relations between elements in its various domains and those in their assorted codomains. E.g., airports map budgets to bookings schedules, each of which is itself a map of elements to elements: balances of income and expenditure, and balances of arrivals and departures, each of which is, recursively, its own mapping of elements and their own mappings in kind, collectively comprising a set of morphisms: airports are, transitively, the evaluative transformation of a certain spacetime economy.

Finally, a metalinguistic programmer might abstract the problem by creating new domain-specific languages for modelling airports, with peculiar primitives and types for doing so. The new language could encompass any or all of the above approaches where most suitable, potentially enabling the programmer to retain both the abstract generality of the functional model, the intuitive sensibility of the object model, and the detail-driven pragmatism of the procedural model.

Because the creation of functional metalinguistic abstractions in non-functional languages can be cumbersome while the reverse is usually trivial (e.g. it is generally much easier to take a side-effect-free programming abstraction and simply add effects to it than it is to take a stateful abstraction and work around or encapsulate its propagation of state), and because of the syntactic flexibility and referential safety of functional macros, metalinguistic programming is mostly idiomatic of functional programming languages.

<text>This is a list of vegetarian and vegan festivals which are held around the world to promote veganism and/or vegetarianism among the public and to support and link individuals and organizations that practice, promote or endorse veganism or vegetarianism. Many of these events are also food festivals and/or music festivals and can also contain edutainment.

== List ==

Some vegetarian and vegan festivals are held in multiple countries at multiple times a year. These include:
* Veganmania

*Düsseldorf. The 5th edition was held in 2019.

<text>HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; was a commissioned in September 1937. She took part in the Fleet Air Arm raid that crippled the Italian Fleet at Taranto in 1940. She had the unfortunate experience of sinking two Allied ships during her wartime service, once through accidental collision and the other by gunfire after a case of mistaken identity.

== Construction ==

Laid down on 16 April 1935, &quot;Glasgow&quot; was launched on 20 June 1936 by Lucy Baldwin, the wife of the prime minister Stanley Baldwin. She entered service without some components of her main armament&#x27;s fire control system, which were subsequently fitted at the end of that year. She commenced sea trials in the spring of 1937. Designed with a maximum speed of she achieved at standard displacement during her trials. She was subsequently commissioned on 9 September 1937.

== Service history ==
=== Pre-war service ===

Upon entering service &quot;Glasgow&quot; was allocated to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet. Her service was mostly uneventful, consisting of fleet exercises and &#x27;flag showing&#x27;. Her most glamorous operation was when together with her sister HMS &quot;Southampton&quot; she escorted the liner &quot;Empress of Australia&quot; on the outward and the liner &quot;Empress of Britain&quot; on the return voyage carrying King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to Canada on their royal visit to the United States and Canada in May and June 1939.

=== Norwegian Campaign ===

&quot;Glasgow&quot; remained allocated to the Home Fleet during the first year of the Second World War, under the command of Captain Frank Pegram from July 1939 to April 1940.

With war approaching, &quot;Glasgow&quot; sailed on 2 September 1939 from Grimsby to patrol off the Norwegian coast with Humber Force to intercept any German commerce raider attempting to reach the Atlantic or any blockade runner returning to Germany. While operating with the Humber Force she in company with the cruisers &quot;Southampton&quot; and &quot;Edinburgh&quot; was subjected to a heavy air attack by the Luftwaffe on 9 October 1939, but suffered no damage despite 120 bombs being dropped on the ships.

On the outbreak of war, she operated off the Scandinavian coast, and in November was off the coast of Norway with two destroyers in the hope of intercepting the German passenger ship which had sailed from Murmansk. This was unsuccessful, but on 12 February 1940, she captured the German trawler off Tromsø.

On 9 April 1940, she was attacked off Bergen by Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 aircraft and damaged by two near misses. Both bombs fell about from the ship&#x27;s side, one bursting on impact abreast station 70 and the other under water further forward. A large proportion of the bomb which burst on impact entered the ship above the lower deck level, holing an area of approximately with about 60 scattered splinters entering the ship&#x27;s side in all. The ship&#x27;s movement allowed a considerable quantity of water to enter the hull causing the messdecks between stations 53 – 74 to be flooded by of water. Some minor underwater damage and a small amount of flooding occurred further forward, probably as a result of the other bomb. In addition the forward &#x27;A&#x27; turret was temporarily out of action. Two crew members were killed and five were wounded. After returning to Scapa Flow on 10 April for temporary repairs and transfer of the dead and wounded the ship returned to sea 22 hours later.

On 11 April 1940, during the Allied campaign in Norway in World War II, &quot;Glasgow&quot;, along with and six s landed troops near Harstad and three days later on 14 April, again in company with &quot;Sheffield&quot; and ten destroyers, landed an advance force of Royal Marines at Namsos to seize and secure the wharves and approaches to the town, preparatory to the landing of a larger Allied force. On 23 April &quot;Glasgow&quot;, &quot;Sheffield&quot;, and six destroyers landed the first part of the 15th Infantry Brigade in Åndalsnes. On 29 April, she evacuated King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav of Norway, Nygaardsvold&#x27;s Cabinet and part of the Norwegian gold reserves when they fled from Molde to Tromsø, escaping the advancing German forces. She then departed to the United Kingdom on 1 May, carrying among others the Minister of Foreign Affairs Halvdan Koht and the Minister of Defence Birger Ljungberg.

===Mediterranean service===

Whilst operating in home waters after the withdrawal from Norway, &quot;Glasgow&quot; accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer in thick fog off Duncansby Head on 16 July 1940. &quot;Glasgow&quot; was able to rescue the majority of the destroyer&#x27;s crew but unfortunately 19 lost their lives as well as two crew members of &quot;Glasgow&quot;.

Following repairs &quot;Glasgow&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean where she was employed as a convoy escort and as a reinforcement of the 3rd Cruiser Squadron based at Alexandria. She took part in the Fleet Air Arm raid that crippled the Italian Fleet at Taranto; on 14 November, &quot;Glasgow&quot;, along with , and , landed 3,400 troops from Alexandria in Piraeus. On 26 November, &quot;Glasgow&quot;, and &quot;York&quot; escorted a supply convoy from Alexandria to Malta.

On 3 December &quot;Glasgow&quot; was attacked by Italian aircraft while anchored in Suda Bay, Crete. She was hit by two torpedoes fired by a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 flown by Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia. The torpedoes struck far forward and aft, the latter putting two of her propeller shafts out of service. Other than that she received only moderate damage. She was able to return to Alexandria, where as the shipyard did not have the resources and capability to make a full repair, she was repaired to a level that allowed her to return to secondary duties. During this period she was temporarily replaced by .

===Far East service===

As a result of her diminished capability &quot;Glasgow&quot; was allocated to the Indian Ocean, leaving Alexandria on 12 February 1941 and passing through the Suez Canal. On 18 February she joined East Indies Fleet at Aden. In February the sank the freighters &quot;Canadian Cruiser&quot; and &quot;Rantaupandjang&quot; in the Indian Ocean. Both managed to transmit distress signals, that were picked up by &quot;Glasgow&quot;, which deployed in search of the German ship. On 22 January, &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; was sighted by the spotter aircraft from &quot;Glasgow&quot;, the East Indies Task Force was deployed to the reported area. However, &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; had escaped by turning away to the southeast and further searches were in vain. In March &quot;Glasgow&quot;, in company with , two auxiliary cruisers, two destroyers and two anti-submarine trawlers of the Indian Navy, escorted two troop transport vessels containing two Indian Battalions and one Somali commando detachment, who were landed on either side of Berbera, in Somaliland, which had previously been occupied by the Italians. The town was taken after only slight Italian resistance, which was soon broken by naval gunfire from &quot;Glasgow&quot; and the other escorts.

At midnight on 9 December 1941, &quot;Glasgow&quot; sank the RIN patrol vessel HMIS &quot;Prabhavati&quot; with two lighters in tow &quot;en route&quot; to Karachi, with 6-inch shells at . &quot;Prabhavati&quot; was alongside the lighters and was mistaken for a surfaced Japanese submarine. &quot;Glasgow&quot; picked up the survivors and took them to Bombay, arriving there later that day.

On 19 March 1942, &quot;Glasgow&quot; escorted convoy WS-16 from the UK to South Africa. In April &quot;Glasgow&quot; again underwent temporary repairs, this time in Simonstown, South Africa. She subsequently sailed to the US for permanent repairs at the Brooklyn Navy Yard from 6 May onwards. As well as repairing the damage from her 1940 torpedo attack, additional 20 mm Oerlikon cannons were added to improve her close range anti-aircraft capability. It was also decided to improve her radar suite by replacing her existing Type 286M radar with the new Type 271, while a Type 284 fire-control radar to control her main armament, type 285 and 282 aircraft warning fire-control and Type 281 aircraft warning radars were installed.

Following the completion of her shipyard work, she returned to the UK in August to complete work on her radar installations at Portsmouth. On 3 September she joined the 10th Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow where she was assigned to covering forces for the Arctic convoys.

=== In the Arctic and home waters ===
&quot;Glasgow&quot; escorted Arctic convoys between January and February 1943. In March she intercepted the German blockade runner &quot;Regensburg&quot; in the Denmark Strait as it returned from the Far East with valuable rubber, tungsten and other commodities. Her crew managed to scuttle the ship, but most of the crew drowned in the heavy seas while abandoning her, with &quot;Glasgow&quot; being able to recover only six survivors. During June and July she supplied cover for escort groups in the Bay of Biscay.

Between August and September she entered the HM Dockyard at Devonport where her aircraft facilities were removed and more 20 mm weapons were installed to improve her air defences. She received a new Fire-Control Type 283. The opportunity was also taken to install IFF equipment and VHF radio-telephone outfits. Upon completion of her refit she was transferred to join the Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth. On 26 October she took to sea the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham to undertake the interment of the ashes of Admiral Sir Dudley Pound and his late wife in the Solent, off Nab Tower.

In December 1943 she formed part of Operation Stonewall, the interception of German blockade runners. In late December, &quot;Glasgow&quot; and the cruiser in the Battle of the Bay of Biscay fought a three-hour battle with eleven German destroyers and torpedo boats of which three were sunk and four damaged by gunfire. After this engagement &quot;Glasgow&quot; returned to Plymouth in spite of several air attacks where glider bombs were used.

On 6 June 1944 &quot;Glasgow&quot; was part of Operation Neptune, (the Normandy landings). Along with the battleships and , the French cruisers and , nine US destroyers and three s, she made up the Gunfire Bombardment Support Force C for Omaha Beach. On 25–26 June, in support of the attack by the 7th US Corps on Cherbourg, she conducted the Bombardment of Cherbourg shelled German artillery batteries near Querqueville. During this exchange of fire &quot;Glasgow&quot; was hit and damaged. In August 1945 she set sail for the East Indies, where she was the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief.

=== Modernisation ===

With the demand for cruisers in the European theatre decreasing it was decided to withdraw &quot;Glasgow&quot; and modernise her in preparation for the ongoing war in the Pacific. Entering a shipyard on the River Tyne on 3 July 1944 her aft 6-inch turret (&#x27;X&#x27;) was removed to compensate for the additional weight of adding the more powerful anti-aircraft armament needed to counter the threat of kamikaze attacks. The space freed by the removal of the aft turret was used to mount two quad 40 mm Bofors guns. New radar systems were fitted including a single aerial air warning Type 281B (which replaced an earlier twin mast Type 281), a surface warning Type 293 (which replaced the existing Type 273), while the main armament&#x27;s Type 284 gunnery radar was replaced by a Type 274. She was also fitted with a US made YE homing beacon to help her undertake the high risk role of a radar picket. The beacon issued coded directions to Allied aircraft returning from missions, which would allow &quot;Glasgow&quot; to be stationed on an outer screen around the main fleet to separate Allied aircraft from accompanying enemy aircraft and so destroy enemy aircraft before they reached the fleet. The modernisation was completed on 29 June 1945. She then spent July working up for operational war service.

=== Postwar ===

On 22 August 1945 &quot;Glasgow&quot; set out with HMS &quot;Jamaica&quot; for the East Indies as acting flagship. She transferred to the Indian Ocean arriving in Colombo on 5 October to relieve HMS &quot;Phoebe&quot; as the flagship of 5th Cruiser Squadron. After serving for two years in the Indian Ocean &quot;Glasgow&quot; returned to Portsmouth and was placed in the Reserve. Following a refit she was re-commissioned in September 1948 and on 26 October, 1948, &quot;Glasgow&quot; replaced HMS Sheffield at her new base, the Royal Naval Dockyard in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, as the flagship on the America and West Indies Station. She attended the Halifax bicentenary celebrations in Nova Scotia in 1949, returning to the UK in October 1950.

She was then refitted at Chatham in 1951 before becoming in 1952 the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet based at Malta under Admiral the Earl Mountbatten of Burma. In 1953, she took part in the film &quot;Sailor of the King&quot;. In the same year she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

Together with , HMS &quot;Bermuda&quot;, HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;, seven destroyers and two frigates she escorted Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh on board the royal yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; at the end of their world tour to Malta where they arrived on 2 May 1954. She was still in the Mediterranean Fleet when together with HMS &quot;Gambia&quot; she participated in August 1954 in the withdrawal of 40 Commando Royal Marines from Port Said.

In 1955 &quot;Glasgow&quot; returned to the UK, and in May 1955 onwards rejoined the Home Fleet as flagship of the Flag Officer D (Flotillas) before being paid off at Portsmouth in November 1956. The Suez crisis in 1956 caused &quot;Glasgow&quot; to be temporarily re-commissioned.

=== Decommissioning and disposal ===
After the Suez Crisis it was decided that &quot;Glasgow&quot; was surplus to requirements and was paid off in November 1956. The warship was placed on the disposal list in March 1958 and was sold to BISCO for demolition. Departing Portsmouth on 4 July &quot;Glasgow&quot; arrived under tow on 8 July at Hughes Bolckow&#x27;s yard in Blyth for breaking up.

<text>Wolfram Karl Ludwig Moritz Hermann Freiherr von Richthofen (10 October 1895 – 12 July 1945) was a German World War I flying ace who rose to the rank of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) in the Luftwaffe during World War II.

In the First World War, Richthofen fought on the Western and Eastern Fronts as a cavalry officer until 1917. He joined the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; (German Imperial Air Service) after his cousins, brothers Lothar and Manfred (&#x27;The Red Baron&#x27;), both of whom became flying aces. On his first mission in &quot;Jagdgeschwader 1&quot; (Fighter Wing 1), Manfred was killed while chasing a fighter that attacked Wolfram. Wolfram went on to claim eight aerial victories before the armistice in November 1918. After the war, Richthofen joined the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and became a member of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; after Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933. He served as part of the &quot;Condor Legion&quot; which supported the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. During this time, he recognised the need for close air support in military campaigns and championed the dive bomber. He also made innovations in ground-air communications.

When the Second World War broke out, Richthofen commanded a specialised ground-attack air unit, &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; (8th Air Corps), first as a small active service unit in the Polish Campaign, and then as a full-sized Air Corps in Western Europe, from May to June 1940. His unit proved to be decisive at certain points in the French Campaign, particularly covering the German thrust to the English Channel. He continued to command air units in the Battle of Britain and the Balkans Campaign in 1940 and 1941. Richthofen achieved his greatest success on the Eastern Front. In particular, the Crimean Campaigns of 1942, where his forces offered vital tactical and operational support to Army Group South. Afterwards he commanded Luftwaffe forces in the Italian Campaign before retiring in late 1944 on medical grounds. Richthofen died in July 1945 of a brain tumour while in American captivity.

Richthofen&#x27;s reputation, according to his biographer, James Corum, was of a competent but ruthless practitioner of air power. Richthofen is not considered a war criminal for his command of air forces, but he knew of the German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war, and was marginally involved in disseminating orders pertaining to their treatment—though the Luftwaffe in general had only partial responsibility for them.
==Early life==
Richthofen was born on 10 October 1895, at the Richthofen Barzdorf (now Bartoszówek, Poland) estate (&quot;Gut Barzdorf&quot;), near Striegau (Strzegom), Lower Silesia to an aristocratic family. His father, Wolfram Freiherr von Richthofen (1856–1922), and mother, Therese Gotz von Olenhusen (1862–1948) were of the Silesian nobility, and the family had been ennobled 350 years before Wolfram&#x27;s birth.

Richthofen was the second child and oldest son of four children. His older sister, Sophie-Therese, was born in 1891 (and died in 1971). His brother Manfred was born in 1898 and Gerhard in 1902. He was the fourth cousin of the German World War I flying ace Manfred von Richthofen, popularly known as the &quot;Red Baron&quot;, and the baron&#x27;s younger brother Lothar von Richthofen. As the son of a nobleman, he enjoyed a life of privilege. The family&#x27;s noble status dated back to the 1500s, and by the 1700s the Richthofens owned 16 estates in Lower Silesia. When Frederick the Great annexed Silesia in 1740, he personally granted the title of Baron (Freiherr) to one of Richthofen&#x27;s direct ancestors. The family remained in Silesia for a further three generations.

Richthofen&#x27;s home, an eighteenth-century estate, was only one of 25 Richthofen-owned properties totalling . Barzdorf, where he lived, was a modest , of which 269 was farmed and the rest was forest. Wolfram, as the oldest son did not inherit the estate. Instead, on the death of his father in 1922, it was given to his younger brother, Manfred. Some years before, Wolfram&#x27;s uncle General of Cavalry Manfred von Richthofen, his father&#x27;s brother, had asked him to inherit his estate to keep it in the family, as he himself had no children. Wolfram inherited the estate after Manfred legally adopted him. The general died in 1939.

He had a distant relationship with his youngest brother, but a close one with Manfred. Unlike most Prussian nobles Wolfram von Richthofen went to the local Gymnasium (academic high school) and did not have private tutors at home. He attended school in Striegau. His grades in mathematics and German language were good, but he did not excel at foreign languages (in which he scored average to poor results). He found studying language to be boring, but did learn Italian and could converse competently in it in later life.

He became a close friend of his cousins, Lothar and Manfred von Richthofen, and hunted game at the estate with them regularly. By the end of his teens, he had become an established hunter and horse rider – interests which remained with him for the rest of his life. He enjoyed being outdoors and, while still at school, opted to apply for a commission in the German Army (rather than choose an academic career).

In 1913, at the age of 18, he joined the army and took the officer course in Berlin. The Cavalry was the most prestigious arm, and he applied to join the 4th Hussars which belonged to the 12th Cavalry Brigade of the Sixth Army Corps in Breslau. He did not have much time to experience peacetime military service. In August 1914 the First World War began. He completed flight training in the fall of 1917 and in the spring of 1918 joined Jagdgeschwader 11, his cousin Baron Manfred von Richthofen&#x27;s new command. It was 21 April 1918 that Wolfram was attacked by British planes while on patrol with his squadron; Manfred von Richthofen was killed in the same action the same day.

On 18 September 1920, he married Jutta von Selchow (March 1896 – 1991) at a Lutheran church in Breslau (now the city of Wrocław in Poland). They had been introduced by her brother Gunther. Jutta was also of Silesian nobility, and had moved in the same circles. She had served as a nurse in the war. They lived in an apartment in Hanover while Wolfram restarted his academic career in Engineering. During their marriage they rarely traveled abroad in the 1920s. In the 1930s they took skiing holidays in Switzerland. The couple had three children; Wolfram (born 25 May 1922), Götz (27 November 1925) and Ellen (15 February 1928). Wolfram was posted missing in action over northern Romania on 5 June 1944. He was never found.

==First World War==

The Hussars of the 12th Cavalry Brigade were attached to the 5th Cavalry Division, which was part of the First Cavalry Corps. It formed part of the German Third Army which carried out the attack on France and Belgium in August 1914 as part of the long-prepared Schlieffen Plan. Richthofen crossed the Meuse at Dinant, and his unit was involved in heavy action against the French VIII Cavalry Corps. It fought in Belgium at Namur on 23–24 August during the siege of the city and again at Saint-Quentin. The 5th Cavalry continued its drive into France after the Battle of the Frontiers, but was stopped at the First Battle of the Marne in September. In recognition for bravery in combat, Richthofen was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class () on 21 September 1914. The new combat environment of trench warfare greatly lessened the effectiveness of cavalry, so Richthofen&#x27;s division was transferred to the Eastern Front, arriving in Poland in November 1915.

On the Eastern Front, the Cavalry Division was mostly deployed in the south. It saw little fighting, as the German army did not use cavalry frequently, and the division was kept mainly in reserve. Richthofen&#x27;s brigade served near Pinsk in 1916, and the division would spend late 1915 to January 1917 on defensive duties in the Pripet Marshes. Richthofen was given command of the horse depot of the Brigade in the autumn of 1916 and was promoted to Squadron Commander, with 160 men under his command. This was never going to garner him the level of fame his cousins, Lothar and Manfred, were now achieving in the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; (Imperial Air Service), and they personally encouraged him to transfer to the air service, which he finally did in June 1917.

===&quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot;===

Before he joined the Air Service, Richthofen was given leave in Germany until he reported to the 14th Flying Replacement Regiment based at Halle, one of several large flight schools. At this point in the war, German training was more thorough and longer than that of the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and at least equal to that of the French Air Force and the United States Army Air Service (USAAS). His training lasted three months, and he was assigned to the 11th Flying Replacement Battalion for advanced training in March 1918.

On 4 April 1918, Richthofen was assigned to &quot;Jagdgeschwader 1&quot;, commanded by his cousin Manfred von Richthofen. On 21 April, Wolfram flew his first mission. As he was a new pilot, Manfred instructed him to avoid the fighting. When the squadron became engaged in a dogfight, Wolfram climbed and circled above the fray. RAF Lieutenant Wilfred May, also a new pilot, was also circling above the dogfight. He attacked and pursued Richtofen. On seeing his cousin being attacked, Manfred flew to his rescue and fired on May, causing him to pull away and saving Wolfram&#x27;s life. Richthofen pursued May across the Somme. It was in this pursuit that Manfred was killed in action.

Wolfram continued flying and went on to claim eight aerial victories in the Fokker D.VII before the armistice ended the war on 11 November 1918.

==Luftwaffe==
Richthofen studied aeronautical engineering from 1919 to 1922 at the Technische Hochschule in Hanover. He served in Rome between 1929 and 1931 as an &quot;informal&quot; air attache, in violation of the disarmament clauses of the Versailles Treaty. Richthofen gained a Ph.D. in the subject.

In 1933 Richthofen joined the Luftwaffe, which was commanded by his former commanding officer at JG 1, in 1918, Hermann Göring. By 1934 he was in charge of developing and testing new aircraft in the &quot;Technisches Amt&quot;, or Technical Service, under the overall direction of Ernst Udet. Although Richthofen had known Göring, having served under him in the First World War in JG 1, the two did not get along. They both came from aristocratic backgrounds, but Richthofen was a Silesian from Lower Silesia, a driven commander, and a good and hard working staff officer who enjoyed the company of engineers and like-minded men, while Göring was a Bavarian and a playboy who enjoyed talking about the First World War and his time as an ace and particularly enjoyed the trappings of power. Göring preferred men like himself, and promoted them on that basis. He passed over the more highly qualified Richthofen in favour of Udet, a hard drinker and playboy, who like Göring had grown up in Bavaria, to head the &quot;Technisches Amt&quot;.

Richthofen&#x27;s role was mainly concerned with aircraft procurement programs for the fledgling Luftwaffe. He was involved in the development of types such as the Dornier Do 23, Heinkel He 111 and Junkers Ju 86. In the event, only the He 111 would make a real impact during the war. Richthofen was following a considerably difficult assignment, stemming from a directive issued to the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; before Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. In July 1932, the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; had been pursuing the &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; (fast bomber) concept. The need for modern and fast bombers was to meet the future vision of air warfare for bombers that were faster than fighter aircraft. These concepts became even more important when Hitler seized power and issued demands for rapid rearmament.

As the 1930s progressed the He 111 was refined, and the Dornier Do 17 &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; entered planning, production and service in 1936–37. Even so, Göring was still interested in the heavy bomber program, which would give the Luftwaffe a firm strategic bombing capability. Richthofen was dubious about the employment of heavy bombers, and wanted the projects developing types like the Dornier Do 19 cancelled. Unfortunately for Richthofen, for the time being, the Luftwaffe″s first Chief of the General Staff, Walter Wever, did believe in the heavy bomber program. The development of what Wever called the &quot;Ural bomber&quot; designs continued. At the time, Göring and Wever also required a long-range fighter escort design for protecting the bombers over Britain and the Soviet Union, Germany&#x27;s expected enemies. Richthofen joined Wever in moderating some of the design requests made by Göring, who insisted on a fast, fighter, bomber, ground attack and reconnaissance aircraft rolled into one design. Viewing the request as impossible, Richthofen used his position to split the specification into separate designs on 22 January 1935.

Wever was killed in an air accident in June 1936, and the emphasis shifted back to more economical (in manpower and material terms) medium bombers. After Wever&#x27;s death, Göring and Ernst Udet became more active in the development programs. Udet favoured the close support designs, such as the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bomber, while Göring favoured having more medium bombers rather than a small number of heavy bombers. Richthofen did not get along with Udet, and did not believe in his ideas about dive bombing. Udet, much like Göring, favoured combining the qualities of aircraft. Udet sought out a design that could dog fight, dive bomb and carry out level bombing, much like Göring had requested. This was at odds with Richthofen&#x27;s fundamental desire for aircraft that were easy to mass-produce and were designed to excel at specialised tasks.

Although Richthofen had managed to prevent aircraft design from heading into mediocrity, and had kept them specialised for particular tasks, Udet still influenced the selection of the multi-purpose Messerschmitt Bf 110 and the &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; (fast bomber) designed Junkers Ju 88 by the end of 1936. With the Ju 88, he insisted it should have a dive bombing capability, although it was more suited to, and ideal for, the level bombing &quot;Schnellbomber&quot; concept. By the autumn, 1936, Richthofen decided he had had enough of working with Udet, whose ideas he thought were totally wrong. With an expanding Luftwaffe and a civil war starting in Spain, an opportunity came for a field command.

==Spanish Civil War==
In November 1936, Richthofen left the Technical Service staff to take a field command in the &quot;Condor Legion&quot;, a Luftwaffe contingent sent to support General Francisco Franco&#x27;s Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. Udet continued with the dive bomber concept and the Ju 87 first saw action under Richthofen&#x27;s command in Spain. Wolfram retained his position as Head of Development, but he was now tasked with the evaluation of aircraft under operational conditions. His role expanded in January 1937, and he became Chief of Staff to Hugo Sperrle, who was to command the &quot;Legion&quot;.
===Tactical aviation===
Richthofen&#x27;s experiences were to serve the Luftwaffe well in the long-term and he was leading proponent of army support aviation at this time. His own learning curve in the war highlighted several issues that a modern air force would have to overcome. The most important issues concerned tactical and operational level warfare. The Germans put a great deal of effort into developing close air support doctrine in the late 1930s. Tactically, Richthofen found little need to retain anti-aircraft artillery to defend airfields. He pushed &quot;Flak&quot; units into the frontline to bolster the artillery units. Rapid fire 20 mm calibres and 88 mm weapons were first used in Spain and their effectiveness was reported to Berlin. Soon this tactic became part of Luftwaffe doctrine.

Another tactical consideration led to operational innovation. Richthofen adopted the shuttle air tactic. In order to maximise support over the frontline, aircraft operated from bases near the front to keep and gain an advantage. It was very successful in the 1937 battles. Aircraft were sent in small formations to bomb frontline positions, while other groups of ground attack aircraft were en route and refuelling. This way a constant air presence was maintained over the battlefield, which eroded the effectiveness and morale of the enemy. In order for this to be able to work effectively, three or more sorties needed to be flown per day. This required a large number of personnel to set up and man forward airfields. At the operational level, the Luftwaffe″s logistics units had to be completely motorised to bring in fuel, ammunition and spare parts. These units had the opportunity to be tested under tough operational conditions. The experience in Spain had shown air transport units were invaluable to logistics, and with Richthofen&#x27;s input, were expanded accordingly. By 1939, the Luftwaffe would have the largest, and most capable transport service in the World.

Richthofen employed these learned tactics and operational methods during the Battle of Bilbao. The motorised logistics also helped during the rapid redeployment to the south, after the surprise Republican offensive at Brunete in July 1937. Air support was vital in defeating the offensive, which was supported by modern aircraft sent to the Republicans from the Soviet Union. German types like the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter, which replaced the Heinkel He 51, Do 17 and He 111, helped win and hold air superiority and interdict the battlefield. The Republicans had spent most of their gold reserves on buying Soviet equipment. With most of that equipment used up, the Condor Legion and Nationalists gained the technological edge.

The Spanish experience began a late surge of interest in close support aircraft within the Luftwaffe. In the first years of the Nazi state, these types had remained a low-priority for air planners who shaped the embryonic Luftwaffe. This apparent regression from the practices and experiences of World War I stemmed from the belief among the General Staff (&quot;Oberkommando der Luftwaffe&quot;) that army support aviation in 1917–1918 was purely a reaction to trench warfare. The German &quot;Heer&quot; also did not insist that the Luftwaffe change its approach at this time. German air doctrine remained rooted in the fundamentals of &quot;Operativer Luftkrieg&quot; (Operational Air War) which stressed interdiction, Strategic bombing (when and if possible) but primarily the air supremacy mission. The Spanish experience encouraged the General Staff to embrace the dive-bomber concept, for which Richthofen was partly responsible, but the influence of the conflict on German operational preferences remain ambiguous. On the eve of World War II, some German air planners regarded the dive-bomber as a strategic weapon to strike with precision at enemy industry. Even factored into the army support groups, only fifteen percent of Luftwaffe front-line strength contained specialist ground-attack aircraft in September 1939.

===Operational experience===
The most difficult aspect of close support was communication. Air-ground liaison officers had been used since 1935, when the Luftwaffe first set up a training program for this purpose. By 1937, precise procedures had yet to be worked through for air to ground coordination. Staff officers were trained to solve operational problems, and the lack of doctrine and reluctance of the &quot;Oberkommando der Luftwaffe&quot; (OKL = High Command of the Air Force) to micromanage gave Sperrle and Richthofen a free hand to devise solutions. Aircraft could not communicate with the frontline. Instead, they could communicate via radio with each other and their home base. One of the first innovations was to prepare signals staff on the frontline in the region of any planned air strikes, and equip them with telephones. The forward officers could telephone the base with updates, who in turn could radio the aircraft. It became an important standard operational practice. Liaison officers were attached to the Nationalist Army, and improved coordination continued in the second half of 1937 despite occasional friendly-fire incidents. In the Second World War, the Luftwaffe air units and liaison officers at the front could communicate directly, with updated radios.

The Luftwaffe entered the Second World War with high standards of training. Although other air forces also had training programs and pilots equal to the Germans, the Luftwaffe emphasised training its large units, the &quot;Geschwader&quot; (Wings), Corps and &quot;Luftflotten&quot; (Air Fleet) staffs in large-scale manoeuvres with the army in the pre-war years. War games and communication exercises in a variety of different combat operations allowed the officers to familiarise themselves with mobile warfare, and this produced proficient doctrine and better prepared operational methods than most of its opponents had. With notable exceptions, such as RAF Fighter Command, most of the Allied air forces did not conduct large-scale unit and staff exercises, testing tactics and doctrine. Given the slight numerical and technological advantage of the Luftwaffe over its enemies in 1939–1941, its success during these years can largely be attributed to extensive officer and staff training programs along with the experiences of the Condor Legion in Spain.

Richthofen and Sperrle made an effective team in Spain. Sperrle was an experienced officer and was intelligent with a good reputation. Richthofen was considered a good leader in combat. They combined to advise and oppose Franco on a number of topics to prevent the misuse of air power, and debates were heated. Both German men were blunt with the Spanish leader, and although the Germans and Spanish did not like each other, they had a healthy respect which translated into an effective working relationship. Richthofen even learned a little Spanish and Italian, an effort appreciated by the Nationalist officers.

After Sperrle returned to Germany, Richthofen assumed command of the &quot;Condor Legion&quot;. Hellmuth Volkmann assumed his place, but his pessimistic reports to Berlin, his continued demands for support and resources, and his personal disagreements with Richthofen forced his replacement in October 1938. Richthofen was promoted to the rank of Generalmajor on 1 November 1938, and he oversaw the final stages of the civil war in early 1939. By this time, his belief in the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; was cemented. It had proved highly successful in its limited role, and Richthofens&#x27;s fear of excessive losses in low-level ground attack operations proved ill-founded.

===Guernica controversy===
During the Spanish Civil War, the &quot;Condor Legion&quot; bombed Guernica. Beginning soon afterward and continuing today, historians saw the attack as a deliberate act of terror bombing designed to break civilian morale. In April 1937 the town was located just behind the Republican frontline and Nationalist forces were applying pressure in the area. One possible reason for Richthofen sanctioning the bombing was that two main roads being used to supply 23 Basque battalions at Bilbao intersected at Guernica. At least the 18th Loyola and Saseta battalions were stationed in the city at the time, making it a legitimate target. The destruction of the road and train lines around Guernica, as well as the bridges, denied the Republicans an escape route as well as their only way to evacuate heavy equipment.

Some accounts of the raid, including defenses proffered after the fact by Condor Legion veterans, argued that the &quot;poor accuracy&quot; of German bomb sights in early 1937 was responsible for the carnage caused by the attack. Some facts suggest otherwise, however, fueling speculation that the raid was one of Richthofen&#x27;s experiments in air warfare tactics. The Condor Legion had made systematic twenty-minute relays above the town over the course of two-and-a-half hours. Loads included anti-personnel twenty-pound bombs and incendiaries dropped in aluminum tubes that set fleeing livestock and humans alight with white phosphorus. Blackened bodies lay curled in the town square and streets and buried in the rubble of their homes. Current estimates from basque historians put the number of killed in 153. Historians have pointed out that the key Renteria bridge just outside the town was never hit in the raid, that the attacking Condor Legion Junkers flew abreast over the town and not in line as they would to fell a bridge, and that anti-personnel bombs, incendiaries and machine gun bullets would not have been effective against stone structures like the Renteria bridge. &quot;Guernica burning,&quot; Richthofen wrote in his war diary the day of the attack. Two days later he speculated that the town &quot;must be totally destroyed.&quot;

By the 1937 rules of international warfare, Guernica was a legitimate target – a green light, in effect, for the air-war horrors to come. Richthofen had planned and executed the attack with the approval of the Spanish Nationalists. From a purely military perspective, it was a success, closing the city to traffic for 24 hours. A &quot;technical success,&quot; Richthofen called it, disappointed that the Nationalists failed to follow it up quickly and so missed a chance to cut off large portions of the enemy forces.

==World War II==

Richthofen commanded &quot;Fliegerführer z.b.V.&quot; (&quot;zur besonderen Verwendung&quot;—for special deployment) during the invasion of Poland, which began on 1 September 1939, quickly triggering the war in Europe. This unit was a tactical formation and was attached to 2nd &quot;Fliegerdivision&quot;, under the joint command of Bruno Loerzer and Alexander Löhr. The operational goal of &quot;Fliegerführer z.b.V.&quot;, was to support the 10th Army, under the command of Walter von Reichenau. The army contained the majority of the motorised and armoured units and was to form the focal point, or &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot;, of the offensive against Poland.

Richthofen&#x27;s order of battle included a powerful concentration of strike aircraft. The formation had its headquarters at Birkental-Oppeln, but its units were spread out. Schlosswalden was home to 1.(F)/&quot;AufklGr&quot; (&quot;Aufklärungsgruppe&quot;—reconnaissance group) 124, which operated Dornier Do 17P aircraft. &quot;Lehrgeschwader&quot; 2 (Learning Wing 2), was based at Nieder-Ellguth, while the bulk of &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; 77 (Dive Bombing Wing 77 or StG 77), which operated the Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot;, was based at Neudorf. Richthofen also commanded the Slovak Air Force units (&quot;Slovenske Vzousne Zbrane&quot;), the 38th and 48th Fighter Squadrons, and the 16th Corps Squadron.

===Invasion of Poland===
On the first day of the offensive StG 77 was committed to counter-air operations, striking Polish Air Force (PAF) bases. The need for counter-air operations left only II.(&quot;Schlacht&quot;)/&quot;LG&quot; 2 for close support operations. The unit supported the German mechanised XVI Army Corps. Along with other units, Richthofen&#x27;s &quot;I./StG 77&quot; decimated a cavalry brigade of the Polish &quot;Armii Łódź&quot; during the Battle of Łódź.

Only eight days into the campaign, on 8 September, the Tenth Army had advanced so far into Poland, that Richthofen was obliged to move Günter Schwartzkopff, his most experienced dive-bomber exponent, into Polish airfields, while Reichenau closed in on Warsaw. Richthofen was able to keep logistical elements functioning, which kept units flying three sorties per day. At the end of the first week of September, Richthofen&#x27;s battle group was transferred to &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4 (Air Fleet 4).

The fast moving frontline caused army headquarters to lose touch with its forward units. The collapse of communications deprived commanders and squadrons of orders, a situation exacerbated by the lack of a common radio frequency and by over-stretched logistics, which also forced them to scavenge enemy supply depots. Richthofen was the most affected. As early as 3 September, he noted in his diary that the army headquarters had ceased to know where the frontline was, and he refused to respond to army requests for air support. Instead, he responded according to his own interpretation of the situation. This method did cause friendly fire incidents. On one occasion, Ju 87s knocked out a bridge across the Vistula river when a Panzer Division was about to cross.

The air-ground coordination was the responsibility of &quot;Kolufts&quot;, who synthesised data from their own aerial reconnaissance and forward units, but they were only advisers and had little experience in air warfare. They were controlled by the army staffs (&quot;Nahaufklarungsstaffeln&quot;) and depended on the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Air Liaison Officer (&quot;Fliegerverbindungsstaffeln&quot; or &quot;Flivo&quot;) for fighter or bomber support. However, &quot;Flivo&quot; units were responsible to the Luftwaffe, not the army, and their role was to keep air commanders informed of the situation through the use of radio-equipped vehicles.
Loerzer was out of contact with Reichenau&#x27;s command post for three days, while Richthofen was soon complaining to Löhr about the former&#x27;s ignorance. Because he was impetuous and wanted to be in the thick of the action, Richthofen began flying around over the frontline in a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch, as air-ground liaison collapsed. His claims were not always believed, and these personal operations were a waste of time and needlessly exposed him to danger. Indeed, Major Spielvogel was shot down over Warsaw in his &quot;Storch&quot; on 9 September, and killed. While the operational situation was not good, Löhr took command of &quot;Fliegerführer z.b.V.&quot;, giving the unit virtual autonomy and allowing Richthofen to build a personal empire of six &quot;Gruppen&quot; (Groups).

By 11 September, the fuel situation was acute, and logistics failed. On the first day his units were flying three missions every day, now it was reduced to one per day. Despite the problems, by 8 September Richthofen was preparing an assault on Warsaw. The raids had barely begun when a major threat developed behind him. A Polish counter offensive engaged the German Eighth Army, in an attempt to reach the Vistula river. Richthofen joined the assault and counterattack from the air. For three days the Germans bombed Polish forces contributing to the success in the Battle of Radom and Battle of the Bzura. Richthofen sent his air units up under orders to spend only ten minutes over the battlefield, and to expend all ammunition. Polish forces sought refuge in the forests nearby but were smoked out by incendiaries. Richthofen&#x27;s men flew 750 sorties and dropped 388 tons of bombs. The air action destroyed remaining resistance, allowing the army to defeat the remaining Polish forces.

The remaining threat from Polish forces generated calls for attacks on Warsaw. Air attacks against the city had been planned for the first day, codenamed &quot;Wasserkante&quot;, or Operation Seaside. Just after midnight on 12/13 September, the Luftwaffe chief of staff Hans Jeschonnek ordered Löhr to prepare to attack ghettos in northern Warsaw, in retaliation for unspecified war crimes against German soldiers in recent battles. Richthofen&#x27;s airmen flew 183 to 197 sorties, dropping equal quantities of high explosives and incendiaries. Some bombs fell close to German forces conducting the Siege of Warsaw and smoke made it impossible to assess damage. Richthofen confronted Hermann Göring over the need for a united air command for the Warsaw campaign and hinted he was the man for the job. He did not get his way until 21 September. Weather delayed the attack, which began on 22 September. That morning, Richthofen signaled the OKL; &quot;Urgently request exploitation of last opportunity for large experiment as devastation and terror raid&quot;, and added &quot;every effort will be made to completely eradicate Warsaw.&quot; The OKL rejected the proposal. Leaflets demanding the city&#x27;s surrender had been dropped on four days earlier, but Richthofen began acting on his own initiative, using Luftwaffe Directive 18, dated 21 September, which gave him responsibility for the conduct of air operations.

Richthofen did not get the aircraft he wanted for the operation, in particular the Heinkel He 111, and instead was handed old Junkers Ju 52 transports which delivered bombs by airmen throwing them out of the doors. His Ju 87s were also banned from using bomb loads greater than 50 kg. On 22 September, Richthofen&#x27;s command flew 620 sorties. German air units dropped 560 tonnes of high explosive and 72 tonnes of incendiaries. The bombing did great damage, causing 40,000 casualties and destroying one in ten of the buildings in the city, while only two Ju 87s and one Ju 52 were lost.

The army complained of near friendly fire incidents while fighting through the city and smoke made life difficult for the German artillery spotters. Hitler, despite the complaints, ordered the bombing to continue. Richthofen&#x27;s force also flew 450 sorties against Modlin Fortress, securing the town&#x27;s surrender on 27 September after 318 tonnes of bombs had been dropped on it in two days. Warsaw surrendered soon afterwards, and the campaign was declared over after the Polish surrender on 6 October 1939.

===Phoney War===

The invasion of Poland prompted both the United Kingdom and France to declare war on Germany. Originally, Richthofen&#x27;s force had retained its original name, &quot;Fliegerfuhrer zbV&quot;, after its transfer from Poland, but on 1 October it was renamed &quot;Fliegerdivision&quot; 8 (Flying Division 8), and some days later it was given Corps status. Richthofen was given command of the unit, now a specialist ground-attack Corps, VIII. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; (8th Flying Corps). Most of the &quot;Geschwader&quot; involved were based at Cologne and Düsseldorf. Included in the order of battle was &quot;Jagdgeschwader 27&quot; (JG 27), equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109s; KG 77, equipped with Dornier Do 17s; &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; 2 (StG 2) and StG 77, equipped with Ju 87 &quot;Stukas&quot;; and LG 2, equipped with Ju 87s, Bf 109s, Ju 88s and He 111s. The Corps was a purpose-built ground attack organisation. By 10 May, the order of battle had changed. Only one &quot;gruppe&quot; (group) of LG 2 remained, III.(Schlacht). IV.(St)./&quot;Lehrgeschwader&quot; 1 (LG 1), with Ju 87s were added, as was I.&quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; 76 (StG 76).

The task of Richthofen varied. He was to support Reichenau&#x27;s German Sixth Army in Belgium and Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist&#x27;s XXXXI and XIX Corps. During the Phoney War period, he established his headquarters at Koblenz on 18 October 1939, and thereafter his Corps steadily rose in strength, from 46 &quot;Staffeln&quot; (Squadrons), 27 of them Ju 87 units, to 59 by the end of the month. In December, he was first assigned to support Reichenau. Attacks on enemy air bases were only to be carried out if Allied air power attempted to interdict the German ground forces. Ground support was the first priority. This was reflected in &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII order of battle which contained six Ju 87 &quot;Gruppen&quot; (Groups, of 30 aircraft). &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; V had the primary counter-air role and was positioned close to the front to provide air superiority support. When a breakthrough took place, it was ordered to exchange airfields with &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII, to allow for effective air support to the army. However, the Corps&#x27; war diary and Richthofen&#x27;s personal diary make no mention of this order, which may indicate a breakdown in staff work at some level.

Operationally, the air division and corps headquarters were placed alongside, and moved with, army equivalents. The air liaison teams attached to the corps and Panzer Divisions were directed to report the battle situation at the front, but were forbidden to advise the army, or request air support. The army sent separate reports, under the same conditions. The reports were digested by Kleist and Richthofen&#x27;s chiefs of staff, and action was or was not taken with mutual agreement. Attack orders could be delivered in minutes to air units. A &quot;Gruppe&quot; (Group) of Ju 87s and Bf 109s was ready in reserve to respond, and could do so within 45 to 70 minutes. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII and Richthofen were led to believe they would spend the entire campaign supporting Reichenau in northern Belgium, but the OKL did not inform the Corps that it was going to be used in a Meuse breakthrough.

Richthofen knew Reichenau, and they had a close working relationship. During the planning for the Sixth Army&#x27;s operations, Reichenau seemed to display a lack of interest when the subject turned to the capture of the bridges at Maastricht, in the Netherlands, and Fort Eben-Emael in Belgium. The defeat and/or capture of these objectives were essential for the Sixth Army to advance into the Low Countries. So unenthusiastic was Reichenau about the suggested airborne operation by glider troops against the fort, that he refused to allow the diversion of any army artillery. Richthofen supplied a &quot;Flak&quot; battalion, &quot;Flakgruppe Aldinger&quot;, for the task of supporting them.

===Battle of France and Low Countries===
Richthofen found himself under pressure in other sectors on 10 May, the first day of the offensive. In the early phase of the Battle of the Netherlands, the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (paratrooper) forces had been tasked with capturing The Hague and the Dutch royal family. In the subsequent Battle for The Hague, German forces met heavy resistance. The Seventh Army advancing through Belgium and the Netherlands threatened German progress. Richthofen was ordered to throw in half of his force in the Hague battle and to attack the Scheldt estuary, near Antwerp, the Dutch border, to stop the French before they positioned themselves near the Moerdijk bridgehead. Despite thick cloud, German aircraft helped drive them back.

After the Dutch capitulation, Richthofen turned to support Reichenau in the Battle of Belgium. Richthofen provided close and interdiction support to the German Sixth Army, in particular, to the XVI Army Corps (Erich Hoepner). Twelve Ju 87s were lost; anti-aircraft fire accounted for six I./StG 76 machines. His support operations were usually ahead of the forward edge of the battlefield, with even reconnaissance aircraft pressed into service as bombers. Army units carried flares and Swastika flags to prevent friendly fire incidents. In the Battle of Hannut Richthofen&#x27;s forces proved effective against French armour. He also supported the German divisions a day or so later, at the Battle of the Gembloux Gap.

For the cost of twelve aircraft (four of them Ju 87s), he helped to attack French communication and supply positions, and supported Reichenau as he reached the Dyle river. He had moved into the Netherlands, to a hotel near Maastricht. He had a basic room, with a bath that did not work. In the afternoon, he received an order to cease operations in Belgium and send all he had to support the XLI Corps (Georg-Hans Reinhardt) north of Sedan. Richthofen was incredulous, and he had to move his entire infrastructure to the south. The failure of the OKL to inform him that he was to support the breakthrough is difficult to explain. He later noted in his diary that it was a major oversight for the OKL not to have informed him of his expected role but his diary also suggests he relished the fog of war. His forces were split between support for the advance in Belgium, while most were moved south. During the winding down of operations in the north, his units helped the sth Army capture Liege in Belgium on 17 May.

The most notable actions of his Corps took place during the Battle of Sedan. By this time, Richthofen had moved into St. Trond-Liege in Belgium. The German air attacks on French positions included 360 by his medium bombers, although his Ju 87 units could only fly 90 owing to the difficulties he had moving his Corps around. On 14 May JG 27 helped defend the bridgehead from Allied air attacks. Allied bomber strength was severely reduced. During the battle Richthofen suffered a blow when one of his experienced officers, Günter Schwartzkopff, was killed.

After the German breakthrough at Sedan, Richthofen asked that &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII be allowed to support Kleist to the sea. Richthofen convinced Göring to help press for the Panzers to continue, while his air Corps provided an aerial flank. His Ju 87s broke up attacks on the flanks of Army Group A, most notably combining to repulse the French 4h Armoured Division ( Charles de Gaulle) on 16 and 19 May, at the Battle of Montcornet and Crécy-sur-Serre that destroyed the French Ninth Army. Excellent ground-to-air communications were maintained throughout the campaign. Radio equipped forward liaison officers could call upon the &quot;Stukas&quot; and direct them to attack enemy positions along the axis of advance. In some cases the Luftwaffe responded to requests in 10–20 minutes. &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; Hans Seidemann (Richthofen&#x27;s Chief of Staff) said that &quot;never again was such a smoothly functioning system for discussing and planning joint operations achieved&quot;.

Richthofen moved his HQ to Ochamps to keep up with events, while he gambled on German air superiority holding out to fill forward airfields up with aircraft, which led to overcrowding. He also had communication difficulties, and flew around in his &quot;Storch&quot; to organise air support for the army. Hugo Sperrle, chief of &quot;Luftflotte 3&quot; (Air Fleet Three) arrived at the same HQ, disrupting staff work and leading Richthofen to explode with rage. The pressures compelled him to risk being shot down to pass on orders, and while flying on 22 May he was forced to land owing to a fractured fuel tank. He organised support for Reinhardt and covered Heinz Guderian&#x27;s Corps. While he complained about communication, by the standards of the day, it was efficient. The radio-equipped forward liaison officers assigned to &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; new targets, while leaving less important orders to land line officers. The Ju 87s were on 20-minute alert, and within 45 to 75 minutes they were diving onto their targets. In some cases, they were able to respond in 10 minutes. By 21 May, with his fighters based at Charleville-Mézières, Ju 87s at Sint-Truiden, and his Do 17s back in Germany, Richthofen&#x27;s logistics were overstretched and his fuel was running out.

By 21 May the Allied armies were encircled and counter-attacks had been repulsed at the Battle of Arras. The Allies were evacuating from Dunkirk. During the Battle of Dunkirk and Siege of Calais, Richthofen supported the advance of Army Groups A and B in these operations. Aircraft from his command frequently met Royal Air Force (RAF) fighters that had flown across the Channel. Richthofen noted that RAF Fighter Command and 11 Group in particular were responsible for 25 per cent of German losses. Richthofen helped capture Calais, and was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 23 May. Richthofen was ordered to support the 4th Army, though he showed little interest in the Dunkirk battles. He regarded them as a waste of time that disrupted preparations against southern France (Case Red). He believed the attempt to destroy Allied forces, or use of the Luftwaffe to prevent the evacuation, was unrealistic. Over Dunkirk, losses were severe and progress slow. On 26 May, Richthofen made a special effort to gain and hold air superiority. German air power failed to prevent the evacuation.

After the expulsion of the British Army and the surrenders of the Dutch and Belgians, Richthofen was ordered to support the German 9th Army, which included Guderian&#x27;s Corps. The battles were swift, the French lost their most capable formations in the encirclement, and they capitulated on 22 June 1940, after the capture of Paris on 14 June and the encirclement of the Maginot Line on 15 June.

===Battle of Britain===
After the French capitulation, Richthofen continued to command &quot;VIII. Fliegerkorps&quot; during the Battle of Britain. The British refusal to reach a compromise with Germany forced the OKL to prepare a plan for attaining air superiority, codenamed Operation Eagle Attack. If this had been successful, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; might have launched an invasion of Britain, codenamed Operation Sea Lion.

For the first time, the Luftwaffe was engaged in an offensive air war without the support of the German Army. Despite Richthofen&#x27;s Corps being primarily a specialist ground assault organisation, which supported ground forces, he was expected to help lead the assault over Britain. His &quot;Stuka&quot; units were the best precision attack aircraft in the Luftwaffe, and their 500 kg bombs were capable of sinking merchant shipping and/or seriously damaging warships. In June 1940, Richthofen and his Corps&#x27; specific mission was to establish air superiority over the southern part of the English Channel (near France) and to clear British shipping from that strip of sea altogether, particularly from the region between Portsmouth and Portland. &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; had a particular advantage: British fighters did not have enough radar warning and were operating at the limits of their range. This gave his Ju 87s a near-free hand in operations.

In July 1940, skirmishes took place, between Albert Kesselring&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte 2&quot; and Hugo Sperrle&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte 3&quot; on one side, and RAF Air Vice Marshal Keith Park&#x27;s No. 11 Group RAF of Fighter Command on the other. The initial battles revolved around the British southern coast. Attempts by German air fleets to interdict British shipping in the English Channel were met with a significant response from the RAF, and many air battles ensued over the Channel. The Germans referred to these as &quot;Kanalkampf&quot; (&quot;the Channel battles&quot;). Richthofen made use of his Do 17P reconnaissance aircraft to locate convoys. When a convoy was located, he usually dispatched a &quot;Gruppe&quot; (30 aircraft) to engage the convoy, holding other &quot;Stuka&quot; &quot;Gruppen&quot; back for repeat attacks. The campaign was complicated by the weather, which grounded the Corps for long periods, and while the Ju 87s proved effective, they proved vulnerable to RAF fighters. On 17 July 1940, Richthofen was promoted to the rank of &quot;General der Flieger&quot; in recognition of his service.

Operations over the Channel were successful. Although Richthofen&#x27;s force severely over-claimed the number of ships sunk, they did succeed in forcing the Royal Navy to suspend convoys through the Channel temporarily, as well as forcing it to abandon Dover as a base. On 8 August 1940, during one of the last operations against shipping, his airmen claimed 48,500 tons of shipping sunk in one operation. The actual number was just 3,581 tons.

In mid-August, the Luftwaffe was ready to begin the main assault over the British mainland. The campaign opened on 13 August 1940, christened &quot;Adlertag&quot; (Eagle Day) by Hermann Göring. The entire day met with repeated German failures in communication, intelligence, and coordination. The objective of the raids, Fighter Command&#x27;s airfields, remained unscathed. Cloudy skies were largely responsible for the failure of the raids.

On 18 August, a large group of air battles led the day to be called &quot;The Hardest Day&quot;. On that day, Richthofen sent his units against airfields in southern England. Faulty intelligence meant all those hit by his units were unimportant. StG 77 struck at Fleet Air Arm bases, which had little to do with Fighter Command. In the process, the &quot;Geschwader&quot; took heavy losses.

Richthofen was not so much shocked by total Ju 87 losses, which were running at a bearable 15 per cent, assuming the raids were getting results and the battle short, but he was alarmed at the near destruction of an entire &quot;Gruppe&quot;, a loss rate which ran at 50 per cent. It required a rethink of the aircraft types to be used in the campaign. The Battle of Britain amounted to a defeat for the Ju 87. The Ju 87s were removed from the battle, and were limited to small-scale attacks on shipping until the spring, 1941, by which time the Battle of Britain was over and the air war over Britain (The Blitz) was winding down. Richthofen&#x27;s force flew 100 sorties in October, compared to the 100 per day in July 1940. In December 1940, &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; ended its Ju 87 operations and entered intensive winter training to be ready for the resumption of operations in the spring.

===Balkans Campaign===
In April 1941 &quot;VIII. Fliegerkorps&quot; was tasked with supporting the German invasion of Yugoslavia and the German Army in the Battle of Greece and the Battle of Crete. The failure of the Italian Army in the Greco-Italian War forced Hitler to intervene to secure the Axis flank, close to the Romanian oilfields. Operation Marita was expanded to involve the invasion of Greece and Yugoslavia.

Richthofen moved his units into Bulgaria via Romania. He found the country primitive, and resolved to improve the infrastructure, particularly communications, for the invasion of Yugoslavia. He intended to operate 120 aircraft from Bulgarian airfields and moved them into place on 1 March. While preparations were taking place he indulged in hunting and horse riding expeditions as a guest of the Bulgarian royal family. With Boris III of Bulgaria, he discussed dive-bombing techniques and the Corps&#x27; new aircraft, such as the Junkers Ju 88.

Richthofen&#x27;s Corps was given two wings of Ju 87s for the task; StG 2 and &quot;Sturzkampfgeschwader&quot; 3 (StG 3), based in Bulgaria. With reinforcements, the German air contingent, under &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4, would have a total of 946 combat aircraft supported by hundreds of transport machines. This force outnumbered the Greek, Yugoslav and RAF forces combined. Richthofen arranged to have the German Twelfth Army&#x27;s air reconnaissance units cooperate with his own formations through the use of a liaison. The Corps&#x27; operations supported the German Twelfth Army in southern Yugoslavia, which cut the Yugoslav Army off from Greece and the Allied forces there. The victory in Yugoslavia was complete with the bombing of Belgrade, which facilitated a rapid victory by destroying command and control centres.

Richthofen&#x27;s force did not participate in the bombing of Belgrade, but were engaged in attacking Yugoslav reinforcements, concentrated on the Austrian and Hungarian borders in the north, that were streaming south to block the break through. Mass columns of Yugoslav forces were caught in the open and decimated. The bombing of the capital disabled the command and control function of the Yugoslav Army, but it also convinced those in the government that further resistance would meet with even more destruction. Yugoslavia surrendered on 17 April.

Operations shifted to Greece. The Axis success in the Battle of the Metaxas Line allowed them to outflank the main Greek Army position and encircle the most effective Greek force. Richthofen&#x27;s units supported the attack against the Line, without much interference from Allied air forces. Just 99 RAF aircraft (74 bombers) and 150 Greek aircraft opposed Richthofen&#x27;s 500. By 15 April, the RAF had withdrawn. From this date, &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII″s&quot; main targets were Allied ships cramming the evacuation ports. Unlike the gross over claiming against British shipping in the English Channel in 1940, the claims of 280,000 tons of shipping (60 vessels) destroyed up until 30 April 1941 were approximately correct.

Allied forces withdrew down the east coast of Greece, where the Royal Navy and Greek Navy began evacuating them from ports around southern Greece, including the capital, Athens. Ju 87 units from Richthofen&#x27;s Corps inflicted high losses on shipping, eliminating the small Greek Navy and causing damage to British shipping. In two days, the Greek Naval base at Piraeus lost 23 vessels to &quot;Stuka&quot; attack. From 21 to 24 April 43 ships were sunk on the southern coast. Total Allied shipping losses amounted to 360,000 tons.

The end of the campaign on the mainland meant the sole remaining objective was the island of Crete, which lay off Greece&#x27;s southern coastline. During the Battle of Crete Richthofen&#x27;s Ju 87s also played a significant role. The operation came close to disaster on the first day. Most of the airborne forces that landed by glider or parachute lost most of their radios, which meant Richthofen had to rely on aerial reconnaissance aircraft. The German parachute troops were pinned down on the island, on the Cretan airfields they were supposed to capture. The level of effort Richthofen directed at relieving the pressure on them quite possibly saved the German units from destruction.

On 21–22 May 1941, the Germans attempted to send in reinforcements to Crete by sea, but lost 10 vessels to &quot;Force D&quot; under the command of Rear-Admiral Irvine Glennie. The force consisting of the cruisers , and forced the remaining German ships to retreat. The &quot;Stukas&quot; were called upon to deal with the British Naval threat. On 21 May, the destroyer was sunk, and the next day, the battleship was damaged and the cruiser was sunk with the loss of 45 officers and 648 ratings. The Ju 87s also crippled the cruiser that morning, while sinking the destroyer with a single hit. As the Battle of Crete drew to a close the Allies began yet another withdrawal. On 23 May the Royal Navy also lost the destroyers and sunk followed by on 26 May; &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Dido&quot; were also severely damaged. &quot;Orion&quot; had been evacuating 1,100 soldiers to North Africa and lost 260 of them killed and another 280 wounded during the attacks. Around eight British destroyers and four cruisers were sunk (not all by air attack), along with five destroyers of the Greek Navy.

===Eastern Front===
====Operation Barbarossa====

On 22 June 1941 the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Richthofen continued his command of &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; which contained JG 27, StG 2, StG 3, 10./LG 2, and II.(S)./LG 2. Added to this force was II./&quot;Jagdgeschwader 52&quot; (JG 52), I./&quot;Kampfgeschwader 2&quot; (KG 2), III./&quot;Kampfgeschwader 3&quot; (KG 3) and &quot;Zerstörergeschwader 26&quot; (ZG 26). Initially his force supported Army Group Centre, under the command of Kesselring&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte 2&quot;.

The &quot;Flivos&quot; that Richthofen had championed in 1939 became a uniform facility throughout the Luftwaffe. Each Panzer and Motorised division now had air liaison officers attached to them to allow for effective air support. The experiments in France and the low countries had paid off. By the summer of 1941, the Luftwaffe and its land-air liaison teams would dramatically reduce the number of friendly-fire incidents, as German assault aviation would have detailed knowledge of friendly and enemy dispositions. It would not be until the beginning of 1943 that the Western Allies began adopting the same methods. In the opening phase of Barbarossa, Richthofen&#x27;s units were able to perform well. The response time for air support usually did not exceed two hours.

In the opening rounds, Richthofen was involved in large pre-emptive strikes against the Red Air Force (&quot;Voyenno-vozdushnyye sily&quot;, or VVS) airfields. The Luftwaffe lost 78 aircraft on 22 June, but destroyed 1,489 aircraft on the ground, though further research indicates the number exceeded 2,000 destroyed. In July, waves of unescorted Soviet bombers tried in vain to halt the German advance, only to suffer extremely high losses. Within three days, the close support units of Kesselring&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2, including Richthofen&#x27;s Corps, were able to revert to close support and interdiction operations largely unhindered.

On 23 June, his Corps decimated the Soviet 6th Cavalry Corps (Western Front) when they attempted a counterattack near Grodno. Richthofen threw all available aircraft at the thrust and played a vital role in its defeat. The Soviet Corps suffered 50 per cent casualties, mostly from air attack. Richthofen&#x27;s Corps claimed 30 tanks, and 50 motor vehicles in 500 sorties. Army Group Centre continued to advance, reaching Vitebsk. &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; supported the army in the Battle of Smolensk only days later. In this phase he was also moved south, to support Panzer Group Guderian, which succeeded in supporting the capture of Orsha. The encirclement of Soviet forces at Smolensk was complete on 17 July 1941. Three weeks later, the last Soviet forces in the pocket were eliminated. &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII″s&quot; achievements were important in defeating Soviet counterattacks and attempted breakouts. Richthofen was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight&#x27;s Cross for an impressive performance. Results from the battles, and in particular the defeat of Soviet counterattacks by the Soviet 13th and 24th Armies, were impressive. Richthofen&#x27;s forces were credited with disrupting reinforcements and destroying 40 motor vehicles on 24 July alone.

However, logistically, the Germans were starting to suffer serious problems in supplying their frontline just four weeks into the campaign. Richthofen lamented, &quot;the Germans are good at fighting but weak at logistics&quot;. While German production could make up for losses at the front, it took time to get aircraft to the sector. The common operating strength by late summer was 50 to 60 percent, including &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot;. Between 19 July and 31 August, the Luftwaffe had lost 725 aircraft. Before the operations in the Soviet Union, scant attention had been made to logistical operations in the east, primarily because of German over-confidence.

The victories had been hard won, but growing Soviet resistance and increased counterattacks brought the Smolensk-Moscow front to a stalemate. Hitler wavered, and on 30 July ordered Army Group Centre to assume the strategic defensive. In Directive 34, he refocused the main effort of &quot;Barbarossa&quot; on Leningrad because of strong concentrations of enemy forces west of Moscow. To this end, Richthofen and his &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; were assigned to &quot;Luftflotte 1&quot; (Air Fleet 1). During July 1941, the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW, or German High Command) displayed a lack of coherent strategy. It shifted from pursuing one objective to the next. It first wanted to advance to Moscow, then Leningrad, before shifting operations further south.

====Leningrad====
Richthofen took almost all of his units to support Army Group North. In heavy combat, working with &quot;Fliegerkorps I&quot;, Richthofen&#x27;s fleet flew 1,126 sorties on 10 August, supporting the German army&#x27;s advance on Narva. They claimed 10 tanks, more than 200 motor vehicles, and 15 artillery batteries. Further support was rendered to the German Sixteenth Army at Novgorod near Lake Ilmen. Experienced crews from Richthofen&#x27;s Corps attacked railways near Leningrad to disrupt reinforcements. &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII″s&quot; airmen noted Soviet resistance was far harder in the Lake Ilmen area than they had previously experienced. On 15 August, a major effort destroyed the main Soviet supply bridge over the Volkhov River. The fortress of Novgorod was destroyed by Richthofen&#x27;s Ju 87s, and was abandoned. The city fell on 16 August. Just 24 hours later, a major Soviet counter offensive by the Soviet Northwestern Front attempted to recapture the city. Richthofen, in conjunction with &quot;Fliegerkorps I&quot;, almost completely destroyed the attackers near Staraya Russa.

The German Eighteenth Army and the Sixteenth Army overran the remaining parts of Estonia, seizing Chudovo, north of Novgorod, which severed one of the two main supply lines from Leningrad to Moscow. In support of these operations, Richthofen&#x27;s Corps dropped 3,351 tons of bombs in 5,042 attacks from 10 to 20 August 1941. Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, the commander-in-chief of Army Group North, was shocked by the ferocity of Richtofen&#x27;s bombing operations, describing him as &quot;merciless&quot;. On 20 August Richthofen moved strike and fighter aircraft to Spasskaya Polist, 40 km north-east of Novgorod, to support an attack that would encircle Leningrad and cut it off from Murmansk. German XXXXI Panzer Corps sealed in Soviet forces in the Lake Ilmen-Luga-Novgorod sector. The Leningrad Front attempted to relieve them, and Richthofen was ordered to blunt its attack. The Soviets were supported by strong air units, and large air battles broke out. The Germans succeeded in maintaining their lines, and could now turn to capturing Leningrad.

Before a main assault could be launched, Leningrad needed to be completely cut off from the Soviet hinterland which led to the Siege of Leningrad. This was achieved by &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot;, which supported the German Eighteenth Army in forcing the Soviet 54th Army from the shores of Lake Ladoga and Leningrad was isolated. Thereafter, &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; and &quot;Fliegerkorps I&quot; concentrated on 16 square kilometres of front over Leningrad, achieving numerical superiority. Richthofen&#x27;s bombers participated in great efforts to destroy Leningrad from the air, some crews flying two missions per night. On 8 September, 6,327 incendiaries alone were dropped, causing 183 fires. The German Army advanced into the breaches created by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. However, the Soviets stalled the German advance on 25 September by committing their last resources and reinforcing their 54th Army (later renamed the 48th Army). With the offensive stopped, Hitler returned Richthofen to &quot;Luftflotte 2&quot;. Operations had been expensive. In August &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; had lost 27 aircraft destroyed and 143 damaged.

====Moscow offensive====

Frustrated in the north, Hitler turned to Moscow. On 2 October 1941 he enacted Operation Typhoon, an offensive aimed at capturing Moscow via a pincer movement. It achieved early success in enveloping considerable Soviet forces at Vyazma and Bryansk by 10 October. However, the initial success gave way to a grinding battle of attrition. By 11 November the situation in the air was also changing from a position of initial parity. Kesselring&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2 and the headquarters of &quot;Fliegerkorps I&quot; were moved to the Mediterranean Theatre. This left Richthofen&#x27;s &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; in control of all Axis aviation supporting Army Group Centre against Moscow. The Soviet opposition was growing in number and quality. By 10 November, 1,138 aircraft (738 serviceable) including 658 fighters (497 serviceable) were defending Moscow. The weather slowed down operations until 15 November, when the mud and rain water froze and mobile operations became possible. Richthofen threw all available aircraft into the Battle for Moscow whenever conditions permitted. &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; flew 1,300 sorties from 15 to 24 November.

One last attempt to capture Moscow was made on 2 December, but lack of fuel and ammunition and increasingly stiff resistance prevented its success. By this time, the Soviet air forces had gained air superiority. By 5 December, when the counteroffensive drove Army Group Centre back, they could muster 1,376 aircraft against just 600 German. The Germans possessed just 487 fighters (200 serviceable) on the entire Eastern Front. There were 674 Soviet fighters (480 serviceable) on the Moscow front. When the Soviet offensive began it quickly gained ground. German morale sank and Army Group Centre, overstretched and exhausted, was threatened with collapse. Richthofen&#x27;s forces, despite enemy air superiority, did all they could to blunt the attack. The effectiveness and determination of German air units improved the morale of the army. Concentrating aviation against Soviet ground forces, the Luftwaffe delivered a series of attacks that took the wind out of the Soviet offensive within two weeks. Richthofen&#x27;s forces bore the main burden of the air defence against the Soviet attack, and had been reinforced with four &quot;Kampfgruppen&quot;. Hitler had forbidden a retreat, and Richthofen endorsed this view. His refusal to give ground and his tenacity saw him become one of Hitler&#x27;s favourites. Hitler gave him a further five transport groups to keep his Corps effective. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII would stay on the front until April 1942, fighting against a series of Soviet counter offensives.

====Move to the Crimea====

In the winter, 1941–1942, the stalemate on the north and central sectors was not mirrored in the south. Army Group South had overrun Ukraine, were outside Rostov, considered the gate to the Caucasus and its rich oil fields, and had occupied most of the Crimea. However, in December the Soviets made an amphibious landing at the Kerch Peninsula, on the extreme east coast of the Crimea. The landing threatened to cut off the German Eleventh Army commanded by Erich von Manstein, which were engaged in the siege of Sevastopol. On 31 March, Manstein laid down his plans and called his offensive Operation Trappenjagd (Bustard Hunt). On 17 April, he demanded massed close support aviation for his offensive. Manstein turned to Richthofen and &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot;, which had returned to the front after resting and refitting in Germany. The Crimean base allowed the Black Sea Fleet to continue operating against Axis shipping, and it would also provide air bases for the VVS to attack the Romanian oil fields. Hitler supported Manstein and called for the greatest possible concentration of air power to support the operation.

Richthofen had arrived in Luneberg on 12 April, ready for a four-week period of leave. On 18 April he received a call from the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Chief of the General Staff Hans Jeschonnek, who informed him he was to leave for Kerch immediately. He commented in his diary, &quot;By order of the Führer, I must immediately leave again, to work at Kerch. Get there quickly and get everything started! Formal orders still to come&quot;. After meeting Hitler he wrote, &quot;The Fuhrer insisted in a very respectful manner that I should take part at Kerch, because I&#x27;m the only person who can do the job.&quot; Hitler had a high opinion of Richthofen, and believed the Corps&#x27; record as a specialised close-support force was unparalleled and would guarantee success. Richthofen was arrogant, aggressive and harsh, but he was a driven, pro-active, successful and influential tactical air commander.

Richthofen&#x27;s Corps had been resting in Germany, rebuilding after the winter battles. This was still in progress when Richthofen landed at &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4&#x27;s headquarters at Nikolayev on 21 April. The discussion that Richthofen had with Löhr, the air fleet&#x27;s commander, was unique in Luftwaffe history. For the first time organisational custom, which was to place Corps level units under the command of an air fleet in whatever region the Corps was deployed, was abandoned. Richthofen was allowed to operate independently alongside &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4. &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; was under his command at all times and would provide the lion&#x27;s share of close support operations. All offensive air operations were Richthofen&#x27;s responsibility, and he was only answerable to Hermann Göring. This news was not received well by Löhr or his chief of staff at &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4, Günther Korten.

Richthofen met with Manstein on 28 April, and largely got on with Manstein. Despite being conceited personalities, they both genuinely respected each other. Though on one occasion Richthofen claimed in his diary to have taken great delight in beating Manstein in a debate over tactical differences. Manstein and Richthofen determined that the limited land forces available made cooperation between land and air forces critical. The main points of effort were discussed and each man&#x27;s staff was ordered to deal directly with each other to facilitate rapid cooperation.

====Kerch campaign====
Richthofen flew in his small &quot;Storch&quot; aircraft around the front, often coming under enemy fire and occasionally force-landing. He urged his Corps to speed up preparations and openly criticised his superiors, including Löhr of &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot;, over what he considered to be &quot;inferior&quot; preparations. The difficulty in getting units out of Germany quickly, where they were refitting, prompted Richthofen, in consultation with Jeschonnek and Manstein, to ask for a postponement of the offensive for two days until they could be brought in. His request was granted, and the offensive was moved to 7 May 1942. When the reinforcements arrived, he had 11 bomber, three dive-bomber and seven fighter &quot;Gruppen&quot; at his disposal.

Richthofen&#x27;s forces quickly established air superiority in the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, destroying 82 enemy fighters within the first day. Richthofen arrived at his command post as the bombs first fell. He was impressed with the 2,100 sorties flown on 7 May. Inter service communication was facilitated by &quot;Fliegerverbindungsoffizier&quot; (air liaison officers or &quot;Flivos&quot;), specially trained air force officers attached to ground units. They advised the air Corps on the situation and intentions of the ground forces and also advised the army of the best use of air power. This operational style was effective against fixed targets in slow-moving operations, but was more difficult in fast-moving operations such as &quot;Bustard Hunt&quot;. The advance meant Richthofen had to keep moving forward. He complained bitterly about the inability of his signals teams to set up new telephone and radio communications quickly enough.

Operations were successful. The Corps flew 1,700 missions on 9 May, destroying 42 enemy aircraft for two losses. On 10 and 11 May, bad weather prevented large-scale operations, but on 12 May they flew 1,500 sorties. On this day, the Soviet line in the Crimea collapsed. Enjoying air supremacy, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; made large gains. Near the Sea of Azov, Soviet infantry, massed and unprotected, suffered heavy losses to Richthofen&#x27;s units which were using cluster bombs. Richthofen was delighted at the &quot;wonderful scene&quot;, stating, &quot;we are inflicting the highest losses of blood and material&quot;. He described the destruction as &quot;terrible! Corpse-strewn fields from earlier attacks...I have seen nothing like it so far in this war&quot;. He was so shocked, he felt compelled to show the Luftwaffe&#x27;s signals officer, Wolfgang Martini, the carnage.

However, that same evening, Richhofen received bad news. He was ordered to send one fighter, one dive-bomber and two bomber &quot;Gruppen&quot; to help contain a Soviet breakthrough in the north, and the developing Second Battle of Kharkov. Richthofen complained in his diary, claiming success was now in question at Kerch. The statement was likely hyperbole. By this time the Soviets had collapsed in the Crimea, and were streaming back to the port of Kerch. Kerch fell on 15 May. Richthofen then complained he did not have the adequate forces to stop the Soviets evacuating by sea, but Axis aviation did inflict considerable attrition on Soviet units on the beaches and sank a number of vessels. German artillery and air attack brought the Dunkirk-style evacuation to an end on 17 May. Manstein praised Richthofen&#x27;s support, describing his air operations as decisive in the Kerch victory. The Corps had flown between 1,000 and 2,000 missions per day before the Kharkov withdrawal, and 300 to 800 afterwards. It reduced Soviet air power in the region from 300 aircraft to 60 in 10 days. Other sources give a total of 3,800 sorties flown in support of &quot;Trappenjagd&quot;.

====Crimea and Sevastopol====
On 20 May, Richthofen met Manstein again to discuss preparations for overcoming the fortress port of Sevastopol. It was emphasised that the same level of air support offered at Kerch was needed. On 22 May, Richthofen had the chance to meet with Hitler, who once again flattered the Luftwaffe commander and his abilities, referring to him as &quot;his specialist&quot;. The aim of the discussion as far as Richthofen was concerned, was to impress upon Hitler the importance of not diverting forces away from the front as had been done at Kerch. Hitler listened closely and agreed. Hitler and the Chief of the General Staff Hans Jeschonnek intended to promote Richthofen to command &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 4, while sending Alexander Löhr to the Balkans. Göring wanted Bruno Loerzer, his friend and commander of &quot;Fliegerkorps II&quot; to take the job, but Hitler wanted a hands-on commander. Jeschonnek agreed that the higher command of the air force was lousy, and needed a competent combat leader. On 25 May, Richthofen flew the six-hour flight back to Simferopol.

During the planning phase he ordered anti-shipping operations to cease in the region. Richthofen feared that the coming operations would mean friendly fire incidents against Axis shipping near Sevastopol. Admiral Götting and &quot;Fliegerführer Süd&quot; (Flying Leader South) Wolfgang von Wild, responsible for all naval aviation in the region, ignored the request; it was only necessary to abandon operations in the Crimean shipping lanes, not the whole expanse of the Black Sea.

Richthofen pooled his resources with Wild and Kurt Pflugbeil&#x27;s &quot;Fliegerkorps IV&quot;. This gave the Luftwaffe some 600 aircraft to support Manstein. Richthofen scraped up all the forces he could for the assault, getting three dive-bomber, six medium bomber and three fighter Gruppen for the operation. He was not overly concerned with his fighter strength, as his fighters outnumbered the 60-odd aircraft of the Soviet air defence. He could begin close support operations immediately and did not have to wait to conduct time-wasting battles for air superiority. So confident was Richthofen that the VVS posed no threat, he lent his Flak forces to the army, though he retained operational control.

The stages of the air campaign were managed into three; attacking Soviet reserves beyond German artillery; raids against harbour facilities, airfields, fortresses and shipping; cooperating with German artillery to cancel out Soviet mortar and gun batteries. Richthofen acknowledged that not all of these components could be conducted simultaneously. He chose shattering the fortifications through relentless air bombardment as most important. To do this, Richthofen garnered most of the air units into supporting the land operations. His view of anti-shipping operations, and Wolfgang von Wild&#x27;s conduct of them, was scathing. However, he did not take into account the systemic technical problems with German U-boat and aerial torpedoes which were unreliable, and blamed Wild and the air units instead for failing to achieve much success.

When the operation, &quot;Sturgeon Catch&quot;, began on 2 June 1942, Richthofen watched it all unfold. He watched the first waves of bombers hit Sevastopol from his own Storch, in company with his chief of staff. The air units of &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII were positioned close to the front. Richthofen&#x27;s forces flew 723 sorties and dropped 525 tons of bombs. The bombs included the fortress busting 1,400, 1,700 and 1,800 kg bombs. Between 3 and 6 June, 2,355 missions showered 1,800 tons of bombs and 23,000 incendiaries. On 7 June 1,300 tons of bombs were dropped in 1,368 air attacks, and these were followed on 8 June by another 1,200 sorties. The mechanics were working around the clock in sweltering heat (up to 40C) to keep the aircraft operational. On 9 June 1,044 sorties and 954 tons of bombs were dropped, followed by 688 sorties and 634 tons the next day. Richthofen&#x27;s logistics were stretched after a week of action. On 11 June another effort dropped 1,000 tons of bombs in 1,070 sorties. Richthofen noted that he now had only enough supplies for 36 hours of operations. He ordered only important and fewer targets attacked, ordering aircraft to attack in columns to reduce the wastage of bombs and keep the pressure up on the fortifications. It failed to solve the &quot;bomb calamity&quot;, Richthofen noted on 14 June, and three days later he could only drop 800 of the planned 1,000 tons.

Richthofen&#x27;s participation in the operation came to an abrupt end on 23 June 1942. Having been informed by Jeschonnek and Hitler that he was to assume command of &quot;Luftlfotte 4&quot; after the fall of Sevastopol earlier, they decided not to wait. They ordered him to Kursk in order to take up his command, leaving his Corps behind, and Sevastopol air operations under the command of Wild. Richthofen was disgusted. He felt it was ridiculous to move him mid-operation, and he had wanted to be there when the fortress fell. He wrote, &quot;It is a pity that one can never finish what one starts in the east. After a while, it takes away all the pleasure.&quot;

Without Richthofen, &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot; continued to contribute to the successful but costly operation. The Corps flew 23,751 sorties and dropped 20,000 tons of bombs, losing just 31 aircraft. The Axis finally achieved victory on 4 July 1942, when the last defenders were routed. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s close support arm reached a peak over Sevastopol. From then on, it would be dispersed over the Eastern Front.

====Case Blue====
On 28 June 1942 the Axis began their major summer offensive, Case Blue. Army Group South&#x27;s objective was to advance towards the Stalingrad and Caucasus regions. Now commanding &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot;, Generaloberst Richthofen had one of the largest commands supporting the effort. The Luftwaffe concentrated its largest single force since &quot;Barbarossa&quot;. Of the 2,690 aircraft supporting Case Blue, 52 per cent (1,400) were under the command of Richthofen. A further 265 Romanian, Hungarian, Italian and Slovak aircraft were also present. Opposing them were 2,800 aircraft (900 in reserve) including 1,200 fighters of the southern VVS front. To the north, the Soviets had been convinced the main attack was to come against Moscow owing to the German deception plan Operation Kremlin.

The offensive opened on 28 June, and the Red Army put the German forces on the boundary of Army Groups Centre and South under severe pressure in the belief the main thrust to Moscow would emanate from that region. The battles of Voronezh cost the Soviets 783 aircraft by 24 July, but it meant Richthofen had to divert &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot;, now under the command of Martin Fiebig, north to deal with the threats while Pflugbeil&#x27;s &quot;Fliegerkorps IV&quot; covered the advance into the Caucasus. On 18 July Richthofen moved &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; and its headquarters to Mariupol on the Sea of Azov. On 2 August Richthofen created the &quot;Gefechtsverband Nord&quot; under the command of Alfred Bulowius. Within six weeks, Richthofen had lost 350 aircraft and objected to Hitler&#x27;s directive splitting the two armies (Army Group A and B) to pursue the capture of Stalingrad and the Baku oilfields at the same time, as he now had to support two lines of logistics which he could ill-afford. Nevertheless, he committed himself to his task, and ordered Fiebig to destroy rail links around Stalingrad, where the German Sixth Army, despite having 1,000 aircraft supporting its drive to the city, were struggling to make rapid headway.

On 3 September, the Luftwaffe began its major effort against the city by beginning several destructive raids. The Battle of Stalingrad initiated a regression in air tactics back to the First World War, where a few flights of aircraft made pin-point attacks against enemy infantry and acted as an extension of the infantry. In October, the Romanian Air Corps (consisting of 180 aircraft) arrived and began attacking rail targets north east of Stalingrad, easing the air situation. Logistics were stretched and the front in Stalingrad formed into a stalemate, with the Germans having taken central and southern Stalingrad. With no reinforcements, and having lost 14 percent of his strength, Richthofen turned to support the German Army in the Caucasus. Göring ordered him to concentrate on Stalingrad, but Richthofen refused to return. This prompted a meeting between Hitler, Jeschnonnek and Göring on 15 October. Hitler was in a good mood, and he had taken personal command of Army Group A operations in the Caucasus on 9 September. He supported Richthofen and gave him the authority to continue, partly in the belief that the battle in Stalingrad was nearly over. Richthofen accused the army of &quot;constipation&quot; in Stalingrad on 22 September and was critical of its vacillation a month earlier.

This had not always been the case. Most of German aviation had been concentrated on the Stalingrad Front in August, on Hitler&#x27;s orders. Pflugbeil&#x27;s &quot;Fliegerkorps IV&quot; was over-stretched for over a month from 28 July. Richthofen had wanted to support Army Group A in the south, but despite the Caucasus oilfields being the primary target for German strategy, the Army Group received poor air support. Richthofen&#x27;s arm-chair general tactics were important in deciding where air power was to be used, and would be done so only if he rated the army&#x27;s chances of success. He allowed some raids against Grozny&#x27;s oilfields and close support operations, but the mountain terrain in the region made it difficult for the Panzer Divisions to exploit the actions of his air units. In a fit of pique at the army&#x27;s failures, Richthofen refused to provide support for the Caucasus front. This remained the situation until mid-October. For a few days, a concentrated effort was made in the Caucasus. Hitler&#x27;s realisation that the oilfields at Baku could not be captured meant that he was forced to order the Luftwaffe to eliminate them. The operations had limited success.

In the winter, Richthofen was forced to reshuffle his units around to meet threats and offer support. By 7 November, he had helped the German Sixth Army eliminate nearly all of the Soviet forces in Stalingrad. But the effort created a supply crisis. The Luftwaffe″s railheads were 100 kilometres west of Stalingrad, and regardless of the army&#x27;s difficulties, his units got logistical priority. Richthofen recommended this be amended. The battle in Stalingrad had meant, in Richthofen&#x27;s view, that air units could not be effective in close-quarter combat. Until this point, Richthofen had received 42,630 tons of supplies and 20,713 tons of fuel while the army received 9,492 tons of fuel. He rationed his own fuel stocks which allowed him to create a reserve but also increased, by air lift, the tonnage from 2,000 to 5,000 tons.

====Defeat at Stalingrad====

On 19 November the Red Army began a counter offensive, named Operation Uranus. Within days, the Soviets had encircled some 300,000 German, Italian, Romanian and Hungarian soldiers in the city of Stalingrad. It was decided by Hitler and the OKL to supply the Axis forces by air. Richthofen was horrified. He telephoned Berchtesgaden and tried to get through to Hitler, but none of his aides would put him through. He tried to convince Göring that his air fleet did not have the resources to sustain an air lift, and that the best option would be to attempt a breakout before the Soviet forces entrenched. He flew to Manstein&#x27;s headquarters, and the Field Marshal agreed a breakout must take place. With the Sixth Army preserved, the initiative could be regained later. He made this request to Hitler. The Soviet divisions were smaller than their German counterparts: but they had 97. Holding Stalingrad was now impossible.

In the event, Hitler chose to continue with the airlift, perhaps influenced by the Luftwaffe″s success in the Demyansk Pocket. &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; failed to alter the situation. The best air lift operation took place on 7 December 1942, when 363.6 tons were flown in. However, the concentration of Soviet aviation disrupted the intended supply operations and German transport losses were heavy. Some 266 Junkers Ju 52s were destroyed, three-quarters of the fleet&#x27;s strength on the Eastern Front. The He 111 &quot;gruppen&quot; lost 165 aircraft in transport operations. Other losses included 42 Junkers Ju 86s, nine Fw 200 Condors, five Heinkel He 177 bombers and a Junkers Ju 290. The Luftwaffe also lost close to 1,000 highly experienced bomber crew personnel. So heavy were the Luftwaffe″s losses that four of Luftflotte 4&#x27;s transport units (KGrzbV 700, KGrzbV 900, I./KGrzbV 1 and II./KGzbV 1) were &quot;formally dissolved&quot;. In the air, the Luftwaffe had sustained its heaviest defeat since the Battle of Britain. The remnants of the German Sixth Army surrendered on 2 February 1943.

A complete disaster was averted by Army Group South, largely thanks to Richthofen&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; and his former &quot;Fliegerkorps VIII&quot;, under his overall command. The loss of Stalingrad left Rostov-on-Don the only bottleneck supplying Army Group A in the Caucasus. In December 1942, &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; was still one of the most powerful single air commands in the world. On 15 January 1943, 1,140 of the 1,715 aircraft on the Eastern Front were under Richthofen&#x27;s command. Its attacks on the Soviet Southwestern Front prevented the Soviets from achieving the goal of isolating the Army Group in the Caucasus. Its air operations proved decisive in this regard.

Although defeated, &quot;Luftflotte 4&quot; had flown 24,760 wounded and 5,150 technical personnel out of Stalingrad, which was 11 per cent of the total German manpower. It delivered only 19 per cent of the required supplies. It had four fewer transport groups than at Demyansk, so failed in its overall task despite Fiebig ordering his bombers onto transport operations. They managed an average of 68 sorties per day, delivering 111 tons of supplies against the requirement of 300 tons for the Sixth Army.

After the defeat, Richthofen travelled to see Hitler on 11 February. He first met with Göring and allayed Göring&#x27;s fears that Richthofen would use the opportunity to criticise Göring&#x27;s leadership in front of Hitler. Richthofen later did criticise Göring&#x27;s reluctance to disagree with Hitler, and attacked his willingness to allow Hitler to receive what Richthofen considered to be faulty advice. When Richthofen did meet Hitler he was critical of him for micromanagement, though he soothed Hitler&#x27;s ego by insisting he had been let down by advisors. Hitler apparently took all of this calmly, and admitted that he bore the ultimate responsibility for the air lift fiasco. Richthofen argued that commanders needed more tactical and operational freedom, and won Hitler&#x27;s agreement – though subsequent operations showed Hitler&#x27;s remarks were insincere. Richthofen avoided a confrontation because Hitler liked him and believed him to be loyal. Four days later Richthofen was promoted to the rank of field marshal, being the youngest officer besides Göring to reach this rank in the Wehrmacht.

===Later command===
The frontline threatened to collapse altogether in the east, but the Red Army had not yet learned the full lessons of manoeuvre warfare. At Stalin&#x27;s behest, it attempted to cut off the Axis forces in the Caucasus by advancing to Rostov, using Kharkov and Belgorod as a springboard. This strained the logistics of Soviet forces, and presented an ideal chance for Manstein to counterattack. Radio intercepts suggested that the Soviets were low on fuel, both for their ground forces and the VVS, giving more urgency for a counter strike. It would lead to the Third Battle of Kharkov, where Manstein would win a major victory.

To support his attack Richthofen sent eight of his weakest &quot;Gruppen&quot; home to rest and refit, which allowed the machines left to be redistributed among stronger units. With congestion eased the infrastructure could cope with serviceability, which improved dramatically. The Luftwaffe was also now back near to pre-prepared air bases, near logistical railheads at Mykolaiv and Poltava, which enabled accelerated rates of re-equipment. After allowing his forces to re-equip near Rostov, he moved his units on 18 February. Richthofen moved his forces closer to the front. &quot;Fliegerkorps I&quot;, now under Günther Korten, was moved from Boryspil, near Kiev, to Poltava. &quot;Fliegerkorps IV&quot; under Fiebig was moved to the Kuban, and &quot;Fliegerkorps V&quot; under Pflugbeil was moved to Dnepropetrovsk in the centre of the German offensive thrust. These forces were to support the First Panzer Army and the Fourth Panzer Army. Korten began his support for the Fourth Panzer Army on 19 February 1943. By 21 February 1,145 sorties had been flown, and another 1,486 were flown the following day. The Luftwaffe flew a daily average of 1,000 sorties with total air superiority, owing to the absence of the VVS. Manstein encircled and destroyed a large number of enemy forces, stabilising the front, but leaving a bulge in the east, around the city of Kursk.

Throughout the spring and early summer of 1943, Richthofen began preparing his air fleet for Operation Citadel and the Battle of Kursk, the major summer campaign which was supposed to repeat the Kharkov victory on a larger scale and turn the tide in the east back in the Axis&#x27; favour. Richthofen did not take part. 

The Third Battle of Kharkov proved to be his last battle on the Eastern Front, and he was transferred to the Mediterranean, where he would command Luftwaffe forces in the Italian Campaign. One of Richthofen’s major problems in Italy had been the weakness of the Italian air force. Although he had little faith in Italian fascist command, he recognized Italy&#x27;s great industrial potential to produce high-quality aircraft. Richthofen would recommended that the Luftwaffe adopt Italian-designed and produced aircraft, in particular the Fiat G 55 fighter which had great performance. His recommendations were mostly ignored by Luftwaffe high command. After the situation at Salerno stabilised, he put forward an ambitious set of plans to quickly build up a large air force for Mussolini&#x27;s new Italian Social Republic. He asked for personnel and aircraft from the Reichs Air Ministry to set up a pilot schools for Italian recruits, which would consist of many trained personnel of the old regime. He further proposed that the Germans treat the Italians as partners rather than subordinates. These plans gained Göring&#x27;s approval, but Hitler summarily turned them down with the comment that he did not want to hear about rearming the Italians.

By early 1944, with few aircraft at his disposal, the Luftwaffe in Italy became primarily a flak organization. The aviation force that Richthofen commanded in Italy as a field marshal was smaller than the air forces he commanded as a major general in Poland. In January 1944 the Allied landings at Anzio caught Richthofen by surprise. The Allied invasion forces had formulated an effective strategy on how to deal with the threat of the Luftwaffe in Italy. With the help of &quot;Ultra&quot; intelligence, German airfields were attacked so frequently and effectively that Luftwaffe units never recovered from their losses. Attrition was constant and far worse than on the eastern front. The failure of the German ground and air offensive against Anzio in April 1944, meant that the Allies would establish a firm beachhead, and there was no opportunity for Richthofen to launch any major counteroffensives in Italy.

===Death===

Throughout 1944 Richthofen suffered from headaches and exhaustion. In October it was discovered he was suffering from a brain tumour. He was sent on medical leave to the Luftwaffe hospital for neurological injuries at Bad Ischl in Austria. On 27 October 1944, he was operated on by a leading brain surgeon, Wilhelm Tönnis. Formerly a professor at the University of Würzburg, Tönnis was one of the most notable German specialists. Initially it was thought that the operation had been successful, but the progression of the tumour had only been slowed. In November 1944 Richthofen was officially relieved of his command in Italy and transferred to the Führerreserve. His condition declined steadily in early 1945. It is thought likely that Tönnis attempted a second operation, but that the tumour had progressed beyond hope of recovery. Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945. The hospital was taken over by the American Third Army, and Richthofen became a prisoner of war. 

He died on 12 July 1945 as an American prisoner of war in the air force hospital in Bad Ischl. His gravesite in the Bad Ischl cemetery has not been preserved, but his name is engraved on the cemetery cross next to the names of the people buried in war graves at the time.

==Reputation==
===Nazism===

The German Officer Corps was generally supportive of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. They supported German re-armament, Hitler&#x27;s disarming of the Sturmabteilung, and lauded the Nazi leader&#x27;s promises to establish the Reichswehr as the sole military organisation in the Third Reich. The appointment of Werner von Blomberg further bolstered support for Hitler among the remaining aristocratic army officers. Richthofen was an open admirer of Hitler, and by extension of the Nazi cause. In 1938, Richthofen crossed the boundaries keeping politics and military officers separate, when he gave a speech at a Nazi-sponsored &quot;Party Day&quot; rally in Lüneburg. From the lectern, he extolled the virtues of Hitler&#x27;s wisdom and leadership. Richthofen stated that the Nazi Party provided a strong sense of national unity and expressed the view that Germany would once again become a great power. Richthofen&#x27;s sincerity cannot be doubted, for he was not compelled to make public speeches and did not need to play political games to safeguard or advance his career.

Richthofen&#x27;s view of Nazi ideology was not straightforward. Richthofen was &quot;remarkably uninterested in politics or political ideology&quot;. His politics consisted of simple nationalism and belief in the leader, ideas common to his class. Though an admirer of Hitler, he was uninterested in the politics of the party, believing it lacked any coherent ideology beyond following the leadership of Adolf Hitler. Nevertheless, Richthofen never wavered in his admiration for Hitler and sincerely believed that Germany&#x27;s military decline, and the disastrous military decisions, were the fault of the General Staff advising Hitler. Richthofen subscribed to the Hitler myth—that the Nazi leader was a genius, who would revitalise Germany. Richthofen&#x27;s diary—which survived the war—has many examples of conversations with fellow officers in which he expresses his confidence in Hitler. After one briefing, in the summer of 1943, Richthofen praised Hitler&#x27;s &quot;brilliant grasp&quot; of military strategy, and blamed the &quot;idiotic&quot; Alfred Jodl and Wilhelm Keitel for the failures of the Wehrmacht. Richthofen&#x27;s biographer observed that he did not appear to question why a genius surrounded himself with incompetents and &quot;yes men&quot;.

Richthofen and Hitler maintained their harmonious relationship largely because they never worked closely together. Hitler, a soldier in the First World War, appreciated front-line fighting men and the perspective they brought back from the battlefield. Richthofen saw himself in this light, as a clear-thinking commander who had experienced the reality of the front. Because they met only occasionally, Richthofen maintained his idealised perception of Hitler.

Throughout German history, and in other militaries, leaders rewarded high-ranking military commanders for their service. These awards went from medals, to titles, to the appropriation of estates. Hitler practised the same policy, although his methods were fundamentally corrupt. When Richthofen was promoted to field marshal in 1943, he became a benefactor of financial payments that were not part of the state&#x27;s expenses and were transferred secretly. Richthofen was on &quot;List C&quot;, which earned him 4,000 Reichsmarks monthly; this was a standard monthly sum for the rank. This was an annual salary for the average German worker, and the manner of transfer allowed Richthofen to avoid income tax, thus committing fraud. Hitler used the system to keep his generals loyal to the war&#x27;s end, and Richthofen accepted the payments.

===War crimes analysis===

Richthofen is often regarded as a war criminal in the &quot;popular German press&quot;, because of the aerial bombings of Guernica in 1937 and Warsaw in 1939. In Corum&#x27;s view, this perception is based on the mythology surrounding German aerial doctrine of the time, which asserted without evidence that the Luftwaffe had a policy of &quot;terror bombing&quot; for which killing civilians and terrorising civil populations into submission was the primary aim. The sensationalism of press coverage since the bombings and &quot;grossly inflated casualty figures&quot; have not helped Richthofen&#x27;s image. Corum asserts Guernica was never intended as a model for aerial terror attacks.

Warsaw, however, appeared to have all the hallmarks of a &quot;terror attack&quot;: the use of high explosives and incendiary bombs (632 tons) destroyed a portion of the city and killed an estimated 6,000 civilians or non-combatants. The casualty figures have been exaggerated in contemporary and post-war accounts. Corum argues that the bombing was a &quot;cruel act of war&quot;, but international law, as it was then commonly understood, allowed for the bombardment of a defended city, and at that time Warsaw had approximately 150,000 Polish soldiers defending its districts. Corum argued it was in the German interest to secure victory through aerial bombing and avoid potentially costly urban warfare. The Luftwaffe had limited ability to carry out &quot;massive&quot; strategic bombing operations, even if terror bombing had formed part of German doctrine. Corum also exculpates Richthofen for involvement in the attack on Belgrade in April 1941 (Operation Retribution). Richthofen was active against Greek Army positions in northern Greece at the time; Corum rejects the conclusions of some historians who associate Richthofen with the death of 17,000 civilians—which Corum also argues is inflated.

Corum concludes Richthofen was not a &quot;master of terror bombing&quot; and never made it his &quot;prime operational method. When he bombed towns and cities he did it for justifiable tactical and operational reasons. His manner was ruthless and he never expressed any moral qualms about his actions, nor did he show any sympathy for the people he bombed.&quot; This was a ruthless trait Richthofen shared with Allied air commanders, who did not agonise over the destruction of towns and cities if it offered a military advantage. The 1907 Hague Convention included little on aerial warfare. Articles 23, 25 and 27 forbade attacks on undefended cities, civilians or specific monuments. The convention&#x27;s vagueness offered large and obvious loopholes for air power practitioners.

Richtofen was morally guilty of war crimes. His personal responsibility, as a high-ranking commander in the Luftwaffe, was in his willingness to support Hitler&#x27;s grand program of conquest. During the war, the Wehrmacht systematically violated the rules of war and norms of civilisation. On 6 June 1941 the High Command issued the Commissar Order, which was sent throughout the chain of command of both the army and air force. The nature of the war on the Eastern Front—which differed enormously from its prosecution in Western Europe—can have left no doubt in the minds of senior Wehrmacht commanders that Germany was operating outside the rules of international law.

The German army was mainly responsible for the German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war. Corum argues that the Luftwaffe cannot escape culpability for the part it played in the deaths of 1.6 to 3.3 million prisoners. In his opinion, the Luftwaffe soldiers, ground forces and personnel exhibited the same callous disregard for prisoners. Corum writes that according to &quot;one account&quot;, Richthofen&#x27;s air corps moved into an airfield so rapidly that Soviet ground crews were found working in the facility. The unknown number were locked in a hangar, while the Luftwaffe waited for them to be taken off the airfield. They were denied food or water for several days. When Richthofen was told, he &quot;heartily approved.&quot; Slave labour was also used to build airfields in Eastern Europe, and there is no evidence that workers were treated any better by the Luftwaffe than by the German army. Few questions were raised by senior Luftwaffe officers about Nazi policy, and there were even fewer objections.

===Military legacy===
Richthofen is credited with contributions to the development of modern air-ground joint operations which encompassed the tactical and operational level. In 1942 his relationship with Erich von Manstein was a partnership of &quot;two great operational minds.&quot; While Richthofen may have had a &quot;superb&quot; military mind, it was oriented toward the practical and technical. He had little interest in literature, culture or ideas.

Richthofen was one of the few air commanders who pioneered practical solutions to the cooperation of ground and air forces, rather than developing theory. The successes of the German military in 1939 and 1940 placed them three years ahead of the Allied powers. No senior commander in the Luftwaffe put as much effort into developing close air support tactics from 1936 to 1942, or achieved comparable success. Of particular note was his secondment of airmen to the army with specialised vehicles that allowed the army and air force to direct air strikes from the frontlines. Not all of his methods were revolutionary. Age-old principles, such as employing forces &quot;en masse&quot; at the decisive points (focus of effort), were standard military practice stretching back centuries.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Richthofen&#x27;s biographer argues that he can be seen as one of &quot;air power&#x27;s visionaries&quot; for his understanding of how the development of the aeroplane and air power could change the battlefield, and for how he worked to make it a reality. Richthofen was also supportive of rocketry and jet propulsion while working at the Technical Research Office, at a time when leaders of the other major powers settled for larger piston-engine aircraft. During his time at the technical office, it was Richthofen who issued the contracts that led to the development of the V-1, the first practical cruise missile, and the V-2, the first long-range ballistic missile. These orders allowed for the development of German jet engines.

<text>The Governor Edmund G. Brown California Aqueduct is a system of canals, tunnels, and pipelines that conveys water collected from the Sierra Nevada and valleys of Northern and Central California to Southern California. Named after California Governor Edmund Gerald &quot;Pat&quot; Brown Sr., the over aqueduct is the principal feature of the California State Water Project.

The aqueduct begins at the Clifton Court Forebay at the southwestern corner of the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. The aqueduct then heads south, eventually splitting into three branches: the Coastal Branch, ending at Lake Cachuma in Santa Barbara County; the West Branch, conveying water to Castaic Lake in Los Angeles County; and the East Branch, connecting Silverwood Lake in San Bernardino County.

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) operates and maintains the California Aqueduct, including one pumped-storage hydroelectric plant, Gianelli Power Plant. Gianelli is located at the base of San Luis Dam, which forms San Luis Reservoir, the largest offstream reservoir in the United States.

The Castaic Power Plant, while similar and which is owned and operated by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, is located on the northern end of Castaic Lake, while Castaic Dam is located at the southern end.

Land subsidence has occurred along the aqueduct and has had a steady increase since its relatively stable state post construction of the aqueduct.
==The aqueduct system==

The aqueduct serves 35 million people and 5.7 million acres of farmland, and begins at the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta at the Banks Pumping Plant, which pumps from the Clifton Court Forebay. Water is pumped by the Banks Pumping Plant to the Bethany Reservoir. The reservoir serves as a forebay for the South Bay Aqueduct via the South Bay Pumping Plant. From the Bethany Reservoir, the aqueduct flows by gravity approximately to the O&#x27;Neill Forebay at the San Luis Reservoir. From the O&#x27;Neill Forebay, it flows approximately to the Dos Amigos Pumping Plant. After Dos Amigos, the aqueduct flows about to where the Coastal Branch splits from the &quot;main line&quot;. The split is approximately south-southeast of Kettleman City. After the coastal branch, the line continues by gravity another to the Buena Vista Pumping Plant. From the Buena Vista, it flows approximately to the Teerink Pumping Plant. After Teerink it flows about to the Chrisman Pumping Plant. Chrisman is the last pumping plant before Edmonston Pumping Plant, which is from Chrisman. South of the plant the west branch splits off in a southwesterly direction to serve the Los Angeles Basin. At Edmonston Pumping Plant it is pumped over the Tehachapi Mountains.

Water flows through the aqueduct in a series of abrupt rises and gradual falls. The water flows down a long segment, built at a slight grade, and arrives at a pumping station powered by Path 66 or Path 15. The pumping station raises the water, where it again gradually flows downhill to the next station. However, where there are substantial drops, the water&#x27;s potential energy is recaptured by hydroelectric plants. The initial pumping station fed by the Sacramento River Delta raises the water , while a series of pumps culminating at the Edmonston Pumping Plant raises the water over the Tehachapi Mountains.

A typical section has a concrete-lined channel at the base and an average water depth of about . The widest section of the aqueduct is and the deepest is . Channel capacity is and the largest pumping plant capacity at Dos Amigos is .

A 2021 study published in &quot;Nature Sustainability&quot; estimated that the installation of solar panels over the canal could potentially reduce annual water evaporation by of canal. While electricity generated by the solar panels could be used by the aqueduct&#x27;s pumping systems, the study also considered the possibility of supplying power to irrigation systems in the Central Valley to reduce reliance on diesel-powered irrigation pumps. Similar canal-spanning solar installations have been demonstrated in India, including a steel truss design in Gujarat and a suspension cable design in Punjab.

==Branches==
From its beginning until its first branch, the aqueduct passes through parts of Contra Costa, Alameda, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, Fresno, and Kings counties. The aqueduct then divides into three branches: the Coastal Branch in the Central Valley, and the East and West Branches after passing over the Tehachapi Mountains.
===Coastal Branch===
The Coastal Branch splits from the main line south-southeast of Kettleman City transiting Kings County, Kern County, San Luis Obispo County, and Santa Barbara County to deliver water to the coastal cities of San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, and Santa Barbara. The Coastal Branch is and has five pump stations. Phase I, an above-ground aqueduct totaling from where it branches from the California Aqueduct, was completed in 1968. With construction beginning in 1994, Phase II consists of of a diameter buried pipeline extending from the Devils Den Pump Plant, and terminates at Tank 5 on Vandenberg Space Force Base in Santa Barbara County. The Central Coast Water Authority (CCWA) extension, completed in 1997, is a (30–39 in) (76–99 cm) diameter pipeline that travels from Vandenberg through Vandenberg Village, Lompoc, Buellton, and Solvang where it terminates at Lake Cachuma in Los Padres National Forest.

Coastal Branch facilities include:
* Las Perillas Pumping Plant
* Badger Hill Pumping Plant
* Devil&#x27;s Den Pumping Plant
* Bluestone Pumping Plant
* Polonio Pass Pumping Plant
* Polonio Pass Water Treatment Plant
* Cuesta Tunnel
* Santa Ynez Pumping Facility

===East Branch===

The aqueduct splits off into the East Branch and West Branch in extreme southern Kern County, north of the Los Angeles County line. The East Branch supplies Lake Palmdale and terminates at Lake Perris, in the area of the San Gorgonio Pass. It passes through parts of Kern, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside counties.

East Branch facilities include:
* Tehachapi East Afterbay
* Alamo Power Plant
* Pearblossom Pumping Plant
* Mojave Siphon
* Mojave Siphon Power Plant
* Cedar Springs Dam
* Silverwood Lake
* San Bernardino Intake Structure
* San Bernardino Tunnel
* Devil Canyon Power Plant
* Devil Canyon Afterbay 1 and Afterbay 2
* Greenspot Pump Station (Backup)
* Citrus Reservoir
* Citrus Pump Station
* Crafton Hills Reservoir
* Crafton Hills Pump Station
* Cherry Valley Pump Station
* Perris Lake and Dam

===West Branch===
The West Branch continues to head towards its terminus at Pyramid Lake and Castaic Lake in the Angeles National Forest to supply the western Los Angeles basin. It passes through parts of Kern and Los Angeles counties.

West Branch facilities include
* Oso Pumping Plant
* Peace Valley Pipeline
* Warne Powerplant
* Angeles Tunnel
* Castaic Power Plant

===Bikeway===
When it was open, the California Aqueduct Bikeway was the longest of the paved paths in the Los Angeles area, at long from Quail Lake near Gorman in the Sierra Pelona Mountains through the desert to Silverwood Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains. This path was closed in 1988 due to bicyclist safety and liability issues. It is expected to remain closed indefinitely due to the continued liability issues and an increased focus on security, especially after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

==Hydrography==
Two major river systems drain and define the two parts of the Central Valley. Their impact on the California Aqueduct is both direct and indirect. The Sacramento River, along with its tributaries the Feather River and American River, flows southwards through the Sacramento Valley for about . In the San Joaquin Valley, the San Joaquin River flows roughly northwest for , picking up tributaries such as the Merced River, Tuolumne River, Stanislaus River and Mokelumne River.

In the south part of the San Joaquin Valley, the alluvial fan of the Kings River and another one from Coast Ranges streams have created a divide and resultantly the currently dry Tulare basin of the Central Valley, into which flow four major Sierra Nevada rivers, the Kings, Kaweah, Tule and Kern. This basin, usually endorheic, formerly filled during heavy snowmelt and spilled out into the San Joaquin River. Called Tulare Lake, it is usually dry nowadays because the rivers feeding it have been diverted for agricultural purposes.

The rivers of the Central Valley converge in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a complex network of marshy channels, distributaries and sloughs that wind around islands mainly used for agriculture. Here the freshwater of the rivers merges with tidewater, and eventually reach the Pacific Ocean after passing through Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, upper San Francisco Bay and finally the Golden Gate. Many of the islands now lie below sea level because of intensive agriculture, and have a high risk of flooding, which would cause salt water to rush back into the delta, especially when there is too little fresh water flowing in from the Valley.

The Sacramento River carries far more water than the San Joaquin, with an estimated of virgin annual runoff, as compared to the San Joaquin&#x27;s approximately . Intensive agricultural and municipal water consumption has reduced the present rate of outflow to about for the Sacramento and for the San Joaquin; however, these figures still vary widely from year to year. Over 25 million people, living both in the valley and in other regions of the state, rely on the water carried by these rivers.

== Land subsidence ==

=== Background ===
Land subsidence is when the land gradually or suddenly sinks or settles due to movement or removal of natural materials such as water, minerals, oil and natural gases. More often than not, subsidence occurs when large quantities of groundwater are removed from sediment or rocks. As groundwater is drawn from deep underground layers of clay, the clay compresses, causing subsidence. In cases of groundwater removal, disruption to land on the surface and underground water storage can either be elastic, meaning recoverable, or inelastic, meaning permanent. Coarse-grained sediment which holds groundwater can be drained and recharged with minimal underground and surface level damage and the change that does occur is considered seasonal subsidence. However, fine-grained sediment takes longer to draw water out of and recharge and if groundwater levels are left low for too long, the compaction of the sediment is permanent and causes irreversible land subsidence. This often occurs due to human interference, but can also happen from natural phenomena. Subsidence can happen over very large areas or small little sections of land. This has occurred along the California Aqueduct of the State Water Project since construction.

Human causes include; pumping, mining and fracking.

Natural causes include; earthquakes, erosion, glacial movement, soil compaction and the formation of sinkholes.

Groundwater use and pumping in the area was the major water use for farmers and agriculture in the 1920s, and over time, this over-pumping resulted in land subsidence and a decline in groundwater-level resources. In time, this resulted in major land subsidence by the 1970s with local areas having of subsidence. With the creation and use of the California Aqueduct along these regions, surface water being transported put a halt on significant compaction and a recovery in ground water levels now with less ground water pumping. The aqueduct has been increasing in subsidence rates rapidly, even though it was relatively stable for many years after being constructed. The Tulare Basin is subsiding at a rate of about 30 cm (one foot) per year, as measured by NASA&#x27;s GRACE satellite. The Central Valley, where a large portion of the California Aqueduct runs through, has been affected by the pumping of groundwater and subsequent land subsidence. Farmers in and near the Central Valley have become reliant on groundwater especially with recent droughts impacting the amount of readily accessible surface water. However, overuse of groundwater can cause irreversible damage. During the 2011-2017 California drought, a record high drought, groundwater and its storage capabilities in the San Joaquin Valley saw a sharp decline. From October 2011 to September 2015 measurements made on groundwater levels in the San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s aquifers recorded a loss of 14 km3/year, a total of 56 km3. During this same period up to 1,000 mm of land subsidence was measured in the San Joaquin Valley. Concerns around groundwater depletion have contributed to legislation to reduce the demand for groundwater and incentivize farmers to use sustainable irrigation practices.

=== Measurement ===
Measurement of this subsidence is done in a few ways. Originally, subsidence was recorded based on land surveying, repeating the surveying, and along with monitoring compaction by recording the data from extensometers at multiple sites. Since then, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) has been used along with land surveying to record subsidence and compaction. More recently, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has been used to monitor subsidence along with GPS. InSAR is being used to recreate maps to closely watch the progression of the land around the aqueduct.

=== Consequences ===
Subsidence can put land, both private and public, at risk of infrastructure damage. Bridges, levees, roads, and groundwater wells are either at risk of damage or have been damaged already. With subsidence progression, underground aquifers could be at risk and water storage from them could be threatened. Damage and sinking of the canal of the aqueduct has already occurred from subsidence which has made the canal less reliable. Capacity has been compromised due to damage to the canals and therefore has caused problems and delays with delivering the water across the state, as well as higher rates and costs for power and operation.

== In popular culture ==
A documentary about the decline of the United States&#x27; infrastructure, &quot;The Crumbling of America&quot;, was commissioned by the U.S. A&amp;E network in the late 2000s. The documentary is typically shown on the History television channel in the United States, although other educational broadcasters globally have shown it. It features the Clifton Court Forebay (a primary intake point for California Aqueduct) as a &quot;strategic piece of California freshwater infrastructure&quot; subject to shutdown for up to two years if struck by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 or greater.

The aqueduct is featured in an episode of &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; with Huell Howser.

<text>Biscayne Bay is a lagoon with characteristics of an estuary located on the Atlantic coast of South Florida. The northern end of the lagoon is surrounded by the densely developed heart of the Miami metropolitan area while the southern end is largely undeveloped with a large portion of the lagoon included in Biscayne National Park. 

The part of the lagoon that is traditionally called &quot;Biscayne Bay&quot; is approximately long and up to wide, with a surface area of . Various definitions may include Dumfoundling Bay, Card Sound, and Barnes Sound in a larger &quot;Biscayne Bay&quot;, which is long with a surface area of about .

==Etymology==
Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda related in the 16th century that a sailor from the Bay of Biscay called the &quot;Viscayno&quot; or &quot;Biscayno&quot; had lived on the lower east coast of Florida for a while after being shipwrecked, and a 17th-century map shows a &quot;Cayo de Biscainhos&quot;, the probable origin of the name for Key Biscayne. The lagoon was known as &quot;Key Biscayne Bay&quot; in the 19th century, finally shrinking to &quot;Biscayne Bay&quot; late in the 19th century.

=== Other names ===
The lagoon has been known by several names. Juan Ponce de León called it &quot;Chequescha&quot; in 1513, and Pedro Menéndez de Avilés called it &quot;Tequesta&quot; in 1565. Those names are variant spellings of &quot;Tequesta&quot;, the name of the people who lived around the lagoon at the time. The British, during their occupation of Florida (1763–1783), called the lagoon &quot;Cape River&quot;, &quot;Dartmouth Sound&quot;, and &quot;Sandwich gulph&quot;.

==Geography==

Biscayne Bay is a semi- or subtropical lagoon extending most of the length of Miami-Dade County, from North Miami Beach to the upper Florida Keys. Biscayne Bay, in the strictest sense, extends from a point between North Miami Beach and Sunny Isles Beach south to the Arsenicker Keys and the Cutter Bank just to the east of those islands. Many discussions about the lagoon include Dumfoundling Bay, a small lagoon just north of North Miami Beach, as part of Biscayne Bay, and include Card Sound and Barnes Sound, in southern Miami-Dade County adjacent to Key Largo, as either part of a system of connected lagoons including Biscayne Bay, or as part of Biscayne Bay itself. The lagoon is bordered on its west by the mainland of Florida, and is separated from the Atlantic Ocean to the east by a string of barrier islands in the northern part of the lagoon, a large shoal in the central section, and the northernmost of the Florida Keys in the south. The lagoon is about long from Dumfoundling Bay (25° 58′ North latitude) (north of North Miami Beach) to Card Sound, and another to Jewfish Creek (25° 24′ North latitude), if Card Sound and Barnes Sound are included in the lagoon. The lagoon is across at its widest point. The lagoon, from Dumfoundling Bay to the Arsenicker Keys, has a surface area of about . The larger lagoon, including Card Sound and Barnes Sound, has a surface area of about . It has an average depth of and, except where channels have been dredged, a maximum depth of .

The eastern rim of the lagoon is based on an ancient coral reef which existed along the southeastern edge of the Florida Platform about 100,000 years ago. The ensuing Wisconsin glaciation lowered sea levels, leaving the reef above water. The dead reef became fossilized, forming the Key Largo Limestone (commonly called &quot;coral rock&quot;). Key Largo Limestone underlies the Eastern edge of the barrier islands and the shoals (Safety Valve) along the northern and middle part of the lagoon. It makes a brief appearance at Soldier Key, in the middle of the Safety Valve, and rises above sea level to the south to form the upper Florida Keys.

The western side of the bay has characteristics of an estuary, with 16 waterways, the largest of which is the Miami River, flowing into it. All of the waterways have saltwater intrusion control structures, which restrict the flow of saltwater inland, and regulate the flow of fresh water into the lagoon. Some fresh water enters the lagoon as groundwater flow from the Biscayne Aquifer. All of the bedrock under the lagoon west of the ancient reef, and the adjacent mainland, consists of Miami Limestone, an oolitic limestone that formed in a lagoon behind the ancient reef that became the Key Largo limestone, and is the same age as the Key Largo limestone. The limestone bottom of the lagoon is overlain by of sand, carbonate mud, and coral rubble sediments.

For purposes of discussion and analysis, Biscayne Bay is often divided into three sections: North Bay, Central Bay, and South Bay.

===North Bay===
The North Bay of Biscayne Bay principally lies between Miami Beach on a barrier island and Miami on the mainland, from Dumfoundling Bay on the north to the Rickenbacker Causeway to the south. Other municipalities on the western shore of the lagoon include Aventura (on Dumfoundling Bay), North Miami Beach, North Miami, and Miami Shores. Municipalities bordering the lagoon on the barrier islands north of Miami Beach include Sunny Isles Beach, Bal Harbour, Bay Harbor Islands, Surfside, and Indian Creek Village. North Bay Village is located on two artificial islands in the middle of the lagoon. North Bay is the part of the lagoon that has been most modified by human works, including channels and other dredged areas, and spoil banks and artificial islands created with material dredged from channels. More than 40% of the area of North Bay had either been dredged or filled to form artificial islands, and more than half of the remaining lagoon bottom is barren. Coastal wetlands have been almost eliminated in North Bay. Turbidity is high in North Bay due to erosion from spoil islands and banks, and the lack of vegetation on the lagoon bottom. The spoil islands host large quantities of invasive plant species.

North Bay is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by barrier islands. Freshwater sources flowing into North Bay include Oleta River, Arch Creek, Biscayne Canal, Little River and Miami River. Tidal flow between North Bay and the ocean is through Baker&#x27;s Haulover Inlet, Government Cut, and Norris Cut.

Northeast 163rd Street, or Sunny Isles Boulevard, connects North Miami Beach and Sunny Isles Beach across the section of the Intracoastal Waterway running between Dumfoundling Bay and Biscayne Bay proper. Five causeways cross North Bay between Northeast 163rd Street and the Rickenbacker Causeway, including:
* Broad Causeway, connecting North Miami and Bal Harbour via the Bay Harbor Islands, 
* John F. Kennedy (79th Street) Causeway, connecting Miami and Miami Beach via North Bay Village, 
* Julia Tuttle Causeway (I-195), connecting Miami and Miami Beach,
* Venetian Causeway, connecting Miami and Miami Beach via the Venetian Islands, and
* MacArthur Causeway, connecting Miami and Miami Beach via Watson Island.

More than 20 islands in North Bay north from the MacArthur Causeway have been created, in whole or in part, with material dredged from the lagoon bottom. Most of the islands, such as the Venetian Islands, are residential. Brickell Key, another residential island, is just south of the mouth of the Miami River. Dodge Island, across the main ship channel to the south of the MacArthur Causeway, was enlarged in the 1960s when the Port of Miami was moved there from the mainland north of Bayfront Park. The Miami Marine Stadium was built on the north side of the Rickenbacker Causeway extending from the east side of Virginia Key in the early 1960s. There are also many undeveloped spoil islands in North Bay, such as Sandspur Island and the Picnic Islands.

===Central Bay===

Central Bay is the largest part of the bay. It extends from the Rickenbacker Causeway and Virginia Key on the north to the Featherbed Bank, which runs across the bay from Black Point to Boca Chita Key. It is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by Key Biscayne, the Safety Valve, and the Ragged Keys, the northernmost of the Florida Keys. It is bordered on the western shore by the municipalities of Miami, Coral Gables, Palmetto Bay, Cutler Bay, and a portion of unincorporated Miami-Dade County. Key Biscayne occupies the middle third of the island on the eastern side of Central Bay. 

Fresh water sources for Central Bay include the Coral Gables Waterway and Snapper Creek. Tidal flow between Central Bay and the ocean is through Bear Cut between Virginia Key and Key Biscayne and across the Safety Valve. The development that has so transformed North Bay has spread over much of the northern shores of Central Bay. Miami Seaquarium and the University of Miami&#x27;s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science are located on the southern end of Virginia Key, the only part of that island bordering on Central Bay. Grove Isle, near the Miami neighborhood of Coconut Grove, is an artificial island in Central Bay. The large marina at Dinner Key is also in Coconut Grove. Central Bay has been adversely affected primarily by bulkheading, urban runoff discharged by canals, and the loss of natural fresh water flow.

===South Bay===

South Bay is nearly as large as Central Bay, and is defined as extending from the Featherbed Bank to the Arsenicker Keys, or to Cutter Bank, which is to the east of the Arsenicker Keys. (Brown et al. define South Bay as consisting of Card Sound and Barnes Sound.) It is separated from the ocean by the northernmost of the Florida Keys, from Boca Chita Key to Old Rhodes Key. Fresh water sources for South Bay include Black Creek, Goulds Canal, North Canal, Florida City Canal, and Model Land Canal. Tidal exchange with the ocean occurs through Sands Cut, Caesar&#x27;s Creek and Broad Creek. Boca Chita Key, Elliott Key, and Old Rhodes Key were all enlarged by dredging in the first half of the 20th century. Boca Chita Key was the site of some construction in the early 20th century. Mark C. Honeywell bought the key in 1937, and built a large retreat on the island, including a tall faux lighthouse. South Bay is the least affected by human activities, although it also suffers from the loss of natural fresh water flow. The Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station is a significant presence on the mainland shore.

====Card Sound and Barnes Sound====
Card Sound is an extension of Biscayne Bay to the south of South Bay. Little Card Sound is the next south, separated from Card Sound by Card Bank. The causeway of the Card Sound Bridge now separates Barnes Sound to the south of Little Card Sound. Manatee Bay is to the west of Barnes Sound. Card Sound and Barnes Sound are bounded on the east by Key Largo. South Biscayne Bay is sometimes defined as including Card Sound and Barnes Sound. Barnes Sound is connected to Florida Bay through a few small channels.

Manatee Bay is partially separated from Barnes Sound by Short Key and Main Key. In 1994, it was described as having particularly undisturbed habitat for a location in the Florida Keys. Due to its distance from the open ocean and the restrictive passages between other components of Biscayne Bay, Manatee Bay experiences low tidal exchange, while the C-197 canal allows fresh water from the C-111 canal to flow into Manatee Bay. Salinity levels in Manatee Bay range from 14 parts-per-thousand (ppt) to 45 ppt (seawater has an average salinity of 35 ppt). In July 2023, the bay was in the news when a bouy there recorded a water temperature of .

===Safety Valve=== 

The Safety Valve is a series of shallow sand flats separated by tidal flow channels, stretching about from the south end of Key Biscayne to the Ragged Keys just north of the Florida Keys. The term &quot;safety valve&quot; was applied to the tidal flats by Ralph Munroe, who argued against building a causeway and bridges connecting Key Biscayne to the Ragged Keys and beyond on the grounds that such construction would block the free outflow of storm surges from the bay across the flats to the ocean. It is believed that it does moderate the effects of storm surges on the bay. The transportation of sand southward along the Atlantic Coast of Florida by longshore drift ends in the area of the Safety Valve. The structure of the Safety Valve has been stable for at least the last century. (The area was called &quot;Bocas de Miguel de Mora&quot; on Spanish maps and &quot;derroteros&quot; during the era of Spanish Florida.) Stiltsville is a collection of buildings on pilings on several sand flats at the northern end of the Safety Valve.
==History==

What is now Biscayne Bay was a freshwater basin 4,000 years ago. As the sea level rose, ocean water entered the basin, turning it into an estuary/lagoon. Before the 20th century, a coastal ridge west of and parallel to the bay caused most of the ground water west of the ridge to flow towards the Everglades and Florida Bay, while ground water on the narrow coastal strip east of the ridge flowed into the bay. Freshwater marshes were located all along the western shore of the bay, and fresh water springs were located along the shore and on the bottom of the bay. Ralph Munroe noted in the late 19th century that potable water could be pumped from one of those bay bottom springs. Springs can still be found in the bay, but the water from them is now brackish.

People lived in the area that is now Biscayne Bay long before the bay was formed. Human bones, teeth, and artifacts that are almost 11,000 years old have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site, a sinkhole that is now a couple of kilometers from the bay. At the time of European contact, in the early 16th century, the area around the bay was occupied by the Tequesta. The Tequesta belonged to the Glades culture, which had been in place for about 2,000 years. The chief town of the Tequesta, also called Tequesta, was on the bay at the mouth of the Miami River, from about 1200. The Miami Circle, just south of the mouth of the Miami River, has been proposed to be post holes for a structure. The site was abandoned in about 1200, when the town site north of the river was occupied.

Juan Ponce de León visited Biscayne Bay in 1513, and Pedro Menéndez de Avilés did so in 1565.

Early accounts by Spanish explorers indicated the existence of one or more inlets somewhere on the long barrier spit then separating the northern end of Biscayne Bay from the ocean (one called &quot;Boca Rattones&quot; appears on the 1770s map by Bernard Romans), but such inlets open and close over time. At the beginning of the 19th century, there was no inlet through the barrier spit between the New River inlet in Fort Lauderdale and Bear Cut, at the south end of what is now Virginia Key. Hurricanes in 1835 and 1838 opened a new inlet, Narrows Cut (now known as Norris Cut), separating Virginia Key from what is now Fisher Island at the south end of Miami Beach.

The opening of Government Cut in 1905 separated Fisher Island from Miami Beach and slightly shortened the barrier spit. The dredging of Baker&#x27;s Haulover Inlet in 1925 across the barrier spit near the north end of the bay converted that part of the barrier spit where Miami Beach was located into a barrier island. Modification of the flow of fresh water through waterways, and the opening of Government Cut and the Baker&#x27;s Haulover Inlet during the 20th century increased the salinity of the lagoon. Dredging of the ship channel and turning basin for the Port of Miami and other navigation channels, including the Intracoastal Waterway, has resulted in the build up of artificial islands in the Northern Bay. more than 40% of the area of North Bay had either been dredged or filled to form artificial islands. Seawalls line almost all of the shoreline of North Bay.

The bay has been severely affected over the last century by raw sewage releases, urban runoff, shoreline bulkheading, dredging, the creation of artificial islands and the loss of natural fresh water flow into the bay. However, water quality has steadily improved since regular monitoring began in 1979. North Bay accounts for only 10% of the water area of the bay.

==Causeways==

The first bridge across Biscayne Bay was the wooden Collins Bridge built in 1912 by John S. Collins and his son-in-law Thomas Pancoast, who formed the Miami Beach Improvement Corporation; financing was provided by Carl G. Fisher and the Miami banker brothers John N. Lummus and James E. Lummus. Construction began on July 22, 1912. Although the cost of the project was initially $75,000, the construction project faced delays and cost overruns. The bridge was partially completed in 1913. The bridge was &quot;hailed as the longest wooden vehicle bridge in the world, and opened up the area as a luxury winter resort and playground.&quot; The bridge terminated at the Dixie Highway, built by Carl G. Fisher. The bridge was a toll bridge; in 1920, the toll was reduced from 20 cents each way (for two-seat cars) to 15 cents one way (and 25 cents round-trip). The bridge was sold to the Biscayne Bay Improvement Association, which developed five artificial islands that became known as the Venetian Islands: Biscayne and San Marco in Miami, San Marino, Di Lido, and Rivo Alto in Miami Beach. The bridge was torn down in 1925 and replaced with the &quot;more substantial&quot; Venetian Causeway the next year.

The Lummus brothers lobbied for the county commission&#x27;s support for a second causeway connecting Miami to the barrier islands of Miami Beach, and the County Causeway—later the MacArthur Causeway—opened on February 17, 1920. In 1925, Biscayne Point was created in Miami Beach&#x27;s north end. In 1929, a third causeway crossed Biscayne Bay at Normandy Isle, which developer Henri Levy had created several years earlier by dredging and filling the south half of Meade Island. The Julia Tuttle Causeway was built in 1959. 
Other causeways are the John F. Kennedy (79th Street) and Broad causeways (connecting the Miami mainland), and the Rickenbacker Causeway (connecting Miami to Key Biscayne). The Card Sound Bridge connects the mainland in the Homestead, Florida area to the northern part of Key Largo.

==Parks and marinas==
Most of Central Bay and almost all of South Bay, as well as the Safety Valve and the Florida Keys north of Key Largo, are within the boundaries of Biscayne National Park. A number of other state and local parks front on the lagoon, primarily on North Bay and the northern rim of Central Bay.

Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park is located on the southern part of Key Biscayne. Oleta River State Park is located on the south side of the Oleta River where it flows into the segment of the Intracoastal Waterway connecting Dumfoundling Bay and North Bay, fronting on North Bay as it widens to the south.

Miami-Dade County operates a number of parks with frontage on Biscayne Bay. Haulover Park is on the barrier island running north from Baker&#x27;s Haulover Inlet. Crandon Park covers the northern part of Key Biscayne. The Vizcaya Museum and Gardens are located on the mainland in Miami near the northern edge of Central Bay. Matheson Hammock Park, the Charles Deering Estate, and Chapman Field Park are on the mainland along the western shore of Central Bay. Black Point Park and Marina and Homestead Bayfront Park are on the mainland on the western shore of South Bay. Black Point, Crandon, Haulover, Homestead Bayfront and Matheson Hammock parks have public marinas. The county also operates Pelican Harbor Marina, which includes a small park. It is located on the John F. Kennedy (79th Street) Causeway in North Bay.

The City of Miami has many parks fronting on the lagoon, the more important of which are Bayfront Park, Alice Wainwright Park, Margaret Pace Park, Maurice A. Ferré Park, Morningside Park, and Peacock Park. Public marinas on Biscayne Bay operated by the City of Miami include: Dinner Key Marina, Miami Marine Stadium Marina, and Miamarina at Bayside.

==Protected areas==
The Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve includes most of Biscayne Bay (in the wider sense) that is not in Biscayne National Park. The preserve was created by the Florida Legislature in 1974, and then included all of Biscayne Bay from the Oleta River to the southern end of Card Sound. The preserve was split into two parts when the Biscayne National Monument became Biscayne National Park. The northern part extends from the headwaters of the Oleta River to the northern boundary of Biscayne National Park, just to the south of Key Biscayne on the east, and just to the south of Chicken Key, part of the Charles Deering Estate, on the west. The southern part of the preserve includes Card Sound. The preserve includes about of submerged land owned by the state. The Biscayne Bay-Cape Florida to Monroe County Line Aquatic Preserve was created in 1975. That preserve ran from Cape Florida to the Miami-Dade County-Monroe County line, and from the limit of Florida territorial waters in the Atlantic to the Intracoastal Waterway in Biscayne Bay. When the Biscayne National Monument was upgraded to a National Park, all waters in the National Park were removed from the Biscayne Bay-Cape Florida to Monroe County Line Aquatic Preserve. The remainder of that preserve consists of about of submerged lands near Key Biscayne. The two preserves are known collectively as the Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserves. Card Sound and Barnes Sound lie within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

The Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge on Key Largo includes of open water in Card Sound and Barnes Sound. Lobsters are protected year-round in the Biscayne Bay-Card Sound Lobster Sanctuary. The sanctuary includes all of the lagoon from a line running from Cape Florida to Matheson Hammock County Park south to the Card Sound Bridge and causeway.

==Threats==
The sea level at Virginia Key has been rising at an average rate of a year from 1931 to 2020, equivalent to 
 a century. The islands adjacent to the lagoon are low-lying and threatened with significant flooding in the near future. Gas and oil exploration wells have been drilled near the lagoon, although none reached exploitable deposits. Canals and quarries have disturbed the bedrock on the shores of the lagoon.

Miami-Dade County operates a landfill at Black Point adjacent to the lagoon.

Miami-Dade County operates three wastewater treatment plants close to the lagoon. The oldest is the Central District Wastewater Treatment Plant on Virginia Key. The North District Wastewater Treatment Plant is in North Miami, and the South District Wastewater Treatment Plant is at Black Point.

<text>The Home Insurance Building was a skyscraper that stood in Chicago from 1885 to its demolition in 1931. Originally ten stories and tall, it was designed by William Le Baron Jenney in 1884 and completed the next year. Two floors were added in 1891, bringing its now finished height to . It was the first tall building to be supported both inside and outside by a fireproof structural steel frame, though it also included reinforced concrete. It is considered the world&#x27;s first skyscraper.

==History==
The building was designed in 1884 by Jenney for the Home Insurance Company. Construction began on May 1, 1884.

Because of the building&#x27;s unique architecture and weight-bearing frame, it is considered the world&#x27;s first skyscraper. It had 10 stories and rose to a height of ; two additional floors were added in 1891, bringing the total to 12 floors, an unprecedented height at the time.

The building weighed one-third as much as a masonry building and city officials were so concerned they halted construction while they investigated its safety.

===Demolition and replacement===
In April 1929 the building was reported as having a 90 percent occupancy rate, compared to an occupancy rate of the surrounding financial district estimated at 96 percent or more. In September 1929 plans were made by Marshall Field&#x27;s to construct a large office building spanning Adams, Clark, and LaSalle Streets. This building would be constructed and opened in parts, the first part occupying the western part of the lot and the site of the Home Insurance Building.

At least six buildings were demolished to make way for the Field Building, including the Home Insurance Building. In 1932, owners placed a plaque in the southwest section of the lobby reading:
This section of the Field Building is erected on the site of the Home Insurance Building, which structure, designed and built in eighteen hundred and eighty four by the late William Le Baron Jenney, was the first high building to utilize as the basic principle of its design the method known as skeleton construction and, being a primal influence in the acceptance of this principle, was the true father of the skyscraper, 1932.

==Status as first skyscraper==

The Home Insurance Building in Chicago is often considered the world&#x27;s first skyscraper due to both its design and height; the building was supported using an iron frame skeleton. It was one of the earliest buildings to use an iron frame skeleton and the tallest to ever do so at the time, rising to ten stories; with an additional two stories added. It was the first multistory building in the United States to largely use iron in its exterior to support the masonry since Badger had constructed similar grain elevators between 1860 and 1862. The status of the Home Insurance Building as the first skyscraper had been accorded by the time of its centennial in 1985.

The Chicago press at the time of its construction did not refer to it as the first skyscraper in Chicago. An 1884 list of buildings considered skyscrapers in Chicago listed three buildings in the city whose final heights would be taller than the Home Insurance Building&#x27;s, although the Home Insurance Building was completed in 1885, a year after the list. Iron framing of multistory buildings had originated in England in the late 18th century and was able to replace exterior load-bearing walls by 1844, but social movements and legal regulations hindered their use at that time. An example is the Ditherington Flax Mill in England, built in 1797, but it was only five stories tall. The Broad Street Station in Philadelphia, a six-story building designed by Wilson Brothers &amp; Company built in 1881, had a structural steel frame and was one of the first buildings in America to use masonry not as structure, but as curtain wall. But at only six stories, it was not considered the world&#x27;s first skyscraper. Chicago and New York each had some lower height structures using iron framing, but they were not fireproof. Later buildings in Chicago were able to solve these problems by supporting the external masonry entirely on the iron frame, which later became the standard worldwide. Peter B. Wright had constructed such a column in Chicago in 1874. Leroy Buffington of Minneapolis developed a system of using wrought iron to frame buildings. However, the design of the Home Insurance Building, supporting the external masonry entirely on the iron frame, was used more by architects worldwide. Buffington later patented his wrought iron to frame design in 1888, but the &quot;Chicago school of architecture&quot; had already begun. Other tall structures completed before the external masonry to iron frame style included the 1882 Montauk Building, also in Chicago, and the 1870 Equitable Life Building in New York. There were also a few other buildings in New York and Chicago of similar height with different architectural designs.

<doc id="549418" wikidata="Q157985" url="?curid=549418" title="Thutmose IV">
<text>Thutmose IV (sometimes read as Thutmosis or Tuthmosis IV, Thothmes in older history works in Latinized Greek; &quot;Thoth is born&quot;) was the 8th Pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt, who ruled in approximately the 14th century BC. His prenomen or royal name, Menkheperure, means &quot;Established in forms is Re.&quot; He was the son of Amenhotep II and Tiaa. Thutmose IV was the grandfather of Akhenaten.

==Life==
Thutmose IV was born to Amenhotep II and Tiaa, but was not actually the crown prince and Amenhotep II&#x27;s chosen successor to the throne. Some scholars speculate that Thutmose ousted his older brother in order to usurp power and then commissioned the Dream Stele in order to justify his unexpected kingship. Thutmose&#x27;s most celebrated accomplishment was the restoration of the Great Sphinx of Giza and subsequent commission of the Dream Stele. According to Thutmose&#x27;s account on the Dream Stele, while the young prince was out on a hunting trip, he stopped to rest under the head of the Sphinx, which was buried up to the neck in sand. He soon fell asleep and had a dream in which the Sphinx told him that if he cleared away the sand and restored it he would become the next pharaoh. After completing the restoration of the Sphinx, he placed a carved stone tablet, now known as the Dream Stele, between the two paws of the Sphinx. The restoration of the Sphinx, and the text of the Dream Stele would then be a piece of propaganda on Thutmose&#x27;s part, meant to bestow legitimacy upon his unexpected kingship. 
Little is known about his brief ten-year rule. He suppressed a minor uprising in Nubia in his 8th year (attested in his Konosso stela) around 1393 BC and was referred to in a stela as the Conqueror of Syria, but little else has been pieced together about his military exploits. Betsy Bryan, who penned a biography of Thutmose IV, says that Thutmose IV&#x27;s Konosso stela appears to refer to a minor desert patrol action on the part of the king&#x27;s forces to protect certain gold-mine routes in Egypt&#x27;s Eastern Desert from occasional attacks by the Nubians. Thutmose IV&#x27;s rule is significant because he established peaceful relations with Mitanni and married a Mitannian princess to seal this new alliance. Thutmose IV&#x27;s role in initiating contact with Egypt&#x27;s former rival, Mitanni, is documented by Amarna letter EA 29 composed decades later by Tushratta, a Mittanian king who ruled during the reign of Akhenaten, Thutmose IV&#x27;s grandson. Tushratta states to Akhenaten that: 
==Dates and length of reign==
Dating the beginning of the reign of Thutmose IV is difficult to do with certainty because he is several generations removed from the astronomical dates which are usually used to calculate Egyptian chronologies, and the debate over the proper interpretation of these observances has not been settled. Thutmose&#x27;s grandfather Thutmose III almost certainly acceded the throne in either 1504 or 1479, based upon two lunar observances during his reign, and ruled for nearly 54 years. His successor Amenhotep II, Thutmose IV&#x27;s father, took the throne and ruled for at least 26 years but has been assigned up to 35 years in some chronological reconstructions. The currently preferred reconstruction, after analyzing all this evidence, usually comes to an accession date around 1401 BC or 1400 BC for the beginning of Thutmose IV&#x27;s reign.

The length of his reign is not clear. He is usually given about nine or ten years of reign. Manetho credits him a reign of 9 years and 8 months. However, Manetho&#x27;s other figures for the 18th Dynasty are frequently assigned to the wrong kings or simply incorrect, so monumental evidence is also used to determine his reign length. Of all of Thutmose IV&#x27;s dated monuments, three date to his first regnal year, one to his fourth, possibly one to his fifth, one to his sixth, two to his seventh, and one to his eighth. Two other dated objects, one dated to a Year 19 and another year 20, have been suggested as possibly belonging to him, but neither have been accepted as dating to his reign. The readings of the king&#x27;s name in these dates are today accepted as referring to the prenomen of Thutmose III—Menkheperre—and not Menkhepe[ru]re Thutmose IV himself. Due to the absence of higher dates for Thutmose IV after his Year 8 Konosso stela, Manetho&#x27;s figures here are usually accepted. There were once chronological reconstructions which gave him a reign as long as 34–35 years. Today, however, most scholars ascribe him a 10-year reign from 1401 to 1392 BC, within a small margin of error.
==Monuments==
Like most of the Thutmoside kings, he built on a grand scale. Thutmose IV completed the eastern obelisk at the Temple of Karnak started by Thutmose III, which, at , was the tallest obelisk ever erected in Egypt. Thutmose IV called it the &quot;tekhen waty&quot; or &#x27;unique obelisk.&#x27; It was transported to the grounds of the Circus Maximus in Rome by Emperor Constantius II in 357 AD and, later, &quot;re-erected by Pope Sixtus V in 1588 at the Piazza San Giovanni&quot; where it is today known as the Lateran Obelisk.

Thutmose IV also built a unique chapel and peristyle hall against the back or eastern walls of the main Karnak temple building. The chapel was intended for people &quot;who had no right of access to the main [Karnak] temple. It was a &#x27;place of the ear&#x27; for the god Amun where the god could hear the prayers of the townspeople.&quot; This small alabaster chapel and peristyle hall of Thutmose IV has today been carefully restored by French scholars from the &quot;Centre Franco-Egyptien D&#x27;Étude des Temple de Karnak&quot; (CFEETK) mission in Karnak.

== Burial and mummy ==

Thutmose IV was buried in tomb KV43 the Valley of the Kings but his body was later moved to the mummy cache in KV35, where it was discovered by Victor Loret in 1898. An examination of his mummy conducted by Grafton Elliot Smith revealed that he was extremely emaciated at the time of his death. His height was given as but considering that the feet have been broken off post-mortem, his height in life would have been taller. The forearms are crossed over the chest, right over left. His hair, which is parted in the middle, is about long and dark reddish-brown. His ears are also pierced. Elliot Smith estimated his age to be 25–28 years or possibly older. He was succeeded to the throne by his son, Amenhotep III.

In 1980, James Harris and Edward F. Wente conducted X-ray examinations of New Kingdom Pharaoh&#x27;s crania and skeletal remains, which included the mummified remains of Thutmose IV. The authors noted royal mummies like Thutmose IV showed features characteristic of North Mediterranean populations, or the Western World. 

In 2012 a surgeon at Imperial College London analysed the early death of Thutmose IV and the premature deaths of other Eighteenth Dynasty pharaohs (including Tutankhamun and Akhenaten). He concludes that their early deaths were likely as a result of a familial temporal epilepsy. This would account for both the untimely death of Thutmose IV and also his religious vision described on the Dream Stele, due to this type of epilepsy&#x27;s association with intense spiritual visions and religiosity.

His mummy has the inventory number CG 61073. In April 2021 his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.

<text>Maleme () is a small village and civilian airfield to the west of Chania, in north western Crete, Greece. It is located in Platanias municipality, in Chania regional unit.

==History==

===Bronze Age===
A Late Minoan tholos tomb has been discovered in the vicinity of Maleme. The tholos tomb, located on &quot;Kafkala&quot; hill, was accidentally revealed and then looted at the beginning of the 20th century. During World War II a bomb caused the partial destruction of its roof and the backfill of the chamber. It is a significant funerary monument excavated in 1966 by the curator Mr. C. Davaras and partly restored in 1970. It dates back to the Late Minoan III A-B era (14th-13th c. B.C.). A corridor (&quot;dromos&quot;), 25.10m long and 1.60m wide, leads to the chamber. A step in the middle separates the dromos into two parts. The walls are coated with coarse stones, while a slim layer of reddish mortar covered its floor. There is a large lintel over the entrance to the chamber (2m high and 1.60m wide) and a relieving triangle, open to the chamber and covered with a slab on the front. The stone threshold bears two sockets for the reception of pivots of a wooden gate. The chamber was finally blocked with a stone walling.

The burial chamber, very carefully built with large porous stones, square in ground plan (4.36m x 4.46m), should have ended in a pyramidal roof. Its floor consisted of pebbles knitted together with lime mortar, while parts of the walls were coated with ivory-coloured mortar. Just two seal stones have been preserved among the grave goods, one made of copper, the other made of agate, together with some pot fragments.

===World War II===
Maleme is best known as a landing site for German paratroopers invading Crete in 1941, at the start of the Battle of Crete (&quot;Operation Mercury&quot;) during World War II. The paratroopers captured the airstrip, which was located just outside the town. Once captured, this airstrip allowed the Germans to airlift in the reinforcements needed to capture the rest of the island. Many of the paratroopers lost their lives in the attack and are buried in the German war cemetery () located on a hill above Maleme.

There is a Royal Air Force (RAF) memorial to the airmen of 30 and 33 Squadrons who died during the battle. The memorial is located () behind the roadside hedge between Maleme and Tavronitis overlooking the () Iron Bridge across the Tavronitis River and the end of Maleme aerodrome.

<text>The crested gecko (Correlophus ciliatus), also known commonly as the eyelash gecko, is a species of lizard in the family Diplodactylidae. The species is native to southern New Caledonia. In 1866, the crested gecko was originally described by French zoologist Alphonse Guichenot. The species was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994 during an expedition led by German herpetologist . Along with several other New Caledonian gecko species, it is being considered for protected status by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1866 as &quot;Correlophus ciliatus&quot; by the Guichenot in an article entitled &quot;&quot;Notice sur un nouveau genre de sauriens de la famille des geckotiens du Muséum de Paris&quot; [Notice of a new genus of saurians of the gecko family from the Paris Museum]&quot; in the &quot;Mémoires de la Société Scientifique Naturelle de Chérbourg&quot;.

It was later renamed &quot;Rhacodactylus ciliatus&quot; in 1883. Recent phylogenetic analysis indicates that &quot;R. ciliatus&quot; and &quot;R. sarasinorum&quot; are not closely related to each other. So 55 species have been reclassified from the genus &quot;Rhacodactylus&quot; back to the genus &quot;Correlophus&quot;.

The specific name, &quot;ciliatus&quot;, is Latin, from &quot;cilia&quot; (&quot;fringe&quot; or &quot;eyelashes&quot;) and refers to the crest of skin over the animal&#x27;s eyes that resembles eyelashes.

==Geographic distribution==
The crested gecko is endemic to South Province, New Caledonia. There are three disjunct populations, one on the Isle of Pines and surrounding islets, and two on the main island of Grande Terre. On Grande Terre, one population is around the Blue River, which is a protected provincial park, and the other is farther north, just south of Mount Dzumac.

==Physical description==

The crested gecko usually measures in total length, including of tail length. Among the most distinctive features of this gecko are the hair-like projections found above the eyes, which greatly resemble eyelashes. These projections continue as two rows of spines that run from the eyes to the sides of the wedge-shaped head and continue to the base of the tail. The crested gecko does not have eyelids. Instead, a transparent scale, or spectacle, keeps each eye moist, and the gecko uses its tongue to clear away debris.

&quot;C. ciliatus&quot; possesses a semi-prehensile tail which it uses to assist in climbing. The tail can be dropped (via caudal autotomy) to distract predators. The crested gecko does not regenerate its tail once lost. Most adults in the wild lack tails.

The toes and the tip of the semi-prehensile tail are covered in small hairs called setae. Each seta is divided into hundreds of smaller (approximately 200 nanometres in diameter) hairs called spatulae. It is believed these structures exploit the weak van der Waals force, to help the gecko climb on most solid surfaces, most easily on flatter, smoother surfaces such as glass or wood. The toes have small claws which aid in climbing surfaces to which its toes cannot cling.

The crested gecko has many naturally occurring color groups, including grey, brown, red, orange, and yellow of various shades. It has three color morphs in the wild: pattern-less, white-fringed, and tiger.

==Ecology==

===Habitat and Behavior===
 The crested gecko is a mostly arboreal species, preferring to inhabit the canopy of the New Caledonia rainforests. It is able to jump long distances between branches to move to new locations. It is nocturnal, and will generally spend the daylight hours sleeping in secure spots in high branches. 

===Diet===
The crested gecko is an omnivore, and will opportunistically feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, and a variety of insects.

=== Reproduction ===
Little is known about the wild reproductive behavior of the crested gecko. Available information has been obtained from captive animals. Females generally lay two eggs per clutch, which hatch 60–150 days after they are laid. A female crested gecko only has to mate with a male once in order to lay 2 eggs every 4–6 weeks for a breeding cycle of upwards of 8–10 months. After a breeding cycle, females in the wild go through a &quot;cooling&quot; cycle, usually prompted by slight temperature and daylight changes over the winter season. During this time, the females are able to regain the body mass and nutrients they lost during egg-laying.

The crested gecko has two small sacs for calcium on the roof of its mouth. If an egg-laying female does not have enough calcium her sac will be depleted, and she can suffer from calcium deficiency. This can lead to a calcium crash, in which the female appears shaky or wobbly, lethargic, has a lack of appetite, and can even result in death.

Newly hatched crested geckos will generally not eat until after they have shed and eaten their skin for the first time, having relied until then on the remains of their yolk sack for nutrition.

==Conservation==
The crested gecko was believed to be extinct prior to rediscovery in 1994. The species is currently being assessed for CITES protection and vulnerable status. The biggest single threat to the wild population appears to be the introduction of the little fire ant (&quot;Wassmania auropunctata&quot;) to New Caledonia. This ant species preys on the crested gecko, stinging and attacking in very large numbers, and it also competes with the crested gecko for food by preying on arthropods. Other threats to the wild population include habitat damage from wildfires, rodent predation, and habitat degradation from introduced deer and pigs.

==As a pet==

Though the export of wild specimens of the crested gecko is now prohibited, biologists exported several specimens for breeding and study before New Caledonia stopped issuing permits to export the species. From these specimens, different breeding lines were established, both in Europe and the United States. The crested gecko is now one of the most widely-kept and bred species of gecko in the world, second only to the common leopard gecko.

The crested gecko can be very long-lived. While it has not been kept in captivity long enough for a definitive life span to be determined, it has been kept for 15–20 years or more.

<doc id="549443" wikidata="Q326303" url="?curid=549443" title="Montreal Convention">
<text>The Montreal Convention (formally, the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air) is a multilateral treaty adopted by a diplomatic meeting of ICAO member states in 1999. It amended important provisions of the Warsaw Convention&#x27;s regime concerning compensation for the victims of air disasters. The Convention attempts to re-establish uniformity and predictability of rules relating to the international carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo. Whilst maintaining the core provisions which have served the international air transport community for several decades (i.e., the Warsaw regime), the treaty achieves modernization in a number of key areas. It protects passengers by introducing a two-tier liability system that eliminates the previous requirement of proving willful neglect by the air carrier to obtain more than US$75,000 in damages, which should eliminate or reduce protracted litigation.

== Damages ==

Under the Montreal Convention, air carriers are strictly liable for proven damages up to 128,821.00 special drawing rights (SDR), a mix of currency values established by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) equal to roughly US$175,000. Where damages of more than 128,821.00 SDR are sought, the airline may avoid liability by proving that the accident which caused the injury or death was not due to their negligence or was attributable solely to the negligence of a third party. This defense is not available where damages of less than 128,821.00 SDR are sought. The convention also amended the jurisdictional provisions of Warsaw and now allows the victim or their families to sue foreign carriers where they maintain their principal residence, and requires all air carriers to carry liability insurance.

The main goal of the Montreal Convention was to increase available damages in relation to death or injury of passengers from the limited and outdated limits under the Warsaw/Hague Convention.

== No compensation purely for psychiatric injury ==

The Convention does not recognize compensation for psychiatric injury or damage unless linked to physical injury. Article 17 of the Convention refers to &quot;bodily injury&quot; in setting out the liability of the carrier for accidents. Purely psychiatric injury is not eligible for compensation which has been criticised by people injured in plane accidents, legal experts and their families.

=== Australia ===
Australia amended its law to adopt concepts in the Montreal Convention including:

* the removal of references to &#x27;personal injury&#x27; and replaced with &#x27;bodily injury&#x27; under the CACL Act to ensure consistency with the 1999 Montreal Convention concerning international flights;
* the preclusion of potential claimants from claiming compensation for mental injuries where that person has not suffered additional personal or property damage

Independent Australian senator Nick Xenophon introduced a private member&#x27;s bill into the Australian Parliament in May 2015 which sought to protect the rights of plane crash survivors to be compensated for psychological trauma.

Leading Australian current affairs TV show 4 Corners on the government owned broadcaster ABC, broadcast a program focusing on the unfairness and injustice of excluding psychiatric injury on 23 March 2015 featuring Karen Casey, a nurse injured when the medical evacuation flight she was nursing on crashed in the waters off Norfolk Island.

== Lost baggage ==

The Montreal Convention changes and generally increases the maximum liability of airlines for lost baggage to a fixed amount 1,288 SDR per passenger (the amount in the Warsaw Convention is based on weight of the baggage). It requires airlines to fully compensate travelers the cost of replacement items purchased until the baggage is delivered, to a maximum of 1,288 SDR. At 21 days any delayed baggage is considered lost, until the airline finds and delivers it.

== Disabled passengers and mobility equipment ==

The limitation of compensation for damage to baggage to 1,288 SDRs means that the value of damaged mobility equipment may often significantly exceed available compensation under the Montreal Convention, while the effect of the loss, even temporarily, of mobility equipment places disabled passengers at a substantially increased disadvantage in comparison to other passengers suffering damaged baggage. While for non-disabled people the major issue is the loss of hold baggage, for disabled people the problem tends to be physical damage to wheelchairs and other durable medical equipment due to inappropriate stowage in the hold. Even a basic individually-fitted wheelchair may cost twice the available compensation, with a three-month lead time for replacement. There have been further problems with airlines being reluctant to recognise that cheap mass-market wheelchairs may be unsuitable as even a temporary replacement due to the common need for customised seating solutions among long-term wheelchair users.

The EU in &quot;Communication on the scope of the liability of air carriers and airports in the event of destroyed, damaged or lost mobility equipment of passengers with reduced mobility when traveling by air&quot; notes this disadvantage in relation to EC 1107/2006 &quot;rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when traveling by air&quot;.

The EU report notes that the United States under the Air Carrier Access Act and Canada under Part VII of the Air Transport Regulations have taken action to force airlines to fully cover the costs of damage to mobility equipment as a condition of allowing an airline to operate in their airspace, and notes that the EU may have to take similar steps if the additional duties imposed on airlines by EC 1107/2006 do not resolve the issue.

== Ratifications ==
As September 2018, there are 133 parties to the convention. Included in this total is 132 of the 191 ICAO Member States plus the European Union. The states that have ratified represent 131 UN member states plus the Cook Islands. Other states that have ratified include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, all member states of the European Union, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Nepal, Norway, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States.

<text>In the mathematical area of order theory, completeness properties assert the existence of certain infima or suprema of a given partially ordered set (poset). The most familiar example is the completeness of the real numbers. A special use of the term refers to complete partial orders or complete lattices. However, many other interesting notions of completeness exist.

The motivation for considering completeness properties derives from the great importance of suprema (least upper bounds, joins, &quot;formula_1&quot;) and infima (greatest lower bounds, meets, &quot;formula_2&quot;) to the theory of partial orders. Finding a supremum means to single out one distinguished least element from the set of upper bounds. On the one hand, these special elements often embody certain concrete properties that are interesting for the given application (such as being the least common multiple of a set of numbers or the union of a collection of sets). On the other hand, the knowledge that certain types of subsets are guaranteed to have suprema or infima enables us to consider the evaluation of these elements as &quot;total operations&quot; on a partially ordered set. For this reason, posets with certain completeness properties can often be described as algebraic structures of a certain kind. In addition, studying the properties of the newly obtained operations yields further interesting subjects.

==Types of completeness properties==

All completeness properties are described along a similar scheme: one describes a certain class of subsets of a partially ordered set that are required to have a supremum or required to have an infimum. Hence every completeness property has its dual, obtained by inverting the order-dependent definitions in the given statement. Some of the notions are usually not dualized while others may be self-dual (i.e. equivalent to their dual statements).

===Least and greatest elements===

The easiest example of a supremum is the empty one, i.e. the supremum of the empty set. By definition, this is the least element among all elements that are greater than each member of the empty set. But this is just the least element of the whole poset, if it has one, since the empty subset of a poset &quot;P&quot; is conventionally considered to be both bounded from above and from below, with every element of &quot;P&quot; being both an upper and lower bound of the empty subset. Other common names for the least element are bottom and zero (0). The dual notion, the empty lower bound, is the greatest element, top, or unit (1).

Posets that have a bottom are sometimes called pointed, while posets with a top are called unital or topped. An order that has both a least and a greatest element is bounded. However, this should not be confused with the notion of &quot;bounded completeness&quot; given below.

===Finite completeness===

Further simple completeness conditions arise from the consideration of all non-empty finite sets. An order in which all non-empty finite sets have both a supremum and an infimum is called a lattice. It suffices to require that all suprema and infima of &quot;two&quot; elements exist to obtain all non-empty finite ones; a straightforward induction argument shows that every finite non-empty supremum/infimum can be decomposed into a finite number of binary suprema/infima. Thus the central operations of lattices are binary suprema formula_1 and infima It is in this context that the terms meet for formula_2 and join for formula_1 are most common.

A poset in which only non-empty finite suprema are known to exist is therefore called a join-semilattice. The dual notion is meet-semilattice.

===Further completeness conditions===

The strongest form of completeness is the existence of all suprema and all infima. The posets with this property are the complete lattices. However, using the given order, one can restrict to further classes of (possibly infinite) subsets, that do not yield this strong completeness at once.

If all directed subsets of a poset have a supremum, then the order is a directed-complete partial order (dcpo). These are especially important in domain theory. The seldom-considered dual notion to a dcpo is the filtered-complete poset. Dcpos with a least element (&quot;pointed dcpos&quot;) are one of the possible meanings of the phrase complete partial order (cpo).

If every subset that has &quot;some&quot; upper bound has also a least upper bound, then the respective poset is called bounded complete. The term is used widely with this definition that focuses on suprema and there is no common name for the dual property. However, bounded completeness can be expressed in terms of other completeness conditions that are easily dualized (see below). Although concepts with the names &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;bounded&quot; were already defined, confusion is unlikely to occur since one would rarely speak of a &quot;bounded complete poset&quot; when meaning a &quot;bounded cpo&quot; (which is just a &quot;cpo with greatest element&quot;). Likewise, &quot;bounded complete lattice&quot; is almost unambiguous, since one would not state the boundedness property for complete lattices, where it is implied anyway. Also note that the empty set usually has upper bounds (if the poset is non-empty) and thus a bounded-complete poset has a least element.

One may also consider the subsets of a poset which are totally ordered, i.e. the chains. If all chains have a supremum, the order is called chain complete. Again, this concept is rarely needed in the dual form.

==Relationships between completeness properties==

It was already observed that binary meets/joins yield all non-empty finite meets/joins. Likewise, many other (combinations) of the above conditions are equivalent.

* The best-known example is the existence of all suprema, which is in fact equivalent to the existence of all infima. Indeed, for any subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset, one can consider its set of lower bounds &quot;B&quot;. The supremum of &quot;B&quot; is then equal to the infimum of &quot;X&quot;: since each element of &quot;X&quot; is an upper bound of &quot;B&quot;, sup &quot;B&quot; is smaller than all elements of &quot;X&quot;, i.e. sup &quot;B&quot; is in &quot;B&quot;. It is the greatest element of &quot;B&quot; and hence the infimum of &quot;X&quot;. In a dual way, the existence of all infima implies the existence of all suprema.
* Bounded completeness can also be characterized differently. By an argument similar to the above, one finds that the supremum of a set with upper bounds is the infimum of the set of upper bounds. Consequently, bounded completeness is equivalent to the existence of all non-empty infima.
* A poset is a complete lattice if and only if it is a cpo and a join-semilattice. Indeed, for any subset &quot;X&quot;, the set of all finite suprema (joins) of &quot;X&quot; is directed and the supremum of this set (which exists by directed completeness) is equal to the supremum of &quot;X&quot;. Thus every set has a supremum and by the above observation we have a complete lattice. The other direction of the proof is trivial.
* Assuming the axiom of choice, a poset is chain complete if and only if it is a dcpo.

==Completeness in terms of universal algebra==

As explained above, the presence of certain completeness conditions allows to regard the formation of certain suprema and infima as total operations of a partially ordered set. It turns out that in many cases it is possible to characterize completeness solely by considering appropriate algebraic structures in the sense of universal algebra, which are equipped with operations like formula_1 or formula_2. By imposing additional conditions (in form of suitable identities) on these operations, one can then indeed derive the underlying partial order exclusively from such algebraic structures. Details on this characterization can be found in the articles on the &quot;lattice-like&quot; structures for which this is typically considered: see semilattice, lattice, Heyting algebra, and Boolean algebra. Note that the latter two structures extend the application of these principles beyond mere completeness requirements by introducing an additional operation of &quot;negation&quot;.

==Completeness in terms of adjunctions==

Another interesting way to characterize completeness properties is provided through the concept of (monotone) Galois connections, i.e. adjunctions between partial orders. In fact this approach offers additional insights both into the nature of many completeness properties and into the importance of Galois connections for order theory. The general observation on which this reformulation of completeness is based is that the construction of certain suprema or infima provides left or right adjoint parts of suitable Galois connections.

Consider a partially ordered set (&quot;X&quot;, ≤). As a first simple example, let 1 = {*} be a specified one-element set with the only possible partial ordering. There is an obvious mapping &quot;j&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → 1 with &quot;j&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = * for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. &quot;X&quot; has a least element if and only if the function &quot;j&quot; has a lower adjoint &quot;j&quot;*: 1 → &quot;X&quot;. Indeed the definition for Galois connections yields that in this case &quot;j&quot;*(*) ≤ &quot;x&quot; if and only if * ≤ &quot;j&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), where the right hand side obviously holds for any &quot;x&quot;. Dually, the existence of an upper adjoint for &quot;j&quot; is equivalent to &quot;X&quot; having a greatest element.

Another simple mapping is the function &quot;q&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; × &quot;X&quot; given by &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot;). Naturally, the intended ordering relation for &quot;X&quot; × &quot;X&quot; is just the usual product order. &quot;q&quot; has a lower adjoint &quot;q&quot;* if and only if all binary joins in &quot;X&quot; exist. Conversely, the join operation formula_1: &quot;X&quot; × &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; can always provide the (necessarily unique) lower adjoint for &quot;q&quot;. Dually, &quot;q&quot; allows for an upper adjoint if and only if &quot;X&quot; has all binary meets. Thus the meet operation formula_2, if it exists, always is an upper adjoint. If both formula_1 and formula_2 exist and, in addition, formula_2 is also a lower adjoint, then the poset &quot;X&quot; is a Heyting algebra—another important special class of partial orders.

Further completeness statements can be obtained by exploiting suitable completion procedures. For example, it is well known that the collection of all lower sets of a poset &quot;X&quot;, ordered by subset inclusion, yields a complete lattice D(&quot;X&quot;) (the downset-lattice). Furthermore, there is an obvious embedding &quot;e&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → D(&quot;X&quot;) that maps each element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;X&quot; to its principal ideal {&quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot; | &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;}. A little reflection now shows that &quot;e&quot; has a lower adjoint if and only if &quot;X&quot; is a complete lattice. In fact, this lower adjoint will map any lower set of &quot;X&quot; to its supremum in &quot;X&quot;. Composing this lower adjoint with the function that maps any subset of &quot;X&quot; to its lower closure (again an adjunction for the inclusion of lower sets in the powerset), one obtains the usual supremum map from the powerset 2&quot;X&quot; to &quot;X&quot;. As before, another important situation occurs whenever this supremum map is also an upper adjoint: in this case the complete lattice &quot;X&quot; is &quot;constructively completely distributive&quot;. See also the articles on complete distributivity and distributivity (order theory).

The considerations in this section suggest a reformulation of (parts of) order theory in terms of category theory, where properties are usually expressed by referring to the relationships (morphisms, more specifically: adjunctions) between objects, instead of considering their internal structure. For more detailed considerations of this relationship see the article on the categorical formulation of order theory.

<text>Fire eating is the act of putting a flaming object into the mouth and extinguishing it. A fire eater can be an entertainer, a street performer, part of a sideshow or a circus act but has also been part of spiritual tradition in India.

==Physics and hazards==
Fire eating relies on the quick extinguishing of the fire in the mouth or on the touched surfaces and on the short term cooling effects of water evaporation at the surface on the source of fire (usually with a low percentage of alcohol mixed in the water) or saliva in the mouth. This allows for igniting a damp handkerchief or a bill of money without it burning. Closing the mouth, or covering it with a slap of the hand cuts off the oxygen to the fire. Blowing on it can remove the very thin area of reaction from the source of fuel, and thus extinguish the fire in some cases, where the blown air is faster than the fire front and the flame is small enough to be entirely removed.

Contrary to what many may assume, the flame itself is not a cold flame. This can be proven by a number of things. For starters, a cold flame can only be visible in total darkness, but many flame eating tricks happen in the light. Also, a cold flame is a chemical flame that can&#x27;t be formed using a traditional torch. Certain materials are avoided when doing the trick, such as materials which may easily ignite, melt or store the heat and release it later. These include paraffin candles, plastic, and thick multithreaded rope.

According to Daniel Mannix&#x27;s 1951 sideshow memoir &quot;Step right up!&quot;, the real &quot;secret&quot; to fire eating is enduring pain; he mentions that tolerating constant blisters on your tongue, lips and throat is also necessary. Many other fire eaters dismiss this, claiming that skilled fire eaters should not burn themselves. The most common method of safely performing fire eating acts relies on the fact that it takes time to transfer heat, and that heat rises in air. Fire eating and fire breathing (and all variants) is a skill which should be passed on from a skilled master to an appropriate student and almost all teachings include instructions on first aid, fire safety, chemistry and other appropriate skills. Accidental ingestion of fuel or improper technique can lead to a serious condition known as fire eater&#x27;s pneumonia.

Even professional eating artists still face slight injuries every time they perform the trick. If all goes well in the trick, the artist will still end up getting slightly poisoned by their fuel, developing small blisters within their mouth, and constantly having awful headaches from the fuel. It has also been found to be dangerous to inhale hydrocarbons from flames because they can cause many of the issues listed above. Dealing with these issues is also explained in depth by a video on homeofpopoi.com. It should certainly be made apparent that fire eating can also cause long term health effects especially if done incorrectly.

==History==
Fire eating was a common part of Hindu, Sadhu, and Fakir performances to show spiritual attainment. It became a part of the standard sideshow acts in the late 1880s and was often seen as one of the entry-level skills for sideshow performers.

Although not the earliest, the first to attract the attention of the upper classes was an Englishman named Richardson, who first performed in France in 1667. Richardson &quot;munched glowing coals, drank flaming liquids, and otherwise appeared to prove that he was unharmed by fire&quot;. His methods were subsequently made public by his servant.

A famous fire eater from the 18th century was Robert Powell who allegedly not only swallowed fire but also red-hot coals, melted sealing wax and even brimstone. He performed, often in front of British and other European royalty and nobility, for nearly sixty years and, in 1751, was awarded a purse of gold and a large silver medal. Other fire eaters include the magicians Ching Ling Foo and Daniel P. Mannix.

==Guinness World Records==

The most torches extinguished in one minute with the mouth (using multiple rods) is 99 and was achieved by Bret Pasek (U.S.) at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival in Shakopee, Minnesota, on 7 September 2014.

In 2018, this record was later beaten by a man named Brant Matthews who extinguished 101 torches in the same minute time frame.

According to Stanford University political scientists Adam Bonica and Michael McFaul, there is a consensus among political scientists that &quot;democracies perform better when more people vote.&quot;

Institutional factors drive the vast majority of differences in turnout rates. For example, simpler parliamentary democracies where voters get shorter ballots, fewer elections, and a multi-party system that makes accountability easier see much higher turnout than the systems of the United States, Japan, and Switzerland.

==Significance==
Some parts of society are more likely to vote than others. As turnout approaches 90%, significant differences between voters and nonvoters lessen, but in lower turnout elections the differences between voters and nonvoters can be dramatic.

More importantly than changes in specific election outcomes, voter turnout has seismic long-term implications on the abilities of democracies to function. For example, regulatory capture tends to afflict low-turnout democracies more, blocking popular democratic reforms like streamlining elections.

==Institutional factors==
Institutional factors have the most significant impact on voter turnout. Making voting compulsory has a direct and dramatic effect on turnout while adding barriers, such as a separate registration process or unnecessarily scheduling many elections, suppresses turnout. In addition, the closer democracies are to &#x27;one person, one vote&#x27; increases turnout as voters see that their effort has an impact. This can be seen in the higher turnout rates of proportional parliamentary democracies.

=== Ease of voting ===
Other methods of making voting easier to increase turnout include vote-by-mail, absentee polling and improved access to polls, such as increasing the number of possible voting locations, lowering the average time voters wait in line, or requiring companies to give workers some time off on voting day. A 2017 study found that turnout among older voters increases the earlier polling places open, while turnout among younger voters improves the longer polling places stay open.

=== Voter fatigue ===

If there are many elections in close succession, voter turnout tends to decrease as the public tires of participating. In low-turnout Switzerland, the average voter is invited to go to the polls an average of seven times a year; the United States has frequent elections, with two votes per year on average (e.g. local government and primaries). Eliminating off-cycle elections boosts turnout while being popular with voters. Another form of voter fatigue occurs when voters are asked to weigh-in on dozens of contests, as occurs in some parts of the United States.

=== Voter registration ===
In the United States and most Latin American nations, voters must go through separate voter registration procedures before they are allowed to vote. This two-step process quite clearly decreases turnout. US states with no, or easier, registration requirements have larger turnouts.

A country with a highly efficient registration process is France. At the age of eighteen, all youth are automatically registered. Only new residents and citizens who have moved are responsible for bearing the costs and inconvenience of updating their registration. Similarly, in Nordic countries, all citizens and residents are included in the official population register, which is simultaneously a tax list, voter registration, and membership in the universal health system. Residents are required by law to report any change of address to the register within a short time after moving. This is also the system in Germany (but without the membership in the health system).
Spain has also a similar system called &quot;Padrón Municipal de Habitantes&quot;, held by municipalities. Persons register themselves in the Padrón as local residents (every resident in Spain must be registered in any municipality). The Padrón is used for providing most local, regional, and national government services. It also serves as the electoral register. In order to avoid duplications and to gather statistics on demography, the Padrón is supervised by a national government agency, the Instituto National de Estatística (INE). La Oficina Electoral del Censo is the bureau, as part of the INE, responsible for compiling the electoral roll. Every Spanish citizen or EU resident, older than 18 years, is automatically included in the voter register.

=== Compulsory voting ===

A strong factor affecting voter turnout is whether voting is compulsory, as countries that enforce compulsory voting tend to have far higher voter turnout rates. For example, in Australia, voter registration and attendance at a polling booth have been mandatory since the 1920s, with the 2016 federal election having turnout figures of 91% for the House of Representatives and 91.9% for the Senate. In Singapore, turnout at the 2020 general election was 95.81%, the highest since 1997 where it was 95.91%. This was an increase from the record low of 93.06% at the 2011 general election.

Penalties for failing to vote are not always strictly enforced, and sanctions for non-voters are often mild. For instance, while voting is nominally compulsory in Greece for adults up to 70 years of age, no one has ever been prosecuted for failing to vote, with voter turnout rates reaching as low as 57% in the September 2015 Greek legislative election. In Australia, people who do not vote are subject to a small fine, which is easily waived if one of many acceptable excuses for failing to vote is provided. In Bolivia, however, if a voter fails to participate in an election, they may be denied withdrawal of their salary from the bank for three months.

=== Salience ===
Mark N. Franklin argues that salience, the perceived effect that an individual vote will have on how the country is run, has a significant effect on turnout. He presents Switzerland as an example of a nation with low salience. The nation&#x27;s administration is highly decentralized, so that the federal government has limited powers. Important decisions are also placed before the population in a referendum. Individual votes for the federal legislature are thus less likely to have a significant effect on the complex web of systems, which probably explains some of the low average turnouts in that more complicated democracy. By contrast Malta, with one of the world&#x27;s highest voter turnouts, has a single legislature that holds most political power. Malta has a two-party system in which a small swing in votes can significantly alter the executive. Voters&#x27; perceptions of fairness also have an important effect on salience, where fears of fraud and corruption can suppress turnout. Minority voters are shown to mobilize when issues pertaining to their group identity become politically salient.

==== Proportionality ====
Since most votes count in proportional representation systems, there are fewer &quot;wasted votes&quot;, so voters, aware that their vote can make a difference, are more likely to make the effort to vote, and less likely to vote tactically. Compared to countries with plurality electoral systems, voter turnout improves and the population is more involved in the political process in ~70% of cases. The exceptions to the rule can include cases where a plurality system has an unusually high number of competitive districts, for example, before it transitions to a proportional one.

==Measuring turnout==

Differing methods of measuring voter turnout can contribute to reported differences between nations. There are difficulties in measuring both the numerator, the number of voters who cast votes, and the denominator, the number of voters eligible to vote. In Sweden, validated individual-level turnout data is available for a subset of general and European Parliament elections, taken from Swedish election registers.

===Numerator (e.g. ballots cast)===

==== Possible metrics ====

&quot;From largest to smallest&quot;

Signed-in: includes people who signed-in at the polls, but did not cast a ballot.

Ballots Cast: Total number of ballots cast, regardless of how many were filled-out or accepted.

Ballots Accepted: this subtracts spoilt votes but in some places includes blank ballots that were otherwise accepted.

Completed Ballots: This metric looks at ballots that were accepted &quot;and&quot; completed. This is the smallest numerator, but captures only those ballots that will impact the outcome of the election.

For the numerator, it is often assumed that the number of voters who went to the polls should equal the number of ballots cast, which in turn should equal the number of votes counted, but this is not the case. Not all voters who arrive at the polls necessarily cast ballots. Some may be turned away because they are ineligible, some may be turned away improperly, and some who sign the voting register may not actually cast ballots. Furthermore, voters who do cast ballots may abstain, deliberately voting for nobody, or they may spoil their votes, either accidentally or as an act of protest.

In the United Kingdom, the Electoral Commission distinguishes between &quot;valid vote turnout&quot;, which excludes spoilt ballots, and &quot;ballot box turnout&quot;, which does not.

In the United States, it has been common to report turnout as the sum of votes for the top race on the ballot, because not all jurisdictions report the actual number of people who went to the polls nor the number of undervotes or overvotes. Overvote rates of around 0.3 percent are typical of well-run elections, but in Gadsden County Florida, the overvote rate was 11 percent in November 2000.

===Denominator (out of people)===

==== Possible Metrics ====
&quot;From largest to smallest&quot;

Total population: everyone who lives in a place, regardless of age, citizenship status or other factors that affect voting eligibility. This has the advantage of being an accessible indicator of how close a place may be to universal suffrage.

Voting-age population: everyone above the legal voting age in a country regardless of citizenship status or other factors that might affect voting eligibility. This has the advantage of being easier to measure than &#x27;eligible voters.&#x27;

Eligible voters: This measures all the voters allowed to vote under current law, which in some places includes people who have not registered or re-registered to vote. This is more difficult to measure as more categories of people are disenfranchised and can include non-resident voters.

Registered voters: This measurement captures all who are registered to vote. This has the advantage of being easy to measure and readily accessible, though overlooks those who are unwilling or unable to register due to barriers such as a complex registration or re-registration process.

==== Examples ====
In the United States, for example, there is no accurate registry of exactly who is eligible to vote, since only about 70–75% of people choose to register themselves. Thus, turnout has to be calculated based on population estimates. Some political scientists have argued that these measures do not properly account for the large number of legal permanent residents (green card holders), undocumented immigrants, disenfranchised felons and persons who are considered &#x27;mentally incompetent&#x27; in the United States. Voter turnout everywhere would be higher if measured by eligibility and not voting-age population.

Even in countries with fewer restrictions on the franchise, voting age population turnout data can still be impacted by large numbers of non-citizen residents and non-resident citizens voting, often under-reporting turnout by as much as 10 percentage points. Professor Michael P. McDonald constructed an estimation of the turnout against the &#x27;voting eligible population&#x27; (VEP), instead of the &#x27;voting age population&#x27; (VAP). For the American presidential elections of 2004, turnout could then be expressed as 60.32% of voting eligible population, rather than 55.27% of voting age population.

In New Zealand, registration is supposed to be universal. This does not eliminate uncertainty in the eligible population because this system has been shown to be unreliable, with a large number of eligible but unregistered citizens creating inflated turnout figures.

===Looking for trends===

For some time, the Gallup Organization has utilized a metric of polls to determine who would vote. These polls would look at &quot;intention to vote, registration status, reported frequency of past voting, awareness of where to vote, interest in politics in general, interest in the particular election, and intensity of candidate preference.&quot;

Since around 1985, there appears to be a gradual decrease in voter turnout globally when looking at the voting-age population. However, a 2001 article in the American Political Science Review, Michael McDonald and Samuel Popkin argued, that at least in the United States, voter turnout since 1972 has not actually declined when calculated for those eligible to vote, what they term the voting-eligible population. In 1972, noncitizens and ineligible felons (depending on state law) constituted about 2% of the voting-age population. By 2004, ineligible voters constituted nearly 10%. Ineligible voters are not evenly distributed across the country – 20% of California&#x27;s voting-age population is ineligible to vote – which confounds comparisons of states. Furthermore, they argue that an examination of the Census Bureau&#x27;s Current Population Survey shows that turnout is low but not declining among the youth, when the high youth turnout of 1972 (the first year 18- to 20-year-olds were eligible to vote in most states) is removed from the trendline.

Other forms of political participation have declined, such as voluntary participation in political parties and the attendance of observers at town meetings. Meanwhile, church attendance, membership in professional, fraternal, and student societies, youth groups, and parent-teacher associations has also declined. Some argue that technological developments in society such as &quot;automobilization,&quot; suburban living, and &quot;an explosive proliferation of home entertainment devices&quot; have contributed to a loss of community, which in turn has weakened participation in civic life. At the same time, some forms of participation have increased. People have become far more likely to participate in boycotts, demonstrations, and to donate to political campaigns.

Many causes have been proposed for what some see as a decline in voter participation though all offered in this section are heavily disputed. When asked why they do not vote, many people report that they have too little free time. However, over the last several decades, studies have consistently shown that the amount of leisure time has not decreased, even if the perception of less leisure time results in less participation. While wages and employment decrease voter turnout in gubernatorial elections, they appear to not affect national races. Geographic mobility has increased over the last few decades, bringing barriers to voting in a district where one is a recent arrival, including knowing little about the local candidates and issues. It has been argued that democratic consolidation (the stabilization of new democracies) contributes to the decline in voter turnout. A 2017 study challenges this, however.

==Increasing voter turnout==
Various measures have been proposed to attempt to increase voter turnout. One of these is to make election days national holidays in order to give potential voters more time and freedom to vote. This has been implemented in multiple democracies of which have higher voter turnouts than the U.S., which does not make elections days national holidays.

Voter registration has been found to be a barrier to democratic participation. Therefore, another measure cited to boost election turnout is to have automatic voter registration, a measure that has been implemented in various democracies around the world. studies have shown that increased voter registration leads to greater turnout at elections.

Another proposed measure to increase voter turnout is a move to a proportional representation system for countries that currently use first-past-the-post in elections. Countries that use proportional representation systems have higher turnouts when compared to those that do not. The reasoning that has been given for this is that voters feel they &quot;are given a more meaningful choice at the ballot box&quot; and that a proportional electoral system leads to greater voter representation.

==Voter turnout by country==
Voter turnout varies considerably between nations. One dataset with voter turnouts by country and election is the Election turnout indicator in V-Dem Democracy indices. It tends to be lower in North America, Asia and Latin America than in most of Europe and Oceania. Based on all parliamentary elections between 1945 and 1997, Western Europe averages a 77% turnout, and South and Central America around 54%. The differences between nations tend to be greater than those between classes, ethnic groups, or regions within nations. Confusingly, some of the factors that cause internal differences do not seem to apply on a global level. For instance, nations with better-educated populaces do not have higher turnouts. 
There are two main commonly cited causes of these international differences: culture and institutions. However, there is much debate over the relative impact of the various factors.

Indonesia, which before 1998 always had a high percentage of voter (more than 87%) but then dip down to low 70% in the 2014, saw a record breaking voters in the 2019 Indonesian general election with more than 158 million people cast their ballots on the same day, and has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s most complex one-day elections&quot;.

Wealth and literacy have some effect on turnout, but are not reliable measures. Countries such as Angola and Ethiopia have long had high turnouts, but so have the wealthy states of Europe. The United Nations Human Development Index shows some correlation between higher standards of living and higher turnout. The age of a democracy is also an important factor. Elections require considerable involvement by the population, and it takes some time to develop the cultural habit of voting, and the associated understanding of and confidence in the electoral process. This factor may explain the lower turnouts in the newer democracies of Eastern Europe and Latin America. Much of the impetus to vote comes from a sense of civic duty, which takes time and certain social conditions that can take decades to develop:
*trust in government;
*degree of partisanship among the population;
*interest in politics, and
*belief in the political efficacy of voting.

Demographics also have an effect. Older people tend to vote more than youths, so societies where the average age is somewhat higher, such as Europe; have higher turnouts than somewhat younger countries such as the United States. Populations that are more mobile and those that have lower marriage rates tend to have lower turnout. In countries that are highly multicultural and multilingual, it can be difficult for national election campaigns to engage all sectors of the population.

The nature of elections also varies between nations. In the United States, negative campaigning and character attacks are more common than elsewhere, potentially suppressing turnouts. The focus placed on get out the vote efforts and mass-marketing can have important effects on turnout. Partisanship is an important impetus to turnout, with the highly partisan more likely to vote. Turnout tends to be higher in nations where political allegiance is closely linked to class, ethnic, linguistic, or religious loyalties. Countries where multiparty systems have developed also tend to have higher turnouts. Nations with a party specifically geared towards the working class will tend to have higher turnouts among that class than in countries where voters have only big tent parties, which try to appeal to all the voters, to choose from. A four-wave panel study conducted during the 2010 Swedish national election campaign showed clear differences in media use between age groups, and that political social media use and attention to political news in traditional media increase political engagement over time. Social media is not always used effectively and may sometimes have a negative impact on the results of the election. In the United States, Barack Obama utilized Facebook to his benefit during his first run for presidency and jumpstarted the use of social media in political campaigns. The utilization of social media, and perhaps the negative impacts that social media have on campaigns, were seen in the 2020 United States election.

=== United States ===

Rosenstone and Hansen contend that there is a decline in turnout in the United States and that it is the product of a change in campaigning strategies as a result of the so-called new media. Before the introduction of television, almost all of a party&#x27;s resources would be directed towards intensive local campaigning and get out the vote initiatives. In the modern era, these resources have been redirected to expensive media campaigns in which the potential voter is a passive participant. During the same period, negative campaigning has become ubiquitous in the United States and elsewhere and has been shown to impact voter turnout. Attack ads and smear campaigns give voters a negative impression of the entire political process. The evidence for this is mixed: elections involving highly unpopular incumbents generally have high turnout; some studies have found that mudslinging and character attacks reduce turnout, but that substantive attacks on a party&#x27;s record can increase it. To counter this, programs such as MTV&#x27;s &quot;Rock the Vote&quot; and the &quot;Vote or Die&quot; initiatives have been introduced to increase turnouts of those between the ages of 18 and 25. A number of governments and electoral commissions have also launched efforts to boost turnout. For instance, Elections Canada has launched mass media campaigns to encourage voting prior to elections, as have bodies in Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

Structural differences between democracies, including the complexity of the system and ease of voting are more often used to explain differences in turnout between nations, with United States voters in particular suffering from a complicated maze of federalism and separation of powers that is relatively unique among democracies. The Brennan Center for Justice reported that in 2016 fourteen states passed restrictive voting laws. Examples of these laws are photo ID mandates, narrow times for early voting, and limitations on voter registration. Barbour and Wright also believe that one of the causes is restrictive voting laws but they call this system of laws regulating the electorate. The Constitution gives states the power to make decisions regarding restrictive voting laws. In 2008 the Supreme Court made a crucial decision regarding Indiana&#x27;s voter ID law in saying that it does not violate the constitution. Since then almost half of the states have passed restrictive voting laws. These laws contribute to Barbour and Wrights idea of the rational nonvoter. This is someone who does not vote because the benefits of them not voting outweighs the cost to vote. These laws add to the &quot;cost&quot; of voting, or reason that make it more difficult and to vote.

Google extensively studied the causes behind low voter turnout in the United States, and argues that one of the key reasons behind lack of voter participation is the so-called &quot;interested bystander&quot;. According to Google&#x27;s study, 48.9% of adult Americans can be classified as &quot;interested bystanders&quot;, as they are politically informed but are reticent to involve themselves in the civic and political sphere. This category is not limited to any socioeconomic or demographic groups. Google theorizes that individuals in this category suffer from political apathy, as they are interested in political life but believe that their individual effect would be negligible. These individuals often participate politically on the local level, but shy away from national elections.

==Other discussed factors==

The chance of any one vote determining the outcome is low. Some studies show that a single vote in a voting scheme such as the Electoral College in the United States has an even lower chance of determining the outcome. Other studies claim that the Electoral College actually increases voting power. Studies using game theory, which takes into account the ability of voters to interact, have also found that the expected turnout for any large election should be zero.

The basic formula for determining whether someone will vote, on the questionable assumption that people act completely rationally, is

: formula_1

where
* &quot;P&quot; is the probability that an individual&#x27;s vote will affect the outcome of an election,
* &quot;B&quot; is the perceived benefit that would be received if that person&#x27;s favored political party or candidate were elected,
* &quot;D&quot; originally stood for democracy or civic duty, but today represents any social or personal gratification an individual gets from voting, and
* &quot;C&quot; is the time, effort, and financial cost involved in voting.

Since &quot;P&quot; is virtually zero in most elections, &quot;PB&quot; may be also near zero, and &quot;D&quot; is thus the most important element in motivating people to vote. For a person to vote, these factors must outweigh &quot;C&quot;. Experimental political science has found that even when &quot;P&quot; is likely greater than zero, this term has no effect on voter turnout. Enos and Fowler (2014) conducted a field experiment that exploits the rare opportunity of a tied election for major political office. Informing citizens that the special election to break the tie will be close (meaning a high &quot;P&quot; term) has little mobilizing effect on voter turnout.

Riker and Ordeshook developed the modern understanding of &quot;D&quot;. They listed five major forms of gratification that people receive for voting: complying with the social obligation to vote; affirming one&#x27;s allegiance to the political system; affirming a partisan preference (also known as expressive voting, or voting for a candidate to express support, not to achieve any outcome); affirming one&#x27;s importance to the political system; and, for those who find politics interesting and entertaining, researching and making a decision. Other political scientists have since added other motivators and questioned some of Riker and Ordeshook&#x27;s assumptions. All of these concepts are inherently imprecise, making it difficult to discover exactly why people choose to vote.

Recently, several scholars have considered the possibility that B includes not only a personal interest in the outcome, but also a concern for the welfare of others in the society (or at least other members of one&#x27;s favorite group or party). In particular, experiments in which subject altruism was measured using a dictator game showed that concern for the well-being of others is a major factor in predicting turnout and political participation. This motivation is distinct from D, because voters must think others benefit from the &quot;outcome&quot; of the election, not their &quot;act&quot; of voting in and of itself.

=== Habit ===
Turnout differences appear to persist over time; in fact, the strongest predictor of individual turnout is whether or not one voted in the previous election. As a result, many scholars think of turnout as habitual behavior that can be learned or unlearned, especially among young adults.

=== Childhood influences ===
Studies have found that improving children&#x27;s social skills and enrolling them in high-quality early-childhood educational programs increases their turnout as adults.

=== Demographics ===
Socioeconomic factors are significantly associated with whether individuals develop the habit of voting. The most important socioeconomic factor affecting voter turnout is education. The more educated a person is, the more likely they are to vote, even controlling for other factors that are closely associated with education level, such as income and class. Income has some effect independently: wealthier people are more likely to vote, regardless of their educational background. There is some debate over the effects of ethnicity, race, and gender. In the past, these factors unquestionably influenced turnout in many nations, but nowadays the consensus among political scientists is that these factors have little effect in Western democracies when education and income differences are taken into account. A 2018 study found that while education did not increase turnout on average, it did raise turnout among individuals from low socioeconomic status households. Public-sector employees have higher voter turnout than private-sector employees.

However, since different ethnic groups typically have different levels of education and income, there are important differences in turnout between such groups in many societies. Other demographic factors have an important influence: young people are far less likely to vote than the elderly. Occupation has little effect on turnout, with the notable exception of higher voting rates among government employees in many countries.

There can also be regional differences in voter turnout. One issue that arises in continent-spanning nations, such as Australia, Canada, the United States and Russia, is that of time zones. Canada banned the broadcasting of election results in any region where the polls have not yet closed; this ban was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada.

=== Differences between elections ===
Within countries there can be important differences in turnout between individual elections. Elections where control of the national executive is not at stake generally have much lower turnouts—often half that for general elections. Off-year municipal and provincial elections, and by-elections to fill casual vacancies, typically have lower turnouts, as do elections for the parliament of the supranational European Union, which is separate from the executive branch of the EU&#x27;s government. In the United States, midterm congressional elections attract far lower turnouts than Congressional elections held concurrently with Presidential ones. Runoff elections also tend to attract lower turnouts.

==== Competitiveness of races ====
In theory, one of the factors that is most likely to increase turnout is a close race. Following the Downsian Closeness hypothesis and the idea of instrumental voting, voters rationally estimate the costs and benefits of participating in an election. Benefits exceed the costs if a close outcome of the election is expected and voters believe their ballot may be decisive for the outcome. Additionally, in these elections parties increase their mobilization efforts. Although the logic of instrumental voting applies to all elections, the effects are more prominent in democracies and majoritarian electoral systems.

An example is the 2004 U.S. presidential election. With an intensely polarized electorate and all polls showing a close finish between President George W. Bush and Democratic challenger John F. Kerry, the turnout in the election was close to 60%, resulting in a record number of popular votes for both candidates (around 62 million for Bush and 59 million for Kerry). However, this race also demonstrates the influence that contentious social issues can have on voter turnout; for example, the voter turnout rate in 1860 wherein anti-slavery candidate Abraham Lincoln won the election was the second-highest on record (81.2 percent, second only to 1876, with 81.8 percent). Nonetheless, there is evidence to support the argument that predictable election results—where one vote is not seen to be able to make a difference—have resulted in lower turnouts, such as Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1996 re-election (which featured the lowest voter turnout in the United States since 1924), the United Kingdom general election of 2001, and the 2005 Spanish referendum on the European Constitution; all of these elections produced decisive results on a low turnout.

A 2020 NBER paper, examining evidence from Swiss referendums, found that an awareness by the electorate that an election would be close increased turnout. Controlling for canton and vote fixed effects, the study determined &quot;that greater cantonal newspaper coverage of close polls significantly increases voter turnout&quot;

=== Previous incarceration ===
One 2017 study in the &quot;Journal of Politics&quot; found that, in the United States, incarceration had no significant impact on turnout in elections: ex-felons did not become less likely to vote after their time in prison. Also in the United States, incarceration, probation, and a felony record deny 5–6 million Americans of the right to vote, with reforms gradually leading more states to allow people with felony criminal records to vote, while almost none allow incarcerated people to vote.

=== Costs of participation ===
A 2017 study in &quot;Electoral Studies&quot; found that Swiss cantons that reduced the costs of postal voting for voters by prepaying the postage on return envelopes (which otherwise cost 85 Swiss Franc cents) were &quot;associated with a statistically significant 1.8 percentage point increase in voter turnout&quot;. A 2016 study in the &quot;American Journal of Political Science&quot; found that preregistration – allowing young citizens to register before being eligible to vote – increased turnout by 2 to 8 percentage points. A 2019 study in &quot;Social Science Quarterly&quot; found that the introduction of a vote‐by‐mail system in Washington state led to an increase in turnout. Another 2019 study in &quot;Social Science Quarterly&quot; found that online voter registration increased voter turnout, in particular for young voters. A 2020 study in &quot;Political Behavior&quot; found that a single postcard by election officials to unregistered eligible voters boosted registration rates by a percentage point and turnout by 0.9 percentage points, with the strongest effects on young, first-time voters.

The availability of ballot drop boxes increases turnout.

A 2018 study in the &quot;British Journal of Political Science&quot; found that internet voting in local elections in Ontario, Canada, only had a modest impact on turnout, increasing turnout by 3.5 percentage points. The authors of the study say that the results &quot;suggest that internet voting is unlikely to solve the low turnout crisis, and imply that cost arguments do not fully account for recent turnout declines.&quot;

=== Knowledge and Voting advice applications===
A 2017 experimental study found that by sending registered voters between the ages of 18 and 30 a voter guide containing salient information about candidates in an upcoming election (a list of candidate endorsements and the candidates&#x27; policy positions on five issues in the campaign) increased turnout by 0.9 points. Voting advice applications have strong evidence to increase voter turnout and vote choice and moderate evidence to increase voting knowledge.

==== Voter pledges ====
A 2018 study found that &quot;young people who pledge to vote are more likely to turn out than those who are contacted using standard Get-Out-the-Vote materials. Overall, pledging to vote increased voter turnout by 3.7 points among all subjects and 5.6 points for people who had never voted before.&quot;

=== Weather and timing ===
Research results are mixed as to whether bad weather affects turnout. There is research that shows that precipitation can reduce turnout, though this effect is generally rather small, with most studies finding each millimeter of rainfall to reduce turnout by 0.015 to 0.1 percentage points. At least two studies, however, found no evidence that weather disruptions reduce turnout. A 2011 study found &quot;that while rain decreases turnout on average, it does not do so in competitive elections.&quot; Some research has also investigated the effect of temperature on turnout, with some finding increased temperatures to moderately increase turnout. Some other studies, however, found temperature to have no significant impact on turnout. These variations in turnout can also have partisan impacts; a 2017 study in the journal &quot;American Politics Research&quot; found that rainfall increased Republican vote shares, because it decreased turnout more among Democratic voters than Republican voters. Studies from the Netherlands and Germany have also found weather-related turnout decreases to benefit the right, while a Spanish study found a reverse relationship.

The season and the day of the week (although many nations hold all their elections on the same weekday) can also affect turnout. Weekend and summer elections find more of the population on holiday or uninterested in politics, and have lower turnouts. When nations set fixed election dates, these are usually midweek during the spring or autumn to maximize turnout. Variations in turnout between elections tend to be insignificant. It is extremely rare for factors such as competitiveness, weather, and time of year to cause an increase or decrease in turnout of more than five percentage points, far smaller than the differences between groups within society, and far smaller than turnout differentials between nations.

=== Household socialization ===
A 2018 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; found that the parents to newly enfranchised voters &quot;become 2.8 percentage points more likely to vote.&quot; A 2018 study in the journal &quot;Political Behavior&quot; found that increasing the size of households increases a household member&#x27;s propensity to vote.

A 2018 PlosOne study found that a &quot;partisan who is married to a co-partisan is more likely to vote. This phenomenon is especially pronounced for partisans in closed primaries, elections in which non-partisan registered spouses are ineligible to participate.&quot;

=== Ballot secrecy ===
According to a 2018 study, get-out-the-vote groups in the United States who emphasize ballot secrecy along with reminders to vote increase turnout by about 1 percentage point among recently registered nonvoters.

===Reasons for not voting===

There are philosophical, moral, and practical reasons that some people cite for not voting in electoral politics, typically owing to obstacles to voting, though some of the practical reasons for abstention have more to do with rare, difficult to predict situations arising from flaws in the design of the voting system that fail to efficiently capture voter preferences.
