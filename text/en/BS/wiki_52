<text>Degrassi Junior High is a Canadian teen drama television series created by Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood. It is the second entry of the &quot;Degrassi&quot; television franchise after &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot; and aired on the CBC from 18 January 1987 to 27 February 1989, and on PBS in the United States starting from September 1987. The series follows those who attend the titular fictional school and the issues they face.

Produced by Schuyler and Hood&#x27;s Playing With Time, development of the series began soon after the end of &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot;, in response to a perceived lack of teenage representation in media. Its cast mainly consisted of amateurs who were similar in age to the characters they played, a deliberate response to the trend of young adults being cast in teenage roles. The actors had extensive input in the writing process, and plots were often drawn from their real lives. It was filmed entirely on-location in Toronto, with then Daisy Avenue Public School in Etobicoke used as the school.

The series received widespread critical acclaim on release, with praise directed at its realism, cinematography, and portrayal of serious topics, but became a significant commercial success in Canada after it was moved to a prime-time spot, while it also developed cult followings in the United States and Australia. In its home country, it won eight Gemini Awards, including four in a single year. A sequel series, &quot;Degrassi High&quot; (1989–1991), continued to follow its characters into high school, and the franchise&#x27;s revival and continuation with &quot;&quot; (2001–2015) was brought into motion by a successful 1999 televised cast reunion.

In spite of seldom mainstream acknowledgement, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; is credited with being the progenitor of the teen drama and a major influence on series such as &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, and continues to be highly regarded. In 2017, the Toronto International Film Festival named it one of Canada&#x27;s most significant contributions to the cinematic landscape.

== Premise ==
&quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; follows those who attend the titular fictional school, located in an unnamed North American town. The series deals with a wide range of subjects through its characters, including serious issues such as teenage pregnancy, abuse, bullying, racism, interracial dating, drugs, alcoholism, drunk driving, and eating disorders, as well as more mundane coming-of-age experiences, such as relationships, exams, and puberty.

Schuyler stated the series had a &quot;double mandate to entertain and educate&quot;, and each episode was intended as a conversation starter. The series is set entirely from a teenage perspective. Additionally, adults have a small role in the series, usually never being present in a scene without a teenage character present, and the characters are portrayed navigating their own problems and making their own decisions, for better or for worse, with minimal adult intervention: &quot;We&#x27;re not looking for &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;.&quot;

The first two seasons encompass a full year, with some characters in Grade 7 and some in Grade 8, while season three takes place the following year, in which Grade 9, typically the start of high school in North America, is appended to the junior high school, which was in reality a creative decision to retain the entire cast. In season three, the grade 9 students attend a nearby high school, Borden High, part-time. In the final episode, a faulty boiler causes a fire that destroys the school building forces the characters to evacuate from their graduation dance.

The series is not a sequel to &quot;The Kids Of Degrassi Street,&quot; despite sharing some of the actors from that series&quot;.&quot;

==Cast==
=== Repertory company ===
&quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; did not have a fixed cast. In his book &quot;TV North&quot;, Peter Kenter writes that no official cast listing appears to exist. The series consisted of members of Playing With Time&#x27;s repertory company, which originally comprised fifty-four kids, and later sixty-five in total. According to Kathryn Ellis, the unique casting system of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; was so that every member of the repertory company had &quot;equal status&quot;, although some characters were more prominent than others. Unlike the trend of casting young adults to play teenagers, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; cast real age-appropriate actors who largely lacked acting experience. Because of its non-union status, none of the actors were members of unions. Crew members occasionally made background appearances, including art director Judy Shiner, picture editor Rob de Lint, and publicist Kathryn Ellis. Writer Susin Nielsen had a brief role in two episodes as a janitor.

== Development ==

=== Concept ===
In 1976, Ontario schoolteacher Linda Schuyler, an aspiring filmmaker, and her partner Kit Hood, an editor, founded the company Playing With Time to produce educational films and documentaries. In 1979, they produced the short film, &quot;Ida Makes a Movie,&quot; based on the 1974 children&#x27;s book by Kay Chorao, which aired on the CBC. The success of &quot;Ida Makes A Movie&quot; led to an annual string of short films that further explored the same continuity. These short films were the basis for the children&#x27;s series &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street.&quot; The series was a critical success on the CBC and won numerous accolades; the episode &quot;Griff Makes A Date&quot; won International Emmy Award in 1985. The production team also featured editor Yan Moore, who became the head writer of the next series, as well as the co-creator of &quot;&quot;.

In January 1984, Linda Schuyler told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that they were &quot;planning another series, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, and we&#x27;re starting with the idea of doing 26 episodes. There&#x27;s no such school, but who cares? We&#x27;re negotiating seriously with CBC.&quot; In November 1985, she again told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; that they would &quot;launch a new series in about one year – Degrassi Junior High. The very last segment [of the series] shows the kids graduating. Where are they going? Degrassi Junior High!&quot;. The show was not a direct sequel, but instead a spinoff of the previous series. To help with the development, Schuyler hired a young writer named Avrum Jacobson. Schuyler explained to Jacobson that she was looking for a school version of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, of which she &quot;loved the intertwined storylines, some of which were resolved at the end of an episode and others which carried on to the next. I loved the moral dilemmas characters faced, often pitting &#x27;what’s right&#x27; against &#x27;what works&#x27;&quot;. Development of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; commenced in early 1986.

=== Casting ===
&quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; is noted for casting actors similar in age to their characters, as opposed to the practice of casting young adults in teenage roles commonly observed in media. Brodie Lancaster of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; stated that this was a &quot;rare occurrence in the genre&quot; of teen drama. Schuyler has spoken of the inauthenticity of this practice on multiple occasions; during &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;&#x27;s development in 1986, she told the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; about how &quot;so much of the American stuff set in high schools is played by late teens and early 20s – and then some&quot;. In 2016, she further elaborated to &quot;IndieWire&quot;: &quot;I like to talk about the fact that you can take a 25-year-old who looks 15 and have them play a role, but that actor is bringing 10 more years of life experience to that role. By having our cast be age-appropriate, they bring the freshness and the authenticity of that age.&quot;

During the development stage, Schuyler and Hood held a &quot;pow-wow&quot; with the cast of &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot; at the Playing With Time offices and offered them a choice between retaining their original characters, or auditioning for new characters. According to Kit Hood, the kids &quot;wanted to leave behind the baggage, personalities and families of where they&#x27;d been&quot; and decided to play new characters instead. Many of the actors who were regulars on &quot;Degrassi Street&quot; at this time, including Anais Granofsky, Neil Hope, and Stacie Mistysyn, returned in new roles.

Auditions took place throughout schools in Toronto; an estimated 300 kids auditioned and fifty-four were selected. Pat Mastroianni, who played Joey Jeremiah, was the first to audition. These actors constituted the Playing With Time Repertory Company (referred to by Kathryn Ellis as &quot;the Repco&quot;). The actors underwent a three-week acting workshop from 26 May to 13 June 1986, which taught them basic acting techniques. These workshops were repeated annually before the filming of each season, as new actors joined, and established actors took advanced workshops. Characters would be developed based on the strengths of the actors, and those who did exceptionally well would have their roles expanded upon. The idea of the repertory company meant that there was no bias towards a particular set of actors on screen; major characters could be background extras in one episode, as minor characters could get a major role or focus, a practice rare in television. The actors would also earn school credits for being in the repertory company. The actors were required to avoid missing more than eight days of their real school, but those with prominent roles usually missed three to four days a week. A tutor was used on set to help the actors with their studies. On set, the teenage actors would also usually run errands, including washing dishes and moving sandbags.

=== Production and filming ===
Following the first read-through of the script, which would take place in a circle, Schuyler and Hood sought extensive input from the actors. Many of the show&#x27;s ideas were drawn from the actor&#x27;s personal experiences, the writers&#x27; own teenage experiences, and &quot;official idea sessions&quot; with the actors. Yan Moore recalled in 2005: &quot;In the old days, the kids would come to the office...and they&#x27;d tell us things.&quot; For instance, actor Siluck Saysanasy, who played Yick Yu, was forbidden to get an earring by his father, but was only allowed if he got one for the show; writer Yan Moore would write an earring into the script for Saysanasy. Amanda Stepto often experienced unwanted attention for her spiked hair, which was incorporated into an episode of the series. A typical episode would take two weeks to rehearse and two weeks to film. Each episode cost approximately $250,000 to $350,000 to produce; the first season cost $2.6 million.Filming for the show began on 8 July 1986 in Etobicoke, Ontario. and finished in December 1988. The actors would routinely gather at the Playing With Time production office and be taken via a minivan to the set, where shooting would take place from 9:00a.m to 6:30p.m. The school used for the show was the Vincent Massey Public School (then known as Daisy Avenue Public School) in Etobicoke, Ontario. At the time, the ground floor was being used as a Seventh-day Adventist school. As a result, the majority of the series was shot on the second floor, with the ground floor only used occasionally. One of the rooms, which was used as a library, served as a green room. The principal&#x27;s office, in which kids are seen entering and leaving, was actually a door that opened to a blank wall. The lockers in the school were arranged to create an &quot;illusion&quot; of corridors. Principal photography of the series usually took place from April to December.

The series was filmed entirely on-location throughout the Greater Toronto Area. Places seen on the series include Queen-Broadview Village, which contained the real De Grassi Street as well as a building similar to that of Vincent Massey&#x27;s, Dundas Street Junior School, which coincidentally served as the location for the school in &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot;, that served as a background double; this was done to make it seem like that neighbourhood was near the school, when in reality it was not. Various real life stores and other locations are shown and mentioned in the series, such as the Shoppers Drug Mart location on the corner of Queen &amp; Carlaw streets, where various characters are seen shopping. Other locations, such as the Degrassi Grocery and the Broadview Community Health Clinic featured in the episode &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot; no longer exist. Earl Grey Senior Public School in Toronto, where Linda Schuyler was a teacher, served as the setting for Borden High School, where the grade nine students of season 3 attend part-time. The writers deliberately avoided real-world pop culture references in an effort to avoid dating the show, and instead created fictional media as a substitute. This includes bands such as &quot;Gourmet Scum&quot;, movies such as &quot;Teen Academy IV&quot; and &quot;Swamp Sex Robots&quot;, game shows such as &quot;Quest for the Best&quot;, and soap operas such as &quot;Days Of Passion&quot;. Sex educator Sue Johanson played &quot;Dr. Sally&quot;, who hosts a radio talk show similar to Johanson&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Sex Show&quot;.

=== Makeup and wardrobe ===
In an unconventional practice for television, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; did not have a makeup and wardrobe department. The cast would usually wear their own clothes and apply their own makeup, although the art department would tweak their appearances for continuity purposes. Neil Hope, who played Derek &quot;Wheels&quot; Wheeler, stated: &quot;It&#x27;s looking phony. [...] When you look more natural, its helping the show.&quot; Some of the clothing choices however were not of the actors; actress Nicole Stoffman did not dress like her sexually provocative character Stephanie Kaye. However, the &quot;outrageously-coiffed&quot; hair of character Christine &quot;Spike&quot; Nelson, was the real hair of actress Amanda Stepto, who was an avid fan of punk rock music.

=== Opening sequence ===
The &quot;documentary-style&quot; opening sequence follows the show&#x27;s 30–60-second cold open. The sequence begins with a stop-motion live-action scene of a person picking up a group of textbooks, labeled &quot;History&quot;, &quot;Geography&quot;, &quot;Math&quot; and &quot;English&quot;, and walking away. It mostly consists of scenes from various episodes of the characters in and around the school, juxtaposed with images of students with blackboard-esque transitions. The opening sequence does not credit the cast members. Kelley criticised this: &quot;The opening needs to be a little cheat sheet to all of them. Give us a little clue to their personality. Here we’ve just got some random smiling and a set of twins that are ALWAYS in the same shot together.&quot;

=== Theme song and music ===

Wendy Watson and Lewis Manne, composers of the music to &quot;The Kids Of Degrassi Street&quot;, composed, arranged and performed all of the original music for &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, including its theme song, which was sung by Watson. The theme is composed in C major and is driven by synthesizers and guitars. It begins with a pessimistic tone, with the narrator feeling uncertain about going to school. The lyrics turn optimistic as the narrator notices &quot;that someone is smiling right at me&quot;. It concludes with the lyrics &quot;Everybody can succeed, all you need is to believe/Be honest with yourself, forget your fears and doubts/Come on give us a try at Degrassi Junior High!&quot;.

Anne Weiss of Cinema Canada magazine described the theme song as having a &quot;chirpy, almost inane melody&quot;. Shamus Kelley of Den of Geek called it &quot;inspirational&quot;, opining: &quot;It’s where the song shifts from talking about what’s going to happen at Degrassi and focuses on &quot;you&quot;. Come on, you can do it. This show will give you all the tools you need. Come on; sit down with us for half an hour so we can show you why getting pregnant in middle school is a SUPER drag. For a show that’s all about slice of life and dealing with big problems, it’s perfect.&quot; An instrumental variation of the opening theme is used in the end credits, and it was later reworked for &quot;Degrassi High&quot;. Watson and Manne recorded the show&#x27;s incidental and diegetic music using a drums, bass, guitar and keyboard arrangement. Songs by various Canadian recording artists, including Watson and Manne&#x27;s own music, were used in the background of school dances and on radios.

A frequent plot point in the series concerns the Zit Remedy, a fictional garage rock band comprising Joey Jeremiah on keyboards, Archie &quot;Snake&quot; Simpson on guitar, and Derek &quot;Wheels&quot; Wheeler on bass. Their respective actors, Pat Mastroianni, Stefan Brogren and Neil Hope, were musically inexperienced and were guided by Lewis Manne on how to play their instruments. They only have one song, titled &quot;Everybody Wants Something&quot;. According to Kathryn Ellis, the song was written by a nephew of Watson and Manne on the back of a school permission letter, and sent to them. However, Mastroianni has claimed that he, Brogren, and Hope wrote the song. In the novel &quot;Exit Stage Left&quot;, the Zit Remedy have a second song, titled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want To Be A Porcupine With Anyone Else But You, Baby&quot;. Stories around the group continue in &quot;Degrassi High&quot;, where their name is shortened to The Zits.

=== &quot;Degrassi Between Takes&quot; ===
Degrassi Between Takes is a half-hour documentary special that aired on 30 October 1989, a week before the premiere of the sequel series &quot;Degrassi High&quot;, on CBC. The documentary is a behind-the-scenes look at &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, shot during the show&#x27;s third season and narrated by Peter Gzowski. The special focuses on the development and impact of the series, with footage of the cast at the Gemini Awards, working on set, socializing in public and on publicity tours.

== Release ==
=== Original broadcast run ===
The series premiered on CBC on 18 January 1987 and concluded after three seasons and 42 episodes on 27 February 1989. It originally ran on Sundays at 5:00p.m. Starting from its second season, due to a budget squeeze, it was then moved to Monday nights at 7:30p.m, and then later by then-new CBC programming chief Ivan Fecan, a supporter of the show, to primetime at 8:30p.m, between the popular American series &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot; and &quot;Newhart&quot;. Fecan viewed &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; as a standard for Canadian television writers; in 1988, he stated that there was &quot;nothing bogus about that show&quot;, and that he wished that he had &quot;20 more shows like it&quot;. When Fecan called Schuyler to inform her of the move, she reportedly disagreed, feeling that the series wasn&#x27;t ready for prime time. She eventually agreed to the decision, under the condition that if the move was unsuccessful, the series wouldn&#x27;t be cancelled and instead be moved back to its original timeslot. Following its move to prime time, the viewership increased 40 percent.

In the United States, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) debuted the series on 26 September 1987. On PBS, the show aired on Saturdays at 7:00p.m. In New York City, the series aired on Tuesdays at 6:00p.m. on WNET starting from 22 September 1987. On PBS, the first two seasons were combined into one 26-episode season. The third season, which was aired as the second season in the United States, premiered on 10 December 1988 and ended on 15 April 1989. The program was distributed through PBS member station WGBH-TV in Boston, who was a primary financial backer of the show. Due to PBS&#x27;s lack of commercials, the American version featured more scenes than the original Canadian version.

By November 1988, Degrassi Junior High was being shown in over forty countries, including Australia, Greece, China, France, and the United Kingdom, where it was screened on the BBC starting from 5 April 1988. In the UK, several episodes were not broadcast in their regular timeslot, including &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot; and &quot;Rumour Has It&quot;, which involved rumours that a teacher was gay. Although these episodes were later included on the youth program DEF II on BBC2, the second and third seasons were never broadcast. The series concluded its BBC run on 10 May 1988, with re-runs of the aired episodes from the first season continuing into 1989. In Australia, the show debuted on ABC TV on 8 February 1988, as part of &quot;The Afternoon Show&quot; hosted by James Valentine, where it aired at 5:00p.m. The series finale aired in Australia on 10 October 1989.

In France, &quot;Junior High&quot; and &quot;High&quot; were aired under the banner &quot;Les Années collège&quot; (The College Years) on Antenne 2 starting from 10 September 1988.

=== Re-runs and syndication ===
In Canada, the series re-ran on CBC starting from summer 1991. On 1 September 1997, the show began to air in re-runs on Showcase. In the United States, the series was rerun on Showtime starting from 14 August 1994, in its original 1987 CBC timeslot. Starting from 8 October 2005, it debuted on the Noggin block The N with a two-hour block, followed by standard re-runs. In Australia, re-runs aired starting on ABC from 1992. It later re-ran on ABC1&#x27;s Rollercoaster and ABC2. By 2001, it had been syndicated in over seventy countries. In the United Kingdom, UK Gold screened &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; daily starting from its launch in 1992. Later in the mid-1990s, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; later reran on The Children&#x27;s Channel.

=== Novel adaptations ===

Starting from 1988, a series of mass-market paperback novelizations were released by James Lorimer &amp; Co. The books would often centre on a particular character on the show and expanded upon storylines from the series, although the novel &quot;Exit Stage Left,&quot; which centres around various students as they organize a school play, is original. A thirteenth book, based on the characters Arthur Kobalewscuy and Yick Yu and written by Kathryn Ellis, remains unreleased.

The books were also published in other places; in Australia, they were published by ABC in November 1990, with more published in January 1991. The books also saw French Canadian releases by Les Éditions de Minuit.

=== Home media and streaming ===
The series has seen multiple home video releases as well as releases to streaming. In the United States, the series is distributed on home video by WGBH Boston Home Video, who released a twenty-one volume VHS boxset in 2000. WGBH would later release it on DVD in Region 1 in 2005. Each season was released separately followed by a complete 9-disc boxset. The 2005 WGBH box set, as well as the individual sets, include various special features, including the &quot;Degrassi Talks&quot; series, the 1989 &quot;Degrassi Between Takes&quot; documentary, printable materials, wallpapers, and a pop quiz.

In Region 4, the show&#x27;s home media releases are distributed by Beyond Home Entertainment (under the imprint Force), who released a seven-disc set in 2006, including an extra disc containing special features. The special features are similar to the Region 1 box set, omitting the pop quiz. The series was also made available on YouTube.

In July 2023, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; was made available on Amazon Prime Video in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
== Reception and impact ==

=== Contemporary critical reception ===

&quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; was immediately acclaimed by most critics upon release. Favourable reviews regularly came from the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot;, the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, and the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;. After its move to prime time, critics felt it had been well deserved. Initially, one dissenting critic was Jim Bawden of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. A fan of &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot;, Bawden was largely negative in his review of the premiere episode, stating that it didn&#x27;t &quot;seem as naturalistic&quot; as &quot;The Kids of&quot; &quot;Degrassi Street&quot;, criticising the &quot;cutesy sitcom lines&quot; and calling the plotline of the episode &quot;forced and unreal&quot;. In later reviews, Bawden changed his assessment, and his later support for it was credited with influencing its move to prime-time.

Critics commonly viewed it as a superior alternative to other television programs, particularly American shows, that were more heavy-handed and moralistic in their portrayals of adolescent issues. Robert James of the &quot;Times Colonist&quot; stated: &quot;Unlike the wholesome role models that populate most TV series in the increasingly conservative &#x27;80s, these teenagers often learn from their own mistakes.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, Bob Remington felt &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; was an exception to &quot;unrealistically antiseptic&quot; television series such as &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Our House&quot;. Dave Rhein, in a review for wire service Gannett, declared it to be a &quot;diamond in the rough, that puts to shame commercial network efforts to create a show aimed at teenagers&quot;.

Praise was also given to the show&#x27;s technical aspects; Anne Weiss of &quot;Cinema Canada&quot; magazine noted that &quot;the style is untheatrical, non-demonstrative, giving the illusion that the young actors are simply acting out their lives&quot;. Other critics, including Weiss, and Janice Kennedy of the &quot;Montreal Gazette,&quot; praised the show&#x27;s cinematography. Kennedy praised the decision to shoot on film rather than video tape, stating that it gave it &quot;a smoother, more finished look&quot;. Weiss praised the show&#x27;s &quot;active use of the camera&quot;, which she felt &quot;breathes life into otherwise ordinary situations&quot;. Kennedy praised the dialogue and called it another strong suit of the show.

Although more of a low-key affair in the United States, reception from American critics was similarly positive. Speaking of the show&#x27;s upcoming premiere on PBS, Fred M. Hechinger of the &quot;New York Times&quot; pondered whether the show&#x27;s then-uncommon way of addressing adolescent issues would have an impact; &quot;Can teen-agers be won over to entertainment that is not mindless, violent or sexually irresponsible?&quot;. In 1989, the series was profiled by John Fisher Burns, also of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, who asserted it was &quot;remolding the pat-a-cake image of what the industry, with at least some sense of paradox, likes to call &quot;children&#x27;s television.&#x27;&quot; Writing for New Jersey&#x27;s &quot;The Record&quot;, Joel Pitsezner remarked that he was so impressed with the series that he skipped two press conferences to watch more episodes, citing in particular the &quot;intelligent and sensitive writing&quot; of Yan Moore, the &quot;believable interplay&quot; between the actors, and in particular the portrayal of the &quot;pain and awkwardness of the early teen years&quot;, the latter of which he believed to be its best quality. Steve Sonsky of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; praised the portrayal of its characters, and felt that it differentiated the series from others with teenage characters that were less realistically problematic.

=== Television ratings ===
By 1988, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; was the highest-rated drama show in Canada. It frequently exceeded a million viewers per week; in her memoir, Schuyler stated that at the time, &quot;a show in Canada (population of 27 million) was considered very successful if it broke through the one million mark&quot;. By season 2, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; was receiving an average of 1.4 million viewers with a peak of 1.9 million. At the end of season 2 in April 1988, &quot;Toronto Star&quot;&#x27;s Jim Bawden reported that its viewership &quot;hovered around 1.2 million a week, one of the brightest spots on Canadian TV&quot;. The season 3 premiere drew 1.7 million viewers, which accounted for 21 percent of the entire audience during that slot.

In the United Kingdom, where several episodes drew controversy and weren&#x27;t aired in its regular slot, the series amassed six million viewers, making it the highest-rated children&#x27;s program at the time.

=== Promotion and fan reaction ===
In Canada, the series became a cultural phenomenon, and turned its cast members into national celebrities, who drew a fanaticism likened to Beatlemania. They made numerous publicity trips around North America and in Europe to promote the show. They were accompanied by publicist Kathryn Ellis. When travelling by plane, one of the actors would be in charge of checking the others through the airport. They were warmly received in other places and participated in cultural activities. According to Ellis, the cast members frequently visited Halifax. Cast members also participated in local public service events; for instance, Bill Parrott, who played Shane McKay, co-hosted the launch of the Kids Help Phone hotline in Toronto. They also participated in meet-and-greets and book signings.

Some actors from the series were frequently conflated with their characters. Amanda Stepto, who played teenage mother Spike, was often sent baby products by fans who genuinely believed that she was pregnant. Kit Hood stated in &quot;Degrassi Between Takes&quot; of his concern that &quot;the audience sometimes expects the kids to have knowledge about their characters that they don&#x27;t have in real life&quot;. Despite their international fame, many of the actors&#x27; teachers and parents were not perturbed by this. Pat Mastroianni recalled that his geography teacher gave him a low grade despite succeeding in other subjects; Rebecca Haines recalled her parents threatening to remove her from the show if her grades were low enough. Speaking to the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, Haines stated: &quot;Some teachers can be jerks about it. [...] When you get home at eight at night, after working all day, you don&#x27;t feel like writing an essay&quot;.

In 1989, UNICEF Canada entered a partnership with &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, and the entire cast were made UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors. The cast members would make various appearances and appear in several public service announcements. Pat Mastroianni and Amanda Stepto flew to New York City to tour the Headquarters of the United Nations and meet other ambassadors. That same year, coinciding with the declaration of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a ten-minute video called &quot;The Degrassi Kids Rap On Rights&quot; was distributed to schools nationwide. The video, narrated by Amanda Stepto, focused on the impending ratification of the Convention and highlighted the childhood experiences of several cast members in refugee camps and natural disasters.

=== Use in schools ===
The series was often shown in schools as part of health and sex education curricula. Educational materials relating to the series were released by WGBH in the United States during its original run, including discussion &amp; activity guides. 25,000 copies of the &quot;Degrassi Junior High Discussion and Activity Guide&quot; were distributed to educators. In 1989, ten schools in Omaha, Nebraska were reported as using the first season of the series in their seventh and eighth grade human growth and development curriculum.

== Awards and nominations ==

&quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; won thirty-seven awards, including eight Gemini Awards, three Parents&#x27; Choice Awards, three Chris Awards, and one International Emmy Award. The episode &quot;It&#x27;s Late&quot; won the International Emmy Award for Children &amp; Young People in 1987, and the series was nominated again for the award in 1988 for the second season episode &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. The series won a Rockie Award for Best Continuing Series at the Banff Television Festival in 1988, where it drew praise from MTM Enterprises senior vice president and judge Laurence Bloustein, and marked the first time it had won an award outside of children&#x27;s categories. However, at the next festival, an episode about AIDS was unanimously rejected for being &quot;sloppily executed&quot;.

Out of the eight Gemini Awards won by the series, including one won in 1987 for Best Children&#x27;s Series, it won four in 1988, including Best Continuing Dramatic Series, and Best Direction in a Dramatic Comedy Series for Kit Hood. When one award was announced, thirty four cast members took the stage. Furthermore, actors Pat Mastroianni and Stacie Mistysyn won the Best Leading Actor and Best Leading Actress in a Dramatic Role awards in 1988 and 1989 respectively. Mastroianni&#x27;s win in particular was considered an upset, as he had beaten several established Canadian actors such as Scott Hylands and Donnelly Rhodes. Nineteen members of the cast, including Mastroianni, Mistysyn, Amanda Stepto, Stefan Brogren and Neil Hope were nominated for the Young Artist Award for Outstanding Young Ensemble Cast in 1990, but lost to &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Courage: The Mary Thomas Story.&quot;

== Legacy and influence ==
=== Retrospective assessments ===
&quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; is regarded as one of Canada&#x27;s greatest television achievements. In 2017, the series was named by the Toronto International Film Festival as one of Canada&#x27;s 150 most significant contributions to the cinematic landscape. The series is also credited with establishing the overall popularity and longevity of the &quot;Degrassi&quot; franchise. The series has continued to receive critical acclaim. Ian Warden of &quot;The Canberra Times&quot;, speaking of its continued re-runs on the ABC in Australia, asserted in 1995 that it was &quot;perhaps the best sustained piece of children&#x27;s television drama ever made&quot;. In 2000, Leah McLaren of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; recalled having disliked the series with her friends as a teenager, before later appreciating the &quot;raw beauty&quot; of the series as an adult. In addition, McLaren called it &quot;way ahead of its time, both aesthetically and conceptually&quot;. &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; critic Tony Atherton, in a mixed review of the premiere episode of &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation,&quot; made numerous comparisons between the characters of the older and newer series, and felt that due to the &quot;deluge of teen dramas since&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; would not make the same impact as the &quot;groundbreaking&quot; original series.

Reviewing the DVD release of its first season in 2007, Andrew Mickel of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; felt the show still held up twenty years after its debut, and stated that its &quot;real strength&quot; is that &quot;it is massively unfair, and the moral lessons aren’t hammered into each episode with a patronising mallet&quot;. He further elaborated that even though &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot; &quot;still tries to do the hard-hitting stuff&quot;, he felt &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; was &quot;much more of a labour of love&quot; because of the lengths the production crew went to produce it the first time around. &quot;Exclaim!&quot;&#x27;s Noel Dix, also reviewing the DVD release, remarked: &quot;Even to this day most shows geared towards teenagers would rather deal with absurd and unrealistic scenarios for sensationalistic results than deal with problems their viewers may experience&quot;, and that &quot;instead of it feeling like a stuffy educational show, &quot;Degrassi&quot; felt warm because its characters were real, awkward and somewhat unattractive, just like real high school!&quot; In 2016, David Berry of the &quot;National Post&quot; noted the difference between the show and the &quot;slicker&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot;, saying that it was &quot;like someone snuck a piece of avant-garde socialist realism onto mainstream network airwaves&quot;. In 2023, Denis Grignon of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; wrote that having rewatched the series, he &quot;expected a pleasant, but outdated, TV time capsule, and was pleasantly surprised that it was easy to look past the mullets, hairspray and phones fixed to kitchen walls to observe themes I now witness as an occasional high school supply teacher.&quot;

=== Influence on the teen drama genre ===
One of the first drama series in Canada to exclusively target teenage audiences, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; has been described as an early teen drama and an influence on later and better-known series such as &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210,&quot; of which &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; is frequently compared to. Michelle Byers, editor of &quot;Growing Up Degrassi&quot;, writes that while generally unacknowledged in most discussions about teen drama, &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; was a progenitor of the genre. According to the book &quot;The Greatest Cult Television Shows of All Time,&quot; the series was a trailblazer for future teen-oriented drama series &quot;mainly because it understood teenage culture better than almost any other show produced before or since&quot;.

A popular urban legend, which reportedly originated on the 1999 &quot;Jonovision&quot; cast reunion special, states that American producer Aaron Spelling unsuccessfully tried to adapt the series for an American audience, which led to the development of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210.&quot; Both Linda Schuyler and Kit Hood have denied this. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Sarah Hughes suggested that &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; was &quot;Spelling&#x27;s answer&quot; to &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;. Writing about the death of actor Neil Hope, the &quot;New York Times&quot;″s Paul Vitello said the show anticipated &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot; as well as the MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Real World&quot;. It has also been named as an influence on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, and &quot;Felicity&quot;. There have academic studies on the comparisons between &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and American teen drama series.

=== In popular culture ===
American filmmaker Kevin Smith was a particular fan of &quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot;, having discovered it while working at a convenience store in New Jersey, and acknowledged an infatuation with Stacie Mistysyn and her character Caitlin Ryan. Smith wrote a piece about his enthusiasm for the series for Details magazine in November 1996, where it is claimed that he spent $3,000 on the series on home video. Smith has referenced the series several times in his work, including &quot;Clerks&quot;, which features a character named Caitlin Bree, and &quot;Chasing Amy&quot;.

He wanted Mistysyn to appear in &quot;Mallrats&quot;, but Universal Pictures wanted a better-known actress and vetoed him. As a compromise, Shannen Doherty, who was cast in the role Smith wanted for Mistysyn, is seen wearing a &quot;Degrassi&quot; jacket in the film. Smith, along with Jason Mewes, guest-starred on and wrote several episodes of &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation,&quot; in which they play fictional versions of themselves filming a Jay and Silent Bob movie at the school. Smith later wrote the introduction to &quot;The Official 411: Degrassi Generations&quot; by Kathryn Ellis.

=== Cult following ===
&quot;Degrassi Junior High&quot; and &quot;Degrassi High&quot; developed a significant cult following after their initial broadcast. The 1990s saw the proliferation of an online fandom, which took form on a network of fanmade websites. One of these sites, &quot;Degrassi Online&quot;, maintained by University of Waterloo student Mark Aaron Polger, was particularly comprehensive, hosting multimedia and a collection of user-submitted fanfiction. Epitome Pictures, who were now handling the &quot;Degrassi&quot; series, sent Polger a draft statement of claim in December 2000, claiming he was confusing the public with his website. After he sent a press release to several media outlets and garnered the support of other fans, Epitome withdrew the claim. Polger criticised Epitome Pictures for showing a lack of gratitude for the online community&#x27;s impact on the show&#x27;s continued success. In 1996, Sharon Mulholland created the website &quot;Degrassi Update&quot;, which listed public sightings of cast members from the show.

On 24 August 1999, several fans hosted a small reunion event at the Centennial College where &quot;Degrassi High&quot; was filmed, and the cast reunited on the CBC youth show &quot;Jonovision&quot;, hosted by Jonathan Torrens, on 24–25 December 1999. With people from as far as San Francisco attending the taping, it became &quot;Jonovision&quot;&#x27;s highest-rated episode and is now regarded as a catalyst for the development of the revival &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation.&quot; Pat Mastroianni, who had spent most of the 2010s appearing at fan conventions across Canada, later organized &quot;Degrassi Palooza,&quot; a convention celebrating the legacy of the 1980s &quot;Degrassi&quot; series and featuring a reunion of 26 cast and crew members&quot;,&quot; at the Westin Toronto Airport Hotel in mid-June 2019.

<text>HMS &quot;Leeds Castle&quot; (P258) was a built by Hall, Russell &amp; Company of Aberdeen, Scotland for the Royal Navy. She was launched in October 1980 and commissioned the following August. She was involved in the 1982 Falklands War, operating between the British territories of Ascension Island, South Georgia, and the Falkland Islands as a dispatch vessel commanded by Lieutenant-Commander Colin Hamilton.

The &quot;Leeds Castle&quot; spent much time performing fishery protection duties around the United Kingdom, as well as being used as a guard ship in the Falkland Islands. In 2000, &quot;Leeds Castle&quot; underwent an eight-month refit, returning to the fleet in early 2001.

==Design and construction==
The was designed for fisheries protection and oilfield patrol duties in the United Kingdom&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). They were a follow-on to the interim which had been ordered in 1975 when the EEZ was extended to , and as a result of initial experience with the Islands, was considerably longer in order to improve seakeeping in heavy seas, with the extra length giving greater speed from the same power as the Islands and allowing a large helicopter deck to be fitted.

&quot;Leeds Castle&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. The ship was powered by two Ruston 12RK 320 DM diesel engines rated at (with a maximum sustained power of , driving two shafts fitted with controllable pitch propellers. This gave a speed of . The ship had a range of at .

The ship was initially armed with a single Bofors 40 mm L/60 gun, although by 1990 this had been replaced by an Oerlikon 30 mm gun on a DS30B mount. The main armament was supplemented by two 7.62 mm machine guns. A large helicopter deck was fitted aft, suitable for landing a Sea King or Chinook helicopter, but no hangar was provided, as the cost of a permanently embarked helicopter would be more than the cost of the ship. She was fitted with Type 1006 navigation radar, which was supplemented with a Type 994 air/surface search radar in 1989, together with a UAN(1) electronic intercept system (based on the Orange Crop system fitted to the Royal Navy&#x27;s helicopters. The ship had a crew of 6 officers and 39 other ranks, with room for a 25-man detachment of Royal Marines to be carried.

&quot;Leeds Castle&quot; was laid down at Hall, Russell &amp; Company&#x27;s Aberdeen shipyard as Yard number 985 on 18 October 1979 as the first of two Castle-class patrol vessels. This was in advance of a formal order for the two ships being placed, which did not take place until 8 August that year. She was launched on 22 October 1980, and was completed in December 1981.

==Service==
After commissioning and workup, &quot;Leeds Castle&quot;, assigned the pennant number P258, started fishery protection patrols around Shetland and in the English Channel in March 1982. On 2 April 1982, the Falklands War began when Argentine forces invaded the Falkland Islands. &quot;Leeds Castle&quot; was diverted from her normal North Sea patrol duties on 22 April, being fitted additional communications equipment and a desalination plant at HMNB Portsmouth before setting out for the Falklands on 29 April. She arrived in the Total Exclusion Zone on 21 May where she was employed as a despatch vessel, duties including acting as a refuelling platform for helicopters transferring stores between the transports , and near South Georgia on 27 May. She was then ordered to Ascension Island to serve as guardship, arriving there on 6 June 1982, before setting out again for the Falklands on 29 June, arriving at Port Stanley on 12 July. She set out on her return journey to the Britain on 24 July, arriving back at her home port of Rosyth on 20 August 1982.

In 1983, &quot;Leeds Castle&quot; took part in minelaying trials.

The ship was decommissioned in 2005 after a 24-year career having finished her final deployment as a patrol vessel based in the Falkland Islands. She was relieved in that role in 2004, returning to the UK in November.

===Sale to Bangladesh===
In April 2010 &quot;Leeds Castle&quot; was sold to Bangladesh along with &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot;. The two ships were refitted at the A&amp;P Group facility in Newcastle upon Tyne before being handed over. In 2010, &quot;Leeds Castle&quot; and &quot;Dumbarton Castle&quot; were renamed as the and of the Bangladesh Navy respectively.

<text>Gambusia is a large genus of viviparous fish in the family Poeciliidae (order Cyprinodontiformes). &quot;Gambusia&quot; contains over 40 species, most of which are principally found in freshwater habitats, though some species may also be found in brackish or saltwater habitats. The genus &quot;Gambusia&quot; comes from the Cuban term, &quot;Gambusino&quot;, which means &quot;free-lance miner&quot;. The type species is the Cuban gambusia, &quot;G. punctata&quot;. The greatest species richness is in Mexico, Texas, and the Greater Antilles, but species are also found elsewhere in the eastern and southern United States, the Bahamas, Central America, and Colombia. &quot;Gambusia&quot; species are often called topminnows, or simply gambusias; they are also known as mosquitofish, which, however, refers more specifically to two species, &quot;G. affinis&quot; and &quot;G. holbrooki&quot;, which are often introduced into ponds to eat mosquito larvae. As a consequence, they have been introduced widely outside their native range, and frequently become invasive, threatening local species. &quot;G. affinis&quot; and &quot;G. holbrooki&quot; are now established in many parts of the world and are likely to continue to spread as climatic conditions change. They are only occasionally kept in aquariums, due to their relative lack of color and the highly aggressive nature of the aforementioned mosquitofish species.

Nine species are listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List; two, the widemouth gambusia, &quot;G. eurystoma&quot;, and the crescent gambusia, &quot;G. hurtadoi&quot;, are critically endangered; and two, the Amistad gambusia, &quot;G. amistadensis&quot;, and the San Marcos gambusia, &quot;G. georgei&quot;, are already extinct.

==Species==

<doc id="548477" wikidata="Q1550397" url="?curid=548477" title="Grumman F7F Tigercat">
<text>The Grumman F7F Tigercat is a heavy fighter aircraft that served with the United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) from late in World War II until 1954. It was the first twin-engine fighter to be deployed by the USN. While the Tigercat was delivered too late to see combat in World War II, it did serve in reconnaissance roles. The Tigercat primarily saw action as a night fighter and attack aircraft during the Korean War.

Designed initially for service on &quot;Midway&quot;-class aircraft carriers, early production F7Fs were land-based variants. The type was too large to operate from older and smaller carriers, and only a late variant (F7F-4N) was certified for carrier service.

==Design and development==
Based on the earlier Grumman XP-50 that was eventually canceled, the company developed the XP-65 (Model 51) further for a future &quot;convoy fighter&quot; concept. In 1943, work on the XP-65 was terminated in favor of the design that would eventually become the F7F. The contract for the prototype XF7F-1 was signed on 30 June 1941. Grumman&#x27;s aim was to produce a fighter that outperformed and outgunned all existing fighter aircraft, and that had an auxiliary ground attack capability.

Performance of the prototype and initial production aircraft met expectations; the F7F was one of the fastest piston-engine fighters, with a top speed significantly greater than single-engine USN aircraft — 71 mph faster than a Grumman F6F Hellcat at sea level. Captain Fred Trapnell, one of the premier USN test pilots of the era, stated: &quot;It&#x27;s the best damn fighter I&#x27;ve ever flown.&quot; The F7F was to be heavily-armed — four 20 mm cannon and four 50 caliber (0.50 in; 12.7 mm) machine guns, as well as underwing and under-fuselage hardpoints for bombs and torpedoes. This speed and firepower was bought at the cost of heavy weight and a high landing speed, but what caused the aircraft to fail carrier suitability trials was poor directional stability with only one engine operational, as well as problems with the tailhook design. The initial production series was, therefore, used only from land bases by the USMC, as night fighters with APS-6 radar.

While the F7F was initially also known as the Grumman Tomcat, this name was abandoned, because it was considered at the time to have excessively sexual overtones; (from the 1970s, the name Tomcat became commonly associated with, and officially used by the Navy for, another Grumman design, the F-14 twin-jet carrier-based interceptor).
The first production variant was the single-seat F7F-1N aircraft; after the 34th production aircraft, a second seat for a radar operator was added and these aircraft were designated F7F-2N.

A second production version, the F7F-3, was modified to correct the issues that caused the aircraft to fail carrier acceptance, and this version was again trialled on the . A wing failure on a heavy landing caused the failure of this carrier qualification as well. F7F-3 aircraft were produced in day fighter, night fighter, and photo-reconnaissance versions.

The final production version, the F7F-4N, was extensively rebuilt for additional strength and stability, and did pass carrier qualification, but only 12 were built.

==Operational history==
The F7F Tigercat was produced too late to serve in its intended role in WWII; however, early F7F-1 models saw service in the Pacific Theatre before the end of the war. One Marine Corps photographic reconnaissance squadron equipped with the F7F, VMP-354, arrived in Guam in June 1945, and was quickly transferred to Yontan Airfield in Okinawa in July 1945. In July and August 1945, VMP-354 used the F7F to photograph potential invasion beaches for Operation Downfall in Southern Kyushu.

Marine Corps night fighter squadron VMF(N)-513 flying F7F-3N Tigercats saw action in the early stages of the Korean War, flying night interdiction and fighter missions and shooting down two Polikarpov Po-2 biplanes. This was the only combat use of the aircraft.

Most F7F-2Ns were modified to control drones for combat training, and these gained bubble canopies over the rear cockpit for the drone controller. An F7F-2D used for pilot transitioning also had a rear sliding, bubble canopy.

In 1945, two Tigercats, serial numbers &quot;TT346&quot; and &quot;TT349&quot;, were evaluated, but rejected by the British Royal Navy in favour of a naval version of the de Havilland Hornet.

==Surviving aircraft==


Beginning in 1949, F7Fs were flown to the then-U.S. Navy storage facility at Naval Air Station Litchfield Park, Arizona. Although the vast majority of the airframes were eventually scrapped, a number of examples were purchased as surplus. The surviving Tigercats were primarily used as water bombers to fight wildfires in the 1960s and 1970s and Sis-Q Flying Services of Santa Rosa, California, operated an F7F-3N tanker in this role until retirement in the late 1980s.

<text>Patrick Albert Moore (born June 15, 1947) is a Canadian industry consultant, former activist, an early member and past president of Greenpeace Canada. Since leaving Greenpeace in 1986, Moore has criticized the environmental movement for what he sees as scare tactics and disinformation, saying that the environmental movement &quot;abandoned science and logic in favor of emotion and sensationalism&quot;. Greenpeace has criticized Moore, calling him &quot;a paid spokesman for the nuclear industry, the logging industry, and genetic engineering industry&quot; who &quot;exploits long-gone ties with Greenpeace to sell himself as a speaker and pro-corporate spokesperson&quot;.

Since leaving Greenpeace, Moore has frequently taken sharp public stances against a number of major environmental groups, including Greenpeace itself, on many issues including forestry, nuclear energy, genetically modified organisms, and pesticide use. Moore has also denied the established consensus of the scientific community on climate change, for example by claiming that increased carbon dioxide in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is beneficial, that there is no proof that anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for global warming, and that even if true, increased temperature would be beneficial to life on Earth. These views are contradicted by the scientific consensus on the effects of global warming, which holds that climate change is expected to have a significant and irreversible negative impact on climate and weather events around the world, posing severe risks like ocean acidification and sea level rise to human society and to other organisms.

==Early life==
Moore was born in 1947 to Bill and Beverley Moore in Port Alice, British Columbia, and raised in Winter Harbour, on Vancouver Island. He is the third generation of a British Columbian family with a long history in forestry and fishing. His father, William D. Moore, was the president of the B.C. Truck Loggers Association and past president of the Pacific Logging Congress. Moore was educated at St. George&#x27;s School, then attended the University of British Columbia, where he obtained a B.Sc. in Forest Biology in 1969, and a Ph.D. in Forestry in 1974. For his PhD, Moore researched heavy metal contamination in Rupert Inlet by mine tailings. He concluded that existing mechanisms had failed to prevent unacceptable pollution.

==Career==

===Greenpeace===
The Don&#x27;t Make a Wave Committee (DMWC) was formed in January 1970 by Dorothy and Irving Stowe, Ben Metcalfe, Marie and Jim Bohlen, Paul Cote, and Bob Hunter and incorporated in October 1970. The committee had formed to plan opposition to the testing of a one megaton hydrogen bomb in 1969 by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. In 1971, Moore joined the committee as a member of the crew of the &quot;Greenpeace&quot;, a chartered fishing boat originally named the &quot;Phyllis Cormack&quot; which the Committee sent across the North Pacific to draw attention to the US testing of a 5 megaton bomb planned for September of that year. As Greenpeace co-founder Bob Hunter wrote, &quot;Moore was quickly accepted into the inner circle on the basis of his scientific background, his reputation [as an environmental activist], and his ability to inject practical, no-nonsense insights into the discussions.&quot; In May 1971, Moore travelled to Alaska with Jim Bohlen, representing the DMWC at US Atomic Energy Commission hearings. Moore attended DMWC meetings, and was part of the committee when its name was changed to the Greenpeace Foundation. Other committee members included committee founders Bob Hunter, Rod Marining and Ben Metcalfe. Moore describes himself as a founding member of Greenpeace, but the organization denies this claim.

Following US President Richard Nixon&#x27;s cancellation of the remaining hydrogen bomb tests planned for Amchitka Island in early 1972, Greenpeace turned its attention to French atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific. In May 1972, Moore travelled to New York with Jim Bohlen and Marie Bohlen to lobby the key United Nations delegations from the Pacific Rim countries involved. Moore then went to Europe together with Ben Metcalfe, Dorothy Metcalfe, Lyle Thurston and Rod Marining where they received an audience with Pope Paul VI and protested at Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral. In June, they attended the first UN Conference on the Environment in Stockholm where they convinced New Zealand to propose a vote condemning French nuclear testing, which passed with a strong majority.

Moore again crewed the &quot;Phyllis Cormack&quot; in 1975 during the first campaign to save whales, as Greenpeace met the Soviet whaling fleet off the coast of California. During the confrontation, film footage was caught of the Soviet whaling boat firing a harpoon over the heads of Greenpeace members in a Zodiac inflatable and into the back of a female sperm whale. The film footage made the evening news the next day on all three US national networks, initiating Greenpeace&#x27;s debut on the world media stage, and prompting a swift rise in public support of the charity. Patrick Moore and Bob Hunter appeared on Dr. Bill Wattenburg&#x27;s talk radio show on KGO and appealed for a lawyer to help them incorporate a branch office in San Francisco and to manage donations. David Tussman, a young lawyer, volunteered to help Moore, Hunter, and Paul Spong set up an office at Fort Mason. The Greenpeace Foundation of America (since changed to Greenpeace USA), then became the major fundraising center for the expansion of Greenpeace worldwide.

===Presidency of Greenpeace Foundation in Canada===
In January 1977 at the annual general meeting of the Greenpeace Foundation, Moore ran for president against Bob Hunter, eventually losing by a single vote. Soon after, Hunter stepped down and Moore assumed the presidency, inheriting an organization deeply in debt. Greenpeace organizations began to form throughout North America, including cities such as Toronto, Montreal, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, Boston, and San Francisco. Not all of these offices accepted the authority of the founding organization in Canada. Moore&#x27;s presidency and governance style proved controversial. Moore and his chosen board in Vancouver called for two meetings to formalize his governance proposals. During this time David Tussman, together with the rest of the founders, early activists of Greenpeace, and the majority of Greenpeace staff members announced that the board of the San Francisco group intended to separate Patrick Moore&#x27;s Greenpeace Foundation from the rest of the Greenpeace movement. After efforts to settle the matter failed, the Greenpeace Foundation filed a civil lawsuit in San Francisco charging that the San Francisco group was in violation of trademark and copyright by using the Greenpeace name without permission of the Greenpeace Foundation.

The lawsuit was settled at a meeting on October 10, 1979, in the offices of lawyer David Gibbons in Vancouver. Attending were Moore, Hunter, David McTaggart, Rex Weyler, and about six others. At this meeting it was agreed that Greenpeace International would be created. This meant that Greenpeace would remain a single organization rather than an amorphous collection of individual offices. McTaggart, who had come to represent all the other Greenpeace groups against the Greenpeace Foundation, was named chairman. Moore became president of Greenpeace Canada (the new name for Greenpeace Foundation) and a director of Greenpeace International. Other directors were appointed from the US, France, the UK, and the Netherlands. He served for nine years as president of Greenpeace Canada, as well as six years as a director of Greenpeace International.

In 1985, Moore was on board the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; when it was bombed and sunk by the French government.

===After Greenpeace===
In 1986, after leaving Greenpeace over differences in policy, Moore established Quatsino Seafarms—a family salmon farming business at his home in Winter Harbour—and became a director of the BC Salmon Farmers Association. He later commented that he left Greenpeace because it &quot;took a sharp turn to the political left&quot; and &quot;evolved into an organization of extremism and politically motivated agendas&quot;.

From 1990 to 1994 he was a member of the British Columbia Round Table on the Environment and the Economy and founded and chaired the B.C. Carbon Project. In 1991, he joined the board of the Forest Alliance of BC, an initiative of the CEOs of the major forest companies in British Columbia. As chair of the Sustainable Forestry Committee of the Forest Alliance he spent ten years developing the Principles of Sustainable Forestry, which were later adopted by much of the industry. In 1991, Moore also founded Greenspirit to &quot;promote sustainable development from a scientific environmental platform&quot;. In 2002, Tom Tevlin and Trevor Figueiredo joined Moore to form the environmental consultancy company Greenspirit Strategies Ltd.

Moore served for four years as vice president of environment for Waterfurnace International manufacturing geothermal heat pumps. In 2000, Moore published &quot;Green Spirit — Trees are the Answer&quot;, a photo-book on forests and the role they can play in solving some current environmental problems. He also made two appearances on &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!&quot; in episodes &quot;Environmental Hysteria&quot; (2003) and &quot;Endangered Species&quot; (2005). In 2006, Moore became co-chair (with Christine Todd Whitman) of a new industry-funded initiative, the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, which promotes increased use of nuclear energy. In 2010, Moore was recruited to represent the Indonesian logging firm Asia Pulp &amp; Paper (APP), a multi-national accused by activist groups of widespread and illegal rainforest clearance practices, although this is strongly disputed by Moore.

Moore is a policy advisor on climate and energy at The Heartland Institute (a conservative and libertarian think tank).

In March 2019, Donald Trump tweeted about an interview Moore gave on the Fox News program &quot;Fox &amp; Friends&quot;, where he denied that climate change was a threat. Moore also opposed Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&#x27;s Green New Deal, which is a resolution that aims to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the impact of climate change in the US. Moore called Ocasio-Cortez a &quot;twit&quot; and suggested that global warming might be beneficial as carbon dioxide is a &quot;building block of life&quot;. In the ongoing dispute between Moore and Greenpeace, the group continued to distance itself from Moore and his claims and views, including his denial of climate change.

==Views==
In 2005, Moore criticized what he said were scare tactics and disinformation employed by some within the environmental movement, saying that the environmental movement &quot;abandoned science and logic in favor of emotion and sensationalism&quot;. Moore contends that &quot;most of the really serious [environmental] problems have been dealt with&quot;, and that the environmental movement seeks to &quot;invent doom and gloom scenarios&quot;. He suggests they romanticize peasant life as part of an anti-industrial campaign to prevent development in less-developed countries, which he describes as &quot;anti-human&quot;. Moore was interviewed in the 2007 film documentary &quot;The Great Global Warming Swindle&quot;, in which he expressed similar views. In 2007 &quot;The Guardian&quot; said &quot;he is on record advocating the felling of tropical rainforests and the planting of genetically engineered crops&quot;. He has expressed his positive views of logging on the Greenspirit website.

===Energy===
Moore was opposed to nuclear power in the 1970s, when he &quot;believed that nuclear energy was synonymous with nuclear holocaust&quot; and &quot;everything nuclear was evil&quot;, but has since come to be in favour of it.

Moore co-chaired the Clean and Safe Energy Coalition, which was supported by the Nuclear Energy Institute, a national organization of pro-nuclear industries.
In 2009, as co-chair of the Coalition, he suggested that the mainstream media and the environmentalist movement are not as opposed to nuclear energy as in decades past.

He argues that any realistic plan to reduce reliance on fossil fuels or greenhouse gas emissions would require increased use of nuclear energy to supply baseload power. He has also criticized the costs and reliability of wind farms.

===Global climate change denial===
In 2006, he disagreed with the scientific consensus on climate change in a letter to the Royal Society, arguing there was &quot;no scientific proof&quot; that mankind was causing global climate change and believes that it &quot;has a much better correlation with changes in solar activity than levels&quot;. He has falsely claimed that there is no scientific evidence that carbon dioxide contributes to climate change.

Moore has stated that global climate change and the melting of glaciers is not necessarily a negative event because it creates more arable land and the use of forest products drives up demand for wood and spurs the planting of more trees. Rather than climate change mitigation, Moore advocates adaptation to global warming. This, too, is contrary to the general scientific consensus, which expects climate change to lead to some irreversible impacts.

A March 2014 episode of the American program &quot;Hannity&quot; featured Moore making the statement that the Earth &quot;has not warmed for the last 17 years&quot; in a debate with pundit Bob Beckel. Politifact, a political fact checking website operated by the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;, rated Moore&#x27;s assertion &quot;mostly false&quot;, remarking that a significant net warming over that time frame had occurred even though the spread was relatively flat as well as that Moore cherry-picked the time frame to obscure the overall heating trend.

===Genetically modified foods===
In 2006, Moore addressed a Biotechnology Industry Organization conference in Waikiki saying, &quot;There&#x27;s no getting away from the fact that over 6 billion people wake up each day on this planet with real needs for food, energy and materials&quot;, and need genetically engineered crops to this end.

Moore supports the adoption of golden rice to prevent vitamin A deficiency.

=== Attacks on Greta Thunberg ===
Moore has claimed that climate change activist Greta Thunberg is &quot;evil&quot;, described her as a &quot;puppet&quot; with a mental disorder, compared the individuals he alleges are controlling her to &quot;Hitler&quot;, and accused her parents of abusing her.

==Criticism==
Moore has earned his living since the early 1990s primarily by consulting for, and publicly speaking for, a wide variety of corporations and lobby groups such as the Nuclear Energy Institute. Moore&#x27;s work as a lobbyist has prompted criticism from environmental activists, who have accused him of acting as an advocate for many of the industries that Greenpeace was founded to counter. His critics point out Moore&#x27;s business relations with &quot;polluters and clear-cutters&quot; through his consultancy. Monte Hummel, president of the World Wildlife Fund Canada, has claimed that Moore&#x27;s book &quot;Pacific Spirit&quot; is a collection of &quot;pseudoscience and dubious assumptions&quot;.

The writer and environmental activist George Monbiot has written critically of Moore&#x27;s work with the Indonesian logging firm Asia Pulp &amp; Paper (APP). Moore was hired as a consultant to write an environmental &#x27;inspection report&#x27; on APP operations. According to Monbiot, Moore&#x27;s company is not a monitoring firm and the consultants used were experts in public relations, not tropical ecology or Indonesian law. Monbiot has said that sections of the report were directly copied from an APP PR brochure.

The Nuclear Information and Resource Service, an anti-nuclear group, criticized Moore, saying that his comment in 1976 that &quot;it should be remembered that there are employed in the nuclear industry some very high-powered public relations organizations. One can no more trust them to tell the truth about nuclear power than about which brand of toothpaste will result in this apparently insoluble problem&quot; was seen as forecasting his own future. A &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; editorial criticizes the press for uncritically printing &quot;pro-nuclear songs&quot; such as Moore&#x27;s, citing his role as a paid spokesperson of the nuclear industry.

During an interview by French investigative journalist Paul Moreira, which was first broadcast on French television station Canal+, Moore was asked about the safety of the herbicide glyphosate. Moore told Moreira that one &quot;could drink a whole quart of it&quot; without any harm. When Moore was challenged to drink a glass of the weedkiller, he refused, saying &quot;I&#x27;m not an idiot&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m not stupid&quot; before ending the interview. Monsanto, the primary producers of glyphosate weedkillers under the Roundup brand, denied claims that Moore is a paid lobbyist for their company. The interview came shortly after the release of a World Health Organization (WHO) report adding glyphosate to a list of probable carcinogens.

<text>Animal hoarding, sometimes called Noah syndrome, is keeping a higher-than-usual number of animals as domestic pets without the ability to properly house or care for them, while at the same time denying this inability. Compulsive hoarding can be characterized as a symptom of a mental disorder rather than deliberate cruelty towards animals. Hoarders are deeply attached to their pets and find it extremely difficult to let the pets go. They typically cannot comprehend that they are harming their pets by failing to provide them with proper care. Hoarders tend to believe that they provide the right amount of care for them. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals provides a &quot;Hoarding Prevention Team&quot;, which works with hoarders to help them attain a manageable and healthy number of pets.

==Characteristics of a hoarder==
An animal hoarder keeps an unusually large number of pets for their premises, and fails to care for them properly. A hoarder is distinguished from an animal breeder, who would have numerous animals as the central component of their business; this distinction can be problematic, however, as some hoarders are former breeders who have ceased selling and caring for their animals, while others will claim to be breeders as a psychological defense mechanism, or in hopes of forestalling intervention. Gary Patronek, director of the Center for Animals and Public Policy at Tufts University, defines hoarding as the &quot;pathological human behavior that involves a compulsive need to obtain and control animals, coupled with a failure to recognize their suffering&quot;. According to another study, the distinguishing feature is that a hoarder &quot;fails to provide the animals with adequate food, water, sanitation, and veterinary care, and... is in denial about this inability to provide adequate care.&quot; Along with other compulsive hoarding behaviors, it is linked in the DSM-IV to obsessive–compulsive disorder and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. The DSM-5 includes a diagnosis of hoarding disorder.

Alternatively, animal hoarding could be related to addiction, dementia, or even focal delusion.

The number of animals involved alone is not a determinative factor in identifying hoarding. Instead, the issue is the owner&#x27;s inability to provide care for the animals and the owner&#x27;s refusal to acknowledge that both the animals and the household are deteriorating. For instance, in one animal hoarding case, 11 cats were seized from a trailer. The deputy police officer testified that the trailer smelled so strongly of feline waste that despite experiencing severe congestion at the time of the investigation, she had a hard time staying in there for more than a few minutes. The deputy further testified that she could not step anywhere in the trailer without stepping on fresh, old, or smeared fecal matter, and that even the stove and sink were filled with bio-hazardous waste. Yet, a Canadian woman, who died leaving 100 properly fed, spayed/neutered, vaccinated, and groomed cats, was not considered an animal hoarder because her animals were properly cared for.

The Hoarding of Animals Research Consortium (HARC) identifies the following characteristics as common to all hoarders:
* Accumulation of numerous animals, which has overwhelmed that person&#x27;s ability to provide even minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, and veterinary care;
* Failure to acknowledge the deteriorating condition of the animals (including disease, starvation, and even death) and the household environment (severe overcrowding, very unsanitary conditions); and
* Failure to recognize the negative effect of the collection on their own health and well-being, and on that of other household members.

Compulsive hoarding can be characterized as a symptom of mental disorder rather than deliberate cruelty towards animals. Hoarders are deeply attached to their pets and find it extremely difficult to let the pets go. They typically cannot comprehend that they are harming their pets by failing to provide them with proper care. Hoarders tend to believe that they provide the right amount of care for their pets.

==Legal solutions==
===United States===
====Animal cruelty statutes====
In the United States, animal hoarders can be prosecuted under state animal cruelty laws for failing to provide a certain level of care to their animals. The following provides some examples of the standards currently in effect. In Alaska, the cruelty statute defines a minimum standard of care for animals that includes (1) food and water sufficient to maintain each animal in good health; (2) an environment compatible with protecting and maintaining the good health and safety of the animal; and (3) reasonable medical care at times and to the extent available and necessary to maintain the animal in good health. Likewise, in Colorado, a person commits cruelty to animals if he or she knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence deprives an animal of necessary sustenance, neglects any animal, allows the animal to be housed in a manner that results in chronic or repeated serious physical harm, or fails to provide the animal with proper food, drink, or protection from the weather consistent with the species, breed, and type of animal involved. In Colorado&#x27;s animal cruelty statute, &quot;neglect&quot; means failure to provide food, water, protection from the elements, or other care generally considered to be normal, usual, and accepted for an animal&#x27;s health and well-being consistent with the species, breed, and type of animal.

Since failure to provide proper care for animals is an act of omission or neglect rather than an affirmative act, the failure to care for an animal is considered a misdemeanor offense in most states. For instance, in Alaska, if an animal owner fails to provide the aforementioned standards of care, the state has prima facie evidence of a failure to care for an animal. If the prosecutor can prove the owner&#x27;s failure to care for an animal was done with criminal negligence and the failure to care for the animal caused its death or severe physical pain or prolonged suffering, then the owner may be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. In Colorado, failure to provide an animal with the proper standard of care is a Class 1 misdemeanor. In Virginia, each owner must provide for each of his companion animals: adequate feed; adequate water; adequate shelter that is properly cleaned; adequate space in the primary enclosure for the particular type of animal depending upon its age, size, species, and weight; adequate exercise; adequate care, treatment, and transportation; and veterinary care when needed to prevent suffering or disease transmission. Violation of these standards is a Class 4 misdemeanor. A second or subsequent violation may result in a higher grade misdemeanor. Likewise, under Virginia&#x27;s animal cruelty statute, any person who deprives any animal of necessary food, drink, shelter or emergency veterinary treatment is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

However, some states, like California and New Hampshire, may provide felony provisions for depriving an animal of necessary sustenance, drink, and shelter. In Colorado, it is a class 6 felony upon a second or subsequent conviction of animal cruelty. In Maine, a person who is guilty of cruelty to animals may face criminal or civil charges at the discretion of the state&#x27;s attorney.

====Penalties under state animal cruelty statutes====
Penalties for failing to provide proper care or medical care to animals under state animal cruelty statutes can include fines, animal forfeiture, the cost of care for the seized animals, and jail time. Since animal hoarding is sometimes associated with mental illness, a situation may arise when an alleged animal neglecter is found incompetent to stand trial due to a mental disability and thus remains the rightful owner of the animals he or she has neglected (i.e. the animals were not forfeited). In the Matter of a Protective Order for Jean Marie Primrose, for example, after a tip from a veterinarian, police confiscated 11 cats from a woman&#x27;s feces and urine covered, rat infested trailer in Oregon; the cats were then placed in the care of a rescue organization. The woman was charged with criminal second degree animal neglect. After being diagnosed with a mild case of mental retardation, however, the judge found the woman unable to aid and assist in her own defense. The second degree charge was thereby dismissed. Since the woman was not convicted of a crime, her rights to the 11 cats were not forfeited. Yet, from the time the cats were seized to the time of the dismissal, the rescue organization accrued more than $30,000 in cat care fees. The rescue organization therefore placed a lien on the cats, meaning the woman could not get her cats back until she paid off her debt. After the dismissal of the case, however, the woman never made any attempt to contact the rescue organization about returning her cats. The fate of the cats therefore remained in limbo. The rescue organization could have either kept the cats and kept accruing care fees because not being rightful owners, they could not place the cats into homes, or forgiven the debt and returned the cats to the woman. Since the rescue organization felt the woman was incapable of adequately caring for the cats and since the organization did not want to invest more money that would likely remain uncompensated, the organization filed a petition for a limited protective order as a fiduciary for the care and placement of the cats. The probate court ruled against the organization, but the appeals court overturned the lower court&#x27;s order and held that the probate court did indeed have authority to enter a limited protective order under ORS 125.650 as a &quot;fiduciary necessary to implement a protective order.&quot; The probate court, then, granted the limited protective order and the organization was allowed to place the cats into new homes. This case was considered a landmark by the Animal Legal Defense Fund.

In addition to jail time, animal forfeiture, and fines, a state, such as California, may allow courts to order psychological counseling at the court&#x27;s discretion or may require the defendant to undergo anger management, such as the case in Colorado. Prosecutors may also be able to request bans on future pet ownership or request limits on the number of animals a convicted hoarder may keep. For instance, in &quot;ALDF v. Conyers&quot;, over one hundred dogs and nine birds were confiscated from the defendants&#x27; home. About 70 of those dogs had severe oral disease, disintegrating jaws, and scarred corneas. One dog, who was caged in the basement, could barely stand up and kept soiling himself, which lead to his skin being scalded from the urine and feces. An officer also noticed the dog&#x27;s tongue hanging out of his mouth, but later learned that his tongue was sticking out because his jaw had disintegrated. The Animal Legal Defense Fund moved for a permanent injunction to enjoin the defendants from owning animals from the date of the court&#x27;s final judgment to 10 years.

====Criticism of applying animal cruelty laws to hoarding====
Although animal hoarders can be prosecuted under state animal cruelty laws, many scholars maintain that basic animal cruelty laws are inefficient in prosecuting hoarders. As Stephan Otto, director of legislative affairs for the Animal Legal Defense Fund explains: &quot;Only a handful of states allow felony charges for the worst kinds of animal neglect ... They also need stronger laws that take into account when multiple numbers of animals were in involved in a case.&quot; HARC&#x27;s research on 56 animal hoarding cases illustrates Otto&#x27;s point:

Prosecutors and judges, however, discourage multiple charges, believing that they &quot;clog&quot; the system. The difficulty of proving each charge also accounts for this discouragement. In order to bring one charge of cruelty for each animal, prosecutors and animal agencies must provide proof of cruelty to each animal, matching each animal with its count number. Charging the hoarder with only one count reduces the burdens on the system, the prosecutors, and the animal agencies, but undermines the severity of the charges.

====Hoarding-specific laws====
Only two states have laws regarding the hoarding of animals: Illinois and Hawaii.

Passed in 2001, the Illinois Humane Care for Animals Act was amended to include a definition a companion animal hoarder and mandated psychological counseling for animal hoarders who violate Section 3. A person convicted of violating section 3 of the Act (which requires the provision of food and water, adequate shelter and protection from the weather, veterinary care, and humane care and treatment) is guilty of a misdemeanor with a second or subsequent violation raising the offense to a Class 4 felony. One commentator, Victoria Hayes, JD, believed that although Illinois&#x27; legal definition of a &quot;companion animal hoarder&quot; is a step in the right direction, the definition does not provide any extra tools to a prosecutor. Animal hoarding itself is not prohibited by the statute, she said, and the prosecutor must still show a violation of Section 3 of the Humane Care for Animals Act. It is important to note that animal hoarding itself is not prohibited by the Illinois statute.

Hawaii, on the other hand, specifically outlaws animal hoarding. In 2008, animal hoarding became a misdemeanor offense. Hawaii&#x27;s Penal Code now provides:

(1) A person commits the offense of animal hoarding if the person intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly;

(2) Animal hoarding is a misdemeanor.

Hawaii&#x27;s law specifically criminalizes hoarding, while depriving an animal of necessary sustenance can also constitute a separate offense of animal cruelty. The hoarding law differs from ordinances that limit the number of pets a person can have because it only prohibits keeping more than fifteen dogs and cats if the owner fails to provide necessary care for the animals and that failure causes injury to the animals or the owner.

An important aspect of the law is that prosecutors may be able to charge hoarders with one count of animal hoarding that covers all of the animals. When hoarding is prosecuted under state animal cruelty laws, prosecutors must charge hoarders with multiple counts of animal cruelty—one for each animal on the premises. By creating the offense of &quot;hoarding&quot;, Hawaii&#x27;s law seems to allow prosecutors to charge hoarders with one count of animal hoarding that covers every animal the person has hoarded, easing the prosecution&#x27;s burden of providing documentation of each individual animal&#x27;s injury. This will also decrease the cumbersome burden multiple charges can place on courts. Prosecutors will also be able to bring separate charges of animal cruelty for individual animals whose injuries are easiest to document.

Hawaii&#x27;s statute does not mandate psychological counseling for convicted hoarders or restrict future animal ownership.

Anti-hoarding legislation has been proposed, but not passed, in several other states.

====Hoarding-specific municipal ordinances====
While a state may not have an animal hoarding specific statute, its municipalities may have animal hoarding specific ordinances. For instance, the city of Alto, Georgia&#x27;s ordinance specifically prohibits hoarders. The ordinance defines a hoarder as a person or entity that:
If a person is convicted of being a hoarder under this ordinance, that person may not own, possess, or have on his premises in Alto any animal for one year from the date of conviction. The person may also be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 and/or by imprisonment in the common jail of the town not to exceed six months.
The Animal Law Coalition has a Model Animal Hoarding Specific Ordinance (available under &quot;Resources&quot; at its website) that can be adapted by various communities.

More controversially, a municipality may limit the number of pets a person is allowed to keep in his or her home in hopes of preventing animal hoarding. These are called pet limitation ordinances. Gary J. Patronek, in The Problem of Animal Hoarding, Municipal Lawyer 6 (2001), stated that pet limitation ordinances are &quot;wildly unpopular, difficult to enforce, and likely to be opposed by a broad coalition of pet fanciers, breeders, rescue groups, and animal protection organizations.&quot; While a hoarding specific ordinance, like Alto, prohibits keeping numerous animals in conditions that are harmful to the animals&#x27; health, pet limitation ordinances simply prohibit keeping more than a certain number of animals regardless of the level of care provided to the animals. As mentioned previously in this article, the number of animals involved alone is not a determinative factor in identifying hoarding and it is possible for a person to successfully care for a large number of animals. Examples of pet limitation ordinances include: Aurora, Colorado and Banks County, Georgia. In Banks County, Georgia, the number of dogs a person can own differs based on the zone in which the person&#x27;s property is located.

Some pet limitation ordinances, however, provide exemptions to the pet restrictions. For instance, in Great Falls, Montana, a person who owns or harbors any more than the number of dogs and cats permitted by the ordinance for a period of more than thirty (30) days must obtain a multiple animal permit. Additionally, a breeder can be exempt from the ordinance by obtaining a Multiple Animal Hobby Breeder Permit. These exemptions are, no doubt, provided to lessen the opposition and problems of pet limitation ordinances.

====Problems with prosecuting hoarders====

Prosecuting animal hoarding cases is &quot;complex, time consuming, and costly; as made evident in the Primrose case, the high cost of caring for animals rescued from hoarders, who often must be cared for at the rescuer&#x27;s expense, is a huge disincentive for prosecuting these types of cases. Especially since the animal rescue operation may never be compensated for its expenses. Further, as Dr. Gary Patronek explains, &quot; don&#x27;t really have the tools they need to fully go after these cases ... and they often don&#x27;t have the support of other agencies that they need.&quot; This lack of communication among various governmental agencies, such as code enforcement, the health department, and animal control, impedes the detection of animal hoarders and thereby the prosecution of hoarders.
Further, since animal hoarding cases do not get widespread attention, they do not garner community support, which is also a disincentive for prosecution. Additionally, officials may opt to forgo charges or enter into lenient plea-bargains in exchange for custody of the animals because they fear that the animals will languish in shelters while prosecution is pending. These attempts to &quot;strike a balance between helping both the hoarder and the animals involved&quot; are generally ineffective because of high recidivism rates among hoarders.
When hoarders are prosecuted, there is broad inconsistency in the number and severity of charges brought. These inconsistencies may arise because some prosecutors and judges discourage multiple charges, believing that they &quot;clog&quot; the system. The difficulty of proving each charge also accounts for these inconsistencies. In order to bring one charge of cruelty for each animal, prosecutors and animal agencies must provide proof of cruelty to each animal, matching each animal with its count number. Adversely, charging the hoarder with only one count reduces the burdens on the system, the prosecutors, and the animal agencies, but undermines the severity of the charges. Laws that create a separate offense of animal hoarding may solve this problem by allowing one count of hoarding to be brought in every case that encompasses the hoarding aspect of the charge rather than focusing on each individual count of cruelty.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, an RSPCA spokeswoman said the society was campaigning for legislation to monitor people who take in large numbers of animals.

==Dangers==
The health issues in animal hoarding encompass a variety of concerns related to both individual and public health. Animal hoarding is the cause of many severe health risks that threaten the hoarded animals, individuals living in hoarding residences, and surrounding neighbors.

=== Health effects on animals ===
Due to the harmful effects on the health of the animals involved, animal hoarding is considered a form of cruelty to animals. Hoarders often fail to provide basic care for their animals, thus resulting in disease and often death. The primary animal health issues involved are malnourishment and problems related to overcrowding and neglect. Consequences of hoarding are long-lasting and continue to affect the animals even after they have been rescued and provided with better care.

==== Malnourishment ====
Lack of sufficient food and water is a common feature of hoarding situations. The immediate consequence of this is starvation and death. One study found at least one dead animal present in over half of examined cases, the leading cause of death being an insufficient food and water supply. Malnourishment also leads to increased susceptibility to disease, and the hoarded animals are often in advanced stages of sickness. Furthermore, when there is a limited food supply, animals may resort to aggressive behavior in competing for available food, killing and sometimes even eating other animals.

==== Overcrowding ====
Overcrowding also leads to acute animal health problems in hoarding situations. The number of animals found in hoarding cases range from dozens to several hundreds, with extreme cases involving over a thousand animals. Animals are confined to houses, apartments, or trailer-homes. In one case, 306 cats were removed from a home, 87 of which were dead. Corpses were found embedded in the chimney and living room furniture. In addition to lack of living space, overcrowding facilitates the spread of diseases among animals. Furthermore, in cases where more than one species is confined to the same living space, animals can pose a danger to one other due to inter-species aggression.

==== Owner neglect ====
Various other health problems arise from hoarders&#x27; neglect of the animals and inability to provide basic care for them. Lack of veterinary attention is notable among these. Hoarders, refusing to acknowledge the deteriorating health conditions of their animals and scared they will be forced to give up custody, often refuse to take their animals to veterinarians. As a result, diseases are left untreated and allowed to become more severe. Another problem tied to neglect is poor sanitary conditions for the animals. Basic animal waste management is absent in virtually all animal-hoarding situations, and animals are filthy and often infected with parasites as a result. Furthermore, animals suffer behaviorally from a lack of socialization caused by an absence of normal interaction with other animals.

==== Lasting consequences ====
Many of these health problems continue to cause suffering even after the animals are rescued. Strained animal shelters or humane societies, forced to prioritize when dealing with numerous rescued animals, may be unable to provide immediate treatment to many animals. Furthermore, many of the rescued animals, due to health or behavioral problems, may not be suitable for adoption. Euthanasia, even in cases where the animals are not beyond rehabilitation, is often the only option for rescued animals. The effects of hoarding on the health and socialization of the animals involved are severe and lasting, taking heavy tolls on both their physical and psychological well-being.

=== Health effects on humans ===
Animal hoarding also causes many health problems for the people involved. Hoarders, by definition, fail to correct the deteriorating sanitary conditions of their living spaces, and this gives rise to several health risks for those living in and around hoarding residences. Animal hoarding is at the root of a string of human health problems including poor sanitation, fire hazards, zoonotic diseases, envenomation, and neglect of oneself and one&#x27;s dependents.

==== Sanitation concerns ====
Poor sanitation practices, a general characteristic of hoarding households, pose health risks to both animals and humans. In typical hoarding residences, animal waste is found coating interior surfaces, including beds, countertops, and cupboards. In one case, floors and other surfaces were found to be covered in a six-inch layer of feces and garbage.

In addition to severe odors which may pose a nuisance to neighbors, animal waste poses serious health risks through both the spread of parasites and the presence of noxious ammonia levels. OSHA, the United States agency regulating air quality standards in work-related environments, has identified an ammonia level of 300 parts per million as life-threatening for humans; in many hoarding cases the atmospheric ammonia level in the housing space approaches this number, requiring the use of protective clothing and breathing apparati during inspections or interventions. In an extreme case, the ammonia level in the hoarder&#x27;s house was 152 parts per million even after ventilation.

The presence of animal waste also prevents sanitary storage and preparation of food, which puts residents at risk of contracting food-related illnesses and parasites. Insect and rodent infestation can both follow and worsen hoarding conditions, and can potentially spread to the surrounding environment including to nearby buildings. In one case, an elementary school had to be shut down due to a flea infestation that had spread from a nearby dog hoarder residence.

Hoarders are frequently found to collect large numbers of inanimate objects in addition to animals, giving rise to clutter as well. Hoarded objects can include newspapers, trash, clothing, and food; the clutter inhibits normal movement around the house, hampering household maintenance and sanitary food preparation, heightening the risk of accidents, and contributing to the overall level of squalor. A lack of functioning toilets, sinks, electricity, or proper heating (often due to hoarders not paying bills, though poor maintenance may also be a cause) further exacerbates the problem. Fire hazards comprise yet another health issue tied to poor sanitation; the clutter found in many hoarding households prevents workable fire escape plans and serves as possible fuel when located close to heat sources. The risk is amplified when hoarders, due to inoperative heating systems, seek alternate heating methods such as fireplaces, stoves, or kerosene heaters.

==== Zoonotic diseases ====
Another human health issue caused by animal hoarding is the risk of zoonotic diseases. Defined as &quot;human diseases acquired from or transmitted to any other vertebrate animal&quot;, zoonotic diseases can often be lethal and in all cases constitute a serious public health concern. Examples of well-known zoonotic diseases include bubonic plague, influenza, and rabies. Common domesticated animals constitute a large portion of animals carrying zoonoses, and as a result, humans involved in animal hoarding situations are at particular risk of contracting disease. Zoonoses that may arise in hoarding situations—through vectors such as dog, cat, or rat bites—include rabies, salmonellosis, catscratch fever, hookworm, and ringworm. One zoonosis of special concern is toxoplasmosis, which can be transmitted to humans through cat feces or badly-prepared meat, and is known to cause severe birth defects or stillbirth in the case of infected pregnant women. The risk of zoonotic diseases is amplified by the possibility of community epidemics.

==== Self-neglect and child/elder abuse ====

The problems of self-neglect and elder and child abuse are also health problems associated with animal hoarding. Self-neglect can be defined as &quot;the inability to provide for oneself the goods or services to meet basic needs&quot;, and has been shown to be an &quot;independent risk factor for death&quot;. While self-neglect is a condition generally associated with the elderly, animal hoarders of any age can and do experience it. This is demonstrated by the fact that hoarders&#x27; lifestyles often match the degenerate sanitary conditions that surround them. Child and elder abuse arise when dependents are living with the hoarder. According to one study, dependents lived with hoarders in over half of the cases. As with his or her animals, the hoarder often fails to provide adequate care for dependents both young and old, who suffer from a lack of basic necessities as well as the health problems caused by unsanitary conditions. In one case, two children of a couple hoarding 58 cats and other animals were forced to repeat kindergarten and first grade because of excessive absence due to respiratory infections. Self-neglect and neglect of dependents make up a major human health concern of animal hoarding.

== Mental health issues ==
Evidence suggests that there is &quot;a strong mental health component&quot; in animal hoarding, though it has not been firmly linked to any specific psychological disorder. Models that have been projected to explain animal hoarding include delusional disorder, attachment disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, zoophilia, dementia, and addiction. Direct evidence for most is lacking, however.

=== Delusional disorder ===
Animal hoarders display symptoms of delusional disorder in that they have a &quot;belief system out of touch with reality&quot;. Virtually all hoarders lack insight into the extent of deterioration in their habitations and on the health of their animals, refusing to acknowledge that anything is wrong. Furthermore, hoarders may believe they have &quot;a special ability to communicate and/or empathize with animals&quot;, rejecting any offers of assistance. Delusional disorder is an effective model in that it offers an explanation of hoarders&#x27; apparent blindness to the realities of their situations.

=== Attachment disorder ===
Another model that has been suggested to explain animal hoarding is attachment disorder, which is primarily caused by poor parent-child relationships during childhood. It is characterized by an inability to form &quot;close relationships [with other humans] in adulthood&quot;. As a result, those with attachment disorder may turn to animals for companionship. Interviews with animal hoarders have revealed that hoarders have often experienced domestic trauma in childhood, which is the basis of the evidence for this model.

=== Obsessive–compulsive disorder ===
Perhaps the strongest psychological model put forward to explain animal hoarding is obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). An overwhelming sense of responsibility for something is characteristic of people with OCD, who then take unrealistic measures to fulfill their perceived duty. Animal hoarders often feel a strong sense of responsibility to take care of and protect animals, and their solution—that of acquiring as many animals as they possibly can—is unrealistic. Further, the hoarding of inanimate objects, practiced by a majority of animal hoarders, is a fairly common occurrence in people with OCD. These connections between animal hoarding and obsessive–compulsive disorder suggest that OCD may be a useful model in explaining animal hoarding behavior. However, this theory has also been refuted by some; Dr. Akimitsu Yokoyama theorizes that animal hoarding could be explained using Asperger syndrome.

==Popular culture and fiction==
* On the Animal Planet TV series &quot;Confessions: Animal Hoarding&quot;, friends and family of animal hoarders intervene to offer them support to make a change in the form of psychological help and veterinary care or placement for their pets.
* In the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, animal hoarding is represented by the semi-recurring character Crazy Cat Lady Eleanor Abernathy. She is a mentally ill old woman covered by cats, who is often seen speaking in gibberish and throwing cats at people.
* In Ann Bannon&#x27;s novel &quot;Journey to a Woman&quot;, Vega&#x27;s mother and grandfather own an excessive number of cats and could be considered to be animal hoarders.
* In webtoon &quot;Lookism&quot;, an arc featuring an animal hoarder who nabbed both Daniel Park and Johan Song&#x27;s dogs.

<text>Portobello is a village beside the Otago Harbour halfway along the Otago Peninsula in Dunedin City, New Zealand. It lies at the foot of a small peninsula (Portobello Peninsula) between Portobello Bay and Latham Bay.

Like scores of Dunedin features, Portobello was named after a locality in Edinburgh, Scotland, also called Portobello.

At the end of Portobello Peninsula sits a marine research station, the Portobello Marine Laboratory, which is part of the University of Otago. Close to the end of this peninsula lies Quarantine Island / Kamau Taurua.

Portobello features a Historical Society Museum, the &quot;1908&quot; Restaurant, a local primary school (Portobello School, Years 1-8), the old Portobello Hotel (a pub), a cafe and several accommodation providers, including a camping ground, bed and breakfasts and motels. A local dairy acts as the community&#x27;s grocers, though most of the village&#x27;s retail needs are served by Dunedin city.

The winding but well-surfaced Portobello Road runs along the edge of the harbour, connecting Portobello to the city. A multi-year project to raise and widen this road and add a 19km shared-use pathway, now named Te Aka Ōtākou, was completed in 2023, safely connecting Portobello to Dunedin for cyclists and walkers and allowing a full loop around the harbour via the ferry to Port Chalmers. A more convoluted but scenic route, Highcliff Road, connects Portobello with Dunedin city centre via the ridge of the peninsula.

Boating is an historical focus for Portobello. In the past, Portobello residents caught the ferry to the city, before the Portobello Road along the foreshore was constructed. Today, scheduled ferry service to Kamau Taurua and Port Chalmers departs from the recently renovated ferry jetty, a short distance from the centre of the village. A boating club maintains a slipway and boat shed near the jetty.

Portobello Community Inc. is the local community group, which works to improve Portobello for its community.

<text>The Irish Chamber Orchestra (ICO) is an Irish classical music ensemble, administratively based at the University of Limerick.
János Fürst founded the ICO in 1963. The ICO consisted only of strings as its regular ensemble for many years, adding wind, brass and percussion players on a freelance basis when needed. The ICO was reformed in 1970 under the name of the New Irish Chamber Orchestra and the principal conductorship of André Prieur. The orchestra first toured North America in 1978. In 1995, the orchestra was again reconstituted, reverting to its original name of the Irish Chamber Orchestra. 

== Overview ==

<doc id="548500" wikidata="Q834318" url="?curid=548500" title="Mau movement">
<text>The Mau was a non-violent movement for Samoan independence from colonial rule during the first half of the 20th century. &quot;Mau&quot; means &#x27;resolute&#x27; or &#x27;resolved&#x27; in the sense of &#x27;opinion&#x27;, &#x27;unwavering&#x27;, &#x27;to be decided&#x27;, or &#x27;testimony&#x27;; also denoting &#x27;firm strength&#x27; in Samoan. The motto for the Mau were the words Samoa mo Samoa (Samoa for the Samoans). Similarly in Hawaiian &quot;Mau&quot; means to strive or persevere, and is often linked with Hawaiian poetry relating to independence and sovereignty struggles.

The movement had its beginnings on the island of Savai&#x27;i with the &quot;Mau a Pule&quot; resistance in the early 1900s with widespread support throughout the country by the late 1920s. As the movement grew, leadership came under the country&#x27;s chiefly elite, the customary &quot;matai&quot; leaders entrenched in Samoan tradition and fa&#x27;a Samoa. The Mau included women who supported the national organisation through leadership and organisation as well as taking part in marches. Supporters wore a Mau uniform of a navy blue lavalava with a white stripe which was later banned by the colonial administration.

The Mau movement culminated on 28 December 1929 in the streets of the capital Apia, when the New Zealand military police fired on a procession who were attempting to prevent the arrest of one of their members. The day became known as &quot;Black Saturday&quot;. Up to 11 Samoans were killed, including Mau leader and one of the paramount chiefs of Samoa Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III with many others wounded. One New Zealand constable was clubbed to death by protesters following the outbreak of hostilities.

The Mau movement&#x27;s efforts would ultimately result in the political independence of Samoa in 1962 but the height of the movement&#x27;s activity in the Western Islands occurred in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

==History==
Broadly, the history of the Mau movement can be seen as beginning in the 19th century with European contact and the advent of Western powers, Britain, United States and Germany, vying for control of the Pacific nation. The country became German Samoa (1900–1914).

===Formation of &quot;Mau a Pule&quot;===
A key event occurred in 1908, in a dispute between the German colonial administration and the &quot;Malo o Samoa&quot;, or Samoan Council of Chiefs, over the establishment of a copra business owned and controlled by native Samoans.
The dispute led to the eventual formation of a resistance movement called &quot;Mau a Pule&quot; on Savai&#x27;i by Lauaki Namulau&#x27;ulu Mamoe, one of the Samoan leaders from Safotulafai who was deposed by the German Governor of Samoa, Wilhelm Solf. As well as deposing members of the &quot;Malo o Samoa&quot;, Solf called in two German warships as a show of strength. Lauaki returned with his warriors from Savai&#x27;i for battle. The German governor convinced Mata&#x27;afa to set up a &quot;peace talk meeting&quot; with Lauaki but that Lauaki had to disperse his army before the meeting. Unknown to Mata&#x27;afa was the intent of the German governor to rid of Lauaki. Lauaki, a man of honor, returned with his warriors to Savai&#x27;i as they were reluctant to leave Upolu without him. After ensuring his warriors&#x27; arrival to their villages, Lauaki returned to Upolu. As it took Lauaki several days to disperse his army, the German governor set up his trap.

Upon their return to Upolu, Lauaki and some of the Chiefs were betrayed at this &quot;peace talk&quot;, held aboard the German ship. In 1909, Lauaki and the other senior leaders of the &quot;Mau a Pule&quot; were exiled to the German colonies in the Marianas (North West Pacific) where they were to stay until 1914, when New Zealand took over Samoa as part of its Empire duties at the outbreak of World War I. Many of those exiled died before returning to Samoa. Lauaki died en route back to Samoa in 1915.

In 1914, at the beginning of World War I, New Zealand forces, unopposed by the Germans, annexed Western Samoa.

===Influenza epidemic===

Military rule by New Zealand continued after the war ended, and in 1919, some 7,500 Samoans, around 22 per cent of the population, died during an influenza epidemic. It was already known that Samoans were most susceptible to minor European diseases, as they had never encountered them before. When the ship &quot;SS Talune&quot; arrived in Apia with its crew and passengers obviously sick with influenza, they were allowed to dock by the New Zealanders.

Two days later the first deaths were reported. No attempt was made by the New Zealand administrators to quell or contain the spread, and after one week it had spread through the whole of Samoa. Whole families were killed, with such alarming speed that corpses lay around for weeks without being buried. They were either thrown in mass graves or left in houses which were torched. However, in American Samoa, where quarantine precaution measures had been adequately taken, there were no deaths. Upon learning of the situation in Western Samoa, the American Governor offered help to Colonel Robert Logan who was in charge; Logan was a Scotsman who hated Americans. He destroyed the telegram and cut off any other contact to American Samoa. The Americans had a large medical team who could have saved many lives.

This catastrophic event was to lay a new foundation for discontent with an administration already perceived as incompetent and dishonest by many Samoans. The clumsy handling of Samoa&#x27;s governance, the slow and deliberate erosion of traditional Samoan social structures by successive administrators, and a general failure to understand and respect Samoan culture also sowed the seeds for a revitalised resistance to colonial rule. Logan was replaced by Colonel Robert Tate.

===Mau leadership===
The groundswell of support among Samoans for the Mau came from the leadership of Samoan &quot;matai&quot;, the heads of families in Samoa&#x27;s traditional socio-political structure. Family and chiefly title connections, a central part of Samoan culture, were used to harness support. The success of the Mau in gathering national support showed that &quot;fa&#x27;a Samoa&quot; was still strong despite colonialism.

An example of this is found in the many stories of the Mau, in its early days as the fledgling movement began seeking support from matai. One of the urgent matters the early leadership faced was on the question of Savaii, as &quot;Pule&quot; (the senior orators and polity heads of Savaii) were yet to pledge their unanimous support. The position of its traditional rulers needed attention if the movement was to gain national appeal. The sensitive cultural maneuvering required for such an undertaking required more than the methods employed by those in Apia and so it was decided that &quot;Tumua&quot; (the senior orators and polity heads of Upolu) would travel to Savaii and ask for their support for the fledgling movement. The fleet of &quot;fautasi&quot; (canoes) embarked with Upolu&#x27;s orators on board, led by the &quot;matua&quot; of Falefa, Luafalemana Moeono Taele, who after resigning his post in the administration&#x27;s police force, joined the Mau. Choosing to arrive at Satupa&#x27;itea instead of the traditional Sale&#x27;aula, Moeono met with Asiata and in asking for his support, recalled Falefa&#x27;s earlier support for the &quot;Mau a Pule&quot; (a precursor to the Mau Movement led Savaii&#x27;s orators during the German administration). By recalling this, Asiata was compelled to assist and joined &quot;Tumua&quot; as they went on to Sale&#x27;aula. There, Moe&#x27;ono, Asiata and &quot;Tumua&quot; met with the assembled &quot;Pule&quot; and called on them to reciprocate their earlier solidarity by joining forces with &quot;Tumua&quot; in order to further strengthen the cause for independence.

Samoans of mixed parentage, facing discrimination from both cultures but with the advantage of cross-cultural knowledge, also played a key role in the new movement.

Olaf Frederick Nelson, one of the leaders of the new Mau movement, was a successful merchant of mixed Swedish and Samoan heritage. Nelson was the richest man in Samoa at the time and well-travelled. He was frustrated by the colonial administration&#x27;s exclusion of native and part-Samoans from governance. Notably, he was one of many who had lost a child to the influenza epidemic of 1919 in addition to his mother, sister, only brother, and sister in-law. Although classified as a European, he considered himself Samoan &quot;by birth, blood, and sentiment.&quot;

In 1926, Nelson visited Wellington to lobby the New Zealand government on the issue of increased self-rule. During his visit, the Minister for External Affairs, William Nosworthy, promised to visit Samoa to investigate. When Nosworthy postponed his trip, Nelson organised two public meetings in Apia, which were attended by hundreds, and The Samoan League, or &quot;O le Mau&quot;, was formed.

The Mau published the &quot;Samoa Guardian&quot; newspaper as a mouthpiece for the movement. To demonstrate the extent of popular support for the Mau, Nelson organised a sports meeting for movement members on the King&#x27;s Birthday, in parallel with the official event, and held a well-attended ball at his home on the same night.

Movement members had begun to engage in acts of noncooperation: Neglecting the compulsory weekly search for the rhinoceros beetle, enemy of the coconut palm, thereby threatening the lucrative copra industry. When New Zealand administrators imposed a per-capita beetle quota, many Samoan villages resisted by breeding the insects in tightly woven baskets rather than comply with the orders to scour the forests and collect them.

In 1927, alarmed at the growing strength of the Mau, George Richardson, the administrator of Samoa, changed the law to allow the deportation of Europeans or part-Europeans charged with fomenting unrest. This action was presumably taken on the assumption that the growing movement was merely a product of self-interested Europeans agitating the native Samoans.
In reality, however, the Mau was built upon the traditional forms of Samoan political organisation. In each village that joined the movement, a committee was formed, consisting of the chiefs and &quot;talking men&quot;. These committees formed the basic element of an alternative system of governance, and the tendency of Samoans to unite under traditional leadership meant that by the mid- to late 1920s, around 85% of the Samoan population was involved in open resistance.

Following another visit to New Zealand to petition the Government, Nelson was exiled from Samoa along with two other part-European Mau leaders, Alfred Smyth and Edwin Gurr. The petition, which led to the formation of a joint select committee to investigate the situation in Samoa, quoted an ancient Samoan proverb: &quot;We are moved by love, but never driven by intimidation.&quot;

===Civil disobedience===
The Mau remained true to this sentiment, and despite the exile of Nelson, continued to use civil disobedience to oppose the New Zealand administration. They boycotted imported products, refused to pay taxes and formed their own &quot;police force&quot;, picketing stores in Apia to prevent the payment of customs to the authorities. Village committees established by the administration ceased to meet and government officials were ignored when they went on tour. Births and deaths went unregistered. Coconuts went unharvested, and the banana plantations were neglected.
As the select committee was forced to admit, &quot;a very substantial proportion of Samoans had joined the Mau, a number quite sufficient, if they determined to resist and thwart the activities of the Administration, to paralyse the functions of government.&quot;

Richardson sent a warship and a 70 strong force of marines to quell the largely non-violent resistance. 400 Mau members were arrested, but others responded by giving themselves up in such numbers that there were insufficient jail cells to detain them all, and the prisoners came and went as they pleased. One group of prisoners found themselves in a three-sided &quot;cell&quot; which faced the ocean, and were able to swim away to tend to their gardens and visit their families.

With his attempt at repression turning to ridicule, Richardson offered pardons to all those arrested; however, those arrested demanded to be dealt with by the court, and then refused to enter pleas to demonstrate their rejection of the court&#x27;s jurisdiction.

==Black Saturday, 29 December 1929==

The new administrator, Stephen Allen, replaced the marines with a special force of New Zealand police, and began to target the leaders of the movement. Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, who had led the movement following the exile of Nelson, was arrested for non-payment of taxes and imprisoned for six months.

On 29 December 1929 – which would be known thereafter as &quot;Black Saturday&quot; – New Zealand military police fired upon a peaceful demonstration which had assembled to welcome home Alfred Smyth, a European movement leader returning to Samoa after a two-year exile. Reports of the massacre are sketchy because the official cover-up for the incident was so effective. Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III had rushed to the front of the crowd and turned to face his people; he called for peace from them because some were throwing stones at the police. With his back to the police calling for peace he was shot in the back; another Samoan who rushed to help him was shot in both legs while cradling his head. Another who had attempted to shield his body from the bullets was shot. Two more rushing to help were killed before they could reach him.

Shooting stopped at around 6.30 p.m. Eight had died, three would later die, and about 50 were wounded. One policeman had also been clubbed to death.
Among the wounded were terrified women and children who had fled to a market place for cover from New Zealand police firing from the verandah of the station, one of them wielding a Lewis machine-gun.

In the Mau&#x27;s darkest period came its finest hour. As he lay dying, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III knew that a bloody conflict would ensue between the Mau and New Zealand forces as a result of his death. Recognising the need for peaceful resistance if the Mau was to achieve its goal, Tamasese made this statement to his followers: &quot;My blood has been spilt for Samoa, I am proud to give it. Do not dream of avenging it, as it was spilt in peace. If I die, peace must be maintained at any price&quot;.
After his burial, the Colonel Allen visited Vaimoso with a troop of special police in a show of force and chastised the Mau leadership. Assembled at Vaimoso were Mau members, senior matai and legions of followers, still mourning the slaying of their leader. One writer recalled how close the Governor was that night to &quot;losing his head&quot;, had it not been for Lealofi III&#x27;s parting words to his followers.

Following the massacre, the NZ police continued to use excessive force against the Mau men, going so far as to raid their homes and villages in order to capture and arrest them. This drove the Mau men into hiding in fear of arrest or exile, and so in order to continue the movement, the Women&#x27;s Mau emerged days after the men had been forced to hide from the administration. The women&#x27;s swift response to the tragic events of Black Saturday was made evident across the Pacific through Mau leader Taisi Olaf Nelson&#x27;s telegram to New Zealand&#x27;s Labor Party:

“...SAMOAN WOMEN ACTIVE ORGANIZING NEW MOVEMENT UNPARALLED IN SAMOAN HISTORY..”

The four leading women of this movement were Ala Tamasese (widow of High Chief Tamasese Lealofi II), Rosabel Nelson (wife of G.P. Nelson and daughter of H.J. Moors a prominent European businessman), Paisami Tuimalealiifano (wife of Chief Tuimalealiifano), and Faamusami Faumuina (wife of High Chief Faumuina Fiame and daughter of the late King Malietoa Laupepa). These women, along with the many other women of the Mau, had taken charge, not only of hiding and protecting the Samoan men, but also of continuing the movement&#x27;s political affairs such as holding meetings, writing letters of complaint and petitions to the NZ administration, organizing protests, etc. Many scholars of the Mau Movement attribute the Women&#x27;s Mau for being key to the success of the movement and the subsequent gaining of Samoa&#x27;s independence in 1962.

The day after his funeral, his village was raided by New Zealand military police; they ransacked houses, including those of the Tamasese&#x27;s mourning widow and children. Colonel Allen requested reinforcements from New Zealand after he claimed 2,000 Mau had caused a riot.
On 12 January 1930 the Royal New Zealand Navy flagship &quot;Dunedin&quot; brought marines to hunt down members of the Mau. The Mau, who were fully committed to passive resistance, easily slipped through the bush; the marines were slow because they were carrying too much weaponry and didn&#x27;t know the bush like the Mau. The Mau no longer trusted New Zealand police, and this fear only got worse after a 16-year-old unarmed Samoan was shot and killed while running away from a marine, whose excuse he thought the boy was going to throw a stone was accepted as an adequate defence and no charges were laid.

A truce was declared on 12 March 1930, after another child was killed by New Zealand marines who were now suffering heat exhaustion and tropical infections. The male Mau members returned to their homes, on the condition that they retain their right to engage in non-cooperation. Meanwhile, Nelson and other exiled leaders continued to lobby the New Zealand Government and communicate their progress to the Mau. In 1931, news of the growing Indian independence movement reached Samoa, partially inspiring the Mau movement.

==Moving towards independence==
After 5 years in exile in New Zealand, Nelson returned to Samoa in May 1933, and continued his advocacy. General Hart, the New Zealand administrator, demanded that Nelson be excluded from any meeting (fono) with the leadership of the Mau. The Mau insistence that Nelson should be one of its delegates. General Hart ordered police raids on the Mau&#x27;s headquarters at Vaimoso and Nelson&#x27;s residence at Tuaefu, which occurred on 15 November 1933. Eight Samoan chiefs, leaders of the Mau, who were members of a conference of 100 assembled at Tuatuanu’u were arrested on charges of collecting monies for unlawful purposes and engaging in Mau activities. A week later a further 7 chiefs were arrested at Savaii.

Six months after his return to Samoa, Nelson was convicted of 3 charges of being connected to the Mau for which he was sentenced to ten additional years in exile as well as eight months imprisonment in New Zealand. The Mau movement had not gone unnoticed by the population of New Zealand, and the treatment of Samoans at the hands of the administration had become a contentious issue in some New Zealand electorates during the New Zealand general election in 1935, which was won by Labour. Nelson&#x27;s exile was cut short in 1936. He returned to Samoa, and helped in the signing of the co-operation agreement between Samoan leaders and the New Zealand administration. He was subsequently elected to the Legislative Council in 1938 and re-elected in 1941.

1936 marked a turning point for Samoa, with the election of a Labour Government in New Zealand and the subsequent relaxation of repression by the New Zealand administration in Samoa. In the following years, there was slow movement towards greater involvement of Samoans in the administration of their own country, with a Samoan Parliament (Fono) being opened on 30 September 1936 at Mulinuʻu with elected representatives, to supersede the parliament composed of Samoans appointed by the New Zealand Administration. There were further acts of civil disobedience, including a sit-in protest in parliament over the payment of the representatives. In 1946, after the end of the Pacific War, a Fono of representative of the districts of Samoa voted to reject a Trusteeship Agreement put forward by New Zealand, with the Fono stating a desire for self-government.

==1962 independence==
When Western Samoa gained its independence in 1962, Tupua Tamasese Meaole, younger brother of the Mau leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III and his successor, became its first co-head of state with Malietoa Tanumafili II.

Fiamē Mataʻafa Faumuina Mulinuʻu II (1921–1975), the son of another high chief and Mau leader Mataʻafa Faumuina Fiame Mulinuʻu I, became the first Prime Minister of Samoa.

In July 1997, the Samoa Constitution was amended to change the country&#x27;s name to Samoa, and officially the Independent State of Samoa.

==New Zealand apology to Samoa==
In 2002, Helen Clark, Prime Minister of New Zealand made an unprecedented move and apologised to Samoa for New Zealand&#x27;s treatment of Samoans during the colonial era. Clark made the apology in the capital Apia during the 40th anniversary of Samoa&#x27;s independence. The apology covered the influenza epidemic of 1918, the shooting of unarmed Mau protesters by New Zealand police in 1929 and the banishing of matai (chiefs) from their homes.

==An American Samoa Mau==
The Mau movement was an indigenous opposition to the U.S. annexation of the eastern Samoan islands in 1899, and had manifestations in both the Western and Eastern Samoan island groups. It featured the signing of petitions in efforts to enact political transformation vis-a-vis American colonial government, and included effort to resist taxation of copra.

There was an American Samoa Mau that took place in Tutuila in American Samoa in the 1920s. It emerged as a result of fluctuating prices of copra and represented an open affront to the American Navy and its patterns of treatment of the indigenous Samoan people and failure to respect Samoan customs, conceptions of self-government and the Samoan way of life. This movement received a lot of press in the United States, both favourable and unfavourable.

The Mau movement, called O le Mau in Samoan, has also been known in American Sāmoa by several other names, including The Committee of Samoan Chiefs, The Samoan Movement, The Samoan Cause, The Samoan League, and The Committee of the Samoan League.

The leader of the movement, Samuel Sailele Ripley of Leone, Tutuila, was in effect exiled from American Samoa, when he was barred by the US Navy authorities from disembarking from a ship returning to American Samoa from California, and he was never allowed to return to his homeland. He eventually became the mayor of Richmond, California.

The United States sent a committee to American Samoa in 1930, including US citizens from Hawaii who had a prominent role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani. Their report, favourable to the US position, had a considerable influence on US policy, and the American Samoa Mau was totally suppressed by the US. Its influence however continued to be felt.

==Contemporary influences==
A Samoan hip hop group that was founded in 1990 by Kosmo, M.C. Kha Tha Feelstyle Orator and D.J. Rockit V. The Mau was named for the Mau movement. The motto of the group became the same as the motto of the Mau movement: &quot;Samoa Mo Samoa&quot; (&quot;Samoa for Samoans&quot;). The Mau has now reformed as the group Rough Opinion. The group still carries the message of the Mau movement as their theme.

He co-designed with Vincent Rijmen the Rijndael cipher, which was selected as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 2001. More recently, he co-designed the Keccak cryptographic hash, which was selected as the new SHA-3 hash by NIST in October 2012.
 He has also designed or co-designed the MMB, Square, SHARK, NOEKEON, 3-Way, and BaseKing block ciphers. In 2017 he won the Levchin Prize for Real World Cryptography &quot;for the development of AES and SHA3&quot;. He describes his development of encryption algorithms as creating the bricks which are needed to build the secure foundations online.

In 1988, Daemen graduated in electro-mechanical engineering at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. He subsequently joined the COSIC research group, and has worked on the design and cryptanalysis of block ciphers, stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. Daemen completed his PhD in 1995, at which point he worked for a year at Janssen Pharmaceutica in Beerse, Belgium. He subsequently worked at the BACOB bank, Banksys, Proton World and then STMicroelectronics.

<text>Otago Harbour is the natural harbour of Dunedin, New Zealand, consisting of a long, much-indented stretch of generally navigable water separating the Otago Peninsula from the mainland. They join at its southwest end, from the harbour mouth. It is home to Dunedin&#x27;s two port facilities, Port Chalmers (half way along the harbour) and at Dunedin&#x27;s wharf (at the harbour&#x27;s end). The harbour has been of significant economic importance for approximately 700 years, as a sheltered harbour and fishery, then deep water port.

==Geography==
The harbour was formed from the drowned remnants of the giant Dunedin Volcano, centred close to what is now Port Chalmers. The remains of this violent origin can be seen in the basalt of the surrounding hills. The last eruptive phase ended some ten million years ago, leaving the prominent peak of Mount Cargill. The ancient and modern channel runs along the western side of the harbour, the eastern side being shallow, with large sandbanks exposed at low tide. Two islands form a line between Port Chalmers and Portobello half way along the harbour—Goat Island / Rakiriri and Quarantine Island / Kamau Taurua. The nearby smaller island known as Pudding Island (Titeremoana) lies close to the Peninsula shore and can be reached by foot at low tide. The Water of Leith flows into the harbour at its southern end, which along with numerous streams lowers the salinity of the harbour water.

==Biology==

===Seabirds===

Similar to the Otago Peninsula, the harbour water is known for various rare wildlife. The area is the home of many species of wading birds. Other bird species which visit the harbour include two species of penguins, the blue penguin and the rare yellow-eyed penguin. Taiaroa Head, at the tip of the Otago Peninsula, is home to the only &quot;mainland&quot; colony of northern royal albatrosses in the world.

===Marine mammals===

The bay and peninsula provides a critical habitat for Hooker&#x27;s sea lions and New Zealand fur seals. Southern elephant and leopard seals are occasional visitors into the harbour. In total, four species of pinnipeds, and at least nine or more species of cetaceans are known to inhabit or migrate through the area.

The outer peninsula adjacent to Taiaroa Head is one of three main congregating areas for dusky dolphins in New Zealand waters and the harbour and peninsula hosts important areas for breeding and nursing. Bottlenose dolphins and critically endangered, endemic Hector&#x27;s dolphins also frequent the water. Other species such as common dolphins and orcas also visit the harbour entrance, where orcas and dusky dolphins have been seen interacting without violence. Southern right whales were historically seen inside the entrance of the harbour possibly up to Quarantine and Goat Island / Rakiriri. They used the shallow, calm water for nursing calves before commercial whaling wiped them out locally. The number of humpback whales visiting the peninsula have increased as this species recovers much faster than the southern rights. There have also been observations of blue whales, minke whales, and long-finned pilot whales.

== History ==

Māori first arrived at Otago Harbour in the 1300s, soon after they first settled in New Zealand. Being too far south for the cultivation of sweet potato they adopted a hunter-gatherer society. This initially involved sealing and fishing in the harbour, with the latter dominating as seal stocks diminished. This time in the history of the harbour is recorded in place names such as Kamau Taurua (Quarantine Island), which means &quot;a place where nets are set&quot;.

===The first European ships===

Captain Cook never entered Otago Harbour, but speculated that it existed when he was off the Pacific coast in 1770. It is not known exactly when the first Europeans (likely sealers) entered the harbour, though Māori oral tradition puts it some time &#x27;long before&#x27; 1810. Written records of this time are restricted to a handful of journals and newspaper accounts of sailors who only stayed briefly. George Bass made the Dunedin end of the harbour the north east limit of his proposed fishing monopoly in 1803. The American ship &quot;Favourite&quot; and its supercargo Daniel Whitney may have called in the summer of 1805 to 1806. Daniel Cooper, master of the London sealer &quot;Unity&quot;, probably did call in the summer of 1808 to 1809 when his Chief Officer, Charles Hooper, probably gave his name to Hooper&#x27;s Inlet on the Otago Peninsula. William Tucker (1784–1817) was with a gang employed by Robert Campbell, a Sydney merchant, who were dropped on islands off the Dunedin coast in November 1809. Tucker and Daniel Wilson were at Otago Harbour on 3 May 1810 when Robert Mason, master of the &quot;Brothers&quot;, anchored in the harbour and picked him up. This is the first explicit and identifiable reference to a European ship in Otago Harbour. The court record containing it, made in 1810, refers to the harbour as &#x27;Port Daniel&#x27;, a name which stayed in use for some years.

===The sealers and whalers===

Another English sealer, the &quot;Sydney Cove&quot;, under Captain Charles McLaren, was anchored in the harbour late in 1810 when Te Wahia&#x27;s theft of a knife, a red shirt, and some other articles sparked what has been called &quot;The Sealers&#x27; War&quot;.
A much-discussed affray in that conflict occurred after James Kelly of Hobart anchored the &quot;Sophia&quot; in the harbour in December 1817 with William Tucker on board. After a visit to nearby Whareakeake (Murdering Beach), where Tucker had been living since 1815, and where he and two other men were killed, Kelly took revenge on Māori on his ship in the harbour, including local chief Korako. He then burnt a harbourside village, &#x27;the beautiful City of Otago&#x27;, probably on Te Rauone Beach.

Peace was achieved in 1823, and on 17 July of that year John Rodolphus Kent of the Naval cutter &quot;Mermaid&quot; from New South Wales, while in the harbour, took &#x27;the liberty of naming it (as it has not hitherto been named) &quot;Port Oxley&quot;, in honour of the Surveyor General of the Colony&#x27;, John Oxley (1783/85?–1828). As noted, however, it had already been named. In 1826 Thomas Shepherd, one of a party of intending colonists, explored the site of Dunedin and left the oldest surviving pictures of the harbour and nearby coast, now in the Mitchell Library in Sydney.

From its origins as a secret sealers&#x27; haven, Otago Harbour developed into a busy international whaling port after the Weller brothers established their whaling station at Te Umu Kuri, Wellers Rock, at what is now called Otakou in November 1831. The busiest whaling port south of the Bay of Islands, it was also the hub of the largest European population in New Zealand after the Bay of Islands/Hokianga district by the end of 1839. By that time whaling had collapsed and Dumont D&#x27;Urville and his officers, visiting in 1840, observed the port had become the centre of a riotous trade in liquor and prostitution. This continued until the Scottish settlers arrived in 1848 and made Port Chalmers and Dunedin the new population centres on the harbour.

===Harbour developments and alterations===

While Otago Harbour might have the appearance of an excellent deep-water port, it was not naturally suited to such a role, especially in the early days of settlement when ships needed to dock close to the city. The flat land at the southern end of the harbour and close to the isthmus of Otago Peninsula was ideally suited for a city (and was the site for Dunedin), but the harbour itself could naturally accommodate deep-drafted ships only as far as Port Chalmers. At Port Chalmers, two islands (Quarantine Island / Kamau Taurua and Goat Island / Rakiriri) almost bisect the harbour. Beyond them, the harbour is shallow and silty, and mudflats are often visible at low tide. In 1946 Otakou Fisheries was started based out of the township of the same name on the eastern side of the harbour. This was later to become a major part of the Otago fishing industry.

As the city grew, and particularly with the increase in commerce that developed following the Otago gold rush of the 1860s, it became desirable to provide a means for ships to reach the city&#x27;s wharves. Though a contentious and expensive decision, it was agreed to dredge a channel along the northwestern side of the harbour. The channel was finally opened on 30 December 1881. The initial channel was narrow and shallow, and did not get off to an auspicious start, as the Union Steam Ship Company&#x27;s SS &quot;Penguin&quot;, the first ship to use it, was temporarily grounded while using it. The channel was officially named the Victoria Channel by Keith Ramsay, chairman of the Otago Harbour Board. A significant area at the head of the harbour — much of it referred to as the Southern Endowment — has been reclaimed since the founding of Dunedin, primarily for industrial use. Smaller portions have also been reclaimed at a number of places around the harbour, including Port Chalmers, Macandrew Bay, and Broad Bay.

As finance allowed, the channel was gradually widened and deepened, and by 1907 twice as many ships were using Dunedin&#x27;s wharves as used Port Chalmers. It was only with the advent of Port Chalmers&#x27; container port in the early 1970s that the Victoria Channel again became quiet. The channel is maintained by Port Otago Ltd, which keeps it dredged to a depth of eight metres, allowing ships of up to 40,000 tonnes deadweight to travel up the harbour to Dunedin. Much of the channel&#x27;s larger traffic in the early 21st century is oil transport to Dunedin city and chemicals and fertiliser to and from Ravensbourne&#x27;s fertiliser works.

Aramoana, at the harbour mouth, has twice been projected as the site for New Zealand&#x27;s second aluminium smelter. The proposals, in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, were abandoned after major public protest. The harbour is tidal, shallow and seldom rough and for that reason is popular for water sports such as yachting and windsurfing.

== Infrastructure and transport ==
Substantial container port facilities exist at Port Chalmers, along the western shore from the harbour mouth. A channel along the western side of the harbour is regularly dredged, allowing vessels with a draught of 12.5 m to Port Chalmers, and 8 m all the way to the heart of Dunedin. New Zealand&#x27;s frozen meat export trade was inaugurated at Port Chalmers in 1882. Portobello is home to one of New Zealand&#x27;s leading marine research establishments, the Portobello Marine Laboratory, a department of the University of Otago. This lies at the harbour&#x27;s edge on the tip of a small arm of the Otago Peninsula, the Portobello Peninsula. There are currently numerous sightseeing and fishing boats that can be chartered and one scheduled ferry from Port Chalmers to Portobello.

The harbour is flanked by major roads leading from Dunedin to Port Chalmers (SH 88) and to Portobello and Otakou (Portobello Road). A long-distance cycleway and walkway, Te Aka Ōtākou, runs parallel to both roads along the harbour&#x27;s edge for . It was completed in 2023 and links Port Chalmers and Portobello. The South Island Main Trunk railway also runs parallel to the state highway on the western side of the harbour. Both of these routes cross causeways to navigate several of the harbour&#x27;s bays, notably at Blanket Bay, between St Leonards and Port Chalmers.

The town is known for its saree industry which is a traditional business and centuries old art of the people of this city; says, Pallavi Mishra.

==History==
From historical and archaeological point of views, Mau is one of the oldest places in the region. Ancient cultural and archaeological remains have been found at multiple places in the area giving enough evidence of long history of human habitat in the area. The known archaeological history of Mau is about 1500 years old, when the entire area was covered under thick dense forest. The nuts who used to live along Tamsa river, are considered to be the oldest inhabitants and the ruler of the area.

As per the records on official webpage of the district, in 1028 A.D. King Syed Shalar Masood Ghazi came with a huge army to conquer the area but he went back to Afghanistan, leaving few of his people in the area. A Sufi saint Baba Malik Tahir and his brother Malik Qasim were part of the remaining group. There are places like Malik Tahir Pura and Qasim Pura in the name of these two saints in Mau city. The tomb of Malik Tahir is also present in Malik Tahir Pura and locally known as Mazaar Malik Tahir Baba.

Around 1540-1545, Sher Shah Suri, the famous emperor who defeated Humayun, during his reign visited Kolhuvavan (Madhuban) to meet the great Sufi saint Syed Ahmad Wadva. Mahvani, one of the daughters of Sher Shah had settled permanently near the dargah of Syed Wadva. The area also finds place in the historical book of Ziyaudeen Barni with a description that the great Mughal emperor Akbar passed through Mau on his way to Allahabad. Since time immortal, labourer and artisans who were the original inhabitants of this land has kept the fine saree art work alive and despite a gradual decline of the handloom industry in the eastern Uttar Pradesh, the saree industry of Mau still remains the last bastion of handicraft in the area otherwise an industrially thriving region till the end of last century. It is also believed that one of Shah Jahan&#x27;s daughter, Jahanara Begum had also settled in that area where she built a mosque. The original structure of the mosque is not surviving anymore but place is known as Shahi Qatra and there is a Shahi Mosque in that locality reminding of its past glory. 
During the Indian freedom struggle, the people of Mau had given full support to the movement, and Mahatma Gandhi had also made a visit to Doharighat region of the district in 1939.

In 1932, Azamgarh was made independent district, Mau region was a part of it until 1988 when the current area of Mau district was carved out of Azamgarh on 19 November 1988 to make Mau a separate district in which the then Union Minister of State of India (Power) Kalpnath Rai played a pivotal role. He is also credited to start an array of developmental activities in the city including new Railway Station and a stadium.

The known archival history of Mau is about 1500 years old, when the entire area was a dense forest. The wild and tribal castes used to live around the river flowing here. The oldest inhabitants of this place are considered to be nuts. He also ruled this area.

Baba Malik Tahir arrived around 1028 in this area, settled thousands of years ago on the Tamsa coast. He was a Sufi saint and came here with a detachment of army along with his brother Malik Qasim. The then ruler of these people was sent by Sayyid Shalar Maud Ghazi to capture this area here. At that time, while capturing other parts of the country, Ghazi had come to Satrik in Barabanki and from there he sent troops to capture different parts.

In those days Mau Nut ruled this region. A fierce battle ensued between Mau Nut and Malik brothers over the occupation, in which Mau Nut was cracked (killed) and this area was called Mau Nat Bhanjan which later became Maunath Bhanjan.

After establishing his supremacy over this area, Baba Malik Tahir made his center north of the place where the check is today, which is still known as Malik Tahirpura. Similarly his brother Malik Qasim settled the south of the Czech in the name of Kasimpura. The rank soldiers who were part of Malik Tahir’s army populated the areas at some distance in their own names, which are still present in the form of Husainpura, Bulakipura, Mirzahadipura, Kasimpura, Mohsinpura, Nyaz Muhammadpura, Pathantola, etc. After the arrival of Malik brothers, this area gradually got populated.

After the Deep Nirvana of the Maurya and Gupta kings, this place was under the Jaunpur state during the Mughal rule. Before this, between 1540-1545, the then emperor Sher Shah Suri arrived twice in this area. Sher Shah Suri had come to meet the Sufi saint Mirashah living in the dargah. His daughter Mahabano was living in the company of Mirashah. The old bridge of Mau Nagar, which became dilapidated in the floods of 1956, was built by Sher Shah Suri. It is said that due to the delay in the construction of the bridge, the historic road (Grant Tunk Road) built by Sher Shah Suri from Peshawar to Kolkata could not pass through here.

In 1629, during the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, this area was given to his daughter Jahanara. The foundation of the present form of the city was laid during the reign of Jahanara. Jahanara Begum got her residence and Shahi Masjid built here at Katra and for her protection it was converted into a military cantonment. The remains of the barracks built to house the army still exist today. Jahanara had also built an underground tunnel 16 to 17 feet below in the royal Katra area, the remains of which are still found during excavations under the ground. Last year, the two places where bore wells were done in Katra area of the local municipality failed by going 17–18 feet. In the south-west part of the royal chambers in Katra was the residence of the royal family. Here was the relic of Imam Khana till the last days. The furnishings of the royal family were brought here on mules. The generation of those who brought them are still settled here and make their living by doing the work of transportation by mules. Laborers, artisans and other trained laborers also came along with the Mughal family, who gave birth to the art of weaving here. People who spun yarn associated with handloom weaving came and settled here from Gorakhpur. Two mohallas, Katuapura East and Katuapura West were built for his stay. It is told that in the name of brother Aurangzeb Begum Jahanara settled a new mohalla Aurangabad and renamed Maunath Bhanjan after her name as Jahanabad, but this name could not be popular and Maunath Bhanjan continued to progress progressively.

It is noteworthy that when Jahanara Begum was making new constructions here, apart from the laborers who came here with her, most of the people who came here were artisans and the main class among them was the cloth makers who settled here permanently. Most of the artisans who came here were of Iranian, Afghani or Turkish origin. In the local language of Mau, which is considered unique in its own way, most of the words are found in Persian, Turkish and Iranian languages, which have lost their original meaning today.

In the beginning of the eighteenth century, this land was given to Raja Azamshah of Azamgarh after separating it from the rule of Jaunpur. Azam Shah and Azmat Shah were both real brothers. Azamshah built Azamgarh Azmat Shah built Azmatgarh.

In 1801, Azamgarh and Maunath Bhanjan were acquired by the East India Company and this area was included in Gorakhpur district. In the year 1932, Azamgarh was made an independent district, which lasted till 1988 after independence. In the erstwhile district Azamgarh district, maximum revenue was received from Mau, but the effort for its development was negligible. Due to the district headquarters being 45 km away from here, the people of this place had to face great inconvenience. The demand for making Mau a district continued for many years, which was finally fulfilled on November 19, 1988 and Mau was created as a separate district in the map of the state.

After the formation of a new district in the year 1988, this land has been rejuvenated and  is on the path of continuous progress.

== Economy ==
Mau is industrial town of eastern UP. After demise of textile industry of Banaras and Mubarakpur, Mau stands as one of the last bastion of textile hubs of UP. A 1998–99 survey of Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) puts number of powerlooms at 58,381.

There are speculations that this huge industry will benefit if GI is awarded to Mau as well as if clusters (of powerlooms, resembling modern industry) are encouraged. But as of date only one cluster has been identified as Palki Industries Pvt. Ltd. with 4100 units as per MSME survey of 2012. Mau also contains three small industrial areas in Tajopur, Shahadatpura and Ghosi.

<doc id="548518" wikidata="Q7128429" url="?curid=548518" title="Palms, Los Angeles">
<text>Palms (originally &quot;The Palms&quot;) is a community in the Westside region of Los Angeles, California, founded in 1886 and the oldest neighborhood annexed to the city, in 1915. The 1886 tract was marketed as an agricultural and vacation community. Today it is a primarily residential area, with many apartment buildings, ribbons of commercial zoning and a single-family residential area in its northwest corner. As of the 2000 census the population of Palms was 42,545.

==History==
===Before 1887===
====Rancho La Ballona====
In Spanish and Mexican days, the area that later became Palms was a part of the Rancho La Ballona, where in 1819 Agustín and Ygnacio Machado, along with Felipe Talamantes and his son, Tomás, acquired grazing rights to of land. It was thenceforth used as grazing land for cattle and sheep. According to &quot;Culver City History,&quot; a 2001 work by Julie Lugo Cerra, published for the Culver City Unified School District:
The family lore relates that Agustín was chosen, by virtue of his skill as a horseman to ride his fastest steed, from dawn until dusk, beginning at the foot of the Playa del Rey hills to claim Rancho La Ballona, or Paso de las Carretas. It stretched to Pico Boulevard (abutting Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica) and to what we know as Ince Boulevard, where Rancho Rincón de los Bueyes began.

Agustin Machado died in 1865, the same year La Ballona School was constructed to serve all elementary-age children within the Ballona School District. In 1871, Ygnacio Saenz established a general store at the crossing which later became Washington Boulevard and Overland Avenue. (Three corners of that intersection are in Culver City and one is in Palms.) The store, which was also a way stop on the county road between Los Angeles and the ocean, also housed the area&#x27;s first post office.

By 1882, the county&#x27;s electoral district serving Palms was known as &quot;Ballona,&quot; with voting at La Ballona School.

====Land rush and land division====
Deke Keasbey, real estate investment specialist for Tierra Properties, has noted that:

The Southern Pacific completed its Los Angeles route in 1883, and only three years later the Santa Fe finished its Los Angeles spur. With a huge investment in their new coast-to-coast rail lines and large Los Angeles land holdings, the railroads set forth a long-term plan for growth. Southern California citrus farming was born. Tourism and the building of towns were promoted to attract investors, to raise land values, and to increase the value of railroad shipments

La Ballona Valley was part of that land rush. In 1882, several Midwestern families chartered a reconditioned freight car and left their homes in Le Mars, Iowa, to settle in the valley. They held their first Sunday school in the old La Ballona School on Washington Boulevard, and in fall 1883 they organized a United Brethren Church with 11 members.

About that time the valley drew the attention of three speculators – Joseph Curtis, Edward H. Sweetser and C.J. Harrison. They paid $40,000 for . They surveyed their land and cut it up, and then they sold it to the new arrivals. They planted 5,000 trees along eight miles (13 km) of graded streets. They named it The Palms, even though they had to bring in palm trees and plant them near the train station. Their first tract map was dated December 26, 1886, which is now considered the birth date of Palms. During this time, the Palms-Southern Pacific Railroad Depot was constructed, serving as one of only two depots between Los Angeles and Santa Monica. It was moved to the Heritage Square Museum in 1976.

The site was midway between Los Angeles and Santa Monica on the Los Angeles and Independence Railroad (now the E Line light rail line.). Before the massive urban growth engendered by the Los Angeles Aqueduct, Palms was located within a farming and ranching area.

===Since 1886===
The subdividers gave the United Brethren Church two lots and $200 in cash to get started. In 1887 the church building was completed, and in 1889 the parsonage was built. In 1908 the old chapel was moved to the rear of the lot and new sanctuary built. In 1916 the old parsonage sold and a new one built. Later a bungalow was added next door to be a Sunday school.

Although its exact location has been lost, contemporary sources indicate the existence of a Palms Villa, Palm Villa, or Villa Hotel at least from no later than 1890 through 1904. It may have stood on Tabor Street, which was known as Villa Avenue at the time.

====Annexation====

The residential development of a vast area west of the Los Angeles city limits brought a pressure for annexation to the city. Particularly noted was, first, the construction by L.A. of a new outfall sewer that could serve the area and, second, plans by the city engineer for a flood control project for the La Cienega region. Agitation for annexation was begun by Palms residents, but the reach was extended all the way west to the then-separate city of Sawtelle limits so that municipality could be annexed later.

There were two annexation elections. Both were hard fought. The first, on April 28, 1914, was voted down, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; &quot;because the people in the suburban territory are afraid of the municipal bond craze, of which the power scheme is the last straw, and the threatened burden of extra high taxation.&quot; The vote was 387 in favor and 264 against; a two-thirds vote was needed, so the &quot;yes&quot; vote was shy by 47.

A new petition was almost immediately submitted, leaving out all the areas that had voted against annexation. Nevertheless, Harry Culver, the founder of Culver City, denounced the new plan as a gerrymander and opposed it. But &quot;The Times&quot; wrote:

This district comprises some of the richest country between the city and the sea and is directly in the path of the residence expansion westward. Because its growth is inevitable and its population certain to be greatly increased soon, advocates of annexation believe the necessity for securing adequate and permanent water rights is urgent and are working diligently to secure the required two-thirds vote

On June 1, 1914, the annexation succeeded, by a 342–136 vote, and on May 4, 1915, Los Angeles voters approved the annexation of the Palms district, as well as that of the extensive San Fernando Valley. Both Palms and the Valley entered Los Angeles on May 22, 1915.

====Naming====
The &quot;Travelers&#x27; Handbook to Southern California,&quot; published in 1904, stated that &quot;The Palms&quot; was &quot;named from the number of large palms which dot the region for quite a distance near the Southern
Pacific depot&quot; and that &quot;The Los Angeles and Pacific road has [been] built via The Palms and Ocean Park to Santa Monica, making its line a belt of sixteen miles or more on each lap.&quot;

Over the decades following the turn of the 20th century, the definite article was dropped from the place name. By the 1920s, the name was simply &quot;Palms&quot; on local transit maps.

==Geography==
Palms has no official boundaries, but the &quot;Mapping L.A.&quot; reference guide of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; measures it at 1.95 square miles and places it northwest of Culver City, south of Cheviot Hills and Beverlywood, southeast of Rancho Park, west of Mid-City and northeast of Mar Vista. The 1886 subdivision map filed with Los Angeles County showed Palms as bounded on the northeast by what would today be Manning Avenue. When Palms was annexed to the city of Los Angeles in 1915, the bounds extended westward from Arlington Avenue on the southeast and about Rimpau Boulevard and Wilshire Boulevard on the northeast to Pico and Exposition Boulevards on the northwest. West of Overland Avenue wasn&#x27;t annexed until 1927.

The portion of Palms girded by Overland, Sepulveda, National, and Charnock Road was developed just before World War II as Westside Village. The City of Los Angeles has posted official neighborhood signs for Westside Village, and it has its own homeowners association: the Westside Village Homeowners Association.

The Palms Neighborhood Council boundaries were defined by the city to omit Westside Village (which had already been claimed by the Mar Vista Community Council) and the area north and east of National Boulevard, which went to the Westside Neighborhood Council. Petitions were passed in both districts for boundary adjustments.

==Population==
As of the 2000 census the population of Palms was 42,545, and the city estimated its population at 45,475 in 2008. With a population density of 21,983 people per square mile it is one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Palms is one of the most diverse neighborhoods in Los Angeles. Residents were 38.3% white, 20.2% Asian, 12.2% African-American, 23.4% Latino, and 5.9% from other races. The median household income was $50,684, about average for the city.

Almost half the residents (45.9%) had a four-year degree, which was a high figure compared to the city as a whole. The percentage of residents aged 19 to 34 was among the county&#x27;s highest.

In ancestry, Mexican (13.1%) and Irish (4.3%) were the most common, with about 40.4% being foreign born (average for the city). Mexico (17.3%) and Korea (5.9%) were the most common foreign places of birth.

==Housing==
Until the early 1960s, most of Palms was single-family homes and small duplexes and triplexes, most of which were built in the Craftsman and Spanish Colonial styles that dominated Southern California in the first quarter of the 20th century. Under pressure to provide affordable housing, the city of Los Angeles rezoned most of the district for large multifamily dwellings. This resulted in most of Palms&#x27; historic housing stock being razed and replaced with two-story (or larger) apartment buildings. Very few original houses remain, and many of those are on lots where additional housing units have been built on what were once backyards. Palms is now one of Los Angeles&#x27; most densely populated neighborhoods. The goal of the rezoning plan to provide affordable housing proved to be successful, as the neighborhood is now home to one of the largest concentrations of relatively low-cost rental units in Western Los Angeles. As of 2020, the median sales prices of single family homes in adjacent neighborhoods are all upwards of $1 million, while in Palms apartments can be found for as little as $1500 a month.

The housing stock in Palms is now almost completely composed of apartment buildings, and 92% of the population there are renters. In 2000, rentals in the entire Palms neighborhood amounted to 87% of occupied dwellings, compared to 13% of owner-occupied units. The upscale Westside Village district contains the only significant remaining concentration of owner-occupied single-family homes. While the neighborhood was largely constructed by developer Fritz Burns in assembly-line style just before World War II; most of these houses have been expanded or demolished in the ensuing decades, and the neighborhood today consists of a varied assortment of architectural styles with little resemblance to the original planned community. Apartment buildings, including two UCLA family- and graduate-student housing complexes, line Westside Village&#x27;s major thoroughfares. Many Palms residents work in adjacent Culver City, which is home to many large office and industrial complexes but has a relatively low population density. Despite being nearly five time larger in land area than Palms, Culver City has a slightly smaller total population.

==Transportation==
===Highway===
Palms is served by the 405 (San Diego) and the 10 (Santa Monica [Rosa Parks]) freeways.

===Rail===
Palms is served by the Metro E Line, reactivating Pacific Electric passenger service which had been in place from 1875 to 1953. Service restarted in 2012, with the western terminus located near the intersection of Venice and Robertson Boulevards. The line now runs between East Los Angeles and Santa Monica, with a stop at the Palms station, which opened on May 20, 2016.

=== Bicycling ===
Palms is considerably more bicycle-friendly than many other urban neighborhoods in Los Angeles, and bicycling is very popular owing to the neighborhoods density, young population, and scarcity of parking. Venice Boulevard and Motor Avenue, the two primary commercial corridors in the neighborhood, both feature dedicated bicycle lanes. The construction of the Metro E Line was accompanied by a Class A bicycle trail running adjacent to the tracks along Exposition Boulevard, the Expo Bike Path, which allows for easy bicycle access to the Palms station as well as being popular for recreational use by cyclists and joggers. This path was controversial, however, because of a large gap (stretching from Palms Boulevard to Overland Avenue) in the promised route following the E Line to connect to Santa Monica and the Pacific Ocean.

===LAnow===
Palms is served by LAnow a new on demand shared-ride service. Serve started in May 2019, users can reserve a ride through the LAnow smartphone app, online or by phone. Once reserved, users can meet the shuttle at the scheduled LAnow pick-up/drop-off point. Within the service area, pick-up/drop-off points are never more than a few blocks (1/4 mile) away.

==Landmarks and attractions==
Palms&#x27; diversity is reflected in its landmarks. Religious sites include the complexes of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness on Watseka Avenue and the Iranian-American Muslim Association of North America (IMAN) on Motor Avenue.

Palms has many Indonesian, Indian and Pakistani restaurants and businesses. In addition, it is also one of the centers of the Brazilian community in Los Angeles, with a number of Brazilian-oriented restaurants and shops, and one nightclub. In 1979 the original Chippendales erotic male dancing club at 3739 Overland Avenue at McCune Avenue was started by Bengali immigrant Steve Banerjee when he turned his nightclub-disco, Destiny II, into a venue for male strippers.

The area is host to an unusual museum, the Museum of Jurassic Technology, and a research institute, the Center for Land Use Interpretation. It has a legitimate theater, the Ivy Substation, which is now home to the Actors Gang, led by Tim Robbins. The Ivy Substation is within Media Park, which has been leased to Culver City on a long-term basis.

==Government and infrastructure==
===Neighborhood council===
Palms is served by a Los Angeles city-certified neighborhood council, whose governing body is called the Representative Assembly.

The council was certified as part of the city government on December 14, 2004. Its founding president was Len Nguyen, who resigned shortly after his taking office to work for newly elected City Council Member Bill Rosendahl. Todd Robinson succeeded as the second president, but he resigned a few months later. In March 2006 Vice President Pauline Stout moved up to become president. She was succeeded by George Garrigues (2008–09), Dee Olomajeye (2009–12), Eli Lipmen (2012–14), Marisa Stewart (2014–16), Nick Greif (2016–2018) and Alison Regan (2018–2019).

All of the stakeholders in Palms are members of the neighborhood council. Stakeholders include not only those who live, work, or own property in the district but also a broader category of people who can claim affiliation through some other kind of activity on behalf of Palms organizations. Three from that category were elected in spring 2005 to the Representative Assembly, a 13-member governing body composed of officers chosen on a district-wide basis and representatives elected from local areas.
Over the last decade, the Palms Neighborhood Council (PNC) has worked to:

* Improve the quality of life in Palms
* Give our neighborhood a voice on issues affecting the community
* Improve the delivery of City services to our area
* Make City officials and Departments more accountable to community needs and concerns
* Represent the diverse people of Palms; including renters, homeowners, employees, merchants, and others affiliated with local cultural, educational, and religious organizations

===Public safety===
The Los Angeles Fire Department operates Station 43, which also serves portions of Rancho Park and Cheviot Hills.

Los Angeles Police Department operates the Pacific Community Police Station at 12312 Culver Boulevard.

===County representation===
The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services SPA 5 West Area Health Office serves Palms.

===Post office===
The United States Postal Service Palms Post Office is located at 3751 Motor Avenue.

==Education==

Almost half of Palms residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, a high figure for both the city and the county. The percentages of residents of that age with a bachelor&#x27;s degree or a master&#x27;s degree were also considered high for the county.

The schools within Palms are as follows:

* Redeemer Baptist Elementary School, private, 10792 National Boulevard
* Clover Avenue Elementary School, LAUSD, 11020 Clover Avenue
* Le Lycée de Los Angeles, private, 3261 Overland Avenue
* Palms Elementary School, LAUSD, 3520 Motor Avenue
* Palms Middle School, LAUSD, 10680 Woodbine Street
* Magnolia Science Academy No. 6, charter, 3754 Dunn Drive
* Saint Augustine Elementary School, private, 3819 Clarington Avenue
* Charnock Road Elementary School, LAUSD, 11133 Charnock Road
* New World Montessori School, private K-6, 10520 Regent Street

Alexander Hamilton High School (Los Angeles), LAUSD, 2955 S. Robertson Boulevard serves Palms as its public high school.

==Parks and recreation==

Palms Park and Palms Recreation Center are in Palms. The recreation center has an auditorium, barbecue pits, lighted outdoor basketball courts, a children&#x27;s play room, a community room, and picnic tables. The Palms Park Child Care Center is adjacent to the park. Preschool is offered for children ages 3–5. The center has an enclosed play area.

Woodbine Park is also located in Palms. It is a small pocket park with picnic tables, a basketball court, and a children&#x27;s play area. It is this park where rapper Snoop Dogg was alleged to have been involved in the shooting death of gang member Philip Woldemariam.

<text>The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF; ) is an ocean current with importance for global climate as is the low-latitude movement of warm, relative freshwater from the north Pacific to the Indian Ocean. It thus serves as a main upper branch of the global heat/salt conveyor belt.

==Cause and effects==
The ocean surface of this part of the far western Pacific is on average each day higher than that in the adjacent part of the Indian Ocean. The difference drives upper thermocline water &quot;downhill&quot; through the deep, straight, westerly, north–south Makassar Strait then to meet the in reality combined Java Sea-Banda Sea. About 15% of this then exits directly through the very narrow Lombok Strait. Weaker flows of saltier and denser South Pacific slightly augment the Banda Sea via the Lifamatola Passage, both inflows mixing there due to its bounds and tides, Ekman pumping, and heat and freshwater flux. From this sea 85% of the ITF uses the broad Timor and narrow Ombai passage.

The location and topography of the channels that make up the ITF are shown inset. Lombok Strait is 300m deep and roughly 35 km wide and the currents vary between 0.286 m/s (0.6 mi/hr) eastward to 0.67 m/s westward and average 0.25 m/s westward. Currents in Ombai vary between 0.12 m/s eastward to 0.16 m/s westward, averaging 0.11 m/s westward and are funneled within the 1250m deep and 35 km wide passage. Timor passage, which is 1890 m deep by 160 km wide, is the widest of the exit pathways and averages only 0.02 m/s. From 2004 to 2006, 11 moorings were deployed across the entrance and exit regions of the ITF and were positioned to accurately measure each passage&#x27;s contribution as part of the International Nusantara Stratification and Transport (INSTANT) program. A study using Princeton Ocean Model has observed that the ITF has maximum volume transport from the Pacific Ocean to Indian Ocean through Savu strait (~6/5 Sv, 1 Sv = 106 m³/s), followed by Timor passage (~3.5/2 Sv) and Lombok strait (~2/1.75 Sv) thus the gross volume transport of ITF is ~10/9 Sv and also it is observed that the ITF increases the temperature of the Southern Indian Ocean while it has no significant effect on the sea surface salinity of Indian Ocean. Flow in through Makassar (11.6 Sv) and Lifamatola (1.1 Sv) sums to 12.7 Sv. Total outflow transport corresponds to 15.0 Sv (varying from 10.7 to 18.7 Sv) and is made up of Lombok (2.6 Sv), Ombai (4.9 Sv) and Timor (7.5 Sv) contributions. Heat Transport of the Indonesian Throughflow is 1.087 PW (1 PW=1015 Watt). Turbulence Kinetic Energy (TKE) of the ITF is of the order of 10−3 m2s−2 in the upper layer whereas it is 10−4 m2s−2 in the middle layer. Corresponding values of ITF TKE dissipation rate are of the order of 10−6 m2s−3 and 10−8 m2s−3 which indicate that this ITF archipelagoes region is a highly turbulent and a high heat dissipative in nature.

Circulation and transport within the Indonesian Seas vary along with large-scale monsoon flow. During June to August, southeasterlies of the southwest monsoon predominate over Indonesia and drive strong Ekman divergence (southwestward flow in the Southern Hemisphere thus increasing ITF to 15 Sv) whereas from December to February, Northwest Monsoon westerlies serve to directly reduce the ITF. During monsoon transitions, strong westerly winds in the eastern Indian Ocean force equatorial downwelling Kelvin waves (eastward moving, eastward flow) that propagate through the Indonesian passages as coastally trapped Kelvin waves and serve to reduce the ITF flow with a minimum in April of 9 Sv. Another way to think about it is that downwelling on the Indian Ocean side increases sea level and so reduces the normal Pacific-to-Indian pressure head reducing the flow.

Global-scale, ocean waves such as equatorial/coastal Kelvin and Rossby waves drive interannual variation of the ITF with an amplitude of roughly +/-3 Sv. Western-central Pacific westerly winds from El Nino force westward moving-equatorial Rossby waves and eastward currents that hit eastern New Guinea and propagate around the west coast as coastal Kelvin waves and down through the ITF along the west Australia Shelf coast serving to reduce the ITF. Upwelling (i.e. reduced sea level) associated with Rossby waves on the Pacific side reduces the Pacific-to-Indian pressure gradient and reduces the ITF. Interannual variability of Indian Ocean westerlies acts in the same manner as the seasonal equatorial Kelvin waves to reduce the normal westward ITF flow as well.

An important feature of the Indonesian Throughflow is that because the water in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean has a higher temperature and lower salinity than the water in the Indian Ocean, the Throughflow transports large amounts of relatively warm and fresh water to the Indian Ocean. When the Indonesian Throughflow (through Lombok Strait, Ombai and the Timor Passages) enters the Indian Ocean it is advected towards Africa within the Indian South Equatorial Current. There it eventually exits the Indian Ocean with the Agulhas Current around South Africa into the Atlantic Ocean. So the Indonesian Throughflow transports a significant amount of Pacific Ocean heat into the southwest Indian Ocean, which is approximately away from the Lombok Strait.

<doc id="548527" wikidata="Q596117" url="?curid=548527" title="Wumpscut">
<text>Wumpscut (stylised as :wumpscut: or simply :w:) is a gothic-influenced electro-industrial music project from Germany. It was founded in May 1991 by Bavarian disc jockey Rudolf &quot;Rudy&quot; Ratzinger (born 1966).

== History ==
Rudy Ratzinger is the creative force behind Wumpscut, occasionally employing the help of guest artists (such as Aleta Welling, P·A·L, Selene etc.), although such collaborations were minimal in scope. Ratzinger cites the influence of such bands as Leæther Strip as his reason for making the transfer from DJing to recording music: &quot;I was a DJ for several years and was tired of offering the audience only alien stuff. The first Leæther Strip works were responsible for trying something on my own.&quot;

First works performed by Wumpscut dates back to the early 1990s when Rudy Ratzinger started to play music in Bavarian club houses and in Southern Germany. In a 1997 interview, Rudy Ratzinger reveals that &quot;Pornography&quot; and &quot;War Combattery&quot; were his first two songs in EBM, those two four-minute songs are to be found on &quot;Defcon&quot;, the first demo issued by Wumpscut in late 1991. Yet, only &quot;Pornography&quot; was picked for reappearance on &quot;Blutkind&quot; (although a remix of War Combattery surfaced on the Mesner Tracks re-release EP which was released before). According to Rudy, &quot;War Combattery&quot; was a great hit in club houses: &quot;[It] was a very big success in the clubs in Southern Germany.&quot;
The release of the song &quot;Soylent Green&quot;, which is named after the 1973 movie and also contains audio samples from the German dubbed version, first attracted attention to Wumpscut. Since its release in 1993, it has become a frequently played song at events and clubs in the goth and industrial subcultures, in Germany, UK and the United States. The 1997 album, &quot;Embryodead&quot; made an appearance at #20 on the CMJ RPM chart in the U.S.

Wumpscut produced elaborate box set releases including limited versions of CD or LP releases with additional and bonus material (bonus tracks, &quot;liquid soylent&quot; energy drinks, posters, pins, stickers, bags, flags, etc.). Wumpscut albums were reissued with variant artworks, remastering and track listings. Standalone merchandise such as baseball caps, coffee mugs and t-shirts were also made available for purchase.

Rudy Ratzinger has to date released seventeen studio albums plus a number of compilations: demos, compilation tracks, and remixes from deleted singles and EPs. The sixteenth Wumpscut album, Wüterich, was released on 25 March 2016 on the Metropolis label. He released a &quot;best of&quot; album titled Innerfire on 5 May 2017, while also announcing that Wumpscut would no longer be producing or making any new music on his Facebook and Twitter accounts.

On 5 November 2020, a new album entitled &quot;Fledermavs 303&quot; was announced with the release of a teaser track through the Wumpscut page on Bandcamp, presumably implying that Rudy has returned to producing music again.

On 2 April 2021, a new album entitled &quot;Fledermavs 303&quot; was released.

== Record labels ==
Ratzinger started his own record label, Beton Kopf Media, in 1995, used exclusively to release Wumpscut material to the European market. In 1996, he started the label Mental Ulcer Forges which lapsed in the early 2000s, then relaunched in 2006. The label released albums by the following bands: Remyl, Noisex, B-Ton-K, Yendri and F/A/V. Rudy also managed the label Fleisskoma with Karl Kimmerl (B-Ton-K), which has released work by the electronic band Press to Transmit.

== Live performance ==
Despite the project&#x27;s popularity in the electro-industrial genre, Wumpscut is a studio-only project and never tours. When asked for his reason behind this decision, Rudy commented: &quot;I cannot come up to my self-set level.&quot;

<text>Lopez Island is the third largest of the San Juan Islands and an unincorporated town in San Juan County, Washington, United States. Lopez Island is in land area. The 2020 census population was 3,156, though the population swells in the summer, as second homes, rental houses, and campsites fill up.

==History==
The ancestors of today&#x27;s Northern Straits Coast Salish people began to appear in the wake of the continental ice sheet that started to recede 11,000 years ago. Archaeological evidence suggests that the island supported hunting and gathering between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago. The marine culture encountered by the first Europeans to the area developed about 2,500 years ago, and traces of its once thriving villages remain in the shell middens found along the shoreline of American and English camps and throughout the San Juan islands.

During the Wilkes Expedition, Lopez Island was given the name &quot;Chauncey Island&quot;, after the American naval commander Isaac Chauncey. When the British reorganized the official admiralty naval charts in 1847, Henry Kellett systematically removed many of Wilkes&#x27;s names. He renamed the island Lopez, for Gonzalo López de Haro, the Spanish naval officer who was the first European to sail to the San Juan Islands archipelago.

The Lopez Island Historical Museum collects and preserves the regional history of Lopez and the San Juan Islands. The museum features artifacts reflecting Lopez&#x27;s contributions to the maritime, fishing and farming industries. The museum has an extensive archive of local historical documents as well as artifacts depicting life on Lopez Island in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

== Demographics ==

=== 2010 Census ===
As of the 2010 census, there were 2,383 people, 1,204 households, and 719 families residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 93.6% White, 0.3% African American, 0.9% Native American, 1.2% Asian, 1.2% from other races, and 2.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.6% of the population.

There were 1,204 households, of which 14% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 52% were married couples living together, 4.7% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.0% had a male householder with no wife present, and 40.3% were non-families. 33.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.97 and the average family size was 2.45.

The median age in the city was 56.9 years. 12.9% of residents were under the age of 18; 8.6%, 28.7% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 49.5% male and 50.5% female.

==Geography==

Lopez Island is flatter than most of the other major San Juan Islands. It is also the most rural of the larger islands, and has rolling terrain of forest, farmland, and beaches. The island is longest in the north–south direction.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6 °F. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Lopez Island has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

==Transportation==
There are no highways on Lopez Island, and no bridges connecting to the mainland or other islands. The primary means of travel to and from Lopez Island is by ferry. The ferry terminal is located at the extreme north end of the island. It is the first stop of four on the Washington State Ferries’ San Juan Islands run. A typical sailing from Anacortes takes approximately 40 minutes.

Lopez Island Airport is the main airstrip for the island, located on its west side, offering daily commercial flights. Charter floatplanes land in Fisherman Bay at Fisherman Bay Seaplane Base, located approximately three-fourths mile north of the airport. A small private airstrip called Windsock Airport is located less than one and a half miles from the ferry terminal.

==Economy and tourism==
Lopez is home to a large number of tourist-related businesses, largely country-style bed and breakfasts and rental houses, many with ocean views. There is a vineyard, one hotel and resort, two public marinas, several restaurants and cafes, a Zagat-rated gourmet restaurant, a small bookstore, and two coffee shops. The summer months&#x27; Saturday Market in Lopez Village is filled with arts and crafts, local farm produce, and community activities.

Lopez Island is a popular destination for bicycle tourists. Bicyclists are advised to avoid Center Road, which is not as wide as other island roads. But overall, the drivers are bicycle-friendly and the roads are easier to ride than those on the other San Juan Islands with lower speed limits.

The island is known for the longstanding custom of waving at every motorist, bicyclist, or pedestrian encountered on the island&#x27;s roads.
In 1996 Paul Allen bought a large Sperry Peninsula site on Lopez Island. The purchase displaced Camp Nor&#x27;wester, a summer camp for local children that had been running for 50 years.

== Parks ==
Lopez Island is home to several parks that vary in purpose and geography. Agate Beach County Park, Odlin County Park, and Otis Perkins Day Parks are beach recreation areas and offer picnic amenities. Agate is located on the south end of the island. Odlin, one of the most popular beaches on the island, resides just south of Ferry Landing and offers sites for camping and has a boat launch. The beach at the Otis Perkins day use area is considered as one of the longest beaches in the San Juan Islands.

Two parks offer short hikes. Shark Reef Park offers long views west over San Juan Channel and it includes a half-mile trail through some old-growth trees. Upright Channel Park, a state-operated facility, offers several picnic sites and a hike down to a sandy beach.

The largest park on the island is Spencer Spit State Park. The focus of the park, located on the northeast side of the island, is a long, low sandspit that almost connects to small Frost Island just offshore. This 130 acre (53 ha) park has a camping area, picnic sites, and mooring buoys for boats.

<text>Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) is a Microsoft name resolution service, introduced in 1994 with Windows NT 3.5, for translating NetBIOS names to IP addresses. NetBIOS names are an older naming convention used for local name resolution before DNS became ubiquitous. WINS is mostly unnecessary for modern networks unless legacy systems require it. The rise of DNS, especially through Microsoft&#x27;s Active Directory service&#x27;s DNS support, made WINS effectively obsolete by the mid-2000s. Microsoft documentation advises not to use WINS on networks not requiring it.

==Details==
WINS is Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of the NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS), a name server and service for NetBIOS computer names. Effectively, WINS is to NetBIOS names what DNS is to domain names — a central mapping of host names to network addresses. Like the DNS, it is implemented in two parts, a server service (that manages the embedded Jet Database, server to server replication, service requests, and conflicts) and a TCP/IP client component which manages the client&#x27;s registration and renewal of names, and takes care of queries.

<doc id="548536" wikidata="Q821711" url="?curid=548536" title="Plague of Justinian">
<text>The plague of Justinian or Justinianic plague (AD 541–549) was an epidemic that afflicted the entire Mediterranean Basin, Europe, and the Near East, severely affecting the Sasanian Empire and the Byzantine Empire, especially Constantinople. The plague is named for the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) who, according to his court historian Procopius, contracted the disease and recovered in 542, at the height of the epidemic which killed about a fifth of the population in the imperial capital. The contagion arrived in Roman Egypt in 541, spread around the Mediterranean Sea until 544, and persisted in Northern Europe and the Arabian Peninsula until 549. By 543, the plague had spread to every corner of the empire. As the first episode of the first plague pandemic, it had profound economic, social, and political effects across Europe and the Near East and cultural and religious impact on Eastern Roman society. 

In 2013, researchers confirmed earlier speculation that the cause of the plague of Justinian was &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, the same bacterium responsible for the Black Death (1346–1353). Ancient and modern &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; strains are closely related to the ancestor of the Justinian plague strain that has been found in the Tian Shan, a system of mountain ranges on the borders of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and China, suggesting that the Justinian plague originated in or near that region. However, there would appear to be no mention of bubonic plague in China until the year 610.

== History ==
The Byzantine historian Procopius first reported the epidemic in 541 from the port of Pelusium, near Suez in Egypt. Two other first hand reports of the plague&#x27;s ravages were by the Syriac church historian John of Ephesus and Evagrius Scholasticus, who was a child in Antioch at the time and later became a church historian. Evagrius was afflicted with the buboes associated with the disease, but survived. During the disease&#x27;s four returns in his lifetime, he lost his wife, a daughter and her child, other children, most of his servants, and people from his country estate.

According to contemporary sources, the outbreak in Constantinople was thought to have been carried to the city by infected rats on grain ships arriving from Egypt. To feed its citizens, the city and outlying communities imported large amounts of grain, mostly from Egypt. The rat population in Egypt thrived on feeding from the large granaries maintained by the government, and fleas thrived as well.

Procopius, in a passage closely modelled on Thucydides, recorded that at its peak the plague was killing 10,000 people in Constantinople daily, but the accuracy of the figure is in question, and the true number will probably never be known. He noted that because there was no room to bury the dead, bodies were left stacked in the open. Funeral rites were often left unattended to, and the entire city smelled like the dead. Given such circumstances, it is highly probable that a sudden increase in mortality rates may not have been as accurately recorded, hence why the overall death toll is based on an estimate.

In Procopius&#x27; &quot;Secret History,&quot; he records the devastation in the countryside and reports the ruthless response by the hard-pressed Justinian:

When pestilence swept through the whole known world and notably the Roman Empire, wiping out most of the farming community and of necessity leaving a trail of desolation in its wake, Justinian showed no mercy towards the ruined freeholders. Even then, he did not refrain from demanding the annual tax, not only the amount at which he assessed each individual, but also the amount for which his deceased neighbors were liable. 

As a result of the plague in the countryside, farmers could not take care of crops and the price of grain rose in Constantinople. Justinian had expended huge amounts of money for wars against the Vandals in the region of Carthage and the Ostrogoths&#x27; kingdom in Italy. He had invested heavily in the construction of great churches, such as Hagia Sophia. As the empire tried to fund the projects, the plague caused tax revenues to decline through the massive number of deaths and the disruption of agriculture and trade. Justinian swiftly enacted new legislation to deal more efficiently with the glut of inheritance suits being brought as a result of victims dying intestate.

The plague&#x27;s long-term effects on European and Christian history were enormous. As the disease spread to port cities around the Mediterranean, the struggling Goths were reinvigorated and their conflict with Constantinople entered a new phase. The plague weakened the Byzantine Empire at a critical point, when Justinian&#x27;s armies had nearly retaken all of Italy and the western Mediterranean coast; the evolving conquest would have reunited the core of the Western Roman Empire with the Eastern Roman Empire. Although the conquest occurred in 554, the reunification did not last long. In 568, the Lombards invaded Northern Italy, defeated the small Byzantine army that had been left behind and established the Kingdom of the Lombards.

Gaul is known to have suffered severely from the plague, and plague victims at an early Anglo-Saxon burial site at Edix Hill near Cambridge show that it also reached Britain.

Procopius said that plague sufferers experienced delusions, nightmares, fevers, swellings in the groin, armpits and behind the ears, and coma or death. Treatments included cold baths, powders &quot;blessed&quot; by saints, magic amulets or rings, and various drugs, especially alkaloids. When these treatments failed, people went to hospitals or tried to quarantine themselves.

===Onset of the first plague pandemic===

The Plague of Justinian is the first and the best known outbreak of the first plague pandemic, which continued to recur until the middle of the 8th century. Some historians believe the first plague pandemic was one of the deadliest pandemics in history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 15–100 million people during two centuries of recurrence, a death toll equivalent to 25–60% of Europe&#x27;s population at the time of the first outbreak. Research published in 2019 argued that the 200-year-long pandemic&#x27;s death toll and social effects have been exaggerated, comparing it to the modern third plague pandemic (1855–1960s). Furthermore, historians seek to play down the effects of the late-antique bubonic plague, arguing that our eyewitness accounts of the disease are hysterical in tone and misleading in effect.

== Epidemiology ==

=== Genetics of the Justinian plague strain ===
The plague of Justinian is generally regarded as the first historically recorded epidemic of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;. This conclusion is based on historical descriptions of the clinical manifestations of the disease and the detection of &quot;Y. pestis&quot; DNA from human remains at ancient grave sites dated to that period.

Genetic studies of modern and ancient &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; DNA suggest that the origin of the Justinian plague was in Central Asia. The most basal, or root level, existing strains of the &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; as a whole species are found in Qinghai, China. Other scholars contest that, rather than Central Asia, the specific strain that composed the Justinian plague began in sub-Saharan Africa, and that the plague was spread to the Mediterranean by merchants from the Kingdom of Aksum in East Africa. This point of origin aligns more with the general south–north spread of the disease from Egypt into the rest of the Mediterranean world. It also explains why Sassanid Persia saw a later development of the outbreak despite stronger trade links with Central Asia. After samples of DNA from &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; were isolated from skeletons of Justinian plague victims in Germany, it was found that modern strains currently found in the Tian Shan mountain range system are most basal known in comparison with the Justinian plague strain. Additionally, a skeleton found in Tian Shan dating to around 180 AD and identified as an &quot;early Hun&quot; was found to contain DNA from &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; closely related to the Tian Shan strain basal ancestor of the Justinian plague strain German samples. This finding suggests that the expansion of nomadic peoples who moved across the Eurasian steppe, such as the Xiongnu and the later Huns, had a role in spreading plague to West Eurasia from an origin in Central Asia.

Earlier samples of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; DNA have been found in skeletons dating from 3000 to 800 BC, across West and East Eurasia. The strain of &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; responsible for the Black Death, the devastating pandemic of bubonic plague, does not appear to be a direct descendant of the Justinian plague strain. However, the spread of Justinian plague may have caused the evolutionary radiation that gave rise to the currently extant 0ANT.1 clade of strains.

=== Virulence and mortality rate ===
The number of deaths is uncertain. Some modern scholars believe that the plague killed up to 5,000 people per day in Constantinople at the peak of the pandemic. According to one view, the initial plague ultimately killed perhaps 40% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants and caused the deaths of up to a quarter of the human population of the Eastern Mediterranean. Frequent subsequent waves of the plague continued to strike throughout the 6th, 7th and 8th centuries, with the disease becoming more localized and less virulent.

A revisionist view expressed by scholars, such as Lee Mordechai and Merle Eisenberg, argues that the mortality of the Justinian Plague was far lower than previously believed. They say that the plague might have caused high mortality in specific places, but it did not cause widespread demographic decline or decimate Mediterranean populations. According to them, any direct mid-to-long term effects of plague were minor. However, their position has been the subject of a concerted critique by Peter Sarris, who challenged both their core methodology and their handling of the sources. Sarris also provides up-to-date discussion of the genetic evidence, including the suggestion that the plague may have entered Western Eurasia via more than one route, and perhaps struck England before Constantinople.

== Climate connections ==

According to 2024 research, major plagues that significantly impacted the Roman Empire, such as the Antonine Plague, the Plague of Cyprian, and the Plague of Justinian, are strongly linked to periods of cooler and drier climate conditions, indicating that colder weather may have contributed to the spread of these diseases during that time. It is thought climate stress interacted with social and biological variables, such as food availability, rodent populations, and human migration, making populations more susceptible to disease.

<doc id="548537" wikidata="Q750005" url="?curid=548537" title="Aston Martin Lagonda">
<text>The Aston Martin Lagonda is a full-size luxury four-door saloon manufactured by British manufacturer Aston Martin between 1974 and 1990. A total of 645 were produced. The name was derived from the Lagonda marque that Aston Martin had purchased in 1947. There are two distinct generations: the original, the short-lived 1974 design based on a lengthened Aston Martin V8, and the entirely redesigned, wedge-shaped Series 2 model introduced in 1976.

In 2014, Aston Martin confirmed it would launch a new Lagonda model called the Taraf for the Middle-East market, sold on an invitation-only basis as a successor to this saloon. As of 2022, 113 remain registered in the United Kingdom, though 82 are SORN (unregistered for routine road use).

==History==
Aston Martin was facing financial pressure in the mid-1970s and needed something to bring in some much-needed funds. Traditionally Aston Martin had worked on 2+2 sports cars but the Lagonda was a four-door saloon. As soon as it was introduced, it attracted hundreds of deposits and boosted Aston Martin&#x27;s cash reserves.
After the production of seven Series 1 cars, the Lagonda was designed from the ground up in 1976 by William Towns as an extreme interpretation of the classic 1970s &quot;folded paper&quot; style. It was an unconventional design practice for the company. With famous contemporaries like the Lamborghini Countach, Lotus Esprit, and DMC DeLorean, the Lagonda is frequently named among the most striking wedge-shaped designs. The Lagonda combined striking styling with a premium leather interior and (for the day), advanced instrumentation. Coupled to a Chrysler three-speed &quot;TorqueFlite&quot; automatic transmission, its four-cam carbureted V8 provided poor fuel economy, affected little by the change to fuel injection in the Series 3.

Throughout the history of the marque, the hand-built Lagonda was amongst the most expensive luxury saloons in the world. The only other production cars to approach its price were the Rolls-Royce Silver Spirit/Silver Spur and the Bentley Mulsanne.

The Lagonda was the first production car to use a digital instrument panel. The development cost for the electronics alone on the Lagonda came to four times as much as the budget for the whole car. The Series 3 used cathode-ray tubes for the instrumentation, which proved even less reliable than the original model&#x27;s light-emitting diode (LED) display.

It was named by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; as one of the 50 ugliest cars of the last 50 years and &quot;Time&quot; magazine included it in its &quot;50 Worst Cars of All Time&quot;, describing it as a mechanical &quot;catastrophe&quot; with electronics that would be impressive if they ever worked.

==Models==
A number of iterations of the Lagonda were produced: the original Series 1 and the wedge-shaped Series 2, 3, and 4. A total of 645 cars were produced in its 12-year production run.

===Series 1 (1974–1975)===

This long-wheelbase, four-door version of the Aston Martin V8 was announced at the 1974 London Motor Show. Designed by William Towns and based on the DBS, it was the first car to wear the Lagonda name since the 1961 Rapide. The 5.3 L V8 engine was supplied with either a 5-speed manual or automatic transmission. Only seven were sold.

====Specifications (Series 1)====
* Engine and power output: 5.3-L DOHC V8, , of torque
* Top speed: 
*0–97 km/h (0–60 mph): 6.2 seconds
* Length: 
* Wheelbase: 
* Width: 
* Height: 
* Weight: 

At least two of the cars (having chassis numbers 12003 and 12005) have been upgraded by R.S. Williams Ltd of Cobham to a 7.0-litre version of the original engine, able to generate a power output ranging from on unleaded fuel.

===Series 2 (1976–1985)===

The wedge-shaped Lagonda V8 saloon was launched in 1976 at the London Motor Show and was a total contrast to the 1974 model, sharing little but the engine. Deliveries of the Lagonda did not commence until 1979. Series 2 cars were originally fitted with digital LCD dashboards and touch button controls but these features were abandoned in 1980. The Lagonda retailed at £49,933 in 1980, significantly more than a Ferrari 400 or Maserati Kyalami but less than a Rolls-Royce Corniche. The car commenced sales in the US from 1982 with minor regulatory amendments to the front bumper and airdam.

====Specification (Series 2)====
* Engine and power output: 5.3 L DOHC V8, at 5,000 rpm, of torque at 3,000 rpm
* Top speed: 
*0–97 km/h (0–60 mph): 8.8 seconds
* Length: 
* Wheelbase: 
* Width: 
* Height: 
* Weight: 

===Series 3 (1986–1987)===
The Series 3 was produced for only one year with 75 units manufactured. All had fuel injected engines. Cathode-ray tube instrumentation was later changed to a vacuum fluorescent display system and shared exterior styling with the Series 2.

===Series 4 (1987–1990)===
The Series 4 was launched at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1987, having been extensively restyled by the car&#x27;s original designer William Towns. Sharp edges were rounded off and the pop-up headlights were replaced with three headlights on each side of the grille. The side swage line (or character line) was removed and 16-inch wheels were introduced. With production of around one car per week, 105 cars were manufactured through January 1990. 72 of the Series 4 cars were built with left-hand drive.

===Special variants===

Aftermarket variations of the Lagonda included:

* Tickford Lagonda (1983) – Five Series 2 Lagondas were sold with a bodykit and upgraded interiors.
* Tickford limousine (1984) – Four long-wheelbase Lagondas were made, at a cost of £110,000 each. On these cars, the rear door window glass was split vertically in half.
* Rapide (a two-door, short-wheelbase version) – one made with the front triple headlight design of the Series 4. 
* Shooting-brake (Estate) by Swiss company Roos Engineering – one made in 1998 using a 1987 model.
* Lagonda Vantage – a 1985 Lagonda with Vantage engine for an Indian Londoner.

<doc id="548540" wikidata="Q270800" url="?curid=548540" title="Gaston Bachelard">
<text>Gaston Bachelard (; ; 27 June 1884 – 16 October 1962) was a French philosopher. He made contributions in the fields of poetics and the philosophy of science. To the latter, he introduced the concepts of &quot;epistemological obstacle&quot; and &quot;epistemological break&quot; (&quot;obstacle épistémologique&quot; and &quot;rupture épistémologique&quot;). He influenced many subsequent French philosophers, among them Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Dominique Lecourt and Jacques Derrida, as well as the sociologists Pierre Bourdieu and Bruno Latour.

For Bachelard, the scientific object should be constructed and therefore different from the positivist sciences; in other words, information is in continuous construction. Empiricism and rationalism are not regarded as dualism or opposition but complementary, therefore studies of a priori and a posteriori, or in other words reason and dialectic, are part of scientific research.

==Early life and education==

Bachelard was born in Bar-sur-Aube, France in 1884.

He was a postal clerk in Bar-sur-Aube, and then studied physics and chemistry before finally becoming interested in philosophy. To obtain his doctorate (&quot;doctorat ès lettres&quot;) in 1927, he wrote two theses: the main one, &quot;Essai sur la connaissance approchée&quot;, under the direction of Abel Rey, and the complementary one, &quot;Étude sur l&#x27;évolution d&#x27;un problème de physique: la propagation thermique dans les solides&quot;, supervised by Léon Brunschvicg.

==Career==

He first taught from 1902 to 1903 at the college of Sézanne, but turned away from teaching to consider a career in telegraphy. Literary by training, he took the technological path before moving towards science and mathematics. In particular, he was fascinated by the great discoveries of the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century (radioactivity, quantum and wave mechanics, relativity, electromagnetism and wireless telegraphy).

Discharged in March 1919 and unemployed, Bachelard searched and obtained a job in October as a professor of physics and chemistry at the college of Bar-sur-Aube.

At the age of thirty-six he began a completely unexpected philosophical career. Starting decisively in 1922, he acquired the title of Doctor of Letters at the Sorbonne in 1927. His theses, supported by Abel Rey and Léon Brunschvicg, were published. He became a lecturer at the Faculty of Letters of Dijon from October 1927, but remained at the college of Bar-sur-Aube until 1930. He even participated in the municipal elections of 1929 to defend the project of a college for all. He nevertheless accepted a professorship at the University of Burgundy when his daughter Suzanne entered the second degree.

From 1930 to 1940 he was a professor at the University of Dijon and then was appointed chair in the history and philosophy of science at the University of Paris. On 25 August 1937 he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor. He became a professor at the Sorbonne from 1940 to 1954. He held the chair of the history and philosophy of science, where he succeeded Abel Rey, director of the Institute of History and Philosophy of Science and Technology (IHST), which in 1992 became IHPST.
When he was appointed to the Sorbonne as a university professor and director of the Institute for the History of Science and Technology in 1940, he accompanied his daughter in her higher educations.

In 1958, he became a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.

==Personal life and death==
Bachelard married Jeanne Rossi, a schoolteacher, in 1914. She was transferred to Voigny. His daughter Suzanne was born on 18 October. He travelled the six kilometers to Bar-sur-Aube on foot every day, was provided a very useful education, and enrolled for a philosophy degree. Jeanne died in June 1920, and Bachelard raised his daughter alone. Despite the gender role expectations at the time, Bachelard showed great concern in supporting his daughter&#x27;s development into an academic career. Counter to stereotypes, he wanted to make his daughter, Suzanne, a scholar. Suzanne became a mathematician and philosopher involved in phenomenological and epistemological research of high standing.

In 1962, he died in Paris.
==Work==
=== Psychology of Science ===
Bachelard&#x27;s studies of the history and philosophy of science in such works as &quot;Le nouvel esprit scientifique&quot; (&quot;The New Scientific Spirit&quot;, 1934) and &quot;La formation de l&#x27;esprit scientifique&quot; (&quot;The Formation of the Scientific Mind&quot;, 1938) were based on his vision of historical epistemology as a kind of psychoanalysis of the scientific mind.

In the English-speaking world, the connection Bachelard made between psychology and the history of science has been little understood. Bachelard demonstrated how the progress of science could be blocked by certain types of mental patterns, creating the concept of &quot;obstacle épistémologique&quot; (&quot;epistemological obstacle&quot;). One task of epistemology is to make clear the mental patterns at use in science, in order to help scientists overcome the obstacles to knowledge. Another goal is to “give back to human reason its function of agitation and aggressiveness” as Bachelard put it in ‘L&#x27;engagement rationaliste’ (1972).

=== Epistemological breaks: the discontinuity of scientific progress ===
Bachelard was critical of Auguste Comte&#x27;s positivism, which considered science as a continual progress. To Bachelard, scientific developments such as Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity demonstrated the discontinuous nature of the history of sciences. Thus models that framed scientific development as continuous, such as that of Comte and Émile Meyerson, seemed simplistic and erroneous to Bachelard.

Through his concept of &quot;epistemological break&quot;, Bachelard underlined the discontinuity at work in the history of sciences. However the term &quot;epistemological break&quot; itself is almost never used by Bachelard but became famous through Louis Althusser.

He showed that new theories integrated old theories in new paradigms, changing the sense of concepts (for instance, the concept of mass, used by Newton and Einstein in two different senses). Thus, non-Euclidean geometry did not contradict Euclidean geometry, but integrated it into a larger framework.

=== Shifts in scientific perspective ===
Bachelard never saw how seemingly irrational theories often simply represented a drastic shift in scientific perspective. For instance, he never claimed that the theory of probabilities was just another way of complexifying reality through a deepening of rationality (even though critics like Lord Kelvin found this theory irrational).

One of his main theses in &quot;The New Scientific Mind&quot; was that modern sciences had replaced the classical ontology of the substance with an &quot;ontology of relations&quot;, which could be assimilated to something like a process philosophy. For instance, the physical concepts of matter and rays correspond, according to him, to the metaphysical concepts of the thing and of movement; but whereas classical philosophy considered both as distinct, and the thing as ontologically real, modern science can not distinguish matter from rays. It is thus impossible to examine an immobile thing, which was precisely the condition for knowledge according to the classical theory of knowledge (Becoming being impossible to be known, in accordance with Aristotle and Plato&#x27;s theories of knowledge).

In non-Cartesian epistemology, there is no &quot;simple substance&quot; as in Cartesianism, but only complex objects built by theories and experiments and continuously improved (VI, 4). Intuition is therefore not primitive, but built (VI, 2). These themes led Bachelard to support a sort of constructivist epistemology.

Bachelard was a rationalist in the Cartesian sense, although he recommended his &quot;non-Cartesian epistemology&quot; as a replacement for the more standard Cartesian epistemology. He compared &quot;scientific knowledge&quot; to ordinary knowledge in the way we deal with it, and saw error as only illusion: &quot;Scientifically, one thinks truth as the historical rectification of a persistent error, and experiments as correctives for an initial, common illusion (&quot;illusion première&quot;).&quot;

The role of epistemology is to show the history of the (scientific) production of concepts. Those concepts are not just theoretical propositions: they are simultaneously abstract and concrete, pervading technical and pedagogical activity. This explains why &quot;The electric bulb is an object of scientific thought… an example of an abstract-concrete object.&quot; To understand the way it works, one has to take the detour of scientific knowledge. Epistemology is thus not a general philosophy that aims at justifying scientific reasoning. Instead, it produces regional histories of science.

In addition to epistemology, Bachelard&#x27;s work deals with many other topics, including poetry, dreams, psychoanalysis, and the imagination. &quot;The Psychoanalysis of Fire&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Poetics of Space&quot; (1958) are among the most popular of his works: Jean-Paul Sartre cites the former and Bachelard&#x27;s &quot;Water and Dreams&quot; in his &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; (1943), and the latter had a wide reception in architectural theory circles, and continues to be influential in literary theory and creative writing. In philosophy, this nocturnal side of his work is developed by his student Gilbert Durand.

<doc id="548548" wikidata="Q207186" url="?curid=548548" title="Zlatko Zahovič">
<text>Zlatko Zahovič (; born 1 February 1971) is a Slovenian former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.

After making a name for himself in Portugal, most notably with Porto and Benfica where he amassed Primeira Liga totals of 246 matches and 54 goals over one full decade, he went on to have brief stints in Spain and Greece. He was known for dribbling and goal-scoring ability alike. Although primarily a midfielder, he scored 11 goals in 32 Champions League appearances and 35 in 80 for the Slovenian national team.

The all-time record holder in goals for Slovenia, Zahovič was an essential member of the squad as they qualified for the first time ever to a European Championship and a World Cup, in the early 2000s.

==Club career==
===Partizan===
Zahovič was born in Maribor, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 1989, the 18-year-old Kovinar Maribor player was noticed by Partizan&#x27;s Milko Ǵurovski, at the time doing his mandatory military service in the town, who recommended the youngster to the club.

With the Belgrade team, he was relatively used over the course of three seasons, and also played on loan for Mladost Petrinja and Proleter Zrenjanin. For Partizan, he made 15 appearances and scored three goals during the 1992–93 league season as they won the national championship.

===Portugal===
In the summer of 1993, aged 22, Zahovič moved to Portugal and joined Vitória de Guimarães. On matchday 32 of the 1995–96 campaign, he scored the winning goal in a 3–2 away win over FC Porto. This performance convinced the former to sign him that summer, after an acrimonious transfer saga; he led his side to two UEFA Cup qualifications during his three-year spell.

Zahovič was equally important while at Porto, forming a formidable attacking partnership with Capucho, Ljubinko Drulović and Mário Jardel and winning three consecutive league titles whilst rarely missing a match. In his last year he netted a career-best goals, and 22 across all competitions. He added seven during the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League, thus finishing third in the competition&#x27;s scoring charts behind FC Dynamo Kyiv&#x27;s Andriy Shevchenko and Dwight Yorke of Manchester United, who both scored eight – the northerners, however, did not make it past the group stage.

===Olympiacos===
In 1999, Zahovič signed for Olympiacos F.C. for a transfer fee of €13.5 million, at the time the highest sum ever paid for a Slovenian footballer. However, his season in Greece was marred by fines and suspension. Zahovič first fell out with the club&#x27;s head coach, Dušan Bajević, for returning late from a holiday.
In November 1999, as Olympiacos failed to progress out of the UEFA Champions League group stage, head coach Bajević was sacked and replaced with Alberto Bigon. Zahovič&#x27;s relationship with the incoming head coach was similarly fraught, as the player questioned the coach&#x27;s tactics.

Years later, Zahovič claimed in interviews that the real reason for his contentious season at Olympiacos was the club&#x27;s continual refusal to properly set up his legal and administrative status in Greece as a professional athlete. He further accused the club of using the administrative matters as leverage when trying to avoid honouring his contract terms pertaining to income tax on his salary.

===Valencia===
After only one season, Zahovič moved to Spain&#x27;s Valencia CF for a fee of £5.5 million. His new team reached the final of the 2000–01 Champions League, lost after a penalty shootout against FC Bayern Munich where he had his attempt saved by Oliver Kahn.

Again Zahovič clashed with his manager, Héctor Cúper, claiming he was not being given enough opportunities. Additionally, in October 2000, he was not picked up for a game at his former club for fear of reprisals from its supporters.

===Benfica===
In June 2001, Zahovič returned to Portugal and joined S.L. Benfica, as Carlos Marchena moved to Valencia. He was an important first-team member in his first three seasons, but lost his importance when manager Giovanni Trapattoni arrived at the Estádio da Luz, a situation which was aggravated in January 2005 with the purchase of Nuno Assis. This in part resulted in a mutual termination of his contract, five months before it was due to expire.

==International career==
Zahovič&#x27;s first match for Slovenia was on 7 November 1992, a friendly match with Cyprus. The national team qualified for UEFA Euro 2000 in Belgium and the Netherlands, with Zahovič scoring nine goals in 15 games. In the finals he continued to excel, netting three of the side&#x27;s four goals in an eventual group stage exit where his performances earned him comparisons to David Beckham.

Slovenia also managed to qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, another first. However, after being replaced by manager Srečko Katanec in the 63rd minute of the first group fixture against Spain (1–3 loss), Zahovič insulted the coach, who immediately sent him home following the match.

Zahovič retired from the national team in December 2003, but reversed his decision two months later. He made his last appearance for the national team on 28 April 2004 against Switzerland, totaling 80 caps and 35 goals (at the time both records), which made him the most successful Slovenian footballer since the country&#x27;s independence in 1991 and the inception of its football association into FIFA the following year; his international appearances total was surpassed by Boštjan Cesar on 15 November 2014.

==Administrative career==
Immediately after his retirement from professional football, in June 2005 at the age of 34, according to an interview with Pozareport.si, Zahovič was offered a head coach position of the Benfica juniors, but opted for a return to his homeland where, in 2007, he became the director of football at NK Maribor. He remained in that position until March 2020. Under his guidance, the club won eight Slovenian PrvaLiga titles, reached the UEFA Champions League group stages twice (2014–15 and 2017–18) and the knockout phase of the UEFA Europa League in 2013–14.

==Personal life==
Zahovič&#x27;s son, Luka, is also a footballer. A striker, he too represented Slovenia at international level. When Luka scored a late equaliser in a Champions League group stage match between Maribor and Sporting CP, on 17 September 2014, the two became only the second father and son pair – first among Europeans – to have both scored in the competition since 1992 when the competition was established in its current format.

In his young years, Zahovič played chess and practised ski jumping.

<text>The Pacific swallow (Hirundo javanica) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family Hirundinidae. It breeds in tropical southern Asia and the islands of the south Pacific. It is resident apart from some local seasonal movements. This bird is associated with coasts, but is increasingly spreading to forested uplands. It was formerly treated as conspecific with hill swallow, the welcome swallow and the Tahiti swallow.

==Taxonomy==
The Pacific swallow was formally described and illustrated in 1789 by the Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman based on a specimen collected on the Indonesian island of Java. He coined the binomial name &quot;Hirundo javanica&quot;. The Pacific swallow was formerly considered to be conspecific with the Tahiti swallow (&quot;Hirundo tahitica&quot;). The species were split based on the differences in morphology.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;H. j. javanica&quot; Sparrman, 1789 – south Myanmar and Andaman Islands to south Vietnam, east to Philippines and south to Moluccas and Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands
* &quot;H. j. namiyei&quot; (Stejneger, 1887) – Ryukyu Islands (south Japan) and Taiwan
* &quot;H. j. frontalis&quot; Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1832 – north, west New Guinea including Raja Ampat Islands (northwest New Guinea), Aru Islands (southwest of New Guinea), Geelvink Bay islands and islands off north coast
* &quot;H. j. albescens&quot; Schodde &amp; Mason, IJ, 1999 – south, east New Guinea and satellites
* &quot;H. j. ambiens&quot; Mayr, 1934 – New Britain and satellites (southeast Bismarck Archipelago)
* &quot;H. j. subfusca&quot; Gould, 1856 – Admiralty Islands, New Ireland and satellites (north Bismarck Archipelago) to Solomon Islands (except Rennell Island and including Temotu), Ouvea (west Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia), and Vanuatu to Fiji and Tonga (west, central Micronesia)

==Description==
This species is a small swallow at in length. It has a blue-black back and crown with browner wings and tail, a red face and throat, and dusky underparts. It differs from the barn swallow and the closely related welcome swallow in its shorter and less forked tail.

==Behaviour==
The Pacific swallow builds a neat cup-shaped nest, constructed with mud pellets collected in the beak, under a cliff ledge or on man-made structures such as a building, bridge or tunnel. The nest is lined with softer material, and the clutch is two to three eggs. It is similar in behaviour to other aerial insectivores, such as other swallows and the unrelated swifts. It is a fast flyer and feeds on insects, especially flies, while airborne.

<text>The hill swallow (Hirundo domicola) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family. It breeds in southern India and Sri Lanka. It is resident apart from some local seasonal movements. This bird is associated with coasts, but is increasingly spreading to forested uplands. It was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the Pacific swallow.

== Description ==

This species is a small swallow at . It has a blue back with browner wings and tail, a red face and throat, and dusky underparts. It differs from the barn swallow and the closely related welcome swallow in its shorter and less forked tail.

== Behaviour ==

=== Reproduction ===
The hill swallow builds a neat cup-shaped nest, constructed with mud pellets collected in the beak, under a cliff ledge or on man-made structures such as a building, bridge or tunnel. The nest is lined with softer material, and the clutch is up to four eggs. Detailed studies on the breeding ecology of the species were conducted in Silent Valley National Park and Muthikkulam reserve forests of Kerala.

=== Feeding ===
It is similar in behaviour to other aerial insectivores, such as other swallows and the unrelated swifts. It is a fast flyer and feeds on insects, especially flies, while airborne.

<text>Pretzel Logic is the third studio album by American rock band Steely Dan, released on February 20, 1974, by ABC Records. It was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, California, with producer Gary Katz. The album was Steely Dan&#x27;s last to be made and released while the group was still an active touring band, as well as the final album to feature the band&#x27;s full quintet-lineup of Becker, Fagen, Denny Dias, Jim Hodder, and Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter (who subsequently left to join the Doobie Brothers), though it also features significant contributions from many prominent Los Angeles-based studio musicians.

A commercial and critical success, the album&#x27;s hit single, &quot;Rikki Don&#x27;t Lose That Number&quot;, helped restore Steely Dan&#x27;s radio presence after the disappointing performance of their previous album. &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; was reissued on CD in 1987, and remastered in 1999, to retrospective critical acclaim.

==Recording and production==
Like Steely Dan&#x27;s previous albums, &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles, produced by Gary Katz, and written primarily by Walter Becker and bandleader Donald Fagen, who also sang and played keyboard. The album marked the beginning of Becker and Fagen&#x27;s roles as the principal members of Steely Dan, and the pair enlisted prominent Los Angeles-based studio musicians to record numerous overdubs. Jim Hodder, Steely Dan&#x27;s founding drummer, was reduced to a background singer on the album, which instead features drummer Jim Gordon on most tracks, with Jeff Porcaro playing on two tracks. In addition to playing guitar, Jeff &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter can be heard playing pedal steel guitar and some hand drums. After costs grew prohibitive at the Village Recorder, the project was moved to the new Cherokee Studios in the distant Chatsworth neighborhood of San Fernando Valley. 

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; contains shorter songs and fewer instrumental jams than Steely Dan&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; (1973), as the group had decided to attempt to produce complete musical statements within the three-minute pop-song format. Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that the album&#x27;s solos are &quot;functional rather than personal or expressive, locked into the workings of the music&quot;.

The music on the album is characterized by harmonies, counter-melodies, and bop phrasing, and often relies on straightforward pop influences. The syncopated piano line that opens &quot;Rikki Don&#x27;t Lose That Number&quot; develops into a pop melody, and the title track transitions from a blues song to a jazzy chorus.

Steely Dan often incorporated jazz into their music during the 1970s. For example, on this album, &quot;Rikki Don&#x27;t Lose That Number&quot; appropriates the bass pattern from Horace Silver&#x27;s 1965 song &quot;Song for My Father&quot;, and &quot;Parker&#x27;s Band&quot; features riffs influenced by Charlie Parker and a lyric that invites listeners to &quot;take a piece of Mr. Parker&#x27;s band.&quot; Baxter&#x27;s guitar playing drew on jazz and rock and roll influences, and on the instrumental cover of Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;East St. Louis Toodle-Oo&quot;, he recreates a classic Tricky Sam Nanton trombone solo on pedal steel. On that same track, Walter Becker uses talk box guitar to recreate James &quot;Bubber&quot; Miley&#x27;s famous plunger-muted trumpet melody. Certain songs on the album incorporate additional instrumentation, including exotic percussion, violin sections, bells, and horns. Victor Feldman played a flapamba solo to introduce the song &quot;Rikki Don&#x27;t Lose That Number&quot; on the album, but this intro was removed from the single release upon orders from Geffen Records.

&quot;Charlie Freak&quot; recounts the tale of a vagrant drug-addict who sells his only possession—a gold ring—to the narrator so he can buy a fix, which kills him.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s cover photo featuring a New York pretzel vendor was taken by Raeanne Rubenstein, a photographer of musicians and Hollywood celebrities. She took the photo on the west side of Fifth Avenue and 79th Street, just above the 79th Street Transverse (the road through Central Park), at the park entrance called &quot;Miners&#x27; Gate&quot;.

==Marketing and sales==
&quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; was released by ABC Records on February 20, 1974, and it sold well. In the United States, it charted at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and became Steely Dan&#x27;s third album to be certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After the disappointing performance of the singles from &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot;, the album restored the group&#x27;s radio presence with the single &quot;Rikki Don&#x27;t Lose That Number&quot;, which became the biggest pop hit of their career, peaking at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. On September 7, 1993, &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; was certified Platinum by the RIAA, recognizing the shipment of one million copies in the U.S.

==Critical reception==

The album received critical praise at the time of its release. Bud Scoppa of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called the album&#x27;s &quot;wonderfully fluid ensemble sound&quot; unprecedented in popular music, and said the ambiguous lyrics &quot;create an emotionally charged atmosphere, and the best are quite affecting.&quot; &quot;Down Beat&quot; asserted that &quot;there are no better rock recording groups in America, and damn few worldwide.&quot; Robert Christgau found the album innovative, writing in &quot;Creem&quot;: &quot;The music can be called jazzy without implying an insult, and Donald Fagen and Walter Becker are the real world&#x27;s answer to Robert Hunter and Jerry Garcia.&quot; In a mixed review, Noel Coppage of &quot;Stereo Review&quot; was impressed by the music on the album, but said that &quot;the lyrics baffle me; maybe they know what they&#x27;re talking about, but I can&#x27;t get a clue.&quot;

At the end of 1974, &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; was named &quot;NME&quot; magazine&#x27;s album of the year. It was also voted the second-best album of 1974 in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of prominent critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Christgau, who created the Pazz &amp; Jop, ranked &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; number one on his own year-end list, and later wrote that the album encapsulated Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;chewy perversity as aptly as its title&quot;, with vocals by Fagen that &quot;seem like the golden mean of pop ensemble singing, stripped of histrionics and displays of technique, almost [...] sincere, modest.&quot;

In &quot;The All-Music Guide to Rock&quot; (1995), Rick Clark gave the album five stars out of five and wrote that, &quot;On &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; Steely Dan most successfully synthesized their love for jazz into their dense pop/rock sound.&quot; Allmusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;richest&quot;, and wrote that Becker and Fagen&#x27;s songwriting was &quot;seamless while remaining idiosyncratic and thrillingly accessible.&quot; Patrick McKay of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; called the album &quot;superb&quot;, and noted that it found Becker and Fagen &quot;relying instead on crack studio musicians that could realize their increasingly complex compositions&quot;. Rob Sheffield, writing in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), said that, when making &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot;, &quot;Steely Dan&#x27;s songwriting and Fagen&#x27;s singing were at their peak of fluid power: The whole album is flawless&quot;.

&quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; has appeared on retrospective &quot;greatest albums&quot; lists. In 1994, it was voted number 67 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;, with Larkin calling the album&#x27;s mix of jazz, R&amp;B, and pop styles &quot;highly inventive&quot; and &quot;greater than the sum of its parts&quot;; it fell to number 292 in the update of the ranking from the year 2000. In 2003, the album was ranked number 385 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;; it dropped one position, to number 386, on the 2012 update of the list. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<text>Mahendra Kapoor (9 January 1934 – 27 September 2008) was an Indian playback singer. In a long career spanning decades, his repertoire included popular songs such as &quot;Chalo ekbaar phir se Ajnabi ban jayen hum dono&quot; (Gumrah) and &quot;Neele Gagan ke tale&quot; (Hamraaz). His name however became most closely associated with patriotic songs including Mere Desh Ki Dharti in Manoj Kumar&#x27;s film Upkaar. He considered Mohammad Rafi as his Guru. In 1972, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India. He lent his voice to actor Manoj Kumar in most of his films and had a lengthy association with director-producer Baldev Raj Chopra.

==Biography==

Mahendra Kapoor was born in Amritsar, but soon moved to Bombay. At an early age, he was inspired by legendary singer Mohammed Rafi and considered him his mentor. He started learning classical music under classical singers like Pt. Hussanlal, Pt. Jagannath Bua, Ustad Niaz Ahmed Khan, Ustad Abdul Rehman Khan and Pt.Tulsidaas Sharma. Kapoor created a style of his own moulded largely on Rafi and won the Metro Murphy All-India singing competition, which led to his debut as a playback singer in V. Shantaram&#x27;s Navrang in 1958, singing &quot;Aadha Hai Chandrama Raat Aadhi&quot;, under the musical direction of C. Ramchandra. Some of Kapoor&#x27;s most notable songs were the ones he performed in B.R. Chopra&#x27;s films (Dhool Ka Phool, Gumrah, Waqt, Hamraaz, Dhund, Nikaah and Awam (film) and TV series Mahabharat); and for Manoj Kumar (Upkaar, Purab Aur Paschim).

Kapoor had a very large vocal range, and he is sometimes known as &quot;The Vibrant Voice of India&quot;. He was the first Indian playback singer to record music in English. He was asked by the group Boney M to sing their songs in Hindi with Musarat from Pakistan, which resulted in the Pop Album &quot;M-3&quot;. Some of the songs on the album are &quot;Chori Chori Chalo!!&quot; (Original, Hoorray! Hoorray! by Boney M), &quot;O Meri Champe Ki Daali&quot;. Most of the hit songs sung by Mahendra Kapoor which are famous, are from B. R. Chopra movies or Manoj Kumar&#x27;s movies. His song from &quot;Bandhan&quot;, &quot;Shakti&quot;, &quot;Doli&quot;, &quot;Ek Nazar&quot;, &quot;Admi Aur Insaan&quot;, &quot;Sangam&quot; and &quot;Tawaif&quot; are also quite popular.

Mahendra Kapoor also sang a duet with Mohammed Rafi. The song was &quot;Kaisi Haseen Aaj Baharon Ki Raat&quot; from the 1967 film Aadmi, which was originally recorded as a duet with Rafi and Talat Mehmood. Manoj Kumar, one of the lead stars refused to use Talat&#x27;s voice for him and the song was re-recorded with Kapoor replacing Talat.

Kapoor sung in a large number of Indian languages and is the playback singer who has performed in the largest number of in Gujarati, Punjabi, Bhojpuri and Marathi movies. In Marathi, he was very popular for being the voice of Dada Kondke in all his movies. In spite of being associated with Dada Kondke&#x27;s colloquial style his singing for Marathi movies was not limited to Dada Kondke&#x27;s movies only.

Kapoor was married and had three daughters and one son. His son Rohan Kapoor is an actor and singer, who acted in a few films in the 1980s such as Yash Chopra&#x27;s Faasle (1985) and Love 86 (1986), and Prakash Mehra&#x27;s &quot;Imandaar&quot;, and later did stage shows together with his father.

On September 27, 2008, Kapoor died following a cardiac failure at his home in Mumbai, aged 74. He was survived by his wife, children, children-in-law and grandchildren.

Mahendra Kapoor is one of the golden era singers. He remained as one of the most popular singers in Bollywood who has given his voice to almost all of the popular heroes and leading well known actors. For Punjabi movies, he has given his voice to Varendra, Mehar Mittal, Prem Nath and many more.

<text>Sokobanja (, ) is a spa town and municipality located in the Zaječar District of the eastern Serbia. As of 2022, the population of the town is 7,188, while population of the municipality is 13,199.

== Geography ==
Sokobanja is one of the most popular tourist resorts in Serbia. It is situated in the southern part of Sokobanja valley, surrounded by mountains Ozren, Devica, Janior, Rtanj, and Bukovik. The Moravica River runs through Sokobanja. It creates a canyon just 2 km before entering the town. Remains of the Roman and later medieval Serbian fortress Sokograd stand today near the canyon of Moravica.

The Moravica was known for the clear water and the abundance of the crayfish. The 1945 edition of the Politika newspaper reports about the export of the crayfish from Sokobanja, stating that &quot;they were transported from Moravica by airplanes to Paris, London and Monte Carlo&quot;. 

Artificial Lake Bovan on the Moravica is situated some 10 minutes drive to the west of Sokobanja. Sokobanja is on elevation of about 369 m, although some parts of the town are on higher elevation.

===Climate===
On the graph below it is possible to see climate data for Sokobanja in period 2018-2023.Temperatures are rising in this region so Sokobanja is now bordering Humid subtropical and Humid Continental climate, since winter averages are about 1 degrees and summer averages are above 22 degrees.

== History ==

The settlement changed name a lot during its history, but from the Roman times it was always connected to its spa function (Serbian &quot;banja&quot;): Balnea, Banja, Velika Banja (&quot;Great Spa&quot;), Aleksinačka Banja (&quot;Aleksinac Spa&quot;), Sokol Banja.

== Tourism ==

Sokobanja, as both the thermal and air spa, is one of the most popular tourist resorts in Serbia.

Satirist Branislav Nušić coined the rhyme &quot;Sokobanja, Soko-grad, dođeš mator, odeš mlad&quot; (&quot;Sokobanja, Sokograd, you come old, you leave young&quot;). He wrote it on a postcard manufactured by his friend so that he could boost the sales. After being printed in the &quot;Politika&quot; newspaper on 7 July 1934, the catchphrase became popular, surviving till today as the trademark of Sokobanja, inspiring several songs.

=== Spa ===

There are remains of the Roman thermae: wooden foundations, bricks, mosaics and round bathtubs. During the Ottoman period, the Roman foundations were used for the Turkish bath in the 16th century. The Turks kept the original round shape of the pools as in the hamams they are usually square-shaped. Above each pool, there is a dome with holes which functions as the natural ventilation. Ottoman &quot;defter&quot; from 1560 mentions the repairs of the hammam. In the 18th century, Samuel von Schmettau wrote about the marble baths.

The first physician to the spa was appointed in 1833 by the Serbian ruling prince Miloš Obrenović, only 20 days after the town was liberated from the Ottomans. It was a surgeon Georgije Đorđe Novaković, originally Leopold Ehrlich, a Jew from Galicia, who switched to Serbian Orthodox Church after moving to Serbia. At that time, he was only one of three physicians in entire Serbia, not counting the military ambulances.

In 1834, Prince Miloš ordered the mineral waters from Sokobanja to be sent to Vienna, Austria, for testing which confirmed the positive healing effect of the water. In 1835, on prince&#x27;s invitation, German geologist August von Herder among other thermal springs and mining localities, visited Sokobanja. He compared its waters to those from the Austrian spa Bad Gastein. In 1837 Prince Miloš ordered the construction of hospital (&quot;špitalj&quot;) in Sokobanja, with &quot;20 rooms with floors&quot;, including the accommodation for the guests, physicians, and Turkish bath (hammam) workers.

On 21 June 1837, Prince Miloš signed an order for a sergeant major Lazarević from the Military-police office in Kragujevac to be sent to Sokobanja for a healing treatment. This date is today considered as the starting date of the spa tourism in Serbia. Prince renovated and expanded the Turkish bath and appointed Austrian doctor Leopold Ehrlich as the first spa doctor. Prince personally visited the spa a lot and built several other objects, like the Prince Miloš Fountain, on the road to Aleksinac, Miloš&#x27; Konak in downtown Sokobanja, today a restaurant, and Miloš&#x27; bathtub in the hammam. The prince&#x27;s bathtub, which still in use today just as the entire hammam complex, is short but deep, has its own tap and is placed in a separate room. There are two other pools, &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;, with hot water from the underground springs.

The spa became quite popular among the cultural elite and was visited by writers, poets, painters, sculptors, actors, directors. Apart from Nušić, it was visited by Jovan Cvijić, Isidora Sekulić, Stevan Sremac and Meša Selimović, while the Nobelist author Ivo Andrić draw a graphic of the town. During World War II, Andrić moved from Belgrade to Sokobanja in 1942 for a while. He originally stayed in the villa &quot;Mon repos&quot; and then moved to &quot;Bota&quot;, which is today within the hospital complex. According to Andrić&#x27;s diary, during his stay in the spa, he finished the short story &quot;Snake&quot; and began writing some of his most important works: novels &quot;The Bridge on the Drina&quot; and &quot;Woman from Sarajevo&quot; and short story &quot;Jelena, the woman of my dream&quot;. Re-visiting Sokobanja and the villa &quot;Bota&quot; in 1973, Andrić wrote: &quot;I am fearful, this place will become famous. The world will rush in and I will have to run away from here and try to find a new spa. But where can I find beauty and peace like this?&quot;.

The Turkish bath in Sokobanja is the only still functioning such facility in eastern Serbia. Under the name &quot;Staro banjsko kupatilo&quot; (&quot;Old spa bath&quot;) it is protected by the state and declared a cultural monument. It is colloquially also called the Roman Bath, the Turkish Bath or the &quot;Amam&quot; (the word &quot;hamam&quot; as pronounced in the eastern Serbian dialects that feature H-dropping). The venue served as the setting for the film &quot;Zona Zamfirova&quot; in 2002. The bath was renovated in 2005.

Water from springs in Sokobanja are hipertermal and hipotermal. Hipertermal water contains microelements and small amounts of radioactive Radon and Kalium. Radioactivity on spring &quot;Park&quot; is 186±10 mBq/l if we talk about Alpha particles and 283±17 mBq/l from Beta particles. The illnesses which are being treated in the spa include asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, respiratory infections, allergies in children, cardiovascular diseases, rheumatism, neurological and gynecological illnesses, physical and psychic exhaustion, etc. In September 2023 construction of the heating pipeline which would conduct hot spring water from the Ozren mountain to the town began. The grid will be used for the heating of public buildings.

=== Soko Grad ===
Soko Grad (&quot;Соко Град&quot;), also known as &quot;Sokolac&quot;, was a medieval city and fortress east of Sokobanja. The fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1982, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia.

The fortress originates from the Roman, early Christian period. It was founded in the 6th century during the reign of Emperor Justinian I, to prevent incursions of Pannonian Avars and Slavs into the Balkan peninsula. In 1172, it was occupied by Stefan Nemanja and became part of the medieval Serbian state. There is evidence that the fortress was razed during Stefan Nemanja&#x27;s rule, as part of the prosecution of the Bogumils.

The fort was rebuilt and expanded in the late 13th and early 14th centuries on the foundations of the Roman fort. It was mentioned later during the reign of Despot Stefan Lazarević. The Ottoman Empire occupied it in 1398. The town was destroyed in 1413 by the Ottomans during the 1402–13 civil war, in the battle between Musa Çelebi and the local Turkish chieftain Hamuz Beg. Today the only visible remains of the upper town are the gate, walls, and three towers.

=== Vrmdža ===

In the village of Vrmdža, to the north, there are remains of another fort, Town of Vrmdža (&quot;Vrmdžanski grad)&quot;. It was also originally a Roman fortress built during the rule of Emperor Justinian I and was also destroyed in 1413.

The village was revived in the 21st century, with the growing tourism on the Rtanj mountain. The villagers began to revitalize the objects, with the help of the village diaspora from the United States, Switzerland and Italy. Some immigrants returned with families, but also some foreigners moved their families to Vrmdža, renovating over 40 houses. The old school, built in 1851 and operational until 1863, and then being turned into the monastery&#x27;s &quot;konak&quot;, has been adapted into the museum. There are also a monument to the soldiers of World War I and an unusual medieval church. Dating from the 13th century, it has only one room and frescoes on the ceiling. It was reconstructed and annexed in 1819.

The locality is close to the former Tsarigrad Road, which connected Belgrade and Istanbul. Next to the road are two rocks, named &quot;Nikolina stena&quot; and &quot;Devojačka stena&quot; after the folk tales. The first one was named after a young man Nikola who slipped and got killed after trying to pick a flower for his girlfriend, while the other (&quot;Girl&#x27;s&quot;) was named after a girl who committed suicide by jumping of it so that she wouldn&#x27;t be ravaged by the Ottomans. There is also a Vrmdža Lake, old renovated watermill, wooden bridge over the Oravica stream, and a sawmill.

=== Other features ===
Other attractions include swimming in the Moravica river and the Lake Bovan, which is especially popular among fishermen, galleries, museums, various concerts and festivities, hiking, wellness centers, hotels, aqua park, saunas, etc. Festivals include &quot;Saint John the Herbs-picker&quot; (in July; dedicated to the medicinal herbs picking on the surrounding mountains of Ozren, Rtanj, and Devica), &quot;Green Heart Fest&quot; (in July; the rock and house music festival) and &quot;Marathon of the wishes&quot; (in September). Since 1983, a &quot;Golden hands&quot; cooking festival has been held annually in July. Only the old, traditional local meals are prepared. Hiking is organized on the Ozren, Rtanj, Devica, and Bukovik mountains, while the popular excursion sites are the Sesalac cave, Očno, Kalinovica and Lepterija, known for the natural phenomenon, an apparent image of the Mother of God in the boulder.

In the neighborhood of Gradašnica, on the river of the same name, there were 13 watermills, built from the early 19th century. They all went out of service by the 1960s. One of them has been renovated and became operational again, but only for the touristic purposes so that visitors can grind the cereals and knead dough themselves. On Ozren Mountain there is a large, single boulder in the middle of the vast meadow. It has been called the &quot;Stone of love&quot; as, allegedly, those who exchange kisses of vows sitting on the rock will stay together forever. According to the folk story, military commander and rebel Hajduk-Veljko and female hajduk Čučuk Stana, exchanged vows at this location.

Special hospitals for lung diseases (Hospital for non-specific lung diseases, founded in 1978) and ophthalmology are situated on Ozren mountain, surrounded by the forest. The lung hospital is a legal successor of the original, 1837 hospital. Major boost to the tourism was opening of the Hotel Sunce (&quot;Sun&quot;) in 1977. The edifice with specific design is located next to the Moravica river in the eastern section of Sokobanja. The town center of Sokobanja is home to the 19th-century buildings of elementary school and Serbian Orthodox church.

In the village of Jošanica, to the northwest, there is a Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God. Founded in the 11th century, it is the oldest existing church in eastern Serbia. Closer to Sokobanja, on the Ozren mountain, there is a Jermenčić Monastery, founded in the 14th century by the Armenians who were fleeing the invading Ottomans. Southeast of Sokobanja, on the slopes of Ozren, there is a seasonal Ripaljka waterfall. It exists only during the spring after the snow melts on the mountain. Already by May, it is usually dry.

== Demographics ==
According to 2022 census of population, there were 13,199 inhabitants in the municipality and 7,188 in the town and municipal seat. The area has been depopulating for decades. The number of inhabitants in the municipality peaked in 1953 (pop. 24,621), while the largest population in the town was recorded in 1991 (pop. 8,439).

<text>Gérard Philipe () (born Gérard Albert Philip, 4 December 1922 – 25 November 1959) was a prominent French actor who appeared in 32 films between 1944 and 1959. He came to prominence during the later period of the poetic realism movement of French Cinema in the late 1940s. His best known credits include &quot;Such a Pretty Little Beach&quot; (1949), &quot;Beauty and the Devil&quot; (1950), &quot;Fan Fan the Tulip&quot; (1953), &quot;Montparnasse 19&quot; (1958) and &quot;Les liaisons dangereuses&quot; (1959).

During his career he performed with some of the most famous and glamorous leading ladies of the era including Jeanne Moreau, Michèle Morgan, Micheline Presle, Danielle Darrieux, Gina Lollobrigida and Anouk Aimée.

As well as a successful film career, he was also a highly regarded classical actor, later achieving further fame when he became a member of Jean Vilar&#x27;s Théâtre national populaire where he performed in many of the greatest plays from the repertoire of French drama. He was, until his premature death, one of the main stars of the post-war period. His image has remained youthful and romantic, making him one of the most beloved cultural icons in French cinema.

==Early life==
Gérard Albert Philip was born on 4 December 1922 in the villa Les Cynanthes in Cannes (Alpes-Maritimes), into an affluent family, made up of Marcel Philip (1893-1973) who was a wealthy barrister, businessman and owner of various hotel establishments on the Côte d&#x27;Azur and in Paris. His mother was Maria Elisa &quot;Minou&quot; Philip, née Vilette (1894–1970) and he had an older brother, Jean, who was one year his senior. His mother was the daughter of a pastry chef based in Chartres and a Czech emigrant who came directly from Prague. Making Philipe one-quarter Czech ancestry from his maternal grandmother. In 1936, his father became a member of the Nationalist League of the Croix-de-Feu, later becoming enthusiastic about Jacques Doriot and his dream of national-socialism à la française, joined the French People&#x27;s Party and became secretary of the federation of Cannes.

In 1928, Gérard was, with his brother Jean, an intern at the Stanislas Institutei High School in Cannes run by the Marianists, where he was a good student. There, at the beginning of the war, he obtained his baccalaureate.

As a teenager, Philipe took acting lessons before going to Paris to study at the Conservatoire of Dramatic Art.

In 1940, the Philip family moved to Grasse where Marcel managed the Parc Palace Hotel, Grasse. As the owner-manager of the Parc palace-hôtel, his father housed the Mussolinian general staff there in 1940 and then the Nazi general staff in 1943. However, it was during this period in the early 40s, that many artists joined the free zone, with the Côte d&#x27;Azur becoming a hive of intense activity.

In 1941, Philipe began studying law in Nice, as it was expected he would become a lawyer like his father, but after confiding in his mother, he considered leaving this path to become an actor, a move which his father opposed. The same year, the filmmaker Marc Allégret met Maria, who occasionally practiced as a clairvoyance at her husband&#x27;s hotel. Knowing that her son dreamt of being in the theatre, she persuaded the director to audition him. He therefore auditioned Gérard, asking him to perform a scene from Étienne, a play by Jacques Deval where a 17-year-old son sees his vocation as an actor thwarted by his father. He is impressed by &quot;a kind of violence [...] that we felt ready to boil over at any moment&quot;. The filmmaker advised him to enroll in the Center des jeunes du cinema in Nice, then sent him to take drama classes with Jean Wall and Jean Huet in Cannes.

Philipe had already enrolled in the faculty of law in Nice in 1942, but after meeting many refugee artists on the Côte d&#x27;Azur, then in the free zone since 1940, he finally made the decision to become an actor, with his mother supporting him in this endeavour.

===Early Training===
Philipe auditioned in 1942 in front of Maurice Cloche for the adventure film &#x27;Les Cadets de l&#x27;océan&#x27;, but did not get a role. He also did an essay for Le Blé en herbe alongside Danièle Delorme, but the project was censored by the Vichy regime. He eventually made his theatre debut in Une grande fille tout simple, by André Roussin. The premiere of which took place on 11 July at the Cannes Casino. The play was a great success and toured in the south of France, as well as in Switzerland. His talent is already appreciated and recognized by his peers.

In order to satisfy his mother&#x27;s superstition, he adds an &#x27;e&#x27; to his surname, so his first name and surname now form 13 letters. A name he would use professionally for the rest of his life.

It was whilst attending the Conservatory of Dramatic Art in Paris that Philipe made his debut in Nice at the age of 19 on 11 October 1943 in Paris at the Théâtre Hébertot in a production by Georges Douking., where he played Angel in Jean Giradoux’s &#x27;Sodome et Gomorrhe&#x27; (1943) opposite Edwige Feuillère, this original production was a commercial success and ran for over two hundred performances. It was this performance that made him an star overnight. It was as a result of his success on the stage, that led to him receiving film offers, and within five years he would achieve international fame in the cinema.

In 1943, Philipe toured with the play Une Jeune Fille sais by André Haguet, which met with success in Paris. He confirmed his acting gifts. Marc Allégret first hired him for a silhouette in the film La Boîte aux rêves, directed by his brother Yves, then gave him a small role in Petites du quai aux fleurs. The Philip family moved to rue de Paradis, in the 10th arrondissement of Paris . Gérard acquires his financial independence and lived with Jacques Sigurd on the rue du Dragon, in Saint-Germain-des-Prés. His friend, who would write many screenplays and dialogues in the films in which Gérard would play, introduced him to modern literature and introduced him to Caligula by Albert Camus . He obtained his first success and fame at the age of twenty, in the role of the angel of Sodom and Gomorrah by Jean Giraudoux. The director of the theatre, Jacques Hébertot, testifies: “From the first rehearsals, we realised that we had nothing to teach this young actor. He was inhabited&quot;. Despite the success, Gérard Philipe enrolled at the National Conservatory of Dramatic Art, took lessons from Denis d&#x27;Inès and won the second prize for comedy the following year, having been admitted to compete despite being in first year. At the Conservatoire, in 1944 he met the future poet Georges Perros with whom he would remain linked all his life.

In February 1943, Philipe had a Cannes doctor draw up a certificate confirming that he had suffered from pleurisy three years earlier and that his condition remained fragile: &quot;65kg for 1.83m&quot;, which allowed him to be reformed. Another certificate was made in June 1943. This pleurisy will cause health concerns for the young man later. If some of his friends joined the Resistance, it is not certain that Gérard Philipe knew it then: the displayed opinions of Mr. Philip must have made them quite suspicious. Gérard Philipe will not join the Resistance until the very last hour.

From 20 to 25 August 1944 he took part in the Liberation of Paris, notably from the Hôtel de Ville, Paris, in the company of thirty people under the orders of Roger Stéphane. From October he took lessons from Georges Le Roy “He taught me to stand up straight, with my knees outstretched, facing life, like a healthy man.

In 1945, his father, Marcel, was sentenced to death in absentia for his crimes of collaboration. This resulted in the confiscation of his property on 22 November 1945 for intelligence with the enemy and membership in an anti-national group. Using his son&#x27;s contacts, he was able to flee to Spain where he became a French teacher in Barcelona. Gérard, Anne and their children would pay him frequent visits.

==Career and Stardom==
===Film===
Philipe made his film debut in &quot;Les Petites du quai aux fleurs&quot; (1943), directed by Marc Allégret, in an uncredited role.

He had a minor role in &quot;Box of Dreams&quot; (1945) then was third billed in &quot;Land Without Stars&quot; (1946) after Jani Holt and Pierre Brasseur; George Lacombe wrote and directed.

When he was 19 years old, he made his stage debut at a theatre in Nice; and the following year his strong performance in the Albert Camus play &quot;Caligula&quot; made his reputation.

Philipe had a lead role in &quot;The Idiot&quot; (1946), an adaptation of the novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky, co-starring Edwige Feuillère for director Georges Lampin. This was seen in other countries and established Philipe as a leading man. He was in &quot;Ouvert pour cause d&#x27;inventaire&quot; (1946), a short film that was an early work for Alain Resnais.

He was invited to work with the &quot;Théâtre national populaire&quot; (T.N.P.) in Paris and Avignon, whose festival, founded in 1947 by Jean Vilar, is France&#x27;s oldest and most famous.

Philipe gained fame as a result of his performance in Claude Autant-Lara&#x27;s &quot;Devil in the Flesh&quot; (1947), alongside Micheline Presle. It was a huge box office success.

He went on to star in &quot;La Chartreuse de Parme&quot; (1948) for director Christian-Jacque, which was even more popular than &quot;Devil in the Flesh&quot;. He followed it with &quot;Such a Pretty Little Beach&quot; (1949) for Yves Allégret; &quot;All Roads Lead to Rome&quot; (1949), a reunion with Presle, for Jean Boyer; and &quot;Beauty and the Devil&quot; (1950) for René Clair.

Philipe was one of several stars in Max Ophüls&#x27; version of &quot;La Ronde&quot; (1950). He followed it with another all-star film, &quot;Lost Souvenirs&quot; (1951) for Christian-Jacques.

In 1951, Philipe married Nicole Fourcade (1917–1990), an actress/writer, with whom he had two children. She adopted the pseudonym, Anne Philipe, and wrote about her husband in two books, the first called &quot; Souvenirs&quot; (1960) and a second biography titled &quot;Le Temps d&#x27;un soupir&quot; (&quot;No Longer Than a Sigh&quot;, 1963).

Philipe was in &quot;Juliette, or Key of Dreams&quot; (1951) with Suzanne Cloutier for Marcel Carné; &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot; (1952), an all-star anthology film; and &quot;Fan Fan the Tulip&quot; (1953), a swashbuckling adventure with Gina Lollobrigida for Christian-Jacque which was very popular.

He was in &quot;Beauties of the Night&quot; (1952), again with Lollobrigida, and Martine Carol, directed by Clair; &quot;The Proud and the Beautiful&quot; (1953) with Michèle Morgan; two more all-star anthologies: &quot;It Happened in the Park&quot; (1953) and &quot;Royal Affairs in Versailles&quot; (1954).

Philipe tried an English movie, &quot;Lovers, Happy Lovers!&quot; (1954, also known as &quot;Knave of Hearts&quot;), directed by René Clément and co-starring Valerie Hobson.

He then did &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; (1954) with Danielle Darrieux and had a big success with &quot;The Grand Maneuver&quot; (1955) for René Clair, co-starring Morgan.

Philipe did &quot;The Best Part&quot; (1956) for Yves Allégret and was one of many stars in &quot;If Paris Were Told to Us&quot; (1956).

He wrote, directed and starred in &quot;Bold Adventure&quot; (1956), a comic adventure film.

He starred in &quot;Lovers of Paris&quot; (1957) for Julien Duvivier and &quot;Montparnasse 19&quot; (1958) for Jacques Becker. He was one of many stars in &quot;Life Together&quot; (1958) and top billed in &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1958).

In 1958 he went to New York and performed on Broadway in the all-French &quot;Lorenzaccio&quot; and &quot;Le Cid&quot;.

Philipe played Valmont in Roger Vadim&#x27;s modern day version of &quot;Les liaisons dangereuses&quot; (1959), appearing alongside Jeanne Moreau.

His last film was &quot;Fever Mounts at El Pao&quot; (1960) for Luis Buñuel.

===Théâtre National Populaire (TNP)===
 Finally, in November, Gérard Philipe came to find Jean Vilar in his box at the Théâtre de l&#x27;Atelier, after a performance of Henri IV by Luigi Pirandello. Vilar testifies: “While removing my make-up that evening, I looked out of the corner of my eye at this famous boy whom I did not know well. Tall, erect, with a rare gesture, a clear and frank gaze, his presence was made up of both calm strength and fragility. I told him that I was preparing the Festival d&#x27;Avignon 1951, that is to say the fifth Festival, and that it was the only undertaking I could assure him of. He replied immediately that he would therefore be from the next Avignon. Two days later, I gave him Le Prince de Hombourg . He says yes. I added: And The Cid? He lowered his head, smiled, then fell silent. Indeed , two years earlier, the actor had refused the role of Rodrigue, to the chagrin of the director.

This meeting also marked Philipe: “A conversation with Vilar, his remarks on the theater, his opinion on the plays that I burned to play, left me won over. One of Vilar&#x27;s great qualities is his patience. Me, I was playing impatient. But when he made me read The Prince of Hombourg , I no longer hesitated to follow him [...]&quot;
Léon Gischia, decorator and costume designer alongside Jean Vilar, was convinced that one of the major reasons that prompted Philipe to offer himself to work with Vilar, &quot;are these new relationships, this new contact that Vilar had been able to create with his audience. - this young public, this popular public which was to become that of the TNP and for which Gérard already felt and has never ceased to feel such a deep need”.

Adventure of the TNP
The following year, Jean Vilar was appointed director of the Théâtre national populaire (TNP) and led a troupe made up of young actors and actresses with promising careers such as Philippe Noiret, Jeanne Moreau, Charles Denner and Daniel Sorano. Philipe declared: “for me, the TNP is my home, it&#x27;s my house”. Rehearsals for Le Cid and Le Prince de Hombourg began on 30 May, and after a difficult start Philipe managed to appropriate the role of Rodrigue thanks to Jean Vilar:“Everything seems possible to me since Vilar, to my great surprise, asked me to interpret the Cid. He won, not me.

The premiere of Prince de Hombourg took place on 15 July at the Festival d&#x27;Avignon, in the main courtyard of the Palais des Papes On the 17th, Philipe was injured during the last dress rehearsal by falling 2.50 meters, fortunately cushioned by his thick suit 18 . If he is forced to play motionless or seated throughout the festival, considerably weakening his playing, the piece is nonetheless a triumph. This experience reinforces his attachment to the troupe and to Jean Vilar&#x27;s project to make theater accessible to all. Léon Gischia believes that “Avignon will have been for Gérard a marriage of love with his public; this audience that Jean had prepared for him and who was only waiting for him.

On 29 September Gérard Philipe signed his one-year contract with the TNP, tacitly renewable. Despite his career and his international fame, he reassured the new director that he is ready to receive a lower fee at the cinema so as not to jeopardise the troupe&#x27;s budget. His salary is set at 30,000 francs gross per month (€ 750 in 2019), to which are added 400 francs per rehearsal (€10 in 2019). Jean Vilar later went on to say that in eight years, Philipe did not ask for any increase in salary, preferential treatment or special clauses. Also, to make the company truly democratic, his name appeared in its alphabetical place on all the posters.

Philippe Noiret told biographer (and husband of Philipe&#x27;s daughter, Anne), Jérôme Garcin that it was customary, even when his fellow actors were acting in the same play, to &quot;stop at the gallery to admire Philipe&#x27;s acting, fascinated by his way of possessing the stage&quot;.

He was joint president of the French actors’ union, Federation Internationale des Acteurs, (along with Jean Darcante) at the time of his death.

==Death==
 On 5 November 1959 he was admitted to hospital at the Violet Clinic, 60 rue Violet (Paris 15th), where he was diagnosed with liver cancer. His wife and the doctors concealed the nature of his disease, letting him believe that the operation was a successful operation against an abscess, to spare him dealing with the tragic news. He was working on ideas for plays and films he planned to work on for when he got better, one of which was Hamlet. He died from liver cancer, on 25 November 1959, at his home on the Rue de Tournon, Paris, a few days short of his 37th birthday.

His untimely death caused a deep outpouring of shock and emotion in France, due to his great popularity as an actor and French icon. Jean Vilar paid him a final tribute on 28 November, on the stage of the Théâtre de Chaillot: “Death struck high. She mowed down the very one that […] for us expressed life. […] Hard worker, secret worker, methodical worker, he nevertheless mistrusted his gifts which were those of grace&quot;.

In accordance with his last wishes, he was buried, dressed in the costume of Don Rodrigue (The Cid), in the village cemetery in Ramatuelle, Var, near the Mediterranean coast.

To commemorate the centenary of the cinema in 1995, the French government issued a series of limited edition coins that included a 100 franc coin bearing the image of Philipe. Among the most popular French actors of modern times, he has been elevated to mythic status in his homeland, not least because of his early death at the peak of his popularity.

==Personal life==
It was in 1942, that Gérard first met Nicole Navaux, who was an ethologist and wife of diplomat François Fourcade. It was in 1946, after Nicole divorced her first husband, that she and Philipe became engaged, marrying on 29 November 1951 at the town hall of Neuilly-sur-Seine. Upon marriage Gérard asked his wife if she could use her first name, Anne, which he found to be more poetic. They soon had two children: Anne-Marie Philipe (born 21 December 1954) and Olivier Philipe (born 10 February 1956). They spent their time as a family between the boulevard d&#x27;Inkermann in Neuilly, and later rue de Tournon in Paris. They spent summer holidays together in Ramatuelle, in Provence, in a property belonging to Anne&#x27;s family. In 1954, they bought a property in Cergy, on the banks of the Oise. Here they found a haven of peace, away from hectic Parisian life, a place to receive their friends including Georges Perros, Agnès Varda, Claude Roy, René Clair).

Philipe was a supporter of the Communist Party. He criticized however the Soviet intervention in Hungary in 1956. In 1959 he visited the communist leader of Cuba, Fidel Castro, on his invitation.

==Honours==

&quot;Rue Gérard Philipe&quot; is a street in the 16th arrondissement of Paris named in his honour.

In 1961, his portrait appeared on a French commemorative postage stamp.

The &quot;Gérard Philipe Theatre&quot; (TGP) in Paris was named after him. From 1962 to 2000, the &quot;Grand Prix Gérard Philipe de la Ville de Paris&quot; was awarded almost annually by the city of Paris for the best actress or best actor at a Parisian theatre. Prize winners included Gérard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil, Maria de Medeiros and Isabelle Carré.

There is also a film festival named in his honour as well as a number of theatres and schools (such as the College Gérard Philipe – Cogolin) in various parts of France. A cultural centre is named after him in Berlin.

<text>Tolmin (; , German &quot;Tolmein&quot;) is a small town in northwestern Slovenia. It is the administrative centre of the Municipality of Tolmin.

==Geography==
Tolmin stands on the southern rim of the Julian Alps and is the largest settlement in the Upper Soča Valley (), close to the border with Italy. It is located on a terrace above the confluence of the Soča and Tolminka rivers, positioned beneath steep mountainous valleys. The old town gave its name to the entire Tolmin area () as its economic, cultural and administrative centre.

The area is located in the historic Goriška region, itself part of the larger Slovene Littoral, about north of Nova Gorica and west of the Slovene capital Ljubljana. In the north, the road leads further up the Soča River to Bovec, with an eastern branch-off to Škofja Loka and Idrija.

==History==

Early inhabitants were Illyrians in Tolmin area. It was ruled successively by the Roman Empire, Odoacer, the Ostrogoths, the Eastern Roman Empire and part of the Lombard Duchy of Friuli until it was conquered by the Frankish king Charlemagne in 774 and replaced by the Carolingian March of Friuli.

Ancestors of Slovenes had come to this area during the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps from about 600 onwards, embattled by Avar raids. It was passed to Middle Francia in 843 after the Treaty of Verdun and in 952 passed to the vast March of Verona, which was initially ruled by the Dukes of Bavaria, from 976 by the Carinthian dukes. King Henry IV of Germany ceded it to the newly established Patria del Friuli in 1077, before it was occupied by the Republic of Venice in 1420. Finally the Tolmin area was conquered by the Habsburg Emperor Maximilian I during the War of the League of Cambrai in 1509.

Tolmin was then ruled with the possessions of the extinct Counts of Gorizia as part of the Inner Austrian territories of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1713 it was the centre of a peasant revolt against increased taxation and the local Count Coronini. It was part of the Illyrian Provinces, which were part of Napoleonic French Empire between 1809 and 1814 before returning to Austrian rule. Until 1918, the town (under bilingual names &quot;Tolmein - Tolmin&quot;) was part of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy (Austrian side after the compromise of 1867) and head of the district of the same name, one of the 11 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in the Austrian Littoral province. A post-office was opened in October 1850 under the German name (only).

After World War I it was ruled by the Kingdom of Italy between 1918 and 1943 (nominally to 1947). It was a county (comune) center in Province of Gorizia between 1918 and 1923 and again between 1927 and 1943 (nominally to 1947) and in Province of Friuli between 1923 and 1927 during Italian rule as &quot;Tolmino&quot;. After the Italian capitulation, it was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1943 and was part of Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral before liberation by Yugoslav partisans. After temporary division of Julian March by Morgan Line, Tolmin was part of Zone-B, which was under Yugoslav administrators. It was officially passed from Italy to Yugoslavia in 1947 after the Treaty of Paris. Finally Tolmin was passed to Slovenia after breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991.

==Main sights==

Tolmin&#x27;s main sights are its old town centre, a modern sports park, and thousand-year-old castle ruins at the hill known as &quot;Kozlov rob&quot;.

The area is home to a multitude of vestiges from World War I. The most significant relic of the time is the Javorca Church, dedicated to the Holy Spirit built above the Polog shepherds outpost in the Tolminka Valley by Austro-Hungarian soldiers to commemorate their deceased comrades.

The museum, library, schools, and the town’s open spaces provide venues for a variety of events, exhibitions, and presentations all year round. The Tolmin region is also a popular destination for artists from Slovenia and abroad.

The parish church in the town is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary and belongs to the Diocese of Koper.

Tolmin is known for the &quot;Metalcamp&quot; festival since 2004, which since 2013 is called Metaldays, which every year attracts about 10,000 people from whole Europe and other parts of world. Other festivals held in Tolmin are Punk Rock Holiday and the Overjam reggae festival.

The Tolmin Gorges () are located north of Tolmin, in Zatolmin and Žabče, on the Tolminka River.

<text>Tiffany &quot;Tiffani&quot; Jane Wood (born 8 November 1977) is an Australian singer and songwriter, and former member of female pop group Bardot.

==Career==
In 1999, Wood auditioned for the first Australian season of &quot;Popstars&quot;, a reality television show which aimed to create a new girl group. After selections for the group were finalised by the judges, Wood just missed out. However, after original member Chantelle Barry departed the group shortly after its inception, Wood was selected to replace her as the group&#x27;s fifth member. The group became known as Bardot.

&quot;Popstars&quot; aired in early 2000 and became a ratings success. Bardot became the first Australian act to debut at number one with both its debut single, &quot;Poison&quot;, and self-titled debut album. Further singles &quot;I Should&#x27;ve Never Let You Go&quot;, &quot;These Days&quot;, &quot;ASAP&quot;, &quot;I Need Somebody&quot; and &quot;Love Will Find A Way&quot; all reached the top 20 on the Australian singles chart. Bardot also promoted their music internationally, with promotional tours across Singapore, Taiwan, New Zealand, India and the United Kingdom. Following the release of their second album, &quot;Play It Like That&quot;, Bardot disbanded in May 2002.

Wood briefly signed as a solo artist to Warner Music Australia and released her debut single, &quot;What R U Waiting 4&quot; in March 2004. The track peaked at number 27 on the Australian singles chart. In 2005, she established her own independent record label Mudhoney Records, and released three singles – &quot;Devil in Your Soul&quot;, &quot;Spin the Bottle&quot; and the Divinyls song &quot;I Touch Myself – which featured on her debut solo album &quot;Bite Your Tongue&quot;, released in October 2006.

In 2008, following the birth of her first child, Wood released an album of lullaby music called &quot;Acoustic Dreams – Lullabies for Babies&quot;.

In 2007, Wood appeared in the stage musical &quot;Las Vegas Confidential – The Musical&quot; and in 2009, she reunited with former Bardot bandmate Katie Underwood in the stage show &quot;Valentino&quot;.

Since 2017, Wood has operated her own performing arts school in Queensland called Popstar Kidz.

In April 2020, to commemorate Bardot&#x27;s 20 year anniversary, Wood reunited online with former bandmates Belinda Chapple and Katie Underwood to perform an acapella version of &quot;Poison&quot;.

In 2024, she competed on the Nine Network reality series &quot;The Summit&quot;.

==Personal life==
Wood was married to bodyguard Neil Cummins from 2007 to 2009. She has six children.

<doc id="548597" wikidata="Q1230557" url="?curid=548597" title="Conveyor belt sushi">
<text>, also called revolving sushi or rotation sushi, is a type of sushi restaurant common in Japan. In Australasia, it is also known as a sushi train.

Plates serving the sushi are placed on a rotating conveyor belt that winds through the restaurant and moves past every table, counter and seat. The final bill is based on the number and type of plates of the consumed sushi. Some restaurants use a variation of the concept, such as miniature wooden &quot;sushi boats&quot; that travel through small canals, or miniature locomotive cars that travel on a track.

==Restaurants==
The distinguishing feature of conveyor belt sushi is the stream of plates winding through the restaurant. The selection is usually not limited to sushi; it may also include karaage, edamame, salad, soup, fruits, desserts, and other foods and drinks.

Some restaurants have RFID tags or other systems in place to remove sushi that has rotated for too long.

===Special orders===
If customers cannot find their desired sushi or dish, they can make special orders. Sometimes speaker phones are available for this purpose above the conveyor belt, while more modern restaurants use a touchscreen display or tablet for this purpose. If a small quantity of food is ordered, it is placed on the conveyor belt but marked so other customers know that this dish was ordered by someone; usually the plate with the sushi sits on a labeled cylindrical stand to indicate that this is a special order. Some restaurants use a secondary belt for this purpose, or have an automated delivery tray that will send a special order directly to where a customer is sitting. For large orders the dishes may also be brought to the customer by an attendant. 

Condiments and utensils are usually found near the seats, such as wasabi, pickled ginger, chopsticks, soy sauce, and small dishes for the soy sauce. Self-served tea and ice water is usually complimentary, with cups stacked on a shelf above the conveyor belt and teabags or green tea powder in a storage container on the table. There is also a hot water faucet at the tables to make tea. On the shelves are usually wet paper towels and plastic boxes to store sushi for take-out customers.

===Billing===
The bill is calculated by counting the number and type of plates of the consumed sushi. Plates with different colors, patterns, or shapes have different prices, usually ranging from 100 yen to 500 yen or the local equivalent (for example, a conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Iceland may offer a price range of 250 to 480 krónur). The cost of each plate is shown on signboards or posters in the restaurant. In general, cheap items come on plain plates, and the level of plate decoration is related to the price. The most expensive items tend to come on gold colored plates. Expensive items may be placed on two plates, with the price being the sum of the prices of the individual plates. Some conveyor belt sushi restaurant chains, such as Kappa Sushi or Otaru Zushi, have a fixed price of 100 yen for every plate. This is similar to the phenomenon of 100-yen shops. A button above the conveyor belt can be used to call the attendants to count the plates. Some restaurants have a counting machine where the customer drops the plates to be counted automatically, or they use RFID tagged plates and just count each stack at once with a special reader.

===Conveyor operation===
The sushi conveyor consists of a thin, narrow conveyor designed to fit within the tight confines of a sushi restaurant. Nearly 100% of sushi conveyors made in Japan are manufactured in Ishikawa Prefecture.

The standard conveyor uses a specially designed plastic crescent top chain. The chain actually runs on its side (on its link plates), with the crescent plate attached to the other side plate by means of a snap pin. This gives the chain a very small bending radius and allows the conveyor to make the tight corners found in most conveyor belt sushi restaurants. Further, the horizontal layout means that there is no return side of the chain, which not only eliminates chain sag and sliding with the roller, but allows for a much shallower design.

Major chain companies can offer different pin materials (stainless steel being common), plate shapes, surface treatments, and so on depending on the individual application. Many customers are also turning to sushi conveyor manufacturers for custom-designed plates to go with their conveyor. Innovations in sushi conveyors include chainless designs for quieter operation and design/layout freedom, multi-tiered conveyors to allow for more sushi to be displayed in limited spaces, and high speed lanes for custom orders.

==History==
Conveyor belt sushi was invented by Yoshiaki Shiraishi (1914–2001), who had problems staffing his small sushi restaurant and had difficulties managing the restaurant by himself. He got the idea of a conveyor belt sushi after watching beer bottles on a conveyor belt in an Asahi brewery. After five years of development, including the design of the conveyor belt and the speed of operations, Shiraishi opened the first conveyor belt sushi &quot;Mawaru Genroku Sushi&quot; in Higashiosaka in 1958, eventually expanding to up to 250 restaurants all over Japan. However, by 2001, his company had just 11 restaurants. Shiraishi also invented a &quot;robotic sushi&quot;, served by robots, but this idea has not had commercial success.

Initially in a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, all customers were seated to face the conveyor belt, but this was not popular with groups. Subsequently, tables were added at right angles to the conveyor belt, allowing up to six people to sit at one table. This also reduced the length of conveyor belt necessary to serve a larger number of people.

A conveyor belt sushi boom started in 1970 after a conveyor belt sushi restaurant served sushi at the Osaka World Expo. Another boom started in 1980, when eating out became more popular, and finally in the late 1990s, when inexpensive restaurants became popular after the burst of the economic bubble. In 2010, Akindo Sushiro was the most famous conveyor belt sushi brand in Japan.

In 2023, some patrons were arrested for deliberately performing unhygienic acts such as licking or drinking from items passing in front of them towards other customers. These acts, dubbed &quot;sushi terrorism&quot;, were performed as pranks with the video being shared online. Asked about this, Agriculture Minister Tetsuro Nomura said: “It is very unfortunate that such an act took place, as it had a significant impact on food industry operators and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries will pay special attention to the situation in the future.”

<doc id="548599" wikidata="Q1420047" url="?curid=548599" title="Lotus Esprit">
<text>The Lotus Esprit is a sports car built by Lotus Cars from 1976 to 2004 at their Hethel, England factory. It has a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Together with the Lotus Elise / Exige, it is one of Lotus&#x27; most long-lived models.

The Esprit was among the first of the (near) straight-lined, hard-edge creased, and sometimes wedge-shaped, polygonal &quot;folded paper&quot; designs of the prolific, and highly successful Italian industrial and automotive designer Giorgetto Giugiaro. The Esprit&#x27;s backbone chassis was later adapted to carry the body of the DeLorean car, another low-bodied, Giugiaro-drawn, sharp-creased, wedge-shaped sportscar design. In 1978, the first updates led to the series 2 and engined Esprit S2.2, made until the 1982–1988 Series 3 and Turbo Esprit models, that used a 1980 Giugiaro designed aerodynamic and aesthetic restyling package.

The Lotus Esprit however, lived on through the 1990s, and into the 2000s. It received its first significant restyling by designer Peter Stevens, who also did styling on the McLaren F1. Stevens gave the Esprit overall softer lines and shapes, but the car did not get a new series number – it is instead often just called the &#x27;Stevens Esprit&#x27;, or by its project number, the X180, made from 1988 to 1994.

In 1994, an official Series 4 Esprit, drawn by designer Julian Thomson, had a further rounded shape, especially the bumper sections and lower body of the car. Styling-wise, this became the most long-lived Esprit (1994–2004), only receiving its last changes, by Russell Carr in 2002.

Over the years, the performance of the Esprit&#x27;s 4-cylinder engine was increased from around and just under of torque, to double those power figures, mainly through greater inlet and exhaust flow, and strong turbo-charging. And from 1996, a new V8 twin-turbo engine was added, offering . Contrary to a long list of low-volume British (sports) cars, with the 3.5 l Rover V8 engine, the Esprit received a Lotus in-house designed V8. Top speed rose from some in 1976, to over for the V8, twenty years later.

After a 28-year production run, the Esprit was one of the last cars made with pop-up headlights, together with the 5th generation Chevrolet Corvette.

==Background==
In 1970 Tony Rudd, who had started at Lotus the previous year, proposed two new model development projects. The first, Project M50, resulted in the 1974 Elite. The second, Project M70, meant to develop a successor to the Europa which, like the Europa, was to be a two-door fixed-head mid-engine coupé.

A meeting between Colin Chapman and Giugiaro was arranged in 1971 by designer Oliver Winterbottom, who also suggested that Giugiaro use his Maserati Boomerang concept as the inspiration for the new Lotus.

Work began on the new car in mid-1971 with production of a 1:4 scale model. According to Italdesign, Chapman was disappointed with the wind-tunnel test results with the model and halted the project, but the Italian coachbuilder pressed on and built a full-size mock-up on a stretched, modified Europa chassis. That nameless prototype, often simply called &quot;the Silver Car&quot;, appeared on the Italdesign stand at the 1972 Turin Auto Show and the positive reception convinced Chapman to approve further development.

Development continued with production of a second prototype, registered as &quot;IDGG 01&quot; and known as &quot;the Red Car&quot;, that would be a functional car. Design of the car&#x27;s mechanical systems progressed, but was not complete when the Esprit was officially announced.

==S1 (1976)==
The Esprit was launched in October 1975 at the Paris Motor Show and entered production in June 1976, replacing the Europa in the Lotus model lineup. These first cars became known as &quot;Series 1&quot; (or S1) Esprits. The wedge-shaped fibreglass body was mounted on a steel backbone chassis. Power was from the Lotus 907 four-cylinder engine that was rated at in European trim and in US/Federal trim. The engine was mounted longitudinally behind the passengers and drove the rear wheels through a Citroën C35 5-speed manual transaxle also used in the SM and Maserati Merak. Rear brakes were mounted inboard, following contemporary racing practice. The Series 1 embodied Lotus&#x27; &quot;performance through light weight&quot; mantra, weighing less than .

Front suspension consisted of upper A-arms and lower lateral links triangulated by the anti-roll bar. Rear suspension consisted of tapering box-section trailing arms and lower lateral links. The half-shafts had no provision for plunge and handled some of the lateral forces. There were coil-over shock absorbers and disc brakes at all four corners. Steering was by an unassisted rack and pinion.

While the S1 Esprit was lauded for its handling and was said to have the best steering of any Esprit, it was generally regarded as being under-powered, especially in markets such as the United States where the engine was stifled by emission controls. Lotus&#x27; claim of acceleration from in 6.8 seconds and a top speed of may have been optimistic, as actual road tests revealed a 0-60 mph acceleration time of 8 seconds and a top speed of about .

The S1 Esprit was distinguished from later Esprits by its snow-shovel style front air dam, Fiat X1/9-sourced taillights, absence of body-side ducting, and Wolfrace alloy wheels. Inside the car, the S1 Esprit had a one-piece instrument cluster with green-faced Veglia gauges. The S1 is rare in the present day, mostly due to drivetrain problems.

==S2 (1978) and derivatives==
In 1978, the revised Series 2 (or S2) Esprit was introduced. External changes included intake and cooling ducts added behind the rear quarter windows; bigger, ribbed taillights, this time from the Rover SD1, and a new front spoiler that was now integrated, folding rearward under the nose and so forming the start of the car&#x27;s initially modest, thin black side-skirts.

S2 Esprits also had Speedline alloy wheels designed by Lotus. Other changes included relocating the battery from above the right side fuel tank under the rear quarter window to the rear of the car, adding an access door to the engine cover, installing wider seats and replacing the Veglia instrument cluster with individual gauges made by Smiths and a new style of illuminated dashboard switches. Many switches and buttons came from the Morris Marina.

A special edition model was released to commemorate Lotus&#x27; victory in the 1978 F1 World Championship. Wearing the black and gold livery of John Player &amp; Sons (JPS), Lotus&#x27; F1 sponsor at the time, these cars were known as the Commemorative Edition Esprits as Lotus had stopped being sponsored by JPS. They were mechanically identical to the regular 2.0, with special seat and dash trim, smaller steering wheel and special plaque. According to Lotus a series of 300 were built, but it is likely the total was considerably lower. Lotus&#x27; production records are notoriously vague, but reliable estimates suggest that 149 Commemorative Esprit cars were made.

The S2.2 was a stop-gap model introduced in May 1980 whose only major difference from the S2 was, as indicated in its model name, having a 2.2 L type 912 engine. Engine power output was unchanged but torque rose from to . The S2.2 received a galvanised chassis, but not the revised chassis structure to come in the Series 3. S2.2 cars are extremely rare even among Esprits. According to Lotus only 88 were produced during its thirteen-month production span.

===Essex Turbo Esprit (1980)===
In 1980 the Essex Turbo Esprit was launched. This special edition model wore the blue, red and chrome livery of the Essex Overseas Petroleum Corporation, the sponsor of Team Lotus from 1979 to 1981. While Lotus dealer Bell and Colvill had been offering turbo conversions for the S2 Esprit from as early as 1978, the Essex Turbo Esprit was the first factory turbocharged Esprit. The Essex Turbo Esprit received the dry sump type 910 engine which has a power output of at 6,250 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm. Acceleration from 0- could be achieved in 6.1 seconds and a top speed of .

The chassis and rear suspension were redesigned, with an upper link added at the rear to alleviate strain on the half-shafts. The brakes were also improved. Giugiaro designed an aerodynamic body kit for the car, with a rear lip spoiler, prominent louvered rear hatch, more substantial bumpers, a deeper front airdam, and air ducts in the sills just ahead of the new three-piece 15-inch Compomotive rear wheels. Inside scarlet leather combined with a roof-mounted Panasonic stereo for a dramatic environment. 45 Essex Turbo Esprit cars were built, interspersed and followed by a number of non-Essex-liveried but otherwise identical specification dry sump turbo cars.

By the end of 1980, Lotus was building three different models of Esprit with distinct chassis designs and body moulds - the domestic (i.e. UK) S2.2, the export S2.2, and the dry sump-engined Turbo Esprit.


==S3, Turbo Esprit (1982) and derivatives==
The Series 3 (or S3) and Turbo Esprit debuted in April 1981. The two models shared a common chassis, and bodywork was based on a common set of moulds.


The S3 received the 2.2 L Type 912 engine. The Turbo Esprit had a wet sump engine with the same power and torque output as its dry sump predecessor. Interior trim was revised which, when combined with changes to the body moulds, resulted in more headroom and an enlarged foot-well. The Turbo Esprit retained the aerodynamic body kit of the Essex cars and featured prominent &#x27;turbo esprit&#x27; decals on the nose and sides. The S3 gained the new larger bumpers but kept the simpler sill line and glazed rear hatch of the S2.2 body. Both cars came with BBS alloy wheels. One interesting omission was that the Esprit S3 had no cigarette lighter as standard equipment; ashtrays are tucked away in the door sills.

Minor changes were made to bodywork and front suspension for the 1985 model year.

The final incarnations of the Giugiaro-styled Esprit were announced in April 1986. Higher compression ratios for the engines was indicated by the &#x27;HC&#x27; moniker. Power output of the naturally aspirated engine rose to and for the Esprit HC, and to and for the Turbo Esprit HC, with more torque available at lower engine speeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotusespritworld.com/ERoadtests&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

For markets with stringent emissions requirements like the United States, Lotus introduced the first fuel-injected Esprits. The HCi variant added Bosch KE-Jetronic fuel injection and a catalytic converter to the Turbo HC engine. This engine had the same peak power as the carburetted version but at a somewhat higher engine speed. Torque dropped to .

==X180 (1988) and derivatives==
In 1987, the Esprit was restyled by British designer Peter Stevens. Stevens, who would later style the Gordon Murray designed McLaren F1, produced a less angular, more rounded Esprit. Giugiaro is said to have liked the new shape, claiming it was perhaps too close to his original design. The exterior changes were accompanied by a redesign of the interior that gave more space to the occupants. The revised Esprit was not given a new &quot;Series&quot; number but is often called by its project code of X180.

Panels for the body were produced using a new process called VARI (Vacuum Assisted Resin Injection). This method, which was patented by Lotus, offered advantages over the previous hand lay-up process. Kevlar reinforcement was added to the roof and sides for roll-over protection. This contributed to a 22% increase in the Esprit&#x27;s torsional rigidity. The new rectangular taillights were borrowed over from the 1983-1985 Toyota Corolla Levin AE86.

The X180 cars inherited most of their mechanical components from the earlier HC Esprit and Turbo Esprit, although the name for the forced induction model was now Esprit Turbo. 1988 model year North American Esprit Turbo models kept the Citroën transaxle and Bosch fuel injection system used in the previous model year. Other X180 models received a new Renault UN-1 transaxle, which necessitated a move to outboard rear brakes.

Power output of the Type 910 turbocharged engine was unchanged, but 0–97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration times decreased from 5.6 seconds to between 5.4 and 5.1 seconds. Top speed was over .

In 1989, the K-Jetronic system was replaced with a Lotus/Delco multi-point fuel injection (MPFI) system. The engine also received an air-water-air intercooler called a Chargecooler by Lotus. This revised engine was known as the Type 910S. Power output was up to with available on overboost. 0–97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration times decreased to 4.7 seconds and top speed was over . The 910S engine went into the new Special Equipment (SE) model, which also received changes to the body, with side skirts parallel to the body, five air ducts in the front air dam, wing mirrors from the Citroën CX and the addition of a rear wing.

Lotus also produced the rarely seen Esprit S, a mid-range turbocharged variant offering fewer appointments and having a power output of , as well as the standard Turbocharged engine having a power output of included as an option. Original normally aspirated (Esprit) and turbo (Esprit Turbo) models were discontinued after 1990. The S models were cancelled in 1991. A unique two-litre &quot;tax special&quot; Esprit with SE trim was developed for the Italian market. Equipped with an intercooled and turbocharged version of the 900-series engine that had a power output of at 6,250 rpm, this model appeared in December 1991. This engine became available in other markets beginning in the fall of 1996.

===X180R===
In 1990, two specially prepared Esprits competed in the SCCA Escort World Challenge series. These cars started out as regular SE models but had all unnecessary equipment, trim removed and glass replaced by plexiglass. The suspension geometry was revised and Monroe shock absorbers were added. The brakes were by AP Racing, and the car&#x27;s Delco/Moraine ABS system was the first anti-lock braking system ever used on an Esprit. The Chargecooled Type 910S engine had a revised engine management system with larger fuel injectors and now had a power output of . These cars were designated Type 105 and were campaigned by the Pure Sports team headed by &quot;Doc&quot; Bundy, who helped with development. In the first season the car was able to claim six pole positions, win four races and post two one-two finishes.

Late in 1990, Lotus built 20 road-going examples of the Type 105 and gave them the name X180R. These were developed to homologate parts for the 1991 and 1992 racing seasons, specifically to allow an Esprit to campaign in IMSA&#x27;s newly formed Bridgestone Supercar Championship. With a MSRP of $126,000, these cars came with amenities like glass windows, sport seats, a heater and air conditioning. The chassis of the road-going X180R was also galvanized, in contrast to the untreated chassis of the Type 105. The special road-going 1991 model year X180Rs were only sold within the United States. They were fitted with a full roll cage, reduced sound insulation, special bucket seats, competition-type disc brakes, synchromesh gearbox with limited-slip differential, 16&quot; Revolution racing-style 3-piece wheels, special tuned suspension and shock package, racing-type front spoiler and rear wing, and competition type mirrors. The type 910S engine was developed to an officially reported 286 hp, though actual output is unknown.

Three more race cars were built for the 1991 season to be run by Lotus Sport alongside the two upgraded 105s in the American IMSA Bridgestone Supercar Championship. The new cars were designated Type 106, but adopted the X180R name as well. They had a reinforced chassis with a revised roll cage and larger wheels and tyres but weighed less than the Type 105. The engine was modified with larger fuel injectors, a better Chargecooler and the removal of the catalytic converter which caused the output to rise to . In 1991 driver/actor Robert Carradine placed second in the series and in 1992, Bundy won three races and took the driver&#x27;s title.

In 1993, the sanctioning body changed the rules such that the X180R was assessed a weight penalty, which made the cars uncompetitive.

An extensively modified derivative of the X180R was sold in Europe as the Sport 300. These are known as the fastest of the four-cylinder Esprits and among the most desirable with only 50 cars produced. The Sport 300 utilised a Garrett T4 turbocharger along with an improved Chargecooler and larger inlet valves enabling the engine to have a power output of at 6,400 rpm and of torque at 4,400 rpm. The power to weight ratio rose to 243 hp per tonne, same as the Porsche 964 Turbo 3.6. The Sport 300 could accelerate from 0–97 km/h (60 mph) in 4.7 seconds and had a claimed top speed of (tested top speed amounted to during a test conducted by British magazine Autocar in 1993).&lt;ref name=&quot;lotusespritworld.com/ERoadtests/300&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Esprit sales and production fell sharply in 1991 and 1992 as the SE started to face newer competitors like the Honda NSX.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotusespritworld.com/EHistory/Production_Figures&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==S4 (1994) and derivatives==
Another refresh of the car in 1993 penned by Julian Thomson resulted in the Series 4 (or S4). Exterior changes included a smaller rear spoiler placed halfway up the rear deck-lid, revised front and rear bumpers, side skirts and valence panels. New five-spoke alloy wheels were also fitted. The taillights from the pre-facelift Toyota AE86 were carried over from the previous generation. The S4&#x27;s engine had the same power output as the SE at . The S4 was the first Esprit to use power steering.

The S4 was complemented in 1994 by the S4 Sport (S4s). The most obvious external change from the S4 was the addition of a rear wing from the Sport 300. The engine was still a 2.2 L 910-series, but with performance-enhancing modifications that included enlarged inlet ports, cylinder head modifications, a re-calibrated ECM and a revised turbocharger. Engine output rose to and of torque. Top speed was , slalom speed , lateral acceleration increased to 0.91g and 0–97 km/h (60 mph) took 4.6 seconds.

The last iteration of the four-cylinder Esprit was the GT3, a turbocharged, Chargecooled variant with the 2.0 L Type 920 which had previously been used only in Italian market cars. The GT3 was produced alongside the Esprit V8. Lotus originally intended to produce 50 GT3 models, but following the car&#x27;s popularity, a total of 190 units were eventually built. The interior of the GT3 featured a re-designed instrument binnacle, which was narrower and more focused than the design used for previous models. Other notable interior features included a milled steel gearshift knob and a colour coded central tunnel to complement it.

===V8 (1996)===
In 1996, Lotus launched the Esprit V8. The car came equipped with Lotus&#x27; own Type 918 V8 engine. The engine is an all-aluminium 90° DOHC 4 valves per cylinder with a flat-plane crankshaft and two Garrett T25/60 turbochargers but with no Chargecooler. The transaxle used was the same Renault unit as before but upgraded by Lotus. Despite having a modified transaxle, the Type 918 engine was detuned from a potential to to prevent gearbox damage. In period tests, acceleration from 0–97 km/h (60 mph) was achieved in 4.1 seconds, with a of 12.7s at .
Top speed is over .

In 1998 the V8 range was split into SE and GT models. Both cars had revised interiors and similar performance with the SE being the more luxurious of the two and the GT being more lightweight and performance focused. 
The ultimate incarnation of the Esprit was the 1999 Sport 350. Only 50 were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotusespritworld.com/ERoadtests/350&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the ECU in the Sport 350 was remapped to have the same Lotus type 918 power output of 350 horsepower (per the name), but in different rpm / gear range (turbo spool characteristics) compared to the normal SE/GT sales version and had chassis, body and braking improvements that included thinner fibre layer in the body, AP Racing brakes and stiffer springs . Among the visual changes was a large carbon fibre rear wing on aluminium uprights in place of the standard fibreglass rear wing. The Sport 350 weighed and could accelerate to in 4.3 seconds and to in under 10 seconds.

===GT1===

Having raced the Esprit in GT2 and GT3 classes, Lotus began to develop a new version of the car to race in GT1 class racing. Development of the car was entrusted to the newly formed Lotus GT1 Engineering group, which included many staff from the recently dissolved Team Lotus Formula One team.

The Esprit GT1 was built on the Type 114 platform using the body from the new S4 road-going Esprit made from composite materials and carbon fibre. Changes to the bodywork included a new carbon fibre splitter, diffuser and floor. Power came from a Type 918 V8 engine with a single Garrett T4 turbocharger that had a power output of . The Renault transaxle was not considered adequate for the task. Where the GT2 cars used Hewland DG300 units, the GT1 would use the new TGT200 6-speed transverse transaxle. The front suspension was now upper and lower A-arms, while at the rear were upper and lower lateral links paired with upper and lower trailing links. The braking system used AP Racing carbon ceramic discs and calipers, and Penske triple-adjustable gas-pressurised shock absorbers were used at all four wheels. The chassis was similar to the production Esprit but with a roll-cage that added stiffness. Weight was reduced to .

Production amounted to 3 units: chassis 114-001, 114-002 and 114-003. Two cars debuted at the 1996 BPR Global GT Series 4 Hours of Donington. Reliability dogged the car throughout the year, with problems linked to brakes, oil pumps, oil pipes and overheating, and it was succeeded by the Type 115 Elise GT1 the next year. Two of the Esprit GT1 cars were converted to GT2 specifications. Chassis 114-001 was acquired by Mike Haines Racing, who developed it into a competitive GT2 car. Chassis 114-001 now resides in a private museum in Tokyo, Japan. Chassis 114-002 was damaged at Oulton Park and became a parts donor for the remaining cars. Chassis 114-003 was destroyed in a fire.

==Final redesign and end of production==
In 2002, the Esprit received another styling update done by future Lotus Design head Russell Carr. Carr, who had contributed to the S4 update, revised the car with changes that included replacing the pre-facelift Toyota AE86 taillights with a new design that incorporated the same round taillights as the Lotus Elise S2. Few, if any, mechanical changes were made to the car.

After a 28-year production run, the last Esprit rolled off the production line on February 20, 2004, and was shipped to Chicago. A total of 10,675 Esprits were produced. Alongside the Chevrolet Corvette C5 (which ended production on July 2, 2004), the Esprit was one of the last cars produced with retractable pop-up headlights.

==Esprit type numbers and production numbers==
==Esprit convertibles==
While Lotus Cars never developed or built a convertible Esprit, custom manufacturers stepped in to fill this market.

===St. Tropez===
The St. Tropez conversion was designed by Paul Bailey and his company PBB Design, which was established in 1987. The conversion involved removing the roof and rear bodywork. The wheel arches were also widened and new Compomotive wheels were part of the package. The A-pillar and the chassis were reinforced with steel, and a steel subframe was added in the rear.

PBB Design built three cars before the moulds were sold to Mark Irwin&#x27;s Esprit Developments, who updated the design and marketed it along with a Rover V8 conversion. Esprit Developments completed another three cars.

===Esprit Roadster===
Another Esprit convertible was built in Hamburg Germany by Autohaus Kollinger GMBH. Their Esprit Roadster was based on S2, S3 &amp; Turbo Esprit donor cars.

==Styling concept (2010)==

As part of a five-car announcement at the 2010 Paris Motor Show, Lotus unveiled a completely redesigned Esprit. Production was slated to start in late 2013 and sales in the spring of 2014.

Work on a new Esprit had started as early as 2006 under Carr. The car was unveiled during Donato Coco&#x27;s tenure as design chief and was to have featured a futuristic front-end with LED front daytime running lights and a centre-mounted dual exhaust system in the rear. Power was to come from a 5.0 litre Lexus V8 engine delivering up to through a 7-speed dual-clutch transaxle, giving a 0-60 time of 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 195 mph. A KERS system was to be optional. The interior was to have a futuristic but minimal design which included a digital instrument cluster, a sport steering wheel and carbon fibre trim scattered throughout the cabin. The design exhibited had a length of , a width of and a height of . Gross weight was stated to be around .

On 29 September 2014 Lotus cancelled the project and announced that they would not make the Esprit. Lotus had decided to continue making lightweight cars and nimble cars instead of heavier and more expensive cars due to the company&#x27;s financial position at the time.

==Parts commonality==
Lotus used a variety of parts from other cars to reduce development costs. Esprits built before 1993 used many British Leyland parts and those built in the mid-to-late 1980s incorporated more Toyota parts while those built after 1993 had many GM (Vauxhall, Opel) parts. Door handles from the Morris Marina/Austin Allegro were used until the S4 model in 1994 when GM Calibra door handles were used. Early cars used a Momo steering wheel, while later ones had the same wheel as the Pontiac Trans Am. Headlight lift motors came from the Pontiac Fiero. The aerial mount and whip on the S4 and V8 was the same as the GM Calibra and Tigra. The side mirrors were from the Citroën CX. Non-SE fog lamps from about 1989 were GM Astra Mk1. The fan motors came from the Ford Fiesta Mk2. The alternator on the V8 models was a standard GM unit also found in the V6 Opel Omega B and the earlier Lotus Carlton/Omega, which also provided interior plastic fittings such as door handles and steering column covering. The clutch master and slave cylinders on 1998 and newer models were Girling parts shared with the series 2A Land Rover.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotusespritworld.com/ERunning&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The S1 and S2 shared some front suspension components with the Opel Ascona.

The GT3&#x27;s Brembo front brake pads were the same as on a Fiat Coupé Turbo or a Peugeot 406 3.0 V6. The SE&#x27;s fuel pump was from the Renault Fuego, V8 pistons are from the Renault Clio Williams&#x27; 16-valve, 2-litre F7P engine.

==Motorsports==
* Doc Bundy won the 1992 IMSA Bridgestone Supercar Championship drivers title with the Esprit X180R. The Esprit has been used by Thorkild Thyrring to win his class in the 1993 and 1994 British GT Championship, and also driven by Richard Piper, Peter Hardman and Olindo Iacobelli, competing in the 1993 and 1994 24 Hours of Le Mans.
* Brad Jones won the 1994 Australian Super Production Car Series driving an Esprit.

==Notable appearances in film==
* An S1 Esprit was featured in the 1977 James Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, where a car famously converted into a submarine after a road chase. The car used in the underwater scenes, nick-named &quot;Wet Nellie&quot;, was bought by Elon Musk in September 2013.
* Two Essex-spec Turbo Esprits were featured in the James Bond film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;. A white one destroyed early in the film and a copper-red model appearing later.
* An X180 Esprit appeared in the film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; after Ferrari and Porsche declined the product placement opportunity because the manufacturers did not want to be associated with soliciting prostitutes. Lotus saw the placement value with such a major feature film and supplied a Silver 1989.5 Esprit SE.

<text>An indirect branch (also known as a computed jump, indirect jump and register-indirect jump) is a type of program control instruction present in some machine language instruction sets. Rather than specifying the address of the next instruction to execute, as in a direct branch, the argument specifies where the address is located. An example is &#x27;jump indirect on the r1 register&#x27;, which means that the next instruction to be executed is at the address in register r1. The address to be jumped to is not known until the instruction is executed. Indirect branches can also depend on the value of a memory location.

An indirect branch can be useful to make a conditional branch, especially a multiway branch. For instance, based on program input, a value could be looked up in a jump table of pointers to code for handling the various cases implied by the data value. The data value could be added to the address of the table, with the result stored in a register. An indirect jump could then be made based on the value of that register, efficiently dispatching program control to the code appropriate to the input.

In a similar manner, subroutine call instructions can be indirect, with the address of the subroutine to be called specified in memory. Function Pointers are typically implemented with indirect subroutine calls.

Indirect branches were one of the attack surfaces of Spectre. To mitigate the attack GCC 8.1 introduced the following new options: codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3.

<doc id="548627" wikidata="Q6971468" url="?curid=548627" title="National Childbirth Trust">
<text>The National Childbirth Trust (NCT) is the UK&#x27;s largest charity offering information and support in pregnancy, childbirth and early parenthood Since 1956 it has supported millions of parents through birth of their children and through early parenthood while bringing about advances in professional practice and public policy. The charity&#x27;s mission is to support parents through the first 1,000 days: from the beginning of pregnancy through to the child&#x27;s second birthday.

It is a movement of amateur volunteer parents supporting parents, with 327 local branches and over 5,000 volunteers offering a wide range of activities. These include drop-in sessions, sales of baby clothes and equipment, and first aid courses.

NCT&#x27;s practitioners aim to provide practical and emotional support for expectant and new parents before and after their baby arrives. Its breastfeeding counsellors and peer supporters support mothers with feeding. Its online information centre and national support line provide information to some 5m parents each year.

==History==

The National Childbirth Trust, originally called The Natural Childbirth Trust, was founded in 1956 as the result of an advertisement placed in &quot;The Times&quot; by Prunella Briance. Briance had suffered two traumatic childbirth experiences and set about changing the situation for other women, so that they would be more humanely treated during pregnancy and labour. Briance was inspired by the writings of British obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read, who is regarded by many as the father of natural childbirth, and became the first president of the NCT.

Briance&#x27;s advertisement announced &quot;A Natural Childbirth Association is to be formed for the promotion and better understanding of the Dick-Read system. Anyone interested write Box...&quot;. The inaugural meeting was held on 29 January 1957 at Caxton Hall with Grantly Dick-Read as one of the speakers. The NCA became the Natural Childbirth Trust in 1958 and the National Childbirth Trust in 1961.

===Key dates===

* 1961 renamed The National Childbirth Trust, given charitable status. Begins publishing leaflets.
* 1967 Breastfeeding Promotion Group and Teachers&#x27; Panel formed, setting training standards and services. NCT lobbies Government to research techniques thoroughly and end the overuse of interventions.
* 1980 Postnatal Committee set up, leading to Parentability (support group for disabled parents) and other support groups.
* 1989 NCT incorporated as a company limited by guarantee
* 1991 NCT gives evidence to Winterton Committee based on its own research
* 1994 Report of the Expert Maternity Group, on which Eileen Hutton, NCT&#x27;s then president, was a member, is adopted as Government policy for England and Wales
* 1997 Antenatal teacher training was validated by the University of Luton
* 1999 Parentability becomes an independent organisation, the Disabled Parents Network.
* 2001 National Breastfeeding Line launched
* 2017 NCT courses are attended by 96,000 parents-to-be and parents. It has 327 branches with over 5,000 volunteers to help support local parents. Its online support reaches 5.6 million users.

==About NCT==
The charity provides free antenatal and postnatal support and information through its nationwide network of over 300 local branches, run by volunteers.

Baby Cafés, NCT&#x27;s free feeding drop-ins primarily based in deprived areas, were used by almost 8,000 women in the UK in 2017, providing information and support about feeding. It also provided free of charge training for over 150 women to become breastfeeding peer supporters.

NCT trains peer supporters across the UK to provide support to vulnerable new parents. For example, maternity champions on the Mozart Estate in London&#x27;s Queens Park; ‘Parents in Mind’ peer support projects to help mums with poor mental health; and a project in Leeds for refugee and asylum-seeking women.

==Criticism and reviews==
In January 2013, Kirstie Allsopp, presenter of property-related television shows, sparked press comment when she tweeted, &quot;Lots of people have good NCT experiences, but many don&#x27;t. This is a very politicised, dogmatic, and in my experience scary organisation.&quot; There was further press criticism in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; concerning the TV series &quot;In the Club&quot;, featuring an antenatal class.

In April 2018, Alex Jones, TV presenter and host of BBC1&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;, published a book, &quot;Winging It!&quot;, which includes a chapter on her NCT experience, &quot;To NCT or not NCT&quot;. Her review is very positive about the charity. &quot;It is expensive and a bit middle-class but it’s the best [money] we ever spent.&quot; She was part of a multi-cultural, London group, &quot;like the United Nations&quot;, who &quot;all left feeling much better equipped to deal with what was ahead&quot;.

There was further praise in the press for NCT in June 2018 in the &quot;Glasgow Evening Times&quot;. Carolyn Lochhead, author of &quot;Three Toothbrushes and Other Essays on Motherhood&quot;, said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know anyone else with children, so the National Childbirth Trust class was fantastic . . . We helped each other through it all - birth, recovery, breastfeeding, weaning, and going back to work. We’re still great friends, five years - and four more babies - later.&quot;

<text>Cahir Castle (), one of the largest castles in Ireland, is sited on an island in the river Suir. It was built from 1142 by Conchobar Ua Briain, King of Thomond. Now situated in Cahir town centre, County Tipperary, the castle is well preserved and has guided tour and audiovisual shows in multiple languages.

==Construction==
The castle was sited on and near an earlier native fortification known as a &quot;cathair&quot; (stone fort), which gave its name to the place. The core structure of the castle dates to construction in the 13th century by the O&#x27;Brien family. The castle was built in two parts, with the side now by the street being built 200 years before the side now housing the audio-visual show.

Granted to the powerful Butler family in late 14th century, the castle was enlarged and remodelled between the 15th and 17th centuries. It fell into ruin in the late 18th century and was partially restored in the 1840s. The Great Hall was partly rebuilt in 1840.

==History==
In 1375, the castle was granted to James Butler, newly created Earl of Ormond, for his loyalty to Edward III, King of England. His son James, the second Earl (by his second marriage) passed the lands around the barony of Iffa and Offa West to his children, though they were not themselves noble. This changed by 1542 when the first of the Barons Cahir was created. Unlike their Anglican kinsmen, this branch of the Butler dynasty sided with the Roman Catholic Irish in the Elizabethan wars. In 1599, the castle was captured after a three-day siege by the army of the Earl of Essex and was, for a year, put under the charge of Sir Charles Blount. Lord Cahir joined with the Earl of Tyrone in 1601 and was attainted for treason, but later obtained a full pardon. In 1627, the castle was the scene of a celebrated killing when Cahir&#x27;s son-in-law, Lord Dunboyne, murdered his distant cousin, James Prendergast, in a dispute over an inheritance: he was tried for the killing but acquitted.

During the Irish Confederate Wars the castle was besieged twice. In 1647, George Mathew, the guardian of the young Lord Cahir, surrendered to Murrough O&#x27;Brien, 6th Baron Inchiquin (later 1st Earl, and a descendant of Cahir&#x27;s builder) following his victory at the Battle of Knocknanauss. In 1650, he surrendered again to Oliver Cromwell, during his conquest of Ireland without a shot even being fired.

In 1961, the last Lord Cahir died and the castle became the property of the Irish state.

==Protection and tourism==

In the late 20th century the castle was named a National Monument, and is now managed by the Office of Public Works, who maintain the castle and operate tours.

The interior shots of the Abbey in the 1973 television film &quot;The Conflict&quot;, were filmed at the castle. In 1981, it was used as a location for a battle scene in the film &quot;Excalibur&quot;. In 1998, the site was used as a location for Saban&#x27;s &quot;Mystic Knights Of Tir Na Nog&quot; on Fox Kids.

The castle was also used as a location for television series &quot;The Tudors&quot;. In 2019, it was used as a location for the film &quot;The Green Knight&quot; and in 2020 for the film &quot;The Last Duel&quot;.

<text>Volterra (; Latin: &quot;Volaterrae&quot;) is a walled mountaintop town in the Tuscany region of Italy. Its history dates from before the 8th century BC and it has substantial structures from the Etruscan, Roman, and Medieval periods.

== History ==


Volterra, known to the ancient Etruscans as &quot;Velathri&quot; or &quot;Vlathri&quot; and to the Romans as &quot;Volaterrae&quot;, is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the Tuscany region of Italy. The site is believed to have been continuously inhabited as a city since at least the end of the 8th century BC. 

The town was a Bronze Age settlement of the Proto-Villanovan culture. It became an important Etruscan centre as one of the &quot;twelve cities&quot; of the Etruscan League.

It was allied to Rome at the end of the 3rd century BC and became a municipium. The wealthy Caecina family lived here and Gaius Caecina Largus and the eminent Aulus Caecina Severus (consul 2–1 BC) built the theatre and probably other monuments. Other important families here were the Persii and the Laelii. Aulus Caecina was appointed &quot;propraetor&quot; of Moesia by 4 AD and later in charge of several legions on the lower Rhine after 14 AD where he led them ably, routing the army of Arminius who had destroyed three Roman legions. He was eulogised by the chroniclers for his exploits and on his return to Rome he was awarded triumph honours.

The city was a bishop&#x27;s residence in the 5th century, and its episcopal power was affirmed during the 12th century.
With the decline of the episcopate and the discovery of local alum deposits, Volterra became a place of interest of the Republic of Florence, whose forces conquered Volterra. Florentine rule was not always popular, and opposition occasionally broke into rebellion. These rebellions were put down by Florence.

When the Republic of Florence fell in 1530, Volterra came under the control of the Medici family and later followed the history of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. In 1472, during the war between Volterra and Florence in the called Allumiere war which finished with the sacking of Volterra by the Duke of Montefeltro and his army, it caused the emigration of many wealthy families and the appropiation of their goods.

<doc id="548652" wikidata="Q1852705" url="?curid=548652" title="Town-class cruiser (1936)">
<text>The Town class consisted of 10 light cruisers built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. The Towns were designed within the constraints of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. The ships were built in the sub-classes, &quot;Southampton&quot;, &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Edinburgh&quot;, each sub-class adding more weaponry.

==Armament==

Like their US and Japanese counterparts of that era, the Town-class cruisers were &quot;light cruisers&quot; in the strict terms of the London Treaty, which defined a &quot;light cruiser&quot; as one having a main armament no greater than 6.1 in (155 mm) calibre. All three major naval powers sought to circumvent the limitations on heavy cruiser numbers by building light cruisers that were equal in size and effective power to heavy cruisers. These ships made up for their smaller calibre guns by carrying more of them.

All ships of the class carried BL 6-inch Mk XXIII guns in triple turrets, with the centre gun mounted behind the two outer guns to prevent interference between the shells in flight and to give the gunners more room to work in. The turret roofs had cutouts at the front to allow extreme elevation, originally intended to give the guns an anti-aircraft capability. In practice the guns could not be trained or manually loaded quickly enough for continuous anti-aircraft fire, so the Royal Navy designed the Auto Barrage Unit (ABU) which allowed the guns to be loaded with time-fuzed shells and then fired when the target aircraft reached a set range. These ships were equipped with the HACS AA fire control system for the secondary armament and the Admiralty Fire Control Table for surface fire control of the main armament.
The secondary armament consisted of four twin Mk XIX 4-inch turrets, and two 2-pdr quad pom-poms. Additional light anti-aircraft weapons were added during the war and the 4-inch mounts were converted to Remote Power Control (RPC). Postwar and were partially reconstructed in 1949–51 with enclosed bridges, new lattice masts, improved surface fire control and long range radar and an improved but still unreliable version of the Glasshouse Directors with Type 275 &#x27;lock and follow&#x27; radar, with flyplane control for the twin 4-inch guns with elevation speed increased to 15–20 degrees per second to engage faster jet aircraft. Similar electronic alterations were made to but it received less structural alteration. was put into reserve in 1952 to preserve it for potential modernisation and had a less extensive refit to allow her to be sent quickly if needed in the Suez crisis of 1956. &quot;Birmingham&quot;, &quot;Newcastle&quot; and &quot;Sheffield&quot; had the pom pom and 20 mm armament replaced by 40mm Bofors mounts. &quot; Belfast&quot; was fitted with MRS 8 HACDT to combine 40 mm and twin 4-inch AA fire and to permit the use of 40 mm proximity fuze ammunition as used by the British Army.

==Sub-classes==

===&quot;Southampton&quot;===
In the mid-1930s, the was the Royal Navy&#x27;s latest light cruiser design, with the intention that it number six vessels. Following the new, heavily armed small cruisers of the United States and Japanese es, the last two planned ships, and , were cancelled and re-ordered as a new, much larger cruiser type, with the new ships named as and . Based on the initial design chosen in November 1933, the estimated cost of the new ships was £2.1m each compared to an estimated cost of £1.6m each for a cruiser.

Initially the class was designated the &quot;M&quot; or &quot;Minotaur&quot; class but was renamed the Town class in November 1934.

Uniquely, the final &quot;Southampton&quot; class cruiser, HMS &quot;Birmingham&quot;, was built with a fully flared bow and is easily distinguished by the lack of the prominent knuckle found on her sister-ships. This was due to some elements in the Admiralty being doubtful of the benefits offered by the knuckle design. This modification was introduced during construction in March 1935 but was not continued in the follow-on &quot;Gloucester&quot; class.

===&quot;Gloucester&quot;===
The subsequent &quot;Gloucester&quot;s added a second director control tower for two channels of fire at long range against ship or shore targets and better protection against plunging fire with a redesigned deck, an intermediate layer of armour above the magazines and machinery area and received thicker armour on the gun turrets. The extra weight is balanced with extra beam, increased from 64.02 ft in the Southampton to 64.10 ft in the three Gloucester ships and more propulsion power with 82,000 shp engines to maintain speed and add more electrical generation.

===&quot;Edinburgh&quot;===

The &quot;Edinburgh&quot; class were longer at compared to , initially to allow an increase in the main armament from twelve 6 in (152 mm) guns in four triple turrets as in the two previous sub-classes, to sixteen 6 in guns in four quadruple turrets. The idea was soon shelved however due to the difficulties in actually manufacturing an effective quadruple 6 in turret and so the class reverted to the original main armament design, although improved through a &quot;long trunk&quot; Mk XXIII turret design, which reduced the crew requirements and increased the speed of the ammunition hoists. Four extra 4 in (102 mm) &quot;High Angle Low Angle&quot; guns and eight extra 2-pounder (40 mm) guns and further armour protection were added instead.

Additional ships using the design of &quot;Belfast&quot; were considered by the Admiralty in 1940 but were eventually rejected.

==Later improvements==
All were heavily modified during the Second World War and after the Korean War; , and had one aft turret replaced by two quad 40 mm Bofors guns during the Second World War, since there was insufficient space to fit the needed extra anti-aircraft guns and retain the turret. This was not a problem in the &quot;Edinburgh&quot;s, because they were longer and had more room. They still had substantial modifications to their weaponry, including addition of 40 mm Bofors guns. The addition of radar equipment during the Second World War aided the ships&#x27; combat effectiveness.

==Service==
The first Town-class ship was launched in 1936 and commissioned in 1937, just two years before the outbreak of war. The class saw much service during the Second World War and took part in many famous actions, such as the sinking of the . Four ships — , , , and — were sunk during the war. The surviving ships continued in active service to the end of the 1950s, some seeing action during the Korean War. The last Town-class ship to be scrapped was &quot;Sheffield&quot; in 1967. One ship of the Town class — — remains, moored on the River Thames in London as a museum-ship of the Imperial War Museum, a role she has performed since 1971.

<text>Boryslav (, ; ) is a city located on the Tysmenytsia (a tributary of the Dniester), in Drohobych Raion, Lviv Oblast (region) of western Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Boryslav urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Boryslav is a major center of the petroleum and ozokerite industries. Population: 

==History==
===Bronze age===
The area of the modern town of Boryslav has been inhabited at least since the Bronze Age. There are remnants of a pagan shrine from the 1st millennium BC located in the area, where approximately 270 petroglyphs are found, mostly depicting solar signs – symbols of a pre-Christian Solar deity.

===Development of the community===

Between the 9th and 13th centuries, the site of the modern town housed a fortress named &quot;Tustan&quot;, which was part of a belt of similar strongholds defending the Kievan Rus&#x27; from the west and south. After the dissolution of Kievan Rus&#x27;, the town became a part of the Halych-Volhynian Principality.

With the collapse of the latter, in 1387 Boryslav became a part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1772, during the Partitions of Poland, it was annexed by Austria and became a part of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.

===Oil and ozokerite production===

One of the great technological developments of the 19th century was the discovery by pharmacists Johan (Jan) Zeh (:uk:Зег Ян, :pl:Jan Zeh) (1817–1897)) and Ignacy Łukasiewicz, in nearby Lviv, of technology that led to the establishment of a new industry based on petroleum. Scientists worked out a method of distilling Boryslaw crude oil, and on 30 March 1853 made the first kerosene lamp. As early as 31 July 1853 their new lamp was used to illuminate the Public Hospital in Lviv. Their discoveries marked the beginnings of the rapid search for petroleum in the Carpathians — especially in the eastern sector of the mountain chain where rich oil deposits were discovered. In 1854 the first ozokerite mine was started in the town after the ore was discovered by Robert Doms. In the second half of 1853, following the research of Jan Zeh, Ignacy Łukasiewicz and several other scientists working in the nearby city of Lemberg (the then official name of Lviv), the town and its surroundings saw the emergence of an oil industry. One of the first oil rigs in the world was built near Boryslav by Robert Doms in 1861. The number of oil rigs also rose from 4,000 in 1870 to over 12,000 three years later. The oil boom drew many industry moguls from all over Austria-Hungary and many fortunes were earned and lost there. A period of prosperity saw the city&#x27;s population grow as almost 10,000 new workers arrived to the area. In 1886 an oil mining school was opened in Borysław, one of the first such facilities in Europe. Also the ozokerite, a natural mineral wax, mined in Borysław, was used for insulation of the first trans-Atlantic telegraphic cable line. On 31 December 1872, a railway line linking Borysław with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych, Ukraine) was opened. In 1909, more than 1,920,000 tonnes of oil were produced in the region — roughly 5% of the world&#x27;s oil production at that time making the region the third biggest producer of oil after the US and the Russian Empire in the world.

===Poland===

After the Great War the area became part of the new West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. After the Polish-Ukrainian War of November 1918 – July 1919 the area became part of the newly reborn Poland. In 1920 the mining school was significantly expanded and was renamed to Carpathian Geological Station, a &quot;de facto&quot; oil mining university. As the capital of the &quot;Zagłębie Borysławskie&quot; (&quot;Borysław Oil Basin&quot;), the town of Borysław was the centre of then Polish oil and ozokerite extraction industries and one of the most important industrial zones of Poland. Because of that, on 26 July 1933 the town was granted a city charter. Together with the nearby settlement of Tustanowice (Tustanovychi, now part of Boryslav), Boryslaw produced in 1925 about 80% of Polish oil (812,000 tons). Boryslav was then commonly called the &quot;Polish Baku&quot;. In the period 1929–1936, oil extraction shrank from 511,000 to 319,000 tonnes of oil annually.

===World War II===
In 1939, it was allocated to the Ukrainian SSR after the Soviet invasion of Poland, the town was annexed by the Soviet Union under the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. It was renamed &quot;Boryslav&quot;. In 1941, the city fell under German control upon the advances of the German army to the east at the start of Soviet–German hostilities.

====Jewish casualties====
About 13,000 Jewish residents lived in Boryslav at the beginning of the war. On the day following the Germans&#x27; arrival, local Ukrainians launched a pogrom, participated in by some German soldiers, that murdered approximately 350 Jews and wounded and robbed many more. The first official anti-Jewish actions began at the end of November 1941, when around 1,500 Jews, the majority of whom were deemed weak and unable to work, were shot by the Ukrainian militia and German security police in the forest near the town of Truskavets. During the winter of 1941–1942, many Jews died of hunger and disease, including typhus. In May 1942, an official ghetto was established; some Jews from neighboring towns were brought there to live. At the beginning of August 1942, Jews, including those from neighboring villages, like Pidbuzh and Skhidnytsya, were rounded up by the German police, Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, and Jewish police. Some were shot on the spot, about 400 were sent to the Janowska labor camp near Lwów, and 5000 were sent to Belzec where they were immediately gassed.

Two separate ghettos were created in Boryslav, including one for workers in the oil industry. In October 1942, the German and local Ukrainians and Poles, led by German soldiers, rounded up more than 1000 Jews and sent them to Belzec to be murdered. In another action in November, about 1500 Jews were rounded up, held for three weeks under depraved conditions in a local cinema, and then sent to Belzec.
During the fifth action in February 1943, 600 Jews were shot by members of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, German police, and the Schupo. The isolated executions of Jews in hiding took place all the time from May till June 1943 until the total liquidation of the Boryslav ghetto at the end of June 1943. Over the course of one week, the German forces murdered around 700 Jews (sick, young and elderly Jews and members of the Jewish Police). Other Jews were hunted down by Ukrainian and German forces and shot. The remaining Jews were deported to different labor camps (Plaszów and Mauthausen) from April to June 1944. In all, over 10,000 Jews native to Boryslaw were shot by Germans and Ukrainians or murdered in the camps.

====Jewish lives saved====
Some Jews escaped and formed partisan units in the forests. Resistance groups in the ghetto obtained some arms and set fire to some raw materials in ghetto industry.

The manager of the German Karpathen oil company, Berthold Beitz, and his wife Else Beitz rescued about 250 people in one day when he had them pulled off a train at Boryslav who were headed for the Belzec extermination camp in July 1942. Beitz had also helped adults and children escape across the Hungarian border. Saying that the Jewish people were crucial to oil production during the war, Berthold and Else rescued about 800 people between 1941 and 1944. Berthold and Else Beitz were recognized as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem.

For a description of the activities in Boryslav during the war, see the &quot;Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos&quot;. A personal-account history of this period is recounted by the Polish-American writer — and Boryslav native — Wilhelm Dichter in his popular and acclaimed literary debut, &quot;Koń Pana Boga&quot;. It is a memoir of the war in Borsylav as Dichter experienced it as a Polish-Jewish child.

The title of Righteous Among the Nations belongs to the Miniv family from Boryslav

===After World War II===

Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the town came again under Soviet rule. Most local Poles were expelled to Poland, with a sizeable group settling in Wałbrzych, now a twin town of Boryslav. Since 1991, the town has been part of an independent Ukraine. The oil industry remains operating. Experts believe that potential oil fields around Boryslav contain far more stocks.

Until 18 July 2020, Boryslav was designated as a city of oblast significance and belonged to Boryslav Municipality. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Lviv Oblast to seven, Boryslav Municipality was merged into Drohobych Raion.

<text>The  (WGT; German for &quot;Wave Gothic Meeting&quot;) is an annual world festival for &quot;dark&quot; music and &quot;dark culture&quot; in Leipzig, Germany. 150+ bands and artists from various backgrounds (gothic rock, EBM, industrial, noise, darkwave, neo-folk, neo-classical and medieval music being examples) play at several venues throughout the city over four days on Whitsuntide. The festival also features multiple all-night dance club parties, several fairs with medieval, gothic, and related merchandise, a variety of cultural exhibitions and performances, large themed picnics, and a number of unofficial fringe events.

With 18,000 to 20,000 regular attendants, the WGT is one of the largest events of the gothic, cybergoth, steampunk, and rivethead subcultures worldwide.

==History==

A first attempt at a &quot;Treffen&quot; was made in 1987 in Potsdam. However, as the laws of the German Democratic Republic made this kind of event illegal, only a few hundred visitors attended.

In 1992, after the re-unification of Germany, the first official Wave-Gotik-Treffen was held in the &quot;Eiskeller&quot; club (now Conne Island) in Leipzig. Since then, the number of visitors has increased greatly.

The largest installment of the WGT was the one in the year 2000 with over 300 acts and an estimated 25,000 visitors. However, that year&#x27;s festival suffered financial collapse on the third day and had to be aborted. After all festival security guards, most bands, and much of the technical staff had left, volunteer helpers and several bands who played for free staged a final concert. Contrary to police expectations, no rioting of any sort occurred.

==Description==

Over the four days of the festival, visitors are offered more than a hundred concerts and a wide range of cultural events. These include special film screenings, club parties, readings of eerie and romantic literature, exhibitions in museums and galleries, live role-playing, church concerts, medieval markets, and workshops on various topics. Visitors stay in hotels, guesthouses, or use the camping facilities at the main event site, the agra exhibition grounds, with a campsite.

In addition to the admission tickets, special &quot;Obsorge&quot; cards are sold for the Wave-Gotik-Treffen. The basic admission ticket allows access to the events and use of public transportation during the festival. Owners of an Obsorge card can also use the campsites and received the festival program book Pfingstbote for free until 2017, which is now sold separately. Until 2007, a sampler CD – Silberling – Artists of the XX Wave-Gotik-Treffen was included. The CD featured selected songs from bands performing at the festival.

A major attraction of the Wave-Gotik-Treffen is the band performances. Generally, the number of musical acts is close to 200, spanning the breadth of &quot;dark music&quot; from acoustic folk to medieval-influenced to deathrock, to dark electro, EBM, symphonic metal, gothic metal, industrial. A limited number of free tickets are also available for those officially participating in the festival to attend opera performances, classical music concerts, theatre, and ballet.


There is a shopping market in the main event venue that runs the entire duration of the festival and is perhaps the largest for the goth and &quot;dark culture&quot; community anywhere in the world. Several permanent shops in Leipzig also specialize in gothic-style clothing, shoes, and accessories, and can feature promotions during the event.

Many museums in Leipzig such as the Egyptian Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, and the Grassi Museums offer free admission or special guided tours for paid festival attendees.

In addition, there are Renaissance fairs, Viking and Pagan markets, themed picnics, Gothic Romance events, CD/DVD and film premieres, literary readings, lectures and discussions, artist signing events, brunches celebrating absinthe, and fetishistic events.

Later in the evenings there are many late-night danceclubs every night, with top-name dark music DJs, at venues such as Darkflower and Moritzbastei, as well as a dance area within the main venue itself.

Many fringe events with separate admission take place in Leipzig simultaneously with . There is an electronic music festival at NonTox, a &quot;Gothic Pogo&quot; festival, free events like Victorian and steampunk picnics and a &quot;Victorian Village&quot;, and more.

==Line-Up==

The artists performing at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen cover the entire musical spectrum of the dark scene.
Their number has increased from eight at the beginning in 1992 to nearly 350 in 2000. In 2019, there were around 200, spread across four days on parallel stages throughout the city.

==Venues==
The venues for the are spread out all over Leipzig.

The main venue is the massive 10,000-person capacity Agra fairground halls, 4.2 miles (6.75 km) south of central Leipzig. One of the two largest halls at the Agra is for the headline concerts, the other is for the main shopping market, and a third hall at the Agra houses a bistro area and a dance forum with many well-known DJs. In front of the Agra halls 1 and 2 is the &quot;promenade&quot; of the festival. The dozen-or-more additional venues for the WGT concerts and activities are as varied as the events, from the stately Schauspielhaus to the somber Krypta of the Völkerschlachtdenkmal to the Parkbühne under the trees.

Festival participants typically stay either in designated camping areas on the Agra grounds near the main venue or in the hotels and hostels in and around Leipzig. In order to stay at camping areas, participants must pay extra for an &quot;Obsorgekarte&quot;, which gives them a version of the wrist band that allows campground access.

Many food and drinks vendors set up stands in the &quot;promenade&quot; outside the Agra halls. Attendees with &quot;Obsorgekarte&quot; tickets/wristbands for camping may bring in their own food and drinks, which is otherwise restricted. Official drinks vendors use sturdy &quot;Wave Gotik Treffen&quot; branded plastic cups instead of disposable ones, for which a deposit (&quot;pfand&quot;) is required. Attendees may keep cups as souvenirs, or return them for a refund of the deposit. This arrangement greatly reduces the waste and needed cleanup of disposable containers around the venues.

==Dates==

The dates of the Wave-Gotik-Treffen vary from year to year. It is held on the German holiday weekend of , known in English as Pentecost or Whitsun. This is on the Sunday seven weeks after Easter and can range from as early as 10 May to as late as 13 June . Unofficial events start in Leipzig on the Thursday night preceding the date of , with activities such as a social gathering for English-speaking attendees and multiple dance club nights with DJs in the Agra&#x27;s bistro area as well as at local venues like Darkflower, Moritzbastei, and others. The official festival starts on Friday, and as Monday is a public holiday in Germany the events run until the end of the all-night farewell club parties in the early morning on Tuesday.

<doc id="548667" wikidata="Q314095" url="?curid=548667" title="Gordon Strachan">
<text>Gordon David Strachan ( born 9 February 1957) is a Scottish former football coach and player who is currently Technical Director of Dundee. He played for Dundee, Aberdeen, Manchester United, Leeds United and Coventry City, as well as the Scotland national team. He has since managed Coventry City, Southampton, Celtic, Middlesbrough and Scotland.

In club football, Strachan played 635 league games, scoring a total of 138 goals, playing 21 of 25 career seasons in either the English or Scottish top-flight. In international football Strachan earned 50 caps, scoring five goals and played in two FIFA World Cup final tournaments, Spain 82 and Mexico 86. Strachan retired from playing in 1997 at age 40, setting a Premier League record for an outfield player.

A right-sided midfielder, Strachan made his senior debut in 1974 with Dundee before moving on within Scotland, to spend seven seasons at Aberdeen. He first played for the Scotland national team in 1980. While at Aberdeen Strachan won multiple domestic league and cup honours in the early 1980s, as well as the 1982–83 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and 1983 European Super Cup. Moving to England, Strachan won the 1985 FA Cup final in five seasons with Manchester United. He spent the next seven seasons as club captain at Leeds, winning the 1989–90 Second Division and 1991–92 First Division league titles. He played his last game for Scotland in 1992. He moved to Coventry in 1995 for a final three seasons, as a player-coach.

Strachan became full-time manager of Coventry when the incumbent Ron Atkinson was appointed as director of football. After five years as Coventry manager, he was sacked in 2001 after the club was relegated from the top-flight for the first time in 34 years. He returned to the Premier League as Southampton manager and guided the &quot;Saints&quot; to the 2003 FA Cup final, where they lost 1–0 to Arsenal. Strachan resigned from Southampton in 2004 and took a 16-month break from management. He returned to Scotland to become manager of Celtic, where he achieved three successive league titles and other domestic cup wins. Strachan left Celtic in May 2009 after failing to win a fourth title. He then became manager of Middlesbrough in the English Championship, but left the club after an unsuccessful 12 months in the job. Strachan then managed the Scotland national team for five years, but was unable to secure qualification for a major tournament.

Strachan was named as FWA Footballer of the Year for the 1990–91 season while at Leeds. He was also named Manager of the Year in Scotland several times by writers and players while at Celtic. In 2007, Strachan was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. He is the father of Craig Strachan and Gavin Strachan and the grandfather of Luke Strachan, all of whom were also footballers.

Strachan was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1993 New Year Honours for services to association football.

==Club career==
Born and raised in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Strachan supported Hibernian as a boy. His father, Jim, worked as a scaffolder, and his mother, Catherine, worked at a whisky distillery. At age 15, he damaged his vision playing football on the school playground when a pen in his pocket became lodged in his right eye; the pen came within &quot;a thousandth of an inch&quot; of permanently costing him the vision in his eye. He was offered a contract by Hibernian manager Eddie Turnbull, but his father decided against the offer after stating the club did not pay sufficient expenses for footwear.

===Dundee===
Strachan began his career with Dundee, having decided to sign with the Scottish club at age 14. In joining the club, he rejected an approach from Manchester United, reasoning he had a better chance to establish himself in the first team at Dens Park. His natural talent was immediately apparent, and he quickly earned a reputation as an outstanding player in the second team, twice winning the Scottish Reserve Player of the Year Award. He made his mark as an 18-year-old when he outplayed Alan Ball in a friendly with Arsenal in August 1975; &quot;The Sunday Post&quot; compared him to a young Billy Bremner. Strachan became a regular player in the 1975–76 season, the inaugural season of the Scottish Premier Division, featuring in 17 of the club&#x27;s 36 league matches; however, David White&#x27;s &quot;Dee&quot; were relegated on the last day of the season after rivals Dundee United edged ahead on goal average with an unlikely draw with champions Rangers.

New boss Tommy Gemmell handed 19-year-old Strachan the captaincy for the 1976–77 First Division campaign, and he remains the youngest player to have captained Dundee. Strachan considers his performance as captain as very poor. &quot;I was a pathetic Billy Bremner. I wanted to go about bumping into people, growling at people, shouting at people. And I forgot to be a footballer.&quot; The club failed to shine in the lower divisions, and Strachan lost his first-team place early in the 1977–78 season following a drinking session with Jimmy Johnstone; Gemmell was also concerned that Strachan was &quot;getting kicked a lot&quot; after opposition teams worked out that the way to stop Dundee was to take out their playmaker. Strachan decided to leave Dundee as the club seemed unlikely to win back their top-flight status; the Dundee chairman was also keen on cashing in his most prized asset, and told Gemmell that &quot;we need £50,000 by Friday or the banks are closing the gate&quot;. His last match for Dundee was on 26 October 1977 in a 6–0 defeat in the League Cup to Queen of the South at Palmerston Park, which Strachan described in his autobiography as &quot;embarrassing&quot;.

===Aberdeen===
Strachan was signed by Aberdeen manager Billy McNeill in November 1977 for a fee of £50,000 plus Jim Shirra. Poor form and niggling injuries made 1977–78 a poor season for Strachan, though the &quot;Dons&quot; went on to finish second in the Scottish Premier Division. He was not picked for the 1978 Scottish Cup Final defeat to Rangers. Strachan did win the Scottish 2nd XI Cup with the reserves in 1978.

McNeill left the Pittodrie Stadium for Celtic in summer 1978, and Alex Ferguson was appointed as the new manager. Strachan played at Hampden Park in the 1979 League Cup defeat to Rangers, and set up Duncan Davidson for the game&#x27;s opening goal. Though the 1978–79 campaign was a disappointment, Aberdeen went on to win the league title in 1979–80 after closing a ten-point deficit over Celtic with a late run that included two victories at Celtic Park. They again reached the League Cup Final, beating both Old Firm sides &quot;en route&quot;, where they lost 3–0 to Dundee United at Dens Park. At the end of the season, Strachan was elected SFWA Footballer of the Year. After gaining assurance Alex McLeish would also stay with the club, Strachan signed a new contract to keep him at Pittodrie until 1984.

The &quot;Reds&quot; could only manage a second-place finish in 1980–81, as Celtic regained the league title. They exited the European Cup in the second round with defeat to eventual champions Liverpool; manager Bob Paisley said Strachan would become &quot;Britain&#x27;s first £2 million player&quot;, in what was a (successful) early attempt at mind games. He missed the second half of the season with a muscle tear in his stomach. With fit-again Strachan on the right flank – supported by full-back Stuart Kennedy – and record signing Peter Weir on the left-flank, Aberdeen mounted a genuine title challenge in 1981–82, but had to settle for second place to Celtic. They did though lift the Scottish Cup with a 4–1 extra-time victory over Rangers, with Strachan contributing one assist and one goal.

The 1982–83 campaign was the greatest in the history of the club, and Strachan made his mark early on with four goals in a 5–1 victory at former club Dundee in the League Cup. Despite only finishing third in the league (albeit only one point behind champions and New Firm rivals Dundee United) and exiting the League Cup in the quarter-finals, Aberdeen won the Scottish Cup and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The club&#x27;s European success came with a 2–1 after-extra-time victory over Spanish giants Real Madrid at Ullevi in Gothenburg. The Scottish Cup came with a 1–0 win over Rangers. The &quot;Dons&quot; continued their success by delivering the league title and Scottish Cup in 1983–84, with Strachan setting up Mark McGhee for the winning goal in the cup final win over Celtic. This completed a unique treble, as they defeated Hamburger SV in the 1983 European Super Cup.

===Manchester United===
In August 1984, Manchester United spent £500,000 to take Strachan to Old Trafford. However, because Strachan had previously signed a pre-contract agreement with Bundesliga side 1. FC Köln, United paid £75,000 compensation to resolve the row – teammate Mark McGhee had also signed a contract with Hamburger SV on the understanding that Strachan would also be playing in Germany. Strachan opened the 1984–85 campaign with four goals in seven matches, though the &quot;Red Devils&quot; could only manage a fourth-place finish in the First Division. He featured at Wembley Stadium in the 1985 FA Cup Final, as United ran out 1–0 winners over Everton; his lung-bursting run off-the-ball helped Norman Whiteside to find the space for his extra-time winner.

After winning their opening ten league matches of the 1985–86 season, United had to cope without Strachan, who was sidelined for much of the season with injury. They proved unable to cope with their injuries – another key player facing extended time in the treatment room was Bryan Robson – and limped to another fourth-place finish. Atkinson was replaced by Alex Ferguson in November 1986, and Strachan mocked sobbing as he told his teammates, &quot;I never thought he&#x27;d follow me this far south!&quot; After his arrival, Ferguson speculated that no longer being the star player had negatively affected Strachan&#x27;s form. United finished a disappointing 11th in 1986–87, before rising to second place in 1987–88. Strachan&#x27;s form was again patchy in 1988–89, as United slipped back down to 11th.

===Leeds United===
In March 1989, Sheffield Wednesday manager Ron Atkinson had a bid of £200,000 accepted by Manchester United, and he offered Strachan a contract paying more money than anyone in the club&#x27;s history. However likely a move to Sheffield seemed, Leeds United manager Howard Wilkinson matched the offer and convinced Strachan to drop down into the Second Division. He quickly became a popular figure at Elland Road, earning comparisons to former favourites Bobby Collins and Johnny Giles. Signing a two-year contract, he was awarded with the captain&#x27;s armband. He formed an unlikely midfield partnership with Vinnie Jones and led the club to the Second Division title in 1989–90.

With the &quot;Whites&quot; now in the First Division, Wilkinson secured a midfield quartet of Strachan, Gary McAllister, David Batty and Gary Speed. They achieved a commendable fourth-place finish in 1990–91, and also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup. Strachan was voted FWA Footballer of the Year for his performances during the campaign, becoming the first player to win the award both in Scotland and in England.

Strachan signed a new two-year contract, before captaining Leeds to the league title in 1991–92. In so doing, he denied former boss Alex Ferguson and Leeds&#x27; hated rivals Manchester United the title. However, Strachan (now nearing age 35) was beginning to feel the effects of his sciatica and missed a number of matches due to his bad back. Following the club&#x27;s success, Strachan was appointed an OBE for his services to sport.

However, Leeds were unable to build on their success, and finished the 1992–93 season down in 17th place in what was newly re-branded as the Premier League. Strachan continued to impress though, and was given the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award. He scored a hat-trick against Blackburn Rovers on 10 April 1993. This was his second hat-trick for Leeds, the first having come in September 1989 when he found the net three times in a 4–0 win over promotion rivals Swindon Town in the Second Division at Elland Road.

Strachan managed 37 starts in 1993–94, and Leeds rose to fifth. He was rarely selected in the 1994–95 season, which would prove to be the end of his spell at Elland Road, where he had spent six years.

===Coventry City===
In March 1995, Strachan moved to Coventry City to work as assistant manager under new manager Ron Atkinson, the man who had brought him south of the border to Manchester United 11 years earlier. It was also agreed he would replace Atkinson as manager in summer 1997. Strachan coached the team and led training sessions while learning the finer points of management from Atkinson. He also took to the field at Highfield Road, playing 26 Premier League matches for the Sky Blues over the next two years before finally hanging up his boots in his 40th year. Atkinson signed Aberdeen midfielder Eoin Jess in 1996 purely on the basis of Strachan&#x27;s recommendation. However, Isaías left the club after falling-out with Strachan. Coventry signed Gary McAllister for £3 million on wages of £20,000 per week; the deal was done by McAllister&#x27;s former teammate and friend Strachan, while Atkinson was largely opposed to the deal. The club struggled at the start of the 1996–97 campaign, and the club&#x27;s board of directors asked Atkinson to step aside in November 1996, some months earlier than first agreed, and Strachan was appointed manager.

==International career==
Strachan won his first cap for Scotland on 16 May 1980, in a British Home Championship defeat to Northern Ireland at Windsor Park. Strachan helped Scotland qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and scored a crucial goal in qualifying by scoring the only goal against Sweden at the Råsunda Stadium in Stockholm. He did not feature in the 1982 British Home Championship, as Jock Stein wanted to rest him for the World Cup, held in Spain. The Scots cruised to a 5–2 victory over New Zealand at La Rosaleda Stadium, Málaga; Strachan was named Man of the Match. Scotland then lost 4–1 to a world-class Brazil side at the Estadio Benito Villamarín, Seville. In the third match, a 2–2 draw with the Soviet Union back in Málaga saw Scotland exit the tournament on goal difference.

Scotland also qualified for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. However, shortly after the draw with Wales at Ninian Park on 10 September 1985, Jock Stein died of a heart attack, and his assistant Alex Ferguson took charge for the World Cup campaign. To complete their qualification, they had to beat Australia in a play-off. Strachan played in the first leg at Hampden Park, but did not travel to Melbourne for the second leg. The Scots faced a tough draw in Mexico and lost their opening match 1–0 at the Estadio Neza 86 in the Mexico City suburb of Nezahualcóyotl to the unseeded – but highly fancied – Denmark. Strachan then scored in a 2–1 defeat to West Germany at the Estadio Corregidora in Queretaro; his goal celebration was memorable, as he tried to climb the advertising hoardings, but was thwarted by his short stature and so merely rested his leg on the hoarding before he was joined by his teammates. In the third and final group match back in Nezahualcóyotl, Scotland drew 0–0 with Uruguay despite their opponents going down to ten men after less than a minute of play when José Batista attempted to take Strachan out of the game.

Strachan fell out of the first team picture under Andy Roxburgh, and was omitted from the squad for the 1990 World Cup. Nevertheless, he enjoyed a national team revival between 1990 and 1992, and captained his country in qualification for UEFA Euro 1992. However, he did not travel to Sweden as a member of the squad, as he announced his retirement due to long-term back troubles. He won 50 full caps, and scored five international goals.

==Managerial career==
===Coventry City===
When Ron Atkinson became Coventry City&#x27;s director of football in November 1996, Strachan was promoted to a player manager position. He appointed Alex Miller as his assistant. After an upturn in results, Strachan was named Manager of the Month in December. However, 1 win in 12 matches in the New Year left the &quot;Sky Blues&quot; in the relegation zone. Late wins over Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur saved their season though, and relegation was avoided by a one-point margin. Strachan played in the win over Chelsea at Highfield Road at age 40, in what was at the time a record age for an outfield player in the Premier League.

Strachan signed Swedish goalkeeper Magnus Hedman and defender Roland Nilsson, Dutch midfielder George Boateng, and Romanian striker Viorel Moldovan – all of whom would win international caps. Coventry rose to 11th place in 1997–98, and also reached the quarter-finals of the 1997–98 FA Cup. After Miller left the club, Strachan replaced him with Garry Pendrey, who would go on to spend many years as his assistant at various clubs. Strachan was again named Manager of the Month in February 1998.

The club finished 15th in 1998–99 and 14th in 1999–2000, as Strachan spent £6 million on Irish striker Robbie Keane and £5 million on Moroccans Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo, while selling Dion Dublin to Midlands rivals Aston Villa. Coventry were relegated at the end of the 2000–01 season, making Strachan unpopular with fans. New signing Craig Bellamy proved disappointing, while Robbie Keane was sold and Gary McAllister departed for Liverpool. Strachan attempted to launch a promotion campaign by signing striker Lee Hughes, but in the face of increasing supporter unrest, he was sacked five matches into the 2001–02 First Division campaign. His replacement, Roland Nilsson, took the club to an 11th-place finish.

===Southampton===
Strachan returned to management within weeks, taking the manager&#x27;s job at Premier League Southampton, who had sacked manager Stuart Gray after a terrible start to their first season at the new St Mary&#x27;s Stadium. Most pundits had already written off their survival chances by the time of Strachan&#x27;s appointment in October 2001, but he turned round their fortunes and they finished 11th in the Premier League. The Saints progressed further in 2002–03 when they finished eighth and reached the FA Cup Final, where they lost 1–0 to Arsenal. As Arsenal had already qualified for the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League, Southampton won a place in the UEFA Cup.

In February 2004, Strachan announced his resignation as Southampton manager after his decision not to stay on at the club in the summer was leaked to the press. He wanted to take a break from football, but was forced to resign earlier than initially intended due to the speculation surrounding his and the club&#x27;s future following the leak.

===Celtic===
After a 16-month break, Strachan returned to management on 1 June 2005, when he succeeded Martin O&#x27;Neill as manager of Celtic in the Scottish Premier League (SPL). For 2005–06, his stated aim was to regain the SPL title from rivals Rangers. He had an embarrassing start to his campaign as Celtic manager, losing 5–0 to Slovakian champions Artmedia Bratislava on 27 July 2005 and three days later, drawing 4–4 with Motherwell in his first SPL match in charge of the Glasgow club. The loss against Artmedia meant Celtic suffered an early exit from European competition, despite winning the return match 4–0. After this disastrous start, Celtic started to improve under Strachan. A low-point was the shock defeat in the third round of the Scottish Cup to First Division Clyde on 8 January 2006. However, the following month his team made history when they defeated Dunfermline Athletic 8–1, a record victory margin for the SPL at the time. Strachan&#x27;s first season was ultimately successful as he coached Celtic to victory in the League Cup and, on 5 April 2006, his side clinched the SPL title in record time and with six matches remaining. Reflecting this achievement, Strachan was voted Manager of the Year by the Scottish Football Writers&#x27; Association eight days later.
The following year, Strachan restructured the team and made a series of signings, bringing in players such as Hibernian&#x27;s Derek Riordan; Chelsea&#x27;s Jiří Jarošík; Kenny Miller and Lee Naylor from Wolverhampton Wanderers; Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink from PSV; Thomas Gravesen from Real Madrid; and Paul Hartley and Steven Pressley from Hearts. Celtic flourished and by mid-January 2007 held a 17-point lead in the SPL table. UEFA Champions League football again returned to Celtic Park, the team having automatically qualified for the group stages and drawn alongside Benfica, Copenhagen and Manchester United. Home victories against all three Group F members saw the team progress to the round of 16 of the Champions League for the first time since the competition was re-formatted in 1993. Celtic lost their round of 16 tie against eventual winners Milan in extra time, missing out on a place in the quarter-finals. On 22 April 2007, Strachan guided Celtic to their 41st league championship, and second in succession. A 2–1 victory against Kilmarnock left Celtic 13 points clear of Rangers with four matches remaining. Later that day, Strachan was recognised as the inaugural PFA Scotland Manager of the Year for 2007. Celtic went on to win the Scottish Cup, beating Dunfermline Athletic.

In the 2007–08 season, Strachan led Celtic into the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League again after defeating Milan, Benfica and Shakhtar Donetsk. By April, there was significant criticism from the press and the fans after a 1–0 loss to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and a 1–0 loss to ten-man Motherwell in the SPL. However, after defeating Rangers twice at home, on 22 May 2008 Strachan became only the third ever Celtic manager to guide the club to three consecutive Scottish league titles.

In the 2008–09 season, after winning the League Cup after extra time against Rangers, but failing to lead Celtic to another league title, he resigned as manager on 25 May 2009.

===Middlesbrough===
Strachan signed a four-year contract with English Championship team Middlesbrough on 26 October 2009, succeeding Gareth Southgate. He had been linked with the Middlesbrough manager&#x27;s job 15 years earlier, when still a Leeds United player. His first match in charge was on 31 October, a 1–0 defeat to Plymouth Argyle, with Adam Johnson missing a penalty. On 5 December, Middlesbrough won their first match under Strachan, 5–1 away to Queens Park Rangers. After a poor run of results, including a 3–0 loss at home to Blackpool and a 1–0 loss at home to Cardiff City, Strachan earned his first home win after his team beat Scunthorpe United 3–0.

After a poor start to the 2010–11 season meant Middlesbrough were in 20th place, Strachan left the club by mutual consent on 18 October. He voluntarily ended his contract and left without compensation.

===Scotland===
Strachan was appointed manager of the Scotland national team on 15 January 2013, succeeding Craig Levein. His first match in charge was at Pittodrie Stadium in a friendly match against Estonia on 6 February. The game ended 1–0 to Scotland, with Charlie Mulgrew getting his first international goal. Scotland suffered defeats to Wales and Serbia in Strachan&#x27;s first two competitive matches, which ended the Scots&#x27; slim chances of qualification for the 2014 World Cup. After this, Scotland had an upturn in form, winning both matches against Croatia and away against Macedonia. Scotland finished fourth in qualifying Group A.

In Euro 2016 qualifying, Scotland appeared to have a better chance of qualification as the finals tournament was expanded from 16 teams to 24, but were drawn in a tough group with Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland. After losing their opening match in Germany, Scotland recorded home wins against Georgia, Ireland and Gibraltar, and away draws against Poland and Ireland. In their following match, Scotland produced an &quot;insipid&quot; performance, as they lost 1–0 in Georgia. A home defeat by Germany left Scotland four points behind third-placed Ireland, with two matches to play. In the penultimate matches of the group, Scotland needed to beat Poland, or hope that Ireland would lose to Germany. Scotland came from behind to lead 2–1 in their match, but Ireland had scored the only goal of their match, leaving the Scots needing a win to stay alive. A late scrambled goal by Robert Lewandowski gave Poland a draw that eliminated Scotland from contention. Strachan bemoaned what he perceived to be bad luck. After a win against Gibraltar in the last qualifier, Strachan agreed to a new contract with the Scottish Football Association. After failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Strachan resigned from his position on 12 October 2017.

==Management style==
Typically playing a traditional 4–4–2 formation, and very occasionally 4–5–1, Strachan is widely known for his rigorous management style, and states that he watches video replays of his club&#x27;s matches two or sometimes three times. He also places great emphasis on player health and fitness, forbidding his players to drink alcohol excessively or regularly, and often giving dietary advice to his players, attributing his own longevity as a player to a strict and somewhat unusual diet involving seaweed. Players such as Scotland international Gary Caldwell have attributed their success at Celtic to lifestyle changes enforced by Strachan.

Renowned for his deadpan humour in media interviews, quotes attributed to Strachan have become part of popular football culture.

===Enmity with Alex Ferguson===
Despite playing for Alex Ferguson at two clubs, the pair had an ongoing public feud during Strachan&#x27;s managerial career. In his 1999 autobiography, the former Manchester United manager said, &quot;I decided this man could not be trusted an inch – I would not want to expose my back to him in a hurry.&quot; In his own 2006 autobiography, in response to Ferguson&#x27;s comments, Strachan said he was &quot;surprised and disappointed&quot;. The rivalry dates from Strachan&#x27;s time playing under Ferguson, first at Aberdeen and later Manchester United. In August 2006, after his Celtic team was drawn to play Ferguson&#x27;s Manchester United in the Champions League, Strachan said that there was no longer any enmity between the two managers.

==Other work==
Strachan has analysed football matches for the media, including alongside Adrian Chiles on BBC Sport&#x27;s &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot;. He has worked as a regular pundit for ITV&#x27;s coverage of the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. During the 2014 World Cup, he worked as a pundit for ITV. In April 2019, Strachan apologised for remarks he made during &quot;The Debate&quot; on Sky Sports. Following the release of convicted sex offender Adam Johnson from prison, Strachan had appeared to suggest that abusing Johnson for that offence was comparable with racial abuse.

For the 2006 World Cup, Strachan was appointed as the official FIFA Ambassador for Scotland, joining 50 others in fundraising for SOS Children&#x27;s Villages, the official charity of the tournament.

Strachan and his two sons started their own football school in the Coventry area in August 2009.

In July 2019, Strachan was appointed to a technical director position with Dundee.

==Personal life==
Strachan married Lesley Scott in 1977; George Mackie was his best man. Together, they had three children: Craig and Gavin Strachan, also footballers, and Gemma Strachan. Strachan&#x27;s grandson, Luke, is also a footballer and came through the youth setup with Dundee whilst Gordon was technical director at the club.

<text>Demolition Man is a 1993 American science fiction action film directed by Marco Brambilla in his directorial debut. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, Sandra Bullock, and Nigel Hawthorne. Stallone plays John Spartan, a risk-taking police officer with a reputation for causing destruction while carrying out his work. After a failed attempt to rescue hostages from evil crime lord Simon Phoenix (Snipes), they are both sentenced to be cryogenically frozen in 1996. In 2032 Phoenix escapes and the authorities awaken Spartan to help capture him. The story makes allusions to many other works including Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1932 dystopian novel &quot;Brave New World&quot; and H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeper Awakes&quot;.

The film was released in the United States on October 8, 1993, to mixed reviews from critics. It earned $159.1 million worldwide, and was considered a successful film for Stallone.

== Plot ==

In 1996, psychopathic criminal Simon Phoenix kidnaps a busload of hostages and takes refuge in an abandoned building. LAPD Sergeant John Spartan, nicknamed &quot;The Demolition Man&quot; for the large amounts of collateral damage he often causes in apprehending suspects, mounts an unauthorized assault to capture Phoenix. When a thermal scan of the area reveals no trace of the hostages, he raids the building and confronts Phoenix, who sets off explosives to destroy it. The hostages&#x27; corpses are found in the rubble, and Phoenix claims that Spartan knew about them and attacked anyway. Both men are sentenced to lengthy terms in the city&#x27;s &quot;California Cryo-Penitentiary&quot;, in which convicts are cryogenically frozen and exposed to subliminal rehabilitation techniques.

In 2032, the city of San Angeles – a megalopolis formed from the merger of Los Angeles, San Diego, and Santa Barbara – is a seemingly-peaceful utopia designed and run by Dr. Raymond Cocteau. Phoenix is thawed for a parole hearing and escapes. He makes his way into the city, where he overpowers and kills several police officers, who have never had to deal with violent crime.

Lieutenant Lenina Huxley is an idealistic SAPD officer who is fascinated with 20th-century culture. She learns about Spartan&#x27;s career from veteran officer Zachary Lamb, who suggests that their best chance to stop Phoenix is by enlisting someone with the experience and mindset to anticipate his actions. Huxley persuades her superior Chief George Earle to parole Spartan and reinstate him. Spartan finds life in San Angeles to be sterile and oppressive, since all types of behavior deemed immoral or unhealthy have been declared illegal.

Anticipating that Phoenix will attempt to secure firearms, Spartan has Huxley lead him to a museum and finds Phoenix looting an exhibit of weapons. Phoenix escapes and holds Cocteau at gunpoint but is unable to kill him, as Cocteau has altered his rehabilitation program to prevent him from doing so. Cocteau orders Phoenix to kill Edgar Friendly, the leader of the Scraps, a resistance society that lives underground.

Spartan and Huxley discover that Phoenix&#x27;s rehabilitation program was tailored by Cocteau to make him more dangerous. Phoenix persuades Cocteau to release additional cryo-prisoners, whom he leads underground to assassinate Friendly. Spartan and Huxley thwart an attempt on Friendly&#x27;s life by Phoenix, who reveals that he framed Spartan for the deaths of the 1996 hostages; they were dead before the building exploded. After Phoenix escapes to the cryo-prison, Spartan borrows weapons from the Scraps and pursues him.

Unable to harm Cocteau, Phoenix has a minion kill him, then thaws out the cryo-prison&#x27;s most dangerous convicts. After incapacitating Huxley for her safety, Spartan battles Phoenix, whom he kills by freezing him solid and then decapitating him. The uncontrolled quick-freezing effect then triggers an explosion that destroys the cryo-prison.

The police fear that the loss of Cocteau and his cryo-prison will end society as they know it. Spartan urges them and the Scraps to work together, combining the best aspects of order with personal freedom. Huxley and Spartan kiss, then depart together.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

The original script was written by Peter Lenkov, who retained a story by credit. Lenkov came to Hollywood straight out of college with no connections, and wrote seven different scripts, desperately hoping to break into Hollywood. Selling the spec script of &quot;Demolition Man&quot; to Warner Bros. was his first big break. Lenkov had been inspired by &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; and wanted to do something about cops. He was also influenced by stories of celebrities being cryogenically frozen and listening to Sting&#x27;s song &quot;Demolition Man&quot; on repeat due to a broken cassette player in his car. His initial pitch was rejected by an executive who did not understand his &quot;frozen cop&quot; idea. The finished script, where a super cop has to battle the world&#x27;s deadliest criminal, in a future where there is almost no crime, generated more interest.

Writer Daniel Waters (known for &quot;Heathers&quot;) said his version of the screenplay was essentially a rewrite; he changed the script so extensively that when the script went to arbitration he received first screenplay writing credit. In the early drafts the script was a regular action movie, with no attempt at comedy. Waters pitched it as an action movie version of Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Sleeper&quot;. Waters had an idea about a small part of Universal City, a shopping and entertainment area called CityWalk, and wondered what it might be like if one day all of Los Angeles might be like that, and the idea grew from there. Waters says his intention was to have fun, that he was not trying to be political or deeply examine political correctness. He cited the conclusion of the film, where society will need to find a new balance and compromise, as representing his own position in the political middle ground. Burger King was originally written as the winner of the restaurant wars, but they were not interested in being part of the film. McDonald&#x27;s also declined to be involved. Taco Bell welcomed the opportunity. The &quot;three seashells&quot; concept originated when Waters was trying to come up with ideas for a futuristic restroom and called writer Larry Karaszewski for suggestions, and he happened to be using the restroom when he answered the call. He looked around his bathroom and said he had a bag of seashells on the toilet as decorations, so Waters decide to use that. A joke was cut from the script, where after using the three sea shells and washing his hands Spartan was confronted by the same ineffective hand dryer from his own time. Waters wrote some of the script on index cards while waiting in line for Johnny Carson tickets. He said it was some of the fastest work he&#x27;d ever written, and that he had only worked on it for two and a half weeks.

The film began with John Spartan being taken out of cryogenic freeze in the future of 2032, until Fred Dekker did uncredited rewrites on the script, adding the Los Angeles 1996 prologue, to showcase Spartan and Phoenix in their natural environment, and make the differences of the future more striking. Dekker explained &quot;If you don&#x27;t show Kansas, Oz isn&#x27;t all that special.&quot; Jonathan Lemkin also did uncredited rewrites on the film. Steven de Souza read the script but was unavailable to commit to rewrites. De Souza recommended setting the film in the more distant future to make the culture clash more plausible. Producers rejected his suggestion because they wanted to keep the subplot of Spartan finding his daughter, but ultimately that subplot was cut from the film. The script had been in development for six years before filming finally began.

Director Marco Brambilla had a background in shooting big-budget TV commercials, and this was his first feature film. Brambilla was working to make &quot;Richie Rich&quot;, starring Macaulay Culkin, but they could not get the budget they needed. Instead David Fincher recommended Brambilla to Joel Silver as director for &quot;Demolition Man&quot;. Steven Seagal had originally been attached as leading actor, and Jean-Claude Van Damme had been offered the part of the villain. Brambilla met Stallone a few days after getting attached to the project and started re-writing the script with Daniel Waters. The film went into production approximately eight months after that. Producer Joel Silver was able to get highly experienced crew for the film, including editor Stuart Baird and cinematographer Alex Thomson. Brambilla brought costumer Bob Ringwood to the project because of his work on &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), and wanted Alex Thomson because of his work on &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992).

=== Casting ===
Stallone passed on the project at first, but came back around to it. He liked the idea of two equal opponents in Spartan and Phoenix, and decided to take a chance on doing something he had not done before. Stallone wanted Jackie Chan for the role of Simon Phoenix. Chan turned it down, not wanting to play a villain. Wesley Snipes turned down the role several times, so Joel Silver and Marco Brambilla went to the set of the film &quot;Rising Sun&quot; to try and convince him in person. Brambilla explained what he thought the film could be and his passion for the script they were writing, and the next day they received a call and Snipes agreed to do the film. Brambilla said of Snipes, &quot;He works without rehearsing too much, and he improvises a lot. The two of them, that combination of energies and the way they interact, really did the movie a lot of favors. They completely respected each other and were really professional, and they did get along. There was no ego or any competition between the actors.&quot; Lori Petty was originally cast as Huxley, but was fired after two days of filming due to what producer Joel Silver called &quot;creative differences&quot;. Petty attributed it to personality differences, as she and Stallone did not get along, and said &quot;Sly and I were like oil and water.&quot; Silver was looking for a replacement and Lorenzo di Bonaventura recommended Bullock; impressed by her audition tape, Silver hired her. Denis Leary said he was hired for his comedy rants, which he wrote himself and had to undergo a long approval process by the studio before it was included in the script.

=== Filming ===

General Motors provided the production team with 18 concept vehicles, including the Ultralite. More than 20 fiberglass replicas of the Ultralite were produced to portray civilian and SAPD patrol vehicles in the film. After filming had completed, the remaining Ultralites were returned to Michigan as part of GM&#x27;s concept vehicle fleet.
The City of L.A. allowed the filmmakers to use and demolish an old Department of Water &amp; Power building in downtown Los Angeles. This enabled them to have more control over the explosion, instead of having to cut straight to the building being gone and rubble as they had been forced to do with other projects. &quot;We actually created a crater in the middle of the building. And have the explosion and rubble more designed, so to speak. It&#x27;s fun to do that, because those big pyrotechnics always look great&quot;, Silver noted.

The film suffered repeated delays, and the original 72-day production schedule ran to 112 days. Stallone was out for a week due to injury. Heavy rains in Los Angeles delayed filming. A soundstage was also damaged in a fire. The production went through five assistant directors, and many crew had to leave to work on other projects. Insiders at Warner Bros. were critical of Silver for hiring a director without previous feature film experience. Silver rejected this view, saying, &quot;Marco&#x27;s done a brilliant job. We&#x27;re over-schedule because this is a very hard movie to make, not because Marco is inexperienced.&quot;


&quot;Demolition Man&quot; was the first production to film at the Los Angeles Convention Center after it was rebuilt in the 1990s, it was used as the Cocteau Center.
&quot;San Angeles&quot; was filmed in Orange County, California. Several locations in Irvine and San Diego were also used.
The S.A.P.D. police station in the background was the GTE Corporate Headquarters in Westlake Village, California (which later became the Baxter Healthcare building, and was used in the first episode of &quot;The Orville&quot;).
The Pacific Design Center, in West Hollywood was used for the exterior shot of Lenina Huxley&#x27;s apartment building.
The cryo-prison used the exterior of the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles. Filming also took place at Wilshire Courtyard, 5700 and 5750 Wilshire Boulevard.
A power station in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, was used as the underground dwellings of Edgar Friendly and the Scraps.
The helicopter bungee jump at the start of the film was coordinated by Charles Picerni, and performed by stuntman Ken Bates. For safety, and due to the danger of recoil back into the helicopter blades, a decelerator was used instead of a real bungee, and Bates jumped from a Chinook helicopter. According to Picerni it was a first: &quot;We&#x27;ve done that off of buildings before, but never out of a helicopter.&quot;

The film mentions Arnold Schwarzenegger having served as President of the United States, after a Constitutional amendment was passed allowing him to run for the office due to his popularity. Coincidentally, a day short of ten years after the film&#x27;s release, the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election was scheduled. The election saw Schwarzenegger actually begin a political career as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 until 2011. Shortly after he was elected, an &quot;Arnold Amendment&quot; did get proposed.

One of the film&#x27;s focal points is Taco Bell being the sole surviving restaurant chain after &quot;the franchise wars.&quot; The European version of the film substitutes Taco Bell with Pizza Hut, because Taco Bell is not as well known outside the United States and Canada; both restaurant chains were owned at the time by PepsiCo. Lines were re-dubbed and logos changed during post-production. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, this kind of localization of product placement was a first.

The film was green-lit with a production budget of $45 million. The cost increased to $77 million after the shooting schedule was extended. The combined cost of production and marketing was estimated at nearly $97 million.
A subplot involving Spartan&#x27;s daughter was cut for pacing reasons. This led to some confusion at test screenings, where audiences thought Sandra Bullock was the daughter, and reacted negatively to the scene where they were about to have sex. Originally Spartan&#x27;s daughter was one of the Scraps living underground with Edgar Friendly&#x27;s resistance. A scene where Stallone fights Jesse Ventura was cut from the film.

=== Marketing ===
MTV held a competition and demolition event to promote the film, with MTV Sports presenter Dan Cortese as host, and stars from the film in attendance. The Belknap Hardware and Manufacturing Company building in Louisville, Kentucky was imploded.
== Music ==


Elliot Goldenthal composed the score for the film. It was his second big Hollywood project after the &quot;Alien³&quot; score.

The two commercial jingles, which are not part of the soundtrack, include the jingle from the 1967 commercial &quot;Armour Hot Dogs&quot; sung by Sandra Bullock and Benjamin Bratt in the police car, and the jingle from the 1960s commercial &quot;Jolly Green Giant&quot; sung by Dan Cortese in the Taco Bell restaurant.

The theme song &quot;Love Boat&quot; of the series of the same name, which is also not part of the soundtrack, was played by Sandra Bullock as a romantic background music in her apartment before the &quot;virtual sex&quot; between her and Sylvester Stallone.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film debuted at No. 1 at the box office. &quot;Demolition Man&quot; grossed $58 million by the end of its box office run in North America and a total of $159.1 million worldwide.

Film critic Roger Ebert was asked why this film was considered a success, but &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; was considered a disappointment, despite similar budgets and box office grosses. Ebert concluded it was due to expectations, and that the film was seen as a comeback for Stallone whose career had been flagging, whereas Schwarzenegger failed to live up to his previous record breaking successes.
In 2017, Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s loan-out company filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over the disbursement of profits from the film. The lawsuit was settled in 2019.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A better-than-average sci-fi shoot-em-up with a satirical undercurrent, &quot;Demolition Man&quot; is bolstered by strong performances by Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes, and Sandra Bullock.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 34 out of 100, based on nine reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert from &quot;At The Movies&quot; reviewed the film: Siskel found the film amusing but did not care for the action sequences and gave it &quot;thumbs down&quot;, whereas Ebert enjoyed both the satirical edge this film had over other films of this genre and thought the action sequences were good for this type of film, and gave it a &quot;thumbs up&quot;.
Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film fails to give action fans what they desire, instead substituting out-of-place satirical commentary. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a significant artifact of our time or, at least, of this week&quot;. Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; wrote, &quot;Some sharp social satire is almost undermined by excessive explosions and careless casting.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized the film calling it &quot;sleek and empty as well as brutal and pointless.&quot; Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;A noisy, soulless, self-conscious pastiche that mixes elements of sci-fi, action-adventure and romance, then pours on a layer of comedy replete with Hollywood in-jokes.&quot; Levy says it &quot;works better as a comic-book adventure&quot; than did &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, but reserves his praise for the technical merits of the film, complimenting &quot;the high-tech, metallic look created by production designer David L. Snyder and his accomplished team&quot; as well as the cinematography of Alex Thomson. He concludes &quot;what&#x27;s badly missing is a guiding intelligence to lift this disjointed pic from its derivative status.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a &quot;B−&quot;. Despite his low expectations of a Joel Silver production and &quot;the everything-goes-boom school of high-tech action overkill&quot;, he found it &quot;an intermittently amusing sci-fi satire&quot; before it switches to full-tilt destruction mode. Gleiberman says &quot;if it&#x27;s the promise of overwrought violence that lures people into theaters, I suspect it will be the quieter scenes—the ones with a pretense of wit—that keep them satisfied.&quot;
Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote: &quot;Basically, &quot;Demolition Man&quot; is a futuristic cop picture with slightly more imagination and wit than the typical example of the slash-and-burn genre.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; praised the film and wrote: &quot;The pleasant surprise about &quot;Demolition Man&quot; is that both the script, and Stallone, are funny; the film blends big-budget action and tongue-in-cheek humor in the way that &#x27;Last Action Hero&#x27; tried, and failed, to do.&quot;
Phillipa Bloom of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave it 4 out of 5, and compared it to a one-night stand &quot;not necessarily something you&#x27;ll remember next day but fast, furious and damn good fun while it lasts.&quot; Bloom was critical of the thin plot but called Stallone and Snipes &quot;a dynamite screen combination&quot;.

=== Accolades ===

The film was nominated for three Saturn Awards, Best Costumes (Bob Ringwood), Best Special Effects (Michael J. McAlister, Kimberly Nelson LoCascio) and Best Science Fiction Film.
The MTV Movie Awards nominated Wesley Snipes in the &quot;Best Villain&quot; category.

Sandra Bullock was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award in the Worst Supporting Actress category.

== Legacy ==
Inspired by the film, Dennis Rodman had his hair dyed and styled the same way the character of Simon Phoenix played by Snipes, for his San Antonio Spurs debut, which was the start of Rodman dyeing his hair in different colors. Snipes hated this hairdo and shaved it off as soon as filming had wrapped.

The development of erotic games for the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset has been compared to the &quot;virtual sex&quot; scene from the film.

To celebrate the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Taco Bell recreated the 2032 San Angeles version of their restaurant at the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con.

The film has been described as a cultural touchpoint, and the restrictive future society has been used as an example of government overreach, and called a &quot;Libertarian manifesto&quot;. &quot;Demolition Man&quot; has been referred to as &quot;the only plausible dystopian vision for our time&quot;.

The film found renewed relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic; the film was seen as predictive when there were calls to end the practice of shaking hands, and shortages of toilet paper.

In the video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;, three shells are found in the bathroom of the player&#x27;s apartment.

In 2022, Sylvester Stallone reflected positively on the movie: &quot;I always enjoyed this movie. It was a great action film wonderfully directed by Marco Brambilla. And the writers were way ahead of their time.&quot;

== Sequel ==
In 1993, &quot;Us Weekly&quot; magazine reported a sequel was planned for 1995. In 2006, Stallone was asked about a sequel and he said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to make a sequel to &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, but I believe that ship has sailed and maybe there are more challenges waiting on the horizon.&quot; On May 4, 2020, Stallone said a sequel is in development.

<text>dd is a command-line utility for Unix, Plan 9, Inferno, and Unix-like operating systems and beyond, the primary purpose of which is to convert and copy files. On Unix, device drivers for hardware (such as hard disk drives) and special device files (such as /dev/zero and /dev/random) appear in the file system just like normal files; can also read and/or write from/to these files, provided that function is implemented in their respective driver. As a result, can be used for tasks such as backing up the boot sector of a hard drive, and obtaining a fixed amount of random data. The program can also perform conversions on the data as it is copied, including byte order swapping and conversion to and from the ASCII and EBCDIC text encodings.

== History ==
In 1974, the command appeared as part of Version 5 Unix. According to Dennis Ritchie, the name is an allusion to the DD statement found in IBM&#x27;s Job Control Language (JCL), in which it is an abbreviation for &quot;Data Definition&quot;. According to Douglas McIlroy, was &quot;originally intended for converting files between the ASCII, little-endian, byte-stream world of DEC computers and the EBCDIC, big-endian, blocked world of IBM&quot;; thus, explaining the cultural context of its syntax. Eric S. Raymond believes &quot;the interface design was clearly a prank&quot;, due to the command&#x27;s syntax resembling a JCL statement more than other Unix commands do.

In 1987, the command is specified in the X/Open Portability Guide issue 2 of 1987. This is inherited by IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (POSIX), which is part of the Single UNIX Specification.

In 1990, David MacKenzie announced GNU fileutils (now part of coreutils) which includes the codice_1 command; it was written by Paul Rubin, David MacKenzie, and Stuart Kemp. Since 1991, Jim Meyering is its maintainer.

In 1995, Plan 9 2nd edition was released; its command interface was redesigned to use a traditional command-line option style instead of a JCL statement style.

Since at least 1999, a native Win32 port has existed for Microsoft Windows under UnxUtils.

codice_1 is sometimes humorously called &quot;Disk Destroyer&quot;, due to its drive-erasing capabilities involving typos.

== Usage ==
The command line syntax of differs from many other Unix programs. It uses the syntax codice_3 for its command-line options rather than the more standard codice_4 or codice_5 formats. By default, reads from stdin and writes to stdout, but these can be changed by using the (input file) and (output file) options.

Certain features of will depend on the computer system capabilities, such as &#x27;s ability to implement an option for direct memory access. Sending a SIGINFO signal (or a USR1 signal on Linux) to a running process makes it print I/O statistics to standard error once and then continue copying. can read standard input from the keyboard. When end-of-file (EOF) is reached, will exit. Signals and EOF are determined by the software. For example, Unix tools ported to Windows vary as to the EOF: Cygwin uses (the usual Unix EOF) and MKS Toolkit uses (the usual Windows EOF).

The non-standardized parts of dd invocation vary among implementations.

=== Output messages ===
On completion, prints to the stderr stream about statistics of the data transfer. The format is standardized in POSIX. The manual page for GNU dd does not describe this format, but the BSD manuals do.

Each of the &quot;Records in&quot; and &quot;Records out&quot; lines shows the number of complete blocks transferred + the number of partial blocks, e.g. because the physical medium ended before a complete block was read, or a physical error prevented reading the complete block.

== Block size ==
A block is a unit measuring the number of bytes that are read, written, or converted at one time. Command-line options can specify a different block size for input/reading () compared to output/writing (), though the block size () option will override both and . The default value for both input and output block sizes is 512 bytes (the traditional block size of disks, and POSIX-mandated size of &quot;a block&quot;). The option for copying is measured in blocks, as are both the count for reading and count for writing. Conversion operations are also affected by the &quot;conversion block size&quot; ().

The value provided for block size options is interpreted as a decimal (base 10) integer number of bytes. It can also contain suffixes to indicate that the block size is an integer number of larger units than bytes. POSIX only specifies the suffixes (blocks) for 512 and (kibibytes) for 1024. Implementation differ on the additional suffixes they support: (Free) BSD uses lowercase (mebibytes), (gibibytes), and so on for tebibytes, exbibytes, pebibytes, zebibytes, and yobibytes, while GNU uses and for the same units, with , , and used for their SI unit counterparts (kilobytes). For example, for GNU , indicates a blocksize of 16 mebibytes (16777216 bytes) and specifies 3000 bytes.

Additionally, some implementations understand the character as a multiplication operator for both block size and count parameters. For example, is interpreted as 2 × 80 × 18 × 512 = , the exact size of a 1440 KiB floppy disk. This is required in POSIX. For implementations that do not support this feature, the POSIX shell arithmetic syntax of bs=$((2*80*18))b may be used.

Block size has an effect on the performance of copying commands. Doing many small reads or writes is often slower than doing fewer large ones. Using large blocks requires more RAM and can complicate error recovery. When is used with variable-block-size devices such as tape drives or networks, the block size may determine the tape record size or packet size, depending on the network protocol used.

== Uses ==
The command can be used for a variety of purposes. For plain-copying commands it tends to be slower than the domain-specific alternatives, but it excels at its unique ability to &quot;overwrite or truncate a file at any point or seek in a file&quot;, a fairly low-level interface to the Unix file API.

The examples below assume the use of GNU dd, mainly in the block size argument. To make them portable, replace e.g. with the shell arithmetic expression or (written equivalently with a bit shift).

=== Data transfer ===
 can duplicate data across files, devices, partitions and volumes. The data may be input or output to and from any of these; but there are important differences concerning the output when going to a partition. Also, during the transfer, the data can be modified using the options to suit the medium. (For this purpose, however, is slower than .)

The option means to keep going if there is an error, while the option causes output blocks to be padded.

=== In-place modification ===
 can modify data in place. For example, this overwrites the first 512 bytes of a file with null bytes:

The conversion option means do not truncate the output file — that is, if the output file already exists, just replace the specified bytes and leave the rest of the output file alone. Without this option, would create an output file 512 bytes long.

==== Master boot record backup and restore ====
The example above can also be used to back up and restore any region of a device to a file, such as a master boot record.

To duplicate the first two sectors of a floppy disk:
=== Disk wipe ===
For security reasons, it is sometimes necessary to have a disk wipe of a discarded device. This can be achieved by a &quot;data transfer&quot; from the Unix special files.

* To write &quot;zeros&quot; to a disk, use codice_6.
* To write &quot;random data&quot; to a disk, use codice_7.

When compared to the data modification example above, conversion option is not required as it has no effect when the &#x27;s output file is a block device.

The option makes dd read and write 16 mebibytes at a time. For modern systems, an even greater block size may be faster. Note that filling the drive with random data may take longer than zeroing the drive, because the random data must be created by the CPU, while creating zeroes is very fast. On modern hard-disk drives, zeroing the drive will render most data it contains permanently irrecoverable. However, with other kinds of drives such as flash memories, much data may still be recoverable by data remanence.

Modern hard disk drives contain a Secure Erase command designed to permanently and securely erase every accessible and inaccessible portion of a drive. It may also work for some solid-state drives (flash drives). As of 2017, it does not work on USB flash drives nor on Secure Digital flash memories. When available, this is both faster than using dd, and more secure. On Linux machines it is accessible via the hdparm command&#x27;s option.

The shred program offers multiple overwrites, as well as more secure deletion of individual files.

=== Data recovery ===
Data recovery involves reading from a drive with some parts potentially inaccessible. is a good fit with this job with its flexible skipping () and other low-level settings. The vanilla , however, is clumsy to use as the user has to read the error messages and manually calculate the regions that can be read. The single block size also limits the granularity of the recovery, as a trade-off has to be made: either use a small one for more data recovered or use a large one for speed.

A C program called was written in October 1999. It did away with the conversion functionality of , and supports two block sizes to deal with the dilemma. If a read using a large size fails, it falls back to the smaller size to gather as much as data possible. It can also run backwards. In 2003, a script was written to automate the process of using , keeping track of what areas have been read on its own.

In 2004, GNU wrote a separate utility, unrelated to , called . It has a more sophisticated dynamic block-size algorithm and keeps track of what has been read internally. The authors of both and consider it superior to their implementation. To help distinguish the newer GNU program from the older script, alternate names are sometimes used for GNU&#x27;s , including (the name on freecode.com and freshmeat.net), (Debian package name), and (openSUSE package name).

Another open-source program called uses a sophisticated algorithm, but it also requires the installation of its own programming-language interpreter.

=== Benchmarking drive performance ===
To make drive benchmark test and analyze the sequential (and usually single-threaded) system read and write performance for 1024-byte blocks:
* Write performance: codice_8
* Read performance: codice_9

=== Generating a file with random data ===
To make a file of 100 random bytes using the kernel random driver:
=== Converting a file to upper case ===
To convert a file to uppercase:
=== Progress indicator ===
Being a program mainly designed as a filter, normally does not provide any progress indication. This can be overcome by sending an signal to the running GNU process ( on BSD systems), resulting in printing the current number of transferred blocks.

The following one-liner results in continuous output of progress every 10 seconds until the transfer is finished, when is replaced by the process-id of : 
Newer versions of GNU support the option, which enables periodic printing of transfer statistics to stderr.

== Forks ==
=== dcfldd ===
&quot; is a fork of GNU that is an enhanced version developed by Nick Harbour, who at the time was working for the United States&#x27; Department of Defense Computer Forensics Lab. Compared to , allows more than one output file, supports simultaneous multiple checksum calculations, provides a verification mode for file matching, and can display the percentage progress of an operation. As of February 2024, the last release was 1.9.1 from April 2023.

=== dc3dd ===
&quot; is another fork of GNU from the United States Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3). It can be seen as a continuation of the dcfldd, with a stated aim of updating whenever the GNU upstream is updated. , the last release was 7.3.1 from April 2023.

<text>Ingenuus was a Roman military commander, the imperial legate in Pannonia, who became a usurper to the throne of the emperor Gallienus when he led a brief and unsuccessful revolt in the year 260. Appointed by Gallienus himself, Ingenuus served him well by repulsing a Sarmatian invasion and securing the Pannonian border, at least temporarily. Ingenuus had also been charged with the military education of &quot;Caesar&quot; Cornelius Licinius Valerianus, the young son of Emperor Gallienus, but after the boy&#x27;s death in 258, his position became perilous.

A well-liked and admired commander, Ingenuus found an opportunity to become the Roman Emperor when Valerian was captured and killed by Shapur I of the Sassanid Empire. Throwing off their allegiance to Valerian&#x27;s son, the legions of Moesia proclaimed Ingenuus Roman Emperor at Sirmium in 260. Gallienus was in Germania on the Rhine frontier, so he acted quickly by recalling troops from Gaul and after a rapid march he met Ingenuus on the battlefield at Mursa. The troops of Ingenuus were defeated, as Gallienus&#x27; general, Aureolus, used to great effect the advantage given by the mobility of an improved cavalry component of the army, which was the remarkable military innovation wanted by the Emperor.

Ingenuus died after the battle by drowning himself in a nearby river to avoid capture.

<doc id="548690" wikidata="Q854773" url="?curid=548690" title="Bhaisajyaguru">
<text>Bhaiṣajyaguru (, , , , , ), or &quot;Bhaishajyaguru&quot;, formally Bhaiṣajya-guru-vaiḍūrya-prabha-rāja (&quot;Medicine Master and King of Lapis Lazuli Light&quot;; , , , ), is the Buddha of healing and medicine in Mahāyāna Buddhism. Commonly referred to as the &quot;Medicine Buddha&quot;, he is described as a doctor who cures suffering (Pali/Sanskrit: dukkha/duḥkha) using the medicine of his teachings.

The image of Bhaiṣajyaguru is usually expressed with a canonical Buddha-like form holding a gallipot and, in some versions, possessing blue or deep green skin. Though also considered to be a guardian of the East, in most cases, Akshobhya is given that role. As an exceptional case, the honzon of Mount Kōya&#x27;s Kongōbu Temple was changed from Akshobhya to Bhaiṣajyaguru.

==Origin==
Bhaiṣajyaguru is described in the eponymous &quot;Bhaiṣajya-guru-vaiḍūrya-prabha-rāja Sūtra&quot;, commonly called the &quot;Medicine Buddha Sutra&quot;, as a bodhisattva who made twelve (12) great vows. His name is generally translated as &quot;Medicine Guru, King of Lapis Lazuli Light&quot;. &quot;Vaiḍūrya&quot; is a precious stone which most translators have rendered as lapis lazuli. Librarian Marianne Winder has proposed that &quot;vaiḍūrya&quot; originally meant beryl; however, pure beryl is colorless, while its blue variant, aquamarine, is described as a &#x27;precious blue-green color-of-sea-water stone&#x27; rather than the usual dark blue attributed to Bhaiṣajyaguru. While there is a dark blue variety of aquamarine called maxixe (pronounced mah-she-she), it is a New World gemstone — found primarily at the Maxixe Mine in the Piauí Valley near Itinga, Minas Gerais, Brazil — and was not known before 1917.

On achieving Buddhahood, Bhaiṣajyaguru became the Buddha of the eastern pure land of Vaiḍūryanirbhāsa &quot;Pure Lapis Lazuli&quot;. There, he is attended to by two bodhisattvas symbolizing the light of the sun and the light of the moon respectively:

* Sūryaprabha ()
* Candraprabha ()

The Tang Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited a Mahāsāṃghika monastery at Bamiyan, Afghanistan, in the 7th century CE, and the site of this monastery has been rediscovered by archaeologists. Birchbark manuscript fragments from several Mahāyāna sūtras have been discovered at the site, including the &quot;Bhaiṣajya-guru-vaidūrya-prabha-rāja Sūtra&quot; (MS 2385).

A Sanskrit manuscript of the &quot;Bhaiṣajya-guru-vaiḍūrya-prabha-rāja Sūtra&quot; was among the texts attesting to the popularity of Bhaiṣajyaguru in the ancient northwest Indian kingdom of Gandhāra. The manuscripts in this find are dated before the 7th century, and are written in the upright Gupta script.

== His twelve vows ==
The twelve vows of Medicine Buddha upon attaining Enlightenment, according to the Medicine Buddha Sutra are:

# I vow that my body shall shine as beams of brilliant light on this infinite and boundless world, showering on all beings, getting rid of their ignorance and worries with my teachings. May all beings be like me, with a perfect status and character, upright mind and soul, and finally attaining enlightenment like the Buddha.
# I vow that my body be like crystal, pure and flawless, radiating rays of splendid light to every corner, brightening up and enlightening all beings with wisdom. With the blessings of compassion, may all beings strengthen their spiritual power and physical energy, so that they could fulfill their dreams on the right track.
# I vow that I shall grant by means of boundless wisdom, all beings with the inexhaustible things that they require, and relieving them from all pains and guilt resulting from materialistic desires. Although clothing, food, accommodation and transport are essentials, it should be utilized wisely as well. Besides self-consumption, the remaining should be generously shared with the community so that all could live harmoniously together.
# I vow to lead those who have gone astray back to the path of righteousness. Let them be corrected and returned to the Buddha way for enlightenment.
# I vow that I shall enable all sentient beings to observe precepts for spiritual purity and moral conduct. Should there be any relapse or violation, they shall be guided by repentance. Provided they sincerely regret their wrong-doings, and vow for a change with constant prayers and strong faith in the Buddha, they could receive the rays of forgiveness, recover their lost moral and purity.
# I vow that all beings who are physically disabled or sick in all aspects be blessed with good health, both physically and mentally. All who pay homage to Buddha faithfully will be blessed.
# I vow to relieve all pain and poverty of the very sick and poor. The sick be cured, the helpless be helped, the poor be assisted.
# I vow to help women who are undergoing sufferings and tortures and seeking for transformation into men. By hearing my name, paying homage and praying, their wishes would be granted and ultimately attain Buddhahood.
# I vow to free all beings from evil thought and its control. I shall lead them onto the path of light through inculcating them with righteousness and honour so that they will walk the Buddha way.
# I vow to save prisoners who have genuinely repented and victims of natural disasters. My supreme powers will bless those who are sincere and be freed from sufferings.
# I vow to save those who suffer from starvation and those who committed a crime to obtain food. If they hear my name and faithfully cherish it, I shall lead them to the advantages of Dharma and favour them with the best food that they may eventually lead a tranquil and happy life.
# I vow to save those who suffer from poverty, tormented by mosquitoes and wasps day and night. If they come across my name, cherish it with sincerity and practice dharma to strengthen their merits, they will be able to achieve their wishes.

==Iconography==
Bhaiṣajyaguru is typically depicted seated, wearing the three robes of a Buddhist monk, holding a lapis-colored jar of medicine nectar in his left hand and the right hand resting on his right knee, holding the stem of the Aruna fruit or Myrobalan between thumb and forefinger. In the sutra, he is also described by his aura of lapis lazuli-colored light. In Chinese depictions, he is sometimes holding a pagoda, symbolising the ten thousand Buddhas of the three periods of time. He is also depicted standing on a Northern Wei stele from approximately 500 CE now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, accompanied by his two attendants, Suryaprabha and Chandraprabha. Within the halo are depicted the &quot;Seven Bhaiṣajyaguru Buddhas&quot; and seven apsaras.

==Local forms and practices==
===China===
The practice of veneration of Yaoshi (薬師佛) is also popular in China, as he is depicted as one of the three prominent Buddhas, the others being Śākyamuni and Amitabha. He can also be viewed as the healing attribute of Śākyamuni, as he is often called the &quot;Medicine King&quot; in sutras. There are two popular Chinese translations of this sutra: one by Xuanzang and the other by Yijing both translated in the Tang dynasty. The Taisho Tripitaka and Qianlong Tripitaka () each contain four translations of the sutra:

# By Srimitra in the fourth century CE (Taisho: vol. 21, no. 1331; Qianlong: no. 163).
# By Dharmagupta in 615 CE (Taisho: vol. 14, no. 449; Qianlong: no. 166)
# By Xuanzang in 650 CE (Taisho: vol. 14, no. 450; Qianlong: no. 167)
# By Yijing in 707 CE (Taisho: vol. 14, no. 451; Qianlong: no. 168)

These four versions have different titles:

# Srimitra: &quot;The Sutra on Abhiṣeka that Removes Sins and Liberates from Saṃsāra Taught by the Buddha 
# Dharmagupta: &quot;Sutra of the Vows of the Medicine Buddha&quot;
# Xuanzang: &quot;Sutra of the Vows of the Medicine Buddha of Lapis Lazuli Crystal Radiance&quot;
# Yijing: &quot;Sutra of the Vows of the Medicine Buddha of Lapis Lazuli Crystal Radiance and Seven Past Buddhas&quot; (no. 168, two scrolls).

The version translated by Yijing includes not only the vows of Yaoshi but also the vows of six other Buddhas.

Chinese Buddhists recite the mantra of Yaoshi to overcome mental, physical and spiritual sickness. The &quot;Bhaiṣajya-guru-vaiḍūrya-prabha-rāja Sūtra&quot;, which Yaoshi is associated with and described in great detail in, is a common sutra to recite in Chinese temples as well. In it, Yaoshi is described as having entered into a state of samadhi called &quot;Eliminating All the Suffering and Afflictions of Sentient Beings.&quot; From this samadhi state he spoke the Medicine Buddha dharani.

The last line of the dharani is used as Yaoshi&#x27;s short form mantra. Furthermore, much like the nianfo path of Amitabha, the name of Yaoshi is also recited for the benefit of being reborn in the Eastern Pure Lands, though this is deemphasized in favor of Yaoshi&#x27;s role for the living.

===Japan===
Starting in the 7th century in Japan, Yakushi was prayed to in the place of Ashuku (Akshobhya). Some of Yakushi&#x27;s role has been taken over by Jizō (Ksitigarbha), but Yakushi is still invoked in the traditional memorial services for the dead.

Older temples, those mostly found in the Tendai and Shingon sects, especially those around Kyoto, Nara and the Kinki region often have Yakushi as the center of devotion, unlike later Buddhist sects which focus on Amitabha Buddha or Kannon Bodhisattva almost exclusively. Often, when Yakushi is the center of devotion in a Buddhist temple, he is flanked by the , who were twelve yaksha generals who had been converted through hearing the &quot;Bhaiṣajyaguruvaiḍūryaprabharāja Sūtra&quot;:

===Tibet===
The practice of Medicine Buddha (Sangye Menla in ) is not only a very powerful method for healing and increasing healing powers both for oneself and others, but also for overcoming the inner sickness of attachment, hatred, and ignorance, thus to meditate on the Medicine Buddha can help decrease physical and mental illness and suffering.

The Medicine Buddha mantra is held to be extremely powerful for healing of physical illnesses and purification of negative karma. In Tibetan, Mahābhaiṣajya is changed to &quot;maha bekʰandze radza&quot; (མ་ཧཱ་བྷཻ་ཥ་ཛྱེ་རཱ་ཛ་) in the mantra, while &#x27;rāja&#x27; (radza) means &quot;king&quot; in Sanskrit. In modern Tibetan language, &#x27;ṣa&#x27; (ཥ) is pronounced as &#x27;kʰa&#x27; (ཁ), and &#x27;ja&#x27; in Sanskrit, as in the cases of &#x27;jye&#x27; &amp; &#x27;jya&#x27;, is historically written with the Tibetan script &#x27;dza&#x27; (ཛ). Along with other pronunciation changes, the short mantra is recited as:


One form of practice based on the Medicine Buddha is done when one is stricken by disease. The patient is to recite the long Medicine Buddha mantra 108 times over a glass of water. The water is now believed to be blessed by the power of the mantra and the blessing of the Medicine Buddha himself, and the patient is to drink the water. This practice is then repeated each day until the illness is cured.

<doc id="548695" wikidata="Q7304397" url="?curid=548695" title="Red Issue">
<text>Red Issue was a British fanzine aimed at Manchester United supporters. The fanzine was published monthly during the domestic football season since February 1989. The content of the fanzine was satirical, featuring jokes at the expense of Manchester United&#x27;s own players in addition to their rival clubs.

==Launch==
The fanzine was launched at the end of the 1980s. At the time of the launch, Alex Ferguson had failed to deliver any silverware as team manager and the club were still in a run that would eventually last 26 years without winning England&#x27;s top division league title. Other United fanzines, &quot;Red News&quot; (the first United fanzine) and &quot;United We Stand&quot;, were launched during the same late 1980s era, and remain in circulation. &quot;Red Issue&quot; remained the best-selling matchday fanzine at Old Trafford stadium from its launch until its closure.

==Issue regulars==
The fanzine contained several regular contributions, starting with the editorial comments inside the front cover reflecting on recent United performances and news.

Other regular features were:
*The Word on the Street (known as Backbeat from 1995 to 2005): Snippets of gossip regarding United, the club&#x27;s players, transfer rumours and the like. Collected by &#x27;Woodward and Bernstein&#x27; via emails from private sources amongst both mag readers and football insiders, and also from the &quot;Red Issue&quot; forum&#x27;s Sanctuary section, it was not unusual for a story to appear here before any tabloid newspapers picked up on it.
*Life of Smiley: A play on the Lightning Seeds&#x27; track &quot;The Life of Riley&quot;, a columnist&#x27;s views on United, accompanied by happy or sad smiley faces depending on the subjects in question.
*Mr. Spleen: Another regular column, usually far more critical of Manchester United and the teams&#x27; players than the editorial or Smiley.
*Boylie: the views of Peter Boyle on all things related to Manchester United.
*View from the Smoke: A regular column written by British journalist Mick Hume.

The rest of the fanzine contained articles about past team exploits, contributions from readers and often comic strips which poked fun at United&#x27;s rivals such as Manchester City (&quot;Bertie Magoo - The Bitter Blue&quot;) and Liverpool (&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;)

==Campaigns==
Proclaiming to be the &quot;Voice of the fans&quot;, &quot;Red Issue&quot; tried to influence fan campaigns throughout its history - with notable contributions in the defeat of an attempted takeover of the club by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s BSkyB and attempts to block the Glazer takeover.

Green &amp; Gold - Till They Die Or Fold/Till the club is sold was a campaign by some of the &quot;Red Issue&quot; faithful led by forum leader Chatmaster.

After Manchester United claimed an historic 19th league title, the &quot;Red Issue&quot; fanzine was behind the unveiling of a banner at arch-rivals Liverpool&#x27;s home stadium Anfield, taunting opposition fans with their league titles record having been toppled.

==Website==
The &quot;Red Issue&quot; website ran in conjunction with the fanzine, containing links to the online forum. The website carried the same satirical tone to the fanzine itself, and advertised it on many pages. The online news bulletins from the &quot;Red Issue&quot; management stopped on 1 December 2007. The paywalled website continued after the closure of the fanzine, under the sole direction of the fanzine&#x27;s final editor, who also controlled the &quot;Red Issue&quot; Twitter account, which made its final post on 31 July 2021.

<doc id="548696" wikidata="Q739138" url="?curid=548696" title="Teen pop">
<text>Teen pop is a subgenre of pop music that is created, marketed and oriented towards preteens and teenagers. Often, the artists themselves are teenagers during their breakout. While it can involve influences from a wide array of musical genres, it remains a subset of commercial pop, focusing on catchy melodies and marketability. Teen pop’s lyrics emphasize themes that teenagers can relate to, such as love, growing up, or partying. The image of the artist as an aspirational or desirable teenage figure is a crucial element of the genre, highlighting their visual appeal.

Despite facing criticism for being perceived as inauthentic or overly commercial, teen pop has remained a defining genre in the music industry. Today, it continues to dominate commercial markets with artists such as Olivia Rodrigo and Tate McRae. The genre&#x27;s popularity can be attributed to teenagers&#x27; disposable income, which they often devote to purchasing singles, albums, and merchandise. The impact of the teen pop genre extends beyond the music industry into culture, influencing fashion, language, and social trends. Teenage fans often develop a parasocial relationship with their idols, believing that the artist cares about them and their fellow fans. The intense connection between teen pop artists and their young audiences has had a profound effect on the psychological nature of teenagers, shaping their self-image and cultural identity.

== Characteristics ==
Structurally, teen pop may include influences from a variety of other genres, such as R&amp;B, rock, electronic, or hip hop. Usually, it includes catchy repeated chorus lines, Auto-Tuned or pitch-corrected vocals, and upbeat melodies.

Appealing to adolescents, the lyrical content of teen pop usually involves themes teenagers can or aspire to relate to, such as young love, partying, high school social hierarchies, and often incorporate sexual innuendo. An element of visual appeal is integral to teen pop, with teen idols usually being an object of desire or aspiration to their fans, often by cultivating an image of being a girl/boy next door. Stylish fashion, popular hairstyles, and choreographed dance crazes are important commercial elements of teen pop.

According to AllMusic, teen pop &quot;is essentially dance-pop, pop, and urban ballads&quot; that are marketed to teens, and was conceived in its contemporary form during the late 1980s and 1990s, pointing out the late 1990s as &quot;arguably the style&#x27;s golden era.&quot; About.com&#x27;s Bill Lamb described teen pop sound as &quot;a simple, straightforward, ultra-catchy melody line [...] The songs may incorporate elements of other pop music genres, but usually they will never be mistaken for anything but mainstream pop. The music is designed for maximum focus on the performer and a direct appeal to listeners.&quot;

In &quot;Crazy About You: Reflections on the Meanings of Contemporary Teen Pop Music&quot; (2002), Phillip Vannini and Scott M. Myers write that teen pop songs &quot;are targeted to youths presumably unaware and unconcerned with the problems of everyday society. Youths are symbolized as mainly in growing up while having a good time.&quot; Some authors deemed teen pop music as &quot;more disposable, less intellectually challenging, more feminine, simpler and more commercially focused than other musical forms.&quot; In &quot;Music Scenes: Local, Translocal and Virtual&quot;, author Melanie Lowe wrote that teen pop &quot;is marked by a clash of presumed innocence and overt sexuality, a conflict that mirrors the physical and emotional turmoil of its primary target audience and vital fan base: early-adolescent middle-and upper middle-class suburban girls.&quot;

== Background ==
Teen pop has a rich and evolving history that extends beyond its commercial success.  Characterized by its simple, catchy melodies and mainstream appeal, teen pop has been a staple of the Music industry since the 1940s, with artists like teen idol Frank Sinatra paving the way. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the late 1980s and early 1990s that the genre experienced a significant resurgence, coinciding with the widespread use of the term &quot;Teen Pop&quot; to describe this particular style of music.

 This revival came after a period of decline in the late 1970s and early 1980s when teen-oriented pop faded due to the rising popularity of Punk rock and Disco. Disco becoming popular from the United States&#x27; city nightlife scene, and punk rock from its lyrics focus on themes of rebellion against Authority and the Establishment. Nevertheless, the early 2000s marked a peak in pop dominance, with teen pop becoming even more popular. Artists like Britney Spears became iconic figures, influencing not only music but also fashion trends of the 2000s.

== History ==
=== 20th century ===
Teen-oriented popular music had become common by the end of the swing era, in the late 1940s, with Frank Sinatra being an early teen idol. However, it was the early 1960s that became known as the &quot;golden age&quot; for pop teen idols, who included Paul Anka, Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Lulu and Ricky Nelson. During the 1970s, one of the most popular preteen and teen-oriented acts was the Osmonds, where family members Donny and Marie both enjoyed individual success as well as success as a duo apart from the main family (Donny also recorded with his brothers as the Osmonds).

The first major wave of teen pop after the counter-culture of the 1960s and 1970s occurred in the mid to late 1980s, with artists such as Menudo, New Edition, the Jets, Debbie Gibson, Tiffany, Martika, New Kids on the Block and Kylie Minogue. In the early 1990s, teen pop dominated the charts until grunge and gangsta rap crossed over into the mainstream in North America by late 1991. Teen pop remained popular in the United Kingdom with the boy band Take That during this period, until the mid-1990s when Britpop became the next major wave in the UK, eclipsing the style similar to how grunge did in North America.
In 1996, British girl group Spice Girls released their debut single &quot;Wannabe&quot;, which made them major pop stars in the UK, as well as in the US the following year. In their wake, other teen pop groups and singers rose to prominence, including Hanson, the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, Robyn, All Saints, S Club 7, Five, B*Witched, and Destiny&#x27;s Child. In 1999, the success of teenaged pop singers Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore marked the development of what AllMusic refers to as the &quot;pop Lolita&quot; trend, sparking the short careers of upcoming pop singers such as Willa Ford, Brooke Allison, Samantha Mumba, Jamie-Lynn Sigler, Mikaila, Amanda, Nikki Cleary and Kaci Battaglia. 
In 2001, artists like Aaron Carter, Swedish group A-Teens, girl groups 3LW, Play, Eden&#x27;s Crush and Dream and boy bands O-Town, B2K and Dream Street were teen pop artists who achieved success. In Latin America, successful singers and bands appealing to tweens and teens were Sandy &amp; Junior, RBD and Rouge.
According to Gayle Ward, the demise of this late 1990s teen pop was due to:
*promotional oversaturation of teen pop music in the early 2000s;
*the public&#x27;s changing attitude toward it, deeming teen pop as inauthentic and corporately produced;
*the transition of the pre-teen and teenage fanbase of these teen pop artists during 1997–1999 to young adulthood (and the accompanying changes in musical interests);
*a growing young adult male base classifying the music, especially boy band music, as effeminate, and
*other musical genres began increasing in popularity.

1990s and early 2000s teen pop artists eventually entered hiatuses and semi-retirements (*NSYNC, Dream, Destiny&#x27;s Child) or changed their musical style, including the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore, 3LW and Aaron Carter. Many teen artists starting incorporating genres such as pop rock, contemporary R&amp;B and hip-hop. B2K were a hip hop/pop/R&amp;B group consisting of four teenage black boys, and were considered a boy band, though they were only active from 2000 to 2004. Their style of music was very different from other teenage artists, sounding more mature than the typical boy band, though all members were in their mid-teenage years at the time.

=== 21st century ===
In the mid to late 2000s, teenage singers such as Rihanna and Chris Brown achieved success, indicating new relevance of teen-oriented pop music.

In 2005, AKB48 was created to promote idol culture and Japanese pop nationwide and overseas followed by the expansion of sister groups and rival groups locally and internationally over the years. In 2016, SNH48, as AKB48&#x27;s second international sister group, announced its local Chinese sister groups like BEJ48, GNZ48, SHY48 and CKG48 to integrate idol culture with a Chinese twist.

The emergence of Canadian singer Justin Bieber created a renewed interest in teen pop, especially of the traditional male teen idol. With the release of his debut seven-track EP &quot;My World&quot; on December 5, 2009, he became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut album chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Since his debut, Bieber has played a key role in influencing modern popular culture and has sold over 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time.

In 2010, the creation of Ark Music Factory helped contribute a new generation of teen pop artists via the Internet, such as Rebecca Black and Jenna Rose, despite major criticism with these artists due to the excessive use of auto-tune. As for Japanese teen pop culture, the category of &quot;idol&quot; was playing an important role. Momoiro Clover Z is ranked as number one among female idol groups according to 2013–2017 surveys.

In 2013, New Zealand singer/songwriter Lorde dominated the teen pop mainstream, with her debut studio album Pure Heroine. The album&#x27;s lead single Royals became a viral sensation. Lorde topped &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s list of most influential teenagers. 

By the late 2010s, K-pop artists such as BTS and Blackpink, attained international stardom in teen pop culture. Having sold over 4.7 million copies, &quot;Map of the Soul: 7&quot; by BTS is the all-time best-selling album in South Korea. BTS is the first Asian and non-English-speaking act to be named International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year (2020). The group was featured on &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s international cover as &quot;Next Generation Leaders&quot; in 2018 and are recognised as the &quot;Princes of Pop&quot;.

Other noteworthy artists include Taylor Swift, an influential figure in contemporary teen pop music, emerged onto the scene as a teenage country artist in the mid-2000s and progressively transitioned to mainstream pop. She quickly became one of the most influential and highest-grossing artists of her generation with multiple Grammy Awards, best-selling album sales, and record-breaking hits. On top of her musical achievement, Taylor Swift also has an immense cultural impact as she has been a vocal advocate for artists’ rights within the music industry. By leveraging the power of her commercial success and undefiable fan support, Taylor Swift constructed a solid platform to denounce injustices regarding the value of creative labour in the digital age. She has been especially instrumental in the reform of policies concerning the fair compensation of artists on music streaming services. Taylor Swift is regarded as “not only a highly successful artist but as an emblematic figure whose very success validates the potential of old-industry structures to both challenge and adapt to the demands of a new economic environment.” Swift continues to push boundaries and redefine the pop landscape in monumental ways.

One Direction, a British-Irish boy band that formed on the UK version of ‘The X Factor’ in 2010 is the most profitable boy band of all time. Composed of members Liam Payne, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, Harry Styles, and Zayn Malik. The group swiftly rose to colossal stardom after its debut and eventually became synonymous with the global trend of teen pop culture in the early 2010s, a phenomenon deeply rooted in the age of Twitter. One Direction’s fame ignited a fan frenzy among their predominantly female fan base to a magnitude such that it has been compared to the “Beatlemania” era of the 1960s. Building on the craze of the American boy bands of the 1990s and early 2000s of NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, and later the Jonas Brothers, the One Direction teen idols redefined the concept of the boy band and its legitimacy by shedding the image of the manufactured idol and embracing their authenticity. They created a new wave of the boy band genre that directly contributed to the emergence of other artists such as 5 Seconds of Summer. Despite their indefinite hiatus in 2015, One Direction has a cemented place in the annals of pop music history and its members continue to pursue solo music careers.

In the 2020s, singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo has dominated the teen pop scene. Emerging as a teenage Disney star, she swiftly transitioned into pop music to draw from her personal experiences to weave narratives of love, heartbreak and self-exploration. Rodrigo’s rise to fame can be attributed to her prominence on platforms such as TikTok, where she became viral after releasing her first single “Drivers License” in 2021.

<text>Newton Heath is an area of Manchester, England, north-east of Manchester city centre and with a population of 9,883.

Historically part of Lancashire, Newton was formerly a farming area, but adopted the factory system following the Industrial Revolution. The principal industry in the area became engineering, although many were employed in the mining and textiles industries in the thriving areas of Clayton Vale and Bradford.

Newton included what is now Miles Platting and it stretched to Failsworth. It was bounded by brooks and rivers on all four sides – the River Medlock, Moston Brook, Newton Brook and Shooters Brook. With the creation of Miles Platting the remainder of Newton became known as Newton Heath.

Manchester United has strong links with the area, having been formed from the Newton Heath Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Football Club.

==History==
All Saints Church

Newton Chapel, later becoming the Parish Church of All Saints Newton Heath began as early as 1556, a time of great turbulence religious upheaval (Mary 1st, King Henry VIII daughter was on the throne), the inhabitants being mainly Puritan in their sympathies. It was built of wattle and daub; the first of some 8 Chapels of Ease under the Manchester Collegiate Church (MCC), the nearest other Chapel of Ease being at Gorton (later at St James). Lands owned at Newton formed part of the historic estates of the MCC.

Newton Chapel stood on a wild heath, on the highest ground and on the site of the ancient Roman Road from Chester to Manchester (this road is what is now Briscoe Lane, Gaskell Street and on a straight line through to Roman Road, Failsworth), and on to York, at its junction with the roads connecting the townships of Moston and Droylsden. Close by is the road linking the townships of Manchester, Failsworth and Oldham.

Newton Chapel was rebuilt in 1598 and an old timber found in the rubble when rebuilding in 1814, was found to have a date of 1556 carved upon it, thus 1556 being the probable date of the first building.

The first permanent Curate at Newton Chapel (All Saints), was appointed in 1598, those before 1598 being clergy sent from the Manchester Collegiate Church. This 1598 chapel was built of oak stanchions and small branches, plastered with mud, and whitewashed. The gallery was reached by a stone stairway on the outside of the building. The floor of the chapel was bare earth, and being of clay was very cold. Rushes were strewn over the floor in winter, brought in by rush carts. There were stocks close to the chapel for the use of male offenders, and from the centre of the gallery projected a circular stall where female offenders were made to stand through services as penance.

In 1738, the mud walls were replaced by brick, and interior repairs were carried out. In 1795 the building was declared unsafe as a place of worship. On Sunday 1 May 1808 an anniversary service was held in the chapel and the next morning at 6.00am, the building finally collapsed. Apparently it had been repaired some 4 years earlier and the reason for the final collapse was said to be that the repairs had been made in the winter season. Services continued amidst the dereliction, as no effort towards rebuilding was made for another 5 years.

The present neo-classical gothic building of 1814 was built to a design by William Atkinson, architect, of Manchester. An Act of Parliament authorised £3500 (equivalent to approximately £280,000 as of November 2020), to be raised by church rates on the chapelry property, and a supplementary Act authorised a further £3300 (£250,000 - so in total £530,000), and pews were rented out to raise further money, The cracked bell from the old building was moved, to the new chapel of 1814 and in 1860 a new bell was installed. To show how exceptional All Saints Church is, please read below the Architects career, and it shows All Saints was his only design that was his from start to finish.
The building was extended by a chancel in 1879, a gift of John Taylor of Brookdale Hall, in memory of his wife, Anne. It was adorned with an alabaster reredos completed in 1881 with fine alabaster carved panels. The church underwent major re-reordering in the late 1960s, work that probably would not be granted permission these days. Portions of the north and south galleries were removed at the east end of the nave, pews removed, a nave altar installed; choir and clergy stalls removed from the chancel to the nave; the pulpit was removed and buried in the churchyard. The nave vault and galleries were painted monochrome replacing the Victorian polychromatic scheme. This has been described by Historic England as &quot;heritage crime&quot;. The building is currently on the &quot;At Risk Register&quot; of Listed Buildings maintained by Historic England. Granted by Faculty, in 1980, the church received a mid-14th century font which arrived from Covenham St Bartholomew, near Louth, Lincs.

French Huguenots settled in the area in the 16th century to avoid continental persecution, and brought cotton and linen weaving and bleaching skills with them. The arrival of textile mills saw Newton Heath&#x27;s cottage industry change forever into a fully mechanised mass production system – in 1825 Newton Silk Mill (which exists to this day) was built and the Monsall Silk Dye Works followed soon afterwards.

The Rochdale Canal made movement of raw materials and finished products a practical reality. Later came other industries, including a soap works, Elijah Dixon&#x27;s match manufacturing factory, and rope works as well as engineering and glass making works. Many small back-to-back low cost houses were built to house the new migrant work force. Thus was Newton changed irrevocably from a farming area into an industrial one.

The 18th century saw Oldham Road (A62) turnpiked and a toll bar installed at Lambs Lane; this road still forms the main artery through the district. With the Industrial Revolution, by the beginning of the 19th century the Rochdale Canal had been constructed and this brought industry and creeping urbanisation to the district. During the 19th century the local population increased nearly 20 fold.

From 10 February 1883 until the slum clearances of the 1970s there was a Salvation Army corps on Thorp Road.

===Industrial history===
Newton Heath was home to a number of famous companies such as Mather &amp; Platt, who established a vast engineering works producing pumps, electrical machinery and fire sprinkler systems. The aircraft manufacturer Avro was also based in Newton Heath before relocating to sites at Chadderton and Woodford. Another local engineering company was Heenan &amp; Froude, who designed and manufactured the structural steelwork for Blackpool Tower.

P. Frankenstein and Sons Ltd., a manufacturer of experimental rubberized fabrics and supplier of life vests to the Royal Air Force, had their head offices at Victoria Rubber Works, Culcheth lane on Stansfield street. The company also owned its RFD Beaufort Ltd division in Birkenhead.

The Wilson&#x27;s &amp; Co brewery on Monsall Road was founded in 1834. The company merged with rival brewer Walker &amp; Homfrays in 1949. Wilson&#x27;s and its estate of tied houses were acquired by Watney Mann in 1960. Wilson&#x27;s brewery closed in 1987 when production was moved to Webster&#x27;s Brewery, Halifax.

===Manchester United===
The parish was the birthplace of the Newton Heath Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Football Club which was established in 1878 and later became Manchester United. It began life as a football team formed by Frederick Attock a Liverpudlian, who was a superintendent engineer of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR). The team played on a pitch at North Road, and were initially outfitted in green and gold jerseys. By 1892, they had been admitted to the Football League. The club remained in the area until 1893, when it moved to new premises at Bank Street in nearby Clayton. The name was changed to Manchester United Football Club in 1902.

Newton Heath FC&#x27;s biggest successes prior to the name change, were its election to the First Division on its expansion in 1892 and winning the Lancashire Cup in 1898.

===FC United of Manchester===
Ten Acres Lane was the proposed site of a new 5,000-capacity stadium for F.C. United of Manchester which the club intended to move into in time for the start of the 2012–13 season.

Manchester City Council gave planning permission for the stadium on 25 November 2010. However, due to local government funding cuts, the project was halted at the planning stage. Manchester City Council were forced to review their offer and the existing Ten Acres Lane site is now to be developed for other purposes. F.C. United instead moved into a partnership arrangement with Moston Juniors Football Club, building a new stadium, Broadhurst Park, in nearby Moston in 2015.

==Governance==
An exclave known as Kirkmanshulme was part of the district. Belle Vue stands on that land, which is now only remembered in Kirkmanshulme Lane which borders it. The district was incorporated into the city of Manchester in 1890.

Newton Heath is in the parliamentary constituency of Manchester Central alongside Manchester city centre, Hulme, Beswick, Clayton, Openshaw and Moss Side. As of 2012, the seat is held by the Labour Party Member of Parliament, Lucy Powell. As of 2016, the local councillors are June Hitchen, John Flanagan and Carmine Grimshaw who are Labour Party members.

==Geography==
Newton Heath is an urban area surrounded by Clayton, Monsall, Moston, Failsworth, Miles Platting, Bradford and Ancoats, south of the A62 (Oldham Road), the main road between Oldham and Manchester city centre.

To the south is Clayton Vale, a former centre of industry; the land has since become a rural wilderness.

==Economy==
The town has several well-known businesses, although a number of companies have since relocated to other areas or disbanded. Princes Food &amp; Drink Group has a soft drinks factory on Grimshaw Lane. Manchester Abattoir, on Riverpark Road, was the primary source of meat produce for the city but has gradually downsized over recent years. The central bakery of Martins Bakery is on Holyoak Street.

The town&#x27;s main shopping area is on Church Street, where alongside small family-run stores there are also branches of Iceland, Asda and Lidl. The local market, once a local attraction, is now closed after a doomed attempt to upgrade the facilities led to the regular clientele finding other pitches.

==Landmarks==
Two prominent landmarks are Philips Park and cemetery and Brookdale Park. Brookdale Park was formed in 1904 and spans over . The park has two bowling greens, tennis courts, and a children&#x27;s play centre. Philips Park was opened on 22 August 1846 at a cost of £6,200 and was the first public park opened in Manchester. The park, covering , was named after Mark Philips MP who was committed to creating parks for the use of the working people of the city.

All Saints church is the oldest remaining structure in the area and can trace its history back to 1556.

Culcheth Hall, which stood alongside the River Medlock in Newton, was owned by the Byron family (of which the poet Lord Byron was a member). Other great houses once lay within the district, including Clayton Hall (owned by the Greaves family), Whitworth Hall and Hulme Hall.

==Transport==
Railways arrived in Newton Heath during the 1840s and the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR) laid two main lines across the district. Steam locomotive repair sheds were opened in 1877 at the Newton Heath Motive Power Depot (now Traction Maintenance Depot), coded 26A by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. These grew to become a major local employer which, by the 1860s, had been expanded to a site with over 2,000 workers.

Both Newton Heath (closed on 3 January 1966) and Park railway stations (closed on 27 May 1995) were deemed by British Rail to be surplus to requirements following the decline of the local engineering industry.

Newton Heath is served by Newton Heath and Moston Metrolink station. It is located adjacent to the Newton Heath depot, which maintains diesel unit trains for Northern. Metrolink trams have served the area since 2012 using the Manchester-bound platform of the previous Dean Lane railway station. The line was converted from heavy rail to light rail operation as part of the Metrolink expansion project. A £35.6 million Metrolink station was built in 2005 at Central Park south of Newton Heath in anticipation of the network extension, but the project was cancelled by the Government due to funding problems until confirmation of the Metrolink conversion in 2007.

The majority of bus routes are operated by stagecoach manchester. Buses 74, 76 and 83 offer from Manchester city centre, via Oldham. Bus 171 offers from Newton Heath, via Withington Hospital. Bus 172 offers from Newton Heath, via Chorlton-cum-Hardy. Bus 184 offers from Huddersfield, via Manchester city centre. Bus 396 offers from Newton Heath, via Ashton-under-Lyne.

==Education==
There are four primary schools, catering for children aged between 3 and 11. There are no secondary schools or facilities for further education in the area. The nearest secondary school is St Matthew&#x27;s RC High School.

==Religious sites==
==Sport==
Newton Heath Cricket club, which was established in 1859, is located on Mabel Street and affiliated with the Manchester &amp; District and the Lancashire Cricket Associations.

Ten Acres Astro Centre is a council-run sport centre with a full-size outdoor AstroTurf pitch (marked for football and hockey) and an indoor sports hall (marked out for netball, basketball, volleyball, five-a-side football, and badminton).

A speedway training track operated in Newton Heath in the early 1950s.

==Public services==
Policing in Newton Heath is provided by Greater Manchester Police, with a part-time station on Silk Street under the command of North Manchester (A) Division.

Newton Heath Library is on Old Church Street. It lends books and DVDs, and offers public computing facilities. The building is also used for a regular &quot;Councillors&#x27; Surgery&quot; and children&#x27;s group.

Waste management is co-ordinated by the local authority via the &quot;North Manchester Household Waste and Recycling Centre&quot; which is the primary refuse depot for north Manchester.

==Notable people==
Notable people of note who were either born and raised in the town include:

The area has produced a number of notable footballers who has distinguished careers in both the national and international game. Jimmy Collinson played for Newton Heath F.C.; George Lydon, Nobby Lawton, Cyril Barlow, Harold Hardman, played for Manchester United; Charlie Harrison played for the Bolton Wanderers; Ron Staniforth, who played in the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, was born in the town and went on to play 107 games for Sheffield Wednesday. More recently, former Manchester United footballer Ronnie Wallwork and Blackpool F.C. Nathan Eccleston all came from Newton Heath.

==Cultural references==

In 1943, L. S. Lowry painted a picture of workers walking to the Mather &amp; Platt&#x27;s stainless steel foundry entitled &quot;Going to Work&quot;. Commissioned by the War Artists Advisory Committee, the picture is now owned by the Imperial War Museum.

<text>Mankind is a discontinued massively multiplayer online real-time strategy (MMORTS) computer game.

== Gameplay ==
Equipped with one construction unit, a &quot;Vibz&quot;-type starship, and a small amount of credits, players start out in a guarded star system (&quot;Imperial system&quot;) to eventually create their own empire. Typical first steps in &quot;Mankind&quot; consist of building a small base on one of the nearby planets and mining available resources which could either be sold or used to construct further units. Later, a player can leave the safety of the Imperial systems behind and colonize his own star system.

=== Environments ===
Planet surfaces as well as the space in star systems are realized as separate two-dimensional square game maps, called &quot;environments&quot; in game jargon. While space maps have borders, planetary maps are virtually borderless - units leaving the map at the eastern border reappear in the west, those leaving in the north reappear in the south. Each environment can contain player units and installations. Some restrictions exist, such as land vehicles only being able to operate on planetary maps, or specific starships not being able to enter planetary environments. Only one environment per player can be active at a time. Players can switch between maps by loading the unit content of a new environment, thereby leaving the old one.

=== Game universe ===
The game takes place in the so-called &quot;Mankind galaxy&quot;. The galactic map available for navigation is divided into sectors of space (&quot;cubes&quot; in game jargon), each of which might contain between zero and about 25 stars. Each star system contains between 5 and 8 planets. Early game reviews talked about a total sum of 900 million available planets, each with their own climate, seasons and population, a figure that was repeated in advertising text on the game box and even topped by the official website, which claimed several million systems and billions of planets.

In fact, a majority of these planets and star systems were unavailable (&quot;closed&quot;) at the initial release of the game and have never been opened afterwards. During the two game resets since its release, the layout of the Mankind galaxy was changed and its size reduced. The last released galaxy consists of 73,251 star systems with 476,265 planets.

The persistent universe feature means that even when players are not involved in the game their mines extract ore, factories create equipment, ships continue commerce, and combat units continue to do battle. The game also has option to allow the user be notified via cell phone text message if their units came under attack.

==Development==
&quot;Mankind&quot; was initially published in December 1998 by the French computer game developer Vibes Online Gaming. After the transfer of Vibes to its Asian partner, the game was bought by O2 Online Entertainment Ltd., it is being primarily maintained by Quantex Online Entertainment since 2008.

Estimates of the number of active players are hard to come by - while the official site claimed both 145,000 and &quot;more than 200,000&quot; players on the same page, these figures likely included inactive as well as trial accounts. According to an interview with an O2OE spokesman, barely 3,000 accounts were active in May 2003.

During the game rework of Quantex in early 2009, the graphic engine of &quot;Mankind&quot; was fully ported to DirectX 9 and full support for Windows Vista implemented. Further, dozens of small improvements were implemented.

In December 2015 the &quot;Mankind&quot; servers were shut down.

A newer version of the game, named Unity Space Conquest, is based on the original Mankind.

<text>Gottfried Münzenberg (17 March 1940 – 2 January 2024) was a German physicist. 

==Life and career==
Gottfried Münzenberg was born on 17 March 1940, into a family of Protestant ministers (father Pastor Heinz and mother Helene Münzenberg). All his life he was deeply concerned about the philosophical and theological implications of physics. He studied physics at Justus-Liebig-Universität in Giessen and Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck and completed his studies with a Ph.D. at the University of Giessen, Germany, in 1971. In 1976, he moved to the department of nuclear chemistry at GSI in Darmstadt, Germany, which was headed by Peter Armbruster. He played a leading role in the construction of SHIP, the &#x27;Separator of Heavy Ion Reaction Products&#x27;. He was the driving force in the discovery of the cold heavy ion fusion and the discovery of the elements bohrium (&quot;Z&quot; = 107), hassium (&quot;Z&quot; = 108), meitnerium (&quot;Z&quot; = 109), darmstadtium (&quot;Z&quot; = 110), roentgenium (&quot;Z&quot; = 111), and copernicium (&quot;Z&quot; = 112). In 1984, he became head of the new GSI project, the fragment separator, a project which opened new research topics, such as interactions of relativistic heavy ions with matter, production and separation of exotic nuclear beams and structure of exotic nuclei. He directed the &quot;Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Chemistry&quot; department of the GSI and was professor of physics at the University of Mainz until he retired in March 2005.

Among the rewards he received should be mentioned the Röntgen-Prize of the University of Giessen in 1983 and (together with Sigurd Hofmann) the Otto Hahn Prize of the City of Frankfurt am Main in 1996.

Münzenberg died in Greifswald on 2 January 2024, at the age of 83.

<doc id="548709" wikidata="Q3538361" url="?curid=548709" title="Thirteen Buddhas">
<text>The is a Japanese grouping of Buddhist deities, particularly in the Shingon and Tendai sects of Buddhism. The deities are, in fact, not only Buddhas, but also include bodhisattvas. In Shingon services, lay followers recite a devotional mantra to each figure, though in Shingon practice, disciples will typically devote themselves to only one, depending on what the teacher assigns. The chanting of the mantras of the Thirteen Buddhas is a basic practice followed by Shingon and Tendai lay followers. They are also important in funeral and apotropaic / protective rituals.

== Funeral rituals ==

The Thirteen Buddhas are also an important part of a traditional Japanese Buddhist funeral service, with each deity having a corresponding memorial service for the deceased. The names of the thirteen figures are given below in Japanese and Sanskrit and the corresponding date of their service after the death:

# Fudō (Acala), 7th day
# Shaka (Sakyamuni), 14th day
# Monju (Manjushri), 21st day
# Fugen (Samantabhadra), 28th day
# Jizō (Ksitigarbha), 35th day
# Miroku (Maitreya), 42nd day
# Yakushi (Bhaisajyaguru), 49th day
# Kannon (Avalokitesvara), 100th day
# Seishi (Mahasthamaprapta), 1st anniversary
# Amida (Amitabha), 2nd anniversary
# Ashuku (Akshobhya), 6th anniversary
# Dainichi (Vairocana), 12th anniversary
# Kokūzō (Akasagarbha), 32nd anniversary

==Mantras==
While the thirteen figures have several mantras associated to each respectively, those listed below pertain to the standard formula used in Japanese ritual. The Shingon and Tendai schools each use a different method of transliteration of the original Sanskrit. Bhaisajyaguru is the only figure whose mantra fundamentally differs between traditions.

<text>The City of Manchester Stadium, currently known as Etihad Stadium for sponsorship reasons, is the home of Premier League club Manchester City, with a domestic football capacity of 53,600, making it the 7th-largest football stadium in England and 11th-largest in the United Kingdom.

Built to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the stadium has since staged the 2008 UEFA Cup final, England football internationals, rugby league matches, a boxing world title fight, the England rugby union team&#x27;s final group match of the 2015 Rugby World Cup and summer music concerts during the football off-season.

The stadium, originally proposed as an athletics arena in Manchester&#x27;s bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, was converted after the 2002 Commonwealth Games from a 38,000 capacity arena to a 48,000 seat football stadium at a cost to the city council of £22 million and to Manchester City of £20 million. Manchester City agreed to lease the stadium from Manchester City Council and moved there from Maine Road in the summer of 2003.

The stadium was built by Laing Construction at a cost of £112 million and was designed and engineered by Arup, whose design incorporated a cable-stayed roof structure and supported entirely by twelve exterior masts and cables. The stadium design has received much praise and many accolades, including an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 2004 for its innovative inclusive building design and a special award in 2003 from the Institution of Structural Engineers for its unique structural design.

In August 2015, a 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed, in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season. A £300 million redevelopment programme of the existing North Stand entailing the construction of a new hotel with 400 rooms, covered fan park for 3,000 people and increased net capacity to approximately 61,000 commenced in July 2023 and is projected to be completed by the end of 2026.

==History==

===Background===

Plans to build a new stadium in Manchester were formulated before 1989 as part of the city&#x27;s bid to host the 1996 Summer Olympics. Manchester City Council submitted a bid that included a design for an 80,000-capacity stadium on a greenfield site west of Manchester city centre. The bid failed and Atlanta hosted the Games. Four years later the city council bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, but this time focusing on a brownfield site east of the city centre on derelict land that was the site of Bradford Colliery, known colloquially as Eastlands. The council&#x27;s shift in focus was driven by emerging government legislation on urban renewal, promising vital support funding for such projects; the government became involved in funding the purchase and clearance of the Eastlands site in 1992.

For the February 1993 bid the city council submitted another 80,000-capacity stadium design produced by design consultants Arup, the firm that helped select the Eastlands site. On 23 September 1993, the games were awarded to Sydney, but the following year Manchester submitted the same scheme design to the Millennium Commission as a &quot;Millennium Stadium&quot;, only to have this proposal rejected. Undeterred, Manchester City Council subsequently bid to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games, once again proposing the same site along with downsized stadium plans derived from the 2000 Olympics bid, and this time were successful. In 1996, this same planned stadium competed with Wembley Stadium to gain funding to become the new national stadium, but the money was used to redevelop Wembley.

After successful athletics events at the Commonwealth Games, conversion into a football venue was criticised by athletics figures such as Jonathan Edwards and Sebastian Coe as, at the time, the United Kingdom still lacked plans for a large athletics venue due to the capability of installing an athletics track having been dropped from the designs for a rebuilt Wembley Stadium. Had either of the two larger stadium proposals developed by Arup been agreed for funding, then Manchester would have had a venue capable of being adapted to hosting large-scale athletics events through the use of movable seating.

Sport England wished to avoid creating a white elephant, so they insisted that the City Council agree to undertake and fund extensive work to convert the venue from a track-and-field arena to a football stadium, thereby ensuring its long-term financial viability. Sport England hoped either Manchester City Council or Manchester City F.C. would provide the extra £50 million required to convert the stadium to a 65,000-seater athletics and footballing venue with movable seating. However, Manchester City Council did not have the money to facilitate movable seating and Manchester City F.C. were lukewarm about the idea. Stadium architects Arup believed history demonstrated that maintaining a rarely used athletics track often does not work with football – and cited examples such as the Stadio delle Alpi and the Olympic Stadium with both Juventus and Bayern Munich moving to new stadiums less than 40 years after inheriting them.

===2002 Commonwealth Games===
The stadium&#x27;s foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Tony Blair in December 1999, and construction began in January 2000. The stadium was designed by Arup and constructed by Laing Construction at a cost of approximately £112 million, £77 million of which was provided by Sport England, with the remainder funded by Manchester City Council. For the Commonwealth Games, the stadium featured a single lower tier of seating running around three sides of the athletics track, and second tiers to the two sides, with an open-air temporary stand at the northern end; initially providing a seating capacity for the Games of 38,000, subsequently extended to 41,000 through the installation of additional temporary trackside seating along the east and south stands.

The first public event at the stadium was the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games on 25 July 2002. Among the dignitaries present was Queen Elizabeth II who made a speech, delivered to her in an electronic baton, and &#x27;declared the Commonwealth Games open&#x27;. During the following ten days of competition, the stadium hosted the track and field events and all the rugby sevens matches. Sixteen new Commonwealth Games track and field records (six men&#x27;s and ten women&#x27;s) were set in the stadium. Prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London, the 2002 Games was the largest multi-sport event ever to be staged in the United Kingdom, eclipsing the earlier London 1948 Summer Olympics in numbers of teams and competing athletes (3,679), and it was the world&#x27;s first multi-sport tournament to include a limited number of full medal events for elite athletes with a disability (EAD). In terms of number of participating nations, it is still the largest Commonwealth Games in history, featuring 72 nations competing in 281 events across seventeen (fourteen individual and three team) sports.

===Stadium conversion===

Sections of the track were removed and relaid at other athletics venues, and the internal ground level was lowered to make way for an additional tier of seating, on terracing already constructed then buried for the original configuration. The three temporary stands with a total capacity of 16,000 were dismantled, and replaced with a permanent structure of similar design to the existing one at the southern end. This work took nearly a year to complete and added 23,000 permanent seats, increasing the capacity of the converted stadium by 7,000 to approximately 48,000. Manchester City F.C. moved to the ground in time for the start of the 2003–04 season. The total cost of this conversion was in excess of £40 million, with the track, pitch and seating conversion being funded by the city council at a cost of £22 million; and the installation of bars, restaurants and corporate entertainment areas throughout the stadium being funded by the football club at a cost of £20 million. The Games had made a small operating surplus, and Sport England agreed that this could be reinvested in converting the athletics warm-up track adjacent to the main stadium into the 6,000 seat Manchester Regional Arena at a cost of £3.5 million.

===Stadium expansion===
The stadium is owned by Manchester City Council and leased by the football club on a &#x27;fully repairing&#x27; basis. All operating, maintenance and future capital costs are borne by the club, who consequently receive all revenues from stadium users. The 2008 takeover made the football club one of the wealthiest in the world, prompting suggestions that it could consider buying the stadium outright. Manchester City signed an agreement with Manchester City Council in March 2010 to allow a £1 billion redevelopment led by architect Rafael Viñoly.

During the 2010 closed season the football pitch and hospitality areas were renovated, with a £1 million investment being made in the playing surface so that it is better able to tolerate concerts and other events without damage. In October 2010, Manchester City renegotiated the stadium lease, obtaining the naming rights to the stadium in return for agreeing to now pay the City Council an annual fixed sum of £3 million where previously it had only paid half of the ticket sales revenue from match attendances exceeding 35,000. This new agreement occurred as part of a standard five-year review of the original lease and it amounts to an approximate £1 million annual increase in council revenues from the stadium.
During 2011–14, the club sold all 36,000 of its allocated season tickets each season and experienced an average match attendance that is very close to its maximum seating capacity (see table in subsequent section). Consequently, during the 2014–15 season, an expansion of the stadium was undertaken. The South Stand was extended with the addition of a third tier which, in conjunction with an additional three rows of pitch side seating, increased stadium capacity to approximately 55,000. Construction commenced on the South Stand in April 2014 and was completed by the start of the 2015–16 season.

===Future plans===
A final phase of expansion, which received planning approval at the same time as the others, will add a matching third tier of seats to the North Stand. In November 2018, the club consulted with season ticket holders on possible alternative configurations for this expansion, including proposals for a still larger two-tier North Stand without executive boxes or corporate hospitality lounges, and possibly with areas convertible to safe standing. The full length of the second tiers in the East and West stands will then be reconfigured as premium seating associated with new hospitality bar areas. This final phase will bring the stadium&#x27;s total seating capacity up to approximately 62,000, making the Etihad Stadium the nation&#x27;s fourth largest capacity club ground, after Old Trafford, the London Stadium and the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

Eventually, a £300 million redevelopment programme of the existing North Stand was approved in April 2023. It entails the construction of a new hotel, covered fan park for 6,000 people and increased net capacity to 61,474 (allowing for seats blocked off for fan separation), with construction expected to commence in 2023 and be completed by the summer of 2025. The second tier at the north end of the stadium will be extended with a further 7,900 seats; while a &#x27;Skybar&#x27;, linked to the hotel and with premium seating for 450, will surmount the whole.
==Architecture==

When planning the development, Manchester City Council required a sustainable landmark structure that would be an icon for the regeneration of the once heavily industrialised site surrounding Bradford Colliery, as well as providing spectators with good sightlines in an &quot;atmospheric&quot; arena. Arup designed the stadium to be &quot;an intimate, even intimidating, gladiatorial arena embodying the atmosphere of a football club&quot; with the pitch six metres below ground level, a feature of Roman gladiatorial arenas and amphitheatres. The attention to detail, often absent in stadium design, has been remarked upon, including the cigar-shaped roof supports with blue lighting beacons, sculpted rainwater gutters, poly-carbonate perimeter roof edging and openable louvres to aid pitch grass growth with similarities also made to high-tech architecture.

===Roof design===
The toroidal-shaped stadium roof is held together by a tensioned system, which has been described as &quot;ground-breaking&quot; by &quot;New Steel Construction&quot; magazine. The stadium&#x27;s architectural focal point is the sweeping roof and support masts which are separate from the concrete bowl. A catenary cable is situated around the inner perimeter of the roof structure which is tied to the masts via forestay cables. Backstay cables and corner ties from the masts are connected to the ground to support the structure. With the expansion of the South Stand in 2015 to accommodate a third tier of seating, the original south end roof was dismantled; but with the southern masts and corner ties remaining, so as to continue to tie the catenary cable which now runs below the new roof. The new higher South Stand roof is a separate structure, with its own set of braced masts and cables; and it is expected that a counterpart arrangement will be adopted for the proposed North Stand expansion.

Cables are attached to the 12 masts circling the stadium with rafters and purlins for additional rigid support. The cigar-shaped masts double as visual features, with the highest at . Access to the upper tiers of seats is provided by eight circular ramps with conical roofs resembling turrets above which eight of the twelve masts rise up providing the support structure for the roof.

The roof of the south, east and west stands built for the athletics stadium configuration was supported by the cable net system. The temporary open stand at the north end was built around the masts and tie down cables that would ultimately support the roof of the North Stand. After the games the track and field were excavated. The temporary bleachers at the north end were removed and the North Stand and lower tier of seats constructed on the prepared excavation. The North Stand roof was completed by adding rafters, purlins and cladding.

===Facilities and pitch===
The stadium has facilities for players and match officials in a basement area below the west stand, which also contains a kitchen providing meals for up to 6,000 people on match days, press rooms, ground staff storage, and a prison cell. The stadium also has conference facilities and is licensed for marriage ceremonies. Fitting out of the hospitality suites, kitchens, offices, and concourse concessions was accomplished by KSS Architects, and included the installation of the communications cabling and automatic access control system.

The stadium&#x27;s interior comprises a continuous oval bowl, with three tiers of seating at the sides, and two tiers at each end. Entry by patrons is gained by contactless smart card rather than traditional staffed turnstiles. The system can admit up to 1,200 people per minute through all entrances. A service tunnel under the stadium provides access for emergency vehicles and the visiting team&#x27;s coach to enter the stadium directly. Once inside the stadium patrons have access to six themed restaurants, two of which have views of the pitch, and there are 70 executive boxes above the second tier of seating in the north, west and east stands. The stadium is equipped with stand-by generators should there be an electrical mains failure. These are capable of keeping the stadium electrics running as well as the floodlights at 800 lux, the minimum level stipulated by FIFA to continue to broadcast live football.

To create the optimum grass playing surface in the stadium bowl, the roof was designed to maximise sunlight by using a ten-metre band of translucent polycarbonate at its periphery. Additionally, each of the corners of the stadium without seating have perforated walls with moveable louvres that can be adjusted to provide ventilation of the grass and general airflow through the stadium. Drainage and under-pitch heating were installed to provide optimum growing conditions for the grass. The pitch has a UEFA standard dimension of . and is covered with natural grass reinforced by artificial fibres made by Desso. The field of play is lit by 218 2000-watt floodlights, consuming a total of 436,000 watts. The grass playing surface is recognised as being one of the best in English football, and has been nominated five times in the last nine seasons for best Premier League pitch, an accolade it won in 2010–11 among other awards.
==Names==

The stadium was named the City of Manchester Stadium by Manchester City Council before construction began in December 1999, but has a number of commonly used alternatives. City of Manchester Stadium is abbreviated to CoMS when written and spoken. Eastlands refers to the site and the stadium before they were named SportCity and CoMS respectively, and remains in common usage for both the stadium and the whole complex, as does SportCity but with less frequency. The stadium was also officially referred to as Manchester City Stadium for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The football club, under its new ownership, renegotiated its 250-year lease with the city council in October 2010, gaining the naming rights in return for a substantial increase in rent. The stadium was renamed the Etihad Stadium by the club in July 2011 as part of a ten-year agreement with the team kit sponsors Etihad Airways. The agreement encompasses sponsorship of the stadium&#x27;s name, extends the team kit sponsorship for ten years, and relocated the club&#x27;s youth academy and training facilities to the City Football Academy onto the Etihad Campus development across the road from the stadium.
Despite being a continuous oval bowl, each side of the stadium is named in the manner of a traditional football ground. All sides were initially named by compass direction (North Stand and South Stand for the ends, East Stand and West Stand for the sides). In February 2004, after a vote by fans, the West Stand was renamed the Colin Bell Stand in honour of the former player. The vote was almost cancelled (and the stand instead named after Joe Mercer) due to suspicions it had been hijacked by rival fans who wished to dub the renamed stand The Bell End. However, core supporters of the club made it clear they still wished the stand named after their hero. The East Stand is unofficially known by fans as the Kippax as a tribute to the very vocal east stand at the club&#x27;s Maine Road ground.

The North Stand is the only part of the stadium built after the Commonwealth Games, during the stadium&#x27;s conversion. The temporary unroofed north stand it replaced had been dubbed the New Gene Kelly Stand by supporters, a reference to the unroofed corner between the Kippax and the North Stand at the club&#x27;s former Maine Road home, because, being exposed to the elements, they frequently found themselves &quot;singing in the rain&quot;. Commencing season 2010–11, seating in the North Stand has been restricted to only supporters accompanied by children, resulting in this end of the ground now being commonly referred to as the Family Stand. Although the North Stand has never been officially renamed and is still frequently referenced that way, most external ticketing offices and stadium guides, in addition to the club itself, now preferentially label and refer to this section of the ground as the Family Stand when discussing seating and ticket sales. Supporters initially dubbed the South Stand the Scoreboard End (the former name of the North Stand at Maine Road), and it houses the majority of City&#x27;s more vocal fans. Supporters of visiting teams are also normally allocated seats in this stand, as it has ready access from the visitor supporter coach park. From 2003 to 2006, the South Stand was renamed the Key 103 Stand for sponsorship reasons, though this was largely ignored by regular patrons. The November 2018 consultation exercise on further expansion options envisages the North Stand then becoming the Home End, with no corporate hospitality areas, a greatly extended second tier, &quot;affordable&quot; ticket prices and possible areas capable of conversion to safe standing. The singing area would then be in the North Stand, and the Family Stand would be relocated elsewhere in the Stadium.
==SportCity==

The stadium is the centrepiece of SportCity, which includes several other nationally important sporting venues. Adjacent to the stadium is the Manchester Regional Arena, which served as a warm-up track during the Commonwealth Games and is now a 6,178-capacity venue that hosts national athletics trials, but has previously also hosted the home games of both the Manchester City women&#x27;s team and the club&#x27;s under-21 reserve team. The Regional Arena has regularly hosted the AAA Championships and Paralympic World Cup, and is currently the home ground of amateur rugby league side Manchester Rangers.

The National Squash Centre and the National Cycling Centre, which includes both the Manchester Velodrome and the National Indoor BMX Arena, are all a short distance from the stadium. The Squash Centre, which has hosted the British National Squash Championships since 2003 was added to the SportCity complex for the Commonwealth Games along with CoMS. The Velodrome, another showpiece venue used to stage all the track cycling events for the Games, was already in place and had been home to British Cycling, the governing body for cycling in Britain, since it was built in 1994, as part of Manchester&#x27;s unsuccessful 2000 Olympics bid. Prior to the completion of the Lee Valley VeloPark for the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Velodrome had been the only indoor Olympic-standard track in the United Kingdom. The collocated BMX Arena houses the United Kingdom&#x27;s only permanent indoor BMX track and provides seating for up 2,000 spectators. It was added to the National Cycling Centre at SportCity in 2011.

Other major sporting and sport-related venues located in SportCity in the immediate vicinity of the Etihad Stadium, all legacies of the 2002 Commonwealth Games are the English Institute of Sport, west of the stadium, adjacent to the southwest corner of the Regional Arena; the Manchester Regional Tennis Centre, adjacent to the north end of the stadium; and the Manchester Tennis &amp; Football Centre, also adjacent to the stadium, which is operated and administered by the Manchester Sport and Leisure Trust.

===Public sculpture===

Between 11 March (Commonwealth Day) and 10 August 2002, as part of the preparations for the upcoming Commonwealth Games and to celebrate Her Majesty the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, a national Spirit of Friendship Festival was organised. On 9 July, a few weeks before the Games began, a sculpture outside the new national headquarters of the English Institute of Sport at SportCity was unveiled by the middle-distance runner Steve Cram. This sculpture, commissioned in late 2001, was created in a little over eight weeks by Altrincham-based artist, Colin Spofforth, who had submitted to Manchester City Council his idea for a heroic-sized sculpture of a sprinter as a means of celebrating the beauty, power and determination of the competing athletes. Reaching thirty feet high, weighing seven tonnes, and titled &quot;The Runner&quot;, this unique larger-than-life bronze statue of a male sprinter surmounting a bronze globe was, at the time, the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest sporting sculpture. It depicts the very moment the runner leaves the blocks once the starter&#x27;s gun has fired.

From 2005 to 2009 a Thomas Heatherwick sculpture, &quot;B of the Bang&quot;, was situated to the southeast of the stadium at the junction of Ashton New Road and Alan Turing Way. Built after the Commonwealth Games to commemorate them, it was the tallest sculpture in the United Kingdom. However, numerous structural problems led to the 184 ft. sculpture being dismantled in 2009 for safety reasons. In 2014, money recovered by the Manchester City Council as a result of lengthy legal battles consequent to this debacle was used to fund a new £341,000 public sculpture a few hundred yards further south.

Across 2021 and 2022, Manchester City unveiled outside the stadium three statues designed by Andy Scott of players crucial to the team&#x27;s first Premier League title in 2011–12. First came a pair of defender Vincent Kompany and striker David Silva, and one year later one of striker Sergio Agüero recreating his celebration after scoring the &quot;93:20&quot; goal.
==Stadium firsts==

The first public football match at the stadium was a friendly between Manchester City and Barcelona on 10 August 2003. Manchester City won the game 2–1, with Nicolas Anelka scoring the first ever goal in the stadium.

The first competitive match followed four days later, a UEFA Cup match between Manchester City and Welsh Premier League side Total Network Solutions, which City won 5–0 with Trevor Sinclair scoring the first competitive goal in the stadium. Having started the Premier League season with an away match, Manchester City&#x27;s first home league fixture in the new stadium was on 23 August, a game drawn 1–1 with Portsmouth, with Pompey&#x27;s Yakubu scoring the first league goal in the stadium, and David Sommeil being the first City player to score here in the league.

2011–12 saw the Etihad Stadium play host to the setting of a number of new club and Premier League footballing records, such as the club becoming the first ever team to win 11 of its opening 12 games in a Premier League season, and going on to remain unbeaten at the Etihad Stadium in all 19 of the Premier League games played there. The club&#x27;s record of 55 home points out of a possible 57 at the stadium is a joint best Premier League record, and the club&#x27;s record of twenty consecutive home wins at the stadium (going back to the end of the previous season) also set a new Premier League record in March 2012.
The record football attendance at the stadium not involving its host team Manchester City is 43,878, which was set at the 2008 UEFA Cup final game between Zenit Saint Petersburg and Rangers on 14 May 2008. As is customary for such games, the then 47,715 maximum physical capacity of the stadium had been reduced by UEFA to around 44,000 for this final. However, neither limit would have been able to accommodate the vast number of supporters of the Scottish club, estimated to be in excess of 130,000, that travelled down from Glasgow to Manchester on the day of the game, despite the club&#x27;s official ticket allocation being just 13,000 and police requests for fans without tickets to stay home. This order of magnitude mismatch between the numbers of travelling fans and those holding tickets ultimately led to a serious public disorder incident in the centre of the city now inextricably associated with this final, despite the fact that the 44,000 or so crowd who watched the game inside the stadium were perfectly well-behaved.

==Reception==
The 2002 Commonwealth Games were deemed a success and the stadium gained critical acclaim for its atmosphere and architectural design. It has won a number of design awards, including the 2004 Royal Institute of British Architects Inclusive Design Award for inclusive building design, the 2003 Institution of Structural Engineers Structural Special Award, and in 2002 a BCI Major Project high commendation was awarded by the British Construction Industry. In July 2014, the stadium was declared one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s five most iconic structures by the Construction Industry Training Board.

In 2003, initial reception by Manchester City supporters was polarised, with some lukewarm about moving from Maine Road which had a reputation for being one of English football&#x27;s most atmospheric grounds, whilst others were enthusiastic about the bigger stadium and move back to East Manchester where the club was formed. Since 2010, the club has boasted more than 36,000 season ticket holders each season, which is more than the 35,150 maximum capacity of Maine Road just before the club moved homes.

In a 2007 Premier League survey of fans of each club, the proportion of Manchester City fans assessing their sight lines as &#x27;very good&#x27; was the second highest in the Premier League, after the Emirates Stadium. Opposition fans have generally given positive feedback, with CoMS coming second to Old Trafford in a 2005 poll to find the United Kingdom&#x27;s favourite football ground. In 2010, the City of Manchester Stadium was the third most visited stadium after Old Trafford and Anfield by overseas visitors.

In the early years of Manchester City&#x27;s tenure, the stadium suffered from a poor atmosphere, a common problem with newly-opened stadia when compared with traditional football grounds such as Maine Road. In the 2007 Premier League survey, the proportion of Manchester City fans assessing match atmosphere as &#x27;very good&#x27; was the second lowest in the Premier League, better only than Middlesbrough&#x27;s Riverside stadium. The more recent expansion of capacity has been designed with improved atmosphere as a specific objective. Though not based on facts, the stadium is nicknamed &#x27;Emptyhad&#x27; by rival fans in reference to poor game-day attendance and atmosphere.

In October 2014, the club received two national VisitFootball awards for the quality of its customer care of Premier League fans visiting the Etihad Stadium during the previous season. VisitFootball, a joint venture between the Premier League and the national tourism board&#x27;s VisitEngland, has been assessing the care that patrons receive at football grounds since August 2010, and presents annual awards for those clubs who deliver outstanding customer service. Manchester City had been one of the first four clubs to receive an inaugural VisitFootball award in 2011, but in 2014 it was the recipient of both the Club of the Year and Warmest Welcome awards. According to the panel of experts from the football and customer service industries that assess the services and facilities provided at each of the twenty Premier League club stadia, &quot;Manchester City are the gold standard in providing fans with the best matchday experience.&quot;
==Etihad Campus==
===Etihad Campus and CFA===

In July 2011, the venue was renamed the Etihad Stadium, sponsored by Etihad Airways who fought off competition from Ferrostaal and Aabar to gain the stadium naming rights. The lucrative 10-year sponsorship deal included not just the naming rights to the stadium itself but to the whole Etihad Campus, a £200 million complex of football-related facilities into which it would be incorporated. In mid-September 2011, development plans were duly announced for a new state-of-the-art youth academy and training facility, now known as the City Football Academy (CFA) to be built on derelict land adjacent to the stadium and which would include a 7,000-capacity mini-stadium plus 15 additional outdoor football pitches, six swimming pools and three gyms. The planned CFA facility was not only to become the new home base of the Manchester City first team squad, reserve (under-21 youth) team squad, and all of the Academy younger age group squads, but also the new home of the prior loosely affiliated Manchester City Ladies team (which was re-branded in 2012 as Manchester City Women&#x27;s F.C. and more formally merged into the Manchester City family of affiliated football teams). Also fully integrated into the new CFA facility would be the parent club&#x27;s world headquarters.

At the beginning of March 2014, the structural framework for a new pedestrian walkway/footbridge over the junction of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road connecting the CFA with the Etihad Stadium was lowered into place. With sponsor Suisse Power &amp; Gas SA having subsequently secured the naming rights, the completed SuisseGas Bridge was officially opened and turned over to Manchester City Council for general public access on 26 November 2014. Twelve days later, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, presided over the official opening of the CFA.

===Community outreach/urban regeneration===
As part of Manchester City&#x27;s commitment to community outreach in their redevelopment plans for the areas of East Manchester adjacent to the Etihad Stadium, other urban regeneration plans incorporated into the overall Etihad Campus development project include the new £43 million Beswick Community Hub, that includes Connell Sixth Form College; a community leisure centre (with swimming pool, dance studio, health and fitness gym, rugby pitch, and grass sports pitches); and a planned Manchester Institute of Health and Performance. On 26 November 2014, the same day the SuisseGas Bridge was officially opened, a &quot;globally admired&quot; grouping of stainless steel sculptures, consisting of three towering metallic chess pieces called &quot;Dad&#x27;s Halo Effect&quot; by its internationally acclaimed creator, Ryan Gander, was likewise unveiled to the public. Commissioned by the Manchester City Council to represent both the past industrial and current sporting heritage of this area of east Manchester, the public artwork is located in front of the Connell Sixth Form College, close to the central circus of the Beswick Community Hub, and only a few hundred yards south from where the area&#x27;s last public sculpture, &quot;B of the Bang&quot;, had been situated.
==Transport==

The stadium is 2.5 km east of Manchester city centre. Manchester Piccadilly railway station, which serves mainline trains, is a 20-minute walk away along a well-lit, signposted route that is supervised by stewards close to the ground. Piccadilly station also has a Metrolink tram stop (in the undercroft); from which regular trams along the East Manchester Line to Ashton-under-Lyne serve the stadium and Etihad Campus, with enhanced service frequencies and doubled tram units on matchdays. The Etihad Campus tram stop close to Joe Mercer Way to the immediate north of the stadium opened in February 2013, and handles several thousand travellers each matchday; spectators travelling by tram from Manchester city centre being able to board services at Piccadilly Gardens, the journey taking approximately 10 minutes. The Velopark tram stop also opened in February 2013 and provides access to the southeastern approach to the stadium, as well as closer access to other areas of SportCity such as the Manchester Velodrome and the City Football Academy.

There are many bus routes from the city centre and all other directions which stop at, or close to, SportCity. On match and event days special bus services from the city centre serve the stadium. The site has 2,000 parking spaces, with another 8,000 spaces in the surrounding area provided by local businesses and schools.
==Other uses==


Under the terms of its lease, the stadium is able to host non-football events such as concerts, boxing and rugby fixtures at Manchester City&#x27;s prerogative. Manchester City applied for a permanent entertainment licence in 2012 in a bid to expand the number of non-footballing events at the stadium.

===Concerts===
Outside the football season, the stadium hosts annual summer concerts, and is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest music venues, having a maximum capacity of 60,000 for performances. It was the largest stadium concert venue in England before the new Wembley Stadium was built.

The first concert was a performance by the Red Hot Chili Peppers supported by James Brown in 2004. An Oasis concert at the ground was featured on the DVD, &quot;Lord Don&#x27;t Slow Me Down&quot; and the band&#x27;s concert in 2005 set the attendance record of 60,000. Take That released a DVD of their 2006 performance at the stadium, &quot;Take That: The Ultimate Tour&quot;. Other artists who have played the stadium are U2, Beyoncé, Jay-Z, George Michael, Rod Stewart, Foo Fighters, Pet Shop Boys, Manic Street Preachers, Bastille, Dizzee Rascal, The Futureheads, the Sugababes, Taylor Swift, Metallica, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Coldplay, Bruce Springsteen, Muse, Bon Jovi (three times), Robbie Williams, One Direction, The Stone Roses and the Spice Girls. It also hosted Liam Gallagher for his homecoming gig in 2022.

Concerts and boxing matches eventually took their toll on the pitch. In 2008, late post-concert pitch renovation, combined with an early start to the football season, led to the pitch not being ready for the first home fixture, causing the club to play its UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley&#x27;s Oakwell Stadium and a moratorium to be imposed on the staging of non-football events at Eastlands. In May 2010, the club invested in a new pitch and summer concerts resumed in 2011 when Take That played eight nights, with ticket sales totalling approximately 400,000.

===Other football events===
The City of Manchester Stadium has hosted several major football matches in addition to Manchester City&#x27;s home fixtures. It became the fiftieth stadium to host an England international football match when the English and Japanese national teams played on 1 June 2004. In June 2005, the stadium hosted England&#x27;s opening game in the UEFA Women&#x27;s Championship, setting an attendance record of 29,092 for the competition. The stadium also hosted the 2008 UEFA Cup final, in which Zenit Saint Petersburg defeated Rangers 2–0.

In May 2011, the stadium hosted the Conference National play-off final between AFC Wimbledon and Luton Town; Wimbledon gained promotion to the Football League after beating Luton in a penalty shoot-out. The stadium was used for the play-offs because the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final was due to take place at Wembley on 28 May 2011 and UEFA regulations stipulate the stadium hosting the Champions League final must not be used for other matches during the previous two weeks.

===Other sports===
In October 2004, the stadium played host to a rugby league international match between Great Britain and Australia in the Tri-Nations series in front of nearly 40,000 spectators.
The stadium also hosted the Magic Weekend for three consecutive seasons (2012–2014). After a record attendance in 2012 – both for a single day (32,953) and the aggregate for the whole weekend (63,716) – the Etihad Stadium became the venue of choice for this annual rugby league event, setting another attendance record (36,339/64,552) for it in May 2014. However, construction work involved with the expansion of the South Stand caused it to be relocated to St. James&#x27; Park, Newcastle, for summer 2015.

On 24 May 2008, Stockport born and twice IBF and IBO light welterweight champion boxer Ricky Hatton defeated Juan Lazcano in a contest billed as &quot;Hatton&#x27;s Homecoming&quot;. The fight was held in front of 56,337 fans, setting a record attendance for a British boxing event post World War II.

On 10 October 2015, the stadium hosted a 2015 Rugby World Cup Pool A match between hosts nation England and Uruguay. England won 60–3 with 50,778 in attendance.

<text>Noel Gay (15 July 1898 – 4 March 1954) was born Reginald Moxon Armitage. He also used the name Stanley Hill professionally. He was a successful British composer of popular music of the 1930s and 1940s whose output comprised 45 songs as well as the music for 28 films and 26 London shows. Sheridan Morley has commented that he was &quot;the closest Britain ever came to a local Irving Berlin&quot;. He is best known for the musical, &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;.

==Early life==
Armitage was born in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth Grammar School before obtaining a scholarship at the age of 15 to attend the Royal College of Music in London, after which he attended university. A precocious talent, he had deputised for the choirmaster of Wakefield Cathedral from the age of eight, becoming honorary deputy organist at twelve. He had become music director and organist at St. Anne&#x27;s Church in London&#x27;s Soho district by the age of eighteen, prior a brief period of military service during the First World War and then studied at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

== Career ==
Whilst at Cambridge, Armitage&#x27;s interest in religious music and composition declined as that in musical comedy grew. He began writing popular songs, using the stage name Noel Gay. According to Morley the name was derived &quot;from a sign he read on a London bus in 1924: &#x27;NOEL Coward and Maisie GAY in a new revue&#x27;.&quot; His pseudonym of Stanley Hill was used from time to time for his more sentimental work. After contributing to revues such as &quot;Stop Press&quot; he was commissioned to write the entire score and lyrics for André Charlot&#x27;s 1926 revue. His next show was &quot;Clowns in Clover&quot;, which starred Cicely Courtneidge and Jack Hulbert, a husband-and-wife team of the time.

Gay&#x27;s career blossomed due to his talent for writing catchy, popular melodies in styles ranging from music hall to operetta.

His most famous show, for which he contributed the music but not the lyrics, was &quot;Me and My Girl&quot;. This originally opened in 1937 at the Victoria Palace Theatre, London and, after a shaky start, gained popularity when the BBC broadcast it live on radio on 13 January 1938. It starred Lupino Lane as Bill Snibson and it ran for 1,646 performances despite being bombed out of two theatres. The &quot;showstopper&quot; in that work was &quot;The Lambeth Walk&quot; which has the distinction of being the only popular song to be the subject of a leader in &quot;The Times&quot;. In October 1938 one of its leaders read &quot;While dictators rage and statesmen talk, all Europe dances – to &#x27;The Lambeth Walk&#x27;.&quot; The show was revived in 1952 and again in 1984, when the book was revised by Stephen Fry and came to include some of Gay&#x27;s own songs. The latter production ran for eight years, initially at the Haymarket Theatre in Leicester and then at the Adelphi Theatre in London, before going on tour throughout Britain and transferring to Broadway.

Gay went on to write songs for revues by The Crazy Gang, and for star artists like Gracie Fields, Flanagan and Allen and George Formby, as well as penning popular World War II songs such as &quot;Run, Rabbit, Run&quot; (with lyrics by Ralph Butler). He wrote two songs for the 1938 comedy film &quot;Save a Little Sunshine&quot;.

After the war, his musical output diminished and he concentrated more on production, in part because of increasing deafness and also because the fashion for cheerful Cockney-themed songs was on the wane.

He had created Noel Gay Music in 1938 as a business vehicle. It now forms a part of the Noel Gay Organisation which includes divisions for television and theatre and is a significant British showbusiness agency, under the day-to-day control of his family.

His son, Richard Armitage, set up the Noel Gay Artists agency and became an influential talent agent.

He died from cancer on 4 March 1954. 

==Shows==
Gay contributed to numerous shows, almost all of them musical comedies or revues. &quot;Grove Music Online&quot; lists the following, except where the genre is stated as uncertain or as pantomime:

==Songs==
Among Noel Gay&#x27;s songs were the following, sourced from US Library of Congress copyright catalogues and the catalogue of the National Library of Australia as indicated.

Some of his songs featured in the film &quot;Overlord&quot;

<text>Manjushri () is a &quot;bodhisattva&quot; who represents &quot;prajñā&quot; (transcendent wisdom) of the Buddhas in Mahāyāna Buddhism. The name &quot;Mañjuśrī&quot; is a combination of Sanskrit word &quot;&quot; and an honorific &quot;śrī&quot;; it can be literally translated as &quot;Beautiful One with Glory&quot; or &quot;Beautiful One with Auspiciousness&quot;. Mañjuśrī is also known by the fuller name of Mañjuśrīkumārabhūta (), literally &quot;Mañjuśrī, Still a Youth&quot; or, less literally, &quot;Prince Mañjuśrī&quot;. Another name of Mañjuśrī is Mañjughoṣa.

==In Mahāyāna Buddhism==

Scholars have identified Mañjuśrī as the oldest and most significant bodhisattva in Mahāyāna literature. Mañjuśrī is first referred to in early Mahāyāna sūtras such as the Prajñāpāramitā &quot;sūtra&quot;s and through this association, very early in the tradition he came to symbolize the embodiment of &quot;prajñā&quot; (transcendent wisdom). The &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; assigns him a pure land called &quot;Vimala&quot;, which according to the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; is located in the East. His pure land is predicted to be one of the two best pure lands in all of existence in all the past, present, and future. When he attains Buddhahood his name will be Universal Sight. In the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, Mañjuśrī also leads the Nagaraja&#x27;s daughter to enlightenment. He also figures in the &quot;Vimalakīrti Sūtra&quot; in a debate with Vimalakīrti where he is presented as a Bodhisattva who discusses non-duality with him.

An example of a wisdom teaching of Mañjuśrī can be found in the &quot;Saptaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot; (Taishō Tripiṭaka 232). This &quot;sūtra&quot; contains a dialogue between Mañjuśrī and the Buddha on the One Samādhi (Skt. &quot;Ekavyūha Samādhi&quot;). Sheng-yen renders the following teaching of Mañjuśrī, for entering &quot;samādhi&quot; naturally through transcendent wisdom:
==Vajrayāna Buddhism==

Within Vajrayāna Buddhism, Mañjuśrī is a meditational deity and considered a fully enlightened Buddha. In Shingon Buddhism, he is one of the Thirteen Buddhas to whom disciples devote themselves. He figures extensively in many esoteric texts such as the &quot;Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa&quot; and the &quot;Mañjuśrīnāmasamgīti&quot;. His consort in some traditions is Saraswati.

The &quot;Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa&quot;, which later came to be classified under Kriyātantra, states that &quot;mantra&quot;s taught in the Śaiva, Garuḍa, and Vaiṣṇava &quot;tantra&quot;s will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Mañjuśrī.

==Iconography==

Mañjuśrī is depicted as a male bodhisattva wielding a flaming sword in his right hand, representing the realization of transcendent wisdom which cuts down ignorance and duality. The scripture supported by the padma (lotus) held in his left hand is a &quot;Prajñāpāramitā sūtra&quot;, representing his attainment of ultimate realization from the blossoming of wisdom.

Mañjuśrī is often depicted as riding or seated on a blue lion, as can be seen at Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum in Singapore. (see opposite), or sitting on the skin of a lion. This represents the use of wisdom to tame the mind, which is compared to riding or subduing a ferocious lion.
In Chinese and Japanese Buddhist art, Mañjuśrī&#x27;s sword is sometimes replaced with a &quot;ruyi&quot; scepter, especially in representations of his &quot;Vimalakirti Sutra&quot; discussion with the layman Vimalakirti. According to Berthold Laufer, the first Chinese representation of a &quot;ruyi&quot; was in an 8th-century Mañjuśrī painting by Wu Daozi, showing it held in his right hand taking the place of the usual sword. In subsequent Chinese and Japanese paintings of Buddhas, a &quot;ruyi&quot; was occasionally represented as a Padma with a long stem curved like a &quot;ruyi&quot;.

He is one of the Four Great Bodhisattvas of Chinese Buddhism, the other three being Kṣitigarbha, Avalokiteśvara, and Samantabhadra. In China, he is often paired with Samantabhadra.

In Tibetan Buddhism, Mañjuśrī is sometimes depicted in a trinity with Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapāṇi.

==Mantras==

=== Arapacana mantra ===
A mantra commonly associated with Mañjuśrī is the following:

:&quot;oṃ arapacana dhīḥ&quot;

The Arapacana is a syllabary consisting of forty-two letters, and is named after the first five letters: &quot;a, ra, pa, ca, na&quot;. This syllabary was most widely used for the Gāndhārī language with the Kharoṣṭhī script but also appears in some Sanskrit texts. The syllabary features in Mahāyāna texts such as the longer &quot;Prajñāpāramitā&quot; texts, the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Lalitavistara Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Avataṃsaka Sūtra&quot;, the &quot;Dharmaguptaka Vinaya&quot;, and the &quot;Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya&quot;. In some of these texts, the Arapacana syllabary serves as a mnemonic for important Mahāyāna concepts. Due to its association with him, &quot;Arapacana&quot; may even serve as an alternate name for Mañjuśrī.

The &quot;Sutra on Perfect Wisdom&quot; (Conze 1975) defines the significance of each syllable thus:

# &quot;A&quot; is a door to the insight that all dharmas are unproduced from the very beginning (&quot;ādya-anutpannatvād&quot;).
# &quot;RA&quot; is a door to the insight that all dharmas are without dirt (&quot;rajas&quot;).
# &quot;PA&quot; is a door to the insight that all dharmas have been expounded in the ultimate sense (&quot;paramārtha&quot;).
# &quot;CA&quot; is a door to the insight that the decrease (&quot;cyavana&quot;) or rebirth of any dharma cannot be apprehended, because all dharmas do not decrease, nor are they reborn.
# &quot;NA&quot; is a door to the insight that the names (i.e. &quot;nāma&quot;) of all dharmas have vanished; the essential nature behind names cannot be gained or lost.

Tibetan pronunciation is slightly different and so the Tibetan characters read: &quot; (). In Tibetan tradition, this mantra is believed to enhance wisdom and improve one&#x27;s skills in debating, memory, writing, and other literary abilities. &quot; is the seed syllable of the mantra and is chanted with greater emphasis and also repeated a number of times as a decrescendo.

=== Other mantras ===

According to the &quot;Mañjuśrī­mūlakalpa&quot;, &quot;the ultimate heart essence of Mañjuśrī, which accomplishes all endeavors&quot; is the following mantra:Namaḥ sarvabuddhānām oṁ maṁ The &quot;Sādhanamālā&quot; also contains a popular mantra which refers to Mañjuśrī as the &quot;lord of speech&quot; (Vāgīśvara): Oṃ Vāgīśvara MūḥThis mantra is very popular in Nepal, where Vāgīśvara Mañjuśrī is a popular deity. 

Another Mañjuśrī mantra is the mantra for Mañjuvajra, a tantric form of Mañjuśrī associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, it is:Oṃ Mañjuvajra Hūṃ

==In Buddhist cultures==

===In China===
Mañjuśrī is known in China as &quot;Wenshu&quot; (). Mount Wutai in Shanxi, one of the four Sacred Mountains of China, is considered by Chinese Buddhists to be his bodhimaṇḍa. He was said to bestow spectacular visionary experiences to those on selected mountain peaks and caves there. In Mount Wutai&#x27;s Foguang Temple, the Manjusri Hall to the right of its main hall was recognized to have been built in 1137 during the Jin dynasty. The hall was thoroughly studied, mapped and first photographed by early twentieth-century Chinese architects Liang Sicheng and Lin Huiyin. These made it a popular place of pilgrimage, but patriarchs including Linji Yixuan and Yunmen Wenyan declared the mountain off limits.

Mount Wutai was also associated with the East Mountain Teaching. Mañjuśrī has been associated with Mount Wutai since ancient times. Paul Williams writes:

According to official histories from the Qing dynasty, Nurhaci, a military leader of the Jurchens of Northeast China and founder of what became the Qing dynasty, named his tribe after Mañjuśrī as the Manchus. The true origin of the name Manchu is disputed.

Monk Hanshan () is widely considered to be a metaphorical manifestation of Mañjuśrī. He is known for having co-written the following famous poem about reincarnation with monk Shide: 

In Tibetan Buddhism, Mañjuśrī manifests in a number of different Tantric forms. Yamāntaka (meaning &#x27;terminator of Yama i.e. Death&#x27;) is the wrathful manifestation of Mañjuśrī, popular within the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. Other variations upon his traditional form as Mañjuśrī include Namasangiti, Arapacana Manjushri, etc. In Tibetan Buddhism, Mañjuśrī is also an &quot;yidam&quot;. The Emperor Manjushri as a honorific title was also given to Qing emperors such as the Qianlong Emperor.

In the Taoist pantheon, Mañjuśrī is adopted as a Taoist deity known as Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun. This deity appears in the Ming Dynasty novel &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot; as a senior disciple of Yuanshi Tianzun, the highest deity in Taoism. However, the books &quot;Qunxian Xianpo Tianmen&quot; and &quot;Western Tang Dynasty Biography&quot; state that Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun and Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva are not the same person.
===In Nepal===
According to Swayambhu Purana, the Kathmandu Valley was once a lake. It is believed that Mañjuśrī came on a pilgrimage from his earthly abode-Wutaishan (five-peaked mountain) in China. He saw a lotus flower in the center of the lake, which emitted brilliant radiance. He cut a gorge at Chovar with his flaming sword to allow the lake to drain. The place where the lotus flower settled became the great Swayambhunath Stupa, and the valley thus became habitable.

===In Indonesia===
In eighth century Java during the Mataram Kingdom, Mañjuśrī was a prominent deity revered by the Sailendra dynasty, patrons of Mahayana Buddhism. The Kelurak inscription (782) and Manjusrigrha inscription (792) mentioned about the construction of a grand Prasada named &quot;Vajrāsana Mañjuśrīgṛha&quot; (Vajra House of Mañjuśrī) identified today as Sewu temple, located just 800 meters north of the Prambanan. Sewu is the second largest Buddhist temple in Central Java after Borobudur. The depiction of Mañjuśrī in Sailendra art is similar to those of the Pala Empire style of Nalanda, Bihar. Mañjuśrī was portrayed as a youthful handsome man with the palm of his hands tattooed with the image of a flower. His right hand is facing down with an open palm while his left-hand holds an &quot;utpala&quot; (blue lotus). He also uses the necklace made of tiger canine teeth.
