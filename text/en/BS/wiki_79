<text>is an exclave village that belongs to Higashimuro District, Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, but is located on the border between Mie and Nara Prefectures. It lies along the Kitayama River and has become a popular spot for log rafting.

As of 2016, the village has an estimated population of 432 and a density of 9 persons per km2. The total area is 48.21 km2.

Kitayama is the only remaining village in Wakayama Prefecture. Kitayama is known in Japan for growing a fruit called &quot;jabara&quot;, which is considered a potent cure for hay fever.

== History ==
Kitayama has a long history associated with logging, cutting trees and sending the timber to be sold in nearby Shingū. When the transition from the Edo period to the modern era of prefectures occurred, the people of Kitayama desired to remain a part of Wakayama prefecture due to their close connections with Shingu City, and as a result this request was granted and the village remains an exclave. In 2005, there were plans for the village to merge with Shingu but those plans were canceled.

<text>Alexander S. MacMillan (October 31, 1870 – August 7, 1955) was a Nova Scotia politician and businessman, the 13th premier of Nova Scotia, from 1940 to 1945.

MacMillan was born in Upper South River in Antigonish County. He made his fortune in lumbering and construction before being made chairman of the Nova Scotia Highways Board in 1920 and serving briefly as minister of highways in 1925. He was a member of Nova Scotia&#x27;s appointed upper house, the Legislative Council from 1925 until 1928 when he won a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly as a Liberal. He again became minister of highways in 1933. In 1940, when Premier Angus L. Macdonald went to Ottawa to serve in the wartime cabinet of William Lyon Mackenzie King, MacMillan became premier in his place. He retired as premier and from politics in 1945 to allow Macdonald to resume his provincial career. MacMillan died in Halifax at the age of 83.

<doc id="556115" wikidata="Q867112" url="?curid=556115" title="Gracias a Dios Department">
<text>Gracias a Dios (; &quot;Thanks to God&quot; or &quot;Thank God&quot;) is one of the 18 departments (&quot;departamentos&quot;) into which Honduras is divided. The departmental capital is Puerto Lempira; until 1975 it was Brus Laguna.

==Etymology==
The department is named in honor of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s landing in 1521. He is reported to have said &quot;gracias a Dios hemos salido de esas Honduras&quot; when he departed this part of Honduras for the Nicaraguan coast.

==History==
Once a part of the Mosquito Coast, it was formed in 1957 from all of Mosquitia territory and parts of Colón and Olancho departments, with the boundary running along 85° W from Cape Camarón south. The department is rather remote and inaccessible by land, although local airlines fly to the main cities.

== Geography ==
Gracias a Dios department covers a total surface area of 16,997 km2 and, in 2015, had an estimated population of 94,450. 

Although it is the second largest department in the country, it is sparsely populated, and contains extensive pine savannas, swamps, and rainforests. However, the expansion of the agricultural frontier is a perennial threat to the natural bounty of the department.

The department contains the Caratasca Lagoon, the largest lagoon in Honduras.

==Demographics==
At the time of the 2013 Honduras census, Gracias a Dios Department had a population of 90,795. Of these, 81.15% were Indigenous (79.70% Miskito, 0.95% Mayangna), 16.30% Mestizo, 1.58% Black or Afro-Honduran, 0.82% White and 0.15% others.

== Crime ==
Gracias a Dios is known to be a place of relatively high crime. Due to its remoteness and the Honduran government having a relatively low ability to fight crime, trafficking of narcotics is common in Gracias a Dios. Criminal organizations are also common in the area.

<doc id="556122" wikidata="Q751725" url="?curid=556122" title="Bay Islands Department">
<text>The Bay Islands (; ) is a group of islands off the Caribbean coast of Honduras. Collectively, the islands form one of the 18 departments of Honduras. The departmental capital is Coxen Hole, on the island of Roatán.

==Geography==
The Bay Islands consist of eight islands and 53 small cays lying to off the northern coast of Honduras. These islands have been administered as a department of the Republic of Honduras since 1872. Located on the Caribbean Sea, not far east of the entrance to the Gulf of Honduras, they are clearly visible from the mountainous mainland.

===Islands===
The total surface area of the islands is . In 2013, they had an estimated population of 71,500 people. The islands comprise three separate groups:
#Swan Islands are the northernmost island group of the three.
#Islas de la Bahía (with the main islands Roatán, Guanaja and Utila, and numerous satellite islands) are to the south.
#Cayos Cochinos are the southernmost island group of the three.

Roatán is the largest island, with a length of about and a maximum width of at its widest point. Roatán is characterized by its mountainous backbone, composed of hilltops that run west-to-east across the entire island. These hilltops are often crowned by outcrops of exposed metamorphic rocks such as marble, amphibolite, and serpentine. The island&#x27;s southern coast has an abundance of deep ports and wide inlets, or &#x27;bights&#x27;, protected by reefs, while its northern coast is, save for a few narrow passages, largely inaccessible, due to extensive coral reef growth.

The island of Saint Helena has been described as a virtual extension of Roatán, since it is separated only by a long stretch of mangrove swamp. This island has a small elevated hill at its center, and is characterized by a large number of caves, most of which are located along a cliff on its western end.

 Guanaja is the second largest island and is even more mountainous than Roatán. Geographically it features a series of hills, the highest of which rises to over 350 m above sea level, which is the highest elevation present in the Bay Islands. Alluvial plains characterize the areas between the hills.

Utila is third in size and is characterized by low mangrove swamps and a few small, low hills on its eastern end. The soils on this island are uncharacteristically fertile, perhaps owing to the islands&#x27;s flat topography as well as volcanic tuffs and basalt lavas through coralline limestone.

Barbareta, Morat, and the Hog Islands are all small and rugged. Barbareta can be distinguished by the fact that it contains numerous hills, the tallest one reaching a height of , above sea level. Approximately one-third of Barbareta is covered by serpentinite, making it the island with the largest deposit of serpentine among the Bay Islands. Morat, the smallest and flattest island, consists of just one ridge with two hills, which are composed mainly of sedimentary rocks, with some serpentinite intrusions.

The Bay Islands have no rivers and a small number of streams, which usually end at mangrove swamps (of which there are plenty on the Islands). There are, however, a large number of cool water springs in the Islands. Roatán features an intricate system of waterways on the south of the island, formed by the salt-water lagoons and drowned valleys on the island.

===Environment===
The archipelago has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of white-crowned pigeons, chimney swifts and yellow-naped amazons.

==History==

=== Pre-Columbian era ===
It is unknown exactly when human presence arrived on the islands, but archaeological studies find an organized presence on the islands long before European colonization. Archaeological sites such as Plan Grande in Guanaja show a level of sophistication and hierarchical organization of these towns throughout the archipelago. The islands served as a bridge between the intermediate area and the Mesoamerican world, since in addition to the presence of Intermediate peoples such as the Pech, evidence of Mayan presence and native Nahua speaking has been found.

=== European arrival and early history ===
The islands were anciently known as Las Guanajas, from Guanaja, first seen by Christopher Columbus in his fourth and last voyage to the New World, on July 30, 1502. The Admiral named it &#x27;Isle of Pines&#x27;, and claimed it for Spain. It was from this island that he then encountered the coast of the American continent, on which he landed on the 14th of August following, at the point now called Punta Castilla de Trujillo.

Pech Indians inhabited the islands, and they used boats to trade with Honduras, Yucatán, and (allegedly) Jamaica.

Notwithstanding Spanish laws prohibiting slavery, governors interested in the slave trade labeled the Pech Indians cannibals, hostile, and opposed to Christianity. Based on this information, Queen Isabella I of Spain issued a decree granting license to the Spaniards to capture and sell the islanders. Under this decree, Spanish slave traders from Cuba raided the Bay Islands continuously from the time of their discovery for the next 20 years. As a result, the population of the islands rapidly declined.

Diego Velasquez, governor of Cuba, in 1516 formally authorized several companies to trade in Indian slaves. In 1526, Hernán Cortés, who had conquered Mexico, marched to Trujillo to depose a rival conquistador from Cuba. The remaining Pech sought his protection, which Cortés provided. He drove away the slave traders, despite their licenses from the authorities in Cuba.
William Claiborne was the first non-Spanish European to attempt settling the Bay Islands, after being granted a patent in 1638 to begin a colony on the island of Roatán. The English would be involved in the Bay Islands for the next two hundred years.

Around this same period, Dutch, English, and French freebooters were leading raids on the Spanish in the Bay of Honduras. These raids largely avoided Claiborne&#x27;s settlement.

In 1642, English settlers from British Honduras (modern day Belize) invaded and occupied Port Royal on Roatán. These same settlers also raided the Spanish, provoking an attempt by the Spaniards to drive them out of the colony. This attempt was initially unsuccessful, but in March 1650, the Spanish finally succeeded in retaking Port Royal.

===English settlers in the Bay Islands===

The events which followed, so far as they concern these islands, are thus narrated by the Bishop Pelaez: &quot;On the 24th of September 1781, advices reached Truxillo, which were immediately communicated to the government at Comayagua, that certain Negroes and others, to the number of about 300 men, had constructed three forts at the entrance of the principal port of the island of Roatan, armed with 50 guns, and that three armed. Vessels cruised in the neighborhood, the object of the whole being to intercept the ships plying between the kingdom of Guatemala and Cuba. It was reported that these freebooters had 3000 barrels of provisions for their support, and that their object in holding the port was to make it a refuge for their vessels, which were no longer allowed to go-to Jamaica… When this information reached Guatemala, Viceroy Galvez, &quot;made arrangements to expel the intruders.&quot;


===Colony of the Bay Islands===
The English seem to have made no other demonstration on the islands during the 18th century. They remained in the undisturbed occupation of Spain. &quot;In 1821, when the Central American provinces achieved their independence, the islands were under the jurisdiction of the state of Honduras. This state of things continued until May, 1830, when the superintendent of the British establishment of Belize, as a measure of coercion against the republic, which had refused to surrender certain runaway slaves, made a descent on Roatan and seized it on behalf of the British crown. The federal authorities remonstrated, and the act was disavowed by the British government.&quot;

&quot;The superintendents of Belize, however, seem to have kept a longing eye on the islands, and to have watched for a pretext to place them under their own jurisdiction. In 1838 their wishes were in part gratified. A party of liberated slaves...of the Grand Cayman islands, came to Roatan to settle. Col. Loustrelet, the commandant, apprised them that they could not do so without the permission of the state government of Honduras.&quot;

&quot;A number applied for and obtained the requisite permission, and received grants of land. But another portion, incited by one or two white men among them, appealed, as British subjects, to the superintendent of Belize, Col. Macdonald, who immediately visited the island, in the British sloop-of war Bover, ran down the flag of Honduras, and, seizing Col. Loustrelet and his soldiers, landed them near Truxillo, and threatened them with death if they ventured to return.&quot;

The republic of Central America had meantime been dissolved, and the feeble state of Honduras was left alone to contest these violent proceedings. Her government remonstrated energetically, but without obtaining redress; and finally, in 1844, the British government instructed Mr. Chatfield, consul-general, to apprise the Honduras authorities, that &quot;when Col. Macdonald hauled down the flag of that state in Roatan, it was by order of the British government... no act of sovereignty followed on the proceedings of Macdonald. Meanwhile, the Cayman islanders continued to emigrate to Roatan, and, in 1848, the population numbered upward of 1,000.

In 1850, the British organized the islands Roatan, Guanaja, Barbareta, Helena, Morat, and Utila into a colony under their rule, called the Bay Islands.

A small party in the island favourable to British interests, was active in their efforts to secure English protection. &quot;When visited by Capt. Mitchell, E. N., in 1850, he describes them as &quot;electing their own magistrates, by universal suffrage,&quot; and &quot;quite ignorant under what government they are placed.&quot; A Mr. William Fitzgibbon was chief justice, and acting chief magistrate. Some time in this year, a petition was drawn up by the British party, addressed to the governor of Jamaica, asking him to name magistrates and assume supreme authority in the island.

Acting on this petition, Capt. Jolly in HMS &quot;Bermuda&quot; was sent to the islands. He called a meeting of the inhabitants, and declared them under the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. Chief Justice Fitzgibbon protested against the whole proceeding... In spite of this protest, however, and backed by the guns of &quot;Bermuda&quot;, the authorities appointed by Sir Charles Grey were duly installed in the islands. Two years after this occupation, on March 20, 1852, a royal warrant was issued, constituting the islands a colony, under the title of &quot;colony of the Bay islands,&quot; of which proclamation was made in Roatan, by Col. Wodehouse, superintendent of Belize, Aug. 10, 1852.

===Cession of the Colony to Honduras===

The proclamation of these islands as a British colony, attracted immediate attention in the United States, where it was universally regarded as a direct violation of the convention of July 5, 1850, known as the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty. This convention provides that &quot;the governments of the United States and Great Britain, neither the one nor the other, shall over occupy, or fortify, or colonize, or assume or exercise any dominion over Costa Rica, Nicaragua, the Mosquito shore, or any part of Central America.&quot;

The matter was brought under the attention of Congress, and the committee of foreign relations of the U.S. senate, after a full consideration, reported &quot;that the islands of Roatán, Bonacca, Utila, etc, in and near the bay of Honduras, constitute part of the territory of the republic of Honduras, and therefore form a part of Central America; and, in consequence, that any occupation of these islands by Great Britain is a violation of the treaty of July 5, 1850.&quot;

Expostulations to this effect were at once addressed by the American government to that of the United Kingdom, and an elaborate correspondence was carried on through the years 1854–1856, between Mr. Buchanan, American minister in London, and Lord Clarendon, on the subject, but without any satisfactory result. The United Kingdom hastily augmented her naval forces on the West India station, and her example was promptly followed by the United States; and, for a time, the peace of the two countries hung upon the discretion of a few naval commanders, acting under orders necessarily vague and indefinite.

At this critical moment the government of Honduras despatched a minister to London, who took the ground that the question at issue was one that primarily concerned Honduras, and he demanded the surrender of the islands, equally as a measure of justice to that republic, and as a means of withdrawing a dangerous issue between the United States and the United Kingdom, upon which each had committed itself beyond the power of receding.

This solution was regarded with favor by both parties, and a convention was entered into between the United Kingdom and Honduras, whereby the Bay islands were placed under the sovereignty of the latter state, with the reservation of trial by jury, freedom of conscience, etc., to the actual inhabitants.

The principles of this convention were accepted by Honduras, but some of its details were viewed with disfavor by the Honduras congress, and it was returned to London for certain modifications. These changes were made, and the &quot;colony of the Bay islands&quot; ceased to exist, and the islands passed under the sovereignty of Honduras.

Many of the English settlers disagreed with this resolution. They sought the help of American filibuster William Walker in order to put pressure on the British government to keep the islands. Walker who in 1857 had been deposed from the presidency of Nicaragua, by a Central American army, decided to assist them. Walker arrived in Honduras, and landed in Trujillo with one hundred men, but his efforts to help the English settlers were in vain. Walker was captured by Captain Nowell Salmo, turned over to Honduran authorities, and executed on September 12, 1860.

===Citizenship===
== Population ==
The population of the Bay Islands in 2010 was 49,158, according to the INE Population and Housing Census. It is the department with the smallest population in Honduras. 25,182 are women and 23,976 are men. The population density of the department is 208 inhabitants per km2, with the highest concentrations in Roatán and Utila.

Roatán is the municipality with the most inhabitants, 29,636 in total. This municipality is followed by José Santos Guardiola, Guanaja, and Utila. The crude birth rate in the Bay Islands is 34.3. The mortality rate is 4.3, while the fertility rate is 3.7. The infant mortality rate is 24.7, while life expectancy in the islands is 72.6 years (2001 census). In 2001, the migratory balance was 13,109 immigrants vs. 3,789 emigrants, leaving a net migratory balance of 9,320.34 residents.

=== Ethnic composition ===
During the pre-Hispanic period, the Bay Islands were inhabited by the Pech people and other indigenous peoples. Archaeological remains found in the area, such as those on the island of Guanaja, show that these indigenous peoples originally inhabited all the island. However, they were eventually forced to relocate, or they were captured, enslaved, or killed after the foreign occupation of the Bay Islands. Due to this, the islands were practically uninhabited by the year 1528.

The archipelago began to be populated again by European people due to the arrival of English, French, and Dutch buccaneers who established their camps on the islands. From then on, the Bay Islands were the scene of frequent conflict between Spaniards and non-Spanish pirates.

=== White population ===

On the three main islands there live descendants of British settlers (mainly English) who occupied the islands in the 18th century. By the mid-19th century, under the Wyke-Cruz treaty, many of the descendants of the white colonists of Great Britain changed their citizenship to Honduran after the country regained the territory, and they officially separated from the British Empire. However, it would take several decades for them to assimilate into the Honduran population.

A 2013 census determined that 11.41% of the population of the Bay Islands is white. However, it has been confirmed that more than 40% of the population on the island of Roatán is of foreign origin. These are mostly white Americans and French Canadians, as well as some European immigrants who have decided to buy properties on the islands.

=== Black population ===

During the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century, under British occupation, several contingents of black people arrived on these islands, among which three major groups stand out:

(1) The Afro-colonial or French blacks, brought by the Spanish colonizers.

(2) The Black Caribs or Garífunas.

(3) The Anglo-Antilleans, known as English-speaking blacks, brought from Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to work in agriculture.

At present, the black inhabitants of the Bay Islands are not a genetically homogeneous group. Some black caribs with European ancestry and lighter skin refer to themselves as &quot;browns&quot; while referring to those with less European ancestry and darker skin as &quot;colored&quot;.

==Economy==

The economy of the Bay Islands depends directly on two sectors – tourism and fisheries, representing approximately 50% of gross island product and both closely linked to the archipelago’s environment. All other activities provide services to these sectors, either directly as in the case of transportation or indirectly such as real estate and construction. The dynamic character of these sectors has led to accelerated growth over the last two decades, a phenomenon that has induced population growth rates approaching 8% annually, largely as a result of migration from various parts of Honduras and elsewhere.

The Bay Islands serve &quot;as the major anchor site for Honduras&#x27;s growing tourism industry, accounting for approximately 28% of all tourism arrivals.&quot; In 1990, an estimated 15,000 tourists came to the islands; by 1996 it was 60,000. According to the Honduran Institute of Tourism, during the year 2010 the islands of Roatán received 803,102 cruise shippers, 373,273 more than those received in 2009 (an increase of 86.8%). Total tourism receipts are estimated in the neighborhood of US$55 million annually.

Islander men frequently join on with the merchant marine or work on international cruise ships for several months of the year. This low-key existence began to change starting in the late 1960s, when tourists discovered the islands’ reefs, beaches, and funky culture. Since the late 1980s, the pace has picked up dramatically.

<text>The Minnesota Golden Gophers (commonly shortened to Gophers) are the college sports teams of the University of Minnesota. The university fields a total of 21 (9 men&#x27;s, 12 women&#x27;s) teams in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports and competes in the Big Ten Conference.

The Gophers women&#x27;s ice hockey team is a six-time NCAA champion and seven-time national champion. In women&#x27;s ice hockey, the Gophers belong to the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. In all other sports, they belong to the Big Ten Conference. Most of the facilities that the teams use for training and competitive play are located on the East Bank of the Minneapolis campus. There are arenas for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball (Williams Arena) as well as ice hockey (Mariucci Arena and Ridder Arena). The Gopher football team began playing at Huntington Bank Stadium in September 2009. The women&#x27;s soccer team plays on the St. Paul campus in the Elizabeth Lyle Robbie Stadium.

The Cheerleaders and the Dance Team are also part of the university&#x27;s athletic department; they are present at events for basketball, ice hockey, and football, and compete for UCA/UDA national titles in the winter. The University of Minnesota spirit squad was the first as sideline cheerleading was invented at the U of M, and it prides itself in being one of the largest spirit squads in the country. The U of M spirit squad currently consists of three cheerleading teams (all girl, coed, and small coed), a dance team, Goldy Gopher, and a unique ice hockey cheerleading team. The dance team won its 19th national title in 2019.

During the 2006–07 academic year, the Golden Gophers wrestling team won the NCAA national championship and the Big Ten team title. The Golden Gophers also won conference championships in men&#x27;s ice hockey, men&#x27;s golf, women&#x27;s rowing, men&#x27;s swimming and diving, and women&#x27;s indoor track and field.

== Notable non varsity sports ==

=== Rugby ===
Minnesota rugby plays Division I college rugby in the Big Ten Universities conference against traditional Big Ten rivals such as Wisconsin and Iowa. Minnesota qualified for the national playoffs in 2008, and finished the 2008 season ranked 7th in the nation. Some of Minnesota&#x27;s games have been well attended by fans, with the team drawing as many as 6,000 fans to watch the team play at TCF Bank Stadium.

== Traditions ==

=== The &quot;Golden&quot; Gophers ===
The University Mascot is derived from a nickname for the state of Minnesota, &quot;The Gopher State.&quot; The original design was based on the thirteen-lined ground squirrel. The state nickname derives from a political cartoon by R. O. Sweeny, published as a broadside in 1858. The cartoon depicted state legislators as gophers dragging the state in the wrong direction. The nickname was associated with the university as early as the publication of the first yearbook in 1888, which was titled &quot;The Gopher&quot;. Other early yearbooks included depictions of gophers as well, and the University of Minnesota football coach Clarence Spears officially named the football team the Gophers in 1926. After the radio announcer Halsey Hall began referring to the team as the Golden Gophers due to the color of their uniforms, the team was renamed under coach Bernie Bierman.

===School songs===
School songs for the university include Minnesota Rouser, Minnesota March, Go Gopher Victory, Our Minnesota, Minnesota Fight, Hail! Minnesota, and the Battle Hymn of the Republic.

<doc id="556138" wikidata="Q867089" url="?curid=556138" title="Olancho Department">
<text>Olancho is the largest of all the 18 departments into which Honduras is divided. The department covers a total surface area of 24,057 km² and has an estimated 2015 population of 537,306 inhabitants.

The departmental capital is Juticalpa, which is also the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Juticalpa, which covers the department.

==Terrain==

Rugged mountains rise in the western and northern portions of the department, notably the Sierra de Agalta, the Montaña de Tembladeros, and the Montaña de Botaderos. Vast pine and hardwood forests cover these mountains.

Central Olancho has rolling plains, watered by the Guayape River and its affluents. These plains, sometimes called pampas due to their similarity to the vast Argentinian plains, are famous for their large cattle herds and extensive farming. The main cities, capital Juticalpa and Catacamas, are located there.

The eastern part of the department is covered with rainforests, though the influx of impoverished, farmers and intense timber extraction have increased deforestation rates in the area. A portion of the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve, a tropical rainforest with diverse wildlife and declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO, straddles the border of Olancho and the neighboring departments of Gracias a Dios and Colón.

The Guayape River is famous for its placer gold with concessions where today the mining company Eurocantera (Goldlake Group) exploits ethical gold. First exploited by the Spaniards during the colonial period, these gold deposits are still productive. Local men and women may be seen panning for gold in riverbanks during the dry season. Extensive gold dredging is also underway during the dry season in much of the river, including deep into the mountainous regions of the Rio Patuca (into which the Guayape feeds).

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Cave of Talgua, also known as &quot;The Cave of the Glowing Skulls,&quot; is located near Catacamas. It was used as a burial site by the native peoples, and over time, the bones left there were covered by the calcite dripping from the ceiling, giving them an eerie, sparkling appearance. Radiocarbon testing indicated that the burials were made around 900 B.C., well before the rise of the Mayans and other civilizations. The ossuary chamber was discovered in 1994 by a Peace Corps volunteer named Timothy Berg, along with two Catacamas locals named Desiderio Reyes and Jorge Yáñez, and research is still being conducted in the area. In the 18th and 19th century, Olancho resisted government authority from Tegucigalpa, resulting in armed conflicts.

=== Colonization ===
During colonization of what is now Olancho, as many as 2,000 African slaves had been imported to Honduras to work in the gold washings of Olancho. Mainly coming from what is now known as Angola and Senegambia, while many others came from the Caribbean. In 1542, about 165 slaves came via Portugal and about 150 from Santo Domingo, mostly coming from Mandinka kangurao of the Gambia River in Senegambia. By the 1800s, escaped and enslaved Africans made up more than 60% of the Honduran population, according to Barahona.

=== Modern day ===

Old independent sentiments persist among &quot;Olanchanos&quot;, although the department&#x27;s role as an agricultural producer has made it an integral part of the Honduran economy. The former president of Honduras, Porfirio Lobo, hails from the department, specifically from the city of Juticalpa. Also former president, now congressman, Manuel Zelaya Rosales is from the city of Catacamas, also from the department.

The Olancho Department remained as one of the most violent areas in Honduras until 2012. In June 2012, after a Drug Enforcement Administration agent killed a suspect in Honduras, it was confirmed that the US government has been running covert operations in the Olancho area to combat drug trafficking. Many multinational corporations as well as charitable and religious organizations with personnel in Honduras actively discourage their members from visiting Olancho or suggest caution, as do the governments of the US, Canada, France, New Zealand and the UK, among others.

== Popular culture ==

Olancho was the subject of a 2017 feature-length documentary film of the same name. The documentary, which was directed and produced by American filmmakers Chris Valdes and Ted Griswold, focused on the lives of band members from &quot;Los Plebes de Olancho&quot;, a regional narco-corrido music band. The logline of the film is as follows:Manuel, a farmer from Olancho, Honduras, seeks fame by making music for the region’s drug cartels. When some of his song lyrics get him in trouble, Manuel must make the most difficult decision of his life: continue the quest for fame, or flee.&quot;Olancho&quot; premiered at the 2017 Big Sky Documentary Film Festival in Missoula, Montana. Over the course of the following two years, the film went on to screen at dozens of international film festivals, including at the Rotterdam Film Festival in the Netherlands and the Berlin Film Festival in Germany. The film earned the Special Jury Prize for Best Documentary Feature at the 2017 New Orleans Film Festival, Best Cinematography at the 2017 Tulsa American Film Festival, and Best Feature Documentary Film at the 2017 Nevada City Film Festival. &quot;Olancho&quot; is distributed by First Run Features and is now available streaming on Kanopy and for purchase on Amazon.

<doc id="556147" wikidata="Q652071" url="?curid=556147" title="Grimlock">
<text>Grimlock is the name of several fictional robot characters in the Transformers robot franchise. He is usually portrayed as the leader of the Dinobots, which are a subfaction of Autobots who can transform into metal dinosaurs. Grimlock is known for his dialogue being spoken in the third person. He appeared on screen along with other Dinobots in the of the Transformers film series.

==Transformers: Generation 1==
In the Generation 1 continuity, Grimlock is the leader of the Dinobots. Grimlock’s character is merciless and contemptuous of those he considers beneath him, such as human beings and, at times his fellow Autobots
. The character&#x27;s initial sense of superiority was changed by the relationships he formed with others as he got to know them on a personal level and started to see them as equals.

Grimlock is among some of the strongest of the Generation 1 transformers, possibly equal to or even superior to Optimus Prime and Megatron in most continuities. When in his &quot;tyrannosaurus rex&quot; mode, his jaws can snap virtually anything that comes between them. He is able to breathe fire and shoot a heat ray from his mouth. He has no significant weaknesses, except for a relatively slow top speed and arrogance. 

===Reception===
Grimlock was ranked by IGN as one of their favorite Autobots.

According to X-Entertainment, Grimlock was the 2nd best Transformers figure of all time.

One of the original Grimlock toys was on display in the Natural History Museum, London. It has since been removed.

===Animated series===

====The Transformers====
The original character profiles written by Bob Budiansky and Dan Bobro indicate that Grimlock and the Dinobots were intended to come from Cybertron to Earth like most of the other Transformers. However, the cartoon would disregard this entirely.

After the animated series ended in the US Grimlock appeared in animated form one last time in the commercial for the Classic Pretenders.

===Books===
Grimlock was featured in the 1985 Find Your Fate Junior book called &quot;Dinobots Strike Back&quot; by Casey Todd.

Grimlock appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book &quot;The Lost Treasure of Cybertron&quot; by Marvel Books.

Grimlock was featured in the 1993 &quot;Transformers: Generation 2&quot; coloring book &quot;Decepticon Madness&quot; by Bud Simpson.

===Comics===
====3H Enterprises====
Both Grimlock and his counterpart appeared in the storyline.

The Autobots returning to Cybertron, along with Blackarachnia and Silverbolt were then abducted via teleportation beams and taken to Unicron. Tap-Out, Megatron, Brawn, War Within Grimlock and Snarl were also abducted from various timelines (Transformers: Universe #1). &quot;Within&quot; Grimlock, &quot;Armada&quot; Megatron and &quot;Universe&quot; Optimus Primal are each transported to the Unicron world, where they eventually team up and fight Striker and Reptilion. Note: There is a small continuity error in that this story ends with Grimlock, Megatron and Primal standing over Reptilion, but issue #2 of the comic starts with them standing over Striker (2003 Botcon Voice Actor Play).

After the events of the Botcon 2003 voice actor play, Optimus Primal is able to use his spark telepathy to free Striker from Unicron&#x27;s influence. Optimus Primal, Megatron, and Grimlock help break free the slaves from various timelines that are held there and gets them to Cybertron (Transformers: Universe #2).

====Condor Verlag====
In a story called &quot;By their Blasters, you shall know them...!&quot; from &quot;Transformers Comic-Magazine&quot; issue #12 by German comic publisher Condor Verlag, Optimus Prime instructs Backstreet, Bumblebee and Ruckus on how to identify Autobots from Decepticons in battle using the Ark&#x27;s computer. Pretender Grimlock is one of those he displays to the Autobots. He is identified as a Decepticon.

====Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing====
Grimlock also appeared in several of the G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers series from Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing. 

Grimlock returned in the third series as a main character. Grimlock, Arcee, Bumblebee, and Perceptor were sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of cybertronian technology on the planet. There is a notable disparity in Grimlock&#x27;s speech patterns between the second and third series. In the second series, he is seen to speak normally, referring to himself as &quot;I.&quot;. However, in the third series he speaks in his more normal &quot;Me Grimlock&quot; speech.

====Dreamwave Productions====
The 21st century re-imagining of the original universe by Dreamwave Productions depicted Grimlock in a manner similar to his depiction in Marvel Comics: a powerful, cunning warrior who values strength of body and character. Through &quot;&quot;, the company shaped a background on Cybertron for Grimlock, which showed that he had participated in the planet&#x27;s underground gladiatorial game in order to unleash the rage and anger he had always overflowed with. 

Dreamwave&#x27;s closure meant that they would tell no further stories of their Grimlock, although his &quot;War Within&quot;-era design did appear in the &quot;Transformers: Universe&quot; comic book exclusive to BotCon. Grimlock also appeared in the Dreamwave &quot;Transformers/G.I. Joe&quot; comic. Although not one of the Dinobots in this continuity, transforming into a Sherman Tank, this Grimlock shared the rebellious attitude and speech mannerisms of other incarnations of the G1 character, although he had a softer attitude towards humans.

====Fun Publications====
=====Classicverse=====
Based on the &quot;Transformers Classic&quot; toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and &quot;Generation 2&quot; comics).

=====Wings Universe=====

====IDW Publishing====
In a flashback in &quot;Maximum Dinobots&quot; #1 Grimlock leads the Dinobots in taking a Decepticon energon silo in Sub-Sector Nine on Cybertron.

In the Transformers Spotlight issue on Shockwave, Grimlock and the &#x27;Dinobots&#x27; (sporting Cybertronian designs much like their War Within designs) appear in a story that partially pays homage to their Marvel G1 origin. Following this, Skywatch, a government agency that knew about Transformers, took over the site. Later, following escalating Transformer activity on Earth (as seen in &quot;The Transformers: Devastation&quot;) and losing control of their other captive Transformers Ravage and Laserbeak, Skywatch reactivated Grimlock as a response. Following their acquisition of the Transformers licence in 2005, IDW Publishing released a comic book series that takes place during the &quot;Beast Wars&quot; animated series but features the toys and characters who did not appear in the show itself. The &quot;Beast Wars&quot; incarnation of Grimlock appeared as a gigantic white &quot;Velociraptor&quot;-type dinosaur, and it was revealed that Grimlock was among those in protoform stasis on the Axalon and, like the others was launched into space in the series pilot.

He appears among the Maximals on the cover of the first issue of the sequel story, &quot;Beast Wars: The Ascending&quot;. In the beginning of &quot;Beast Wars, The Ascending&quot; Razorbeast speaks to Prowl and Wolfang about how he feels there is no rescue mission coming for them from Cybertron as Grimlock hunts in the nearby woods. In &quot;Beast Wars: The Ascending&quot; #4, Grimlock was among the Maximals and Predacons returned to Cybertron to battle Shokaract.

Grimlock had a biography printed in the &quot;Beast Wars Sourcebook&quot; by IDW Publishing.

=====Dawn of the Predacus=====
Grimlock also features briefly in the comic story &quot;Dawn of the Predacus,&quot; in which his exposure to transmatter turns him into a protoform, heralding his eventual role in &quot;Beast Wars&quot; fiction. As he is placed in a stasis pod, he is looked upon by Predacon-and future Maximal-Dinobot, possibly indicating where the warrior took his future name.

====Manga====
In the Japanese manga &quot;Big War&quot; #2, the Autobots Rodimus Prime, Grimlock, Kup, and Wheelie, along with their human allies Spike Witwicky and Daniel Witwicky send Computron into battle against Galvatron&#x27;s new warrior combiner Abominus. The Terrorcons spit &quot;corrosive control liquid&quot; against Computron, taking control of him and turning him into a Decepticon. Spike luckily uses his new Exosuit to free Computron with &quot;defense spray&quot;. Defeated, Galvatron retreats.

====Marvel Comics====
Since Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Transformers&quot; series were primarily written by Bob Budiansky in its early years, the writer was able to present his origin for the Dinobots as he had originally conceived it. Grimlock appeared in his blue Generation 2 form in the short-lived UK. Generation 2 comic series.

====TFcon comics====
Grimlock appears in the TFcon 2008 voice-play prelude comic called &quot;Ground Effects,&quot; where Perceptor informs him about a repeat repeat wave.

Grimlock is one of the characters who appeared in &quot;&quot;, and unlike past versions of the character, he is shown to be charismatic and civilized, but only when in his Dino mode does he show impediments in speech (akin to Bruce Banner / The Incredible Hulk). Grimlock, now alone on prehistoric Earth, scanned a Tyrannosaurus alt. mode and became known as the King of the Dinosaurs.

== Transformers: EarthSpark ==

Grimlock is one of the physically strongest and most imposing Autobots, whether in his robot mode or his fire-breathing tyrannosaurus rex beast mode. As scary as he may seem, he&#x27;s a good guy through and through, and happy to nurture and encourage the new generation of Cybertronians. He values strength, not just physical, but filling his charges with confidence and the spirit to find themselves. This guidance has brought him close to the Terran gentle Jawbreaker, who scanned a dinosaur alternate mode in emulation of him.

Grimlock&#x27;s most powerful and dangerous trait, however, is his anger. Able to channel his fury into a &quot;rage mode&quot; that makes him an unstoppable engine of destruction, he becomes a potential threat to even his closest allies when his optics go from blue to red. While he&#x27;s usually able to control his anger, prolonged time in his dinosaur mode can disrupt his system, and the traumas he&#x27;s suffered carry triggers, meaning those around him have to be careful not to set him off.

==History==
The area of Takatori was part of ancient Yamato Province. Located on the road connecting Asuka with Yoshino and Kii Province, many kofun burial mounds are located within the town. Per the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; and other ancient texts, this area was settled by many &quot;toraijin&quot; immigrant clans, including the Yamatonoaya clan and the Hata clan. The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; also contains a passage that prohibits felling of trees around Takatoriyama in 676 (the oldest forest conservation system in Japan) [1]. This suggests that the area had developed as a region that supported the surrounding population since ancient times. Per the &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot; the Hata clan grew medicinal herbs brought to Japan from Silla in this area. During the Muromachi period, the area was ruled by the Ochi clan, and in the Sengoku period, the massive Takatori Castle was constructed. The town was the &quot;jōkamachi&quot; of Takatori Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate in the Edo period. 

The village of Takatori was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was elevated to town status on June 3, 1891. On October 1, 1954 Takatori annexed the neighboring villages of Funakura and Ochioka.

==Government==
Takatori has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral town council of eight members. Takatori, collectively with the cities of Kashihara and Takaichi, contributes four members to the Nara Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Nara 3rd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==

<doc id="556165" wikidata="Q752397" url="?curid=556165" title="Asuka, Nara">
<text>is a village located in Takaichi District, Nara Prefecture, Japan. As of April 1, 2017, the village has an estimated population of 5,681, with 2,170 households, and a population density of . The total area is .

Asuka is the land where ancient palaces were located. There are strict rules governing construction in this historic town.

Asuka can be reached from Okadera or Asuka Station on Kintetsu Yoshino Line train line. Although it&#x27;s outside Asuka, Kashiharajingū-mae Station in neighboring Kashihara has service on the Kintetsu Kashihara Line, Minami Osaka Line and Yoshino Lines. By car, Asuka is on Route 169.

== History ==
&quot;For the ancient Asuka, see Asuka period and Asuka, Yamato.&quot;

In 1956, the village of Asuka (明日香) was founded as a result of a merger of three villages, Sakaai, Takechi and Asuka (飛鳥村).

In 1966, Asuka was proclaimed a &quot;historic town&quot;, as defined by the national Special Arrangement for Preservation of Historic Sites Law as well as Kyoto, Nara and Kamakura. The law restricts constructions and other civil engineering operations in the designated areas due preservation of the historic sites. In 1967, a part of Asuka, around 391ha in area, was designated as a historic site for preservation. Along with this decision, the government planned to build Asuka National Historic Park, for which construction was launched in 1966 and finished in 1994.

In 1972, a site with colorfully painted murals from the late Asuka period was found in the Takamatsuzuka Tomb.

Since the Special Arrangement for Preservation of Historic Sites Law (1966) restricts any visual changes in the areas which it concerns, it has directly affected the daily life of residents. To preserve the site, they have had to give up some elements of modern life. As compensation, the Asuka Law, which aims to preserve the site effectively and give economic support for Asuka residents, was settled in 1980.

== Asuka megaliths and kofun ==
The Asuka region contains a number unusual carved granite stones, the largest of which has been named Masuda no iwafune. This granite monolith is approximately in length, in width, and in height. The upper surface is flat, with a shallow trough and two square holes. The megalith is located on top of a hill a few hundred meters west of Okadera Station. When, how or why this and other colossal stones in Asuka were carved remains a mystery. They appear to be in a different style than later Buddhist sculptures.

Nearby there are also several &quot;kofun&quot;s (tombs), including the Ishibutai Kofun—built from massive boulders including one that weighs an estimated 75 tons. This may have been the tomb of Soga no Umako.

<text>is a town located in Yoshino District, Nara Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 5,874 in 2997 households, and a population density of 61 persons per km2. The total area of the town is . In 2012, Yoshino was designated one of The Most Beautiful Villages in Japan.

==Geography==

Yoshino is located in the central part of Nara Prefecture. The Ryumon Mountains run east-to-west in the north, and the Omine Mountain Range (Mount Aonega is the highest point within the town area) spread out to the south. The mountains that extend from the Daidaka Mountains also are to the east. Between these, the Yoshino River flows from southeast-to-west through the center of the town, and the Takami River flows from east-to-west.

The Yoshino River meanders left and right from the upstream (Kawakami Village) to the area where the Tsuburo River flows into it, weaving its way through the mountains. Along the way, the Takami River joins it near Shinko and Kubogainai. After crossing Imoyama and Seyama, near Yoshino High School, it makes a large left turn and continues downstream (Oyodo Town) in a relatively straight line. Inside the meandering Yoshino River, there is a long and narrow stretch of relatively flat land, forming settlements. There is also relatively open land near the middle reaches of the tributaries of the Yoshino River, where settlements have formed. The Kamiichi district, where the town hall is located, is densely packed with houses in the small space between the river and the mountains.

An account of Yoshino written in about 1714 explained that, on their climb to the top, travelers would be able to enjoy the lower 1,000 cherry trees at the base, the middle 1,000 on the way, the upper 1,000 toward the top, and the 1,000 in the precincts of the inner shrine at the top.

===Festivals===

&quot;Hatsuichi&quot;, which means &quot;first market&quot;, is an annual festival in early February. Before supermarkets and other modern conveniences existed, the townspeople gathered every ten days for a market. &quot;Hatsuichi&quot; marked the first market of the new lunar year. Over time &quot;Hatsuichi&quot; and the local Ebisu Shrine joined in creating the modern festival. Ebisu is a god of business and one of the seven &quot;lucky gods&quot; derived from China. The Ebisu Shrine is decorated with lanterns, traditional ornaments and colors for the festival, which now marks the annual opening of the shrine. On the afternoon of &quot;Hatsuichi&quot; a portable shrine is paraded through the town.

In July, the neighboring town of Oyodo hosts the Yoshino-gawa festival, which includes a fireworks display.

In early October, the town holds a sports festival in honor of Japan&#x27;s national Health and Sports Day. An opening ceremony including fireworks and the lighting of an Olympic-style torch takes place as neighborhoods compete in various games. Prizes are awarded on the neighborhood and town level, and may include items such as bags of rice, bicycles, toaster ovens, heaters, tissues, beer, game systems, and various household items. The town&#x27;s schools also participate in the event with various dances and performances.

The Aki Matsuri (Fall or Autumn Festival) is held in mid- to late October. Activities include a parade of lanterns and drums down the main street to one of the town&#x27;s temples near the top of a mountain. The town&#x27;s &quot;bunkasai&quot; (cultural festival) also takes place around this time, with numerous performances by townspeople and local school children, as well as displays of calligraphy, pottery, paintings, and flower arrangements by local artists in the town&#x27;s cultural hall.

<doc id="556182" wikidata="Q7950968" url="?curid=556182" title="WITN-TV">
<text>WITN-TV (channel 7) is a television station licensed to Washington, North Carolina, United States, serving Eastern North Carolina as an affiliate of NBC and MyNetworkTV. Owned by Gray Media, the station has primary studio facilities on East Arlington Boulevard in Greenville, with an additional studio in New Bern. Its transmitter is located in Grifton Township along NC 118.

==History==
The station signed on September 28, 1955, from facilities on US 17 in Chocowinity (outside Washington, though with a Washington mailing address). It was the area&#x27;s second television outlet to launch after Greenville&#x27;s WNCT-TV (channel 9). It was an NBC affiliate from the start but shared secondary ABC relations with WNCT until the 1963 sign-on of WNBE-TV (channel 12, now WCTI-TV) in New Bern. WITN&#x27;s first broadcast was game 1 of the 1955 World Series.

WITN aired an analog signal on VHF channel 7 from the region&#x27;s highest transmitter at that time. The station was originally owned by North Carolina Television, a consortium of radio stations from Northeastern North Carolina. Majority ownership was held by the Roberson family, owners of WITN radio (930 AM, now WDLX; and FM 93.3, now WERO).

The group held onto the television station until 1985, when it was sold to AFLAC. It added the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix to its call sign on July 31, 1978. In 1997, AFLAC sold its broadcasting group to Retirement Systems of Alabama which merged with Ellis Communications to form Raycom Media. However, Raycom could not keep WITN for long due to a significant signal overlap with Wilmington&#x27;s WECT, an Ellis property that was part of the deal. WITN&#x27;s city-grade signal reaches the northern portion of the Wilmington market. At the time, the FCC normally did not allow one company to own two stations with overlapping signals, and would not even consider a waiver for a city-grade overlap. What was then known as Gray Communications (now Gray Television) bought the station later in 1997. It has been broadcasting a full-power digital signal since June 2006. They eventually reunited in 2019 after Gray acquired Raycom, but by then, overlaps of signals were not considered as long as the stations were in separate markets.

On January 7, 2009, a high definition feed of WITN-TV was launched on DirecTV and can now also be obtained on Dish Network. WITN-TV ended regular programming over its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 32, using virtual channel 7. As part of the SAFER Act, WITN-TV kept its analog signal on the air until June 26 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters. In June 2013, the station moved from its longtime home outside Washington to new high definition-ready studios in Greenville.

In addition to offering network and syndicated programming, WITN was also a multimedia rights partner for East Carolina University Athletics from 1998 to 2014. In addition to hosting the weekly coaches&#x27; shows for football and basketball, the station produced live broadcasts of select games that were not picked up nationally by ESPN as part of its deal with Conference USA. Even though most of the broadcasts were limited to its own market, WITN got other television outlets throughout North Carolina to carry a football game in 2003 which saw ECU competing against in-state rival University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium. In 2014, WNCT-TV picked up the ECU sports package, just as the school moved its programs to the American Athletic Conference.

==WITN-DT2==
WITN-DT2 is the MyNetworkTV-affiliated second digital subchannel of WITN-TV, broadcasting in standard definition on channel 7.2.

===History===
Originally, WITN-DT2 served as a 24-hour local weather channel. It picked up MyNetworkTV on September 28, 2009, after the area&#x27;s Ion Television owned-and-operated station WEPX-TV, channel 38 (and its full-time satellite, WPXU-TV, channel 35) dropped the programming service. At that point, local weather programming was reduced to overnights and mornings while syndicated offerings made up the rest of WITN-DT2&#x27;s schedule. A further addition to that service occurred April 18, 2011, when it added MeTV and dropped all remaining weather-related programming with the new network taking up most of the weekend and daytime schedule.

Eventually, a new third digital subchannel signed on and began offering a 24-hour live feed of WITN&#x27;s own Doppler weather radar. On January 17, 2013, it separated programming from MyNetworkTV and MeTV onto dedicated digital subchannels (with MeTV relocating to the third subchannel).

For a period of time, WITN-DT2 could also be seen on the digital tier of Time Warner Cable in the greater Wilmington area since that market&#x27;s MyNetworkTV affiliate, W47CK, was technically ineligible for carriage on cable providers due to its low-powered status. As a result, the clearance allowed WITN-DT2 to unofficially serve as Wilmington&#x27;s MeTV outlet (since, at that time, there was no television outlet affiliated with the network in that area). Eventually, Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum) picked up W47CK and subsequently dropped WITN-DT2 from the lineup.

==News operation==
In terms of Nielsen ratings, Eastern North Carolina is usually not very competitive during sweeps periods. Historically, WITN has been the #1 ranked newscast in the Greenville–Washington–New Bern market.

The station&#x27;s direct competitors are WCTI-TV and WNCT-TV. There have been occasions that WITN has come in 2nd place in ratings. WITN News ranked 2nd in the market to WCTI in 2014, before regaining 1st place in 2015. In July 2008, WNCT was the most watched television station in the market after taking first place weeknights at 6 and 11. However, since then, WNCT has fallen to 3rd place weeknights at 6.

While broadcasting from its original facility in Chocowinity, WITN maintained secondary studios in Greenville on East Arlington Boulevard (within the Square Shopping Center) less than two blocks from its current base of operations. This location began broadcasting a weekday morning newscast in 1997 featuring a news anchor, meteorologist, and photographer based out of there. In addition, weeknight interview segments were conducted from the old secondary studios.

After moving into its brand new facility in Greenville on June 5, 2013, WITN became the area&#x27;s second television outlet to upgrade news production to high definition level. In addition to its main studios in Greenville, the station operates news bureaus in Jacksonville (on Valencia Drive) and in New Bern (on Middle Street).

===Notable former on-air staff===
* John Beard – news anchor (1972-1976; most recently at WGRZ in Buffalo, New York, leaving that station January 18, 2018. 
* David Crabtree – anchor/reporter (1985–1988; now at WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina)
* Susan Roesgen – now at WGNO in New Orleans

Because the village built along the river is also distant from the capital, , it was given the name , as a play-on-words meaning village of the river
distant from any ports or the capital. The word used for the first kanji in the current name, , and the original name for the river, , as well as the word for capital, , all contain a reading of &quot;to&quot;.

===End of Kamakura and Muromachi period===
In 1333, Emperor Go-Daigo overthrew the Kamakura Shogunate and thus began the Kenmu Restoration. However, many samurai, including Ashikaga Takauji were dissatisfied with the new policies, and so a struggle ensued between them and the emperor. As a result of the struggle, the emperor fled to Yamato Province, which composed much of present-day Nara Prefecture and included Totsukawa within. There he established the Southern Court. Totsukawa was deeply intertwined with the southern court, and Prince Morinaga once sought refuge there. Old documents written by the second emperor of the court, Gomurakami and Morinaga&#x27;s son, Prince Okura are still kept and preserved within the village, and contain directives to the people of the village to assist the southern court. The people were said to be skilled martial artists and hunters, which is attributed to their recognition by multiple successive emperors within southern court.

In 1873, the land tax law was changed, and Totsukawa became taxes as well, instituting a plethora of changes to follow.

In 1889, a major flood happened in Totsukawa, causing widespread destruction. In result, many citizens moved to Hokkaido and developed a new village there. The first and then governor of Nara, Saisho Atsushi, issued a notice giving his respects and condolences, as well as informing them of disaster relief in the form of in gold from Emperor Meiji. The residents opted to name the new settlement “Shintotsukawa”, literally “New Totsukawa&quot;.

<text>The Audi TT is a production front-engine, 2-door, 2+2 sports coupé and roadster, manufactured and marketed by Audi from 1998 to 2023 across three generations. 

For each of its three generations, the TT has been based on consecutive generations of Volkswagen&#x27;s &quot;Group A&quot; platforms, starting with its &quot;PQ34&quot; fourth generation. The TT shares powertrain and suspension layouts with its platform mates, including the Audi A3, like a transversely mounted front-engine, powering front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, and fully independent suspension using MacPherson struts in front.

The TT&#x27;s first two generations were assembled by Audi&#x27;s Hungarian subsidiary, one of the world&#x27;s largest engine manufacturing plants, using bodyshells manufactured and painted at Audi&#x27;s Ingolstadt plant and parts made entirely by the Hungarian factory for the third generation.

The last of the 662,762 Audi TTs was manufactured in November 2023.

==Design==
Styling of the Audi TT began in the spring of 1994 at the Volkswagen Group Design Center in California. The TT was first shown as a concept car at the 1995 Frankfurt Motor Show. The design is credited to J Mays and Freeman Thomas, with Hartmut Warkuss, Peter Schreyer, Martin Smith and Romulus Rost contributing to the interior design.

A laser beam welding technique, which enabled seamless design features on the first-generation TT, delayed its introduction. Audi did not offer an automatic transmission option for the TT until 2003, when it offered a dual clutch six-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG), with the United Kingdom TT variants becoming the world&#x27;s first market for a dual clutch transmission configured for a right-hand drive vehicle, although the outright world first for a road car equipped with a dual clutch transmission was claimed earlier by a Volkswagen Group platform-mate, the left hand drive Volkswagen Golf Mk4 R32.

==Name==
The Audi TT takes its name from the Isle of Man TT (Tourist Trophy) motorcycle race — where NSU, Audi&#x27;s predecessor, had enjoyed considerable motor racing success. NSU marque began competing at the Isle of Man TT in 1907 with the UK manager Martin Geiger finishing in fifth position in the single-cylinder race. The 1938 Isle of Man Lightweight TT race was won by Ewald Kluge with a 250 cc supercharged DKW motor-cycle and the DKW and NSU companies later merged into the company now known as Audi. The Audi TT also follows the NSU 1000TT, 1200TT and TTS cars of the 1960s in taking their names from the race. 

The &quot;TT&quot; nameplate has also been attributed to the phrase &quot;Technology &amp; Tradition&quot;.

==TT Mk1 (&quot;Type&quot; 8N, 1998–2006)==


The production model (internal designation &quot;Type&quot; 8N) was launched as a coupé in September 1998, followed by a roadster in August 1999. It is based on the Volkswagen Group A4 (PQ34) platform as used for the Volkswagen Golf Mk4, the original Audi A3, the Škoda Octavia, and others. The styling differed little from the concept, except for slightly reprofiled bumpers, and the addition of rear quarterlight windows behind the doors. Factory production commenced in October 1998.

Early TTs were cited in a series of fatalities from accidents involving speeds over , abrupt lane changes or sharp turns. Both the coupé and roadster variants were recalled in late 1999/early 2000, to improve the car&#x27;s handling predictability at very high speeds. Audi&#x27;s Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) or Anti Slip Regulation (ASR) were added, as well as a rear spoiler, along with modifications to the suspension system. All changes were incorporated into subsequent production.

The Audi TT was nominated for the &quot;North American Car of the Year&quot; award for 2000 and made &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 2000 and 2001. By 2003, Audi revised the TT, with a number of small styling and practicality improvements.

Production of the first generation (Type 8N) ended in June 2006.

===Powertrain===
Mechanically, the TT shares an identical powertrain layout with its related Volkswagen Group-mates. The TT uses a transversely mounted internal combustion engine, with either front-wheel drive or &#x27;quattro four-wheel drive&#x27; available as an option. It was first available with a 1.8-litre inline four-cylinder 20-valve turbocharged engine in two states of DIN-rated power outputs; and . The engines share the same fundamental design, but the 225 PS version features a larger K04 turbocharger (180 PS version came with a smaller K03), an additional intercooler on the left side (complementing the existing right-side intercooler), larger 20mm wrist-pins, a dual tailpipe exhaust, intake manifold with inlet on driver&#x27;s side, and a few other internals – designed to accommodate the increase in turbo boost, from roughly peak, to . Haldex Traction enabled four-wheel drive, branded &quot;Quattro&quot;, was optional on the 180 engine and standard on the more powerful 225 version.

The original four-cylinder engine range was complemented with a VR6 engine rated at and of torque in early 2003, which came as standard with the quattro four-wheel-drive system. In July 2003, a new six-speed dual clutch transmission – dubbed the Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG), which improves acceleration through much-reduced shift times, was offered, along with a stiffer suspension.

===Aerodynamics===
According to Audi Head of Design Marc Lichte, the curved outline and rounded bodywork of the Mk1 TT&#x27;s design was inspired by Bauhaus. This simplified curved shape was unusual at the time. The drag coefficient of the original TT is 0.35, which is similar to its competitors such as the BMW Z4 and the Mazda MX-5.

However, the TT was involved in a number of high-speed accidents which were attributed to aerodynamic instability at high speeds. To solve these issues, Audi added modified control arms and firmer shock absorbers on both the front and rear suspension as well as a rear spoiler.

===TT quattro Sport===
In 2005, Audi released the Coupé-only limited edition. Just 1,165 were produced. 800 with steering wheel on the right side, 365 with steering wheel on the left side. (900 sold in the UK, not the 1,000 originally planned) (known as the in Europe) or TT QS. Built by AUDI AG&#x27;s high-performance specialist subsidiary quattro GmbH, it had increased power from its 1.8-litre turbocharged engine – rising to and of torque – and a reduction in weight of to , which allowed for a time of 5.9 seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of .

This weight reduction was achieved by removing the spare wheel, rear harmonic damper, rear parcel shelf and rear seats, and the standard fitment air conditioning. The main battery was also relocated to the rear of the vehicle in order to maintain weight distribution as much as possible. Lightweight fixed-back Recaro bucket seats graced the interior. Distinguishable from other TT Coupés by its two-tone paint scheme (Phantom Black pearl painted roof, pillars and mirror housings, in combination with either Avus Silver, Phantom Black, Mauritius Blue or Misano Red body colour) and unique 18&quot; 15-spoke cast aluminium alloy wheels, plus the same body kit as fitted to the TT 3.2 V6, the TT quattro Sport also featured black exhaust tailpipes and uprated suspension settings and new wheels, wider at the rear for improved handling. The brochure stated V6-spec brakes were to be fitted, however models delivered in the UK came with the standard 225 spec brake callipers which were red-painted.

===8N engines===
The 8N powertrain options consist of the following engines and drivelines:
===Lawsuits===
In June 2007, a class action lawsuit was filed against Volkswagen Group of America, alleging the timing belts for model year 1999–2003 Audi and Volkswagen vehicles equipped with a 1.8-litre turbocharged engine failed prematurely. The complaint alleged that the timing belts failed prior to the owner&#x27;s manual&#x27;s service interval. The parties reached a class-wide settlement, with preliminary approval of the settlement granted in May 2008.

In May 2008, a class action suit reached a nationwide settlement regarding allegedly defective instrument clusters on 2000–2004, and 2005 model year Audi TTs. Owners were entitled to submit claims for repairs, replacement and/or cash reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses and received a two-year instrument cluster warranty extension.

=== 2.7T Quattro gmbH Concept ===
For the 30th anniversary Quattro gmbH unveiled an Imola Yellow TT that sported a 2.7 L Bi-Turbo V6 engine from a B5 Audi RS4 that produced and at 2,500 rpm which was manufactured in 2001. This was accomplished by using a B5 RS4 donor car, which included engine, transmission, rear differential, axles, brakes, and wheels from a B5 Avant. Using the RS4 drivetrain, Audi had the ability to utilize a Torsen based 6-speed Quattro manual transmission in a car that is normally using a transverse engine layout and Haldex based all wheel drive system.

==TT Mk2 (&quot;Type&quot; 8J, 2006–2014)==

In August 2004, Audi announced that the next generation TT would be manufactured using aluminium, and would go into production in 2007. A preview of the second-generation TT was provided in the form of the Audi Shooting Brake concept car, shown at the Tokyo Motor Show in 2005. This concept was an insight into the new TT, but featured angular styling, and a &quot;shooting-brake&quot; two-door hatchback body style.

Audi debuted the second-generation TT, internal designation &quot;Type&quot; 8J, on 6 April 2006, using the Volkswagen Group A5 (PQ35) platform with aluminium front bodypanels, and steel in the rear, to enhance its near-neutral front-to-rear weight distribution. Available in front-wheel drive or &quot;quattro&quot; four-wheel drive layout, the TT was again offered as a 2+2 Coupé, and as a two-seater Roadster. The second generation was five inches longer and three inches wider than its predecessor. Factory production commenced during August 2006.

===8J powertrain===
The powertrain options initially only included petrol engines, which consist of either one of two inline four-cylinder engines – the new 1.8-litre EA888 Turbocharged Fuel Stratified Injection (TFSI) (available initially only in Germany, later elsewhere from mid 2009), or the more common and established EA113-variant 2.0-litre TFSI. The Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) technology was derived from the Audi Le Mans endurance race cars, and offers improved fuel efficiency as well as an increased power output and cleaner emissions. The 3.2-litre &#x27;V6&#x27; badged VR6 engine was carried over from the previous generation. 2.0 TFSI quattro models, with the latest EA888 engine, became available in 2009 model year.

A six-speed manual transmission is standard, with the six-speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (now called &quot;S-TRONIC&quot; on all Audi models) as an option for all engines. Quattro on-demand four-wheel drive, again using the Haldex Traction clutch is available – standard on V6 models, but not available on the 1.8 TFSI.

===8J suspension and other features===
Like all its PQ35 platform-mates, the 8J TT has a multi-link fully independent rear suspension to complement the front independent suspension. The entire suspension system can be enhanced with Audi&#x27;s new active suspension, &quot;Audi Magnetic Ride&quot;, available as an option. This is based on BWI Group&#x27;s MagneRide, which uses magneto rheological dampers (this means that an electronic control unit for the suspension will automatically adjust its damping properties depending on the current road conditions and driving manner).

The new TT also features a revised rear spoiler which preserves the clean aesthetics of the TT when not raised. The spoiler automatically deploys at 125 km/h (78 mph) to increase down-force, and retracts again below 80 km/h (50 mph).
The spoiler can be manually controlled via a switch on the lower centre console. Manual operation by the switch reverts to automatic operation (i.e.: manual mode is cancelled) if the vehicle speed rises above the stated limit.

===2.0 TDI quattro===
Launched at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show, Audi offered the first diesel engined version of the Audi TT in the European market, the . As its name indicates, it is only available with four-wheel-drive, and is also available in Coupé and Roadster versions. Power comes from the new 2.0-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) engine, now with 16 valves, double overhead camshaft (DOHC), common rail fuel delivery and eight-hole piezo fuel injectors, which produces a DIN-rated output of at 4,200 rpm and torque of at 1,750 to 2,500 rpm. It includes a six-speed manual transmission.

Acceleration from standstill to on the Coupé is achieved in 7.5 seconds, and it will go on to reach a top speed of . The slightly less aerodynamically efficient Roadster reaches in 7.7 seconds, with a top speed of .

Audi claims average fuel consumption for the Coupé variant with this 2.0 TDI engine is , which achieves a CO2 emissions rating of 139 gram/km. The Roadster TDI achieves an average and CO2 of 144 gram/km.

===TT S-Line===
As an additional package a standard Audi TT can be bought from factory with a special body kit upgrade to make it look like the Audi TT-RS version. The upgrade includes a fixed rear spoiler, and Alcantara/leather sports seats (Silk Nappa, Fine Nappa leather optional).
===TTS===

At the 2008 North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) in Detroit, Audi released the first Audi &quot;S&quot; model of the TT range – the Audi TTS quattro, with a heavily revised 2.0 TFSI engine. The cylinder block, cylinder head and the fuel injectors have all been modified from the base 2.0 TFSI engine (ID: CDL). Together with other modifications, this engine produces a DIN-rated power output of , and generates a torque of from 2,500 to 5,000 rpm.

It was available with a choice of either a six-speed close-ratio manual transmission, or a six-speed &#x27;S tronic&#x27; transmission. In the United States, the S tronic gearbox was the only available transmission. Like all Audi &quot;S&quot; models, it was only available with four-wheel drive as standard.

The suspension was lowered by over the standard models, and includes &quot;Audi Magnetic Ride&quot; as standard and a new two-stage sports-biased Electronic Stability Programme (ESP). Radially ventilated front disc brakes are clamped by a single-piston gloss black caliper emblazoned with a bold &quot;TTS&quot; logo, and a lap timer is prominent in the centre of the instrument cluster. 9Jx18&quot; &#x27;5-parallel-spoke&#x27; design alloy wheels are standard, with 245/40 ZR18 high-performance tyres. 19&quot; &#x27;5-spoke star&#x27; wheels and tyres are optional. The exterior has some changes over the standard model – with a TTS body styling: with redesigned front, with larger air intakes, redesigned rear bumper, side sill extensions, and four exhaust tailpipes.

Official performance figures include a 0-100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration time of 5.2 seconds, with the Roadster four-tenths slower at 5.6 seconds.[31] Top speed is electronically limited to .

Audi UK offered eight TTS cars for official use by the race organisers at the 2008 Isle of Man TT motorcycle races.

The car went on sale in the US at November 2008.

In 2014, at the International Motor Show in Geneva, Audi unveiled the new TTS model for the 2016 model year, alongside the standard 2016 Audi TT model. Both models were planned to go on sale in the beginning of 2015.

===TT Clubsport quattro concept===
Audi displayed a new show car variant of the second generation Audi TT – the Audi TT Clubsport quattro, at the 2008 Wörthersee Tour at Pörtschach am Wörthersee in Austria. Shown only in an open-topped &quot;speedster&quot; variant, its 2.0 TFSI engine has been tuned to give . The soft-top on the standard TT Roadster has been deleted, and replaced with two &quot;humps&quot;, along with two substantial roll bars. LED daytime running lamps, an aggressive body kit with large frontal air intakes, black-painted &quot;single frame grille&quot; and a lower spoiler lip complete the new look from the front. The axle track has been widened by , with bolder and wider wheel arch extensions, polished 19-inch alloys, wider side sills and 255-section tyres are the highlight of the side profile. At the rear, twin polished stainless steel oval tail pipes exit aside a new rear diffuser.

Racing bucket seats, along with lightweight aluminium detail complete the interior look, and a six-speed S tronic dual-clutch transmission with quattro four-wheel drive and TTS spec brakes ( up front, and at the rear) complete the mechanicals.

Whilst the TT Clubsport quattro is primarily a &quot;show car&quot;, Audi has not ruled out the possibility of small-scale production.

===TT RS===

With its world debut at the 2009 Geneva Auto Show, and developed by Audi&#x27;s high-performance subsidiary quattro GmbH at Neckarsulm, Germany, Audi released the first compact sports car Audi &quot;RS&quot; variant – the , which was available from 2009 in Coupé and Roadster variants. The TT RS featured a new 2.5-litre Inline-5 turbocharged petrol engine. This engine produces a DIN-rated power output of from 5,400 to 6,700 rpm, and torque of at 1,600–5,300 rpm.

Ever since the original Audi &quot;RS&quot; model – the Audi RS2 Avant – all Audi &quot;RS&quot; models were assembled at the quattro GmbH factory in Neckarsulm. The TT RS is the first Audi RS vehicle that didn&#x27;t have any of its assembly performed in Neckarsulm but was completely assembled in the Audi factory in Győr, Hungary, alongside the base Audi TT.

The TT RS has a new short-shift close-ratio six-speed manual transmission, and like all &quot;RS&quot; models, is only available with four-wheel-drive, with the TT RS using a specially adapted version of the latest generation multi-plate clutch from Haldex Traction. Additions to the quattro system include a constant velocity joint before the cardan propeller shaft, and a compact rear-axle differential – upgraded to cope with the increased torque from the five-cylinder turbo engine.

Like the TTS, the TT RS has a lower ride height, optional &quot;Audi Magnetic Ride&quot;, and rides on standard 18-inch wheels with 245/45 ZR18 tyres (optional 19&quot; or 20&quot; wheels are also available). The brakes are upgraded to include two-piece cross-drilled and radially vented front discs, sized at in diameter. The front discs are clamped by gloss black painted four-piston calipers, adorned with the &quot;RS&quot; logo. Rear ventilated discs are sized at in diameter.

It includes a fixed rear spoiler (retractable optional), and has black interior with heated Alcantara/leather sports seats (Silk Nappa, Fine Nappa leather optional). The Recaro &quot;RS bucket&quot; seats, first seen in the Audi B7 RS4 are also available as an option. Also carried over from the B7 RS4 is the &quot;Sport&quot; button, which sharpens the throttle response and deepens the exhaust note, and a three-stage user-selectable Electronic Stability Programme (ESP).

Official performance figures indicate the TT RS Coupé will accelerate from a standstill to in 4.5 seconds (4.7 seconds for the Roadster), with an electronically limited top speed of . There is a factory option to de-restrict the top speed to . The Coupé has a kerb weight of , and the Roadster weighs in at .

As of 2010, the TT-RS is available with the 7-speed DSG automatic transmission capable of handling the torque delivered by the engine. The 6-speed gearbox used in the TT-S cannot cope with of torque, which is why the TT-RS initially was offered only with a manual transmission.

The car went on sale in March 2009, with delivery beginning in summer.

In 2010, the TT-RS was confirmed for the US market. The decision was influenced by an internet petition to bring the TT-RS stateside, which succeeded with over 11,000 signatures. The TT-RS arrived in Q3 2011 as a 2012 model.

In 2012, the TT RS plus was launched. It featured the uprated version of the TT RS&#x27; engine that had originally been developed for the RS Q3 concept car; this version of the engine produces at 5500 rpm, and of torque at 1650 rpm. As a result of this power increase, Audi claimed that the 0- time had decreased to 4.3 seconds for the manual version, and 4.1 seconds for the S-tronic version. In addition to this, Audi raised the top speed limiter, with the TT RS plus being restricted to .

===8J engines===
The 8J powertrain options consist of the following engines and drivelines:
Audi was reported to stop offering 3.2-litre V6 (&quot;VR6&quot;) models in North America from 2010 model year.

===8J awards===
The second generation TT has been honoured with many awards, including the inaugural &quot;Drive Car of the Year&quot;, &quot;Top Gear&quot; &quot;Coupé of the Year 2006&quot;, &quot;Fifth Gear&quot; &quot;Car of the Year 2006&quot;, Autobild &quot;Most Beautiful Car&quot;, and &quot;World Design Car of the Year 2007&quot;, as well as being a finalist for &quot;World Car of the Year&quot;. In addition, an HPA-prepared version of the car was the winner of the SEMA Gran Turismo Award in 2007. The Audi TT has been the &quot;What Car?&quot; &quot;best Coupe of the Year&quot; for six consecutive years since 2007.

A 2019 iSeeCars study named the TT as the longest-lasting sports car most likely to exceed 150,000 miles.
==TT Mk3 (&quot;Type&quot; FV/8S, 2014–2023)==
Like its predecessor, the Audi TT FV/8S was previewed in the form of the Audi Allroad Shooting Brake concept car, shown at the Detroit Motor Show in 2014.

The third generation of the TT was unveiled at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show. The FV/8S generation utilises the Volkswagen Group MQB platform, and is available with a choice of TFSI and TDI engines. The 2.0 TFSI is available in two versions: a version producing and of torque in the TT and a version producing and of torque in the TTS. A 2.0 TDI Inline-four engine producing and of torque is also available as an option for the TT. The TFSI engines are available with all wheel drive. The TDI comes in front wheel drive configuration, but was then later released with the Audi&#x27;s quattro all wheel drive.

In 2019, the models were updated with the following specifications:
* TT 40: with a 2.0L engine producing and of torque 
* TT 45: with a 2.0L engine producing and of torque 
* TTS (from 2019 until 2021): with a 2.0L engine producing and of torque 
* TTS (from 2021 until 2023): with a 2.0L engine producing and of torque 
* TT RS: with a 2.5L engine producing and of torque 

The third generation Audi TT features temperature and airflow controls embedded in the air-vents.

In the US, this generation was available from Model Year 2016 onward.
It was announced in May 2019 that the current generation TT would be the last, and it would be discontinued at the end of the model&#x27;s lifecycle.


===TT RS===
In 2016, the MQB-based Audi TT RS coupé and roadster were announced with the five-cylinder 2.5 litre TFSI engine now producing and of torque between 1,700 and 5,850 rpm. Audi&#x27;s all-wheel drive quattro system is the standard layout and the only transmission option is the 7-speed S tronic automatic transmission.

===Special editions===
====TT RS Heritage Edition====
Audi discontinued the TT RS in the United States after the 2022 model year, so they released the TT RS Heritage Edition, a special edition available in five colors and produced in just 50 units. Ten of each color will be made, each color representing a Ur-Quattro rally champion:

The air vents, armrests, and center console of the coupe are adorned with Tango Red accents. The Alcantara-trimmed seats feature red stitching, and the floor mats receive red piping as well. The Final Edition is exclusive to the United Kingdom, with Audi confirming that it will not be available in North America.

==Motorsport==
In auto racing, the Istook&#x27;s Motorsports team has currently entered a Revo Technik-sponsored Audi TT in the Grand-Am KONI Sports Car Challenge Street Tuner (ST) class.

Under the racing name of RS Werkes, Istook&#x27;s Motorsports out of Fort Worth, Texas, built and raced the first TT RS brought into the United States in the Grand Am GS class in 2012, 2013 and 2014.

An Audi TT RS was used at the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans race as the safety car.

The Abt Sportsline team entered a TT into the DTM, and Laurent Aïello took the title in 2002.
Istook&#x27;s Motorsports has also raced the TT in SCCA&#x27;s World Challenge race series. Because of their racing involvement, they received the first U.S. Version of the TT-RS in July 2011.

==Audi TT Offroad==
The Audi TT Offroad Concept was unveiled as an SUV concept version of the Audi TT at the 2014 Auto China. The SUV utilized a hybrid system coupled with the 2.0-litre TFSI Inline-4 engine producing a total of and of torque. The SUV utilises a 6-speed dual clutch automatic transmission. The hybrid system consists of a electric motor on the front axle and an electric motor on the rear axle. In full EV mode, the vehicle uses the rear motor only; Hybrid and Sport modes utilise all three power sources, and all-wheel-drive traction is applied as needed. Performance figures include a acceleration time of 5.2 seconds and an electronically limited top speed of . The distinguishing features of the concept include matrix LED headlights and two new assistance systems: One that scans intersections for potentially dangerous situations, and a second that connects to a municipality&#x27;s traffic-light system in order to recommend a perfect speed to reach the next light when it is green. The interior is relatively close to the TT&#x27;s with leather upholstery from Italian fashion brand Poltrona Frau and features a high-tech TFT display in front of the driver populated with the information that would normally be projected onto a central, dash-mounted screen—i.e. navigation, entertainment.

<text>Robert Peapo &quot;Peabo&quot; Bryson ( ; born April 13, 1951) is an American singer and songwriter. He is known for singing soul ballads (often as a duet with female singers) including the hit singles &quot;Tonight, I Celebrate My Love&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Looking Like Love To Me&quot; and &quot;As Long As There&#x27;s Christmas&quot; with Roberta Flack, &quot;A Whole New World&quot; with Regina Belle, and &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; with Canadian singer Celine Dion. Bryson has contributed to two Disney animated feature soundtracks. Bryson is a winner of two Grammy Awards.

==Early years==
Born as Robert Peapo Bryson in Greenville, South Carolina, he spent much of his childhood on his grandfather&#x27;s farm in Mauldin, South Carolina. Bryson&#x27;s love for music stemmed from his mother, who often took the family to concerts of well-known black artists at the time.

==Career==
Bryson marked his professional debut at the age of 14, singing backup for Al Freeman and the Upsetters, a local Greenville group. It was Freeman&#x27;s difficulty in pronouncing Bryson&#x27;s French West-Indian name, Peapo, that led Bryson to perform as Peabo. Two years later, he left home to tour the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit with another local band, Moses Dillard and the Tex-Town Display. Bryson&#x27;s first break came during a recording session at Atlanta&#x27;s Bang Records. Although Bang was not impressed with Dillard&#x27;s band, the young backup singer caught the ear of the label&#x27;s general manager, Eddie Biscoe. Biscoe signed Bryson to a contract as a writer, producer, and arranger and encouraged Bryson to perform his own songs. For several years, Bryson worked with hometown bands and wrote and produced for Bang. In 1976, he launched his own recording career with &quot;Underground Music&quot; on the Bang label. His first album, &quot;Peabo&quot;, followed shortly thereafter. Although only a regional success, Bryson signed to Capitol Records in 1977.

Bryson&#x27;s greatest solo hits include 1977&#x27;s &quot;Feel the Fire&quot; and &quot;Reaching for the Sky&quot;, 1978&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m So into You&quot; and &quot;Crosswinds&quot;, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Let the Feeling Flow&quot;, 1984&#x27;s &quot;If Ever You&#x27;re in My Arms Again&quot; (his first Top 10 pop single, at No. 10 in the US), 1989&#x27;s &quot;Show and Tell&quot;, and the 1991 hit &quot;Can You Stop the Rain&quot;. In 1985, he appeared on the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; to sing a lyrical version of its theme song. Bryson&#x27;s vocals were added to the regular theme song in 1986 and his voice was heard daily until 1992. He recorded the successful album of romantic love duets with Roberta Flack (&quot;Born to Love&quot;) in 1983. In partnership with Regina Belle, Bryson recorded two hit duets: &quot;Without You&quot;, the love theme from the comedy film &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot;, recorded in 1987, and &quot;A Whole New World&quot;, the main theme of the Disney&#x27;s animated feature film &quot;Aladdin&quot;, recorded in 1992. Bryson and Belle recorded four duets over the years: &quot;Without You&quot; (in 1987), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Imagine&quot; (in 1991), &quot;A Whole New World&quot; (in 1992) and &quot;Total Praise&quot; (in 2009).

Bryson won two Grammy Awards: in 1992 for his performance of the song &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; with Celine Dion and in 1993 for &quot;A Whole New World&quot; with Regina Belle.

In early 1998, Bryson contributed his voice to &quot;Barney&#x27;s Great Adventure: An Original Motion Picture Musical Soundtrack&quot;, with the song &quot;Dream (Twinken&#x27;s Tune)&quot;.

Bryson performed in theater and operatic productions, most notably the tenor role of &quot;Sportin&#x27; Life&quot; in the Michigan Opera Theater of Detroit&#x27;s version of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. His tax problems caught up with him on August 21, 2003, when the U.S. Internal Revenue Service seized property from his home in Atlanta, Georgia. He is reported to have owed $1.2 million in taxes dating back to 1984. The IRS auctioned many of his possessions, including both Grammy Awards, electronic equipment, his grand piano and multiple pairs of shoes.

In 2002, Bryson&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; music video was included on the platinum and Blu-ray edition of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. His &quot;A Whole New World&quot; music video was included on the platinum edition DVD release of &quot;Aladdin&quot;. Bryson&#x27;s CD &quot;Missing You&quot; was released on October 2, 2007, on Peak Records, a division of Concord Music Group.

On September 4, 2016, it was declared &quot;Peabo Bryson Day&quot; in Charleston, South Carolina and North Charleston, South Carolina, during the LowCountryJazzFest. The annual jazzfest is presented by ClosingTheGapInHealthCare.org, founded by Dr. Thaddeus Bell.

In 2018, Bryson released his new album &quot;Stand For Love&quot;, which was produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. The project was released on Jam &amp; Lewis&#x27; newly reactivated label, Perspective Records.

==Personal life==
Before marrying his present wife, singer and member of English R&amp;B group The 411 Tanya Boniface, Bryson was engaged several times to Juanita Leonard, the ex-wife of boxing great Sugar Ray Leonard. In the 1990s, he became engaged to Angela Thigpen, former Miss Virginia Teen USA and later a model and actress. He has a daughter from a previous relationship, along with three grandchildren.

Tax problems caught up with Bryson on August 21, 2003, when the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seized property from his Atlanta, Georgia, home. He is reported to have owed $1.2 million in taxes dating back to 1984. The IRS auctioned many of his possessions, including both Grammy Awards, electronic equipment, his grand piano and multiple pairs of shoes; however, his Grammy for &quot;A Whole New World (Aladdin&#x27;s Theme)&quot; was purchased by a close friend of the family who vowed to return it to Bryson.

On April 29, 2019, it was reported that Bryson had suffered a heart attack, and had been taken to an Atlanta hospital, where he was said to be in a stable condition. He has since made a full recovery.

<doc id="556202" wikidata="Q598601" url="?curid=556202" title="Xanthium">
<text>Xanthium (cocklebur) is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Heliantheae within the family Asteraceae, native to the Americas and eastern Asia and some parts of south Asia.

==Description==
Cockleburs are coarse, herbaceous annual plants growing to tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, with deeply toothed margins. Some species, notably &quot;Xanthium spinosum&quot;, are also very thorny with long, slender spines at the leaf bases.

The flower heads are of two types; One, in short terminal branches, produces only pollen. The other, in clusters in the axils of the leaves, produces seed.

Unlike many other members of the family Asteraceae, whose seeds are airborne with a plume of silky hairs resembling miniature parachutes, cocklebur seeds are produced in a hard, spiny, globose or oval double-chambered, single-seeded bur long. It is covered with stiff, hooked spines, which stick to fur and clothing and can be quite difficult to detach. These burs are carried long distances from the parent plant during seed dispersal by help of animals (zoochorous).

==Biology==
Cockleburs are short-day plants, meaning they only initiate flowering when the days are getting shorter in the late summer and fall, typically from July to October in the Northern Hemisphere. They can also flower in the tropics where the daylength is constant.

==Diversity==
Over 200 names have been proposed for species, subspecies, and varieties within the genus. Most of these are regarded as synonyms of highly variable species. Some recognize as few as two or three species in the genus. The Global Compositae Checklist recognizes the following.

;Accepted species
* &quot;Xanthium albinum&quot; – Mongolia
* &quot;Xanthium argenteum&quot; – Chile
* &quot;Xanthium catharticum&quot; – Chile, Bolivia, Argentina
* &quot;Xanthium cavanillesii&quot; – Argentina
* &quot;Xanthium inaequilaterum&quot; – China, India, Southeast Asia
* &quot;Xanthium mongolicum&quot; – Mongolia
* &quot;Xanthium orientale&quot; – Europe, North Africa, Middle East
* &quot;Xanthium pungens&quot; – Australia; naturalized in Eurasia
* &quot;Xanthium saccharosum&quot;
* &quot;Xanthium spinosum&quot; – spiny cocklebur, burreed, Bathurst burr – very widespread, nearly cosmopolitan
* &quot;Xanthium strumarium&quot; – clotbur, rough cocklebur, large cocklebur, common cocklebur – very widespread, nearly cosmopolitan

;formerly included
* see &quot;Ambrosia&quot;
* &quot;Xanthium artemisioides – Ambrosia arborescens&quot;
* &quot;Xanthium fruticosum – Ambrosia arborescens&quot;

==Legal status==
The cocklebur is legally listed as a noxious weed in the states of Arkansas and Iowa in the United States of America.

==Toxicity and uses==
The common cocklebur (&quot;Xanthium strumarium&quot;) is a native of North America. It has become an invasive species worldwide. It invades agricultural lands and can be poisonous to livestock, including horses, cattle, and sheep. Some domestic animals will avoid consuming the plant if other forage is present, but less discriminating animals, such as pigs, will consume the plants and then sicken and die. The seedlings and seeds are the most toxic parts of the plants. Symptoms usually occur within a few hours, producing unsteadiness and weakness, depression, nausea and vomiting, twisting of the neck muscles, rapid and weak pulse, difficulty breathing, and eventually death.

The plant also has been used for making yellow dye, hence the name of the genus (Greek &quot;xanthos&quot; means &#x27;yellow&#x27;). The many species of this plant, which can be found in many areas, may actually be varieties of two or three species. The seed oil is edible.

&quot;Xanthium strumarium&quot; is known as &quot;cang er zi&quot; (苍耳子) in traditional Chinese medicine. &quot;Xanthium&quot; is also used to treat nasal and sinus congestion.

The spines and seeds of this fruit are rich in a chemical called carboxyatractyloside (CAT), formerly referred to as xanthostrumarin, which is the chemical that is responsible for most of the adverse effects from the use of &quot;cang er zi&quot;. CAT has been shown to be a growth inhibitor in &quot;Xanthium&quot; and other plants, serving two functions, delaying seed germination and inhibiting the growth of other plants. Most of the chemical is concentrated in the spines. When the bur is prepared as an herbal remedy, the spines are usually removed, reducing the CAT content of the finished product.

<text>Alamo Village is a movie set and tourist attraction north of Brackettville, Texas, United States. It was the first movie location built in Texas, originally constructed for and best known as the setting for &quot;The Alamo&quot; (1960), directed by John Wayne and starring Wayne, Richard Widmark, Laurence Harvey and Frankie Avalon.

==History==
The set was built by James T. &quot;Happy&quot; Shahan of Brackettville, who in 1995 was named the &quot;Father of the Texas movie industry&quot; by Governor George W. Bush. Shahan began building the set on his ranch in September, 1957 for Wayne, who had tried for years to make a movie about the Battle of the Alamo for Republic Pictures, before finally breaking away to form Batjac Productions. Filming began in August, 1959.

Originally the set was to be facades of the front and sides of the buildings. However, Wayne ran out of money and called a halt to construction. Shahan agreed to continue working while Wayne raised more money, if Wayne would agree to building full sets with four walls, floor and roofs. Wayne signed on to the deal.

The set includes a full-scale re-creation of the Alamo compound as it would have appeared in 1836 (the real Alamo is in the middle of what is now Downtown San Antonio and is surrounded by modern skyscrapers). The set also includes a representation of the village of San Antonio de Béxar of the same time period. The building of the set required over 1.5 million adobe bricks (which were manufactured on site), 14 miles of gravel road and a 4,000-foot runway.
Shahan preserved the set after the end of the 1960 production and, over the years, over a dozen films about the Alamo have been shot there. In addition, over 100 other western movies as well as documentaries, music videos and commercials have been shot using various parts of the set. Frank Thompson, a film historian, noted that each production changed the set in some way, big or small, and that the changes appear in each new movie about the Alamo, documenting the current view of authenticity over time. The 2004 Disney movie about the Alamo was not shot on this set, but in a new set built in Dripping Springs, Texas.

After the filming of the 1960 version of &quot;The Alamo&quot;, the village has served primarily as a tourist attraction. For several decades, it served as a significant local employer and element of the economy of Brackettville. In addition to the replica of The Alamo, the village included a cantina and restaurant, a trading post, an Indian store, a church, a jail, a blacksmith shop, the John Wayne Western Museum, several museums, and a celebrity gallery. Alamo Village also maintained a collection of antique tools, vehicles and other period props, as well as a herd of longhorn cattle. During the summer, live music and stage shows performed frequently, and over Labor Day weekend the Labor Day Horse Races brought crowds to the village. Alamo Village was open to visitors year round except for December 21–26.

In 2004, the set was put up for sale by its owner, Virginia Shahan, Happy Shahan&#x27;s widow, for $3.0 million. Virginia Shahan died on June 23, 2009, at the age of 93. Alamo Village was closed to the public while her estate evaluated the feasibility of the Village&#x27;s continued operation in the midst of the late-2000s recession. Alamo Village temporarily re-opened after the death of owner Virginia Shahan but on September 28, 2009, Tulisha Shahan Wardlaw, Happy and Virginia&#x27;s daughter, died at the age of 67. Alamo Village then closed its doors and removed its website, ending an era.

Alamo Village reopened briefly for the summer in 2010 with limited hours and no shows, stores or restaurants, but closed again within a few months. Corpus Christi, Texas business man David Jones was in the process of raising funds to buy the site.

After an eight year closure, the site opened for a short time in late January 2018, possibly for the last time. The event was a liquidation sale of all of the props. A news item at the time indicated that the future of the site was undecided.

<text>The Kelham Island Brewery was a small independent brewery based in the Kelham Island Quarter area of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It closed down in May 2022.

However, the brewery was saved from closure in September, 2022, by a group led by the co-founder of the city&#x27;s Tramlines festival, James O&#x27;Hara, who was joined by his brother, financial analyst Tom, Simon Webster and Jim Harrison from Thornbridge Brewery, creative agency founder Peter Donohoe and Ben Rymer from beer festival organiser We Are Beer.
In 1990 the brewery was opened (the first for 100 years to open in Sheffield) on purpose-built premises on Alma Street by the owner of the Fat Cat public house, Dave Wickett. As well as the Fat Cat, the brewery owns a British-styled pub in Rochester, New York (United States), named the Old Toad.

Its beer &quot;Pale Rider&quot; won the &quot;Champion Beer of Britain&quot; award at the 2004 Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) organised Great British Beer Festival. 
The brewery is situated next to the Kelham Island Industrial Museum.

<doc id="556209" wikidata="Q737618" url="?curid=556209" title="Aldfrith of Northumbria">
<text>Aldfrith (Early Modern Irish: Flann Fína mac Ossu; Latin: &quot;Aldfrid&quot;, &quot;Aldfridus&quot;; died 14 December 704 or 705) was king of Northumbria from 685 until his death. He is described by early writers such as Bede, Alcuin and Stephen of Ripon as a man of great learning. Some of his works and some letters written to him survive. His reign was relatively peaceful, marred only by disputes with Bishop Wilfrid, a major figure in the early Northumbrian church.

Aldfrith was born on an uncertain date to Oswiu of Northumbria and an Irish princess named Fín. Oswiu later became King of Northumbria; he died in 670 and was succeeded by his son Ecgfrith. Aldfrith was educated for a career in the church and became a scholar. However, in 685, when Ecgfrith was killed at the battle of Nechtansmere, Aldfrith was recalled to Northumbria, reportedly from the Hebridean island of Iona, and became king.

In his early-8th-century account of Aldfrith&#x27;s reign, Bede states that he &quot;ably restored the shattered fortunes of the kingdom, though within smaller boundaries&quot;. His reign saw the creation of works of Hiberno-Saxon art such as the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Codex Amiatinus, and is often seen as the start of Northumbria&#x27;s golden age.

==Background and accession==
By the year 600, most of what is now England had been conquered by invaders from the continent, including Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Bernicia and Deira, the two Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the north of England, were first united under a single ruler in about 605 when Æthelfrith, king of Bernicia, extended his rule over Deira. Over the course of the 7th century, the two kingdoms were sometimes ruled by a single king, and sometimes separately. The combined kingdom became known as the kingdom of Northumbria: it stretched from the River Humber in the south to the River Forth in the north.

In 616, Æthelfrith was succeeded by Edwin of Northumbria, a Deiran. Edwin banished Æthelfrith&#x27;s sons, including both Oswald and Oswiu of Northumbria. Both spent their exile in Dál Riata, a kingdom spanning parts of northeastern Ireland and western Scotland. Oswiu was a child when he came to Dál Riata, and grew up in an Irish milieu. He became a fluent speaker of Old Irish, and may have married a princess of the Uí Néill dynasty, probably Fín the daughter (or possibly granddaughter) of Colmán Rímid. Aldfrith was a child of this marriage, but his date of birth is unrecorded. He was probably thus a cousin or nephew of the noted scholar Cenn Fáelad mac Aillila, and perhaps a nephew of Bishop Finan of Lindisfarne. Irish law made Fín&#x27;s kin, the Cenél nEógain of the northern Uí Néill, responsible for his upbringing. The relationship between Aldfrith&#x27;s father and mother was not considered a lawful marriage by Northumbrian churchmen of his day, and he is described as the son of a concubine in early sources.

Oswald and Oswiu returned to Northumbria after Edwin&#x27;s death in 633, and between them they ruled for much of the middle of the 7th century. The 8th-century monk and chronicler Bede lists both Oswald and Oswiu as having held &quot;imperium&quot;, or overlordship, over the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms; in Oswiu&#x27;s case his dominance extended beyond the Anglo-Saxons to the Picts, the Gaels of Dál Riata, and the many obscure and nameless native British kingdoms in what are now North West England and southern Scotland. Oswiu&#x27;s overlordship was ended in 658 by the rise of Wulfhere of Mercia, but his reign continued until his death in 670, when Ecgfrith, one of his sons by his second wife, Eanflæd, succeeded him. Ecgfrith was unable to recover Oswiu&#x27;s position in Mercia and the southern kingdoms, and was defeated by Wulfhere&#x27;s brother Æthelred in a battle on the River Trent in 679.

Ecgfrith sent an army under his general, Berht, to Ireland in 684 where he ravaged the plain of Brega, destroying churches and taking hostages. The raid may have been intended to discourage support for any claim Aldfrith might have to the throne, though other motives are possible.

Ecgfrith&#x27;s two marriages—the first to the saintly virgin Æthelthryth (Saint Audrey), the second to Eormenburh—produced no children. He had two full brothers: Alhfrith, who is not mentioned after 664, and Ælfwine, who was killed at the battle on the Trent in 679. Hence the succession in Northumbria was unclear for some years before Ecgfrith&#x27;s death. Bede&#x27;s &quot;Life of Cuthbert&quot; recounts a conversation between Cuthbert and Abbess Ælfflæd of Whitby, daughter of Oswiu, in which Cuthbert foresaw Ecgfrith&#x27;s death. When Ælfflæd asked about his successor, she was told she would love him as a brother:

Cuthbert, later considered a saint, was a second cousin of Aldfrith (according to Irish genealogies), which may have been the reason for his proposal as monarch.

Ecgfrith was killed during a campaign against his cousin, the King of the Picts Bridei map Beli, at a battle known as Nechtansmere to the Northumbrians, in Pictish territory north of the Firth of Forth. Bede recounts that Queen Eormenburh and Cuthbert were visiting Carlisle that day, and that Cuthbert had a premonition of the defeat. Ecgfrith&#x27;s death threatened to break the hold of the descendants of Æthelfrith on Northumbria, but the scholar Aldfrith became king and the thrones of Bernicia and Deira remained united.

Although rival claimants of royal descent must have existed, there is no recorded resistance to Aldfrith&#x27;s accession. It has also been suggested that Aldfrith&#x27;s ascent was eased by support from Dál Riata, the Uí Néill, and the Picts, all of whom might have preferred the mature, known quantity of Aldfrith to an unknown and more warlike monarch, such as Ecgfrith or Oswiu had been. The historian Herman Moisl, for example, wrote that &quot;Aldfrith was in Iona in the year preceding the battle [of Nechtansmere]; immediately afterwards, he was king of Northumbria. It is quite obvious that he must have been installed by the Pictish-Dál Riatan alliance&quot;. Subsequently, a battle between the Northumbrians and the Picts in which Berht was killed is recorded by Bede and the Irish annals in 697 or 698. Overall, Aldfrith appears to have abandoned his predecessors&#x27; attempts to dominate Northumbria&#x27;s neighbours.

==Aldfrith&#x27;s Northumbria==
Bede, paraphrasing Virgil, wrote that following Ecgfrith&#x27;s death, &quot;the hopes and strengths of the English realm began &#x27;to waver and slip backward ever lower&#x27;&quot;. The Northumbrians never regained the dominance of central Britain lost in 679, or of northern Britain lost in 685. Nonetheless, Northumbria remained one of the most powerful states of Britain and Ireland well into the Viking Age.

Aldfrith ruled both Bernicia and Deira throughout his reign, but the two parts remained distinct, and would again be divided by the Vikings in the late 9th century. The centre of Bernicia lay in the region around the later Anglo-Scottish border, with Lindisfarne, Hexham, Bamburgh, and Yeavering being important religious and royal centres. Even after Ecgfrith&#x27;s death, Bernicia included much of modern southeast Scotland, with a presumed royal centre at Dunbar, and religious centres at Coldingham and Melrose. The details of the early Middle Ages in northwest England and southwest Scotland are more obscure, but a Bishop of Whithorn is known from shortly after Aldfrith&#x27;s reign. York, Catterick, Ripon, and Whitby appear to have been important sites in Deira.

Northumbria&#x27;s southern frontier with Mercia ran across England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears to show that it was a defended border, with large earthworks set back from the frontier. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith&#x27;s general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.

==Relations with the Church==
Along with the king, royal family, and chief noblemen, the church was a major force in Northumbria. Churchmen were not only figures of spiritual authority, they were major landowners, who also controlled trade, centred at major churches and monasteries in a land without cities and towns. The bishopric of Lindisfarne was held by Cuthbert at Aldfrith&#x27;s accession; Cuthbert was succeeded by the Irish-educated Eadberht, who would later be Abbot of Iona and bring the Easter controversy to an end, and then by Eadfrith, creator of the Lindisfarne Gospels. The bishops of Lindisfarne sometimes held the see of Hexham, but during Aldfrith&#x27;s reign it was held by John of Beverley, a pupil and protégé of Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The bishopric of York was held by Bosa in 685. Wilfrid was given the see in 687, but removed in 691 with Bosa returning to York. The short-lived see at Abercorn, created in 681 for Bishop Trumwine, collapsed in the period after Ecgfrith&#x27;s death and the first known Bishop of Whithorn was appointed in the reign of King Ceolwulf. Important monasteries existed at Whitby, where the known abbesses tended to be members of the Deiran royal family, at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, where Bede was a monk, and at Ripon.

Aldfrith appears to have had the support of leading ecclesiastics, most notably his half-sister Ælfflæd and the highly respected Bishop Cuthbert. He is known to have received confirmation at the hands of Aldhelm, later the Bishop of Sherborne in the south-western Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Wessex. Aldhelm too had received an Irish education, but in Britain, at Malmesbury. Correspondence between the two survives, and Aldhelm sent Aldfrith his treatise on the numerology of the number seven, the &quot;Epistola ad Acircium&quot;. Aldfrith also owned a manuscript on cosmography, which (according to Bede) he purchased from Abbot Ceolfrith of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow in exchange for an estate valued at eight hides. Aldfrith was a close friend of Adomnán, Abbot of Iona from 679, and may have studied with him. In the 680s Aldfrith twice met with Adomnán, who came to seek the release of the Irish captives taken in Berht&#x27;s expedition of 684. These were released and Adomnán presented Aldfrith with a copy of his treatise &quot;De Locis Sanctis&quot; (&quot;On the Holy Places&quot;), a description of the places of pilgrimage in the Holy Land, and at Alexandria and Constantinople. Bede reports that Aldfrith circulated Adomnán&#x27;s work for others to read.

Bede described Aldfrith as a scholar, and his interest in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a &quot;sapiens&quot;, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. It implies a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king. Bede also makes it clear that the church in Aldfrith&#x27;s day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated from the time of Aldfrith&#x27;s death.

Aldfrith&#x27;s relations with the Church were, however, not always smooth. He inherited from Ecgfrith a troubled relationship with Wilfrid, a major ecclesiastical figure of the time. Wilfrid, the bishop of York, had been exiled by Ecgfrith for his role in persuading Ecgfrith&#x27;s wife, Æthelthryth, to remain a saintly celibate. In 686, at the urging of Archbishop Theodore, Aldfrith allowed Wilfrid to return. Aldfrith&#x27;s relations with Wilfrid were stormy; the hostility between the two was partly caused by Aldfrith&#x27;s allegiances with the Celtic Church, a consequence of his upbringing in exile. A more significant cause of strife was Wilfrid&#x27;s opposition to Theodore&#x27;s division, in 677, of his huge Northumbrian diocese. When Wilfrid returned from exile the reconciliation with Aldfrith did not include Aldfrith&#x27;s support for Wilfrid&#x27;s attempts to recover his episcopal authority over the whole of the north. By 691 or 692 their differences were beyond repair. Wilfrid&#x27;s hagiographer writes:

Wilfrid spent his exile in Mercia, where he enjoyed the staunch support of King Æthelred. In 702 or 703, Aldfrith convened a council at Austerfield, on the southern border of Northumbria, which was attended by Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury, and many bishops. The question of Wilfrid&#x27;s return to Northumbria was hotly debated and then rejected by the bishops. According to Stephen of Ripon, King Aldfrith offered to use his army to pressure Wilfrid into accepting the decision, but the bishops reminded him that he had promised Wilfrid safe-conduct. After returning to Mercia, Wilfrid was excommunicated by his enemies among the bishops. He responded by journeying to Rome, where he appealed in person to Pope John VI. The Pope provided him with letters to Aldfrith ordering that Wilfrid be restored to his offices. Aldfrith refused to receive the letters, and Wilfrid remained in disfavour.

==Northumbria&#x27;s Golden Age==
Aldfrith&#x27;s reign is considered the beginning of Northumbria&#x27;s Golden Age, which lasted until the end of the 8th century. The period saw the flowering of Insular art in Northumbria and produced the Lindisfarne Gospels, perhaps begun in Aldfrith&#x27;s time, the scholarship of Bede, and the beginnings of the Anglo-Saxon missions to the continent.

The Lindisfarne Gospels are believed to be the work of Eadfrith of Lindisfarne, bishop of Lindisfarne from 698. They are not the only surviving Northumbrian illuminated manuscripts from Aldfrith&#x27;s time. Also active at Lindisfarne in the late 7th century was the scribe known as the &quot;Durham-Echternach calligrapher&quot;, who produced the Durham Gospels and the Echternach Gospels. The Codex Amiatinus was a product of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, made on the orders of Abbot Ceolfrid, probably in the decade after Aldfrith&#x27;s death.

Two significant items of jewellery from Northumbria in this period have survived. The Ripon Jewel, discovered in the precincts of Ripon Cathedral in 1977, is difficult to date but its grandeur and the location of the find have suggested a link with Bishop Wilfrid, whose rich furnishings of the church at Ripon are on record. Bishop Cuthbert&#x27;s pectoral cross was buried with him during Aldfrith&#x27;s reign, either at his death in 687 or his reburial in 698 and is now at Durham Cathedral. There are few surviving architectural or monumental remains from the period. The Bewcastle Cross, the Ruthwell Cross and the Hexham Cross are probably to be dated to one or two generations after Aldfrith&#x27;s time. Escomb Church is the best preserved Northumbrian church of the period, dated to the late 7th century. The ruined chapel at Heysham, overlooking Morecambe Bay, may be somewhat later in date.

The Northumbrian coinage is thought to have begun during Aldfrith&#x27;s reign. Early silver coins, known as sceattas, appeared, replacing the impractical gold thrymsa as a medium of exchange. Exceptionally for the period, Aldfrith&#x27;s coins bear his name, rather than that of a moneyer, in an Irish uncial script. Most show a lion, with upraised tail.

==Heirs, death, and succession==
Aldfrith was married to Cuthburh, sister of King Ine of Wessex; the marriage thus allied Aldfrith with one of the most powerful kings in Anglo-Saxon England. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that Aldfrith and Cuthburh separated, and Cuthburh established an abbey at Wimborne Minster where she was abbess. At least two sons were born to Aldfrith, but whether Cuthburh was their mother is unrecorded. Osred, born around 696 or 697, succeeded to the throne after a civil war following Aldfrith&#x27;s death. Little is known of Offa, who is presumed to have been killed after being taken from Lindisfarne in 750 on the orders of King Eadberht of Northumbria. Osric, who was later king, may have been Aldfrith&#x27;s son, or alternatively the son of Aldfrith&#x27;s half-brother Alhfrith. The 13th-century discovery of a tomb thought to be that of St Osana has led to the suggestion that Osana was the daughter of Aldfrith, although this view is not widely held by modern historians.

Aldfrith was said to have been ill for some time before his death, dying on 14 December 704 or 705. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; adds that he died at Driffield in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The succession was disputed by Eadwulf, supported initially by Bishop Wilfrid, and supporters of Aldfrith&#x27;s young son Osred, apparently led by Berht&#x27;s kinsman Berhtfrith.

The reports of Aldfrith&#x27;s death in the Irish annals call him Aldfrith son of Oswiu, but some of these are glossed by later scribes with the name Flann Fína mac Ossu. A collection of wisdom literature attributed to Flann Fína, the &quot;Briathra Flainn Fhina Maic Ossu&quot;, has survived, though the text is not contemporary with Aldfrith as it is in Middle Irish, a form of Irish not in use until the 10th century.

<text>Lubang Island is the largest among the seven islands in the Lubang Group of Islands, an archipelago situated to the northwest of the northern tip of the island of Mindoro in the Philippines. It is positioned approximately 40 kilometers west of Calatagan, Batangas, or 117 kilometers southwest of Manila. The Lubang Group of Islands is under the jurisdiction of the province of Occidental Mindoro and divided into two municipalities. The principal settlement is the town of Lubang, located at the northwest section and about 11 kilometers northwest of Tilik Port. The southeastern portion of the Lubang Island falls within the municipality of Looc, which also operates a port in a different area, specifically in Barangay Agkawayan. Lubang Group of Islands stands as a distinct geographical entity isolated from any landmass, rendering it biologically unique and also endangered.

==Geography==
Northwest to southeast the four main islands are Cabra, separated by a deep, wide channel from Lubang Island, then Ambil to the northeast of Lubang and finally Golo. The three smaller islands are Talinas, Mandaui and Malavatuan.

* Cabra, which is wholly under the barangay also named Cabra in the municipality of Lubang, is mostly wooded and about long, rising to a height of about . It has a lighthouse at the northwest end of the island.
* Lubang Island is about , being over in length and up to wide. It is the 34th largest island in the Philippine archipelago.
* Ambil is an extinct volcanic island rising to over and is about in area. During the earlier part of the Spanish Colonial Era, Ambil was reported to be in eruption. But when it was climbed by German scientist Carl Semper in the latter part of 19th century, he found no evidence that it has erupted in historical times. It is the 93rd largest island in the Philippine archipelago. Together with the two smaller islands of Mandaui and Malavatuan, Ambil is administered under the barangay also named Ambil in the municipality of Looc.
* Golo Island is long, narrow and flat lying, and is about in area. It is divided into two barangays of Looc: Bulacan and Talaotao.

==History==
The islands were originally settled by a proto-ethnic group that eventually developed into the present-day Tagalog. The island people of Lubang were among the first in the Philippines to have trade contacts with Chinese traders, as the island was an entry point to what the Chinese then referred as &quot;Ma-i&quot; in their trade records.

The Spanish built a fort on Lubang Island, the San Vicente Bastion, on the western point of the entrance to Tilik Port. In the late 19th century, the United States annexed the Philippines following the Spanish-American War.

After World War II, Lubang Island was where Hiroo Onoda, a Japanese army intelligence officer, and three associates hid in the jungles when the Allies reclaimed the Philippines. They engaged in continuous, and sometimes deadly, guerrilla warfare against the United States and later against Philippine Commonwealth troops and paramilitary police. One of the others surrendered, and two were killed over the decades. Although official flyers were dropped by airplanes in his hiding area, Onoda adamantly believed that the war was not over yet. In March 1974, he was officially relieved of duty by his former commanding officer, 29 years after the end of the war, making him one of the last Japanese soldiers to surrender.

Two films, &quot;Onoda&#x27;s War&quot; (2016), shot around Vigo, Burol, Agkawayan and Looc, and &quot;&quot; (2021) are about Onoda&#x27;s time on Lubang. In addition, Werner Herzog wrote a novel about it, &quot;The Twilight World&quot;.

==Administration==
The islands are administratively part of the province of Occidental Mindoro and are divided into two municipalities: Lubang and Looc. Lubang covers the northwestern half of Lubang Island (Cabra Island included), while Looc covers the remaining half of Lubang Island plus Ambil, Golo and the other islands. Looc Proper is divided into three major sections: BonBon, Gitna and Kanluran.

==Economics==
Most of the population resides on Lubang Island, where Tilik Port is located. The main economic activity is fishing in the waters surrounding the islands and planting rice, garlic, peanut, and vegetables. However, with the islands fine white-sand coastlines, tourism is growing in economic importance.

==Biodiversity==
===Mammals===
The Lubang forest mouse (Apomys lubangensis) is a species of rodent endemic to Lubang Islands, Philippines.

The population of warty pigs (Sus spp) in the Lubang Islands might represent distinct population. Research in their Morphology and Phylogentic is required to verify their lineages.

===Reptiles=== 
The Lubang scaly-toed gecko (Lepidodactylus nakahiwalay) is a species of lizard in the Gekkonidae family endemic to Lubang Islands, Philippines.

The Lubang slender skink (Brachymeles ligtas) is a species of lizard in the Scincidae family endemic to Lubang Islands, Philippines. 

The Lubang Islands in the Philippines is also home to the Philippine Cobra (Naja philippinensis) and record of King Cobra species (Ophiophagus spp.)

They were formerly found in most habitats (from sea level to up to 2800 m) but is now confined to remote forests due to loss of habitat and heavy hunting by noose traps or trigger set bullets. The island is also home to a variety of myxomycetes or slime molds, Some of the birds that can be found in the island include the oriental dwarf kingfisher, glossy swiftlet, mangrove blue flycatcher, white-throated kingfisher, Philippine bulbul, black-naped monarch, rufous paradise flycatcher, purple-throated sunbird, and lovely sunbird, among others. The islands are also home to many insect species, some of which were recently identified. The waters of Lubang island and its outlying islands are also biodiverse. The islands converge with the Verde Island Passage.

<doc id="556220" wikidata="Q84441" url="?curid=556220" title="Odilo Globocnik">
<text>Odilo Lothar Ludwig Globocnik (21 April 1904 – 31 May 1945) was a Nazi Party official from Austria and a perpetrator of the Holocaust. A high-ranking leader of the SS, Globocnik played a leading role in Operation Reinhard, the organized murder of around one and a half million Jews, mostly of Polish origin, during the Holocaust in the Majdanek, Treblinka, Sobibór and Bełżec extermination camps. Historian Michael Allen described him as &quot;the vilest individual in the vilest organization ever known&quot;. Globocnik killed himself shortly after his capture and detention by British soldiers.

==Early life==
Odilo Lothar Ludwig Globočnik was born on 21 April 1904 in the Imperial Free City of Trieste, then the capital of the Austrian Littoral administrative region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Italy). He was the second child of Franz Globočnik, a Slovenian cavalry lieutenant in the Austro-Hungarian Army. Because Globocnik was a leading Nazi official, and perpetrator of not only the Holocaust but the ethnic cleansing of millions of Poles and other Slavs, historians have been interested in accounts of Globočnik&#x27;s Slavic ancestry – his surname is Slovenian – with his father being Slovenian while his mother was half-Serbian and half-Croatian.

His father was unable to save enough money required to get an officer&#x27;s marriage permission and had to leave the service. As was the practice at this time, he was given a job in the Imperial and Royal Mail. Odilo&#x27;s mother Anna, née Petschinka, was born in Versecz, Kingdom of Hungary (now Vršac, Serbia); she was half-Serbian and half-Croatian. In 1914, the family left Trieste for Cseklész, where Franz Globočnik was recalled to active duty after the outbreak of the First World War.

The same year, Globočnik joined the army, via a military school. The war ended his military education prematurely. He moved with his family to Klagenfurt in Carinthia. There as a teenager, he joined the pro-Austrian volunteer militia fighting Slovene volunteers and, later, the Yugoslav Army during the Carinthian War (1918–19). In 1920, he worked as an underground propagandist for the Austrian cause during the Carinthian Plebiscite.

He later enrolled at the Höhere Staatsgewerbeschule (a higher vocational school for mechanical engineering), where he passed his Matura (the Austrian equivalent of the German Abitur) and graduated with honours. He worked as a porter at the railway station, among other jobs, to help financially support his family.

Globočnik first became politically active in 1922, when he became a prominent member of pre-Nazi Carinthian paramilitary organisations and was seen wearing a swastika. At the time, he was a building tradesman, introduced to his job while engaged to Grete Michner. Her father, Emil Michner, had talked to the director of KÄWAG (&quot;Kärntner Wasserkraftwerke&quot; AG), an electricity distribution company of Carinthia, and secured Globočnik a job as a technician and construction supervisor.

===Slavic ancestry===
After he entered politics, Globočnik faced ridicule from the German and international media for his Slavic surname and ancestry, in light of the Nazis&#x27; (including Globočnik&#x27;s) extreme racism against Slavs. Globočnik would assiduously maintain that he was of &quot;Germanic ancestry&quot;. Slavs were considered sub-human (&quot;Untermenschen&quot;) in the Nazi racial taxonomy and eventually subjected to slave labour and genocide by Nazi Germany. He said that his paternal grandfather was an &quot;Aryan&quot; who was &quot;culturally Slavicized&quot;, but maintained his &quot;Germanic blood&quot;. Historians have often dismissed this as a ruse. This interpretation depended on a distinction between the &quot;Windisch&quot; and &quot;Slowenen&quot;, introduced by Martin Wutte in a 1927 book. &quot;Windisch&quot; were considered of German blood and therefore also &quot;worthy&quot; of &quot;Re-Germanization&quot;, and the Slovenes, who were Slavic and therefore, in NS parlance, to be exterminated.

In his 2004 biography of Globočnik, historian Gregor Joseph Kranjc devoted the entire first chapter to the debate concerning Globočnik&#x27;s ancestry. He says that Globočnik was ridiculed by other Nazis for his surname, because the Nazis classified Slavs as sub-human (&quot;Untermenschen&quot;). However, with Globočnik having a powerful and high-ranking ally such as Heinrich Himmler, he was protected from other Nazis, and Himmler defended him by claiming that he was of Aryan origin and that his surname was a result of &quot;Slavicization,&quot; which was consistent with Himmler&#x27;s Lebensborn programme that kidnapped tens of thousands of Slavic children for forced Germanization under the justification that such children are the result of ancient Aryans. The DNA studies conducted by the Blavatnik Institute at Harvard Medical School as part of the John Templeton Foundation Human Atlas project has ironically demonstrated in 2019 that the Slavic population were, in reality, descended from the Yamnaya population, once called Aryans, more directly than the Germanic peoples, as carriers of the Y-haplogroup R1a chromosomal variation, as is found among the Brahmin in India and the upper classes of Persia.

In 2004, historian Joseph Poprzeczny argued in his biography of Globocnik that the story might have been credible, citing Austro-Hungarian census data from 1910 indicating that the Globočniks were ethnic Germans. However, this claim is dubious as Austro-Hungarian censuses did not record ethnicity from its inhabitants but rather native languages to exaggerate how much German was spoken and subsequently downplay non-German languages and ethnicities within the Empire, which meant that the Globočniks may have just been German-speaking Slavs, especially considering they were living under Habsburg rule and their proximity to Austria. At the time of his birth, the Slovene Lands were ruled directly from Vienna and divided into parts of the duchies of Carniola and Styria and the Austrian Littoral.

==Nazi Party and SS career==

In August 1933, Globočnik was arrested for the first time, for his attempt to contact imprisoned Nazis in Klagenfurt. In the same year, he became a member of the Austrian SS. He was arrested due to his public support for the Nazi Party (NSDAP), as he had become a member of the party in 1931 while he was in Carinthia. Although he was arrested four times between 1933 and 1935, he served just over a year in jail on various political charges. Heinrich Himmler intervened on his behalf, after two years of arguments between Globočnik and the authorities.

His first documented activity for the NSDAP occurred in 1931 when he was documented as distributing propaganda for the party. By then, he had nearly abandoned his work as a building tradesman, and attached himself very closely to the NSDAP. He was assigned to develop a courier and intelligence service for the NSDAP, which channelled funds from the German Reich into Austria. In June 1933, in Vienna, Jewish jeweller was killed when a bomb was thrown at his shop. This was among the earliest murders in Austria attributable to the Nazis, and a number of historians believe that Globočnik was involved in the attack.

Globočnik joined the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) on 1 September 1934. His devotion to the Nazi cause paid off, as he was quickly promoted in the party apparatus in Austria. He became a Deputy &quot;Gauleiter&quot; briefly in Vienna and then in Carinthia between January and May 1933. He was appointed as the head of the party intelligence apparatus in Carinthia, serving from 1934 to 1936. From September 1936 to May 1938, he served as the Chief of Staff of the National Leadership of the Austrian Nazi Party under Hubert Klausner.

Globočnik was a key player in the usurpation of the Austrian government by the Nazis. With the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, Nazi Germany annexed Austria on 12 March 1938.

Globočnik was rewarded with an appointment as a State Secretary in the Nazi government, established by Chancellor Arthur Seyss-Inquart on 15 March. On 10 April 1938, he was elected to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. Next came his appointment as &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Vienna on 22 May 1938 by Adolf Hitler.

In his early tenure as &quot;Gauleiter&quot;, Globočnik espoused Nazi anti-Jewish philosophy: &quot;I will not recoil from radical interventions for the solution of Jewish questions.&quot; Later that same year he opened Vienna&#x27;s first anti-Semitic political exhibition, which was attended by 10,000 visitors on the first day. Prominent at the exhibition and received enthusiastically by the public was the film, &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;.
Early gestures of accommodation to the new government by Cardinal Innitzer did not assuage the Austrian Nazi radicals, foremost among them being Globočnik. He launched a crusade against the Church, and the Nazis confiscated property, closed Catholic organisations and sent many priests to Dachau. Anger at the treatment of the Church in Austria grew quickly, and in October 1938 the first act of overt mass resistance to the new regime took place. A rally of thousands left Mass in Vienna chanting &quot;Christ is our Führer&quot;, before being dispersed by police. A Nazi mob ransacked Cardinal Innitzer&#x27;s residence, after he denounced Nazi persecution of the Church.

Globočnik was relieved of his posts and stripped of his party honours on 30 January 1939, when it was discovered that he was involved in illegal foreign currency speculation. As punishment, Himmler transferred Globočnik to the Waffen-SS, in the rank of junior sergeant (Unterscharführer), where he served with SS Standarte &quot;Germania&quot; during the Polish campaign. Himmler liked Globočnik and recognised his value. In late 1939, Globočnik was pardoned, promoted to SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot;, and assigned to Lublin province.

===Crimes in occupied Poland===
On 9 November 1939, Himmler appointed Globočnik as SS and Police Leader in the Lublin district of the General Government territory. After the initially disappointing party career, Globočnik now had a second chance in the ranks of the SS and the police. On 16 February 1940, Globočnik declared: &quot;The evacuated Jews should feed themselves and be supported by their countrymen, as these Jews have enough [food]. If this does not succeed, one should let them starve.&quot;

In the following years, Globočnik was responsible for:
#&#x27;Liquidating&#x27; the Warsaw Ghetto, which contained about 500,000 Jews, the largest Jewish community in Europe and the second-largest in the world after New York City.
#Liquidating the Białystok Ghetto, which had strongly resisted German occupation.
#Resettling a large number of Poles under the premise of &#x27;ethnic cleansing&#x27;.
#Implementation and supervision of the Lublin reservation, to which 95,000 Jews were deported, with its adjacent network of forced labour camps in the Lublin district. He was also in charge of over 45,000 Jewish labourers.
Globocnik is reported to have taken great joy in killings and organizing killings of Jews, stating that, in Höss&#x27; rendition, Globocnik &quot;wanted to be in the forefront with his exterminations&quot; even when transportation capacities did not allow for it and then he &quot;carried out executions at his own discretion&quot;

===Extermination camps===
There are indications that Globočnik, along with a chief accomplice Christian Wirth, may have originated the concept of the extermination camp and industrialised murder, and suggested the concept to Himmler. At a two-hour meeting with Himmler on 13 October 1941, Globočnik received verbal approval to begin construction of the Belzec extermination camp, the first such camp in the General Government. Shortly beforehand, in September 1941, Globočnik had been visited by Philipp Bouhler and Viktor Brack, the top officials in the Fuhrer Chancellery responsible for the &quot;Aktion T4&quot; &quot;euthanasia&quot; program, which had been using gas chambers disguised as shower rooms to execute many of its victims. On or about 1 October 1941, Globočnik wrote a memorandum to Himmler containing proposals for actions against the Jews &quot;of a security policy nature,&quot; and the 13 October meeting was held to discuss this memorandum and related subjects.

A colleague&#x27;s contemporaneous letter reflects Globočnik&#x27;s state of mind at the time of the 13 October meeting: Globočnik said it was necessary to undertake a &quot;cleansing of the entire [General Government] of Jews and Poles&quot; and was &quot;full of good and far-reaching plans&quot; to achieve this objective. There are indications that Globočnik may have begun a crude experimental gassing facility in the woods near Belzec shortly before his mid-October meeting with Himmler. At the 13 October 1941 meeting with Himmler, Globočnik proposed exterminating the Jews in assembly-line fashion in a concentration camp, using gas chambers. On 14 October 1941 – the day after he had met with Globočnik – Himmler held a five-hour meeting with Reinhard Heydrich to discuss &quot;executions&quot;, following which other extermination camp gassing sites were built. Days later, Himmler forbade all further Jewish emigration from Reich territory &quot;in view of the forthcoming &#x27;Final Solution&#x27; to the Jewish question.&quot;
The gassing facilities that Globočnik established at Belzec soon after his 13 October meeting with Himmler were designed by T4 programme personnel assigned to him. They used carbon monoxide, as the T4 programme had done. Before it became an extermination camp, Belzec had been part of Himmler&#x27;s and Globočnik&#x27;s Burggraben project. The construction of three more death camps, Sobibor and Majdanek in the Lublin district and Treblinka at Małkinia Górna, followed in 1942. Globočnik was complicit in the extermination of more than 1.5 million Jews of Polish, Czech, Dutch, French, Russian, Slovak, German, Portuguese, Turkish, Spanish and Austrian origin, as well as a smaller number of non-Jews, in the death camps under his control.

He exploited Jews and non-Jews as slave labourers in his own forced labour camps. He was responsible for seizing the properties and valuables of murdered inmates while in charge of Operation Reinhard. Although other arms of the Nazi state were also involved in the overall management of the greater concentration camp system, Globočnik had control over the &quot;Aktion Reinhard&quot; camps, and any orders that he received came directly from Himmler. From 1942 to 1943, he also oversaw the beginning of the Generalplan Ost, the plan to expel Poles from their lands and resettle those territories with German settlers (see Zamość Uprising). On 9 November 1942, Globočnik was promoted to &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; and &quot;Generalleutnant der Polizei&quot;.

===Activities in Italy===
After the Armistice of Cassibile, Globočnik was appointed as Higher SS and Police Leader of the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral of Italy on 13 September 1943.

After the completion of Operation Reinhard in Poland, he was sent to Trieste, his hometown. 
Having looted assets stolen from Holocaust victims at death camps in occupied Poland, Globočnik went to Italy with a number of his men who had taken part in &quot;Aktion Tiergarten 4&quot; including Franz Stangl from Treblinka and Franz Reichleitner from Sobibor. A few days after 8 September 1943 (when the Armistice between Italy and the Allies signed on 3 September had come into force), Christian Wirth arrived in Trieste. Together, they converted an old rice mill on the outskirts of the city into a detention centre complete with a crematorium, known as Risiera di San Sabba (in Slovene: &quot;Rižarna&quot;). At San Sabba, thousands of Italian Jews, partisans and other political dissidents were interrogated, tortured and murdered under the direction of these men after the 1943 downfall of Benito Mussolini and the German takeover of the country.

In Slovene Littoral, Slovene Partisans were fought both by Germans and by the Littoral Home Guard, which was also under Globočnik&#x27;s direct command. It provided Germans with lists of locations of Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation hideouts and suspicious individuals (described as &quot;propagandists&quot;).

With the advance of Allied troops, Globočnik retreated into Austrian Carinthia and finally went into hiding high in the mountains near Weissensee, still in the company of his closest staff members.

==Death==
Globočnik was tracked down and captured by a British armoured cavalry unit on 31 May 1945 in Carinthia, Austria. A unit from the 4th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars, found him on the Möslacher Alm, a mountain in the Eastern Alps, with seven other wanted Nazis: Georg Michalsen, Friedrich Rainer, Ernst Lerch, Hermann Höfle, Karl Hellesberger, Hugo Herzog and Friedrich Plöb. Globočnik was taken to Paternion in Villach-Land District to be interrogated. However, before he was questioned, Globočnik committed suicide by biting on a cyanide capsule.

His body was taken to be buried in a local churchyard, but the priest reportedly refused to have &quot;the body of such a man&quot; resting in consecrated ground. A grave was dug outside the churchyard, next to an outer wall, and the body was buried without ceremony.

Contemporary photographs of Globočnik&#x27;s corpse and reliable reports, such as the &quot;Regimental Diary and Field Reports&quot; of the 4th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars, detailed the circumstances of his capture and suicide. Some speculated that his death came at the hands of either partisans or a Jewish revenge squad, or that he was turned over alive to US intelligence by the British. The latter claim is based on an &quot;official US document signed by US CIC S/A Operations Officer Andrew L. Venters, dated 27 October 1948, &quot;more than three years after his supposed death&quot;&quot;. However, this document was exposed as a forgery in the 1980s by the investigative writer and historian, Gitta Sereny; she gives all details in a long article in &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper.

==Portrayal in media==
Globočnik is a key antagonist in the Robert Harris alternative-history novel &quot;Fatherland&quot;; in the book set in 1964, a character based on Globocnik is still alive and a top SS official. In the 1994 television film adaptation, Globočnik was played by John Shrapnel.

In the Harry Turtledove alternate-history novel &quot;In the Presence of Mine Enemies&quot;, set in 2010, a former Reichskommissar for Ostland Affairs called Odilo Globočnik (likely an analogue rather than the historical figure) is briefly installed as Führer in an SS-backed &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against the reformist Heinz Buckliger; after the coup fails due to popular opposition, Globočnik is lynched.

<doc id="556222" wikidata="Q231253" url="?curid=556222" title="Symphony No. 4 (Shostakovich)">
<text>Dmitri Shostakovich composed his Symphony No. 4 in C minor, Op. 43, between September 1935 and May 1936, after abandoning some preliminary sketch material. In January 1936, halfway through this period, &quot;Pravda&quot;—under direct orders from Joseph Stalin—published an editorial &quot;Muddle Instead of Music&quot; that denounced the composer and targeted his opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk&quot;. Despite this attack and the political climate of the time, Shostakovich completed the symphony and planned its premiere for December 1936 in Leningrad. After rehearsals began, the orchestra&#x27;s management cancelled the performance, offering a statement that Shostakovich had withdrawn the work. He may have agreed to withdraw it to relieve orchestra officials of responsibility. The symphony was premiered on 30 December 1961 by the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra led by Kirill Kondrashin.

==Instrumentation==

Shostakovich uses a large orchestra requiring over one hundred musicians. It is scored for the following instruments:

:16–20 1st Violins
:14–18 2nd Violins
:12–16 Violas
:12–16 cellos
:10–14 Double basses

;Keyboard
:Celesta

;Brass:
:8 Horns
:4 Trumpets
:3 Trombones
:2 Tubas

;Percussion:
:6 Timpani (two players)
:Bass drum
:Snare drum
:Cymbals (crash and suspended, 2 players, one for each)
:Triangle
:Wood block
:Castanets
:Tam-tam
:Xylophone
:Glockenspiel
==Structure==

The symphony has three movements:

Most performances of the symphony last a little over an hour.

==Historical overview==

===Composition===
Shostakovich began the Fourth Symphony in September 1935. His second and third symphonies, completed in 1927 and 1929, had been patriotic works with choral finales, but the new score was different. Toward the end of 1935 he told an interviewer, &quot;I am not afraid of difficulties. It is perhaps easier, and certainly safer, to follow a beaten path, but it is also dull, uninteresting and futile.&quot;

Shostakovich abandoned sketches for the symphony some months earlier and began anew. On 28 January 1936, when he was about halfway through work on the symphony, &quot;Pravda&quot; printed an unsigned editorial entitled &quot;Muddle Instead of Music&quot;, which singled out his internationally successful opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk&quot; for condemnation. The fact that the editorial was unsigned indicated that it represented the official Party position. Rumors circulated for a long time that Stalin had directly ordered this attack after he attended a performance of the opera and stormed out after the first act.

&quot;Pravda&quot; published two more articles in the same vein in the next two and a half weeks. On 3 February, &quot;Ballet Falsehood&quot; assailed his ballet &quot;The Limpid Stream&quot;, and &quot;Clear and Simple Language in Art&quot; appeared on 13 February. Although this last article was technically an editorial attacking Shostakovich for &quot;formalism&quot;, it appeared in the &quot;Press Review&quot; section. Stalin, under cover of the Central Committee, may have singled out Shostakovich because the plot and music of &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; infuriated him, the opera contradicted Stalin&#x27;s intended social and cultural direction for the nation at that period, or he resented the recognition Shostakovich was receiving both in the Soviet Union and in the West.

Despite these criticisms, Shostakovich continued work on the symphony—though he simultaneously refused to allow a concert performance of the last act of &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot;. He explained to a friend, &quot;The audience, of course, will applaud—it&#x27;s considered &quot;bon ton&quot; to be in the opposition, and then there&#x27;ll be another article with a headline like &#x27;Incorrigible Formalist.&#x27;&quot;

Once he completed the score, Shostakovich was apparently uncertain how to proceed. His new symphony did not emulate the style of Nikolai Myaskovsky&#x27;s socialist realist Sixteenth Symphony, &quot;The Aviators&quot;, or Vissarion Shebalin&#x27;s song-symphony &quot;The Heroes of Perekop&quot;. Showing the new symphony to friends did not help. One asked what Shostakovich thought the reaction from &quot;Pravda&quot; would be. Shostakovich replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t write for &quot;Pravda&quot;, but for myself.&quot;

Despite the increasingly repressive political atmosphere, Shostakovich continued to plan for the symphony&#x27;s premiere, scheduled by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra for 11 December 1936 under the orchestra&#x27;s music director, Fritz Stiedry. The composer also played the score on piano for Otto Klemperer, who responded enthusiastically and planned to conduct the symphony&#x27;s first performance outside the USSR in Latin America.

===Withdrawal===
After a number of rehearsals that made the musicians increasingly unenthusiastic, Shostakovich met with several officials of the Composers Union and the Communist Party, along with I.M. Renzin, the Philharmonic&#x27;s director, in the latter&#x27;s office. He was informed that the 11 December performance was being cancelled and that he was expected to make the announcement and provide an explanation. The composer&#x27;s direct participation is unknown, but the newspaper &quot;Soviet Art&quot; (&quot;Sovetskoe iskusstvo&quot;) published a notice that Shostakovich had asked for the symphony&#x27;s premiere to be cancelled &quot;on the grounds that it in no way corresponds to his current creative convictions and represents for him a long-outdated creative phase&quot;, that it suffered from &quot;grandiosomania&quot; and he planned to revise it.

Decades later, Isaak Glikman, who was Shostakovich&#x27;s personal secretary in the 1930s and a close friend, provided a different account. He wrote that party officials exerted pressure on Renzin to cancel the scheduled performance, and Renzin, reluctant to take responsibility for the programming decision himself, instead privately persuaded Shostakovich to withdraw the symphony.

===Premiere===

The manuscript score for the Fourth Symphony was lost during World War II. Using the orchestral parts that survived from the 1936 rehearsals, Shostakovich had a two-piano version published in an edition of 300 copies in Moscow in 1946. Shostakovich began considering a performance only after Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 changed the cultural climate in the Soviet Union. He undertook no revisions. Conductor Kirill Kondrashin led the premiere of the orchestral version on 30 December 1961 with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra. The first performance outside the USSR took place at the 1962 Edinburgh Festival with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Gennady Rozhdestvensky on 7 September 1962.

Soviet critics were excited at the prospect of finding a major missing link in Shostakovich&#x27;s creative output, yet refrained from value-laden comparisons. They generally placed the Fourth Symphony firmly in its chronological context and explored its significance as a way-station on the road to the more conventional Fifth Symphony. Western critics were more overtly judgmental, especially since the Fourth was premiered just three days after the Twelfth Symphony in Edinburgh. The critical success of the Fourth juxtaposed with the critical disdain for the Twelfth led to speculation that Shostakovich&#x27;s creative powers were on the wane.

==Influence of Mahler==
The symphony is strongly influenced by Gustav Mahler, whose music Shostakovich had been closely studying with Ivan Sollertinsky during the preceding ten years. (Friends remembered seeing Mahler&#x27;s Seventh Symphony on Shostakovich&#x27;s piano at that time.) The duration, the size of the orchestra, the style and range of orchestration, and the recurrent use of &quot;banal&quot; melodic material juxtaposed with more high-minded, even &quot;intellectual&quot; material, all come from Mahler.

<text>The ArsDigita Community System (ACS) was an open source toolkit for developing community web applications developed primarily by developers associated with ArsDigita Corporation. It was licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL, and is one of the most famous products to be based completely on AOLserver. Although there were several forks of the project, the only one that is still actively maintained is OpenACS.

Features of ACS included a core set of APIs, datamodels, and database routines for coordinating information common to all community web applications, as well as modules such as workflow management, CMS, messaging, bug/issue tracking, project tracking, e-commerce, and bboards.

==History==
ACS was built in the mid-1990s to support the photo.net online community as well as a variety of Internet services from Hearst Corporation.

Its creator, ArsDigita, was founded in 1997 by developers such as Philip Greenspun. The initial developers included Tracy Adams, Ben Adida, Eve Andersson, Jin S. Choi, Philip Greenspun, Aurelius Prochazka, and Brian Tivol.

The ACS was originally written using the Oracle database and AOLserver threaded web server and thus was a combination of SQL, HTML templates, and Tcl code to merge database results with templates. ACS 3.4, however, was also available with Java Server Pages to run with Apache and Tomcat. In 2001, the code tree was forked, with the Tcl code base being maintained and refactored by one group of developers, while the product line was being re-written in Java EE.

In 2002, Red Hat acquired ArsDigita and all of its assets. As a result of this, the Java version was renamed &quot;Red Hat CCM&quot;, and official support for the Tcl version ceased. However, the Tcl version continued to be maintained by the OpenACS community.

===OpenACS===
The Open Architecture Community System provides:

* A set of applications, that can be used to deploy web sites that are strong on collaboration. Some of the applications are Workflow, CMS, Messaging, Bug/Issue tracker, e-commerce, blogger, chat and forums.
* An application development toolkit, that provides an extensive set of APIs and services to enable quick development of new applications. Features include permissioning, full internationalization, Ajax, form builder, object model, automated testing, subsites and a powerful package manager.

OpenACS runs on AOLserver and NaviServer with either Oracle or PostgreSQL as its database.

Projects that were or are based on OpenACS include dotLrn, dotFolio, dotCommunity, dotConsult, Project-Open, and Voice Online Communities.

<doc id="556231" wikidata="Q1477719" url="?curid=556231" title="Almas (folklore)">
<text>In North Caucasian and Turkic folklore, an almas, alma or almasty, is a cryptid folk creature said to inhabit the Caucasus, Tian Shan and Pamir Mountains of Central Asia and the Altai Mountains of western Mongolia.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;almas&quot; and numerous variants thereof appear in Mongolian, Turkic languages and Iranian languages.

P. R. Rinčen, a scholar, in 1964 stated in his writings that &quot;the origin of the old name is quite unknown … and it does not lend itself for translation in other languages&quot;.

The name is connected to a variety of place names (toponyms) in southwestern Mongolia, including Almasyn Dobo (&#x27;the Hills of Almases&#x27;), Almasyn Ulan Oula (&#x27;the Red Mountains of Almases&#x27;) and (&#x27;the Red Rocks of Almases&#x27;).

Folk belief in the almas in Ovorkhangai and Bayankhongor has resulted in a name-avoidance taboo there, wherein the entities may be referred to as &quot;akhai&quot;, meaning &#x27;uncle-brother&#x27;.

The folk traditions of Darkhad include the Almas khara Tenguer, meaning &#x27;Almas the Black God&#x27; and associated with highland prairies and mountain forests. According to Rinčen, the god may be offered edible wild roots and wild animal meat.

==Description==
Nikolay Przhevalsky describes the almas, as related to him under the name &quot;kung-guressu&quot; (&quot;man-beast&quot;), as follows:&quot;We were told that it had a flat face like that of a human being, and that it often walked on two legs, that its body was covered with a thick black fur, and its feet armed with enormous claws; that its strength was terrible, and that not only were hunters afraid of attacking it, but that the inhabitants removed their habitations from those parts of the country which it visited&quot;.Heaney suggests that the almas should be identified with the Arimaspi, a group of legendary humanoid creatures said to inhabit the Riphean Mountains.

== In science ==
In 1964, a Soviet scientist from the Soviet Academy of Sciences proposed that the Almasti could be a relict population of Neanderthals still living in Siberia.

In 1992, a group of scientists went on an expedition to search for the almas in the Caucasus Mountains.

A 2014 study concluded that hair samples attributed to the almas were from species which includes &quot;Ursus arctos&quot;, &quot;Equus caballus&quot; &quot;and Bos taurus&quot;. Gutiérrez and Pine concluded that several of these samples were from the brown bear.

<doc id="556237" wikidata="Q170453" url="?curid=556237" title="Amazonas (Venezuelan state)">
<text>Amazonas State (, ) is one of the 23 states into which Venezuela is divided. It covers nearly a fifth of the area of Venezuela, but has less than 1% of Venezuela&#x27;s population.

The state capital is Puerto Ayacucho. The capital until the early 1900s was San Fernando de Atabapo. Although named after the Amazon River, most of the state is drained by the Orinoco River. Amazonas State covers 176,899 km2 and, in 2007, had a population of 142,200. Its density is 0.8 inhabitants per km2.

Amazonas has Venezuela&#x27;s highest proportion of indigenous peoples of Venezuela; these make up only around 1.5% of the population nationwide, but the proportion is nearly 50% in Amazonas.

==Etymology==
&quot;Amazonas&quot; is from &quot;Amazons&quot;, a word of Greek origin that was identified with a race of female warriors who lived in the Asian Sarmacia, beyond the Caucasus.

The name was assigned to the state on June 2, 1856, in honor of the Amazon River, which was discovered by Francisco de Orellana in 1542. He also attributed the name to the river as a result of a legend about a female tribe that tenaciously resisted the Spanish conquerors that reminded him of the Greek legend.

The Amazon River does not pass through the State, but a part of the territory is covered by the Amazon, through the Río Negro (Black River).

==History==

The territory of the state of Amazonas belonged to the province of Guyana since the time of the Spanish colonization. Some chronicles indicate that the expedition of the Father Acuna was crossing the black river and this way would have discovered the Casiquiare in 1639. In 1682 the Friar Ignacio Fiol establishes the locality of Atures.

Until 1817, the region was made up of the cantons of San Fernando de Atabapo, La Esmeralda and San Carlos de Río Negro and Maroa, in correspondence with first stable population centres founded by the metropolis. Until 1842 it was known as the canton of Río Negro, depending successively on the province of Guayana, department of Orinoco, confederation of the Great Colombia and the State Sovereign of Venezuela.
Between 1856 and 1861 it was known as the province of Amazonas of the Republic of Venezuela, this being the first time that its association with the great Amazon region.

The state dates back to the creation of the district of Río Negro, on August 20, 1841, which included the south of the province of Guayana. In 1856 it became the province of Amazonas, declared a federal entity on March 28, 1864, comprising the departments of San Fernando de Atabapo, Maroa and San Carlos.

In 1864 the Federal Territory Amazonas was created, with the capital San Fernando de Atabapo. 
From 1876 to 1880, the entity maintained the denomination of Amazon territory, but its capital was transferred to Yavita, as a response to the political instability that dominated the region, where a series of warlords associated with the exploitation of the wild rubber were disregarded by national authorities. Then, under the mandate of President Antonio Guzmán Blanco in 1881, it was decided to divide the area into two territories: the Federal Territory Amazonas and the Federal Territory Alto Orinoco. 12 years later it was decided to reunify the territories with the name of Amazonas in 1893 and with its capital in San Fernando de Atabapo.

Between 1880 and 1893, the region was separated in the territories of Alto Orinoco and Amazonas, with capitals in San Fernando of Atabapo and Maroa in the United States of Venezuela.

In 1928 the then president Juan Vicente Gómez decided to move the state capital to the north specifically to the city of Puerto Ayacucho to facilitate connections with Caracas and the rest of the nation.

It continued as Federal Territory Amazonas because it did not meet the minimum population to change its category to State of the Federation according to the old National Constitution. In 1992 its status was changed to State, with the same capital and territory.

==Geography==
The State of Amazonas belongs to the region of Guayana and is the second largest in territorial area after the State of Bolivar, although it is mostly sparsely populated, except in the northern part where most of its population is concentrated.
===Relief ===

The entire state of Amazonas is included in the so-called Guiana Shield. Its relief is included from the margins of the Orinoco to the Marahuaca peak with 2832 m. The highest peak in the state is the Tapirapecó at 2992 meters above sea level, in the Serranía La Neblina National Park on the border with Brazil. The relief of the state is very varied, starting with the plains or savannahs, which range from 100 m to 500 m to continue with the mountains and hills, which abound in the area, except given the western side of the state that for being limited by the rivers Orinoco, Guainía and Negro, obviously run the lowest part of the territory. Indeed, to the north, east and south there are numerous mountain ranges, including Maigualida, Marahuaca, Unturán, Parima, Tapirapecó, La Neblina, Imeri and Aracamuní, among others.

In this state the main river of Venezuela, the Orinoco, is born in the Delgado Chalbaud hill and after crossing 2140 km it deposits its waters in the Atlantic Ocean. The Orinoco is, in turn, the basin where other important rivers of the region flow, such as the 474 km long Ventuari.
===Climate===
The climate of the Amazon State corresponds to the rainy, monsoon and tropical savannah types. Basically there are two seasons, one dry and one rainy. To the south there are no dry months, while to the northwest there are up to four months of drought. In the central and northern areas there is a moderate water deficiency between December and March. Average rainfall exceeds 1,200 mm per year. The annual thermal oscillation is minimal (between 1 °C and 1.5 °C) but the daily one is large, (more than 15 °C). The temperature of the coldest month is over 15 °C. The average annual temperature of the Parima station, at an altitude of 810 m, is 22.3 °C while that of Tamatama (at 112 m and the same latitude) is 27 °C.

===Vegetation===

A large part of the state of Amazonas is covered by immense forests, so the vegetation due to the high rate of rainfall is typical of the jungle. There are also dry soil savannas and wet soil savannas. Higher up and depending on the height, the vegetation becomes scarcer, until it reaches more than 2,000 where it almost disappears completely.

===Fauna===
The rich fauna of the region is represented by numerous specimens of mammals, reptiles, fish and birds:8

*Mammals: puma, jaguar, tapir, monkey (araguato, marmoset), palm tree bear or anteater (in danger of extinction), fox, etc.
*Reptiles: Orinoco caiman (in danger of extinction), baba, turtle, morrocoy, snakes, anaconda, boa constrictor, rattle, cuaima, mapanare, etc.
*Fish: toad or (Semaprochilodus laticeps), trembler or electric eel, ray, caribbean, piranha, catfish, guabina, etc.
*Birds: eagle, harpy eagle (in danger of extinction), sparrowhawk, macaw (in bright colours: red, green, yellow, orange and blue), catana, woodpecker, curassow, toucan, etc.

==Politics and government==
The State of Amazonas is only entitled to a representation of 3 deputies in the Venezuelan National Assembly, which is the minimum indicated by the 1999 Constitution since it has very little population despite its large territorial extension. Additionally, it elects a deputy along with other states representing the indigenous peoples for the southern region.

The regional movements have considerable strength to the point that in the 2005 parliamentary elections the regional party United Movement of Indigenous Peoples (MUPI) obtained 48% of the votes compared to 44% of the votes of the ruling coalition led by the Movement V Republic (MVR), Homeland for All (PPT), and the regional party United Multiethnic Peoples of the Amazon (PUAMA) considered until then the first regional force. One deputy was elected by MUPI, one by PUAMA and one by the PPT (together with the MVR-UVE).

The state is autonomous and equal politically, it organizes its administration and public powers through the Constitution of the State of Amazonas, which was adopted in 2002. The Constitution can be subject to reform or amendment, they are proposed by the Legislative Power, and to be approved, they need the favorable votes of at least 60% of the State Legislative Council, and by 10% or more of the electoral population of Amazonas.

Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

== Municipalities and municipal seats ==

== Demographics ==

=== Race and ethnicity ===

According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:

==Economy==
Its economic activity is limited, most agricultural products are consumed locally and in certain areas the State is in deficit, livestock and agriculture is extensive, these activities along with trade are the main sources of employment in the region. The use of the extensive river network allows commercial development. Ecological tourism is in full development in spite of the potential represented by its natural landscapes, it also lacks adequate tourist infrastructure for a high number of visitors. There are cultural features of valuable specificity and other unique elements.

It is one of the richest Venezuelan states in terms of natural resources, most of which are currently unexploited. There are problems of deforestation in the border areas with Brazil.

==Transport==
Being a primarily jungle region, the state of Amazonas has mostly precarious land routes, of which only 33.63% are paved. The main communication routes are air and waterways, although in the case of waterways, their navigation will depend on the rainy and dry seasons that characterize this region, since in many cases river traffic will be problematic in times of drought.

There is only one domestic airport in the state. The others are for private or military use. There are also landing strips in Cacurí, la Esmeralda, Ocamo, Kamariapó, San Juan de Manapiare, Santa Bárbara, Yaví, Yutajé and San Carlos de Río Negro.

==Culture==
The indigenous population represents about 45% of the state&#x27;s population. The ethnological culture of the state of Amazonas is the largest in the country, possessing 20 different ethnicities, differentiated by their own languages and customs. In Amazonas, indigenous languages of the Arawaka, Caribbean, Yanomami families are spoken or represent isolated languages without any known relationship to others.

The Yanomami represent 26% of the indigenous population of the state. They are located in the Upper Orinoco and extend into Guyana and Brazil. Their settlements are located around &quot;Shaponos&quot;, which can be the river or the mountain where the conuco is found to ensure their food. Among their most interesting customs is that of incinerating their dead, and then with the ashes, making a drink that, according to their customs, would bring them all the vitality of the deceased. They are small in stature; adult women do not exceed 1.50 m, and walk completely naked except for a small loincloth. Among the most common facial ornaments is that of a stick that pierces the nasal septum of women, and the haircut characteristic of the ethnicity. While indigenous ethnicities, mostly are in extinction, the Yanomamis remain the largest indigenous people of the Amazon.

The Maquiritares or Yekuanas, of the Caribbean family, live in the East and Northeast of the state. The Piaroa represent 22% of the indigenous population. The Guahibos make up 21% of the state&#x27;s indigenous population.

===Handicrafts===
Basketwork or hard fabrics: they are made in different shapes, sizes and colours. Its manufacture is based on leaves from different types of palms: moriche, cumare, seje, cucurito, chiquichique, etc. All decoration has its meaning, related to the life of the users, its sacredness, its mythology.

Soft fabrics: hammocks, hammocks, bags, baby carriers, dresses, guaiacs and their looms; pottery or ceramics; wood carvings; body decorations; hunting and fishing instruments; musical instruments; etc.

Pottery: Archaeological sites of this artistic manifestation dating from pre-Hispanic times have been found in the regions of Manapiare (Corobal), Atabapo (Nericagua), on islands in the Orinoco River, in the Lower Orinoco (Barrancas and Saladero), in Culebra, very close to Puerto Ayacucho and in other places.

The musical instruments: they are another indigenous artisan expression of the Amazon State of which there are more than 100 types.

The corporal adornments: Among these are the pintaderas, made in a circular or rectangular piece of wood carved with different designs according to their use and function.

Wooden carvings: benches (made in the shape of animals), domestic utensils, ritual objects, bongos and curiaras, canaletes, pylons, etc.

===Folklore===
Among the extensive and varied folklore of the state are samples of 62 ethnic groups, among which are: Yanomami, Puahito, Piaroa, Uekuana, Yeral Curripaco, Bare, Baniva, Puinave, Piapoco, Hoti, Warequena, Yaborana. The folkloric manifestations are rich in native dances and songs, with music played with typical wind and percussion instruments.

Among the indigenous dances is the traditional Yekuana dance. As for musical instruments, there is the use of the morrocoy shell and bamboo flutes.

The different ethnic groups have the custom of holding a Warime14 festival every three years; this festival is held to celebrate both a great harvest and new marriages within the community.

Also, on the occasion of the arrival of the rains during the months of May, June and July, indigenous dances are performed in Puerto Ayacucho and San Fernando de Atabapo.

===Gastronomy===
In Puerto Ayacucho and in the interior of the state there are restaurants where the best dishes of the area are served: turtle prepared in its carapace, tapir, lapa; also fish of the finest qualities, such as morocoto, curbina, palometa, bocón, caribe, guabina, pavón and lau lau; among the birds: paují, wild duck, turkey and chicken.

Different types of bread are also made: if the manioc from the yucca is not enough, one can try the roasted or fried green banana. The mañoco is made with bitter yucca, in whose processing certain native implements are used such as sebucan, ray and budare.

In Amazonas, fruits such as pijiguao, tupiro, cocura, moriche, copoazú, curuba, manaca, pineapples and ceje are grown; the latter is harvested throughout the state, especially in the valleys of the Manapire, Casiquiare, Sipapo, Cuao and Ventuari rivers; from it, ceje oil is extracted, which has medicinal properties.

==Sports==

Tucanes de Amazonas Fútbol Club was a soccer team belonging to the Second Division of Venezuela. It was founded in 2008, and played its home games at the Antonio José de Sucre Stadium in Puerto Ayacucho, Venezuela.

In 2018, Tucanes FC disappears for good due to disagreements in its board of directors and a new third division currency called &quot;Amazonas Futbol Club&quot; is created, which is sponsored by the regional government and takes over the Antonio José de Sucre Stadium in the city of Puerto Ayacucho.

<doc id="556240" wikidata="Q7011682" url="?curid=556240" title="New South Wales C38 class locomotive">
<text>The New South Wales C38 class, occasionally known as the 38 class and nicknamed &quot;Pacifics&quot; by some railwaymen, was a class of 4-6-2 passenger steam locomotives built by Eveleigh Railway Workshops, Clyde Engineering and Cardiff Locomotive Workshops, for the New South Wales Government Railways in Australia.

Constructed between January 1943 and November 1949, the 30 locomotives in the class were designed to haul express passenger services throughout New South Wales. They were the only New South Wales locomotives to use the popular Pacific 4-6-2 wheel arrangement and were the last steam locomotives in the state to be built for passenger train operation, all subsequent deliveries being specifically for freight haulage. The C38 class were originally in a grey and black &quot;Grey Nurse&quot; livery, but was repainted bottle green.

==Design==

The 38 class were first conceived in the 1930s when the NSWGR established there was a need for a locomotive to eliminate the complications of double heading on a number of fast intrastate passenger trains.

The design was influenced by the fashion for streamlining at the time, including elements of the class J locomotives of the Norfolk and Western Railway and of some of the streamlined versions of the PRR K4 locomotives in the United States. The design team was headed by Harold Young, the Principal Design Engineer (later Chief Mechanical Engineer) of the NSWGR. The conditions of trackwork with frequent sharp curvature to be traversed at high speed would require six-coupled driving wheels in a &#x27;Pacific&#x27; 4-6-2 configuration. Maintenance requirements suggested a two-cylinder simple steam locomotive.

The design was carried out by the NSWGR Locomotive Section of the Design Office and incorporated the latest developments in locomotive design from Australia and overseas. The incorporation of as many Australian manufactured components as possible was a requirement at the design stage.

Similarly to the earlier D57 class (which had some input from Young), the massively proportioned locomotive incorporated a cast steel chassis. The design also sported cast Boxpok coupled wheels for better rotational balance, and a Delta trailing truck.

==History==

In May 1939, an order for five 38 class locomotives was placed with Clyde Engineering. They suffered many delays during construction, mostly due to resource shortages caused by World War II and the Great Depression. The first five locomotives, built by Clyde Engineering, had a semi-streamlined boiler casing similar to the J class of New Zealand. However with this design, the firemen could not maintain steam in the 245 psi boiler – the highest boiler pressure of any engine in Australia. In early trials on the Southern line, 3801, the class leader, was allocated two firemen. The fault was located when it was found that the shape of the blast pipe prevented steam from the cylinders from passing optimally into the petticoat pipe below the chimney, through which it was ejected to the atmosphere. In turn, this reduced the suction of hot gases through the boiler tubes, making it more demanding to fire. Soon the blast pipe was adjusted, and the C38 class became noted for the clean &quot;bark&quot; of its exhaust.

As the last of the five initial locomotives were leaving the shop in 1945, a decision was made to purchase more. This order of 25 locomotives were built at the New South Wales Government Railways&#x27; Eveleigh Railway Workshops (13, even-numbered) and Cardiff Locomotive Workshops (12, odd-numbered); all were non-streamlined for quicker maintenance.

The locomotives built by Clyde Engineering were delivered in wartime grey. After the war, all were repainted green, as the 25 unstreamlined locomotives had been from new. In the 1950s, all except 3813 were painted black. 3801 and 3830 had their green livery restored due to pressure from heritage groups in the 1960s.

Among the services they initially hauled were the &quot;Central West Express&quot;, &quot;Newcastle Flyer&quot;, &quot;Melbourne Limited Express&quot;, &quot;Riverina Express&quot; and &quot;South Coast Daylight Express&quot; as well as the overnight mail trains. Because of their axle load, they were confined to operating between Sydney and the following extremities of operation: Port Kembla (Coniston), Albury, Dubbo and Maitland, although they worked the North Coast passenger trains to Brisbane until track problems surfaced.

Following the arrival of the 42, 43 and 44 class diesel locomotives in the 1950s, these began to take over some express services, but the 38 class continued to haul many passenger and freight trains. Even after the electrification of the Main Western line to Lithgow in 1957 and the Main North line to Gosford in January 1960, using 46 class electric locomotives, the 38s still operated the &quot;Central West Express&quot; between Lithgow and Orange into the 1960s and the &quot;Newcastle Flyer&quot; between Gosford and Newcastle until December 1970.

The 38 class briefly returned to the former &quot;Melbourne Limited Express&quot; route in April 1962, when 3830 and 3813 hauled the inaugural standard gauge &quot;Spirit of Progress&quot; from Albury to Sydney. The first 38 class locomotive was withdrawn in 1961 with the last withdrawn in December 1970.

In August 1970, 3801 hauled the &quot;Western Endeavour&quot; to Perth following the conversion to standard gauge of the Sydney–Perth rail corridor with 3813 assisting as far as Port Pirie. In April 1988, 3801 again operated to Perth during the Australian Bicentenary.

Locomotive 3801 featured in an evocative 1974 short film, &quot;A Steam Train Passes&quot;, which won many awards and is generally regarded as Australia&#x27;s finest railway film.

==Preservation==
4 of the 30 38 class locomotives survive-3801, 3813, 3820 and 3830. 3813 is in pieces at Dorrigo after an overhaul in 1972 by the former NSW Rail Transport Museum was forced to be stopped by the then commissioner of the Public Transport Commission, Philip Shirley who ordered that the locomotive&#x27;s parts be transferred to the scrapyard. The NSWRTM managed a reprive and the parts were sent to be stored in many locations. Components such as the wheels, cab and smokebox were stored in S trucks at Thirlmere, the frame and tender at Clyde and the boiler at Castle Hill until they were donated to the Dorrigo Steam Railway &amp; Museum. Over time all were donated to the Dorrigo museum and put in storage there.

<text>Rufino del Carmen Arellanes Tamayo (August 25, 1899 – June 24, 1991) was a Mexican painter of Zapotec heritage, born in Oaxaca de Juárez, Mexico. Tamayo was active in the mid-20th century in Mexico and New York, painting figurative abstraction with surrealist influences.

==Early life==
Tamayo was born in Oaxaca, Mexico in 1899 to Manuel Arellanes and Florentina Tamayo. His mother was a seamstress and his father was a shoemaker. His mother died of tuberculosis in 1911. His Zapotec heritage is often cited as an early influence.

After his mother&#x27;s death, he moved to Mexico City to live with his aunt, where he spent a lot of time working alongside her in the city&#x27;s fruit markets.

While there, he devoted himself to helping his family with their small business. However, in 1917 Tamayo&#x27;s aunt enrolled him at Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas at San Carlos to study art. As a student, he experimented with and was influenced by Cubism, Impressionism and Fauvism, among other popular art movements of the time, but with a distinctly Mexican feel. Tamayo studied drawing at the Academy of Art at San Carlos as a young adult, he became dissatisfied and eventually decided to study on his own. That was when he began working for José Vasconcelos at the Department of Ethnographic Drawings (1921); he was later appointed head of the department by Vasconcelos.

==Career==


Rufino Tamayo, along with other muralists such as Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros, represented the twentieth century in their native country of Mexico. After the Mexican Revolution, Tamayo devoted himself to creating a distinct identity in his work. He expressed what he envisioned as traditional Mexico and eschewed the overt political art of such contemporaries as José Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros. He disagreed with these muralists in their belief that the revolution was necessary for the future of Mexico but considered, instead, that the revolution would harm Mexico.

In his painting, &quot;Niños Jugando con Fuego&quot; (&quot;Children Playing with Fire&quot;, 1947), Tamayo shows two individuals being burnt by a fire they have created, a symbol of the Mexican people being injured by their own choice and action. Tamayo claimed, &quot;We are in a dangerous situation, and the danger is that man may be absorbed and destroyed by what he has created&quot;. Due to his political opinions, he was characterized by some as a &quot;traitor&quot; to the political cause.

Tamayo came to feel that he could not freely express his art; he, therefore, decided in 1926 to leave Mexico and move to New York City. Prior to his departure, Tamayo organized a one-man show of his work in Mexico City where he was noticed for his individuality. He returned to Mexico in 1929 to have another solo show, this time being met with high praise and media coverage.

Tamayo&#x27;s legacy in the history of art lies in his &quot;oeuvre&quot; of original graphic prints in which he cultivated every technique. Tamayo&#x27;s graphic work, produced between 1925 and 1991, includes woodcuts, lithographs, etchings, and &quot;Mixografia&quot; prints. With the help of Mexican printer and engineer Luis Remba, Tamayo expanded the technical and aesthetic possibilities of the graphic arts by developing a new medium which they named Mixografia. This technique is a unique fine art printing process that allows for the production of prints with three-dimensional textures.

It not only registered the texture and volume of Rufino Tamayo&#x27;s design but also granted the artist freedom to use any combination of solid materials in its creation. Tamayo was delighted with the Mixografia process and created some 80 original Mixographs. One of their most famous Mixografia is titled &quot;Dos Personajes Atacados por Perros&quot; (&quot;Two Characters Attacked by Dogs&quot;).

In 1935, he joined the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (LEAR). The LEAR was an organization in which Mexican artists could express through painting and writing their responses towards the revolutionary war and governmental policies than are current in Mexico. Although Tamayo did not agree with Siqueiros and Orozco, they were chosen along with four others to represent their art in the first American Artists&#x27; Congress in New York. Now married, Rufino and Olga had planned on staying in New York only for the duration of the event; however, they made New York their permanent home for the next decade and a half.

In 1948, Tamayo&#x27;s first major retrospective was held at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City. Although his position remained controversial, his popularity was high. During this time, he became acquainted with young American artist Joseph Glasco who was studying at the school of art at San Miguel de Allende and Tamayo moved into Glasco’s apartment and studio at one point. Uncomfortable with the continuing political controversy, Tamayo and Olga moved to Paris in 1949 where they remained for the next decade.

Tamayo also enjoyed portraying women in his paintings. His early works included many nudes, a subject that eventually disappeared in his later career. However, he often painted his wife Taide Olga Flores Rivas Zárate showing her struggles through color choices and facial expressions. The shared difficulties of painter and wife can be seen in the portrait &quot;Rufino and Olga&quot;, circa 1934, where the couple appears broken by life&#x27;s obstacles.

Tamayo also painted murals, some of which are displayed inside Palacio Nacional de Bellas Artes opera house in Mexico City, such as &quot;Nacimiento de la nacionalidad&quot; (&quot;Birth of the Nationality&quot;, 1952).

Tamayo was known to have a couple of protégé who he privately taught. Francisco Toledo &amp; Veronica Ruiz de Velasco who were both in the National Museum of Modern Art.

==Influences==
Tamayo was influenced by many artists. María Izquierdo, a fellow Mexican artist with whom he lived with for a time, taught Tamayo precision in his color choices. He selected colors true to his Mexican environment. He argued, &quot;Mexicans are not a gay race but a tragic one ...&quot;

Other influences came from Tamayo&#x27;s cultural heritage. One can say that Tamayo was one of the few artists of his era who enjoyed Mexico&#x27;s ethnic differences. He enjoyed the fusion of Spanish-Mexican-Indian blood and that is shown in some of his art pieces. In &quot;Lion and Horse&quot; (1942), Tamayo used pre-Columbian ceramics. Tamayo was proud of his Mexican culture because his culture nourished him and, by traveling to other countries, his love for Mexico became greater.

Tamayo&#x27;s acute awareness of the disregard shown Mexican artists influenced him profoundly. For example, according to Jose Carlos Ramirez, &quot;Tamayo&#x27;s work did not have much value&quot;. Many people doubted that Mexican artists could actually create art. Under the Díaz regime, artists of Mexican origin were ignored by society; it was commonly held that they lacked the skills to surpass artists of European descent.

==Outside Mexico==
From 1937 to 1949, Tamayo and his wife Olga lived in New York where he painted some of his most memorable works. He had his first show in New York City at the Valentine Gallery. He gained credibility thereby and proceeded to exhibit works at the Knoedler Gallery and Marlborough Gallery. While in New York, Tamayo instructed Helen Frankenthaler at the Dalton School. Tamayo, while in the United States, attended important exhibitions that influenced his art mechanics. From Ingres to Picasso and French art exhibitions, Tamayo was introduced to Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism. Also, at an exhibition in Brooklyn in 1928, Tamayo came into contact with Henri Matisse, the French artist.

In a 1926 exhibition, 39 of Tamayo&#x27;s works were displayed at the Weyhe Gallery in New York just a month after his arrival into the United States. This stands in stark contrast to the few showings which were held during his early career in México. The artist&#x27;s sojourn in New York dramatically increased his recognition not only in the United States but in Mexico and other countries also.

==Style==
Tamayo explained his approach to Paul Westheim as follows: &quot;As the number of colors we use decreases, the wealth of possibilities increases&quot;. Tamayo favored using few colors rather than many; he asserted that fewer colors in a painting gave the art greater force and meaning. Tamayo&#x27;s unique color choices are evident in the painting &quot;Tres personajes cantando&quot; (Three singers), 1981. In this painting, Tamayo employs pure colors such as red and purple; his restraint in the choice of color here confirms his belief that fewer colors, far from limiting the painting, actually enlarge the composition&#x27;s possibilities. With that being said, Octavio Paz, author of the book &quot;Rufino Tamayo&quot;, argues that, &quot;Time and again we have been told that Tamayo is a great colourist; but it should be added that this richness of colour is the result of sobriety&quot;. By being pure or, as Paz explained, sober with his color choice, Tamayo&#x27;s paintings were enriched, not impoverished.

==Return home and later years==

In 1959, Tamayo and his wife, Olga Flores, returned to Mexico permanently and Tamayo built an art museum in his home town of Oaxaca, the Museo Rufino Tamayo. In 1972, Tamayo was the subject of the documentary film, &quot;Rufino Tamayo: The Sources of his Art&quot; by Gary Conklin.

The Tamayo Contemporary Art Museum (&quot;Museo Tamayo de Arte Contemporáneo&quot;), located on Mexico City&#x27;s Paseo de la Reforma boulevard where it crosses Chapultepec Park, was opened in 1981 as a repository for the collections that Rufino Tamayo and his wife acquired during their lifetimes, and ultimately donated to the nation.
Tamayo painted his last painting in 1990, at the age of 90, &quot;Luna y Sol&quot; (&quot;Moon and Sun&quot;).

Tamayo&#x27;s work has been displayed in museums throughout the world, including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, The Phillips Collection in Washington, the Cleveland Museum of Art in Cleveland, Ohio, the Naples Museum of Art in Naples, Florida, Oklahoma City Museum of Art in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and The Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, Spain.

==Death==
On June 12, 1991, Tamayo was admitted to Mexico City&#x27;s National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition for respiratory and heart failure. He suffered a heart attack and died on June 24, 1991.

Before his death, Tamayo continued creating art pieces in his late years. He was very productive at that stage in life. There were several important exhibitions and publications organized after his death.

==Theft and recovery==
Tamayo&#x27;s 1970 painting &quot;Tres Personajes&quot; was bought by a Houston man as a gift for his wife in 1977, then stolen from their storage locker in 1987 during a move. In 2003, Elizabeth Gibson found the painting in the trash on a New York City curb. Although she knew little about modern art, Gibson felt the painting &quot;had power&quot; and took it without knowing its origin or market value. She spent four years trying to learn about the work, eventually learning from the PBS website that it had been featured on an episode of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;. After seeing the Missing Masterpieces segment about &quot;Tres Personajes&quot;, Gibson and the former owner arranged to sell the painting at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction. In November, 2007 Gibson received a $15,000 reward plus a portion of the $1,049,000 auction sale price.

<doc id="556249" wikidata="Q275862" url="?curid=556249" title="Óbidos, Portugal">
<text>Óbidos (; ) is a town and a municipality in the Oeste region, historical province of Estremadura and the Leiria district. The town proper has approximately 3,100 inhabitants. The municipality population in 2011 was 11,772 covering an area of .

==History==

The name &quot;Óbidos&quot; is a Latinised (oppidum, citadel) derivation of the older Celtic &quot;Eburobricio&quot;. The municipality grew from a Roman settlement near the foothills of an elevated escarpment. The region of Óbidos, extending from the Atlantic to the interior of Estremadura Province along the rivers and lakes has been inhabited since the late Paleolithic. A settlement, constructed by early Celt tribes, was later a centre of trade for the Phoenicians. Archeological evidence from the base of the medieval tower (south of Facho) at Óbidos Castle indicates Roman construction linked to an outpost of the Roman civitas of &quot;Eburobrittium&quot;, a large urban area that has been under excavation. Archeological surveys determined the remains of a forum, baths and other Roman structures near the settlement.

After the fall of Rome, the region came under the influence of the Visigoths, although specific records are missing. The Roman town of &quot;Eburobrittium&quot; was abandoned in the 5th century for the more secure hilltop where today the principal settlement is located. Sometime after 713 the Moors established a fortification on this mountain, while a Christian community of Mozarabs lived in the &quot;Moncharro&quot; neighbourhood.

The city was taken from the Moors during the reign of the first King of Portugal, Afonso Henriques, in 1148. Tradition states that one knight, Gonçalo Mendes da Maia, was responsible for the successful storming of the Moorish castle. The retaking of Óbidos was the final stage in the conquest of the Estremadura Province region, after the settlements of Santarém, Lisbon and Torres Vedras. Following the control of the region, the settlement received its first &quot;foral&quot; (charter) in 1195, during the reign of King Sancho I. In 1210, King Afonso II gave the title of this village to Queen Urraca. Since then, Óbidos has often been patronized by the Queens of Portugal, giving rise to its informal title as &quot;Vila das Rainhas&quot; (); several royal consorts enriched the village with donations from the Middle Ages until the 16th century.

The castle and walls of Óbidos were remodelled during the reign of King Dinis I. The limestone and marble structure was strengthened and elaborated, while the keep was created in the 14th century, by King Fernando. By the time of the first remodelling project, the settlement had also grown beyond the gates of the castle.

The Church of Santa Maria in Óbidos was the setting for the wedding of King Afonso V to his cousin, Princess Isabella of Coimbra, on 15 August 1441, when they were both still children aged 9 and 10, respectively. Administrative reforms conducted by King Manuel I at Óbidos in 1513, included the institution of a formal charter and major requalification of the urban area.

The 1755 earthquake caused damage to the village walls, a few churches, and many buildings, and resulted in the loss of architecture of Arab and Medieval inspiration. Similarly, the Peninsular Wars were fought in the vicinity of Óbidos, including the Battle of Roliça. More recently, the village was a centre of government and meeting place for those involved in the 1974 Carnation Revolution, linking it to the armed forces movement revolt.

==Geography==
Located on the Atlantic Ocean coast, the municipality is bounded in the northeast and east by Caldas da Rainha, in the south by Bombarral, in the southwest by Lourinhã and the west by Peniche. Administratively, it is divided into 7 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):

* A dos Negros
* Amoreira
* Gaeiras
* Olho Marinho
* Santa Maria, São Pedro e Sobral da Lagoa
* Usseira
* Vau

==Tourism==

The area of the town of Óbidos is located on a hilltop, encircled by a fortified wall. Óbidos remains a well-preserved example of medieval architecture; its streets, squares, walls and its castle are popular tourist destinations. The castle now houses a pousada. The municipality is also home to the famous Praia D&#x27;el Rey golf complex, one of the top golf resorts in Europe, and Royal Óbidos - Spa &amp; Golf Resort.

===Óbidos Medieval Market===
Each July Óbidos castle hosts a traditional &#x27;Medieval Market&#x27;. For two weeks the castle and the surrounding town recreate the spirit of medieval Europe.

Flowing banners and heraldic flags set the mood together with hundreds of entertainers and stall holders dressed as merchants, jugglers, jesters, wandering minstrels, soldiers and more. Visitors can shop at the traditional handcrafts fair or watch medieval shows, horse displays and a costumed parade that winds its way through the streets. There are also displays of jousting knights and armed combat.

Spit roasted hog, hearty soups, rabbit, lamb, cod, quail, sausages and other grilled meats are just some of the many medieval style meals on offer from dozens of &quot;taverns&quot; and stalls spread throughout the market. Drinking from pewter tankards and eating from wooden trencher all adds to the experience.

===Literature===
Obidos is also famous for its bookstores. There are 14 bookstores, one of which is in a church, another one, the &quot;Livraria do Mercado Biológico&quot;, sells fish as well as books.

In 2013, the town administration of Óbidos developed a municipal literature programme which included the creation of an international literary festival. Since its first edition in 2015, the &quot;Fólio (Festival Literário Internacional de Óbidos)&quot; takes places every year in October.

In 2015, the UNESCO recognized Óbidos as the City of Literature.

<doc id="556250" wikidata="Q41146" url="?curid=556250" title="Apure">
<text>Apure State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. Its territory formed part of the provinces of Mérida, Maracaibo, and Barinas, in accordance with successive territorial ordinations pronounced by the colonial authorities. In 1824 the Department of Apure was created, under jurisdiction of Barinas, which laid the foundations for the current entity. In 1856 it separated from Barinas and for the first time Apure appeared as an independent province, which in 1864 acquired the status of state. In 1881, however, a new territorial division combined Apure and Guayana to form a single state named &quot;Bolívar.&quot; In 1899 it reestablished its autonomy and finally, by means of the Constitution of 1909, gained its current borders.

The territory was famous for heron plumes, which adorned European courts. At the same time, it was the scene of armed encounters that marked the evolution of the War for Independence, as well as numerous battles during the civil war. In the Apurean environs, Rómulo Gallegos was inspired to write his novel Doña Bárbara, which describes the magnitude of this land.

The state capital is San Fernando de Apure.

Based on the 2011 census information, the estimated population of Apure State in 2011 is 459,025 inhabitants.

== Toponymy ==
Apure state derives its name from the Apure River, which runs through the state. The river was known by that name in Spanish no later than the 1648 works of friar Jacinto de Carvajal. The source of the name of the river is less certain, with theories attributing it to the name of a local shrub or to a local indigenous chieftain named Apur.

== History ==
The conquest of Apure began in the mid 17th century when the land was populated by many indigenous peoples, including the Arawak and the Caribs. Actual settlement did not start until the early 18th century with large cattle foundations started by landowners looking to expand their already crowded cattle ranches in San Carlos de Austria and other cities. Some of these included Jose Ignacio Pumar (Marquee of Pumar), Joseph Blanco Y Salazar along with Franciscan missionaries from Andalucia and others missionaries and landowners that would &quot;pacify&quot; and remove the natives by the sword or converting them to Christianity.

In the colonial era, Apure was at one time part of the Province of Mérida del Espíritu Santo de la Grita, which merged with Maracaibo in 1676 to form Maracaibo Province. Its territory was part of the territory split from Maracaibo Province in 1786 to form Barinas Province. Apure Province was split from Barinas in 1823, and in 1864 it was given state status.

Apure has been an autonomous state since 1864, when the Venezuelan territory organized itself as los Estados Unidos de Venezuela, or United States of Venezuela. In 1881 it formed part of the state of Bolívar along with Guayana, but recovered the category of autonomous state in 1899.

== Geography ==
The state of Apure is located to the southwest of Venezuela, positioned between 06º03’45’’ and 08º04’22’’ latitude North and 66º21’45’’ and 72º22’30’’ longitude West. It is bordered on the north by the states of Táchira, Barinas, and Guárico, on the east and southeast by the states of Bolívar and Amazonas and on the south and west by Colombia.

=== Geology ===

Originating in the Tertiary (Neogene) and Quaternary (Pleistocene) periods, the Llanos (plains) of Apure are formed by sediments of little or no consolidation, with sandy and clayey deposits built up by floods in recent times. On the banks of the Orinoco one finds outcroppings of rocks, from the Archean era, which are part of the Guiana Shield and appear at heights called galleys. Likewise, in the Andean foothills, rocks from the Tertiary Period form hills and short slopes in the mountain range.

A large part of the state of Apure is constituted by an extensive field of dunes (occupying some 30,000 km²), which has the peculiarity of not being a desert climate but a savannah, with natural grasslands alternating with corridors of jungle and voluminous rivers with sand dunes of more than in length and 20 m in height. Some of these dunes are used by llaneros to establish dairy farms, which, in addition to processing milk, prepare a group of cattle to go to the head of the pack (which in the llanos is referred to as the godmother of the herd), according to the work of Calzadilla Valdés. 

Also, they allow the livestock to take refuge from the floods. The ecosystem in the savanna is the result of having been modeled by the wind (aeolian processes). It is not, as noted in the &quot;Atlas of Venezuela: A Spatial Image&quot; (&quot;Atlas de Venezuela: Una imagen espacial&quot;, also known as &quot;El Atlas de Petróleos de Venezuela&quot;), an ecosystem of &quot;paleodunas&quot;, literally &#x27;old dunes,&#x27; formed in an environment with a much drier climate than the current one, but a mechanism of dune formation that acts only in the dry season since the lowering of the water level of the Orinoco at the rivers&#x27; lowest point, especially that of those that originate in the llanos, extensive beaches of fine sand are left behind, that the trade winds very quickly will transfer to the southeast, forming what now constitutes el Parque Nacional Santos Luzardo (the Santos Luzardo National Park), which takes its name from one of the main characters in the novel &quot;Doña Bárbara&quot; by Rómulo Gallegos.
=== Terrain ===
It is almost entirely flat, with extensive plains from the convergence of the Apure, Arauca, and Capanaparo Rivers with the Orinoco to the foothills of the Andes. With little unevenness of terrain, the altitude fluctuates between 40 and 200 meters above sea level. 

The Apurean llanos feature several important physiographic events, generated by the type of soil, climate, and its hydrological pattern. Protruding between them are zones of dunes, delta plains, and such features as shoals, banks, and estuaries, which are very prone to floods during the rainy season. Furthermore, in the west of the territory, one finds foothills and mountains with altitudes of greater than 3 km, in a portion of the Cordillera Oriental Andina (Eastern Andean Range) that borders Estado Táchira.

=== Hydrography ===
The state is sliced by numerous rivers of great length and breadth, all of which are part of the Orinoco river basin. The Apure River, the most important of these, is at the same time the main Venezuelan tributary of the Orinoco from its left border, and the second longest in the country: it covers some from its source to its mouth. 

All of the lands in the south of the state constitute a zone where the springs, the branches, the rivers, the lagoons, and the swamps extraordinarily complicate the hydrography. Apure relies on an abundant phreatic zone that supplies the cities and towns with potable water, and a few decades ago networks of modules were created that allowed water storage for use in periods of drought. The most important rivers in the state are: the Apure for which the state is named; the Arauca, at more than long, which has its source in Colombia and forms the border between the two countries for a stretch, and unites the Apure by means of various branches and springs before flowing into the Orinoco; the Orichuna Channel at more than long; the Capanaparo, Cinaruco, Cunaviche, Matiyure, and Meta. The upper courses of the Apure River are formed by the Uribante and the Sarare, whose lower parts are found in the state of Apure.

===Climate===
The warm, rainy tropical savannah climate is dominant, with a severe dry season and a rainy season. Also, the temperature can be high all year round. 700 and the 1500 mm. Due to the characteristics of the state relief, the temperature presents a relative uniformity in almost all the territory. From the Andean foothills, temperatures will decrease in proportion to the increase in altitude, reaching up to 10 °C in the extreme northwest of the state, above 3,200 meters above sea level in El Tamá.

The shape of the precipitation distribution in the Apure state is one of the fundamental characteristics, being related to modifying factors such as latitude, relief, cold fronts and intertropical convergence.

===Soils===
They vary in quality and texture according to age and drainage, elements that influence the nature of the mixture. Similarly, exposure to very humid or somewhat drier climatic conditions is relevant. The result is uneven, so that the soils are distributed as follows: in the dune areas, they are acidic and low in nutrients; in sectors of constantly flooded plains, they are of medium quality and deficient in fertility; in the banks they have good drainage and medium textures; and in the northeast (towards Biruaca) they have extraordinary agricultural power.

===Vegetation===
In almost all the territory prevails a vegetation of savannah, herbaceous, grassland, scrub and bushes

==Politics and government==

It is an autonomous and politically equal state, organizing its administration and public powers through the Constitution of the State of Apure. The current Constitution was adopted on 15 October 2002 and partially reformed in 2005. Amendments or Reforms to the Constitution may be proposed by the Legislature, the governor, the majority of the Municipal Councils of the State or 10% of the voters. For an Amendment or Reform created by the Legislative Branch to be approved, it needs to receive an absolute majority of the votes of the parliamentarians, nor is it necessary to submit the reform to a referendum.

===Executive Power===

It is composed of the Governor of Apure State and a group of State Secretaries. The Governor is elected by the people by direct and secret vote for a period of four years and with the possibility of immediate re-election for equal periods, being in charge of the state administration. The formet governor is Ramon Carrizales of the PSUV party for the 2012–2016 term.

Since 1989 governors are directly elected by the citizens of the state, the current governor is Ramon Carrizales who has been in office since February 2011, appointed by the State Legislative Council according to the constitution of that entity to complete the remaining government period, after Governor-elect Jesus Aguilarte Gamez presented his resignation alleging &quot;health problems&quot;, Aguilarte&#x27;s administration was being questioned even by sectors of his own party had been serving as governor since 2004 and had been re-elected in 2008.
Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

===Legislative power===
The state legislature is the responsibility of the Legislative Council of Apure State, a unicameral parliament, elected by the people by direct and secret vote every four years, with the possibility of re-election for two consecutive periods, under a system of proportional representation of the population of the state and its municipalities.
== Municipalities and municipal seats ==

Apure is made up of 7 municipalities and 26 parishes. The municipalities Páez and Rómulo Gallegos make up the Distrito del Alto Apure.


== Demographics ==
With a population density of 7 inhabitants/km2, Apure is one of the most unpopulated states in the country. Extensive empty or almost uninhabited areas characterize its territory, traditionally affected by a strong emigration towards Aragua and the city of Caracas; nevertheless, the negative balance thrown by that phenomenon has been reverted when receiving an important flow of immigrants from the Venezuelan Andes and Colombia.

The population is mostly concentrated in urban areas and 48% is made up of young individuals between 10 and 40 years of age. Its main cities are: San Fernando and Guasdualito. Its main towns are Achaguas, Biruaca, Bruzual, Mantecal, El Amparo, Elorza, La Victoria, Puerto Paez and San Juan de Payara.

=== Race and ethnicity ===

According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:

==Economy==
Agriculture and livestock are the main economic activities in Apure State. Sugar cane, caraota, beans, fruit trees, oil palms, bananas and cassava, among others, are grown in the agricultural areas. The livestock sector is basically specialized in the production of cattle, concentrating about 30% of the heads of cattle in the whole national territory.

== Tourism==

Apure state has several national parks and herds or farms that receive national and foreign tourists

*Río Viejo National Park: this park was decreed to safeguard the San Camilo forest reserve and the Cutufí jungle, which are located to the south, on the border with Colombia. It is crossed by important rivers such as Cutufí, Nula, Sarare and Burguita. The plant and animal species are characteristic of the Venezuelan high plains.
*Santos Luzardo National Park: this park has a plain landscape whose limits are: to the south, the Cinaruco River bank; the Cinaruco River, in the most northern part; and the Orinoco River in the eastern part. The steppe has an extensive surface of dunes and the &quot;Galeras del Cinaruco&quot;, a geological phenomenon that reaches up to 200 meters above sea level and contrasts with the flat and low savannahs. The flat landscape finds its greatest expression here with gallery forests, flat lagoons, rivers, extensive beaches and islands. The vegetation shows a contrast of forest and savannah. You can find a wild fauna integrated by numerous species of birds, fish and terrestrial and aquatic mammals.
*El Tama National Park: this park of steep topography is a portion of the Venezuelan Andes that is characterized by a group of mountain ranges among which the Páramo de Tamá, the Serranía de Santa Bárbara, the Páramo Judío and the Páramo El Cobre stand out. It serves as protection for the high basins of numerous rivers such as the Cutufí. Its different altitudinal levels define four plant formations corresponding to premontane, humid, semi-cloudy forests and subalpine moors with common Andean endemic species. A variety of mammal species can be found, such as the spectacled bear, the paca, the tapir, the anteater and the cunaguar. Among the birds: the Inca hummingbird, the mountain partridge, the bay cockroach, the sun angel hummingbird, among others.

<text>Barinas State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. The state capital is Barinas.

Barinas State covers a total surface area of and had an estimated population of 970,689 in 2015.

==Toponymy==
The toponym &quot;Barinas&quot; is a variant of &quot;varinas&quot; (the name of an indigenous ethnic group that inhabited the Piedemonte before the arrival of the Spaniards); this may have a relationship with the name &quot;Barima&quot;, given by the tunebos to the Santo Domingo river in the Aya myth. The meaning is unknown, but according to popular belief, it means a &#x27;strong wind that comes from the valleys of the Santo Domingo river&#x27;, referring to the Barinese wind, which blows in the Llanos Altos.

According to Virgilio Tosta, the place name was first used before 1628 as an alternative name for Altamira; in contrast, according to Betancourt Martínez, it was in the foundations of Barinitas such as Nueva Trujillo de Barinas (1628) and Barinas (1759). It expanded with the creation of the Province of Barinas in 1786 and was reduced to the present region in 1859.

Because of this toponym, &quot;Senna aculeata&quot; – a low, thorny and yellow-flowered shrub in the state – is sometimes called the barinas flower, which is why it is the state flower.

==History==

Georg von Speyer and Nikolaus Federmann explored the region in 1534 on their way to the Andes.

In 1542, Philipp von Hutten traveled from Coro over this area en route towards Colombia. In 1547, Alonso Pérez de Tolosa, who came from El Tocuyo, also crossed the territory.

===Pre-Columbian era===
The pre-Columbian history of the Western Plains develops mainly around the present-day territory of Barinas, which was a highly mobile area where numerous indigenous ethnic groups from the Orinoco, the Amazon and the Andes interacted, using the rivers and highlands as convenient communication routes.

Starting in the 11th century and ending with the colonization, it is believed there were several successive occupations. At least 33 petroglyphs and many lithic types in the Piedemonte have been found, and more than a score of mounds and roads – long camels – that extend throughout the plain from Colombia have also been found; they may have been used for economic, military and/or religious purposes.

The indigenous presence began with the inhabitants of the Agua Blanca complex, about which there is not much information.

In 250, groups from the Oriente of Colombia and Ecuador started to settle in the Llano Medio of Bariné, due to its good soils and infrequent flooding. This occupation is characterized by the oldest roads and mounds found in the region today, and by the ceramic complex of the El Oso stream. Their settlements were sedentary and subsisted through the cultivation of corn, hunting and fishing. During this period, El Piedemonte was an area of exchange with Andean groups.

From 650 to 1200, Araucanian groups dominated the region, who inhabited its wooded areas and brought with them the chiefdoms and war relations. The period is also characterized by a remarkable population growth and an extension of the groups to the vicinity of the current Guanarito. A possible influence of the groups from central-west Venezuela can also be seen in the use of ceramics.

During different periods, the Arawak moved around the region, from which they left for Zulia and central-western Venezuela, introducing the cultivation of yucca and establishing trade routes throughout the Orinoco basin.

The Tunebos explored and occupied the Piedemonte and the Llanos Altos of the state, starting from the Sierra Nevada of El Cocuy and the savannas of Casanare, following their tradition of occupying three altitudinal levels and bringing a large part of the Chibcha element to the region.

===Spanish colonial period===

Before the colonization, the state was populated by numerous tribes, who were already organized in communal agricultural societies including the canaguaes, capas, cúcuaros, curaguas, caquetíos, curayes, dásaros, duriguas, guahibos, güeros, orúes, ticoporos, michayes, suripaes, torunos, tobores, tucuriguas, puyures and the varinas, among which the apures, aitures, amaibas, achaguas, baraures, barrancas stand out. These tribes disappeared or became extinct from the state due to colonization, but in many cases, their names remained as place names throughout the state, as is the case of Torunos and Barrancas.

In 1535, Europeans started to explore the region, this time on behalf of the Welsares, when the then governor, Jorge de Espira, crossed Barinas along with his group during his expedition in search for El Dorado del Meta and faced jirajaras along the way. Nicolás Federmán passed by the present Arismendi the same year. Philip of Utre, who had accompanied Espira, repeated his expedition in 1541. Alonso Pérez de Tolosa also crossed Barinas in 1549, heading for El Tocuyo, after he failed in a conquest entrusted to him by the then governor Juan Pérez de Tolosa.

====Altamira de Cáceres====
The colonization of Barinas began on June 30, 1577, when Captain Juan Andrés Varela, commissioned by the governor of La Grita Province, Francisco de Cáceres, founded the city of Altamira de Cáceres while choosing a mountainous place.

Altamira was a small city. Its inhabitants led a dangerous life being close to the jirajaras and had limited space. Due to the city&#x27;s precarious conditions, Varela resigned his post as mayor a few months after founding it, and, a decade later, its inhabitants desired to move.

In spite of the inconveniences, Altamira was populated for four decades thanks to cattle raising and tobacco cultivation, and was able to compete with Cuba in the beginning. The population of the city did not prosper as expected, reaching only sixteen Creoles and 250 Indians, in spite of the fact that, according to Virgilio Tosta, &quot;tobacco turned the primitive Barinas into a globally famous name&quot;.

====New Trujillo of Barinas====
The citizens of Altamira gradually moved towards El Llano, until in 1628, by order of the governor of the Province of Mérida and La Grita, Juan Pacheco Maldonado, the city was refounded as &quot;Nueva Trujillo de Barinas&quot; – today Barinitas. This was because the plateau was closer to the Llanos, which they wanted to conquer, while having better land for livestock and tobacco cultivation (which had become intensive due to the high demand and had generated a great deal of smuggling led by the Dutch).

Nueva Trujillo is considered the &quot;gateway to the conquest of the Llanos&quot;, because from here, important settlements were founded in view of the Llanos: the town of doctrine of Nuestra Señora de la Concepción del Curay (1619, which is La Barinesa today), the city of Nuestra Señora de Pedraza (1951, which is Ciudad Bolivia today) and the Indian towns of Santa Bárbara and Curbatí.

After the sacking of Maracaibo and the burning of Gibraltar by the Dutch (1641), the Barinese thought of alternate trade routes; thus, in 1647, Miguel de Ochogavia undertook the successful expedition to discover the Santo Domingo-Apure-Orinoco connection, through which the subsequent conquest of Apure was carried out. This discovery led to the subsequent emergence of the ports of Torunos and Nutrias.

====Spanish province of Barinas====
The progressive pacification of the Indians, the development of extensive cattle raising, the general interest in evading the taxes of the Crown and the fall in demand for tobacco by the end of the 17th century caused the Barinese to abandon the table of Moromoy in order to populate the savannas around the rivers Santo Domingo, Masparro and Boconó. The Barinese established their herds there and formed important towns, such as Sabaneta, Barrancas and Obispos. For this reason, on July 11, 1759, the Viceroy of the New Granada, Jose Solis, decreed the definitive foundation of Barinas, with the name and on the current place – where the town of San Antonio de los Cerritos was by then, in order to establish a center of power closer to the new towns.

Barinas was part of the Captaincy General of Venezuela since its creation. On February 15, 1786, King Carlos III decreed, over a territory that extended to cover the current states of Apure and Portuguesa, the creation of the Province of Barinas, separating it from Maracaibo. During this period, there was a remarkable diversification and economic growth, stimulated by the trade and cultivation of tobacco, sugar, indigo, cocoa, cotton, onoto and coffee. The Spaniards also built the first prison and hospital. There was a great population growth, as census records show.

Barinas defeated the Comuneros of the Andes (1781), a fact that led to King Carlos IV granting it, in 1790, the coat of arms that today retains the state capital, along with the motto &quot;very noble and very loyal&quot;.

===Independence process===
Barinas joined the process of the Supreme Board of Caracas on May 5, 1810, thus constituting a Board of Government and Conservation, in which the desire to break with the Crown was formed. In 1811, the Declaration of Independence Act was signed, thus forming part of the First Republic, which fell the following year.

After the patriotic victory in the Battle of Niquitao on July 2, 1813, Barinas became part of the Second Republic, which also fell the following year. Paez&#x27;s campaigns ensured the patriotic victory in Barinas during the Third Republic, in which Venezuela&#x27;s independence was consolidated.

Young Barineses like José Antonio Páez and Pedro Briceño Méndez were important heroes of the Independence.

===Contemporary period===
====The Province of Barinas during the contemporary period====
During the existence of Greater Colombia, there were several political-administrative changes. In 1821, the Congress of Cúcuta created the Department of Venezuela, which included Barinas. Two years later, the Congress of the Republic separated the current territory of the State of Apure from Barinas, making it a province, with the capital in Achaguas.

In 1824, in view of the Territorial Division Law, the Department of Venezuela disappeared and the Department of Apure was created, which consisted of the provinces of Barinas and Apure. Two years later, these provinces became part of the Department of Orinoco, along with Guayana.

After the dissolution of the Great Colombia, the cantons of Guanare, Ospino and Araure initiated managements to segregate themselves from the Province of Barinas, which would occur in 1851, when the National Congress erected the Province of Portuguesa.

====Barinas State====
During the Federal War (1859–1863), General Ezequiel Zamora maintained federalist control of all the Western Plains from Barinas, and consolidated it with the Battle of Santa Inés on December 10, 1859; after this victory, Zamora left the proclaimed state to besiege San Carlos, at which he was killed. In honor of him, Barinas was renamed &quot;Zamora&quot; in 1862, recovering its original name in 1936. As for all the other provinces, Barinas became a de jure state since the proclamation of the United States of Venezuela, with the Constitution of 1864, thus repealing the ephemeral merger it had with Apure during the last year of the war.

On April 30, 1879, in accordance with the Guzmancism&#x27;s plan for the reduction of states, it was proposed the conformation of the South State of the West from the territories of the states of Barinas, Carabobo, Portuguesa and Cojedes and the Department of Nirgua of the State of Yaracuy, denominated as &quot;sections&quot;; however, after the protest of Barinitas for the distance of Valencia as capital, such union was given excluding Carabobo and Nirgua. Barinas proposed to include Apure as part of the State.

Despite the fact that the South West later acquired the name &quot;Zamora&quot;, the centre of power was not in Barinas, but in Ospino, provisionally, and then in Guanare. At the end of the 1880s and in view of the secessionist movement of Cojedes, the idea of the disintegration of the South West in Barinas was promoted. This led to the separation of the sections of Zamora on April 22, 1899, by Ignacio Andrade&#x27;s government. However, the previous degree of autonomy was not granted.

In 1989, the states were granted greater political autonomy with the country&#x27;s first regional elections.
==Geography==

===Relief and geology===
The Western Plains predominate. The plains extend from the Camaguán marshes in the far east and rise in height towards the west, thus dividing into the Lower Plains, up to 120 m above sea level, the Middle Plains, up to 160 m above sea level, and the Upper Plains, up to 200 m above sea level.

This plain ends abruptly where Troncal 5 passes, in a line that goes from the town of Las Veguitas to Punta de Piedras, from which the Mérida mountain range begins, the final part of the Andina. The lowest and least rugged section of this part of the mountain range is the Sierra del Piedemonte, in which hills, small mountains, depressions and mesas predominate. The highest and most rugged parts are the Sierra Nevada, the Sierra del Tapo-Caparo and the Sierra de Calderas, with the first peak close to 4 000 m above sea level inside Barinas, and the last one has a lot of valleys. The tables of Moromoy, El Curay and Parangula are landmarks that separate the high and low parts. Two large passes are found, both to the north: the pass of the valleys and the depression of the Santo Domingo River and the pass of the Boconó River valleys.

In the Paleozoic, the Merida mountain range was formed as an island. The sediments of this mountain range accumulated to the east and west, giving way to the formation of the Llanos, around the Mesozoic.

The most important geological formations in the state are Palmarito; Caparo, with fossiliferous shales; and Sabaneta, with sandstone.

=== Hydrography ===

Barinas is characterized by an abundance of rivers, so many that its capital is considered &quot;the capital of the rivers of Venezuela&quot;. All its rivers originate in the east of the Mérida mountain range and flow into the left bank of the Apure River, which has, for the most part, short upper and middle courses; the river floods the Llanos Bajos during rainy periods. The tributaries of the river in Barinas are the Portuguesa, Masparro, Santo Domingo, Caparo, Canaguá and Uribante Rivers, all of which are navigable. Some rivers that flow through the Piedemonte give rise to depressions around it. There are three reservoirs in the state: those of the rivers Boconó, Masparro and Caparo.

===Climate===
Being in the intertropical zone and extending more towards the meridians than the parallels, Barinas has a climate determined by altitude, winds and two seasons: the dry season, from October to March, and the rainy season, from April to September. Of these factors, the altitude modifies the temperatures more forcefully. The cold winds that flow from the east of the Mérida mountain range to the Llanos Altos cause the characteristic phenomenon of the Barinese wind. According to Köppen&#x27;s classification, the Sierra del Tapo-Caparo and the Llanos have a savanna climate (Aw); the Piedemonte and Alto Apure, a monsoon climate (Am); the Sierra Nevada and Sierra de Calderas, a humid mountain climate (Cfbi); and the highest parts of the last two mountain ranges, a tropical alpine climate (ETH).

===Flora and fauna===
Barinas has two ecoregions: the Llanos and the Northern Andes, the latter being its center of endemism.

The Llanos constitute extensive grasslands and abundant gallery forests. In its flora, there are many trees, such as the apamate; jabillo; samán; ceiba; mango; merecure; cañafístola llanera; and the araguaney, the national tree. There are also many palms, especially the llanera. Among the herbs, the water lilies and the mother-of-pearl and barina flowers stand out.

The Mérida mountain range has, from its highlands to its foothills, moors, tropical mountain forests and wooded savannas. Among its vegetation, the cardón, cují, bucare and frailejones are characteristic in its upper parts, while in the foothills, pardillo, granadilla, caobas and vera grows.

There are more than 450 species of birds, among which are the prey species – especially the Andean condor, herons, storks, ducks, the parachute, the Orinoco woodpecker and the carrao.

Mammals are the most abundant vertebrates, highlighting the deer, foxes, otters, anteaters, honey bears, cachicamos, cunaguars, jaguars, spider monkeys, capuchins, rabbits and chigüires. Rabbits, spectacled bears, porcupines and shrews are only found in the Andes.

In the Llanos, there are many reptiles, including anacondas, podocnemids, iguanas, rattlesnakes, babo, jicotea turtles, mato real, Orinoco caiman and mapanare. The rivers are inhabited by catfish, piranhas, goldfish and electric eels.

There are also two species in danger of extinction: the morrocoy sabanero and tonina.
==Government and politics==
Barinas is part of the Venezuelan federation, which is symmetrical: each entity has its own legal personality, competences, income and autonomous executive and legislative power, with authorities elected by majority rule in universal, direct and secret suffrage for four-year periods and revocable by referendum. They also have their own autonomous comptroller&#x27;s and procurator&#x27;s office and a council for planning and coordinating public policies. Venezuela&#x27;s states are obliged to maintain independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to comply with and enforce the Constitution and the law.

The Barinas law emphasizes decentralization as the main goal.

The foundations of the essence of Barinas are in the ethical and moral heritage of its people; in the values of freedom, equality, justice, cooperation, solidarity and independence; in the personal values and spiritual potential of its people; in its natural resources; and in its history, traditions, customs, idiosyncrasy, folklore, art and own aspirations. Barinas also protects biodiversity, which includes cultural diversity.

The aims of Barinas are to protect and defend people and their dignity, facilitate the exercise of popular will and citizen participation in public affairs, maintain freedom, promote private initiative and free enterprise and the welfare of people.

The citizens of Barinas are obliged by law to protect the family; know, promote and protect the cultural heritage; contribute to economic and human development; encourage private initiative; promote free enterprise; and reject violence. They also have the right to participate freely in state public affairs, in the exercise of control, monitoring and supervision of public management and in the processes of decentralization.

===Executive===
The executive power of each state is exercised by the governors. In the case of Barinas, they would have only been reelected once, until the national constitution was reformed in 2009. The governor of Barinas is elected by direct universal and secret ballots every four years and has his secretaries as assistants. According to the law, the government aims to achieve the spiritual, educational and economic elevation of the people, create a framework of incentives that allow the achievement of technological innovations that contribute to the integral development of the state and create the conditions that raise the levels of productivity.

====Governors====

Zenaida Gallardo was sworn in as the governor of Barinas State on January 5, 2017, replacing Adán Chávez, who was appointed as Minister for Culture on January 4, 2017. Gallardo resigned a few months later, citing health reasons. In June 2017, Argenis Chávez, brother of former president Hugo Chávez, was sworn in as governor.

Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the state maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

===Legislative===
The legislative power of each state in Venezuela is exercised by a legislative council, made up of seven to fifteen legislators each, who proportionally represent the population of their states and their municipalities. State legislators can be reelected only twice. The seat of the Legislative Council of Barinas is the Manuel Palacio Fajardo building; its powers are limited to those designated by the constitutions and laws.

==Territorial division==
Barinas is divided into municipalities, which in turn are subdivided into parishes. The twelve municipalities of Barinas are organized according to population conditions (which must be greater than 10,000), economic development, capacity to generate their own income, geographical situation, historical and cultural elements and other factors. They constitute historical institutions of natural law and are considered to be the most cohesive entities after the family.

The parishes are considered to be the best places to achieve greater efficiency in the management of local governments, citizen participation and decentralization.

==Economy==

The mining potential is expressed by non-metallic minerals, such as limestone, sand, silicate, quartz, red clay, feldspar, gravel, silica sand and phosphorite. As for energy resources, there are hydrocarbon reserves in the southern zone of San Silvestre, where PDVSA exploits several oil fields. In 2001, Repsol YPF was awarded the Barrancas block for the production of two-million cubic meters of free gas per day. The gas is fed to the Termobarrancas electric plant in the Obispos municipality, with a generation capacity of 450 megawatts.

Agricultural production in Barinas is very important for the local economy as well as livestock production. The fertile soils provide the necessary conditions for the production of corn, sorghum, banana, cocoa, coffee, cotton and sesame. These items are the main axis of agriculture in Barinas State.

==Tourism==

Barinas has a contrast between landscapes of mountains, plains, rivers and streams, offering tourists a variety of options, from contemplating rare species in their habitat, to enjoying its spectacular parks and natural spas.

From the city of Barinas to the state of Merida, passing through the municipality of Bolivar, which includes the towns of Barinitas, Altamira de Caceres and Calderas, with a pleasant climate, characteristic of the tropical rainforest.

Barinitas, the capital of the municipality, has places for tourism: the Moromoy Park for camping; the Balneario La Barinesa, which has recreational facilities; and, towards the southeast, the El Cacao Sector, for mountain biking practice. There is also the boulevard of Plaza Bolívar and the San Pedro Church. The route that leads to Altamira de Cáceres is used for bird watching because of the diversity of species.

Altamira de Cáceres is the first seat (1577) of what is today the city of Barinas. It still preserves its colonial architecture, with its historic red-roofed houses.

The Plaza Bolívar was converted into a boulevard; in its surroundings, the church can be found, along with the Alfredo Arvelo Larriva House of Culture, inns, restaurants, wine cellars, bakeries, shops and handicrafts.

&quot;Los Castillos&quot; mill is located near the &quot;La Bellaca&quot; farmhouse, close to the town of Calderas; the artisan process of making panela is carried out at the mill, which was produced by the locals since past times.

In Calderas, there are natural places with recreational facilities, such as the &quot;La Piedra del Patio&quot; spa, on the banks of the Azul River. The house of Avelino Moreno culture and the &quot;Centro de Enseñanza para el Desarrollo Rural&quot; (CENDER) is located here.

Near the city of Barinas, there are two important reservoirs: the Manuel Palacio Fajardo (Masparro), located 15 minutes from the town of Barrancas, and Juan Antonio Rodriguez Dominguez (Boconó - Tucupido), located on the border with the Portuguese State; tourists can go on boat trips, kayaking, jet skiing, bird watching, and controlled sport fishing. The population of Obispos (founded in 1713) is dominated by the cultivation of mussels, corn, cotton, sorghum and forest products, in addition to livestock and oil exploitation.

Obispos has a colonial temple of San Nicolás de Bari, which was built in the 18th century, and hosts popular activities such as the joropo, corrío, coplas, tonadas, bullfighting and patron saint festivities.

Near Trunk 5 are the towns of Mijagual, Santa Rosa, Libertad, Dolores, City of Otters and Puerto de Nutrias. There are large scale plantations of oilseeds, cereals, sugar cane, tomatoes and yucca and fruit trees, as well as a livestock area.

In Sabaneta, the cultural aspect of Los Diablos Danzantes de San Hipólito stands out; in the musical aspect, there are the celebrations of the Festival de la Bandola in the town of Dolores (December), the Festival de la Libertad and La Paz (January) and the making of typical musical instruments in the town of Libertad.

In El Real, in the month of January and at various times of the year, the inhabitants of this area and pilgrims from various parts of the world venerate the image of Nuestra Señora del Rosario del Real, which appeared in the mid-17th century.

Near the Paguey River is the village of San Silvestre, which, in December, celebrates its patron saint&#x27;s festival in honour of San Silvestre, where bullfighting is one of the most popular tourist events in the village.

Another site of interest is the Sierra Nevada National Park located between the state of Merida and Barinas. It is a protected ecosystem that has forests, moors, xerophilous scrubs and the highest mountains in the country, such as Pico Bolivar (5,007 m), the Humboldt Peak (4,920 m), Bompland (4,942 m), La Concha (4,920 m), El Toro (4,755 m) and El Leon (4,740 m).

The Balneario Municipal and El Balneario Río Boconó, located on the banks of the Cipe River, are natural spas surrounded by lush trees.

Around Peña Viva, there is a vast network of pre-Columbian petroglyphs that constitute the richest and most complete sample known in Venezuela today.

Barinas has a botanical garden located within the Universidad Nacional Experimental de Los Llanos Ezequiel Zamora.

<text>Bolívar (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. The state capital city is Ciudad Bolívar and the largest city is Ciudad Guayana. Bolívar State covers a total surface area of and as of the 2011 census, had a population of 1,410,964. The state contains Angel Falls.

==History==

===Spanish Colonization===
During the time of the Spanish Empire, it was part of the province of Nueva Andalucía and later it was annexed to the province of Guayana from 1777 when King Charles III created the Captaincy General of Venezuela.

The capital of the state, Ciudad Bolivar was founded on December 21, 1595 by Antonio de Berrío, who had come from Nueva Granada (present-day Colombia) with the mission of populating Guyana. The town, originally called Santo Tomás de Guayana, was a fortified port that had to move three times, since it was the target of constant assaults by Caribbean Indians and European corsairs, among whom Sir Walter Raleigh stood out in 1617.

In 1764 it found a definitive site on the banks of the Orinoco, in its narrowest sector, for which it took the name of Santo Tomás de la Nueva Guayana de la Angostura del Orinoco, known simply as Angostura, a name that has persisted for over 80 years and is still remembered today.

In 1800, Baron Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland visited Angostura and from there they went through El Pao to Barcelona and then to Cumaná, thus ending the tour of Venezuela.

===Independence Era===
The Congress of Angostura, inaugurated on February 15, 1819 by the Liberator Simón Bolívar, under the inspiration of General Francisco de Miranda&#x27;s Ideology, represented the second Constituent Congress of the Republic of Venezuela. It was convened in the context of the wars of independence of Venezuela and the New Granada.

In 1821 (during the Great Colombia) it became a department of Orinoco with the largest extension of the time (whose capital was Santo Tomás de la Nueva Guayana de la Angostura del Orinoco or Angostura).

When Gran Colombia was dissolved, the territory changed to the Province of Guayana until 1854 when it became the Province of Orinoco (whose capital was Ciudad Bolívar).

===19th century===
After the separation in 1856 of the then Federal Territory Amazonas, the province of Guayana was renamed in 1864 as the Sovereign State of Guayana once the Federal Revolution came to power under the command of Juan Crisóstomo Falcón.

In 1864, Guyana became one of the independent states of the United States of Venezuela. In 1879, it was one of the seven states of the Federation, without the territory corresponding to Amazonas which had become Federal Territory Amazonas.

In 1881, it became one of the nine political entities into which the country was divided, receiving the name of Great State Bolivar formed by Guayana and Apure. Its territory was diminished with the creation of the federal territories Yuruari and El Caura (1881), Armisticio (1883) and Delta (1884). Between 1890 and 1893, it recovered these territories. 

In 1887, the current state of Delta Amacuro was separated from the state of Guayana. In 1899, the Apure and Guayana States were separated and established their autonomy; and it is from the 1901 Constitution that the name of Guayana State is changed to Bolivar State, as a tribute to the Liberator, Simón Bolívar. 

In Angostura, Bolívar convened the Second Congress of the Republic of Venezuela on February 15, 1819. His inaugural speech and the constitution he proposed comprise the last of the three most important documents of his career. The &quot;Correo del Orinoco&quot; was also published between 1818 and 1820, giving birth to the Venezuelan free press.

=== 20th century ===
On 21 July 1903, in the vicinity of Ciudad Bolivar, the last battle of the Liberating Revolution was fought where the government army under the command of Juan Vicente Gómez defeated the opposition forces of General Nicolás Rolando. The defeat of the Liberating Revolution marked the end of the 19th century in Venezuela, which was characterized by political instability and great civil wars, giving way to a period of consolidation of the central government under the rule of Andean leaders.

The state gained more autonomy in 1989 when the first elections for governor and legislative assembly were held and the practice of appointments from the central government in Caracas was ended.

On 13 November 2006, the Orinoquia Bridge was inaugurated, the second largest in the country, which facilitates communications between Ciudad Guayana and the opposite bank of the Orinoco River in the states of Anzoátegui and Monagas.

The Orinoco Mining Arc (AMO), officially created, on 24 February 2016, as the Arco Mining Orinoco National Strategic Development Zone, 2 is an area rich in mineral resources that the Republic of Venezuela has been operating since 2017; occupies mostly the north of the Bolivar state and to a lesser extent the northeast of the Amazonas state and part of the Delta Amacuro state. It has 7,000 tons of reserves of gold, copper, diamond, coltan, iron, bauxite and other minerals.

==Geography==
===Geographical location===
It is bordered to the north by the Orinoco River and the States of Delta Amacuro, Monagas, Anzoátegui and Guárico; to the south by the Federative Republic of Brazil; to the southwest by the State of Amazonas; to the east by the territory of Guayana Esequiba, in dispute with the Cooperative Republic of Guyana; and to the west by the State of Apure.

Three major landscapes can be recognized in a relief between the Guiana shield: the isolated Orinoco savannahs and low mountains, the mountainous landscape dominated by the tabular peaks of the Tepuis and the valleys of the tributaries of the Orinoco and the lowlands and partly savannahs of the Yuruari, limited to the east by the Imataca mountain range.

===Relief===
Almost all of the state is occupied by the Guiana massif; this suffered epirogenic movements that reactivated the basal rock of the shield, cut by fluvial erosion, reached it and gave rise to a staggering of jumps, originating tabular reliefs known as tepuis.

The Tepuis are located mainly in the center and south of the structure. The average altitude is , with a generalized south-north slope. The highest plateaus exceed . The highest point is Mount Roraima (), located in the Pacaraima Range, which continues south with those of Parima and Tapirapeco. The north of the massif is quite homogeneous, with heights below 400 m and numerous witness hills. In the northeast, the Nuria and Imataca mountains stand out, as well as plateaus and hills over high drained by the Yuruari River. The southeast sector is separated from the northwest sector by the Erebato River and the upper Ventuari Valley. It comprises the Great Savannah and the rest of the territory west of the Caroni River, made up of three high plateaus. The southwest of the massif is made up of lowlands through which the Ventuari, Alto Río Negro and Alto Orinoco rivers flow, with flat topography interrupted by witness hills.

===Hydrography===

Except for the area comprised in the Yuruari- Cuyuni river basin, the entire state is included in the Orinoco drainage system. Among the most important rivers are the Caroní, the Paragua and the Caura, etc. All of them dig their courses through a rugged topography in the hard rocks of the Guiana shield, giving rise to rapid valleys and waterfalls. In the case of the Caroní River, these unevennesses have allowed the establishment of powerful hydroelectric plants. The Guri Reservoir and the Simón Bolívar Hydroelectric Plant (formerly Raúl Leoni), which covers more than 80,000 hectares, is the most important center for electricity generation in Venezuela. The Churún River, a tributary of the Caroní River, flows from the Auyan Tepui plateau, with a 936.60-meter drop: Angel Falls, the highest in the world.

===Climate===
The average annual temperature (Max-Min) is between in the Puerto Ordaz area, between in the Ciudad Bolivar zone, and between in the Gran Sabana Zone. The climate is tropical, although it varies according to the zones; thus, the low areas present high temperatures, which reach an average of , and abundant rainfall. The variation of the climate of the extensive territory is determined by the altitude and the winds since the latitude (between 4° and 8° of North latitude) places it totally in the equatorial strip. The low northern lands, influenced by the east and northeast winds, are characterized by a rainy season and a dry season, both very marked; the southern lands receive winds loaded with humidity from the Amazon depression and from the southeast that condense at the contact of the elevations producing intense rains of more than 1600 mm.

===Area===
The State of Bolivar is the largest state in Venezuela and covers a large area of 242,801 km² which represents 26.49% of the national total. In addition, de Iure claims the territories of Guayana Esequiba south of the Cuyuni River, Cuyuni-Mazaruni, Potaro-Siparuni and Alto Tacutu-Alto Esequibo, which would increase the territory by 124,414 km².

The geography of the State of Bolivar is as follows: the State of Bolivar is located in the southeast of Venezuela, it has jungle vegetation and a savannah climate, the State is mostly limited by the Orinoco River. It borders on several Venezuelan states and on the republics of Guyana and Brazil.
==Politics and government==
The State is autonomous and politically equal to the rest of the Federation. It organizes its administration and its public powers through the Constitution of the State of Bolivar, approved by the Legislative Council in Ciudad Bolivar on July 2, 2001.

===Executive Power===
It is composed of the Governor of the State of Bolivar and a group of State Secretaries. The Governor is elected by the people through direct and secret vote for a period of four years and with the possibility of being reelected continuously, being in charge of the state administration. The current Governor is Justo Noguera Pietri of the PSUV.
Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

===Legislative power===
The State Legislature is the responsibility of the unicameral Legislative Council of the State of Bolivar, elected by the people through direct and secret vote every four years, with the possibility of continuous re-election, under a system of proportional representation of the population of the State and its municipalities. The State has 15 deputies, of which 4 belong to the opposition and 11 to the ruling party, including a representation of the indigenous peoples and communities of the State of Bolivar.

In the State of Bolivar there are great energy sources that are very important for Venezuela (the Guri Dam, among others), famous agricultural products (Guiana cheese, cotton, yucca, cassava, white and brown catalinas, naiboa, among others), and many minerals in great demand (iron, gold, bauxite, among others). located in Ciudad Guayana.
===Agriculture===
The agricultural sector of Bolivar State has little significance, both at the state and national level. The soil, topography, and climate characteristics have led to consider the area as a strong restriction for agricultural development, since a large part of its soils are composed of highly siliceous rocks, with low moisture retention capacity and strong acid reaction. Nevertheless, the exploitation of a great variety of agricultural items, the immense reserves of forest resources, allow us to foresee that through the use of appropriate technology, irrigation and selection of the size of the exploitation, this sector could contribute in an important way in the integral development of the area.

===Siderurgy===
Bolivar State has the Siderurgica del Orinoco (SIDOR), which is in charge of steel production with Direct Reduction technologies and Electric Arc Furnaces, with natural resources available in the Guayana region.

===Coltan===
By 2017, coltan production will begin through Parguaza, a company established by the Venezuelan state and the Venezuelan Corporation Faoz.

===Forest Resources===
Some woods are exploited, many of them precious like bucare, mahogany and others like plum, crawl, guamo, sarrapia and carob.

==Tourism==

The state of Bolivar has some of the most important tourist attractions in Venezuela and South America among which the Angel Falls (the world&#x27;s largest waterfall) and numerous characteristic mountains called Tepuis such as Mount Roraima, as well as many natural wells, caves, rivers, fluvial islands, forests, rock formations, waterfalls and lakes of all types.

===Historical sites===
====Castles of Guayana====
30 km from San Félix on the road to Piacoa in the State of Delta Amacuro, you will find Los Castillos de Guayana, buildings built on rocky hills on the right bank of the Orinoco River during the colonial era to protect Santo Tomé de Guayana from attacks by pirates and adventurers who feverishly sought El Dorado, the most fabulous of our indigenous inventions that would drive the feverish minds of the conquistadors mad.

==== Castillo de San Francisco de Asís ====
The first of the castles, San Francisco de Asís (Fuerte Villapol) was built on the banks of the Orinoco in the 17th century between 1678 and 1684, as referred to by Gerónimo Martínez-Mendoza, by order of the Governor Cap. Tiburcio de Axpe y Zúñiga, in the narrowest part of the Orinoco after Angostura, on the land where San Francisco&#x27;s auspices once stood, established by Don Antonio de Berrío, the first governor of Guayana and founder of Santo Tomé de Guayana.

====Castillo San Diego====

Years later and to reinforce the defenses of the first castle was built the Castle of El Padrastro or San Diego - construction began in 1747 - so called because it was located on a hillock or stepfather, from where you can see the Castle of San Francisco which it protects. These castles were restored in 1897 by the then President of Venezuela, Joaquín Crespo, who renamed them Fuerte Campo Elías al Castillo de San Diego and Fuerte Villapol al Castillo de San Francisco, in honor of these heroes who, despite being born in Spain, fought in the Republican ranks during the war of independence.

====Ruins of the Caroni Missions====
They are called the Ruins of the Mission of the Purísima Concepción del Caroni, or better known as &quot;Las Misiones del Caroni&quot;. These ruins served as the governing house of the Catalan Capuchins, and were declared a National Historic Monument on August 2, 1960. It exemplifies a magnificent building belonging to the colonial architecture, finally built with stones, bricks, tiles, wood and mortar, which gave it a structure strong enough to be preserved through the centuries.

A bell tower, the chapel and a mural composed of images representing the sun and moon, clouds and angels, as well as silhouettes, which presumably represent the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception and Saint Francis of Assisi, are components that can be seen inside this rectangular space that follows the structure of the main nave of the temple or church. The same is provided with a parking lot that communicates to the temple by means of a paved road, and connects to the bank of the Macagua reservoir.

==Culture==

In many indigenous cultures of the State of Bolivar there are musical and artisan manifestations. In other environments the joropo is danced, exactly in the northwest of the state, due to the proximity of the plains of Guariqueños and Apureños. The passage, the blows, the tunes to the sound of the harp, cuatro and maracas, are characteristic of this area of Bolivar. The carnivals in El Callao are very colorful and have already gained fame and tradition with the peculiar Guayana Calypso. This dance originated with the arrival of the Antilleans who brought their customs and their typical English, it was mixed with ours emerging along with the local patois and many other customs.

The craftsmanship in the State of Bolivar is mostly referred to basketwork, made with moriche palm. The Indians make objects that are utilitarian and that are very sought after by tourists such as peony seed necklaces, San Pedro tears, toucan peaks, etc...

*Yanomamo family: sanemá
*English: Saint Martin de Turumban

In addition, there are isolated languages such as joti. The Arutani-sapé languages have probably become extinct. According to article 9 of the Constitution of the State of Bolivar of 2001, Spanish is the official language of the State and all the indigenous languages are official for their respective peoples.

===Folklore===
In the numerous indigenous cultures of the State of Bolivar, there are musical and artisanal manifestations.

The inhabitants of the jungle use reed flutes and rattles for their spiritual invocations or for joy in moments of collective expansion.

In other environments the joropo is danced, exactly in the northwest of the State, due to the proximity to the plains of Guariqueños and Apureños; the passage, the blows, the tunes to the sound of the harp, maracas and cuatro are characteristic in this area of the State of Bolivar.

Penetrating into the interior, the carnivals in El Callao are very colorful, and they already have fame and tradition with the peculiar Calypso.

The Guiana Calypso originated with the arrival of Antilleans to the State, who brought their customs in their typical English, mixed with ours, giving rise to the Calypso and many other customs. A notable figure of the carnival groups and its main sponsor was the popularly called la Negra Isidora, who gave much importance to this spectacle.
===Gastronomy===
The gastronomy of the State of Bolivar is the result of the fusion of several Venezuelan indigenous cultures. It is characterized by the use of yucca, merey, corn and pescaculodo, from which dishes with unique and extraordinary flavors are derived.

The State of Bolivar has a very varied gastronomy using the products of the zone, being the cassava (prepared from the yucca) the main companion of the diverse plates, standing out then the fish of river known as the sapoara and the merey from where diverse candies, nougats, etc are prepared. There are also varieties of cheese such as: telita, queso de mano and guayanés, among others.

The sapoara, a gastronomic tradition of the State of Bolivar, is a fish that abounds in the vicinity of the Orinoco and Caroní rivers. It is famous in Ciudad Bolivar and in general in all the zones bordering the Orinoco River. This fish is prepared in sancocho, fried, stuffed and roasted. It is defined by specialists as the most characteristic and distinctive fish of Ciudad Bolívar because of its habit of appearing once a year, being one of the few places where it can be fished, in front of the Orinoco promenade in Ciudad Bolívar.

Fishing for the toad takes place exactly in front of the dock where the boats that transport the inhabitants of Ciudad Bolivar and Soledad arrive. Here, the great celebration of the city takes place during the month of August every year, internationally known as &quot;La Feria de la Sapoara&quot;.

One of the dishes prepared with the sapoara, is the gilthead, baked, stuffed and the morrocoy cake cut in wheels, in sancocho and the rest remains in the imagination of the housewives or the great chefs of the gastronomic field that abound in the State.

Thus, the recipes of the specialists who have been cooking for years for the demanding national and international palates, suggest that the fish can be prepared fried (dorado), having salt and garlic as main ingredients. If the preference is to eat it baked, do not forget to open it from the back and cover it with salt, applying various condiments such as chopped seasoning (chili, onion, paprika), mustard, etc., and fill it with vegetables and egg and then wrap it in aluminum foil, placing it in the oven until it browns. This dish can be accompanied by yucca, salad and rice or with some potatoes au gratin, all according to the taste of each person.

Sancocho de sapoara, is undoubtedly also a delight of the culinary art of the State of Bolivar; it is prepared like any soup and you add the vegetables and seasonings you want. This fish, due to its condition and unique appearance during one month of the year, forces everyone to enjoy its nutrients and rich flavor.

<text>Copper(II) nitrate describes any member of the family of inorganic compounds with the formula Cu(NO3)2(H2O)x. The hydrates are hygroscopic blue solids. Anhydrous copper nitrate forms blue-green crystals and sublimes in a vacuum at 150-200 °C. Common hydrates are the hemipentahydrate and trihydrate.

==Synthesis and reactions==
===Hydrated copper(II) nitrate ===
Hydrated copper nitrate is prepared by treating copper metal or its oxide with nitric acid:
The same salts can be prepared treating copper metal with an aqueous solution of silver nitrate. That reaction illustrates the ability of copper metal to reduce silver ions.

In aqueous solution, the hydrates exist as the aqua complex . Such complexes are highly labile and subject to rapid ligand exchange due to the d9 electronic configuration of copper(II).

Attempted dehydration of any of the hydrated copper(II) nitrates by heating affords the oxides, not . At 80 °C the hydrates convert to &quot;basic copper nitrate&quot;, , which converts to at 180 °C. Exploiting this reactivity, copper nitrate can be used to generate nitric acid by heating it until decomposition and passing the fumes directly into water. This method is similar to the last step in the Ostwald process. The equations are as follows:
:

Treatment of copper(II) nitrate solutions with triphenylphosphine, triphenylarsine, and triphenylstibine gives the corresponding copper(I) complexes (E = P, As, Sb; Ph = ). The group V ligand is oxidized to the oxide.

===Anhydrous copper(II) nitrate ===
Anhydrous is one of the few anhydrous transition metal nitrates. It cannot be prepared by reactions containing or producing water. Instead, anhydrous forms when copper metal is treated with dinitrogen tetroxide:

==Structure==
===Anhydrous copper(II) nitrate===
Two polymorphs of anhydrous copper(II) nitrate, α and β, are known. Both polymorphs are three-dimensional coordination polymer networks with infinite chains of copper(II) centers and nitrate groups. The α form has only one Cu environment, with [4+1] coordination, but the β form has two different copper centers, one with [4+1] and one that is square planar.

The nitromethane solvate also features &quot;[4+1] coordination&quot;, with four short Cu-O bonds of approximately 200 pm and one longer bond at 240 pm.

Heating solid anhydrous copper(II) nitrate under a vacuum to 150-200 °C leads to sublimation and &quot;cracking&quot; to give a vapour of monomeric copper(II) nitrate molecules. In the vapour phase, the molecule features two bidentate nitrate ligands. 

===Hydrated copper(II) nitrate===
Five hydrates have been reported: the monohydrate (), the sesquihydrate (), the hemipentahydrate (), a trihydrate (), and a hexahydrate (. The crystal structure of the hexahydrate appeared to show six almost equal Cu–O distances, not revealing the usual effect of a Jahn-Teller distortion that is otherwise characteristic of octahedral Cu(II) complexes. This non-effect was attributed to the strong hydrogen bonding that limits the elasticity of the Cu-O bonds but it is probably due to nickel being misidentified as copper in the refinement.

==Applications==
Copper(II) nitrate finds a variety of applications, the main one being its conversion to copper(II) oxide, which is used as catalyst for a variety of processes in organic chemistry. Its solutions are used in textiles and polishing agents for other metals. Copper nitrates are found in some pyrotechnics. It is often used in school laboratories to demonstrate chemical voltaic cell reactions. It is a component in some ceramic glazes and metal patinas.

===Organic synthesis===
Copper nitrate, in combination with acetic anhydride, is an effective reagent for nitration of aromatic compounds, known as the Menke nitration.
Hydrated copper nitrate adsorbed onto clay affords a reagent called &quot;Claycop&quot;. The resulting blue-colored clay is used as a slurry, for example for the oxidation of thiols to disulfides. Claycop is also used to convert dithioacetals to carbonyls. A related reagent based on montmorillonite has proven useful for the nitration of aromatic compounds.

=== Electrowinning ===
Copper(II) nitrate may also be used for copper electrowinning on small scale with a ammonia (NH3) as a byproduct.

==Naturally occurring copper nitrates==
No mineral of the ideal formula, or the hydrates, are known. Likasite, and buttgenbachite, are related minerals.

 Natural basic copper nitrates include the rare minerals gerhardtite and rouaite, both being polymorphs of . A much more complex, basic, hydrated and chloride-bearing natural salt is buttgenbachite.

<doc id="556264" wikidata="Q205460" url="?curid=556264" title="Cojedes (state)">
<text>Cojedes State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. The state capital is San Carlos.

Cojedes State covers a total surface area of and, in 2011, had a census population of 323,165.

==Etymology==
The name Cojedes, has its origin in the Cariban languages, which means: people of ceramics or people of ceramists. Name that also possesses one of the most important rivers of this federal entity of the plain, (Cojedes River) The same river that is born with the name of Rio Turbio; it passes through Barquisimeto and rises in the northern slope of the Portuguesa mountain range; when it reaches the plain of Barquisimeto it receives the flow of Rio Claro and so goes until it enters the territory of Cojedes, where it is joined by the Tucuragua and the Nirgua.

==History==

===Spanish colonization of Cojedes===
The historical background of the state dates back to the mid-18th century. The city of San Carlos was founded in 1760 by the missionaries Fray Gabriel de San Lucas and Fray Salvador de Cadiz, with the name of San Carlos de Austria. By Royal Decree, dated in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, on September 28, 1676, King Charles II of Spain approved the formation of &quot;Towns of Spaniards for the protection of Indians&quot;, ordering &quot;that near the populated Missions and that from now on &quot;Towns of Spaniards&quot; be populated and founded up to 30 or 40 neighbours, of good life and example to serve to restrain in their escapes, to hold in their drunkenness and to suppress in their riots the Indians, and to accompany the said Spaniards to the missionaries for the reduction of the Gentile Indians&quot;.

By that same Royal Decree, the Missionaries of the Province of Caracas were granted the pertinent attributions to found a Spanish village on the banks of the Tirgua River, which would serve as a permanent seat and refuge for the Indians who were gathered in the Missions and nearby towns, with the aim of imposing them in community life.

By virtue of this order, the Capuchin friar Pedro de Berja, founded on June 7, 1678, the city of &quot;San Carlos de Austria&quot;, on the banks of the Tirgua River, near the Indian village of San Francisco, &quot;with a lot of work to be done because this region was very depopulated, since from Valencia to Barquisimeto it was calculated 60 leagues and 70 from Valencia to Guanare, and the whole territory was deserted&quot;.

Other important towns founded by that time were El Pao (1661); Nuestra Señora de la Chiquinquirá de El Tinaco, founded by Fray Pablo de Orichuela (1760); Santa Clara de Caramacate, by Fray Cirilo Bautista de Sevilla (1750), which were under the jurisdiction and administration of the Province of Caracas, with the category of Cantons.

===19th century===
The current territory of Cojedes was part of the province of Carabobo until March 3, 1855, when the Legislative Assembly created the province of Cojedes with capital in San Carlos, with the cantons of San Carlos, Tinaco and Pao.

The assassination of General Ezequiel Zamora, on January 10, 1860, occurred in front of the San Juan Church, where a stray bullet took his life. Around this fact there is a file of official documents that rest in the Miraflores Historical Archive under the title &quot;The Historical Truth about the death and burial of General Ezequiel Zamora&quot; prepared personally by the then Provisional President of Venezuela, General Cipriano Castro, who dedicated it to the National Academy of History (1904). The story of General Castro is accompanied by a series of testimonies of people who even accompanied General Zamora at the time of his death and later in the various burials.

On March 28, 1864, Cojedes ceased to be a province and became one of the founding states of the United States of Venezuela, to comply with the provisions of the federal Constitution in force for that year.6 In 1866 it merged with Carabobo into a single territorial entity, thus lasting until 1872 when they separated again.

In 1879, it became part of the State of the South, which also included Carabobo, Portuguesa, Zamora and the Nirgua department of the State of Yaracuy.

===20th century===
In 1901 it regained its statehood, however this was lost in 1904 when it became part of the state of Zamora, until August 4, 1909, when it acquired its autonomy again.
In 1989 the first direct universal and secret regional elections for governor were held and the then called Cojedes State Legislative Assembly.

==Geography==
Cojedes State is located in the central-western part of the country and owes its name to the river of the same name, which means &quot;where everything happens&quot;. It has a territorial extension of 14,800 square kilometers, which represents 1.62% of the national territory. It is the fifteenth largest in the country. Its climate is warm.

It belongs to the geographical system of the Central Plains together with the state of Guárico.

===Vegetation===
It is made up of large extensions of plains populated by forests and savannahs that dominate the landscape, where there are also extensive herds of cattle, one of the main economic resources of the state.

The regional tree is the apamate, which is one of the most beautiful, useful and most cultivated trees of the Venezuelan flora. In some regions of the country it is also known as &quot;roble colorado&quot; (Zulia) and &quot;orumo&quot; (Falcón). This tree can measure up to 30 m and its habitat is the deciduous forest.

The state of Cojedes borders on the following states:

*To the north with the states Yaracuy, Carabobo and Lara.
*To the east with the State of Guarico.
*To the south with the State of Barinas.
*To the west with the states of Portuguesa and Lara

===Flora===
It is made up of the relevant natural attractions such as deciduous and semi-deciduous forests. There are clusiaceae, mimosaceae, myrtaceae and tiliaceae in the tree stratum. On the other hand, the palm occupies large extensions of the understory.

===Fauna===
Among the mammals that can be found in the territory of the state are the howler and capuchin monkeys, the cunaguaro, the jaguar and the tapir. Snakes such as boa, rattlesnake, and coral, among others, can be found. You can also find birds such as the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), several species of parakeets and parrots, herons, pigeons, doves, and more.
===Hydrography===

<text>Delta Amacuro State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela, and is the location of the Orinoco Delta. The Paria Gulf and the Atlantic Ocean are found to the north, Bolívar State is found to the south, the Atlantic Ocean and Guyana are found to the east, and Monagas State is found to the west. The state capital city is Tucupita.

Delta Amacuro State covers a total surface area of and, in 2011, had a census population of 171,413.

==History==
=== Pre-Colonial Period ===
Based on theories, anthropological evidence and oral tradition, the antecedents of human activity within this territory date from the time of the first displacements through America; Groups from the eastern slopes of the Peruvian Andes were introduced into the Lower Orinoco, they are called Kotoch or Chavinses; They developed knowledge of pottery (of which formal and technical reminiscences in ceramics are kept), and horticulture.

With time other groups established themselves in its surface, the oral Tradition stands out among them the Barrancas, who through the cultivation of the bitter yucca reached a remarkable economic development and social structure, even with agricultural surpluses that could have stimulated some type of commerce through the monopoly of its production. The expansion of this and other tribes could date back to the beginning of the first millennium, reaching the northeast coast, a large part of the central coast and the Lesser Antilles by the end of this one.

The most recent archaeological evidence of pre-Columbian human activity is attributed to the Warao Ethnic Group, according to verbally documented stories; its members joined as deserters from other hostile tribes, probably being displaced from the north of Brazil or the Eastern Savannah; currently some inhabitants of the state continue to identify themselves as part of this tribe and are a legally recognized group within its demography. They were originally fishermen, hunters and gatherers, but later became farmers with the introduction of the Chinese Ocumo from the island of Trinidad and Guyana.

The Warao people have lived in this region since well before the Europeans arrived in America. Thanks to the remoteness of the Delta, the Warao managed to keep a certain independence from the European and later criollo colonizers.

===Spanish Colonization===

Christopher Columbus arrived at the coast off the Delta on 1 August 1498 during his third voyage to America. He wrote about the macareo, the noise that occurs when a large river flow (the Orinoco river) meets the ocean currents.

As the Delta connects to the Orinoco, it became the point of entry from the Ocean to Guayana. 
His first recognition was by Alonso de Ojeda, in 1499 he documented the mouth of the Orinoco River. Vicente Yañez Pinzón in 1500 discovered the Delta and Diego de Ordaz, commander of the Order of Santiago, captain of Hernán Cortés, in 1532 climbed the Orinoco to the confluence with the Meta River.
The first documented naval expedition from this region occurred in June 1531 (38 years after the Discovery of America) by Diego de Ordaz, who decided to explore the Orinoco with several ships.3 Antonio Berrío entered the region in the 1580s. Beginning in 1598, Fernando de Berrío, Antonio Berrío&#x27;s son, explored the region in his search for El Dorado. Later, Walter Raleigh explored the area in 1594, 1595 and finally on his last expedition in 1616.

The Delta as a region was part of Nueva Andalucía from 1568. It was the entry point for ships to the Orinoco.

The first religious mission was the Jesuit order which was founded in 1682. From this order, Father Gumilla dedicated himself, among other things, to documenting in detail the Warao culture from 1791 onwards. During this century, several governors, both Spanish and English (from Trinidad) tried to join the Warao and structure them into populations, which caused their desertion to the territories of Suriname.

Raleigh referred to the Tivativa as the inhabitants of that region.4 He said they were divided into two tribes, the Ciawani and the Waraweete.

Raleigh wrote: &quot;they never eat anything that is sown or grown, and since in their homes they do not plant or raise anything, when they go to other places they refuse to eat anything that is not provided by nature without labor. They use the tops of palm trees as bread; and they kill deer, fish and pigs to supplement their diet. They also have many types of fruits that grow in the forests and a large number of birds.&quot;

Alexander von Humboldt documented in his Journeys to the Equatorial Regions that the Waraos were the only indigenous people still outside the control of the Colony. He mentioned that by 1799 some estimated their population at 6,000-7,000 people, although he believed it should be less. Humboldt said that the Guaiqueris considered their language to be related to Warao.

===Independent Venezuela===
The territory became part of the Guayana Province when Venezuela became independent.

====19th century====

The settlement of non-indigenous people began in 1848 when Julián Flores, Juan Millán, Tomás Rodríguez, Regino Suiva and others founded the Forty-Eight Settlement, which is the predecessor of the present Tucupita. Later, farmers and merchants continued to settle, mostly from Margarita Island and the states of Sucre and Monagas.

Before 1884, this region was part of the Department of Zea, within the State of Guayana, which was divided in 1884.

On February 27, 1884, the delimitation of the Delta Federal Territory was constitutionally established with an area of 63,667 km2, formed by the districts of Manoa and Guzmán Blanco, with Pedernales as its capital.

On October 21, 1893, the entity disappeared from the federal map, after being annexed to the state of Bolivar during international tensions with the United Kingdom over the area of the Delta claimed by British Guiana.

On October 3, 1899, through the Arbitration Award of Paris and the representation of the United States based on the Monroe Doctrine, the government of Ignacio Andrade lost to the United Kingdom 23,467 km2 of this region, which was annexed to British Guiana.

====20th Century====
On April 26, 1901, it was restored under the name of Territorio Federal Delta Amacuro, composed of the districts of Barima and Tucupita. After this year its political division varied from districts and departments to municipalities. Its capital was moved to Tucupita, a city formerly known as Cuarenta y Ocho.
During this time, multiple religious orders of Catholic affinity made their way into the region. In 1925 a new Catholic religious order, called Capuchinos del Caroní, -whose mission at that time included the Delta Amacuro Territory- founded the first of the current missions,

The Catholic missionary Barral settled in the area in the 1930s and established a mission in Guayo. In the following decades he collected information on the Warao language and published a Spanish-Warao dictionary.

From 1932 onwards, other missionaries founded new missions in San José de Tucupita, San Francisco de Guayo, Nabasanuka and Ajotejana. In 1940 the Organic Law of the Federal Territory Delta Amacuro was promulgated, which divided it into the departments of Tucupita, Pedernales and Antonio Díaz. According to the Extraordinary Official Gazette No. 4,295 of August 3, 1991, the Special Law was promulgated, giving the Territory the status of State, with the same political-territorial division as before.

On January 25, 1995, the State Legislative Assembly issued its second Law of Political Territorial Division, with the 4 current municipalities; it also annexes to the state the hamlets Nuevo Mundo, Platanal, El Triunfo and El Triunfito, previously under the jurisdiction of the State of Bolivar.

In the last decade, Delta Amacuro has seen an important migration of criollo Venezuelans looking for jobs in the oil sector.

==Geography==

The state of Delta Amacuro has an extension of 40,200 kilometers, which represents a little more than 4.6% of the national territory of Venezuela. It is strategically important because it is one of the few territories with direct access to the Atlantic Ocean (most of the Venezuelan coast is made up of waters in the Caribbean Sea or Sea of the Antilles).
The region is located in the extreme east of Venezuela and its main geographical feature is the Orinoco River Delta (the most important and longest in Venezuela) with 18,810 square kilometers and the so-called Serrania del Imataca which has 21390 square kilometers and extends even to the neighboring states of Bolivar and Monagas.

Four types of plant formations can be recognized: Forest mainly of mangrove and with more importance in the forest reserve of the Imataca, Forest mainly in the center of the state, Savannah mainly in the west of the Region and estuary in the eastern part that gives to the Atlantic Ocean. The state has its highest point in the so-called Monte Indira with 687 meters above sea level which contrasts with its lowest point in the sector of Casacoima with -48 meters above sea level.
===Hydrography and islands===
The Orinoco Delta region is crossed by a multitude of rivers and streams with numerous islands including Barril Island, Borojo Island, Bongo Island, Burojoida Island, Baroco Sanuca Island, Corosimo Island, Capure Island, Caneima Island, Coboima Island, Cocuina Island, Curiapo Island, Guasi Borujo Island, Janejo Island, Jebu Cebenoco Island, Mánamo Island, Mono Island, Burojo, Cotorra, Isla de Plata, Tortola Island, Tucupita Island, Macareo, Manamito, Guara, El Cidral or Cangrejo Island, El Barco Island, Morocoto Island, Isla del Medio, Guaranoco Island, Las Islitas Island, Mysterious Island, Noina Island, Guasina Island, Sacupana Island, Tobejuba (Tobajuba) Island, Tobeima Island, Corocoro Island, Cocuina Island, Pedernales Island, Pagayos Island, Caneima Island, Remolinos Island and Remediadora Island.

====Main rivers====
*Orinoco River: one of the most important rivers in South America. The name of the river comes from the Otomaco Orinucu. In the Delta Amacuro the river reaches 200 km in length, in the part where the river flows into the Gulf of Paria and the Atlantic, forming a large delta branched into hundreds of branches, called caños, which cover an area of rainforest and swamp forests of between 22 500-41 000 km2 and 370 km at its widest point. In the rainy season, the Orinoco can increase to a width of 22 km and a depth of 100 m. The alluvial plain region north of the river, whose altitude does not exceed 100 m, is flooded during this rainy season, leaving intertropical savannah grasslands for the rest of the year.
*Barima River flows directly into the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the Orinoco River in (Venezuela), and is therefore sometimes considered part of the Orinoco basin.
*Yocoima River, a short river with a length of approximately 75 km, located in the municipalities of Piar and Caroní in the north of the state of Bolivar, where it forms the northern border of this federal entity with the Amacuro Delta.

===Climate===
Its climate is affected by the proximity to the coast and the rivers that cross it being mostly tropical rainy in the continental or internal zone but of Savannah when approaching the coast. The whole region has heavy rainfall most of the year, but it decreases in the western part of the state.

==Demography==

The population of the region went from only 5,766 inhabitants in 1873 to 33,648 in 1950 when it was still a federal territory. At the beginning of 1990, when it was preparing to become a state of Venezuela, it had 84,564 inhabitants, with the population estimated at 197,200 by 2017. The state is home to most of the Warao ethnic group. According to the INE census of indigenous communities, there were some 26,080 indigenous people, mainly Waraos, in the state by 2001. The Warao maintain their language, although bilingualism is becoming more widespread. The population in the main cities is composed mostly of other Venezuelans.
=== Race and ethnicity ===

According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:

====Languages====
According to article 13 of the constitution of the State of Delta Amacuro of 2015 the official language of the State is Spanish but in recognition of the multiethnic and pluricultural condition of the region, the indigenous languages of the State are also official, highlighting in this article the fundamental use of the Warao language. According to article 14 of the same legal text, education in the state will be given in Spanish, but in the indigenous communities it will be accompanied by the respective local language, taking into account the indigenous educators to guarantee a bilingual education.

<text>Falcón State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. The state capital is Coro.

The state was named after Juan Crisóstomo Falcón.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Present day Falcón State was first explored in 1499 by Juan de la Cosa and Américo Vespucio, as part of an expedition supervised by Alonso de Ojeda. In 1527, the city of Coro was founded by Juan Ampíes, who named it &quot;Santa Ana de Coro&quot;.
In 1811, when Venezuela declared its independence from Spain, Coro remained faithful to the Spanish Crown and was merged with the Province of Maracaibo. In 1815, King Fernando VII created the Province of Coro. In 1821, the province was liberated from Spain by Josefa Camejo during the Venezuelan War of Independence. The area then became a province of the department of Zulia of the Republic of Gran Colombia. In 1830, with the separation of Venezuela from Gran Colombia, the Falcón area became a separate province of that nation.

By 1856, the province contained the cantons of Coro, San Luis, Casigua, Costa Arriba, Cumarebo and the Paraguaná Peninsula. In 1859, after the Federal War began on 20 February in Coro, the area was declared the Independent State of Coro. In 1864, it became a federal state, part of the United States of Venezuela.

=== Falcón State ===
In 1872 the province was renamed Falcón State, in honor of the Federal War leader Juan Crisóstomo Falcón. In 1879, along with Lara and Yaracuy, minus the Department of Nirgua, it became part of the Western Northern State. Between 1881 and 1890 is formed, with Zulia, the state of Falcón-Zulia.

In 1891 Falcón was reestablished as a separate state. In 1899 its name changed, and for a short period of time, it retook its historical denomination of Estado Coro; returning in 1901 to tFalcón .

In 1899, the territory comprising the towns of Tucacas and Chichiriviche, was annexed by Falcón. Lara State received the municipality of Urdaneta.

Coro, the capital, founded with the name of Santa Ana de Coro, was declared National Monument in 1950, and UNESCO has named it Cultural Patrimony of the Humanity in 1993.

==Geography==
Falcón State is located in the north of the Corian System. To the south, Falcón contains medium-altitude mountain ranges configured from east to west, which in the eastern part of the state reach the Caribbean Sea, forming maritime valleys.

West from the city of Coro, a coastal plain runs parallel to the Gulf of Venezuela. To the north lies one of the most characteristic geographic features of the Venezuelan coast: the Paraguana Peninsula, linked to the mainland by the isthmus of Médanos de Coro National Park.
===Climate===
A hot arid climate (&quot;BWh&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification) of very low rainfall dominates the western coast and the Paraguaná Peninsula. Coro receives of rain per year, which frequently fails in dry years, with an average temperature of , while in Punto Fijo there is just of annual rainfall with average temperatures of .

The extremely dry, desert conditions, with rainfall of less than , are recognized on the western coasts of Coro and above all on the isthmus of Los Médanos de Coro, with average annual temperatures of between . In the eastern coastal sectors, rainfall increases from per year, always with high temperatures. Somewhat more favourable, with temperatures between , are the climatic conditions of the mountainous foothills, recognizing a sub-humid climate in the higher altitudes of the Sierras de San Luis and Churuguara, with an annual rainfall of and average temperatures of . On 29 April 2015, Coro recorded a temperature of , which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Venezuela.
===Soils===
On the coastline the soils are calcareous, and between the Lara and Falcón mountains, they are clay. They vary in quality, but in general, the availability of land for traditional agriculture can be classified as low, with 89% of very low potential, 3% of low potential and 6% of moderate potential.

Only 2% of it is located in the southeast valleys and alluvial areas, basins with very high potential. The limitations of the arid and semi-arid soils come from salinity, dryness caused by low rainfall, low concentration of organic matter and the influence of climatic agents such as wind.

===Relief===
The Corian System of Falcon State presents a diversity of landscapes ranging from coastal plains on its Caribbean side to mountain ranges formed by valleys and hills, in an area of transition between the two major mountain systems of the country. The Sierra de San Luis have the highest altitude of the entire system, but are of very modest height; the highest does not exceed 1600 meters ().

Cerro Santa Ana is another natural landmark, located in the center of the Paraguaná peninsula. Unlike the rest of the peninsula, the characteristics of Santa Ana Hill are the contrast between its greenness and the xerophytic vegetation of the Paraguaná area. It has three peaks: the Santa Ana (the highest, that ascends to about 830 meters above sea level), the Buena Vista and Moruy.

===Hydrography===

The state&#x27;s hydrography is very poor. All the rivers flow north, either into the Caribbean Sea or the Gulf of Venezuela. However, the main Venezuelan river of the Caribbean basin, the Tocuyo, bathes a large area of the state before flowing into the Caribbean on the east coast of the state after travelling 423 km. Another river worth mentioning that flows into the Caribbean is Rio Aroa, with a length of 130 km. From the basin of the Gulf of Venezuela, the main ones are the Matícora (201 km) and the Mitare with 120 km.

* Main rivers: Tocuyo, Aroa, Güigüe, Hueque, Matícora, Mitare, Pedregal, Remedios, Ricoa, San Luis.
* Lakes: under the San Luis mountain range in the Cueva del Toro, there is an underground lake, the largest known in Venezuela, called &quot;Río Acarite&quot;.

===Flora and fauna===
The Caribbean marine life off the coast is very rich. There is a great diversity of algae on the rocky shores and on the reef bottoms. The rich fishing grounds have been known for centuries; among the species that are caught locally are various shrimp, octopus, squid, mackerel, corocoro, mullet, horse mackerel, lebranche and dogfish.

Other species in the area are endangered and highly protected, such as several types of sea turtle and the critically endangered Orinoco crocodile. The latter inhabits the coastal mangroves of Morrocoy, Cuare Wildlife Refuge, and the isthmus, along with the numerous species of wading and seabirds, such as shearwater, herons, scarlet ibis, gannets and the Caribbean flamingo. Among the many invertebrates, the Hueque scorpion (&quot;[[Tityus falconensis&quot;), named after the region and discovered in the caves of the [[Juan Crisóstomo Falcón National Park]], is found throughout Falcón; the &quot;[[Scolopendra gigantea]]&quot;, which is the largest [[centipede]] in the world, and the vivid greenbottle-blue [[tarantula]] (&quot;[[Greenbottle blue tarantula|Chromatopelma cyaneopubescens]]&quot;), of [[Paraguaná Peninsula|Paraguaná]], are also native to the region.

In the [[cactus]] and spiny forests that encompass the lowlands, plants heavily armed with thorns predominate, such as (Falcón&#x27;s emblematic tree), [[Genisteae|broom]], &quot;yabo&quot;, , &quot;[[Opuntia]]&quot; (also known as &quot;tuna&quot;, e.g. prickly-pear) and &quot;[[Pachycereus pringlei]]&quot; (or &quot;cardones&quot;). Introduced [[Succulent plant|succulents]], such as &quot;[[Aloe vera]]&quot; and [[sisal]] plants, are scattered throughout the region. Fauna in this habitat includes bats, rabbits, foxes, rodents, [[iguana]]s and lizards; among the birds are the [[vermilion cardinal]] and the tropical mockingbird, also known as &quot;paraulata llanera&quot; or &quot;chuchube&quot; ([[Tropical mockingbird|&quot;Mimus gilvus&quot;]]).

On the upper slopes of the mountains, cloud forests dominate, and an enormous variety of ferns and other plants grow. In the [[limestone]] formations of the Sierra, you can find the &quot;[[Oilbird|guácharo]]&quot;, or oilbirds, which live inside the caverns. Also found are the blacksmith&#x27;s bellbird and the [[keel-billed toucan]], and numerous amphibians and reptiles, such as the nibbling turtle, [[Endemism|endemic]] to the mountains of the [[Coro region|Sistema Coriano]].

===Geology===
Early Cretaceous rocks cover the pre-existing sedimentary units in the south, in what is one of the thickest sections in South America. The rounded hills of the Cocodite table are supported by an ancient [[Igneous rock|igneous]]-metromorphic complex and a poorly-metamorphosed Jurassic succession.

To the east of Vela de Coro and Cumarebo, the foothills are supported by outcrops of the young Tertiary, also present to the north of Urumaco, where the stones are rough and darkened by iron oxide; while the plains concentrated in the lower part of the rivers are alluvial.

The arid plain presents quaternary earthquakes, with elevations sustained by rocks from the upper tertiary.

==Politics and government==
As a federal state, it is autonomous and equal in political terms to the other members of the Federation. It organizes its administration and public powers through the Federal Constitution of Falcón State of 2004, issued by the Legislative Council.

===Executive power===

It is composed of the Governor of the State of Falcón and a group of State Secretaries of his confidence appointed and removed by the regional government. The Governor is elected by the people through a direct and secret vote for a period of four years and with the possibility of immediate reelection for equal periods, being in charge of the state administration before the Legislative Council.

The first elected governor of Falcon was Aldo Cermeño of the Social Christian Party ([[Copei]]), who governed between 1989 and 1992. The current state governor is Victor Clark, of the ruling [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] (PSUV) party, elected for the 2017-2021 period.
Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the [[Venezuelan police|National Police]] and the [[Venezuelan National Guard]].

===Legislative power===

The state legislature is the responsibility of the Falcón State Legislative Council. It is a unicameral and autonomous body, elected by the people through direct and secret vote every four years, and maybe re-elected for two consecutive periods, under a system of proportional representation of the population of the state and its municipalities. It has 11 legislators, of whom 3 are list and 8 are nominal.

== Municipalities and municipal seats ==
Falcon State is subdivided into 25 municipalities (&quot;municipios&quot;), listed below with their administrative capitals, areas and populations.


The [[Paraguaná Peninsula]] comprises the municipalities of Carirubana, and Falcón.

== Demographics ==

The population of Falcon State in 2011 was 902,847 inhabitants, while in 2001 there were 763,188 inhabitants. Its population density has risen from 30.8 inhabitants/km2 in 2001 to 36.4 inhabitants/km2 in 2011. Due to the constant growth of urban areas, a decrease in rural life is observed, with the urban population reaching 67.3% of the total state population in 1990. In 2011 it is estimated that the urban population will be around 600,000 inhabitants, distributed in several cities headed by the [[conurbation]] of 228,931 inhabitants formed by the city of Santa Ana de Coro (192,558 inhabitants) and its port La Vela de Coro (36,373 inhabitants); and by the metropolitan area of [[Punto Fijo]], which includes the former fishing villages of [[Las Piedras, Venezuela|Las Piedras]], Carirubana and Punta Cardón, with a population of over 300,000 inhabitants.

Other medium-sized cities structure their respective areas of influence, highlighting [[Puerto Cumarebo]] (22 047 inhabitants), [[Dabajuro]] (15 269 inhabitants), [[Tucacas]] (12 970 inhabitants), [[Churuguara]] (10 800 inhabitants) and Mene de Mauroa (10 302 inhabitants). Moreover, according to the last population census conducted by the National Institute of Statistics in 2011, 55.7% of the population is ethnically recognized as mestizo; 38.9% as Caucasian, concentrated mainly in the city of Punto Fijo; and 4.1% identified themselves as black.

===Agriculture and cattle raising===

The main economic activity in terms of employment is agriculture, with important crops such as coconut, onions, corn, tomatoes, [[watermelon|patilla]], melon, coffee, aloe and [[legume]]s.

The state of Falcón is the largest producer of coconut and [[copra]], goats and goat products. It is the second largest in the production of fish, paprika and vegetables such as onions, and third in bovine milk and melon production. It also has great advantages for the production of dry floor vegetables such as melon, onions, sideburns and tomatoes. Coconuts alone represent approximately 20,000 hectares in cultivation, and there is availability to expand surface area on the eastern coast of Falcón State. Falcón State is one of the main producers of [[aloe vera]] in Venezuela, and the coffee, region has 3500 hectares in cultivation, but with a provision of 12 700 hectares, distributed in the Sierra de Coro in the south of the federal entity.

In the mountains coffee is cultivated, having prestige the productions in the [[Sierra de Falcón|Sierra de San Luis and Sierra de Churuguara]].

On the Eastern Coast, there are important plantations of coconut trees, which have developed an important industry of oil extraction and use of copra. As for livestock, there is an abundance of goats, cattle and, to a lesser extent, pigs.

===Economic activities===
Falcon is the Venezuelan state with the most kilometres of coast, therefore the fishing activity has special dimensions. The annual production is 30,471 tons of fish and seafood, landed in the ports of [[Las Piedras, Venezuela|Las Piedras]], , [[Puerto Cumarebo]], Zazárida, [[Chichiriviche]], and [[La Vela de Coro]], highlighting the industrialization of crustaceans with the presence on the coast of the state of [[shrimp farming|shrimp farms]], as in Boca de Ricoa and at various points of the Paraguaná peninsula.

In Falcón, there are some working oil fields in , Media, Hombre Pintado and Tiguaje and natural gas fields in [[Puerto Cumarebo]] and other nearby areas. However, most oil industry activity is in the [[Paraguaná Refinery Complex|Paraguaná Refining Center]], one of the largest in the world, made up of the Amuay Refining Complex and the Cardón Refinery, both with a capacity of 940,000 barrels of oil per day, which represents 75% of Venezuela&#x27;s total refining capacity. These refineries are fed with crude oil and gas through products coming from the Maracaibo Lake basin. Likewise, a tourist investment free zone has been consolidated in the Paraguaná peninsula.

Falcón also has mineral deposits to generate basic inputs for industries such as ceramics, fertilizers, energy, chemicals, abrasives, metalworking, pharmaceuticals, pottery, and paint, among others. Phosphates are exploited in Riecito and limestone in Chichiriviche, which are processed at the Cumarebo cement plant (Holcim de Venezuela). It also has immense coal deposits in the western zone, with proven reserves for open-pit mining in the order of 20 million metric tons, and reserves estimated at 120 million metric tons, within a radius of action of 50,000 hectares. Other minerals in the area include graphite, silica, limestone, dolomite, phosphate, chromite and marble.

Thanks to the dry and arid climate, there are five natural salt flats and some 220,000 hectares of land suitable for the construction of artificial salt flats spread throughout the Falconian territory. Of all the salt mines, only the Las Cumaraguas salt mine is under industrial exploitation, the rest being exploited by hand.

Also, thanks to its natural landscapes (like the Medanos de Coro and the National Parks Cueva de la Quebrada del Toro, Sierra de San Luis and Morrocoy) tourism is gaining importance in the economy of the State.

==Infrastructure==

The region is mostly coastal lowlands and the northern [[Andes|Andean mountain]] hills, and is mostly dry with limited agriculture production. Farming mostly occurs in river valleys and mountainous areas, and includes maize, [[coconut]], [[sesame]], coffee and [[sugar cane]].

[[Santa Ana de Coro|Coro]], the state capitol and the Paraguaná Peninsula have had significant amounts of industrialization and growth. Large [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] such as the [[Paraguana Refinery Complex]] in the city of [[Punto Fijo]] are located on the southwestern shore of the Paraguaná Peninsula, and approximately two-thirds of Venezuela&#x27;s total oil production occurs in this area, much of which is exported via tanker ships that ship internationally through the port of [[Amuay]].

===Handicrafts===
Falconian craftsmanship is rich in artistic expression. Within the popular handicrafts are the hammocks with unique styles, techniques and values of the state. The craft production is large and varied. The craftsmen of the towns that surround the city of Coro specialize in the manufacture of furniture with the wood of the cardon, the stick of Arch and the curarí. The wood is complemented using vegetable fibres such as [[sisal]] or with cow and goat skins. In Paraguaná the clay is worked to build objects for current domestic use, applying the same techniques used by the Caquetíos Indians. On the eastern coast, the attraction is the basketwork made with bulrush, cocuiza and vines and the hammocks made with thread.

===Gastronomy===
The typical Falconian food allows the enjoyment of a variety of flavors represented in its specialities, such as goat talkarí, , goat milk cheese, custard, peeled arepa and goat milk candy. At a national level, rice with coconut and rice pudding is one of the most popular sweets, especially during the Easter season.
===Folklore===
Folkloric, traditional and religious expressions offer a seal of originality in the state. In typical celebrations, features of African, indigenous and European cultures are associated. Among these celebrations is the Baile de las Turas, which has its origin in an indigenous dance related to the hunting season and the harvesting of the corn crop. It is celebrated in San Pedro, El Tural and Mapararí in the mountain region, between 23 and 24 September. The drum dances in the cities of Coro, La Vela and Puerto Cumarebo are very joyful and colourful, and the celebration of the Day of the Mad (28 December) in La Vela de Coro, with masked parades in the streets and public squares, reaches a display similar to that of the great carnivals of the world.

<text>Guárico State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. The state capital is San Juan de Los Morros and the largest city is Calabozo, other important city centers include Valle de la Pascua and Zaraza. Guárico State covers a total surface area of and, in 2011, had a census population of 747,739. It is named for the Guárico River.
==History==

===Conquest and colony of Spain===
When the Europeans arrived in Venezuela, various ethnic groups inhabited the region that would constitute Guárico. Among these were the Caribs Tamanacos, Palenques and Cumanagotos, as well as groups of Guamos and Otomacos. The latter were in permanent confrontation with the Caribs.

The colonization of the region only began in the 17th century and above all in the 18th century. The cacique Chiparara managed to organize Carib and Otomac groups in the Llanos de Guárico to counter-attack the Spanish colonizing forces.4 After they were defeated, around 1653, the Carib and Otomac groups would retreat southward or lose cohesion and would be gradually assimilated.
Many of the settlers who settled in the area were Basque missionaries and encomenderos who founded Altagracia de Orituco on March 1, 1676. Miguel de Urbés, a lieutenant of Joan Orpí, founded the city of Zaraza in 1645 with the name of San Miguel de la Nueva Tarragona del Batey. El Sombrero was founded in 1720. Four years later they founded Calabozo. In 1728 they established the town of Chaguaramas in a place where there were settlements of cumanagotos. Fray Anselmo Isidro de Ardales established the town of Tucupido in 1760 with groups of cumanagotes and palenques. San Juan de los Morros would be founded much later, around 1780.

Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland passed through the region in March 1800 on their way to the Orinoco and its tributaries.

During the time of Spanish rule, Guarico was part of the Province of Caracas, which belonged to the Captaincy General of Venezuela.

===19th Century===
During the war of independence, several battles took place in the region of Guárico.

The military chief José Tomás Boves defeated Vicente Campo Elías in La Puerta, near San Juan de los Morros, on February 3, 1814. A few months later, in June, the Spanish troops again under the command of Boves defeated the troops of Simón Bolívar and Santiago Mariño on the same battlefield.

On August 2, 1816 the battle of Quebrada Honda near El Socorro took place. The royalists were defeated by the Republican army led by the Scottish adventurer Gregor MacGregor.

The Plains troops led by José Antonio Páez defeated the Royalist forces of Marshal Pablo Morillo on February 12, 1818. However, Morillo was able to defeat the troops of General Simón Bolívar in the third battle of La Puerta.

After independence, Guárico became the scene of numerous battles in the civil wars that plagued the country in the 19th century.

Venezuela entered into a deep crisis from 1842 onwards. In 1846 an uprising took place that was particularly felt in Guárico. Peasants and other poor people complained about social injustice and numerous groups criticized the political situation in which only a few elites held all the power. The protests continued until May 1847.

The creation with the name of Guárico Province dates from 1848 when the province of Caracas was divided into three.

In 1856 Guárico became part of the 21 provinces of Venezuela until 1864 when it was declared an independent state, and an integral part of the United States of Venezuela.

On February 17, 1860, the Battle of Coplé between the federalist and central government troops took place near Calabozo. The battle itself did not give clear results, but the continuation of the guerrilla warfare after this episode led to the signing of a peace agreement on April 23, 1863 between the Federalists and the Government.

In 1879 the state became part of the Gran Estado Miranda with what is now Bolívar (present-day Miranda), Guzmán Blanco (present-day Aragua), Apure and Nueva Esparta. In 1889 this state was renamed Miranda.

On March 11, 1892, the caudillo Joaquín Crespo rose up against the president of that time, Raimundo Andueza Palacio, who had wanted to change the constitution at the beginning of 1892 in order to supposedly govern for two more years. Joaquín Crespo marched from his hacienda in Guárico to Caracas, where he took power.

In 1898, Guárico acquired its autonomy again and in 1899 it was ratified by presidential decree. From this date on, it remained an independent state even though it suffered changes in its territory. Its boundaries with the state of Aragua were established by a protocol signed in 1933.

General Juan Vicente Gómez defeated near San Juan de los Morros the troops of General Luciano Mendoza, who was fighting on the side of the so-called Liberating Revolution against Cipriano Castro.

===20th Century===
Foreign companies began to exploit oil in the Guárico area in 1946. The fields of El Carrizal and El Sombrero began to attract many workers.

In 1957 the construction of the Guárico reservoir began. With 230 km2, it is one of the largest irrigation reservoirs in Venezuela and has been contributing to the development of the country.

==Geography==

Guárico is known as &quot;the gateway&quot; to the Central Plains, with a geography of contrasts between mountainous areas near the border of the state of Cojedes, galleys (because of their hat shape) or hills that accompany the course of the river Guárico and an equally wide area of flat land.

In some parts of the country, this culinary tradition has been diminished for ecological reasons, in order to preserve the species. However, there are still many places where it can be tasted.
===Joropo===
The joropo is sung and danced all over Venezuela. It is not only a danceable expression, but also a party where corridos, galerones, golpes, passages and other folkloric tonalities are sung and danced. It takes place at any time of the year and the motive can be a baptism, birthday or the celebration of a patron saint&#x27;s day. The music of the joropo is played with typical instruments such as cuatro, maracas and harp, which accompany songs and choruses.

The zapateo and escobilleo, which are steps of the joropo, are mixed in the state with typical turns of the region like the remolino, the cuartao and the toriao.

<text>Lara State (, ) is one of the 23 states of Venezuela. Lara is located in the Central-Western Region, Venezuela. The state capital is Barquisimeto. 

Lara State covers a total surface area of and, in 2015, had a census population of 2,019,211.

==Toponymy==
The state is named after a notable hero of Venezuela&#x27;s independence, General Jacinto Lara.
==History==

During the colony and a large part of the independence period, the current territory of Lara belonged to the province of Caracas. In 1824 it was absorbed by the Province of Carabobo, created that year. In 1832, after the disintegration of the Great Colombia, the region was disintegrated; it was then constituted in the Province of Barquisimeto, which included the cantons of Quíbor, El Tocuyo, Carora and Barquisimeto; besides others that conform today the state of Yaracuy. In 1856, through the new law of territorial division, San Felipe and Yaritagua joined Nirgua to form the Province of Yaracuy. It is in these towns, mainly in El Tocuyo and Barquisimeto, where the first lights of Venezuelan Independence were documented, and from which the construction of Venezuela was undertaken with the towns, cities and roads that unite the great part of this territory. It is also worth noting that the cattle that were taken to the Llanos were the Tocuyo cattle.

In 1881, the creation of the Great State of the North of the West was agreed upon, to which the areas of Lara and Yaracuy were added. In August of that same year, the state was given the name Lara, in honor of the patriot General Jacinto Lara. In 1899, the Congress established the autonomy of the 20 states, as contemplated in the 1864 constitution, a division that was confirmed in 1909, through a constitutional reform, which has been maintained until today.

In 1899, the territory corresponding to the current municipalities Silva and Monseñor Iturriza of the state of Falcon were integrated into the latter state in exchange for what today is the municipality Urdaneta.

===Prehistory===

When the Europeans arrived in Venezuela, the region that is now Lara was inhabited by various ethnic groups such as the gayones, ayomanes and coyones. These peoples spoke, according to what anthropologists have been able to reconstruct from Spanish sources, languages of the Jirajarana linguistic family. The valleys of Quíbor, Barquisimeto and El Tocuyo had a relatively high population density and the peoples of the region practiced agriculture.

===Spanish Conquest and Colonization===
The Augsburg Welser expeditions were very destructive for the region. From 1529 to the 1940s the German conquerors carried out massacres of entire villages and tried to enslave the remaining indigenous people. Several of the first permanent populations of Europeans settled here because of the fertility of the region and the availability of indigenous labour. Thus, towns such as El Tocuyo, Quíbor, Cuara and Cubiro were founded.

The Welser administration was in permanent conflict with the interests of the Spaniards, who accused them of failing to carry out the task of colonization, among other things. In 1545, Juan de Carvajal, who lived in Coro, went with several families of colonists to the area of El Tocuyo and there he began to distribute the natives according to the encomienda system. El Tocuyo became one of the most important axes of the Venezuelan economy and also the center of operations of the Spanish conquest in the territory.

During the colony, the current Lara territory belonged to the province of Caracas. The region of El Tocuyo and Barquisimeto had convents that offered education to the inhabitants at a higher level than in other regions of Venezuela.

In the 17th century El Tocuyo developed a school of painting that was in contact with that of Quito. By the 18th century the area of Lara was an important producer of wheat, which was exported to Mexico.

===Independent Venezuela===
In 1824 it was absorbed by the Province of Carabobo, created that year. In 1832, after the disintegration of Gran Colombia, the region was disbanded; it was then constituted in the Province of Barquisimeto, which included the cantons of Quíbor, El Tocuyo, Carora and Barquisimeto; in addition to others that today make up the state of Yaracuy. In 1856, through the new law of territorial division, San Felipe and Yaritagua joined Nirgua to form the Province of Yaracuy. In 1881, it was agreed to create the Great State of the North of the West, to which the areas of Lara and Yaracuy were added. In August of that same year the name of Lara State was assigned in honor of the patriot General Jacinto Lara. In 1899,12 the Congress established the autonomy of the 20 states, as contemplated in the 1864 constitution, a division that was confirmed in 1909, through a constitutional reform, which has been maintained until today.

Until 1899 this state had access to the sea with the populations of Tucacas and Chichiriviche, currently belonging to the state of Falcon. In fact, the population of Tucacas was the main port of export of copper extracted from the mines of Aroa.

==Geography==
It is bordered on the north by Falcon State; on the south by Portuguesa and Trujillo States; on the east by Yaracuy State and on the west by Zulia State.

This state has 19,800 square kilometers (19,800 square miles) which represents 2.15% of the national territory, a territory almost equivalent to the size of Israel.

===Hydrography===

Typical dry and arid landscape of the state in the area of Cerro Saroche National Park.
The waters of the state&#x27;s rivers flow from three different sources: the Caribbean, the Atlantic through the Orinoco River and Lake Maracaibo.

*Main rivers: Amarillo, Auro, Aragua, Curarigua, Morere, Tocuyo, Turbio, Urama, Yacambú.
*Lagoons: Laguna Amarilla, Laguna Cocoy.
*Wine Waterfall in Dinira National Park

===Relief===
Lara&#x27;s topography consist of high plains and low, broken hills, with a relatively hot and dry climate. Lara depression is located at altitudes between 1,600 and 2,600 ft (487 to 792 m). Among the landscapes of moderate height, the pressures of Carora, Barquisimeto and Yaracuy stand out, while the Sierra de Aroa, the Nirgua Massif and the Andean buttress present more broken reliefs. The Barquisimeto high plateau is a privileged place for human settlement, commerce and communications, while the valley of the turbid river allows for intense agricultural use, in contrast to the aridity of the surrounding xerophytic vegetation. It is integrated by the last foothills of the Venezuelan Andes System, located in the south and southwest of the state respectively. The most pronounced altitude in the state is the Cendé Paramo at 3,585 m above sea level.

The Lara-Falcón formation is, from the orographic point of view, the transition between the Coastal and the Andean mountain ranges. It is a different system in which the Coriano system, the Barquisimeto-Carora depression and the Turbio-Yaracuy depression stand out. This depression is located in the northwest of the country, with an approximate extension of 52,000 square kilometers.

===Vegetation===
It is as varied as its relief and climate, although in almost all the territory xerophilous vegetation predominates, represented by cujíes, tunas, espinares and cardonales.

To the south the variety ranges from scrub and bushes to evergreen forests, with woods in mountainous areas. Different plant formations are identified as a result of the combination of the different environmental variables within a tropical space. To the west, in the Carora depression, the forest community is poor with a predominance of sparse and xerophytic thorn trees. In the eastern sector there are deciduous or semi-deciduous primary forests. The cujíes and cardones dominate the central and northern areas, while towards the south and in the mountainous areas the vegetation cover goes from the bushes to the semi-humid forests. The fertility of some valleys allows the cultivation of sugar cane, sisal and fruits.

===Geology===
It presents from mountain areas with geological components of the secondary and tertiary era to extensive plains formed by large alluvial contributions of the Quaternary era, through valley landscapes, formed by sediments of Quaternary origin.
=== Climate ===
Two types of climate prevail in Lara state: Tropical, Mountain, and also dry and very dry, followed by wet mountain. Mountain humid climates are low and humid paramero just 4.8% of estadal area. The dry atmosphere is typical, since evaporation exceeds precipitation, reaching until 650 mm of annual average, with rain falling at different times according to geographycal location..

The average annual temperature fluctuates between 19 °C (66,2 °F) and 29 °C (84,2 °F), with an average of 24 °C (75,2 °F) in the capital, Barquisimeto.

The climate tends to vary between cold moor (in mountainous areas) and semi-arid tropical dry climate (specific in the area of the Lara&#x27;s Depression, where the city of Carora and surrounding populations are located).

In general, the climate tends to vary between cold moorland (in the mountainous areas) and dry semi-arid tropical climate (mainly in the area of the Larense Depression where the city of Carora and surrounding towns are located).

The tropical steppe climate (semi-arid) is located specifically towards the northern part of the states of Zulia and Falcón, the Lara-Falcón depression, the central coastal zone, the coastal areas of the Unare depression and part of the state of Sucre, towards the Gulf of Cariaco, and a large part of the island of Margarita.

===Soils===
About 60% of the land in the west of Lara State is mountainous and presents soils of slow permeability, fine texture, reddish color and commonly acid reaction. They have a low organic matter content and low fertility.

To the southeast of Carora the soils are stony, without a well developed profile, variable permeability, acid reaction, fast runoff and strong erosion. In the area corresponding to the beaches the low permeability, the flooding, the predominant clayey texture and the appreciable content of salts limit their use. Erosion is present throughout the area and the hills near the beaches present a critical physiognomy. In the Barquisimeto Depression, the soils of the flat areas are very variable.
=== Hydrography ===
The waters of the rivers in the state are drained by three aspects:. The Caribbean sea, the Atlantic Ocean, through the Orinoco River and Maracaibo&#x27;s Lake.

Main rivers: Amarillo, Auro, Aragua, Curarigua, Morere, Tocuyo, Turbio, Urama, Yacambú.

Lagoons: Laguna Amarilla, Laguna Cocoy. Wine waterfall in the Dinira National Park
==Politics and Government==
As a state it is autonomous and equal in political terms to its peers, it organizes its administration and public powers through a Constitution of the Lara State, dictated by the Legislative Council.

Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains its own police force, which is supported and complemented by the National Police and the Venezuelan National Guard.

===Executive Power===
It is composed by the Governor of Lara State and a group of State Secretaries of his confidence who are officials of free appointment and removal. The Governor is elected by the people through direct, universal and secret vote for a period of four years and with the possibility of continuous re-election for new periods, being in charge of the state administration. The Governor must render an annual account of his actions before the regional parliament called the Legislative Council of Lara State.

The current governor is Adolfo Pereira Antique of the PSUV. He succeeded Carmen Meléndez, who elected for the 2017–2021 term. 
===Legislative Branch===

Lara, located in the commercial corridors that link the West, the Andes, the center and the east of the country, is an important receiver and distributor of foodstuffs to other regions inside and outside Venezuela (export) through the wholesale market that commercializes a third of the fresh food consumed in the country, Mercabar.

Considered since 1950 to be one of the Venezuelan cities least dependent on oil, agriculture and trade are the main economic activities in the region that contributes: 22% of coffee, 26% of sugar cane, 90% of pineapple, 31% of grapes, 54% of onions, 12% of tomatoes, 54% of paprika, 29% of cabbage, 100% of sisal and 22% of potatoes.

However, today only around 25 thousand hectares are irrigated due to the lack of water, which could change radically with the completion of the Yacambú hydraulic project and the hydraulic works for the Urdaneta and Torres municipalities, infrastructures that would provide around 60 hectares of arable land in the central north of the state.

From the industrial point of view, in the state of Lara this type of activity is concentrated in the city of Barquisimeto, which has industrial zones of important magnitude and production capacity.

Important administrative and public service activities are concentrated in the state metropolis of Barquisimeto, together with all kinds of commerce, banking and financial entities, due to its strategic location on the road network in the West of the country, and with its railway connection to Puerto Cabello and Acarigua. Equally important are the position as the hub of transport and storage companies. In addition, there are metal-mechanic, agri-industrial and textile industrial establishments, both in the city and in its immediate surroundings, such as cement plants, sugar mills, milk processing plants and others.

===Agriculture===
Of special relevance are the agricultural activities, especially the cultivation of sugar cane in the valleys of the rivers Tocuyo, Turbio and various regions; of specialized horticulture of onions, peppers and tomatoes in Quibor; of viticulture in Carora and El Tocuyo; of sisal and coconutcommerce between the central and western parts of Venezuela. It also serves as the centre of a large agricultural area that produces sisal, cacao, cattle, sugarcane, and coffee, as well as subsistence crops, along with pineapple, in the dry areas. In the highlands, coffee, potatoes and vegetables thrive. Important are the cattle activities, as much of the modern milk cattle ranch, like of the traditional cattle ranch of goats. Various types of tourism are taking on increasing significance, with emphasis on the expansion of the rich Larense craftsmanship in places like Guadalupe and Tintorero.

===Natural resources===
The state has metallic and non-metallic minerals, especially red and white clays, silica sands, gravels, iron, mercury, pyrrhophyllites, and various types of limestone. Among the forest resources are cuji, jabillo, jobo, olive, vera and semeruco.

The rivers, reservoirs and thermal water sources such as the dams of Dos Cerritos, Yacambú, Atarigua, Arenales, and the San Miguel Volcano provide hydraulic and geothermal potential.

The Culture of the region is very rich, it is a seat for multitudinous celebrations, such as The International Carnivals of Barquisimeto (Month of February–March), where you can see a great variety of floats, and artistic musical shows of recognized trajectory, The International Fair of Barquisimeto which begins on September 14 (anniversary of the founding of Barquisimeto), and culminates on September 25 each year, where you can see, among many things, various exhibitions and musical shows, and finally, a wide range of options to enjoy Christmas in Barquisimeto, where you can see various exhibitions, musical shows and many fireworks. It is customary to receive the New Year at La Flor de Venezuela, with family and friends. Around Barquisimeto and due to migration also in the city are practiced &quot;Los Tamunangues&quot; or devotional festivities to San Antonio de Padua, as payment of promises to favors received. The festivity has its origins in the Andes Larenses (Sanare-El Tocuyo) and is celebrated every June 13; but a Tamunangue can be held at any time of the year. Master Luis Felipe Ramón y Rivera explains that the name &quot;Tamunangue&quot; derives from the name given to the drum used in the interpretation of the characteristic songs of this dance, the tamunango.

The Divine Shepherdess is an important religious icon in Venezuela. She is the spiritual patron of the city and is one of the Marian invocations with many followers in the region. Every January 14 a multitudinous procession is held in which this image is carried from Santa Rosa to the Cathedral of Barquisimeto. More than two and a half million people have been counted,29 which would make it the second most important Marian procession in the world.

<text>The Symphony No. 5 in D minor, Op. 47, by Dmitri Shostakovich is a work for orchestra composed between April and July 1937. Its first performance was on November 21, 1937, in Leningrad by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under Yevgeny Mravinsky. The premiere was a &quot;triumphal success&quot; that appealed to both the public and official critics, receiving an ovation that lasted well over half an hour.

==Instrumentation==
The work is scored for two flutes and piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets and E clarinet, two bassoons and contrabassoon, four horns, three B trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, triangle, cymbals, bass drum, tam-tam, glockenspiel, xylophone, two harps (one part), piano, celesta and strings.

== Form ==
=== First movement: Moderato ===
&lt;score sound=&quot;2&quot;&gt;

\relative c {
\set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;violin&quot;

\tempo &quot;Moderato&quot; \tempo 8 = 76

&lt;/score&gt;

The first movement, in D minor, is in sonata form. The exposition opens with a &quot;strenuous&quot; string figure in canon of rising and falling minor sixths that quickly narrow to minor thirds.

The opening&#x27;s dotted rhythm persists as a lyrical first theme is played by the first violins. This theme presents itself as a descending five-tone motif in bars 6-7, but Shostakovich had already used it in the second movement of his fourth symphony (bars 318-321), which was recognized there as a quotation from Gustav Mahler&#x27;s song &quot;Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt&quot;, from &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;; specifically, the line &quot;He goes to the rivers and preaches to the fishes&quot;. In its original appearance, this Mahler quotation is juxtaposed with musical notation in the shape of a nose (on page 122 of the Sikorski score), the notes in the &quot;nose&quot; being a quotation from &quot;The Internationale&quot;, which was also previously hidden in bars 25-30 of the first movement of the 4th symphony, with the effect of depicting the futility of the socialist &quot;sermon&quot;.

For the appearance of this quotation in the fifth symphony, the five-tone Mahler motif occurs in a total of 15 variants in the first and third movements, and bears witness to the Shostakovich&#x27;s secret triumph in being able to describe the party doctrine that had silenced his earlier work as a completely useless sermon. This provocative insight is therefore part of Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;creative response of a Soviet artist to justified criticism&quot;. However, since the fourth symphony had been withdrawn before the premiere in 1936 and could only be presented to the public 25 years later, the extramusical context was lost when the 5th symphony was premiered in Leningrad. Only later has this connection between the fourth and fifth symphonies, which undermines the demands of &quot;socialist realism&quot;, been uncovered.

The first theme is repeated several times in combination with the opening motif, and greatly varied with new demarcations and penetrations. There is a great deal of variation and linking of all elements, giving the impression of a single continuous process.

&lt;/score&gt;

The secondary theme (mm. 50-120) in E minor offers the greatest possible contrast to the main theme. The tempo is more fluid, and the sustained tones of the secondary theme are linked by wide intervals: octaves, fourths, sevenths instead of the dominant seconds found in the first theme. Simplicity prevails over complexity, as the far-reaching lyrical melody is accompanied by chords in a continuous, slightly lively rhythm.

An accompanying figure takes the lead at the beginning of the powerful development. Only now does the tempo of this movement reach Allegro. Themes from the exposition appear in augmentation and diminution in contrapuntal conflicts with themselves. The thematic material is transformed into a grotesquely distorted quick march in a wide development with military drums and trumpets. After several false starts, from m. 157 the second theme intervenes in the action.

In the recapitulation, which is heavily reduced compared to the exposition, themes heard earlier on are brought back again either identically or somewhat varied. Near the end of the movement, the second subject is heard again in the form of a canon played by flute and horn, then the same material is played by the violin and piccolo. The movement ends with the celesta playing a rising figure, and slowly fading away.

In general, the inner drama of the first movement can be described as an interplay between lamentation and mourning, contrasting with a &quot;departure for battle&quot; which reaches its climax with the entry of the recapitulation. In the end, the outcome of this conflict proves to be ambiguous, and the looming threats have not yet been resolved.

=== Second movement: Allegretto ===
&lt;score sound=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
\new staff
\relative c {
\set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;cello&quot;

&lt;/score&gt;

The second movement is in a ternary scherzo form, or minuet and trio form, in A minor, but it more closely resembles a ländler than either a minuet or a scherzo.

The first section and its reprise consist of a rather loose and varied sequence of ländler melodies. The movement opens with a heavy, loud introduction in the cellos and basses, followed by a softer solo on the E clarinet and the french horn, later oboes, and finally strings. At the end of this development, the ländler becomes grotesque and bloated.

The trio has a peculiar harmony. Degrees I and VII alternate in the basic position, so that parallel fifths constantly arise. The effect does not sound like folk music, but rather like &quot;run-down&quot; music.

In the recapitulation, some of the material heard earlier is repeated piano and staccato, not loudly and sustained as at the start.

The movement closes in A minor with four canonically enriched fortissimo bars. Overall, the scherzo lacks innocence and humor; closer listening assures that the peace is not to be trusted, considering the numerous unusual modulations and occasional discords.

=== Third movement: Largo ===
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\new staff
\relative c {
\set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;oboe&quot;
\key fis \minor
\time 4/4
\tempo &quot;Largo&quot; \tempo 4 = 50
\partial 8(^ &quot;I solo&quot;) c8 (g2 f4) r8 c&#x27; (as2 g4) r r c (bes g f8 g as4 d,2) 
&lt;/score&gt;
Shostakovich begins this movement with F minor violins in three sections, rather than the more usual two. The opening theme is played by the third violins. Second and first violins are slowly added and continue the melody. After the assertive trumpets of the first movement and the raucous horns of the second, this movement uses no brass at all, so there is a limited palette of sounds. This section yields to a pair of flutes in widely-separated counterpoint, the second of which makes reference to the first subject of the first movement. The solo is then passed on to the oboe with string accompaniment. The third movement ends like the first, with a celesta solo that slowly fades away. The strings are divided throughout the entire movement (3 groups of violins, violas in 2, cellos in 2; basses in 2).

This movement is a culmination of resignation, mourning and lamentation, which in the center of the movement increases to a passionate accusation with clarinet, xylophone and piano. Otherwise the movement is more chamber music-like and carried by the string orchestra. The tonality is floating and often not definable, free-floating and independent linearity of the individual voices prevails.

=== Fourth movement: Allegro non troppo ===
&lt;score sound=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
\new staff
\relative c&#x27; {
\set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;trumpet&quot;
\clef treble
\key d \minor

\partial 8 a8-&gt; d4-&gt; e-&gt; f4.-&gt; e16 f g8 bes f&#x27;8. 16 e8 g c,4
&lt;/score&gt;
The D minor finale, also in sonata form, differs greatly from its predecessors, mostly with regard to melodic structure and motives. Various themes from earlier in the work are expanded until we get to a new theme played on the trumpet. This new theme is passed on to the strings and eventually the piece becomes quieter. The development section is much quieter and more tranquil, and is ultimately replaced by a march, where the melodies from earlier are played like a funeral dirge, accompanied by timpani. The music builds as the new accompaniment passes from timpani to woodwinds and then to strings, finally reaching a point where the piece changes from a minor key into a major key.

==Overview==
===Composition===
The Symphony quotes Shostakovich&#x27;s song &quot;Vozrozhdenije&quot; (Op. 46 No. 1, composed in 1936–37), most notably in the last movement; the song is a setting of a poem by Alexander Pushkin (find text and a translation here) that deals with the matter of rebirth. This song is by some considered to be a vital clue to the interpretation and understanding of the whole symphony. In addition, commentators have noted that Shostakovich incorporated a motif from the &quot;Habanera&quot; from Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; into the first movement, a reference to Shostakovich&#x27;s earlier infatuation with Elena Konstantinovskaya, who refused his offer of marriage; she subsequently moved to Spain and married the photographer and film director Roman Karmen.

===Reception===
With the Fifth Symphony, Shostakovich gained an unprecedented triumph, with the music appealing equally—and remarkably—to both the public and official critics, though the overwhelming public response to the work initially aroused suspicions among certain officials. The then-head of the Leningrad Philharmonic, Mikhail Chulaki, recalls that certain authorities bristled at Mravinsky&#x27;s gesture of lifting the score above his head to the cheering audience, and a subsequent performance was attended by two plainly hostile officials, V. N. Surin and Boris M. Yarustovsky, who tried to claim in the face of the vociferous ovation given the symphony that the audience was made up of &quot;hand-picked&quot; Shostakovich supporters. Yet the authorities in due course claimed that they found everything they had demanded of Shostakovich restored in the symphony. Meanwhile, the public heard it as an expression of the suffering to which it had been subjected by Stalin. The same work was essentially received two different ways.

====Official====
An article by the composer appeared in the newspaper &quot;Vechernyaya Moskva&quot; on January 25, 1938, a few days before the Moscow premiere of the Fifth Symphony:

Among the reviews, which often analyzed the work in thorough detail, one that particularly delighted me stated that the Fifth Symphony was a Soviet artist&#x27;s no-nonsense response to fair criticism. 

Official critics treated the symphony as a turnaround in its composer&#x27;s career. Like the &quot;Pravda&quot; attack at that time on the opera &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot;, the political basis for extolling the Fifth Symphony was to show how the Party could make artists bow to its demands.

The official tone toward the Fifth Symphony was further set by a review by Alexei Tolstoy, who likened the symphony to the literary model of the Soviet Bildungsroman describing &quot;the formation of a personality&quot;—in other words, of a Soviet personality. In the first movement, the composer-hero suffers a psychological crisis giving rise to a burst of energy. The second movement provides respite. In the third movement, the personality begins to form: &quot;Here the personality submerges itself in the great epoch that surrounds it, and begins to resonate with the epoch.&quot; With the finale, Tolstoy wrote, came victory, &quot;an enormous optimistic lift&quot;. As for the ecstatic reaction of the audience to the work, Tolstoy claimed it showed Shostakovich&#x27;s &quot;perestroyka&quot; to be sincere. &quot;Our audience is organically incapable of accepting decadent, gloomy, pessimistic art. Our audience responds enthusiastically to all that is bright, clear, joyous, optimistic, life-affirming.&quot;

Not everyone agreed with Tolstoy, even after another article reportedly by the composer echoed Tolstoy&#x27;s views. Boris Asafyev wrote, &quot;This unsettled, sensitive, evocative music which inspires such gigantic conflict comes across as a true account of the problems facing modern man—not one individual or several, but mankind.&quot;

====Public====
During the first performance of the symphony, people were reported to have wept during the &quot;Largo&quot; movement. The music, steeped in an atmosphere of mourning, contained echoes of the , the Russian Orthodox requiem. It also recalled a genre of Russian symphonic works written in memory of the dead, including pieces by Glazunov, Steinberg, Rimsky-Korsakov and Stravinsky.

=== Symphony as artistic salvation ===
After the symphony had been performed in Moscow, Heinrich Neuhaus called the work &quot;deep, meaningful, gripping music, classical in the integrity of its conception, perfect in form and the mastery of orchestral writing—music striking for its novelty and originality, but at the same time somehow hauntingly familiar, so truly and sincerely does it recount human feelings&quot;.

Shostakovich returned to the traditional four-movement form and a normal-sized orchestra. More tellingly, he organized each movement along clear lines, having concluded that a symphony cannot be a viable work without firm architecture. The harmonic idiom in the Fifth is less astringent, more tonal than previously, and the thematic material is more accessible. It has been said that, in the Fifth Symphony, the best qualities of Shostakovich&#x27;s music, such as meditation, humor and grandeur, blend in perfect balance and self-fulfillment.

===Post-&quot;Testimony&quot; response===
The final movement is declared in &quot;Testimony&quot; to be a &quot;parody&quot; of shrillness, representing &quot;forced rejoicing&quot;. In the words attributed to the composer in &quot;Testimony&quot; (a work which has had its authenticity questioned):

The rejoicing is forced, created under threat, as in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;. It&#x27;s as if someone were beating you with a stick and saying, &quot;Your business is rejoicing, your business is rejoicing&quot;, and you rise, shaky, and go marching off, muttering, &quot;Our business is rejoicing, our business is rejoicing.&quot;

The Fifth is one of Shostakovich&#x27;s most played symphonies.

<text>The [[Pulitzer Prize]]s for 2004 were announced on April 5, 2004.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; won five journalism awards, the most that the newspaper has ever won in a single year and second only to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2002 for the most won in a year by any paper.

==Journalism awards==

* Beat Reporting: 
**Daniel Golden, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, for his compelling and meticulously documented stories on admission preferences given to the children of alumni and donors at American universities.
* Breaking News Reporting: 
**Staff of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, for its compelling and comprehensive coverage of the massive wildfires that imperiled a populated region of southern California.
* Breaking News Photography: 
**David Leeson and Cheryl Diaz Meyer, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, for their eloquent photographs depicting both the violence and poignancy of the war with Iraq.
* Commentary: 
**Leonard Pitts Jr., &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, for his fresh, vibrant columns that spoke, with both passion and compassion, to ordinary people on often divisive issues.
* Criticism: 
**Dan Neil, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, for his one-of-a-kind reviews of automobiles, blending technical expertise with offbeat humor and astute cultural observations.
* Editorial Cartooning: 
**Matt Davies, &quot;Journal News&quot;, for his piercing cartoons on an array of topics, drawn with a fresh, original style.
* Editorial Writing: 
**William Stall, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, for his incisive editorials that analyzed California&#x27;s troubled state government, prescribed remedies and served as a model for addressing complex state issues.
* Explanatory Reporting: 
**Kevin Helliker and Thomas M. Burton, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, for their groundbreaking examination of aneurysms, an often overlooked medical condition that kills thousands of Americans each year.
* Feature Photography: 
**Carolyn Cole, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, for her cohesive, behind-the-scenes look at the effects of civil war in Liberia, with special attention to innocent citizens caught in the conflict.
* Feature Writing: 
**not awarded
* International Reporting: 
**Anthony Shadid, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, for his extraordinary ability to capture, at personal peril, the voices and emotions of Iraqis as their country was invaded, their leader toppled and their way of life upended.
* Investigative Reporting: 
**Michael D. Sallah, Mitch Weiss and Joe Mahr of &quot;The Blade&quot;, for their powerful series on atrocities by Tiger Force, an elite U.S. Army platoon, during the Vietnam War.
* National Reporting: 
**Staff of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, for its engrossing examination of the tactics that have made Wal-Mart the largest company in the world with cascading effects across American towns and developing countries.
* Public Service: 
**&quot;The New York Times&quot;, for the work of David Barstow and Lowell Bergman that relentlessly examined death and injury among American workers and exposed employers who break basic safety rules. (This was moved by the board from the Investigative Reporting category, where it was also entered.)

**&quot;&quot; by William Taubman (W.W. Norton)
