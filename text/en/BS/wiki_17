<text>Spanish verbs form one of the more complex areas of Spanish grammar. Spanish is a relatively synthetic language with a moderate to high degree of inflection, which shows up mostly in Spanish conjugation.

As is typical of verbs in virtually all languages, Spanish verbs express an action or a state of being of a given subject, and like verbs in most Indo-European languages, Spanish verbs undergo inflection according to the following categories:

* Tense: past, present, or future
* Number: singular or plural
* Person: first, second or third
* T–V distinction: familiar or formal
* Mood: indicative, subjunctive, or imperative
* Aspect: perfective or imperfective (distinguished only in the past tense as preterite and imperfect)
* Voice: active or passive

The modern Spanish verb paradigm (conjugation) has 16 distinct complete forms (tenses), i.e. sets of forms for each combination of tense, mood and aspect, plus one incomplete tense (the imperative), as well as three non-temporal forms (the infinitive, gerund, and past participle). Two of the tenses, namely both subjunctive futures, are now obsolete for most practical purposes.

The 16 &quot;regular&quot; forms (tenses) include 8 &quot;simple tenses&quot; and 8 &quot;compound tenses&quot;. The compound tenses are formed with the auxiliary verb &quot;haber&quot; plus the past participle. Verbs can be used in other forms, such as the present progressive, but in grammar treatises they are not usually considered a part of the paradigm but rather periphrastic verbal constructions.

==Verbal inflection==
Spanish verbs are inflected to convey mood, tense, voice, and aspect, and to agree with person and number.

===Person and number===
Spanish verbs are conjugated in three persons, each having a singular and a plural form. In some varieties of Spanish, such as that of the Río de la Plata Region, a special form of the second person is used.

Spanish is a pro-drop language, meaning that subject pronouns are often omitted.

====First person====
The grammatical first person refers to the speaker (&quot;I&quot;). The first person plural refers to the speaker together with at least one other person.

* &quot;(Yo) soy&quot;: &quot;I am&quot;
* &quot;(Nosotros/Nosotras) somos&quot;: &quot;We are&quot;; the feminine form &quot;nosotras&quot; is used only when referring to a group that is composed entirely of females; otherwise, &quot;nosotros&quot; is used.

====Second person====
The grammatical second person refers to the addressee, the receiver of the communication (&quot;you&quot;). Spanish has different pronouns (and verb forms) for &quot;you,&quot; depending on the relationship, familiar or formal, between speaker and addressee.

Singular forms
* &quot;(Tú) eres&quot;: &quot;You are&quot;; familiar singular; used when addressing someone who is of close affinity (a member of the family, a close friend, a child, a pet). It is also the form used to address a deity.
* &quot;(Vos) sos&quot;: &quot;You are&quot;; familiar singular; generally used in the same way as &quot;tú&quot;. Its use is restricted to some areas of Hispanic America; where &quot;tú&quot; and &quot;vos&quot; are both used, &quot;vos&quot; is used to denote a closer affinity.
* &quot;(Usted) es&quot;: &quot;You are&quot;; formal singular; used when addressing a person respectfully, someone older, someone not known to the speaker, or someone of some social distance. Although it is a second-person pronoun, it uses third-person verb forms (and object pronouns and possessives) because it developed as a contraction of &quot;vuestra merced&quot; (literally, &quot;your mercy&quot; or &quot;your grace&quot;).

Plural forms
* &quot;(Vosotros/Vosotras) sois&quot;: &quot;You (all) are&quot;; familiar plural; used when addressing people who are of close affinity (members of the family, friends, children, pets). The feminine form &quot;vosotras&quot; is used only when addressing a group composed entirely of females; otherwise, &quot;vosotros&quot; is used. Used primarily in Spain but is also used in Equatorial Guinea and the Philippines, though it may appear in old, formal texts from other countries, such as the first initial line of the Argentine national anthem (&quot;Oíd, mortales, el grito sagrado&quot;).
* &quot;(Ustedes) son&quot;: &quot;You (all) are&quot;; formal plural where &quot;vosotros&quot; is used; both familiar and formal plural elsewhere. Where it is strictly formal, used when addressing people respectfully or addressing people of some social distance. Like &quot;usted&quot;, it uses third-person verb forms, for the same reasons.

====Third person====
The grammatical third person refers to a person or thing other than the speaker or the addressee.

Singular forms
* &quot;(Él) es&quot;: &quot;He/it is&quot;; used for a male person or a thing of masculine (grammatical) gender.
* &quot;(Ella) es&quot;: &quot;She/it is&quot;; used for a female person or a thing of feminine (grammatical) gender.
* &quot;(Ello) es&quot;: &quot;It is&quot;; used to refer to neuter nouns such as facts, ideas, situations, and sets of things; rarely used as an explicit subject.

Plural forms
* &quot;(Ellos) son&quot;: &quot;They are&quot;; used for a group of people or things that includes at least one person or thing of masculine (grammatical) gender.
* &quot;(Ellas) son&quot;: &quot;They are&quot;; used for a group of people or things that are all of feminine (grammatical) gender.

===Mood===

Grammatical mood is one of a set of distinctive forms that are used to signal modality. In Spanish, every verb has forms in three moods. In older classifications there was a fourth mood, the conditional, that included the two conditional tenses (simple and compound), but nowadays those tenses are included in the indicative mood.

* Indicative mood: The indicative mood, or evidential mood, is used for factual statements and positive beliefs. The Spanish conditional, although semantically expressing the dependency of one action or proposition on another, is generally considered indicative in mood, because, syntactically, it can appear in an independent clause.
* Subjunctive mood: The subjunctive mood expresses an imagined, possible or desired action in the past, present, or future.
* Imperative mood: The imperative mood expresses direct commands, requests, and prohibitions. In Spanish, using the imperative mood may sound blunt or even rude in some social settings, so it should be used with care.

===Tense===
The tense of a verb indicates the time when the action occurs. It may be in the past, present, or future.

=== Impersonal or non-finite forms of the verb ===
Non-finite verb forms refer to an action or state without indicating the time or person, and it is not conjugated for subject. Spanish has three non-finite forms: the infinitive, the gerund, and the past participle.

==== Infinitive ====
The infinitive is generally the form found in dictionaries. It corresponds to the English &quot;base-form&quot; or &quot;dictionary form&quot; and is usually indicated in English by &quot;to _____&quot; (&quot;to sing,&quot; &quot;to write,&quot; etc.). The ending of the infinitive is the basis of the names given in English to the three classes of Spanish verbs:

* &quot;-ar&quot; verbs (&quot;primera conjugación&quot; [&quot;first conjugation&quot;])
: Examples: &quot;hablar&quot; (&quot;to speak&quot;); &quot;cantar&quot; (&quot;to sing&quot;); &quot;bailar&quot; (&quot;to dance&quot;)

* &quot;-er&quot; verbs (&quot;segunda conjugación&quot; [&quot;second conjugation&quot;])
: Examples: &quot;beber&quot; (&quot;to drink&quot;); &quot;leer&quot; (&quot;to read&quot;); &quot;comprender&quot; (&quot;to understand&quot;)

* &quot;-ir&quot; verbs (&quot;tercera conjugación&quot; [&quot;third conjugation&quot;])
: Examples: &quot;vivir&quot; (&quot;to live&quot;); &quot;sentir&quot; (&quot;to feel&quot;); &quot;escribir&quot; (&quot;to write&quot;)

==== Gerund ====
Although in English grammar the gerund refers to the &quot;-ing&quot; form of the verb used as a noun, in Spanish the term refers to a verb form that behaves more like an adverb. It is created by adding the following endings to the stem of the verb (i.e. the infinitive without the last two letters):

* &quot;-ar&quot; verbs: -ando
: Examples: &quot;hablando&quot; (&quot;speaking&quot;); &quot;cantando&quot; (&quot;singing&quot;); &quot;bailando&quot; (&quot;dancing&quot;)

* &quot;-er&quot; verbs: -iendo
: Examples: &quot;bebiendo&quot; (&quot;drinking&quot;); &quot;leyendo&quot; (with spelling change; &quot;reading&quot;); &quot;comprendiendo&quot; (&quot;understanding&quot;)

* &quot;-ir&quot; verbs: -iendo
: Examples: &quot;viviendo&quot; (&quot;living&quot;); &quot;sintiendo&quot; (with stem-vowel change; &quot;feeling&quot;); &quot;escribiendo&quot; (&quot;writing&quot;)
Certain verbs have irregular gerund forms:
* Most &quot;-ir&quot; verbs undergo a predictable stem-vowel change: &quot;sentir&quot; → &quot;sintiendo&quot;, &quot;medir&quot; → &quot;midiendo&quot;, &quot;repetir&quot; → &quot;repitiendo&quot;, &quot;dormir&quot; → &quot;durmiendo&quot;, &quot;morir&quot; → &quot;muriendo&quot;. One &quot;-er&quot; verb also belongs to this group: &quot;poder&quot; → &quot;pudiendo&quot;.
* In verbs whose stem ends in a vowel, the spelling of the &quot;-iendo&quot; ending is changed to &quot;-yendo&quot;: &quot;oír&quot; → &quot;oyendo&quot;, &quot;caer&quot; → &quot;cayendo&quot;, &quot;leer&quot; → &quot;leyendo&quot;, &quot;traer&quot; → &quot;trayendo&quot;, &quot;construir&quot; → &quot;construyendo&quot;, &quot;huir&quot; → &quot;huyendo&quot;. The &quot;stemless&quot; verb &quot;ir&quot; belongs to this group, with &quot;yendo&quot;.
* For &quot;-er&quot; and &quot;-ir&quot; verbs whose stem ends in or , the &quot;-iendo&quot; ending is reduced to &quot;-endo&quot;: &quot;tañer&quot; → &quot;tañendo&quot;, &quot;bullir&quot; → &quot;bullendo&quot;.

The gerund has a variety of uses and can mean (with &quot;haciendo&quot;, for example) &quot;doing/while doing/by doing/because of one&#x27;s doing/through doing&quot; and so on. It is also used to form progressive constructions, such as &quot;estoy haciendo&quot; (&quot;I am doing&quot;). The gerund cannot be used as an adjective and generally has no corresponding adjectival forms. The now-mostly archaic present participle, which ended in &quot;-ante&quot; or &quot;-iente&quot; and formerly filled this function, in some cases survives as such an adjective (e.g. &quot;durmiente&quot; (&quot;sleeping&quot;), &quot;interesante&quot; (&quot;interesting&quot;)), but they are limited, and in cases where it does not, other constructions must be used to express the same ideas: where in English one would say &quot;the crying baby&quot;, one would say in Spanish &quot;el bebé que llora&quot; (&quot;the baby who&#x27;s crying&quot;; &quot;llorante&quot; is archaic).

==== Past participle ====

The past participle corresponds to the English &quot;-en&quot; or &quot;-ed&quot; form of the verb. It is created by adding the following endings to the verb stem:

* &quot;-ar&quot; verbs: -ado
: Examples: &quot;hablado&quot; (&quot;spoken&quot;); &quot;cantado&quot; (&quot;sung&quot;); &quot;bailado&quot; (&quot;danced&quot;)

* &quot;-er&quot; verbs: -ido
: Examples: &quot;bebido&quot; (&quot;drunk&quot;); &quot;leído&quot; (requires accent mark; &quot;read&quot;); &quot;comprendido&quot; (&quot;understood&quot;)

* &quot;-ir&quot; verbs,: -ido
: Examples: &quot;vivido&quot; (&quot;lived&quot;); &quot;sentido&quot; (&quot;felt&quot;); &quot;hervido&quot; (&quot;boiled&quot;)

The past participle, ending invariably in &quot;-o&quot;, is used following the auxiliary verb &quot;haber&quot; to form the compound or perfect: &quot;(Yo) he hablado (&quot;I have spoken&quot;); &quot;(Ellos) habían hablado (&quot;They had spoken&quot;); etc.

When the past participle is used as an adjective, it inflects for both gender and number – for example, &quot;una lengua hablada en España&quot; (&quot;a language spoken in Spain&quot;).

===Voice===
In grammar, the voice of a verb describes the relationship between the action (or state) that the verb expresses and the participants identified by its arguments (subject, object, etc.). When the subject is the agent or doer of the action, the verb is in the active voice. When the subject is the patient, target, or undergoer of the action, it is said to be in the passive voice.

===Verbal aspect===
Verbal aspect marks whether an action is completed (perfect), a completed whole (perfective), or not yet completed (imperfective).

* Perfect: In Spanish, verbs that are conjugated with haber (&quot;to have [done something]&quot;) are in the perfect aspect.
* Perfective: In Spanish, verbs in the preterite are in the perfective aspect.
* Imperfective: In Spanish, the present, imperfect, and future tenses are in the imperfective aspect.

==Conjugation==

In this page, verb conjugation is illustrated with the verb &quot;hablar&quot; (&quot;to talk,&quot; &quot;to speak&quot;).

===The indicative===

The indicative mood has five simple tenses, each of which has a corresponding perfect form. In older classifications, the conditional tenses were considered part of an independent &quot;conditional mood&quot;, but now are grouped with the indicative. Continuous forms (such as &quot;estoy hablando&quot;) are usually not considered part of the verbal paradigm, though they often appear in books addressed to English speakers who are learning Spanish. Modern grammatical studies count only the simple forms as tenses, and the other forms as products of tenses and aspects.

==== Simple tenses (&quot;tiempos simples&quot;) ====
The simple tenses are the forms of the verb without the use of a modal or helping verb. The following are the simple tenses and their uses:

===== Present (&quot;presente&quot;) =====
The present tense is formed with the endings shown below:
Uses

The present is used to indicate the following:

* Punctual present: This expresses an action that is being done at the very moment.

:&quot;María habla con Juan por teléfono&quot; = &quot;María is speaking with Juan on the telephone&quot;

* Continuous present or durative present: This expresses an action that is being done from the moment of speaking, extending into the past and future.

:&quot;Yo vivo en Madrid&quot; = &quot;I live in Madrid&quot;
:&quot;El museo exhibe las obras de Miró&quot; = &quot;The museum is exhibiting works by Miró&quot;

* Habitual present: This expresses an action that is regularly and habitually being done.

:&quot;María va al campo todos los sábados&quot; = &quot;María goes to the countryside every Saturday&quot;

* Gnomic present: This expresses general truths that are not bounded by time.

:&quot;Dos más dos son cuatro&quot; = &quot;Two plus two equals four&quot;
:&quot;Los planetas giran alrededor del sol&quot; = &quot;The planets revolve around the sun&quot;

* Historical present: This expresses an action that happened in the past but is accepted as historical fact.

:&quot;Fernando Magallanes descubre las Filipinas el 15 de marzo de 1521&quot; = &quot;Ferdinand Magellan discovers the Philippines on March 15th, 1521&quot;

* An immediate future (near future): This expresses an action that will be done in the very near future with a high degree of certainty.

:&quot;Este junio, viajo a España&quot; = &quot;This June, I am travelling to Spain&quot;

* Imperative value: In some areas of Spain and Hispanic America, the present can be used (with an exclamatory tone) with an imperative value.

:&quot;¡Ahora te vas y pides disculpas al señor Ruiz!&quot; = &quot;Now go and apologize to Mr. Ruiz!&quot;

===== Imperfect (&quot;pretérito imperfecto&quot;) =====
The imperfect is formed with the endings shown below. There are three irregular verbs in the imperfect tense: &quot;ser&quot;, &quot;ir&quot; and &quot;ver&quot;:

Uses

The imperfect is used to express the following:

* Habitual action in the past: This use expresses an action done habitually in an indefinite past. It does not focus on when the action ended.

:&quot;Cuando era pequeño, hablaba español con mi abuela&quot; = &quot;When I was young, I spoke Spanish with my grandmother&quot;

* An action interrupted by another action: This expresses an action that was in progress when another action took place.

:&quot;Tomábamos la cena cuando entró Eduardo&quot; = &quot;We were having dinner when Eduardo came in&quot;

*General description of the past: This expresses a past setting, as, for example, the background for a narrative.

:&quot;Todo estaba tranquilo esa noche. Juan Eduardo miraba el partido de fútbol con su amigo Alejandro. Comían unas porciones de pizza.&quot; = &quot;Everything was calm that night. Juan Eduardo was watching the football match with his friend Alejandro. They were eating some slices of pizza.&quot;

===== Preterite (&quot;pretérito indefinido&quot;) =====
The preterite is formed with the endings shown below:

Uses

The preterite is used to express the following:

* An action that was done in the past: This use expresses an action that is viewed as a completed event. It is often accompanied by adverbial expressions of time, such as &quot;ayer&quot;, &quot;anteayer&quot;, or &quot;la semana pasada&quot;.

:&quot;Ayer, encontré la flor que tú me diste&quot; = &quot;Yesterday, I found the flower that you gave me&quot;

* An action that interrupts another action: This expresses an event that happened (and was completed) while another action was taking place.

:&quot;Tomábamos la cena cuando entró Eduardo&quot; = &quot;We were having dinner when Eduardo came in&quot;

*A general truth: This expresses a past relationship that is viewed as finished.

:&quot;Las Filipinas fueron parte del Imperio Español&quot; = &quot;The Philippines were part of the Spanish Empire&quot;

===== Future (&quot;futuro simple&quot; or &quot;futuro imperfecto&quot;) =====
The future tense uses the entire infinitive as a stem. The following endings are attached to it:

Uses

The future is used to express the following:

* A future action: This expresses an action that will be done in the future.

:&quot;El año próximo, visitaré Buenos Aires&quot; = &quot;Next year, I shall/will visit Buenos Aires&quot;

* Uncertainty or probability: This expresses inference, rather than direct knowledge.

:&quot;¿Quién estará tocando a la puerta? — Será Fabio.&quot; = &quot;Who (do you suppose) is knocking at the door? — It must be Fabio&quot;. (An analogous use of the future tense occurs in English, as in &quot;That&#x27;ll be Fabio&quot;.) 

* Command, prohibition, or obligation:

:&quot;No llevarás a ese hombre a mi casa&quot; = &quot;Do not bring that man to my house&quot; or, more accurately, &quot;You will not bring that man to my house&quot;; this form is also used to assert a command, prohibition, or obligation in English. The biblical Ten Commandments are commonly expressed in the future tense in Spanish (e.g. &quot;No matarás&quot;).

* Courtesy:

:&quot;¿Te importará encender la televisión?&quot; = &quot;Would you mind turning on the television?&quot;

Another common way to represent future time is with a present indicative conjugation of &quot;ir&quot;, followed by &quot;a&quot;, followed by an infinitive verb: &quot;Voy a viajar a Bolivia en el verano&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m going to travel to Bolivia in the summer&quot;). The difference between the use of the two forms varies according to dialect, but the &quot;&quot;ir a&quot; + [infinitive]&quot; construction tends to be more colloquial. Also, this construction—unlike the simple future form—is not used in the &quot;probability&quot; sense to express conjecture.

===== Simple conditional (&quot;condicional simple&quot; or &quot;pospretérito&quot;) =====
As with the future, the conditional uses the entire infinitive as the stem. The following endings are attached to it:

Uses

The conditional is used to express the following:

* Courtesy: Using this mood softens a request, making it more polite.

:&quot;Señor, ¿podría darme una copa de vino?&quot; = &quot;Sir, could you give me a glass of wine?&quot;

* Polite expression of a desire (using &quot;querer&quot;):

:&quot;Querría ver la película esta semana&quot; = &quot;I would like to see the film this week&quot;

* In a &quot;then&quot; clause whose realization depends on a hypothetical &quot;if&quot; clause:

:&quot;Si yo fuera rico, viajaría a Sudamérica&quot; = &quot;If I were rich, I would travel to South America&quot;

* Speculation about past events (the speaker&#x27;s knowledge is indirect, unconfirmed, or approximating):

:&quot;¿Cuántas personas asistieron a la inauguración del Presidente? — No lo sé; habría unas 5.000&quot; = &quot;How many people attended the President&#x27;s inauguration? — I do not know; there must have been about 5,000&quot;)

* A future action in relation to the past: This expresses future action that was imagined in the past.

:&quot;Cuando era pequeño, pensaba que me gustaría ser médico&quot; = &quot;When I was young, I thought that I would like to be a doctor&quot;

* A suggestion:

:&quot;Yo que tú, lo olvidaría completamente&quot; = &quot;If I were you, I would forget him completely&quot;

==== Compound tenses (&quot;tiempos compuestos&quot;) ====
All the compound tenses are formed with &quot;haber&quot; followed by the past participle of the main verb. &quot;Haber&quot; changes its form for person, number, and the like, while the past participle remains invariable, ending with &quot;-o&quot; regardless of the number or gender of the subject.

===== Present perfect (&quot;pretérito perfecto&quot;) =====
In the present perfect, the present indicative of &quot;haber&quot; is used as an auxiliary, and it is followed by the past participle of the main verb. In most of Spanish America, this tense has virtually the same use as the English present perfect:
*&quot;Te he dicho mi opinión&quot; = &quot;I have told you my opinion&quot;

In most of Spain the tense has an additional use—to express a past action or event that is contained in a still-ongoing period of time or that has effects in the present:
*&quot;Este mes ha llovido mucho, pero hoy hace buen día&quot; = &quot;It has rained a lot this month, but today is a fine day&quot;

Occasionally &quot;tener&quot; and &quot;llevar&quot; are used with the past participle of a transitive verb for an effect that is similar to the present perfect. In these cases the participle usually agrees in gender and number with the direct object:
*&quot;Ya tengo compradas las entradas para nosotros.&quot; = &quot;I have already bought the tickets for us&quot; (Speaking of the effects in the present)
*&quot;Llevo grabados tres discos&quot; = &quot;I have recorded three records&quot;

===== Past perfect or pluperfect (&quot;pretérito pluscuamperfecto&quot;) =====
In this tense, the imperfect form of &quot;haber&quot; is used as a modal, and it is followed by the past participle of the main verb:

* &quot;(yo) había&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(tú) habías&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(él/ella/ello/usted) había&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(nosotros/nosotras) habíamos&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(vosotros/vosotras) habíais&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(ellos/ellas/ustedes) habían&quot; + past participle

Uses

The past perfect is used to express the following:

* A past action that occurred prior to another past action:

:&quot;Yo había esperado tres horas cuando él llegó&quot; = &quot;I had waited for three hours when he arrived&quot;

===== Past anterior (&quot;pretérito anterior&quot;) =====
The past anterior combines the preterite form of &quot;haber&quot; with the past participle of the main verb. It is very rare in spoken Spanish, but it is sometimes used in formal written language, where it is almost entirely limited to subordinate (temporal, adverbial) clauses. Thus, it is usually introduced by temporal conjunctions such as &quot;cuando&quot;, &quot;apenas&quot;, or &quot;en cuanto&quot;. It is used to express an action that ended immediately before another past action:

* &quot;(yo) hube&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(tú) hubiste&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(él/ella/ello/usted) hubo&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(nosotros/nosotras) hubimos&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(vosotros/vosotras) hubisteis&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(ellos/ellas/ustedes) hubieron&quot; + past participle

For example:
*&quot;Cuando hubieron llegado todos, empezó la ceremonia&quot; = &quot;When everyone had arrived, the ceremony began&quot;
*&quot;Apenas María hubo terminado la canción, su padre entró&quot; = &quot;As soon as Maria had finished the song, her father came in&quot;

It is often replaced by either the preterite or the pluperfect, with the same meaning:

*&quot;Apenas María terminó la canción, su padre entró&quot;
*&quot;Apenas María había terminado la canción, su padre entró&quot;

===== Future perfect (&quot;futuro compuesto&quot;) =====
The future perfect is formed with the future indicative of &quot;haber&quot; followed by the past participle of the main verb:

* &quot;(yo) habré&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(tú) habrás&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(él/ella/ello/usted) habrá&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(nosotros/nosotras) habremos&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(vosotros/vosotras) habréis&quot; + past participle
* &quot;(ellos/ellas/ustedes) habrán&quot; + past participle

For example:
*&quot;Habré hablado&quot; = &quot;I shall/will have spoken&quot;

It is used to indicate a future action that will be finished right before another action:

*&quot;Cuando yo llegue a la fiesta, ya se habrán marchado todos&quot; = &quot;When I get to the party, everyone will already have left&quot;

===== Conditional perfect or compound conditional (&quot;condicional compuesto&quot; or &quot;antepospretérito&quot;) =====
The conditional perfect refers to a hypothetical past action.

For example:

*&quot;Yo habría hablado si me hubieran/hubiesen dado la oportunidad&quot; = &quot;I would have spoken if they had given me the opportunity to&quot;

===The imperative===
The imperative mood has three specific forms, corresponding to the pronouns &quot;tú&quot;, &quot;vos&quot;, and &quot;vosotros&quot; (&quot;tú&quot; and &quot;vos&quot; are used in different regional dialects; &quot;vosotros&quot; only in Spain). These forms are used only in positive expressions, not negative ones. The subjunctive supplements the imperative in all other cases (negative expressions and the conjugations corresponding to the pronouns &quot;nosotros&quot;, &quot;él/ella&quot;, &quot;usted&quot;, &quot;ellos/ellas&quot;, and &quot;ustedes&quot;).

The imperative can also be expressed in three other ways:
* Using the present or future indicative to form an emphatic command: &quot;Comerás la verdura&quot; (&quot;You will eat the vegetables&quot;)
* The first person plural imperative (&quot;Let&#x27;s...&quot;) can also be expressed by &quot;Vamos a&quot; + infinitive: &quot;¡Vamos a comer!&quot;
* Indirect commands with &quot;que&quot;: &quot;Que lo llame el secretario&quot; (&quot;Have the secretary call him&quot;)

==== Affirmative imperative (&quot;imperativo positivo&quot;) ====
The positive form of the imperative mood in regular verbs is formed by adding the following to the stem:

The singular imperative &quot;tú&quot; coincides with the third-person singular of the indicative for all but a few irregular verbs. The plural &quot;vosotros&quot; is always the same as the infinitive, but with a final &quot;-d&quot; instead of an &quot;-r&quot; in the formal, written form; the informal spoken form is the same as the infinitive. The singular &quot;vos&quot; drops the &quot;-r&quot; of the infinitive, requiring a written accent to indicate the stress.

==== Negative imperative (&quot;imperativo negativo&quot;) ====
For the negative imperative, the adverb &quot;no&quot; is placed before the verb, and the following endings are attached to the stem:

Note that in the imperative, the affirmative second-person forms differ from their negative counterparts; this is the only case of a difference in conjugation between affirmative and negative in Spanish.

=====Emphasizing the subject=====
If one wishes to place emphasis on the subject of a command, it is placed after the verbal word:
* &quot;Hazlo tú&quot; = &quot;You do it&quot;
* &quot;No lo diga usted&quot; = &quot;Don&#x27;t you [polite] say it&quot;

==== Examples ====

===== Positive command forms of the verb &quot;comer&quot; =====

===== Negative command forms of the verb &quot;comer&quot; =====

===== The pronominal verb &quot;comerse&quot; =====

Note that the pronouns precede the verb in the negative commands as the mode is subjunctive, not imperative: &quot;no te comas/comás&quot;; &quot;no se coma/coman&quot;; &quot;no nos comamos&quot;; &quot;no os comáis&quot;.

===== The verb &quot;ir&quot; =====

The pronominal verb &quot;irse&quot; is irregular in the second person plural normative form, because it does not drop the &quot;-d&quot; or the &quot;-r&quot;:
* &quot;¡idos! (vosotros)&quot;: &quot;Go away!&quot; (plural for informal address, prescribed by the Real Academia Española but extremely uncommon)
* &quot;¡iros! (vosotros)&quot;: &quot;Go away!&quot; (common in Spain, recently admitted by the Real Academia Española) 

===The subjunctive===

The subjunctive mood has a separate conjugation table with fewer tenses. It is used, almost exclusively in subordinate clauses, to express the speaker&#x27;s opinion or judgment, such as doubts, possibilities, emotions, and events that may or may not occur.

==== Simple tenses (&quot;tiempos simples&quot;) ====

===== Present subjunctive (&quot;presente de subjuntivo&quot;) =====
The present subjunctive of regular verbs is formed with the endings shown below:

===== Imperfect subjunctive (&quot;imperfecto de subjuntivo&quot;) =====

The imperfect subjunctive can be formed with either of two sets of endings: the &quot;&quot;-ra&quot; endings&quot; or the &quot;&quot;-se&quot; endings&quot;, as shown below. In Spanish America, the &quot;-ra&quot; forms are virtually the only forms used, to the exclusion of the &quot;-se&quot; forms. In Spain, both sets of forms are used, but the &quot;-ra&quot; forms are predominant as well.

======Imperfect subjunctive, &quot;-ra&quot; forms======

======Imperfect subjunctive, &quot;-se&quot; forms======

===== Future subjunctive (&quot;futuro (simple) de subjuntivo&quot;) =====
The future subjunctive is no longer used in modern language, except in legal language and some fixed expressions. The following endings are attached to the preterite stem:

For example:
*&quot;Cuando hablaren...&quot; = &quot;Whenever they might speak...&quot;

==== Compound tenses (&quot;tiempos compuestos&quot;) ====
In the subjunctive mood, the subjunctive forms of the verb &quot;haber&quot; are used with the past participle of the main verb.

===== Present perfect subjunctive (&quot;pretérito perfecto de subjuntivo&quot;) =====
*&quot;Cuando yo haya hablado...&quot; = &quot;When I have spoken...&quot;

===== Pluperfect subjunctive (&quot;pluscuamperfecto de subjuntivo&quot;) =====
*&quot;Si yo hubiera hablado...&quot; or &quot;Si yo hubiese hablado...&quot; = &quot;If I had spoken...&quot;

===== Future perfect subjunctive (&quot;futuro compuesto de subjuntivo&quot;) =====
Like the simple future subjunctive, this tense is no longer used in modern Spanish.
*&quot;Cuando yo hubiere hablado...&quot; = &quot;When I shall have spoken...&quot;

===Continuous tenses===
In Spanish grammar, continuous tenses are not formally recognized as in English. Although the imperfect expresses a continuity compared to the perfect (e.g., &quot;te esperaba&quot; [&quot;I was waiting for you&quot;]), the continuity of an action is usually expressed by a verbal periphrasis (&quot;perífrasis verbal&quot;), as in &quot;estoy leyendo&quot; (&quot;I am reading&quot;). However, one can also say &quot;sigo leyendo&quot; (&quot;I am &quot;still&quot; reading&quot;), &quot;voy leyendo&quot; (&quot;I am &quot;slowly but surely&quot; reading&quot;), &quot;ando leyendo&quot; (&quot;I am &quot;going around&quot; reading&quot;), and others.

===The passive===
====&quot;True&quot; passive====
The &quot;true&quot; passive is formed with &quot;ser&quot; + the past participle, which in this case behaves like a normal adjective. Thus:
* &quot;Yo soy amado&quot; = &quot;I [masc.] am loved&quot;
* &quot;Tú eras amada&quot; = &quot;You [fem.] were being loved&quot;
* &quot;Nosotros seremos amados&quot; = &quot;We [masc.] will be loved&quot;
* &quot;Ellas habrían sido amadas&quot; = &quot;They [fem.] would have been loved&quot;

The &quot;true&quot; passive is used in a variety of situations, but its use is somewhat more limited than that of its English counterpart.

====&quot;Se&quot; passive====
In the third person, reflexive constructions are often used to express ideas that could also be expressed in the passive. In such constructions, the recipient of the action is said to do the action to itself. Thus:
* &quot;Se habla español&quot; = &quot;Spanish is spoken&quot; (lit. &quot;Spanish speaks itself&quot;)
* &quot;Se me dio el libro&quot; = &quot;The book was given to me&quot; (lit. &quot;The book gave itself to me&quot;)
* &quot;Se perdieron los datos&quot; = &quot;The data were lost&quot; (lit. &quot;The data lost themselves&quot;)
* &quot;Se puede hacer [ello]&quot; = &quot;It can be done&quot; (lit. &quot;It can do itself&quot;)

The &quot;se&quot; passive is very common in the third person, but equivalent constructions cannot be used for the first and second persons: &quot;Yo me amo&quot; always translates to &quot;I love myself&quot; and never &quot;I am loved&quot;.

==Irregular verbs==
A considerable number of verbs change the vowel &quot;e&quot; in the stem to the diphthong &quot;ie&quot;, and the vowel &quot;o&quot; to &quot;ue&quot;. This happens when the stem vowel receives the stress. These verbs are referred to as stem-changing verbs. Examples include &quot;pensar&quot; (&quot;to think&quot;; e.g., &quot;pienso&quot; [&quot;I think&quot;]), &quot;sentarse&quot; (&quot;to sit&quot;; e.g., &quot;me siento&quot; [&quot;I sit&quot;]), &quot;empezar&quot; (&quot;to begin&quot;; e.g., &quot;empiezo&quot; [&quot;I begin&quot;]), &quot;volver&quot; (&quot;to return&quot;; e.g., &quot;vuelvo&quot; [&quot;I return&quot;]), and &quot;acostarse&quot; (&quot;to go to bed&quot;; e.g., &quot;me acuesto&quot; [&quot;I go to bed&quot;]).

Virtually all verbs of the third conjugation (&quot;-ir&quot;), if they have an &quot;-e-&quot; or &quot;-o-&quot; as the last vowel of their stem, undergo a vowel-raising change whereby &quot;e&quot; changes to &quot;i&quot; and &quot;o&quot; changes to &quot;u&quot;, in some of their forms (for details, see Spanish irregular verbs). Examples include &quot;pedir&quot; (&quot;to ask for&quot;; e.g., &quot;pide&quot; [&quot;he/she asks for&quot;]), &quot;competir&quot; (&quot;to compete&quot;; e.g., &quot;compite&quot; [&quot;he/she competes&quot;]), and &quot;derretirse&quot; (&quot;to melt&quot;; e.g., &quot;se derrite&quot; [&quot;it melts&quot;]).

The so-called I-go verbs add a medial &quot;-g-&quot; in the first-person singular present tense (making the &quot;Yo&quot; [&quot;I&quot;] form end in &quot;-go&quot;; e.g., &quot;tener&quot; [&quot;to have&quot;] becomes &quot;tengo&quot; [&quot;I have&quot;]; &quot;venir&quot; [&quot;to come&quot;] becomes &quot;vengo&quot; [&quot;I come&quot;]). The &quot;-g-&quot; is present in the present subjunctive of such verbs. These verbs are often irregular in other forms as well.

==Usage==

===Contrasting simple and continuous forms===

There is no strict distinction between simple and continuous forms in Spanish as there is in English. In English, &quot;I do&quot; is one thing (a habit) and &quot;I am doing&quot; is another (current activity). In Spanish, &quot;hago&quot; can be either of the two, and &quot;estoy haciendo&quot; stresses the latter. Although not as strict as English, Spanish is stricter than French or German, which have no systematic distinction between the two concepts at all. This optionally continuous meaning that can be underlined by using the continuous form is a feature of the present and imperfect. The preterite never has this meaning, even in the continuous form, and the future has it only when it is in the continuous form.

;Present
*&quot;¿Qué haces?&quot; could be either &quot;What do you do?&quot; or &quot;What are you doing?&quot;
*&quot;¿Qué estás haciendo?&quot; is only &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

;Imperfect
*&quot;¿Qué hacías?&quot; could be either &quot;What did you use to do?&quot; or &quot;What were you doing?&quot;
*&quot;¿Qué estabas haciendo?&quot; is only &quot;What were you doing?&quot;

;Preterite
*&quot;¿Qué hiciste?&quot; is &quot;What did you do?&quot;
*&quot;¿Qué estuviste haciendo?&quot; is &quot;What were you doing (all of that time)?&quot;

Note that since the preterite by nature refers to an event seen as having a beginning and an end, and not as a context, the use of the continuous form of the verb only adds a feeling for the length of time spent on the action. The future has two main forms in Spanish, the imperfect (compound) future and the simple one. The difference between them is one of aspect. The compound future is done with the conjugated &quot;ir&quot; (which means &quot;to go,&quot; but may also mean &quot;will&quot; in this case) plus the infinitive and, sometimes, with a present progressive verb added as well.

;Future:
* &quot;¿Qué vas a hacer?&quot; is &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; (implies that it will be done again, as in a routine)
* &quot;¿Qué vas a estar haciendo?&quot; is &quot;What are you going to be doing?&quot; (does not necessarily imply that it will be done)
*&quot;¿Qué harás?&quot; is &quot;What will you do?&quot; (will be completed immediately, or done just once)
*&quot;¿Qué estarás haciendo?&quot; is &quot;What will you be doing?&quot;

===Contrasting the present and the future===

Both the present and the future can express future actions, the latter more explicitly so. There are also expressions that convey the future.
*&quot;Mi padre llega mañana&quot; = &quot;My father arrives tomorrow&quot;
*&quot;Mi padre estará llegando mañana&quot; = &quot;My father will be arriving tomorrow&quot;
*&quot;Mi padre va a llegar mañana&quot; = &quot;My father is going to arrive tomorrow&quot; (future with &quot;ir&quot;)
*&quot;Mi padre llegará mañana&quot; = &quot;My father will arrive tomorrow&quot; (future tense)
*&quot;Mi padre está a punto de llegar&quot; = &quot;My father is about to arrive&quot; (immediate future with &quot;estar a punto&quot;)

The future tense can also simply express guesses about the present and immediate future:
*&quot;¿Qué hora es?&quot; &quot;Serán las tres&quot; = &quot;What time is it?&quot; &quot;It is about three (but I have not checked)&quot;
*&quot;¿Quién llama a la puerta? Será José&quot; = &quot;Who is at the door? It must be José&quot;

The same is applied to imperfect and conditional:
*&quot;¿Qué hora era?&quot; &quot;Serían las tres&quot; = &quot;What time was it?&quot; &quot;It was about three (but I had not checked)&quot;
*&quot;¿Quién llamaba a la puerta? Sería José&quot; = &quot;Who was at the door? It must have been José&quot;

Studies have shown that Spanish-speaking children learn this use of the future tense before they learn to use it to express future events (the English future with &quot;will&quot; can also sometimes be used with this meaning). The other constructions detailed above are used instead. Indeed, in some areas, such as Argentina and Uruguay, speakers hardly use the future tense to refer to the future.

The future tense of the subjunctive mood is also obsolete in practice. As of today, it is only found in legal documents and the like. In other contexts, the present subjunctive form always replaces it.

===Contrasting the preterite and the imperfect===

====Fundamental meanings of the preterite and the imperfect====
Spanish has two fundamental past tenses, the preterite and the imperfect. Strictly speaking, the difference between them is one not of tense but of aspect, in a manner that is similar to that of the Slavic languages. However, within Spanish grammar, they are customarily called tenses.

The difference between the preterite and the imperfect (and in certain cases, the perfect) is often hard to grasp for English speakers. English has just one past-tense form, which can have aspect added to it by auxiliary verbs, but not in ways that reliably correspond to what occurs in Spanish. The distinction between them does, however, correspond rather well to the distinctions in other Romance languages, such as between the French &quot;imparfait&quot; and &quot;passé simple&quot; / &quot;passé composé&quot; or between the Italian &quot;imperfetto&quot; and &quot;passato remoto&quot; / &quot;passato prossimo&quot;.

The imperfect fundamentally presents an action or state as being a &quot;context&quot; and is thus essentially descriptive. It does not present actions or states as having ends and often does not present their beginnings either. Like the Slavic imperfective past, it tends to show actions that used to be done at some point, as in a routine. In this case, one would say &quot;Yo jugaba&quot; (&quot;I used to play&quot;), &quot;Yo leía&quot; (&quot;I used to read&quot;), or &quot;Yo escribía&quot; (&quot;I used to write&quot;). 

The preterite (as well as the perfect, when applicable) fundamentally presents an action or state as being an &quot;event&quot;, and is thus essentially narrative. It presents actions or states as having beginnings and ends. This also bears resemblance to the Slavic perfective past, as these actions are usually viewed as done in one stroke. The corresponding preterite forms would be &quot;Yo jugué&quot; (&quot;I played&quot;), &quot;Yo leí&quot; (&quot;I read&quot;) or &quot;Yo escribí&quot; (&quot;I wrote&quot;).

As stated above, deciding whether to use the preterite or the imperfect can present some difficulty for English speakers. But there are certain topics, words, and key phrases that can help one decide if the verb should be conjugated in the preterite or the imperfect. These expressions co-occur significantly more often with one or the other of the two tenses, corresponding to a completed action (preterite) or a repetitive action or a continuous action or state (imperfect) in the past.

Key words and phrases that tend to co-occur with the preterite tense:
* &quot;ayer&quot; (&quot;yesterday&quot;)
* &quot;anteayer&quot; (&quot;the day before yesterday&quot;)
* &quot;anoche&quot; (&quot;last night&quot;)
* &quot;durante dos siglos&quot; (&quot;for two centuries&quot;)
* &quot;por un rato&quot; (&quot;for a while&quot;)
* &quot;el otro día&quot; (&quot;the other day&quot;)

* &quot;entonces&quot; (&quot;then&quot;)
* &quot;luego&quot; (&quot;then&quot;; &quot;and then&quot;)
* &quot;esta mañana&quot; (&quot;this morning&quot;)
* &quot;esta tarde&quot; (&quot;this afternoon&quot;)
* &quot;la semana pasada&quot; (&quot;last week&quot;)

* &quot;el mes pasado&quot; (&quot;last month&quot;)
* &quot;el año pasado&quot; (&quot;last year&quot;)
* &quot;hace dos días/años&quot; (&quot;two days/years ago&quot;)
* &quot;de repente&quot; (&quot;suddenly&quot;)
* &quot;en 1954&quot;, etc. (years)

* &quot;el 25 de enero&quot;, etc. (dates)
* &quot;durante&quot; (&quot;during&quot;)
* &quot;muchas veces&quot; (&quot;many times&quot;)
* &quot;dos/tres veces&quot; (&quot;twice&quot;/&quot;three times&quot;)
* &quot;tantas veces&quot; (&quot;so many times&quot;)

* &quot;varias veces&quot; (&quot;several times&quot;)
* &quot;nunca&quot; (&quot;never&quot;)
* &quot;tan pronto como&quot; (&quot;as soon as&quot;)
* &quot;después de que&quot; (&quot;after&quot;)
* &quot;desde que&quot; (&quot;since&quot;)
E.g.: &quot;Esta mañana comí huevos y pan tostado&quot; (&quot;This morning I ate eggs and toast&quot;)

Key words and phrases that tend to co-occur with the imperfect tense:
* &quot;a menudo&quot; (&quot;often&quot;)
* &quot;a veces&quot; (&quot;sometimes&quot;)
* &quot;cada día&quot; (&quot;every day&quot;)
* &quot;cada semana&quot; (&quot;every week&quot;)
* &quot;cada mes&quot; (&quot;every month&quot;)
* &quot;cada año&quot; (&quot;every year&quot;)
* &quot;con frecuencia&quot; (&quot;frequently&quot;)
* &quot;de vez en cuando&quot; (&quot;from time to time&quot;)

* &quot;en aquella época&quot; (&quot;at that time&quot;)
* &quot;frecuentemente&quot; (&quot;frequently&quot;)
* &quot;generalmente&quot; (&quot;usually&quot;)
* &quot;todas las semanas&quot; (&quot;every week&quot;)
* &quot;todos los días&quot; (&quot;every day&quot;)
* &quot;todo el tiempo&quot; (&quot;all the time&quot;)
* &quot;constantemente&quot; (&quot;constantly&quot;)

* &quot;mientras&quot; (&quot;while&quot;)
* &quot;regularmente&quot; (&quot;regularly&quot;)
* &quot;por lo general&quot; (&quot;generally&quot;)
* &quot;todavía&quot; (&quot;still&quot;)
* &quot;ya&quot; (&quot;already&quot;)
* &quot;Eran las tres&quot;, etc. (&quot;It was three o&#x27;clock,&quot; etc.)
* &quot;Estaba nublado&quot;, etc. (&quot;It was cloudy,&quot; etc.)
E.g.: &quot;Cada año mi familia iba a Puerto Rico.&quot; (&quot;Each year my family went to Puerto Rico.&quot;)

====Comparison with English usage====
The English simple past can express either of these concepts. However, there are devices that allow us to be more specific. Consider, for example, the phrase &quot;the sun shone&quot; in the following contexts:
#&quot;The sun shone through his window; John knew that it was going to be a fine day.&quot;
#&quot;The sun was shining through his window; John knew that it was going to be a fine day.&quot;
#&quot;The sun shone through his window back in those days.&quot;
#&quot;The sun used to shine through his window back in those days.&quot;
#&quot;The sun shone through his window the moment that John pulled back the curtain.&quot;

In the first two, it is clear that the shining refers to the background to the events that are about to unfold in the story. It is talking about what &quot;was happening&quot;. One has a choice between making this explicit with the past continuous, as in (2), or using the simple past and allowing the context to make it clear what is intended, as in (1). In Spanish, these would be in the imperfect, optionally in the imperfect continuous.

In (3) and (4), it is clear that the shining refers to a regular, general, habitual event. It is talking about what &quot;used to happen&quot;. One has a choice between making this explicit with the expression &quot;used to,&quot; as in (4), or using the simple past and allowing the context to make it clear what we mean, as in (3). In Spanish, these would be in the imperfect, optionally with the auxiliary verb &quot;soler&quot;.

In (5), only the simple past is possible. It is talking about a single event presented as occurring at a specific point in time (the moment John pulled back the curtain). The action starts and ends with this sentence. In Spanish, this would be in the preterite (or alternatively in the perfect, if the event has only just happened).

====Further examples====
*&quot;Cuando tenía quince años, me atropelló un coche&quot; = &quot;When I was fifteen years old, a car ran over me&quot;
The imperfect is used for &quot;was&quot; in Spanish because it forms the background to the specific event expressed by &quot;ran over&quot;, which is in the preterite.
*&quot;Mientras cruzaba/estaba cruzando la calle, me atropelló un coche&quot; = &quot;While I crossed/was crossing the road, a car ran over me&quot;
In both languages, the continuous form for action in progress is optional, but Spanish requires the verb in either case to be in the imperfect, because it is the background to the specific event expressed by &quot;ran over&quot;, in the preterite.
*&quot;Siempre tenía cuidado cuando cruzaba la calle&quot; = &quot;I was always/always used to be careful when I crossed/used to cross the road&quot;
The imperfect is used for both verbs since they refer to habits in the past. Either verb could optionally use the expression &quot;used to&quot; in English.
*&quot;Me bañaba&quot; = &quot;I took baths&quot;
The preterite is used if this refers to a single action or event—that is, the person took a bath last night.
*&quot;Me bañé&quot; = &quot;I took a bath&quot;
The imperfect is used if this refers to any sort of habitual action—that is, the person took a bath every morning. Optionally, &quot;solía bañarme&quot; can specifically express &quot;I used to take baths&quot;.
*&quot;Tuvo una hija&quot; = &quot;She had a daughter&quot;
The preterite is used if this refers to an event—here, a birth.
*&quot;Tenía una hija&quot; = &quot;She had a/one daughter&quot;
The imperfect is used if this refers to the number of children by a certain point, as in &quot;She had one daughter when I met her ten years ago; she may have more now&quot;. A description.

Note that when describing the life of someone who is now dead, the distinction between the two tenses blurs. One might describe the person&#x27;s life saying &quot;tenía una hija&quot;, but &quot;tuvo una hija&quot; is very common because the person&#x27;s whole life is viewed as a whole, with a beginning and an end. The same goes for &quot;vivía/vivió en...&quot; &quot;he lived in...&quot;.

Perhaps the verb that English speakers find most difficult to translate properly is &quot;to be&quot; in the past tense (&quot;was&quot;). Apart from the choice between the verbs &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot; (see below), it is often very hard for English speakers to distinguish between contextual and narrative uses.
*&quot;Alguien cogió mis CD. ¿Quién fue?&quot; = &quot;Someone took my CDs. Who was it?&quot;
Here the preterite is used because it is an event. A good clue is the tense in which &quot;cogió&quot; is.
*&quot;Había una persona que miraba los CD. ¿Quién era?&quot; = &quot;There was a person who was looking at the CDs. Who was it?&quot;
Here the imperfect is used because it is a description (the start and end of the action is not presented; it is something that was in progress at a certain time). Again, a good clue is the tense of the other verbs.

===Contrasting the preterite and the perfect===
The preterite and the perfect are distinguished in a similar way as the equivalent English tenses. Generally, whenever the present perfect (&quot;I have done&quot;) is used in English, the perfect is also used in Spanish. In addition, there are cases in which English uses a simple past (&quot;I did&quot;) but Spanish requires a perfect. In the remaining cases, both languages use a simple past.

As in English, the perfect expresses past actions that have some link to the present. The preterite expresses past actions as being past, complete and done with. In both languages, there are dialectal variations.

====Frame of reference includes the present: perfect====
If it is implicitly or explicitly communicated that the frame of reference for the event includes the present and the event or events may therefore continue occurring, then both languages strongly prefer the perfect.
;With references including &quot;this&quot; including the present:
*&quot;Este año me he ido de vacaciones dos veces&quot; = &quot;This year I have gone on vacation twice&quot;
*&quot;Esta semana ha sido muy interesante&quot; = &quot;This week has been very interesting&quot;
;With other references to recent periods including the present:
*&quot;No he hecho mucho hoy&quot; = &quot;I have not done much today&quot;
*&quot;No ha pasado nada hasta la fecha&quot; = &quot;Nothing has happened to date&quot;
*&quot;Hasta ahora no se me ha ocurrido&quot; = &quot;Until now it has not occurred to me&quot;
;With reference to someone&#x27;s life experience (his/her life not being over):
*&quot;¿Alguna vez has estado en África?&quot; = &quot;Have you ever been in Africa?&quot;
*&quot;Mi vida no ha sido muy interesante&quot; = &quot;My life has not been very interesting&quot;
*&quot;Jamás he robado nada&quot; = &quot;Never have I stolen anything&quot;

====Frame of reference superficially includes the present: perfect====
Sometimes expressions like &quot;today&quot;, &quot;this year&quot;, and &quot;this week&quot; are used to express the idea these periods are over. This requires the simple past in English. For example, in December one might speak of the year in the simple past because we are assuming that all of that year&#x27;s important events have occurred and one can talk as though it were over. Other expressions—such as &quot;this weekend&quot;, if today is Monday—refer to a period which is definitely over; the word &quot;this&quot; just distinguishes it from other weekends. There is a tendency in Spanish to use the perfect even for this type of time reference, even though the preterite is possible and seems more logical.
*&quot;Este fin de semana hemos ido al zoo&quot; = &quot;This weekend we went to the zoo&quot;
*&quot;Hoy he tenido una jornada muy aburrida&quot; = &quot;Today I had a very boring day at work&quot;

====Consequences continue into the present: perfect====
As in English, the perfect is used when the consequences of an event are referred to.
*&quot;Alguien ha roto esta ventana&quot; = &quot;Someone has broken this window&quot; (the window is currently in a broken state)
*&quot;Nadie me ha dicho qué pasó aquel día&quot; = &quot;Nobody has told me what happened that day&quot; (therefore, I still do not know)
These same sentences in the preterite would purely refer to the past actions, without any implication that they have repercussions now.

In English, this type of perfect is not possible if a precise time frame is added or even implied. One cannot say &quot;I have been born in 1978,&quot; because the date requires &quot;I was born,&quot; despite the fact there is arguably a present consequence in the fact that the person is still alive. Spanish sporadically uses the perfect in these cases.
*&quot;He nacido en 1978&quot; (usually &quot;Nací en 1978&quot;) = &quot;I was born in 1978&quot;
*&quot;Me he criado en Madrid&quot; (usually &quot;Me crié en Madrid&quot;) = &quot;I grew up in Madrid&quot;

====The event itself continues into the present: perfect or present====
If the event itself has been happening recently and is also happening right now or expected to continue happening soon, then the preterite is impossible in both languages. English requires the perfect, or better yet the perfect continuous. Spanish requires the perfect, or better yet the present simple:
*&quot;Últimamente ha llovido mucho&quot; / &quot;Últimamente llueve mucho&quot; = &quot;It has rained / It has been raining a lot recently&quot;
This is the only use of the perfect that is common in colloquial speech across Latin America.

====Dialectal variation====
In the Canary Islands and across Latin America, there is a colloquial tendency to replace most uses of the perfect with the preterite. This use varies according to region, register, and education.
* &quot;¿Y vos alguna vez estuviste allá?&quot; = &quot;¿Y tú alguna vez has estado allí?&quot; = &quot;And have you ever been there?&quot;

The one use of the perfect that does seem to be normal in Latin America is the perfect for actions that continue into the present (not just the time frame, but the action itself). Therefore, &quot;I have read a lot in my life&quot; and &quot;I read a lot this morning&quot; would both be expressed with &quot;leí&quot; instead of &quot;he leído&quot;, but &quot;I have been reading&quot; is expressed by &quot;he leído&quot;.

A less standard use of the perfect is found in Ecuador and Colombia. It is used with present or occasionally even future meaning. For example, Shakira Mebarak in her song &quot;Ciega, Sordomuda&quot; sings,
*&quot;Bruta, ciega, sordomuda, / torpe, traste, testaruda; / es todo lo que he sido&quot; = &quot;Clumsy, blind, dumb, / blundering, useless, pig-headed; / that is all that I had been&quot;
===Contrasting the subjunctive and the imperative===

The subjunctive mood expresses wishes and hypothetical events. It is often employed together with a conditional verb:

*&quot;Desearía que estuvieses aquí.&quot; = &quot;I wish that you were here.&quot;
*&quot;Me alegraría mucho si volvieras mañana.&quot; = &quot;I would be very glad if you came back tomorrow.&quot;

The imperative mood shows commands given to the hearer (the second person). There is no imperative form in the third person, so the subjunctive is used. The expression takes the form of a command or wish directed at the hearer, but referring to the third person. The difference between a command and a wish is subtle, mostly conveyed by the absence of a wishing verb:

*&quot;Que venga el gerente.&quot; = &quot;Let the manager come.&quot;, &quot;Have the manager come.&quot;
*&quot;Que se cierren las puertas.&quot; = &quot;Let the doors be closed.&quot;, &quot;Have the doors closed.&quot;

With a verb that expresses wishing, the above sentences become plain subjunctive instead of direct commands:

*&quot;Deseo que venga el gerente.&quot; = &quot;I wish for the manager to come.&quot;
*&quot;Quiero que se cierren las puertas.&quot; = &quot;I want the doors (to be) closed.&quot;

===Contrasting the present and the future subjunctive===

The future tense of the subjunctive is found mostly in old literature or legal language and is even misused in conversation by confusing it with the past tense (often due to the similarity of its characteristic suffix, &quot;-ere&quot;, as opposed to the suffixes of the past tense, &quot;-era&quot; and &quot;-ese&quot;). It is very rare otherwise.

It survives in the common expression &quot;sea lo que fuere&quot; and the proverb &quot;allá donde fueres, haz lo que vieres&quot; (&quot;allá donde&quot; can be replaced by &quot;a la tierra donde&quot; or &quot;si a Roma&quot;).

The proverb illustrates how it used to be used:
*With &quot;si&quot; referring to the future, as in &quot;si a Roma fueres...&quot;. This is now expressed with the present indicative: &quot;si vas a Roma...&quot; or &quot;si fueras a Roma...&quot;
*With &quot;cuando&quot;, &quot;donde&quot;, and the like, referring to the future, as in &quot;allá donde fueres...&quot;. This is now expressed with the present subjunctive: &quot;vayas adonde vayas...&quot;

===Contrasting the preterite and the past anterior===

The past anterior is rare nowadays and restricted to formal use. It expresses a very fine nuance: the fact that an action occurs just after another (had) occurred, with words such as &quot;cuando&quot;, &quot;nada más&quot;, and &quot;en cuanto&quot; (&quot;when&quot;, &quot;no sooner&quot;, &quot;as soon as&quot;). In English, one must use either the simple past or the past perfect; Spanish has something specific between the two.
*&quot;En cuanto el delincuente hubo salido del cuarto, la víctima se echó a llorar&quot; = &quot;As soon as the criminal (had) left the room, the victim burst into tears&quot;

The use of &quot;hubo salido&quot; shows that the second action happened immediately after the first. &quot;Salió&quot; might imply that it happened at the same time, and &quot;había salido&quot; might imply it happened some time after.

However, colloquial Spanish has lost this tense and the corresponding nuance, and the preterite must be used instead in all but the most formal of writing.

===Contrasting &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot;===
The differences between &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot; are considered one of the most difficult concepts for non-native speakers. Both &quot;ser&quot; and &quot;estar&quot; translate into English as &quot;to be&quot;, but they have different uses, depending on whether they are used with nouns, with adjectives, with past participles (more precisely, &quot;passive&quot; participles), or to express location. 

Only &quot;ser&quot; is used to equate one noun phrase with another, and thus it is the verb for expressing a person&#x27;s occupation (&quot;Mi hermano es estudiante&quot;/&quot;My brother is a student&quot;). For the same reason, &quot;ser&quot; is used for telling the date or the time, regardless of whether the subject is explicit (&quot;Hoy es miércoles&quot;/&quot;Today is Wednesday&quot;) or merely implied (&quot;Son las ocho&quot;/&quot;It&#x27;s eight o&#x27;clock&quot;). 

When these verbs are used with adjectives, the difference between them may be generalized by saying that &quot;ser&quot; expresses nature and &quot;estar&quot; expresses state. Frequently—although not always—adjectives used with &quot;ser&quot; express a permanent quality, while their use with &quot;estar&quot; expresses a temporary situation. There are exceptions to the generalization; for example, the sentence &quot;Tu mamá está loca&quot; (&quot;Your mother is crazy&quot;) can express either a temporary or a permanent state of craziness.

&quot;Ser&quot; generally focuses on the essence of the subject, and specifically on qualities that include:
# Nationality
# Possession
# Physical and personality traits
# Material
# Origin

&quot;Estar&quot; generally focuses on the condition of the subject, and specifically on qualities that include:
# Physical condition
# Feelings, emotions, and states of mind
# Appearance

In English, the sentence &quot;The boy is boring&quot; uses a different adjective than &quot;The boy is bored&quot;. In Spanish, the difference is made by the choice of &quot;ser&quot; or &quot;estar&quot;.
*&quot;El chico es aburrido&quot; uses &quot;ser&quot; to express a permanent trait (&quot;The boy is boring&quot;).
*&quot;El chico está aburrido&quot; uses &quot;estar&quot; to express a temporary state of mind (&quot;The boy is bored&quot;).

The same strategy is used with many adjectives to express either an inherent trait (&quot;ser&quot;) or a transitory state or condition (&quot;estar&quot;). For example: 
*&quot;María es guapa&quot; uses &quot;ser&quot; to express an essential trait, meaning &quot;María is a good-looking person.&quot;
*&quot;María está guapa&quot; uses &quot;estar&quot; to express a momentary impression: &quot;María looks beautiful&quot; (a comment on her present appearance, without any implication about her inherent characteristics).

When &quot;ser&quot; is used with the past participle of a verb, it forms the &quot;true&quot; passive voice, expressing an event (&quot;El libro fue escrito en 2005&quot;/&quot;The book was written in 2005&quot;). When the past participle appears with &quot;estar&quot;, it forms a &quot;passive of result&quot; or &quot;stative passive&quot; (&quot;El libro ya está escrito&quot;/&quot;The book is already written&quot;—see Spanish conjugation).

Location of a person or thing is expressed with &quot;estar&quot;—regardless of whether temporary or permanent (&quot;El hotel está en la esquina&quot;/&quot;The hotel is on the corner&quot;). Location of an event is expressed with &quot;ser&quot; (&quot;La reunión es en el hotel&quot;/&quot;The meeting is [takes place] in the hotel&quot;).

===Contrasting &quot;haber&quot; and &quot;tener&quot;===

The verbs &quot;haber&quot; and &quot;tener&quot; are easily distinguished, but they may pose a problem for learners of Spanish who speak other Romance languages (where the cognates of &quot;haber&quot; and &quot;tener&quot; are used differently), for English speakers (where &quot;have&quot; is used as a verb and as an auxiliary), and others. &quot;Haber&quot; derives from Latin &quot;habeō&quot;, with the basic meaning of &quot;to have&quot;. &quot;Tener&quot; derives from Latin &quot;teneō&quot;, with the basic meaning of &quot;to hold&quot;, &quot;to keep&quot;. As &quot;habeō&quot; began to degrade and become reduced to just ambiguous monosyllables in the present tense, the Iberian Romance languages (Spanish, Gallician-Portuguese, and Catalan) restricted its use and started to use &quot;teneō&quot; as the ordinary verb expressing having and possession. 

====&quot;Haber&quot;: expressing existence====
&quot;Haber&quot; can be used as an impersonal verb expressing existence (&quot;there is/are&quot;). When used impersonally, &quot;haber&quot; has a special present-tense form: &quot;hay&quot; instead of &quot;ha&quot;. The &quot;y&quot; is presumed to be a fossilized form of the mediaeval Castilian clitic pronoun &quot;y&quot; or &quot;i&quot;, once meaning &quot;there&quot;, but now semantically empty, historically cognate with French &quot;y&quot;, Catalan &quot;hi&quot; and Italian &quot;vi&quot; from Latin &quot;ibi&quot;.

Unlike in English, in standard Spanish the thing that &quot;is there&quot; is not the subject of the sentence, and therefore there is no agreement between it and the verb (there is often agreement though in dialectal Spanish). This echoes constructions seen in languages such as French (&quot;il y a&quot; = &quot;it there has&quot;), Catalan (&quot;hi ha&quot; = &quot;[it] there has&quot;), and even Chinese (有 &quot;yǒu&quot; = &quot;[it] has&quot;):

*&quot;Hay un gato en el jardín.&quot; = &quot;There is a cat in the garden.&quot;
*&quot;En el baúl hay fotografías viejas.&quot; = &quot;In the trunk there are some old photos.&quot;

To form perfect constructions, the past participle &quot;habido&quot; is used:

* &quot;Ha habido mucha confusión de esto.&quot; = &quot;There&#x27;s been a lot of confusion about this.&quot;
* &quot;Ha habido pocos hasta ahora.&quot; = &quot;There have been few so far.&quot;

It is possible, in certain types of emphasis, to put the verb after the object:

*&quot;¿Revistas hay?&quot; = &quot;Are there any magazines?&quot;

There is a tendency to make &quot;haber&quot; agree with what follows, as though it were the subject, particularly in tenses other than the present indicative. There is heavier stigma on inventing plural forms for &quot;hay&quot;, but &quot;hain&quot;, &quot;han&quot;, and suchlike are sometimes encountered in non-standard speech. The form &quot;habemos&quot; is common (meaning &quot;there are, including me&quot;); it very rarely replaces &quot;hemos&quot; to form the present perfect tense in modern language, and in certain contexts it is even acceptable in formal or literary language:

*&quot;Había un hombre en la casa.&quot; = &quot;There was a man in the house.&quot;
*&quot;Había unos hombres en la casa.&quot; = &quot;There were some men in the house.&quot; (standard)
*&quot;Habían unos hombres en la casa.&quot; = &quot;There were some men in the house.&quot; (non-standard)
*&quot;En esta casa habemos cinco personas.&quot; = &quot;In this house there are five of us.&quot; (non-standard)
*&quot;Habría habido muchos más si supiera.&quot; = &quot;There would have been a lot more if I knew.&quot; (standard)
*&quot;Nos las habemos con un gran jugador.&quot; = &quot;We are confronting a great player.&quot; (standard)

As an existential verb, &quot;haber&quot; is never used other than in the third person. To express the existence of a first or second person, the verb &quot;estar&quot; (&quot;to be [located/present]&quot;) or &quot;existir&quot; (&quot;to exist&quot;) is used, and there is subject–verb agreement.

====&quot;Haber&quot;: impersonal obligation====
The phrase &quot;haber que&quot; (in the third person singular and followed by a subordinated construction with the verb in the infinitive) carries the meaning of necessity or obligation without specifying an agent. It is translatable as &quot;it is necessary&quot;, but a paraphrase is generally preferable in translation. Note that the present-tense form is &quot;hay&quot;.

*&quot;Hay que abrir esa puerta.&quot; = &quot;That door needs opening&quot;, &quot;We have to open that door&quot;.
*&quot;Habrá que abrir esa puerta.&quot; = &quot;That door will need opening&quot;, &quot;We are going to have to open that door&quot;.
*&quot;Aunque haya que abrir esa puerta.&quot; = &quot;Even if that door needs to be opened&quot;.

This construction is comparable to French &quot;il faut&quot; and Catalan &quot;cal&quot;. &quot;Hay que&quot; always goes with the infinitive.

====&quot;Haber&quot;: personal obligation====
A separate construction is &quot;haber de&quot; + infinitive. It is not impersonal. It tends to express a certain nuance of obligation and a certain nuance of future tense, much like the expression &quot;to be to&quot;. It is also often used similarly to &quot;tener que&quot; and &quot;deber&quot; (&quot;must&quot;, &quot;ought to&quot;). Note that the third personal singular of the present tense is &quot;ha&quot;.

*&quot;Mañana he de dar una charla ante la Universidad&quot; = &quot;Tomorrow I am to give a speech before the University&quot;.
*&quot;Ha de comer más verduras&quot; = &quot;She/he ought to eat more vegetables&quot;.

====&quot;Haber&quot;: forming the perfect====
&quot;Haber&quot; is also used as an auxiliary to form the perfect, as shown elsewhere. Spanish uses only &quot;haber&quot; for this, unlike French and Italian, which use the corresponding cognates of &quot;haber&quot; for most verbs, but cognates of &quot;ser&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) for certain others.

*&quot;Ella se ha ido al mercado&quot; = &quot;She has gone to the market&quot;
*&quot;Ellas se han ido de paseo&quot; = &quot;They have gone on a walk&quot;
*&quot;¿Habéis fregado los platos?&quot; = &quot;Have you (all) done the washing-up?&quot;

====&quot;Tener&quot;====
&quot;Tener&quot; is a verb with the basic meaning of &quot;to have&quot;, in its essential sense of &quot;to possess&quot;, &quot;to hold&quot;, &quot;to own&quot;. As in English, it can also express obligation (&quot;tener que&quot; + infinitive). It also appears in a number of phrases that show emotion or physical states, expressed by nouns, which in English tend to be expressed by &quot;to be&quot; and an adjective.

*&quot;Mi hijo tiene una casa nueva&quot; = &quot;My son has a new house&quot;
*&quot;Tenemos que hablar&quot; = &quot;We have to talk&quot;
*&quot;Tengo hambre&quot; = &quot;I am hungry&quot; (lit. &quot;I have hunger&quot;)

There are numerous phrases like &quot;tener hambre&quot; that are not literally translated in English, such as:
*&quot;tener hambre&quot; = &quot;to be hungry&quot;; &quot;to have hunger&quot;
*&quot;tener sed&quot; = &quot;to be thirsty&quot;; &quot;to have thirst&quot;
*&quot;tener cuidado&quot; = &quot;to be careful&quot;; &quot;to have caution&quot;
*&quot;tener __ años&quot; = &quot;to be __ years old&quot;; &quot;to have __ years&quot;
*&quot;tener celos&quot; = &quot;to be jealous&quot;; &quot;to have jealousy&quot;
*&quot;tener éxito&quot; = &quot;to be successful&quot;; &quot;to have success&quot;
*&quot;tener vergüenza&quot; = &quot;to be ashamed&quot;; &quot;to have shame&quot;

Note: &quot;Estar hambriento&quot; is a literal translation of &quot;To be hungry&quot;, but it is rarely used in Spanish nowadays.
===Negation===

Verbs are negated by putting &quot;no&quot; before the verb.
Other negative words can either replace this &quot;no&quot; or occur after the verb:
*&quot;Hablo español&quot; = &quot;I speak Spanish&quot;
*&quot;No hablo español&quot; = &quot;I do not speak Spanish&quot;
*&quot;Nunca hablo español&quot; = &quot;I never speak Spanish&quot;
*&quot;No hablo nunca español&quot; = &quot;I do not ever speak Spanish&quot;

===Expressing movement===

Spanish verbs describing motion tend to emphasize direction instead of manner of motion. According to the pertinent classification, this makes Spanish a verb-framed language. This contrasts with English, where verbs tend to emphasize manner, and the direction of motion is left to helper particles, prepositions, or adverbs.

*&quot;We drove away&quot; = &quot;Nos fuimos en coche&quot; (lit. &quot;We went (away) by car&quot;)
*&quot;He swam to Ibiza&quot; = &quot;Fue a Ibiza nadando&quot; (lit. &quot;He went to Ibiza swimming&quot;)
*&quot;They ran off&quot; = &quot;Huyeron corriendo&quot; (lit. &quot;They fled running&quot;)
*&quot;She crawled in&quot; = &quot;Entró a gatas&quot; (lit. &quot;She entered on all fours&quot;)

Quite often, the important thing is the direction, not the manner. Therefore, although &quot;we drove away&quot; translates into Spanish as &quot;nos fuimos en coche&quot;, it is often better to translate it as just &quot;nos fuimos&quot;. For example:

==Verbal nouns==
Spanish verbal nouns (e.g. &quot;running&quot;, &quot;coming&quot;, &quot;thinking&quot; in English) are identical in form to the infinitive of the verb from which they are derived, and their gender is masculine. They are generally used with the definite article, and enclitic pronouns attach to them as they would to a normal infinitive. Thus:

* &quot;el comer&quot; = &quot;eating&quot;
* &quot;el correr&quot; = &quot;running&quot;
* &quot;el no esperar&quot; = &quot;not waiting&quot;
* &quot;el darte un libro&quot; = &quot;giving you a book&quot;
* &quot;el guardárselos&quot; = &quot;saving them (m.) for him/her/them/you (formal)&quot;

<text>Vote splitting is an electoral effect in which the distribution of votes among multiple similar candidates reduces the chance of winning for any of the similar candidates, and increases the chance of winning for a dissimilar candidate. This is commonly known as the spoiler effect, which can discourage minor party candidacies.

Vote splitting most easily occurs in plurality voting (also called first-past-the-post) in which each voter indicates a single choice and the candidate with the most votes wins, even if the winner does not have majority support. For example, if candidate A1 receives 30% of the votes, similar candidate A2 receives another 30% of the votes, and dissimilar candidate B receives the remaining 40% of the votes, plurality voting declares candidate B as the winner, even though 60% of the voters prefer either candidate A1 or A2.

== Occurrence ==
One of the main functions of political parties is to mitigate the effect of spoiler-prone voting methods by winnowing on a local level the contenders before the election. Each party nominates at most one candidate per office since each party expects to lose if they nominate more than one. This means empirical observations of the frequency of spoiled elections may not be a good measure, because they exclude relevant information from candidates who chose not to run.

Vote splitting occurs when candidates or ballot questions have similar ideologies. A spoiler candidate can draw votes from a major candidate with similar politics, thereby causing a strong opponent of both or several to win. The minor candidates causing this effect are referred to as spoilers.

The problem also exists in two-round system and instant-runoff voting, though it is reduced, because weaker spoilers are eliminated. All ranked-choice systems suffer from variations of the spoiler effect, according to Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem. However, a candidate that can win head-to-head against all rivals (called a Condorcet winner) can still lose from third place in a 3-way vote split, a phenomenon known as a center squeeze. This occurred in the 2009 Burlington Vermont mayoral election and the 2022 Alaska&#x27;s at-large congressional district special election.

==Election examples by country==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, seats where vote splitting occurs are called &quot;three-corned contests&quot;. While the vote is split in a three-cornered contest, it is not always a disadvantage as Australia uses preferential voting. However, depending on the level of government it can still act as a disadvantage due to the different forms of preferential voting used in Australia; full preferential voting (FPV) is used on a federal level and in some states and territories while optional preferential voting (OPV) is used in New South Wales. Due to this, three-cornered contests are rare in New South Wales (on both a state and federal level) as well as in the federal Senate.

Three-cornered contests generally occur with the centre-right Liberal-National Coalition. However, the frequency of these contests varies in different states and it does not occur in the Queensland, Tasmania or the two territories, due to the fact that the Nationals do not exist in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and they do not currently contest elections in Tasmania, while in Queensland and the Northern Territory the two Coalition parties merged to become the Liberal National Party (LNP) and the CLP, respectively. While they are rare in New South Wales, three-cornered contests do often occur in Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia.

==== Federal politics ====

Federally, three-cornered contests are uncommon in most seats. However, they do occur in certain regional seats. At the 2022 federal election, both Coalition parties ran candidates in four seats; two in Victoria (Division of Indi, Nicholls), one in Western Australia (Durack) and one in South Australia (Barker). The number of federal seats with three-cornered contests has dropped over the years. In fact, there was a significantly low number of three-cornered contests in 2022, even when compared to the previous federal election, which was held in 2019. In that election, both Coalition parties ran candidates in ten seats; two in New South Wales (Eden-Monaro and Gilmore), two in Victoria (Indi and Mallee), two in Western Australia (Durack and O&#x27;Connor), one in South Australia (Barker) and three in Tasmania (Bass, Braddon and Lyons).

==== State politics ====
In New South Wales (the only state where the Coalition has never been broken), three-cornered contests are rare as most Coalition voters exhaust their preferences (meaning they only number one candidate, thus being a disadvantage except in conservative strongholds on the Mid North Coast and in central and western parts of the state). However, at the 2023 state election, this phenomenon did occur in two regional seats: Port Macquarie (a conservative seat held by National-turned-Liberal MP Leslie Williams) and Wagga Wagga (a traditionally conservative seat, despite being held by independent MP Joe McGirr). In Port Macquarie, Williams was the Liberal candidate and Peta Pinson, the Mayor of the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council, was the Nationals candidate. Williams won the seat, which despite having a three-cornered contest remained a safe seat on both two-candidate-preferred (TCP) and two-party-preferred (TPP) margin. In Wagga Wagga, the Nationals candidate was Adrianna Benjamin and the Liberal candidate was Julia Ham. McGirr retained the seat with an increased TCP margin against Benjamin, although the Nationals still won the TPP count. It is unlikely that a three-cornered contest will occur in either of these seats at the next state election, which will be held in 2027.

In Victoria, three-cornered contests occur in some seats, despite the Coalition existing in Victoria (although it has previously been broken). At the 2022 state election, both Coalition parties ran candidates in five seats (Bass, Euroa, Mildura, Morwell and Shepparton). The Nationals intended to run a candidate in the Narracan, but the candidate they preselected died before the election, forcing a supplementary by-election in that seat, in which the Liberal candidate was re-elected and the Nationals did not run a candidate.

In Western Australia, three-cornered contests do commonly occur. This is due to the fact that the Coalition agreement is different in that both parties are independent of each other and each party can vote differently if they believe that their decision it is in the best interests of the people and areas they represent. The Nationals can also opt-out of Cabinet and when a Coalition government is elected, the leader of the Liberal Party becomes the state Premier, but the leader of the Nationals does not always become the Deputy Premier, unlike in New South Wales and Victoria where in the event of a Coalition government, the Liberal leader becomes the Premier and the Nationals leader becomes the Deputy Premier. For example, following the 2008 state election, which saw a Coalition government elected, the Liberal leader (Colin Barnett) became the Premier, but the Nationals leader (Brendon Grylls) did not become the Deputy Premier, an office that the deputy Liberal leader (Kim Hames) was given instead.

In South Australia, three-cornered-contests do occur in some seats, due to the absence of the Coalition. In most states, the Liberal Party holds seats in cities while the Nationals hold seats in regional, rural and remote areas, but in South Australia and Tasmania, the Nationals have limited activity and thus the Liberals hold both metropolitan and non-metropolitan seats in these states. At the 2022 state election, both the Liberals and the Nationals ran candidates in eight seats (Chaffey, Finniss, Flinders, Frome, Hammond, MacKillop, Narungga and Schubert). Due to the limited activity of the party, the Nationals finished last or close-to-last in all of these seats, even being outvoted by some minor parties and winning a statewide vote of just 0.48%, the lowest in the country on a state level (excluding states the party does not contest elections in).

In Australia, the 1918 Swan by-election saw the conservative vote split between the Country Party and Nationalist Party, which allowed the Australian Labor Party to win the seat. That led the Nationalist government to implement preferential voting in federal elections to allow Country and Nationalist voters to transfer preferences to the other party and to avoid vote splitting. Today, the Liberal Party and National Party rarely run candidates in the same seats, which are known as three-cornered contests. When three-cornered contests do occur the Labor Party would usually direct preferences to the Liberals ahead of the Nationals as they considered the Liberal Party to be less conservative than the Nationals. The 1996 Southern Highlands state by-election in New South Wales is an example of this when the Nationals candidate Katrina Hodgkinson won the primary vote but was defeated after preferences to Liberal candidate Peta Seaton when Seaton received Labor Party preferences.

=== Bulgaria ===

In 2001, the former tsar of Bulgaria Simeon II founded the NDSV. The NDSV won exactly 50% of the seats (120 out of 240 seats) thus barely missing an outright majority. Similarly named parties &quot;Simeon II&quot; Coalition, &quot;National Union for Tsar Simeon II&quot;, &quot;National Union Tsar Kiro&quot; Coalition and &quot;National Movement for New Era&quot; (NDNE) got 3.44%, 1.70%, 0.60% and 0.05% respectively.

In Bulgaria, the so-called &quot;blue parties&quot; or &quot;urban right&quot; which include SDS, DSB, Yes, Bulgaria!, DBG, ENP, Coalition For you Bulgaria and Blue Unity frequently get just above or below the electoral threshold depending on formation of electoral alliances: In the EP election 2007, DSB (4.74%) and SDS (4.35%) were campaigning separately and both fell below the natural electoral of around 5 percent. In 2009 Bulgarian parliamentary election, DSB and SDS ran together as Blue Coalition gaining 6.76 percent. In 2013 Bulgarian parliamentary election, campaigning separately DGB received 3.25 percent, DSB 2.93 percent, SDS 1.37 percent and ENP 0.17 percent, thus all of them failed to cross the threshold this even led to a tie between the former opposition and the parties right of the centre. In the EP election 2014, SDS, DSB and DBG ran as Reformist Bloc gaining 6.45 percent and crossing the electoral threshold, while Blue Unity campaigned separately and did not cross the electoral threshold. In 2017 Bulgarian parliamentary election, SDS and DBG ran as Reformist Bloc gaining 3.14 percent, &quot;Yes, Bulgaria!&quot; received 2.96 percent, DSB 2.54 percent, thus all of them failed to cross the electoral threshold. In the EP election 2019, &quot;Yes, Bulgaria!&quot; and DBG ran together as Democratic Bulgaria and crossed the electoral threshold with 6.15 percent. In November 2021, electoral alliance Democratic Bulgaria crossed electoral threshold with 6.37 percent.

=== Canada ===
When the cities of Fort William and Port Arthur merged and (in 1969) voted on a name for the new town, the vote was split between the popular choices of &quot;Lakehead&quot; and &quot;The Lakehead&quot;, allowing the third option to win, creating the town of Thunder Bay, Ontario.

From 1993 to 2004, the conservative vote in Canada was split between the Progressive Conservatives and the Reform (later the Alliance) Party. That allowed the Liberal Party to win almost all seats in Ontario and to win three successive majority governments.

The 2015 provincial election in Alberta saw the left-wing New Democratic Party win 62% of the seats with 40.6% of the province&#x27;s popular vote after a division within the right-wing Progressive Conservative Party, which left it with only 27.8% of the vote, and its breakaway movement, the Wildrose Party, with 24.2% of the vote. In 2008, the last election in which the Progressive Conservative Party had been unified, it won 52.72% of the popular vote. The Progressive Conservatives had won every provincial election since the 1971 election, making them the longest-serving provincial government in Canadian history—being in office for 44 years. This was only the fourth change of government in Alberta since Alberta became a province in 1905, and one of the worst defeats a provincial government has suffered in Canada. It also marked the first time in almost 80 years that a left-of-centre political party had formed government in Alberta since the defeat of the United Farmers of Alberta in 1935 and the Depression-era radical monetary reform policies of William Aberhart&#x27;s Social Credit government. During the 2021 Canadian federal election, it is speculated that the People&#x27;s Party of Canada might have coast the CPC up to 24 seats.

In Canada, vote splits between the two major left-of-centre parties (Liberals and NDP) assisted the Conservative Party in winning the 2006, 2008, and 2011 federal elections, despite most of the popular vote going to left-wing parties in each race. During the 2022 Ontario General Election, Progressive Conservative Doug Ford won a second term as Premier of the Province of Ontario. The Progressive Conservatives won several ridings due to vote splitting. ONDP and Liberal Party voters combined for 47.8% of votes, whereas Ford emerged victorious with only 40.82% of total votes.

=== Czech Republic ===
In 2021, Přísaha (4.68%), ČSSD (4.65%) and KSČM (3.60%) all failed to cross the 5 percent threshold, thus allowing a coalition of Spolu and PaS. This was also the first time that neither ČSSD nor KSČM had representation in parliament since 1992.

=== France ===
In France, the 2002 presidential elections have been cited as a case of the spoiler effect: the numerous left-wing candidates, such as Christiane Taubira and Jean-Pierre Chevènement, both from political parties allied to the French Socialist Party, or the three candidates from Trotskyist parties, which altogether totalled around 20%, have been charged with making Lionel Jospin, the Socialist Party candidate, lose the two-round election in the first round to the benefit of Jean-Marie Le Pen, who was separated from Jospin by only 0.68%. Some also cite the case of some districts in which the moderate right and the far right had more than half of the votes together, but the left still won the election; they accuse the left of profiting from the split. Also in the presidential elections 1969 (with five left-wing candidates which combined had 32%), in 2017 (split between four candidates which had 27% combined) and in 2022 (six left-wing candidates with 32% combined), the left failed to reach the run-off which may be traced back the amount of left-of-centre candidates. Similarly in the 1993 parliamentary election, where the green parties ran against the parties of the presidential majority. This led to many right-wing run-offs and the most right-wing dominated parliament since 1968.

In the 2023 French Polynesian legislative election, the anti-separatist A here ia Porinetia did not form an alliance with the Tāpura Huiraʻatira allowing the separatist Tāvini Huiraʻatira to win the run-off with just 44%.

In the 2009 European Parliament election, two right-wing sovereignist lists Libertas France and Debout la République (DLR) competed against each other. Libertas and DLR failed to cross 5% threshold in all but one constituency. Similar vote splitting happened between the two (post-)Trotskyist parties New Anticapitalist Party and Lutte Ouvrière. A similar scenario happened in 2019, when after failed negotiations Debout la France–CNIP (the former previously known as DLR), Popular Republican Union (UPR) and The Patriots ran independently and gained 3.5%, 1.2% and 0.6% respectively thus falling below the newly introduced national threshold of 5%.

=== Germany ===
In the German presidential election of 1925, Communist Ernst Thälmann refused to withdraw his candidacy although it was extremely unlikely that he would have won, and the leadership of the Communist International urged him not to run. In the second (and final) round of balloting, Thälmann shared 1,931,151 votes (6.4%). Centre Party candidate Wilhelm Marx, backed by pro-republican parties, won 13,751,605 (45.3%). The right-wing candidate Paul von Hindenburg won 14,655,641 votes (48.3%). If most of Thälmann&#x27;s supporters had voted for Marx, he likely would have won the election. That election had great significance because after 1930, Hindenburg increasingly favoured authoritarian means of government, and in 1933, he was persuaded by Von Papen to appoint Adolf Hitler to the chancellorship. Hindenburg&#x27;s death the following year gave Hitler unchecked control of the German government.

In the 1990 German federal election, the Western Greens did not meet the threshold, which was applied separately for former East and West Germany. The Greens could not take advantage of this, because the &quot;Alliance 90&quot; (which had absorbed the East German Greens) ran separately from &quot;The Greens&quot; in the West. Together, they would have narrowly passed the 5.0 percent threshold (West: 4.8%, East: 6.2%). The Western Greens returned to the Bundestag in 1994.

The post-communist PDS and its successor Die Linke often hovered around the 5 percent threshold: In 1994, it won only 4.4 percent of the party list vote, but won four districts in East Berlin, which saved it, earning 30 MPs in total. In 2002, it achieved only 4.0 percent of the party list vote, and won just two districts, this time excluding the party from proportional representation. This resulted in a narrow red-green majority and a second term for Gerhard Schröder, which would not have been possible had the PDS won a third constituency. In 2021, it won only 4.9 percent of the party list vote, but won the bare minimum of three districts (Berlin-Lichtenberg, Berlin-Treptow-Köpenick, and Leipzig II), salvaging the party, which received 39 MPs.

In the 2013 German federal election, the FDP, in Parliament since 1949, received only 4.8 percent of the list vote, and won no single district, excluding the party altogether. This, along with the failure of the right-wing eurosceptic party AfD (4.7%), gave a left-wing majority in Parliament despite a center-right majority of votes (CDU/CSU itself fell short of an absolute majority by just 5 seats). As a result, Merkel&#x27;s CDU/CSU formed a grand coalition with the SPD. 

Klimaliste has been accused of splitting the vote which would have gone to Alliance 90/The Greens. For example, in the 2021 Baden-Württemberg state election a Red-Green coalition was just a single seat short of a majority while Klimaliste missed the threshold with receiving 0.9% of the vote.

=== Greece ===
In Greece, Antonis Samaras was the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the liberal conservative government of New Democracy under Prime Minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis but ended up leaving and founding the national conservative Political Spring in response to the Macedonia naming dispute, resulting in the 1993 Greek legislative election where PASOK won with its leader Andreas Papandreou making a successful political comeback, which was considered to be responsible for the Greek government debt crisis.

=== Guatemala ===
In 2019 the different parties to the left of National Unity of Hope (Semilla, Winaq, MLP, URNG, EG, CPO-CRD and Libre) ran with their own lists and presidential candidates. Their highest candidates Thelma Cabrera and Manuel Villacorta archived 10.3% and 5.2% respectively, combined stronger than the main conservative candidate Alejandro Giammattei 13.9% (who was elected in the run-off). If they ran together there wont have been any conservative candidate in the run-off. A similar scenario happened in the 2023 election, in which four right-of-centre candidates (Manuel Conde, Armando Castillo, Edmond Mulet and Zury Ríos) gained just below 11% each, all behind Semilla&#x27;s candidate Bernardo Arévalo with around 16%.

=== Israel ===
In April 2019, among the 3 lists representing right-wing to far-right Zionism and supportive of Netanyahu, only one crossed the threshold the right-wing government had increased to 3.25 percent: the Union of the Right-Wing Parties with 3.70 percent, while future Prime Minister Bennett&#x27;s New Right narrowly failed at 3.22 percent, and Zehut only 2.74 percent, destroying Netanyahu&#x27;s chances of another majority, and leading to snap elections in September and a political gridlock lasting three years.

=== Italy ===
Sicily is traditionally dominated by the centre-right but in the 2012 Sicilian regional election the centre-right was split between Nello Musumeci, Gianfranco Micciché, Mariano Ferro and Cateno De Luca allowing the centre-left Rosario Crocetta to win the election with just 30.5%.

The Italian Left often struggled to meet thresholds after the formation of the Democratic Party, in 2008 most left-wing parties ran on the Rainbow Left list which got 3.08% but other left-wing parties, the Workers&#x27; Communist Party (PCL) with 0.57%, the Critical Left with 0.46% and the Communist Alternative Party (PdAC) with 0.01%, still split enough votes from them to fall below the 4% threshold. In 2009 three different left-wing lists competed against each other. The Federation of the Left got 3.39%, Left and Freedom got 3.13% and the PCL got 0.54%, thus all fell short of the 4% threshold. Similarly in 2019, Green Europe got 2.32% and The Left got 1.75%.

=== Norway ===
In 2009, the Liberal Party received 3.9 percent of the votes, below the 4 percent threshold for leveling seats, although still winning two seats. Hence, while right-wing opposition parties won more votes between them than the parties in the governing coalition, the narrow failure of the Liberal Party to cross the threshold kept the governing coalition in power. It crossed the threshold again at the following election with 5.2 percent.

=== Poland ===
In 2015, the United Left achieved 7.55 percent, which is below the 8 percent threshold for multi-party coalitions. Furthermore, KORWiN only reached 4.76 percent, narrowly missing the 5 percent threshold for individual parties. This allowed the victorious PiS to obtain a majority of seats with 37 percent of the vote. This was the first parliament without left-wing parties represented.

=== Philippines ===
In the 2004 Philippine presidential election, those who were opposed to Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&#x27;s presidency had their vote split into the four candidates, thereby allowing Arroyo to win. The opposition had film actor Fernando Poe, Jr. as its candidate, but Panfilo Lacson refused to give way and ran as a candidate of a breakaway faction of the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino. Arroyo was later accused of vote-rigging.

=== Romania ===
In 2000, the different candidates of the incumbent government got in the Romanian presidential election 11.8% (Stolojan), 9.5% (Isărescu), 6.2% (Frunda) and 3.0% (Roman) respectively. Combined they had more than Corneliu Vadim Tudor of the Greater Romania Party, who got 28.3% in the first round.

=== Serbia ===
In Serbia, there are often quite a few nationalist and right-wing parties, which compete independently. Since the rise of Aleksandar Vučić&#x27;s Serbian Progressive Party, which broke away from the Serbian Radical Party in 2008, vote splitting became common among them. The most extreme cases of vote splitting were in 2014, none of the nationalist lists (DSS, SRS, Dveri, Third Serbia, &quot;Patriotic Front&quot; and the Russian Party, a nominally Russian minority party) made it above 4.2% thus neither of them won seats despite having a total of 10.6%. and in 2020, the POKS (2.7%), DJB (2.3%), the DSS (2.2%) and the SRS (2.1%) alongside smaller parties all ended up below the 3% threshold, which was introduced to make it easier for parties after the main opposition alliance called for a boycott. Only the Serbian Patriotic Alliance gained 3.8% in their first and only election.
=== Slovakia ===

2002. The True Slovak National Party (PSNS) split from Slovak National Party (SNS), and Movement for Democracy (HZD) split from the previously dominant People&#x27;s Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. All of them failed to cross the 5 percent threshold with PSNS having 3.65 percent, SNS 3.33 percent and HZD 3.26 percent respectively, thus allowing a center-right coalition despite having less than 43 percent of the vote.

In 2016, the Christian Democratic Movement achieved 4.94 percent missing only 0.06 percent votes to reach the threshold after #SIEŤ split from KDH which meant the first absence of the party since the Velvet Revolution and the first democratic elections in 1990.

In 2020, Velvet Revolution in which no party of the Hungarian minority crossed the 5 percent threshold. The vote was split between Hungarian Community Togetherness with 3.9% and Most–Híd with 2.1%.

Before the 2024, Republic broke away from the People&#x27;s Party Our Slovakia (ĽSNS). Republic received 4.75% and the ĽSNS 0.84%.

=== South Korea ===
In 1987, Roh Tae-woo won the South Korean presidential election with just under 36% of the popular vote because his two main liberal rivals split the vote. A similar scenario happened when in 1997 won by just Kim Dae-jung 40.3% because his two main conservative rivals split the vote.

=== Taiwan ===
In the 2000 presidential election in Taiwan, James Soong left Kuomintang (KMT) party and ran as an independent against KMT&#x27;s candidate Lien Chan. This caused vote-splitting among KMT voters and resulted in victory for Democratic Progressive Party&#x27;s candidate, Chen Shui-bian. It is the first time in Taiwan history that the KMT did not win a presidential election, and it became the opposition party.

A similar scenario happened in 2024, when after the opposition candidates Hou Yu-ih (KMT) and Ko Wen-je (Taiwan People&#x27;s Party) failed to reached an agreement, Lai Ching-te (DPP) won with just 40 % of the vote.

=== Turkey ===
Regular military coups in the second half of the 20th century led to a situation, where two similar centre-left kemalist parties, the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP) and the Democratic Left Party (DSP), and centre-right kemalist parties, the True Path Party (DYP) and Motherland Party (ANAP), competed against another. In the 2002 general election, the centre-left (CHP, DSP, NTP) got 21.76% and the centre-right (DYP, ANAP, YP, LDP) got 15.89% but because of the split only the CHP and the new Justice and Development Party (AKP) made it above the 10% threshold with the AKP having 66% of the seats with just 34.28% of the vote. Attempts to merge ANAP and DYP before the 2007 election failed and the Democrat Party (the successor of DYP) only won 5.4%.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the 1994 European Elections, Richard Huggett stood as a &quot;Literal Democrat&quot; candidate for the Devon and East Plymouth seat, with the name playing on that of the much larger Liberal Democrats. Huggett took over 10,000 votes, and the Liberal Democrats lost by 700 votes to the Conservative Party. The Registration of Political Parties Act 1998, brought in after the election, introduced a register of political parties and ended the practice of deliberately confusing party descriptions.

In the run up to 2019 UK General Election, the Brexit Party, led by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, initially put up candidates in 600 seats after a strong showing for the newly formed party in the 2019 European Elections, but days later, he reversed his position after Conservative British Prime Minister Boris Johnson stated that he would not consider an electoral pact with the Brexit Party. That was seen as benefiting the Conservative Party and disadvantaging the Labour Party. Farage later encouraged voters not to vote for the Labour Party in areas that traditionally favoured it but voted to leave in the 2016 EU Membership Referendum but instead to vote tactically. After the Conservatives&#x27; decisive victory, it was suggested by some media outlets and political analysts that Farage had acted as &quot;kingmaker&quot; and stalking horse and effectively won the election for the Tories, as Farage&#x27;s decision avoided splitting the vote.

=== United States ===

Since 1990, the Republican Party&#x27;s presidential ticket, according to the research cited below, has benefited most from the spoiler effect of the plurality voting system that chooses electors for the electoral college. The year 2000 was an especially clear case when Al Gore would likely have won without vote splitting by one or more of the third-party tickets on the ballot. Which party benefits from a third-party ticket depends on the election and the candidates.

==== President (since 1990) ====

* The 2024 United States presidential election has seen an unusually large amount of third-party candidates which could split votes and determine the winner. Cornel West&#x27;s campaign has been noted for the support from Republicans and Trump allies to get on swing state ballots in the hopes of splitting votes away from Kamala Harris.
* For the 2016 United States presidential election and 2020 United States presidential election, some analyses have found the impact of third party candidates only on the margin of victory. Some attribute Biden’s election in 2020 to the lack of vote splitting, with studies of 2016 third-party voters showing them much more likely to vote for Biden in 2020.
* In 2000, Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, lost to George W. Bush due to a difference of 537 votes in the state of Florida. Green Party candidate and progressive Ralph Nader received 97,421 votes in Florida on a platform most similar to Gore&#x27;s. Exit polling and surveys have estimated that around 47% of Nader supporters said they would have voted for Gore if Nader didn&#x27;t run (21% Bush and 32% neither). Vote splitting has also been called the &quot;Nader Effect&quot; as a result.
* Analysis of surveys and exit poll data from the 1992 presidential election predicts Bill Clinton winning regardless of Ross Perot&#x27;s campaign though disagreements remain on which candidate lost more votes to Perot.

==== President (before 1970) ====

* In 1968, George Wallace ran for president as the American Independent Party&#x27;s nominee and was the most recent third-party candidate to win a state.
* In 1912, Progressive Party candidate Theodore Roosevelt won almost 700,000 votes more than did the Republican incumbent, William Howard Taft. After Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson won the election, many Republicans became concerned that Roosevelt might return to split the Republican Party vote again.
* In the 1884 presidential election, the Prohibition Party&#x27;s presidential nominee, former Republican Governor John St. John, took 147,482 votes, with 25,006 votes coming from New York, where Grover Cleveland defeated James G. Blaine by just 1,149 votes, allowing Cleveland to defeat Blaine in a very close contest (219-182 in the electoral college and a margin of 0.57% in the popular vote). Republicans were so angered by St. John&#x27;s party switch, which caused their first presidential election defeat since 1856, that on November 27, 1884, an effigy of St. John was burned in Topeka, Kansas in front of a crowd of three thousand people.
* 1844 presidential election was largely seen as being decided by vote splitting.

==== Other races ====
*An analysis of 2006 to 2012 general election races in the U.S. found 1.5% were spoiled by third-party candidates, according to Philip Bump.
* In 2008, Democrat Al Franken was elected the junior senator from Minnesota, defeating Norm Coleman by only 0.1%. Independent candidate Dean Barkley received over 15% of the vote, and a 2014 analysis by &quot;Time&quot; found that without Barkley in the race, Franken would have lost the election to Coleman.
* As a result of the 2011 Wisconsin protests and subsequent recall elections, the Wisconsin Republican Party has encouraged spoiler candidates to run in the recall elections on the Democrat ticket in order to force the Democrats into a primary election. Republicans argued that this would even the playing field in the recalls, as incumbents facing recall did not have the time to campaign due to their work load in the state senate.
* In Maine&#x27;s 2010 and 2014 gubernatorial elections, Eliot Cutler ran as a left-wing independent. In the 2010 election Paul LePage narrowly defeated him with 218,065 votes to 208,270 votes with the Democratic nominee Libby Mitchell receiving 109,387 votes and possibly spoiling the election for Cutler. However, in 2014 Cutler performed worse and only received 51,518 votes, but it was still greater than the difference between LePage and Mike Michaud causing a possible spoiler effect. These elections and LePage&#x27;s unpopularity led to Maine adopting ranked choice voting.

<doc id="538394" wikidata="Q1893186" url="?curid=538394" title="Eviction">
<text>Eviction is the removal of a tenant from rental property by the landlord. In some jurisdictions it may also involve the removal of persons from premises that were foreclosed by a mortgagee (often, the prior owners who defaulted on a mortgage).

Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction, eviction may also be known as unlawful detainer, summary possession, summary dispossess, summary process, forcible detainer, [[ejectment]], and [[repossession]], among other terms. Nevertheless, the term &quot;eviction&quot; is the most commonly used in communications between the landlord and tenant. Depending on the jurisdiction involved, before a tenant can be evicted, a landlord must win an eviction lawsuit or prevail in another step in the legal process. It should be borne in mind that &quot;eviction&quot;, as with &quot;ejectment&quot; and certain other related terms, has precise meanings only in certain historical contexts (e.g., under the English common law of past centuries), or with respect to specific jurisdictions. In present-day practice and procedure, there has come to be a wide variation in the content of these terms from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

The legal aspects, procedures, and provisions for eviction, by whatever name, vary even between countries or states with similar legal structures.

== The eviction process ==
Most jurisdictions do not permit the landlord to evict a tenant without first taking legal action to do so (commonly referred to as a &quot;self-help&quot; eviction; such actions include changing locks, removing items from the premises, or terminating utility services). Such evictions are generally illegal at any time during the process (including after a landlord wins an eviction suit); a tenant facing such measures may sue the landlord. However, self-help evictions may be permitted in some jurisdictions when commercial tenants are involved, as opposed to residential tenants.

=== Notice ===
Prior to filing a suit in court for eviction, generally the landlord must provide written notice to the tenant (commonly called a &quot;notice to quit&quot; or &quot;notice to vacate&quot;). The residential and commercial ordinances created jurisdictions preventing landlords from taking any action that may force a tenant out of their premises. These actions include, but are not limited to, force and threats, removing essential services, demolishing the property, or interfering with entrance locks.

=== Lawsuit and trial ===
If the tenant remains in possession of the property after the notice to vacate has expired, the landlord can then serve the tenant with a lawsuit.

Depending on the jurisdiction, the tenant may be required to submit a written response by a specified date, after which time another date is set for the trial. Other jurisdictions may simply require the tenant to appear in court on a specified date. Eviction cases are often expedited since the issue is time-sensitive (the landlord loses rental income while the tenant remains in possession). A jury trial may be requested by either party, however until the late 2000s that was very uncommon.

Many of the defendants in eviction case do not show up for court. In many major cities, including Milwaukee, as many as 70% of defendants are no-shows. In the courts in some urban areas only 10% of defendants showed up.

=== Removal from the property ===
As mentioned above, most jurisdictions do not allow a landlord to evict a tenant without legal action being taken first, even if the landlord is successful in court.

Instead, the landlord would have to obtain a &quot;writ of possession&quot; or &quot;warrant of removal&quot; from the court and present it to the appropriate law enforcement officer. The officer then posts a notice for the tenant on the property that the officer will remove the tenant and any other people on the property, though some jurisdictions will not enforce the writ if, on that day, inclement weather is taking place.

With the removal of the tenant also comes the removal of their personal belongings. If the tenant leaves behind anything of value, there is a custom (but no law in some jurisdictions) for the landlord to hold onto their left-behind belongings for 30 days. After these 30 days the landlord is able to sell the left-behind property, usually in an auction, to satisfy any overdue rent arrears.

==No-fault evictions==
A no-fault eviction occurs when a landlord seeks to regain possession of a rented property under laws that do not require him to allege any fault on the part of the tenant such as failure to pay rent, disturbance to neighbors or other tenants in the building, or violation of lease terms. In many jurisdictions, a tenancy at will, as opposed to a term lease tenancy, may be ended at any time with a minimum of thirty days&#x27; notice to tenant, although some jurisdictions require longer notice periods.

As gentrification and the re-population of urban centers by wealthier residents takes place, no-fault evictions are used as a tool to displace tenants in cities with rent control. In California, for example, the Ellis Act allows eviction of rent-controlled tenants if the landlord intends to no longer rent any portion of an apartment building (i.e., landlords cannot be compelled to rent). The Ellis Act has been applied to rentals in San Francisco, Santa Monica and Los Angeles.

==Just-cause evictions==
Just cause eviction, also known as good cause eviction, describes laws that aim to provide tenants protection from unreasonable evictions, rent hikes, and non-renewal of lease agreements. These laws allow tenants to challenge evictions in court when they are not considered to be legitimate evictions. Generally, landlords oppose just-cause eviction laws due to concerns over profit, housing stock, and court cases.
=== Renoviction ===
Renoviction is a term used when a tenant is evicted to renovate a property. A landlord may perform a renoviction to raise the cost of rent for other prospective tenants. In some jurisdictions, such as Ontario, evicted tenants have the right of first refusal.

== Real estate mobbing ==
Real estate mobbing, also known as property mobbing, is the use of mobbing (group bullying) techniques by real estate speculators to constructively or forcibly evict a resident from their dwelling. The United Nations has recognized real estate mobbing as a worldwide cause of forced eviction. Real estate mobbing is acknowledged as a problem in Europe and particularly in Spain.

==Countries==
=== United States ===

In the United States of America, rules for evictions and the eviction process are determined by state, local county, and city rules.

=== Australia ===

If the tenant is on a fixed term tenancy and their lease is coming to an end, a landlord will be required to give them a valid notice to vacate. The period of this notice varies from state to state. If the tenant will not cooperate with the parameters of an eviction notice, application is made to the Tenancy Tribunal for possession of the property.

A landlord cannot legally evict a tenant without obtaining a Possession Order and a Warrant of Possession. A Warrant of Possession directs the police to evict a tenant from the property. The police then contact the agent to arrange a time to go to the property, see the tenants off the premises, change the locks and formally take possession. The eviction must always be carried out by the police; the landlord cannot evict tenants themselves. Taking the law into own hands and failing to act according to the relevant legislation in jurisdiction will carry penalties for a landlord.

On March 29, 2020, Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed that state and territories governments will be moving to put a moratorium on evictions of persons as a result of financial distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The government said these measures were set to last for at least six months.

==Impacts on those being evicted==

There are sometimes communication problems for when the actual eviction date is decided upon, leaving some evictees thoroughly underprepared with nothing packed when the sheriff comes. This can lead to a Skinner box–like experience as evictees sometimes try &quot;riding&quot; the eviction out. (This is sometimes caused by denial.)

Evictees experience higher rates of: depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and even suicide. The process of eviction can take a long time (potentially months) and this can leave the evictee in a heightened state of stress, which makes them more susceptible to stress illnesses. Even after years have passed, studies show that evictees are less happy, optimistic and energetic than those who haven&#x27;t been evicted.

Being evicted can increase rates of job loss. A person is 15% more likely to be laid off after experiencing eviction. This can lead to a cycle where the eviction makes it difficult to work but not working can lead to eviction. Evictions can remain on a tenant&#x27;s record for up to seven years in the United States, and landlords are allowed to reject tenants due to previous evictions. Evictions are a leading cause of homelessness. 

Evictees often end up moving into poorer quality housing, like overcrowded homes. A study that looked at Milwaukee, Wisconsin found that renters who had been involuntarily moved from a prior residence were 25% more likely to experience long-term housing problems than their peers who had only moved voluntarily.

<doc id="538401" wikidata="Q26207" url="?curid=538401" title="Hugh Dalton">
<text>Edward Hugh John Neale Dalton, Baron Dalton, (16 August 1887 – 13 February 1962) was a British Labour Party economist and politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1945 to 1947. He shaped Labour Party foreign policy in the 1930s, opposing pacifism; promoting rearmament against the German threat; and strongly opposed the appeasement policy of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in 1938. Dalton served in Winston Churchill&#x27;s wartime coalition cabinet; after the Dunkirk evacuation he was Minister of Economic Warfare, and established Special Operations Executive. Later in the war he was President of the Board of Trade. As Chancellor in Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour Government, he pushed his policy of cheap money too hard, and mishandled the sterling crisis of 1947 in which much of the 1946 Anglo-American loan was wasted. His political position was already in jeopardy in 1947 when he was forced to resign for, seemingly inadvertently, revealing a sentence of the budget to a reporter minutes before delivering his budget speech. Dalton later returned to the cabinet in relatively minor positions.

His biographer Ben Pimlott characterised Dalton as peevish, irascible, given to poor judgment and lacking administrative talent. Pimlott also recognised that Dalton was a genuine radical and an inspired politician; a man, to quote his old friend and critic John Freeman, &quot;of feeling, humanity, and unshakeable loyalty to people which matched his talent.&quot;

==Early life==
Hugh Dalton was born in Neath in South Wales. His father, John Neale Dalton, was a Church of England clergyman who became chaplain to Queen Victoria, tutor to the princes Albert Victor and his younger brother George (later King George V), and a canon of Windsor.

Dalton was educated at Summer Fields School and then at Eton College. He then went to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he was active in student politics; his socialist views, then very rare amongst undergraduates, earned him the nickname &quot;Comrade Hugh&quot;. Whilst at Cambridge he was President of the Cambridge University Fabian Society. He did not succeed in becoming President of the Cambridge Union Society, despite three attempts to be elected Secretary. At Cambridge, Dalton was especially close to Rupert Brooke whom he met on his first day as an undergraduate and about whom he wrote in the 1950s that &quot;the radiance of his memory still lights my path&quot;. Dalton&#x27;s decision as an undergraduate to join the Labour Party gave him the reputation of being a &quot;class traitor&quot; and an &quot;Etonian renegade&quot; who had abandoned the traditional &quot;Establishment&quot; values of his Eton-Cambridge education; many Conservatives of similar public school and Oxbridge background always had a special distaste for him. Dalton came from a deeply Anglican Tory family devoted to what later generations would call &quot;one nation Conservatism&quot; who instilled into him the idea that members of the British elite had a duty to the nation to serve the greater good by using their talents. He did not see his conversion to socialism as a betrayal of his background as his critics alleged, but rather a continuation as he claimed that socialism was merely the more efficient system for ensuring the greater good of ordinary people. 

He went on to study at the London School of Economics (LSE) and the Middle Temple. During the First World War he was called up into the Army Service Corps, later transferring to the Royal Artillery. In January 1917, he transferred to the Royal Artillery. He served as a lieutenant on the French and Italian fronts, where he was awarded the Italian decoration, the &quot;Medaglia di Bronzo al Valor Militare&quot;, in recognition of his &quot;contempt for danger&quot; during the retreat from Caporetto; he later wrote a memoir of the war called &quot;With British Guns in Italy&quot;. Dalton&#x27;s military service was the formative event of his youth. Dalton later wrote: &quot;I am of that generation which during the Great War was massacred in droves upon the battlefields. Like many millions of others, I served in the Army and unlike most of the best friends of my youth I survived the war. It was my beliefs that politics, rightly handled, can put an end to war, which more than anything else, drew me into the active life of politics when the war was over.&quot; Unlike many others involved in the Labour Party in the interwar period, Dalton was no pacifist, and instead embraced the idea that collective security and armed deterrence were the best means of avoiding another world war. Following demobilisation, he returned to the LSE and the University of London as a lecturer, where he was awarded a DSc (hence his title &quot;Dr Dalton&quot;) for a thesis on the principles of public finance in 1920.

== Political career ==

Dalton stood unsuccessfully for Parliament four times: at the 1922 Cambridge by-election, in Maidstone at the 1922 general election, in Cardiff East at the 1923 general election, and the 1924 Holland with Boston by-election, before entering Parliament for Peckham at the 1924 general election. 

Dalton was unusual amongst Labour MPs, most of whom felt very strongly that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh towards Germany, and who advocated revising the treaty in favour of Germany. Dalton&#x27;s war experiences in the First World War had made him something of a Germanphobe. In 1926, he visited Poland and discovered that in the disputed regions of Upper Silesia and the Polish Corridor that German and Polish populations were hopelessly geographically mixed with no clear-cut geographical lines between the two quarrelling communities. As such, Dalton concluded that returning Upper Silesia and the Polish Corridor to Germany would not solve the German-Polish dispute as all that would do would be to transfer Poles into Germany just as transferring Upper Silesia and the Polish Corridor had transferred Germans into Poland. Dalton argued that &quot;wholesale transfers of population&quot; were the only way to achieve &quot;perfection&quot; because otherwise there would always be communities of Poles or Germans on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the frontier. At the time, Dalton rejected this course and urged the &quot;obliteration&quot; of frontiers between Germany and Poland as the best way of securing peace in Europe, arguing for some sort of German-Polish federation. He recalled about his visit to Poland: &quot;I came away aware for the first time of this most gifted and romantic nation, so brave, so gay, with so much good looks and personal charm in both sexes...It was this visit that finally determined me to try to rewrite the foreign policy of the Labour Party&quot;. Dalton wrote the prevailing viewpoint in the Labour Party in the 1920s was &quot;...a silly syllogism &#x27;Everything that came out of the Allied victory in the war and the Treaty of Versailles is bad. Poland came out of all that. Therefore Poland is bad&#x27;. But few of these &quot;experts&quot; had ever visited Poland or met typical Poles&quot;. Dalton was very interested in Eastern Europe and maintained close ties with the Polish Socialist Party. In his 1928 book &quot;Towards the Peace of Nations&quot;, Dalton praised the forced population exchanges between Turkey and Greece in 1922–1923 for its &quot;cumulatively good&quot; consequences and recommended a similar policy towards Eastern Europe. 

Dalton was regarded in the 1920s as a protégé of Arthur Henderson and like Henderson, he supported the League of Nations, which he saw as an organisation that would promote free trade, disarmament, and arbitration of international disputes. There was a notable contradiction within the Labour Party in the interwar period between its support for disarmament vs. support for collective security, which implied a willingness to go to war against an aggressor state. Dalton was one of the first Labour leaders to confront the contradiction, which led him to choose collective security over disarmament. Other Labour leaders such as Ramsay MacDonald and Arthur Ponsonby preferred disarmament or to gloss over the contradiction by claiming that support for collective security would automatically lead to disarmament. In &quot;Towards the Peace of Nations&quot;, Dalton argued that if the League of Nations should invoke military sanctions against a state that had committed aggression, then Britain should go to war, which led him to argue the British military should not be abolished or sharply reduced as others in the Labour Party wanted. 

Widely respected for his intellectual achievements in economics, Dalton rose in the Labour Party&#x27;s ranks, with election in 1925 to the shadow cabinet and, with strong union backing, to the Labour Party National Executive Committee (NEC). At the 1929 general election, he succeeded his wife Ruth Dalton, who retired, as Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Bishop Auckland.He gained ministerial and foreign policy experience as Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office in Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s second government, between 1929 and 1931. Starting in 1930, Dalton became a Zionist and strongly supported seeing the Palestine Mandate (modern Israel) ultimately becoming a Jewish state. Most Zionists at the time were socialist, and Dalton in a 1930 speech predicated a future Israeli state would be a &quot;socialist commonwealth&quot;. As undersecretary, he clashed with the Foreign Secretary, Arthur Henderson-who favoured returning the Polish Corridor and Upper Silesia to Germany, writing in 1940 that &quot;there was no reason why we should back German claims against Poland, and that moreover, it could not be in British interests to aggrandise at Poland&#x27;s expense a Germany, which had been and might become again, what Poland could never be, a grim menace to this country&quot;. He lost this position as under-secretary when he, and most Labour leaders, rejected MacDonald&#x27;s National Government. As with most other Labour MPs, he lost his seat in 1931; he was elected again in 1935.

Dalton published &quot;Practical Socialism for Britain&quot;, a bold and highly influential assessment of a future Labour government&#x27;s policy options, in 1935. The book revived updated nuts-and-bolts Fabianism, which had been out of favour, and could be used to attack the more militant Left. His emphasis was on using the state as a national planning agency, an approach that appealed well beyond Labour. Dalton had the reputation of being &quot;a brilliant man, but rash, hot-headed and impulsive, a shinning diamond of mercurial, unstable gifts with a penchant for self-damage&quot;. He was considered to be one of the most intelligent of the Labour MPs who was destined for high office should Labour win a general election, but also someone who had a self-destructive streak owning to his vanity and impulsive tendencies. 

===Foreign policy===
Turning his attention to the looming crisis in Europe, he became the Labour Party&#x27;s spokesman on foreign policy in Parliament. A crucial turning point in his views towards Germany was a meeting with a French diplomat Pierre Comert who told him on the basis of secret intelligence that Germany was rearming rapidly in violation of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and had already established an air force (forbidden by Versailles). Comert ended his interview by telling him that strategic bombing could destroy entire cities within hours and that &quot;the lunatics in charge [of Germany] are capable of this!&quot; In May 1935, he wrote in his diary that Clement Attlee had given a speech in Smethwick in the West Midlands on the topic of the looming tensions between Japan and China, which he predicted could cause another world war. Dalton judged the speech a failure as he wrote: &quot;And he talked about the Sino-Jap dispute!...Infinitely remote from the audience in both time and space&quot;. Dalton had a very Euro-centric conception of British foreign policy and tended to see Japan&#x27;s imperialistic policy towards China as a far lesser concern compared to the potential threat posed by Nazi Germany. 

Pacifism was a strong element in the Labour Party, until the Left moved to support arms for Republican (&quot;Loyalist&quot;) Spain during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. The Labour Party was divided between one faction opposed on principle to all war vs. another that was willing to support war against fascist aggression, and as one of the leaders of the latter faction, Dalton frequently fought against the pacifist faction. Dalton clashed in particular with Stafford Cripps, the leader of the pacifistic extreme left wing of the Labour Party. In a 1936 speech Cripps announced that he not only would oppose any war against Germany, but would actually welcome the German conquest of Britain under the grounds that German capitalists were more exploitive and vicious than British capitalists, and hence Nazi rule would bring about a socialist revolution in Britain more quickly. Dalton charged that Cripps had expressed the &quot;judgement of a flea&quot; in that speech, but opposed having Cripps expelled from Labour under the grounds that it would divide Labour and might led to the government calling a snap election. In September 1936, Dalton visited Paris to see the French Premier Léon Blum. He sharply criticised Blum for not offering more aid to the Spanish Republic, only to be countered by Blum who stated he was afraid of causing a civil war in France if he intervened in Spain. However Dalton was not enthusiastic for the Labour party policy of wanting to intervene, later stating:

I was far from enthusiastic for the slogan &quot;arms for Spain&quot; if this meant, as some of my friends eagerly did, that we were to supply arms which otherwise we should keep for ourselves, for I was much more conscious than most of my friends of the terrible insufficiency of British armaments against the German danger.

His views were different from those of Attlee, later recalling that before the Second World War he believed:

as Germany and Italy were potential enemies of Britain and Franco was their ally, it was in Britain&#x27;s interest that Franco should not win the Spanish Civil War. It was on this proposition rather than any extravagant eulogy of the Spanish Government that I based most of my public references to this most tragic struggle.

Yet Dalton admitted he was wrong in this assessment of British interests, stating that &quot;When the Germans overran France in 1940 and reached the Pyrenees, Franco was neutral, and with remarkable skill maintained his neutrality until the end of the war. Hitler respected this and never forced his way through Spain to attack Gibraltar or crossed the Straits into Morocco.&quot; and &quot;Hitler would not have respected the neutrality of a Spanish Republican Government. If Franco had lost the Civil War, Hitler would have occupied Spain.&quot;

Aided by union votes, Dalton moved the party from semi-pacifism to a policy of armed deterrence and rejection of appeasement. He was a bitter enemy of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Dalton in his speeches to the House of Commons charged that the government during the Sudetenland crisis was deliberately trying to exclude the Soviet Union from any role in the crisis despite the fact that Soviet Union had alliances with both France and Czechoslovakia. In a speech to the House of Commons, he stated: &quot;There are some in this country who apparently think it worthwhile and a good bargain to try to push the Soviet Union out of Europe&quot;. In a letter to Robert Vansittart, Dalton wrote: &quot;It was amazing how some people, otherwise intelligent, had a fixture about Russia and seemed almost to prefer that this country should be defeated in war without Russian aid rather than win with it&quot;. 

During the Sudetenland crisis, Dalton frequently defended the Soviet stance. Dalton was a strong supporter of the League of Nations and its principles of collective security, and believed that should be the basis of an Anglo-Soviet alliance. Dalton was attached to the principle of collective security rather than alliance with the Soviet Union &quot;per se&quot;, and stated that if the Soviet Union should invade Germany, Britain should come to Germany&#x27;s aid, and likewise favoured coming to aid of the Soviet Union should Germany invade. Dalton stated that what he really wanted was &quot;a system of mutual guarantee against aggression in Europe&quot;. As the Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov frequently praised the League of Nations and collective security in his speeches, it was under these grounds, rather than support for communism, that Dalton advocated an Anglo-Soviet alliance. Despite his public support for an Anglo-Soviet alliance, in private Dalton admitted that the Soviet Union was &quot;an enigma&quot;. Joseph Stalin was a very remote, mysterious figure who rarely spoke in public or saw foreigners, making it extremely difficult to determine how much Litvinov was supported by Stalin. Dalton wrote in his diary: &quot;This is the most difficult gap in one&#x27;s knowledge to get filled in...what &quot;would&quot; they do? No one in this country seemed to know&quot;. In the crisis, Dalton was in close contact with Charles Corbin, the French ambassador; Jan Masaryk, the Czechoslovak minister; and Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador. The most controversial of his contacts was with Maisky who regularly leaked information about the crisis to Dalton, which he used to attack the government during question time in the House of Commons. Dalton visited the Soviet embassy in London on a frequent basis to confer with Maisky and pick up information. 

Dalton defended the Soviets against the charge of acting in bad faith by only promising to go to war if France did so first, arguing that Moscow was acting in accord with the text of the 1935 Soviet-Czechoslovak alliance, that the Soviet Union was only obligated to go to war if aggression against Czechoslovakia activated the 1924 Franco-Czechoslovak alliance. Dalton believed it was possible for Britain to pressure Poland and Romania into granting the Red Army transit rights to aid Czechoslovakia, which did not have a direct border with the Soviet Union. At a meeting with Chamberlain on 17 September 1938, Dalton criticised the latter for accepting at face value the claims of the French foreign minister Georges Bonnet that the Soviet Union would do nothing if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, and therefore it was foolish to trust the promises from the Soviet foreign commissar Maxim Litvinov who claimed otherwise. Bonnet had told Chamberlain that Litvinov had told Jean Payart, the French &quot;charge d&#x27;affairs&quot; in Moscow, that his government&#x27;s talk of defending Czechoslovakia was empty bluster. Dalton recalled: &quot;The PM said that Bonnet, in consequence of this conversation, entertained grave doubts about whether the SU meant to do anything. At that point, I said &#x27;I must say Mr. Prime Minister that I do not believe this story. It is quite contrary to what I have heard from more than one good source on which I place reliance...This conversation, moreover, is quite inconsistent, with the clear, repeated, and recent statements by the Soviet if France moved, she would move at once&#x27;&quot;. Dalton was well aware that the &quot;Yezhovschina&quot; had wrecked the Red Army at least for the moment, but still felt that the Soviet Union was the only power capable of engaging with Germany in Eastern Europe, and was worth having as an ally against the &quot;Reich&quot;. In a speech in the House of Commons, Dalton asked Chamberlain &quot;would it not be worth something to have the Red Army and Red Airforce on our side instead of being neutral? The Prime Minister claims for himself the title of a realist, but does not any realistic foreign policy in this country necessarily include an attempt to make sure that, if the worse should come, we should have that enormous potential on our side instead of being immobilised?...Is it not a clear calculation that if it can be shown in advance that there would be a combined force arrayed against an aggressor, which would include the Soviet Union, we should be more much likely to avoid war?&quot; Like most other British anti-appeasers, Dalton did not want a war with the &quot;Reich&quot;, and instead believed an alliance of the Soviet Union, France, and Britain would be sufficient to cause Germany to back down from its demands on Czechoslovakia. On 30 September 1938, the crisis was ended by a conference in Munich that agreed that the Sudetenland would be ceded to Germany over the course of October 1938. During the debates on the Munich Agreement in the House of Commons, Dalton criticised the agreement as giving too much to Adolf Hitler in exchange for a written promise that he would not start a war with Britain. The British historian Louise Shaw noted that Dalton like the other anti-appeasers advocated a foreign policy that made sense in deterrence terms, but did not address the practical questions if the crisis turned to war. Dalton assumed if the crisis came to war, the Dominions would all join Britain. In fact only New Zealand had committed itself to do so while South Africa, Australia and Canada all indicated a distinct unwillingness to go to war for Czechoslovakia. Likewise, Dalton assumed if war came, Poland and Romania would give transit rights for the Red Army to defend Czechoslovakia, which was not the case. 

On 15 March 1939, Germany occupied the Czech half of Czecho-Slovakia. Later that same day, Hitler during his visit to Prague proclaimed the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia. On 16 March 1939, Dalton played a leading role in the debates in the House of Commons about the end of Czechoslovak independence. Under the Munich Agreement, Britain had promised a &quot;guarantee&quot; of Czecho-Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia had been renamed in October 1938) against aggression in exchange for the Sudetenland being allowed to &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;. Dalton in his speech to the House of Commons noted bitterly that Germany had just violated the Munich Agreement and that the British &quot;guarantee&quot; had proven worthless. Dalton stated that Chamberlain &quot;should disappear from office&quot;, saying that the only decent thing left for him to do would be to resign immediately. Dalton called the newly declared state of Slovakia a sham as he stated the Slovak declaration of independence &quot;had been paid for by German money...and organised by German agents&quot;.. Dalton called the Slovak declaration of independence &quot;a convenient legal let-ago of the guarantee&quot; as Chamberlain insisted that the &quot;guarantee&quot; was not longer valid as Czecho-Slovakia had ceased to exist on 14 March even before the Germans marched in on 15 March. In response to several Conservative MPs who called Czechoslovakia an &quot;artificial&quot; state created by the Treaty of Versailles, Dalton called Czechoslovakia &quot;a once free and happy model democracy in Central Europe&quot; and noted pointedly that he had actually visited Czechoslovakia a number of times, unlike his critics who had never been there. Dalton ended his speech by warning of &quot;a rapidly increasing danger to Britain&quot;, supported the idea put forward by the former Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden for a bloc of states to resist further aggression and urged a barrier to further aggression under the slogan &quot;thus far, but no further&quot;. 

On the evening of 30 March 1939, Dalton along with Arthur Greenwood visited 10 Downing Street where they were informed by Chamberlain that he planned to announce the British &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland in a speech in the House of Commons the next day. Dalton expressed his approval of the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland, but told Chamberlain that he &quot;would never get away with it...unless he brought in the Russians&quot;. During the Danzig crisis, Dalton supported Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of creating a &quot;peace front&quot; to deter Germany from invading Poland, but was opposed to Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of making Poland the eastern pivot of the proposed &quot;peace front&quot; rather than the Soviet Union. Dalton argued that Poland was too weak to play the role of the eastern pivot, and only the Soviet Union had the sufficient industrial and military capacity to engage in war with Germany. In particular, Dalton charged that Chamberlain was inept in offering the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland without any conditions as he noted that Britain had no leverage over the Polish foreign minister, Colonel Józef Beck, into granting transit rights to the Red Army in the event of a German invasion of Poland. The issue of transit rights became of a cardinal importance during the Danzig crisis as the Soviets refused to sign an alliance with Britain and France unless Poland gave transit rights first, which Colonel Beck was utterly opposed to granting. In April 1939, Dalton strongly criticised the Chamberlain government&#x27;s unwillingness to seriously negotiate, noting that the British government took days and sometimes weeks to respond to Soviet offers of an alliance, which he denounced as negotiating in bad faith. As during the Sudetenland crisis, Dalton did not want a war with Germany, but instead expected the &quot;peace front&quot; of the Soviet Union, France, and Britain would be sufficient to deter Germany from invading Poland.

In June 1939, Dalton along with Churchill and Lloyd George were the only MPs to support the Soviet claim to offer a &quot;guarantee&quot; to Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania along with the Soviet concept of &quot;indirect aggression&quot;. But Dalton was not a partisan of the Soviet line, and in July 1939 told Maisky that his government was partly to blame for the slow pace of the talks and the failure to reach a joint Anglo-Soviet &quot;guarantee&quot; of Romania. At another meeting with Maisky in July he supported Chamberlain&#x27;s demand that the Soviet Union issue a &quot;guarantee&quot; of Belgium and the Netherlands to complement the &quot;guarantee&quot; that Chamberlain had issued in February. Dalton told Maisky that the Soviet claim his government had no interest in the Low Countries was &quot;sheer tripe&quot; under the grounds &quot;there will be a war in which the SU is engaged in or not&quot;. As the talks moved at a sluggish pace, and word of the abrasive negotiating style of the new Soviet foreign commissar Vyacheslav Molotov, Dalton was forced to concede in the summer that the Soviets were in part to blame. Dalton wrote in his diary that he was faced with dilemma: &quot;Either we press the government or not. In the first case we may encourage the Russians to be more difficult and be represented by ministers here as impeding negotiations...In other cases, we are taken to acquiescing in HMG&#x27;s conduct of negotiations and make our supporters in the country impatient&quot;. Dalton approved of Chamberlain&#x27;s handling of the Tientsin incident, saying in August 1939 that there was no need for a statement on the crisis in Tientsin (modern Tianjin) as &quot;I am watching &quot;Europe&quot; day by day&quot; as he felt that the crisis in Danzig (modern Gdańsk) to be far more important. In August 1939, Dalton along with Clement Attlee visited Paris to meet the French Socialist leaders, and expressed much dismay that the French Socialists were &quot;either pacificist or defeatist&quot;. 

Hugh Dalton was among the 2,300 names of prominent persons listed on the Nazis&#x27; Special Search List, of those who were to be arrested on the invasion of Great Britain and turned over to the Gestapo.

==Second World War==
===The Phoney War===
On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland, which led to expectations that Chamberlain would honour the &quot;guarantee&quot; he had issued on 31 March. Instead, he gave a statement that it was necessary to confer with the French premier Édouard Daladier about what to do. Dalton saw the Polish ambassador, Count Edward Raczyński, to ask if he could assist Poland by asking questions in the House of Commons about when Britain would declare war. Raczyński assured Dalton that he had every confidence that Chamberlain would honour the commitments he had made, and no such questions would be necessary. Late on 2 September 1939, Dalton went to the Foreign Office and was told by Sir William Malkin, the Foreign Office&#x27;s legal adviser, on the staircase that &quot;I have the declaration in the bag. It is settled now!&quot; Continuing on his way, Dalton met the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Sir Alexander Cadogan, the Permanent Undersecretary. Lord Halifax told Dalton that Britain would be issuing an ultimatum to Germany that would expire at 11 am 3 September, and failing its acceptance the United Kingdom would be at war. Dalton in response told Halifax &quot;Thank God!&quot; at the news. Halifax further stated that he expected France to issue a similar ultimatum the next day as well, saying &quot;it will be all right tomorrow&quot;. As expected, the ultimatum calling upon the &quot;Reich&quot; to cease its war against Poland and withdraw all of its forces was rejected, and shortly after 11 am Neville Chamberlain announced on the radio that Britain was now at war. Shortly after the declaration of war, Dalton along with A. V. Alexander met with Charles Corbin, the French ambassador to the Court of St. James. Corbin was upset at rumours being spread that France intended not to honour the alliance with Poland signed in 1921. Dalton confronted Corbin by pointing to his watch and saying: &quot;My country is at war &quot;now&quot; in fulfilment of &quot;our&quot; pledge to Poland&quot;. Corbin responded: &quot;And &quot;my&quot; country will be at war in a few hours time&quot;. Corbin further pointed out that France had already mobilised, calling up 3 million Frenchmen to their national service and &quot;soon she will have six million&quot; mobilised, which was vastly more manpower being committed than what Britain had committed. Corbin also pointed that land warfare tended to be the most costly; that France had a common border with Germany and &quot;it is upon my country that the heaviest blow will fall&quot;. 

Labour issued a statement calling upon support for the war, but announced the it retained the right to criticise the government and would never join a coalition government headed by Chamberlain. At a meeting of the shadow cabinet, Dalton very firmly announced that no Labour MPs or peers were to join the Chamberlain cabinet, saying &quot;it is not as though our leaders were supermen capable of exercising vast influence through in a tiny minority&quot;. Both Arthur Greenwood and A.V. Alexander were severely tempted to join the Chamberlain cabinet, but were dissuaded upon the threat of expulsion from the Labour Party. However, he left open the possibility that Labour might join a coalition government headed by another Conservative, which was intended to weaken Chamberlain&#x27;s grip on the Conservative Party. 
Dalton had long considered himself a Polonophile and was close to Count Edward Raczyński, the Polish ambassador to the Court of St. James. After war was declared, Dalton threw himself into support for Poland and in a speech on 11 September 1939 denounced the Chamberlain government for not providing any military support for Poland, saying &quot;to sacrifice an Eastern Front altogether is a tremendous price to pay for whatever advantages are supposed to result from air inactivity in the West&quot;. The same day, Dalton went to see Sir Kingsley Wood, the Air Secretary, to demand that he be flown into Poland to assist the Polish war effort. Wood rejected that request on the grounds that &quot;the scheme was not considered advisable&quot;. Dalton continued to lobby government ministers to open a strategic bombing offensive against Germany until 27 September 1939 when Warsaw surrendered after being besieged. At a party hosted by Count Raczyński at the Polish embassy on 18 November 1939, Dalton first met Colonel Colin Gubbins who had served with the British military mission in Poland and had escaped via Romania. Gubbins made such a positive impression on Dalton that the next year he was to insist that Gubbins served as the military head of the Special Operations Executive. The war took on a personal note for Dalton on 23 December 1939 when he learned that one of his prewar friends, the Polish Socialist Mieczysław Niedziałkowski, had been arrested by the Gestapo. 

During the Phoney War, Dalton cultivated contacts with anti-Chamberlain Conservative MPs such as Leo Amery, Robert Boothby, and Anthony Eden, suggesting that they vote with Labour against the government should an opportune moment present itself. In a book published in March 1940 entitled &quot;Hitler&#x27;s War: Before and After&quot;, Dalton argued that forced population exchanges were the solution to the problems of Eastern Europe as he argued that both the Sudetenland crisis and the Danzig crisis had proved that the existence of German minorities in Eastern Europe was being used as a pretext for German aggression. Dalton argued that to prevent a repeat of the German complaints about the Polish Corridor that East Prussia should be annexed to Poland after the war. He approved of the point in the &quot;final offer&quot; that the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop presented to the British ambassador Nevile Henderson late on the night of 30 August 1939 for a forced population exchange between Germany and Poland, and stated that after an Allied victory an &quot;organised movement of population&quot; be carried out under the auspices of &quot;an impartial arbiter&quot;. He also called for expelling the entire German community of the Sudetenland as the &quot;indisputable condition of future tranquility&quot;. 

Chamberlain&#x27;s position became untenable after many Conservative MPs refused to support him in the Norway Debate in April 1940, and Dalton and other senior Labour leaders made clear they would join any coalition government &quot;except&quot; one headed by Chamberlain. Just before the Norway Debate about allegations that the government had mismanaged the expedition to Norway, Dalton told the anti-Chamberlain Conservative MP Harold Macmillan that the Labour would treat the Norway debate as a confidence vote, and urged Macmillan to have his allies vote against the government. After Chamberlain resigned early in May, and Lord Halifax had declined the position, Winston Churchill became prime minister. Attlee declared his support for Churchill and announced that Labour would be joining his government. At the time, there was a Labour Party conference in Bournemouth in session, and many delegates were displeased with the prospect of Labour serving in a Churchill government as Churchill was well known for his anti-union and anti-socialist views. In a speech on the evening of 10 May, Dalton blasted the anti-Churchill delegates as &quot;a lot of freaks talking pathetic rubbish&quot;.

===Minister of Economic Warfare===
During Churchill&#x27;s coalition government (1940–45) Dalton was Minister of Economic Warfare from 1940 to 1942. On 14 May 1940, Churchill phoned Dalton who was attending the conference in Bournemouth to tell him: &quot;Your friends tell me that you made a considerable study of economic warfare. Will you take that ministry?&quot; Dalton answered: &quot;I should be very glad to do so. I am proud to serve under you&quot;. He established the Special Operations Executive, and was later a member of the executive committee of the Political Warfare Executive. Dalton&#x27;s friend Niedzialkowski was shot without a trial as an &quot;enemy of the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; on 21 June 1940 in the Palmiru Wood, an action which greatly angered Dalton when he learned of it. The British historian Matthew Frank called Dalton &quot;a particularly duplicitous, cunning and vain politician with an overbearing and forceful personality&quot; who exercised more influence on government policy than what his titles would suggest. Dalton was widely respected, but also disliked in the cabinet. His fellow Labour MP Emmanuel Shinwell called him &quot;the most wicked man in politics I&#x27;ve known&quot;. The Conservative MP Brendan Bracken said Dalton was &quot;the biggest bloodiest shit I&#x27;ve met!&quot; Dalton greatly admired Churchill who by contrast could not stand him, once joking &quot;Dr. Dalton as he calls himself, though I have yet to hear of a patient he has cured&quot;. Churchill once remarked &quot;Keep that man away from me. I can&#x27;t stand his booming voice and shifty eyes&quot;. The British historian Terry Charman wrote Dalton was greatly respected for his intelligence and dynamism, but that he had &quot;a very abrasive and bullying personality&quot; that alienated many. A typical comment from Dalton was his statement to Churchill in late May 1940 that the sessions of the House of Commons were a waste of time, leading him to ask &quot;why don&#x27;t you shut up this bloody monkey house or at any rate open it one day a week?&quot; Dalton frequently mocked Shinwell as &quot;Shinbad the Tailor&quot; as Shinwell played more the role of an opposition politician during question periods in the House of Commons, asking difficult questions for the ministers.

As Minister of Economic Warfare, Dalton argued that guerrilla warfare was the natural ally of Britain&#x27;s strategic bombing offensive, sabotaging German war industries that lay beyond the range of bombers. At a meeting on 1 July 1940, Dalton put forward to the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and the service ministers his case for the Ministry of Economic Warfare having its own armed wing. Dalton argued: &quot;What we have in mind is not a military job at all. It concerns trade unionists, socialists, etc-the making of revolution and chaos-no more suitable for soldiers than fouling at football&quot;. Both Stewart Menzies, the chief of MI6, and Frederick Beaumont-Nesbitt, the Director of Military Intelligence, were opposed to Dalton&#x27;s plan, but Clement Attlee was persuaded that Dalton&#x27;s plan had much merit, and set about lobbying Churchill to support it. It was around this time that Dalton came to be known as &quot;Dr. Dynamo&quot;, the nickname given to him by Gladwyn Jebb that was a reference to his DSc in economics and to his relentless dynamism as he pressed his case. Attlee insisted to Churchill that only someone on the left was capable of leading an organisation dedicated to subversion and sabotage, and that &quot;Dr. Dynamo&quot; was the best man available. Beyond the immediate concerns, the Labour leaders had a deep distrust of MI6. The 1924 election had been decided by the so-called Zinoviev letter, a forged letter supposedly written by Grigory Zinoviev of the Comintern instructing British Communists to infiltrate the Labour Party and the British military that was published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on the eve of the election. The Zinoviev letter had been leaked to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; by someone in MI6, and as a result Attlee and the other Labour leaders simply did not trust MI6, and wanted an intelligence organisation headed by one of their own. At a meeting on 22 July 1940, Churchill gave his approval for the Special Operations Executive (SOE), telling Dalton &quot;And now set Europe ablaze!&quot; Dalton appointed Jebb as his &quot;chief executive officer&quot;, which proved to be a fortuitous appointment as Jebb was a close friend of Sir Alexander Cadogan, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office who proved to an invaluable ally for SOE at Whitehall. Unlike Halifax and his successor as Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, who saw SOE as a rather distasteful organisation which they wanted the Foreign Office to keep at arm&#x27;s length, Cadogan was always a strong supporter of SOE. Halifax was opposed to Dalton&#x27;s plans to have SOE agents attached to the British legation in Bucharest in order to blow up the Romanian oil fields that supplied the &quot;Reich&quot; with much of its oil. In a letter to Halifax, Dalton stated: &quot;We have got to organise movements in enemy-occupied territory comparable to the Sein Fein movement in Ireland, to the Chinese guerrillas now operating against Japan, to the Spanish irregulars who played such a notable role in Wellington&#x27;s campaign...the &quot;democratic international&quot; must use many different methods including industrial and military sabotage, labour agitation and strikes, continuous propaganda, terrorist acts against traitors and German leaders, boycotts and riots&quot;. The American historian Douglas Porch described Dalton as a &quot;true radical&quot; who thought that most British Army officers were too conservative to embrace guerrilla warfare, and encouraged the recruitment of unconventional people. The headquarters of SOE were on Baker Street, hence the nickname for SOE as the &quot;Baker Street Irregulars&quot; after the gang of street urchins who assisted Sherlock Holmes in the stories by Arthur Conan Doyle. 

SOE is most famous for its operations in France, but in 1940 Dalton was highly dismissive of any possibility of resistance in France, writing &quot;the French are too much attached to their mistresses and their soup and their little properties. We see right before our eyes nothing less than the liquification of France&quot;. Dalton disliked General Charles de Gaulle whom he hoped would be replaced by someone else as the leader of the Free French, writing in his diary: &quot;Still no Frenchmen blowing any trumpets anywhere except de G in London and his trumpet blasts are becoming a bit monotonous&quot;. He saw de Gaulle as a power-hungry adventurer of questionable democratic convictions, and had no faith in him as an ally. Dalton&#x27;s view of French Army officers in general was precisely the same as those of the French Socialists, namely as a gang of reactionary Catholics hostile to the heritage of the French Revolution. SOE had given the responsibility for covert propaganda while the Ministry of Information under Alfred Duff Cooper was in charge of overt propaganda. By November 1940, Dalton and Duff Cooper were feuding over control of propaganda, leading to Churchill to appoint Lord Beaverbrook to serve as a meditator. 

Dalton had a special interest in Poland as it was the only country in 1940 where guerrilla warfare was actually being waged, primarily by Polish Army soldiers who had retreated to the forests in 1939. Besides Gubbins, Dalton&#x27;s main liaison was Stanisław Kot, the Minister of the Interior in the Polish government-in-exile. On 18 June 1940, General Władysław Sikorski ordered the Union of Armed Struggle resistance group to cease their guerrilla attacks as &quot;pointless&quot; as too many Poles were being executed by the Germans in retaliation and to limit their activities for the time being to intelligence-gathering. Despite Sikorski&#x27;s orders, Dalton still saw the Polish resistance as SOE&#x27;s &quot;principal asset&quot; in 1940 and was very keen to have the guerrilla war in Poland renewed. Dalton had pressed since the summer of 1940 for the Royal Air Force to make aircraft available to parachute in SOE agents to make contact with the Polish resistance, a request that was finally approved by the Air Ministry in late 1940. In the fall of 1940, Dalton met with Kot a number of times to plan SOE&#x27;s operations in Poland. Dalton had insisted upon making Gubbins the military head of SOE and he reported to duty on 18 November 1940. Jebb described Gubbins as &quot;the real motive force in the machine&quot;. Gubbins later stated that Dalton was a difficult minister to serve, but that he was completely dedicated to making SOE a success and was relentless in defending SOE from its many critics in Whitehall. Unlike other &quot;Establishment&quot; figures, Gubbins did not see Dalton as a &quot;class traitor&quot; for being a socialist, and moreover shared Dalton&#x27;s admiration for the Poles. Gubbins said of Dalton that &quot;He drove himself and his leading figures in SOE equally hard&quot;. 

Dalton spent Christmas 1940 in Scotland as the guest of General Sikorski where he reviewed the Polish divisions that been had stationed there. Dalton described Polish soldiers he reviewed as &quot;fine soldiers and attractive human beings&quot;. Besides making speeches, Dalton&#x27;s visit to Scotland was to make contact with the Sixth Bureau (Polish military intelligence) in order to find volunteers for the SOE. Dalton was able to use the role of the Polish Air Force squadron to finally have Churchill overrule the Air Ministry&#x27;s opposition to the long and dangerous flight to Poland, and make an aircraft available for SOE&#x27;s Polish operations. The containers that were to be parachuted into Poland along with the agents carrying arms, false papers and the other paraphernalia of a secret agent were to become standard issue for SOE agents throughout Europe. Just before the flight was launched, Józef Retinger held a party whose guests of honour were Dalton and Sikorski to celebrate the mission. The first flight taking three Polish SOE agents, namely Stanisław Krzymowski, Józef Zabielski and Czesław Raczkowski, to Poland took place on 15 February 1941. The round flight of 1,500 miles was to Poland in a Whitley bomber nearly exhausted the fuel reserves of the plane and the three Polish agents were parachuted by mistake into the Warthegau ruled by the violently anti-Polish &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Arthur Greiser. The Germans found out about the parachute landings as they captured the containers and posted wanted posters all over Poland labelling the three SOE agents as &quot;exceptionally dangerous bandits&quot; for whose capture a generous reward of &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; were offered. The Polish operation marked the first time that SOE had attracted attention in Europe. Dalton was overjoyed when the news reached him that despite all the wanted posters the three Polish agents had reached Warsaw and made contact with the Resistance, which he saw as the beginning of a great revolt in Poland. Dalton did not seem to understand that Poland was at the extreme range of British aircraft and that his plans to fly in a massive number of weapons and agents, as the prelude for sending in an entire airborne division with the aim of launching a revolt, were unrealistic. An attempt to send SOE agents into the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia was less successful. Dalton and Gubbins met with Edvard Beneš, the president of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, and his intelligence chief František Moravec, and secured the promise that a dozen Czech servicemen would volunteer for SOE. Just before the flight to send the Czech SOE agents into the Protectorate was set to take off, the mission was &quot;gazumped&quot; by MI6 who claimed the agent who was to serve as the radio operator for themselves, thereby causing the mission to be aborted. 

Churchill accepted Dalton, whom he disliked, as a minister because Attlee had insisted that he have a portfolio. Over the course of the winter of 1940–1941, Dalton made countless complaints that Churchill was not seeing him. Churchill&#x27;s intelligence adviser, Desmond Morton, came from MI6 and like other MI6 officers he was hostile towards the upstart SOE. On 17 February 1941, Frank Nelson of SOE recorded a phone call from Morton whose general gist was that &quot;the Prime Minister hated Dalton, hated Jebb, hated me, hated the entire organisation&quot;. It was not until March 1941 that Dalton was finally invited to spend the weekend with Churchill at the Chequers estate. On 27 March 1941, a bloodless coup d&#x27;etat overthrew the Regent of Yugoslavia, Prince Paul, and proclaimed the boy king King Peter II to be of his majority. The two principal leaders of the coup in Belgrade were General Borivoje Mirković and General Dušan Simović, but in London Dalton claimed the credit, arguing that the SOE had organised the coup, a claim whose veracity was unclear. The claim that the SOE had launched coup in Belgrade did much to improve Dalton&#x27;s standing with Churchill. The sequel to the coup was the German Invasion of Yugoslavia launched on 6 April 1941. Simović who was now serving as prime minister unwisely chose not to mobilise the Yugoslav military, vainly hoping not to provoke Hitler, and equally unwisely spread the Yugoslav forces too thin trying to defend all of Yugoslavia. Within twelve days, Yugoslavia was conquered and the Yugoslav government fled to London to join the other governments-in-exile already located there. Dalton later claimed that the coup in Belgrade was a crucial turning point in the war as he maintained the invasion of Yugoslavia in April delayed the launch of Operation Barbarossa from May to June. Dalton wrote &quot;the effect of the coup, disappointing in military terms in Yugoslavia itself, delayed the German attack by a precious fortnight.&quot; 

In May 1941, Dalton came into a dispute with Archibald Wavell, the GOCinC of Middle East Command, over the control of the SOE&#x27;s station in Cairo, which was responsible for SOE operations in the Middle East and the Balkans. On 10 May 1941, Eric Dorman-Smith, writing on behalf of Wavell, ordered that SOE Cairo was subject to the &quot;order and instruction&quot; of Middle East Command. Dalton wrote to Wavell protesting against placing a SOE station &quot;under the direct orders of your staff&quot;, saying that as Minister of Economic Warfare, all SOE stations were under his control. By the summer of 1941, food requisitions by the occupying powers had caused a famine in Greece. As Minister of Economic Warfare, Dalton was in charge of enforcing the blockade against Greece, which the Germans blamed for the famine. Throughout the entire famine in Greece, the German position was that the &quot;Reich&quot; would not nothing to help the staving Greeks, and if the British wanted to help the Greeks, they should lift the blockade against Greece. In June 1941, Eden suggested lifting the blockade, saying that much of the Greek population was going to starve to death, which was opposed by Dalton who argued this would render the blockade of Europe ineffective. On 3 July 1941, Dalton reversed himself and told Eden that he was prepared to ignore food shipments to Greece via Turkey, saying he wanted &quot;a tacit understanding with the Greeks that we wink at shipments of food and not attack ships engaged in this traffic&quot;. 

In August 1941, reports reached London that some of the Serb units in the Royal Yugoslav Army had fled into the mountains in April and were waging a guerrilla war. The guerrillas called themselves the Chetniks after the guerrilla fighters of the 19th century and were led by Draža Mihailović. On 28 August 1941, Simović met with Churchill to tell him of the existence of the Chetniks and on the same day Churchill ordered Dalton to offer whatever support SOE could to the Chetniks. On 29 August 1941, Dalton declared that his policy towards the Chetniks was to have SOE offer maximum support in form of arms and ammunition, and that &quot;the guerrilla and sabotage bands now active in Yugoslavia should show sufficient resistance to cause constant embarrassment to the occupying forces&quot;. However, Dalton vetoed having the Chetniks &quot;attempt any large-scale uprisings or ambitious military operations which only result at present in severe repression&quot;. Dalton told Churchill he was in the process of dispatching a SOE mission to the Chetniks that would consist of two Yugoslav officers, Zahariji Osojiċ and Mirko Lalatović, and a British officer, Bill Hudson. At this stage in the war, SOE worked exclusively with the Chetniks as no-one in the British government were aware in the summer of 1941 of the existence of rival Communist Partisan resistance movement led by Josip Broz Tito. The SOE mission was landed via submarine on the coast of Montenegro close to Petrovac. It was not until September that the SOE discovered that there were two resistance movements in Yugoslavia: the left-wing Partisans and the right-wing Chetniks.

On 8 October 1941, de Gaulle wrote to Dalton requesting permission to have the Gaullist resistance groups undertake &quot;political&quot; work instead of the purely military work that they had been performing to date. Dalton vetoed this request under the grounds that the purpose of SOE was to encourage resistance in France, not take sides in French politics by backing the Gaullists, against the other non-Gaullist groups. De Gaulle&#x27;s response was to simply ignore Dalton&#x27;s veto and to send out Jean Moulin in January 1942 with orders to persuade all of the non-Gaullist resistance groups to accept his claim to be the leader of Free France. By November 1941, a major dilemma for SOE had emerged when it was learned that a war-within-the-war had broken out as the Partisans and Chetniks were fighting each other. This was especially problematic for Dalton who had presented Yugoslavia as a success story for SOE as he argued that the bands of guerillas up in the mountains of Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro had tied down a number of German divisions that otherwise be used in North Africa or against the Soviet Union. In a letter to Churchill on 11 December 1941, Dalton claimed that SOE had brokered a truce between Mihailović and Tito, the morale of the guerrillas and the combined force of the Chetniks and the Partisans were &quot;immobilising no less than 7 German and 12 Italian divisions&quot;. Dalton wrote it was &quot;absolute essential to keep the revolt going if we possibly can and to regard it as an extension of the Libyan front&quot;.

===President of the Board of Trade===
Dalton became President of the Board of Trade in 1942; the future Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell, drafted into the civil service during the war, was his Principal Private Secretary. In this position he tackled the price rings. On 21 February 1942, Churchill phoned Dalton to offer to promote him to President of the Board of Trade. He wrote in his diary that day: &quot;Handing over SOE twangs my heart strings, and I shall feel very desolate and unfriended if I lose the daily presence of whose who have been for 21 months my trusted inner circle&quot;. Even after leaving SOE, Dalton remained in close contact with the Polish government-in-exile, especially with Józef Retinger. In March 1942, Dalton introduced a bill in the House of Commons for coal rationing, which led to strong opposition from the Conservative MPs who saw his bill as the first step towards the nationalisation of the coal industry. At least 50 Tory MPs threatened to resign from the party and go over to the opposition side if Dalton&#x27;s bill was passed, which would had eroded the government&#x27;s majority. In the cabinet, Dalton&#x27;s bill was supported by Ernest Bevin and Stafford Cripps, but opposed by Churchill, which led Dalton to drop the bill in May 1942. Instead, Dalton in a white paper released in early June 1942 proposed &quot;dual control&quot; of the coal mining industry with the British state taking control of the mines while the mining companies would retain control over the financial aspects of the mines, a compromise that was badly received in the Labour party. The controversy reflected a more broader test of strength over social policy with one Conservative MP telling Dalton that &quot;they acted as they did because they felt the Labour Party in the Government was getting too of its own way&quot;. 

Dalton was very close to Edvard Beneš and supported his plans to expel the entire Sudeten German community after the war, saying that the Sudetenland crisis of 1938 had proven that Sudeten Germans were not loyal to Czechoslovakia. In May 1942, Dalton told General Władysław Sikorski that he supported Poland after the war annexing the &quot;whole East Prussian coast and Danzig&quot; and that the Poles should &quot;drive out&quot; all of the Germans living there. Dalton often argued that forced population transfer between Greece and Turkey in 1922–1923 should be the model for solving the problems of minorities in Eastern Europe as he argued for populations transfers as the best way of preventing future wars. During the Quit India Movement protests in August 1942, Dalton blamed &quot;Indian capitalists&quot; for the protests, charging that Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress Party in general were puppets of pro-Axis Indian businessmen. Dalton wanted the Raj to bankroll the Radical Democratic Party led by M. N. Roy to create a counterbalance to the Congress Party and the Muslim League. In August 1942, Dalton endorsed a paper from one of his civil servants, James Meade, calling for an &quot;International Commercial Union&quot;, which served as the prototype for what eventually became GATT. In November 1942, Dalton circulated Meade&#x27;s paper to the rest of the cabinet, having &quot;taken account, but not too much account of all the frightened and too prudent shrieks of my officials&quot;. In December 1942, Dalton formed a committee under a civil servant, Arnold Overton, that called for &quot;a large scale clearance of pre-war impediments to trade between nations&quot; by cutting tariffs by 25% for all members of the &quot;Commercial Union&quot; along with a ban on new tariffs. Dalton&#x27;s proposal for an end to the protectionism that characterised the 1930s drew strong opposition within the cabinet from Leo Amery, the India Secretary and a long-standing advocate of Imperial Preference. Churchill tended to support the call for free trade, but was unwilling to go too far least he trigger a revolt by Amery along with a number of Conservative backbenches. However, at a cabinet meeting, Churchill endorsed Dalton&#x27;s proposal by saying he was for &quot;the freest possible exchange of goods and services&quot;, though he did not say if that meant the abolition of the Imperial preference tariffs and he called for Britain to have the right to impose new tariffs to maintain the balance-of-payments. The cabinet voted to accept Dalton&#x27;s proposal for a multilateral trade agreement as the basis of the post-war world by a vote of 15 to 2. Before embarking on negotiations, it was necessary to secure the agreement of the Dominions. Of all the Dominions, Canada was by far the most enthusiastic as the United States was Canada&#x27;s largest trading partner and the United Kingdom the second-largest, and from the Canadian perspective ending the Anglo-American trade war that had started with the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act was imperative. By contrast, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa all expressed reservations about the end of Imperial Preference as all three had large agricultural sectors that benefited from access to the British market. The need for a common position between Britain and the Dominions delayed the talks with the Americans on reducing tariffs after the war, much to Dalton&#x27;s vexation. 

In a speech in March 1943, Churchill stated that after the war he wanted to lead &quot;a national government comprising the best men in all the parties&quot;, an ambiguous statement that suggested that he either wanted to continue the coalition after the war or found a centrist party or was a warning to Labour that the party might split as had in 1931 if it tried to break up the coalition after the war. In response, Attlee issued a statement saying in effect that Labour would decide what course to pursue when the war was won. Within the Labour Party and in the newspapers, it was widely rumoured that Dalton along with Herbert Morrison were angling to have the coalition government continued after the war, and were pressing for Attlee to make a statement committing the party to that course. The rumours were true. Both Dalton and Morrison were both convinced that the &quot;Churchill factor&quot;, namely Churchill&#x27;s popularity, would ensure that the Conservatives would win the next general election, and that continuing the coalition would ensure that there would be Labour ministers in the cabinet and that the government would pass at least some social reforms. 

In May 1943, Dalton told Philip Noel-Baker that &quot;we should not try to make frontiers fit the perverse distribution of racial populations, assumed to be immobile. The repatriation of the Greek minority from Turkey and the more recent, and incredibly more brutal movements ordered by Hitler show what can be done&quot;. Starting on 23 June 1943, Dalton as chairman of Labour&#x27;s international sub-committee was charged with drawing up a Labour government&#x27;s post-war foreign policy in order to rebut the charge that Labour only spoke in abstract terms about foreign policy. Dalton&#x27;s principal concern in his paper was Germany, which he wanted to totally disarmed forever and possibly broken up into several new states. Because German aggression in Eastern Europe had been justified om the grounds that Germann was protecting the &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; (ethnic German) minorities, Dalton advocated expelling all of the &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; into Germany. Dalton wrote that the Treaty of Versailles was flawed because it left all of their peoples of Eastern Europe in their places and imposed a series of minority treaties on the states of Eastern Europe designed to protect the rights of minorities, which had provided an excuse for German aggression. Dalton wrote: &quot;This time, the frontiers have been drawn, having regard to geographical and economic convenience, all national minorities should be encouraged to join the national states to which they belong. In particular, all Germans left outside the post-war frontiers of Germany should be encouraged to &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot;. It will indeed be in their interests to do so, and in good time, because their victims will be on their tracks. Such movements of population will be a small affair compared with the gigantic &quot;general post&quot; which Hitler has set going all over Europe, and the vast post-war problem of the repatriation of prisoners and exiles. The transfer of the population between Turkey and Greece was an outstanding success. This is a precedent to be followed. It settled the question once and for all with no hang-over&quot;. In September 1943, Dalton wrote to Attlee about what course to pursue after the war, saying: &quot;It would be total lunacy to fight an election, if could be avoided, against the present Prime Minister with the laurels of victory upon his brows...therefore, my simple plan is, though it might be impossible to execute it, to continue the all-party government and screw as much good policy as we could out of our colleagues while it lasted until such time as we could fight a general election and &quot;win it&quot; with a Labour majority&quot;. 

In his first draft of his foreign policy paper presented on 12 November 1943, Dalton stated that he favoured continuing the &quot;Big Three&quot; alliance of the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom to become &quot;the solid nucleus of a world organization&quot; working together to uphold peace after the war. He also called for Allied occupations of both Japan and Germany; for both Japan and Germany to be completely disarmed forever; and for Anglo-American-Soviet control of the German economic and financial system. Much of his paper was given over to German &quot;responsibility&quot; for the war and war crimes. Dalton argued that millions of Germans were involved in Nazi war crimes in one way or another as he stated the German working class which was &quot;doing their utmost&quot; to sustain the German war effort by building weapons for the Wehrmacht were just as guilty of war crimes as members of the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party and the Wehrmacht. Dalton wrote that there were &quot;good Germans&quot;, but &quot;they are singularly ineffective in restraining the bad Germans.&quot; In a repudiation of the protectionism that characterised the world economy in the Great Depression, Dalton called for a comprehensive effort to lower tariffs on both goods and services for the entire world as he argued Britain would benefit from more free trade and less protectionism. 

The principal objection to Dalton&#x27;s foreign policy paper came from the Labour MP Philip Noel-Baker who disliked the idea of the leaders of the &quot;Big Three&quot; alliance deciding the fate of the world and wanted some sort of international organisation to be in charge of the post-war world. In the final draft submitted on 7 March 1944, Dalton called for the permanent disarmament of Germany, a lengthy occupation of Germany, the reduction of any industry that could be used for military purposes and international control of the German economy, punishment for all war criminals, for Germany to pay reparations to the Allied powers and the expulsion of the &quot;volksdeutsche&quot; minorities from Eastern Europe with the only exceptions being for those willing to be &quot;loyal subjects&quot;. The sections dealing with Germany drew objections from Noel-Baker, Harold Laski and Jim Griffiths who complained about the call for reparations and Dalton&#x27;s use of the word &quot;German&quot; in place of &quot;Nazi&quot;, which seemed to imply a sort of German collective guilt. Noel-Baker in particular objected to Dalton&#x27;s sentence about &quot;the calculated German plan to kill all Jews in Europe&quot;, saying he wanted the statement to instead say &quot;the calculated Nazi plan to kill all the Jews in Europe&quot;. Dalton also declared his support for Zionism as his paper called for a post-war Labour government to work to establish a Jewish state in the Palestine Mandate after the war. On Palestine, Dalton wrote that Jews should be encouraged to &quot;enter this tiny land in such numbers as to become a majority. There was a strong case for this before the War. There is an irresistible case now, after the unspeakable atrocities of the cold and calculated German Nazi plan to kill all the Jews in Europe. Here too, in Palestine surely is a case on human grounds, to promote a stable settlement, for the transfer of population. Let the Arabs be encouraged to move out as the Jews move in&quot;. Dalton argued that Palestine was less than half the size of Wales; that the Arab world was large; and the Palestinians should be financially compensated for agreeing to leave Palestine. Finally, he called for extending the size of the projected Jewish state and called for talks with Egypt, Syria and Transjordan (modern Jordan) about transferring more territory. Dalton&#x27;s paper drew opposition from Aneurin Bevan who charged that his paper was too harsh towards Germany and would drive the Germans towards supporting the Nazi regime, which was clearly losing the war by this point. 

Dalton&#x27;s paper was important as preparation for a general election. By 1944, Dalton was complaining that there was too much difference of opinion between Labour, Liberal and Conservative ministers on matters of social and economic policies, and that the wartime spirit of unity would not last after the war. Dalton still hoped to keep the coalition government going after the war, but he felt that hope was becoming increasingly unrealistic. The most important bill Dalton passed in the Churchill government was the Distribution of Industry Act, which he introduced in 1944, which called for the government to encourage industries to relocate to the economically depressed areas of the North of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The way that Churchill strongly hinted to Dalton that he intended to repeal the Distribution of Industry Act after the war was for him another example of the impossibility of continuing the coalition. In February 1944, Dalton complained about the slow pace of reaching a common position with the Dominions on trade, declaring &quot;it is incredible how these rambling discussions succeed one another with no new arguments and no one ever changing sides and never any firm decisions&quot;. The Labour Australian prime minister John Curtin was committed to a Keynesian policy of seeking full employment after the war as he vowed that Australia would never be ravaged by a depression again. Besides his full employment policies, Curtin wanted to sponsor the industrialisation of Australia, which was still in its early stages as Australia was a more rural nation in the 1940s than today. For all these reasons, Curtin was especially hostile towards ending the Imperial Preference system as he believed that ending tariffs on American goods would be the end of Australia&#x27;s industrialisation along with any prospect of full employment. Dalton believed that lower tariffs would mean lower prices for goods, especially food, for the British people and that the expanded trade with the United States caused by lowering tariffs would be crucial for Britain&#x27;s postwar economic recovery. At a cabinet meeting in February 1944, Dalton was the subject of much abuse by Lord Beaverbook, a long-standing advocate of Imperial Preference. When Beaverbrook claimed that the government of his native Canada wanted to keep the Imperial Preference system, Dalton flatly told him that he was wrong and the Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King wanted a multilateral economic order with lower tariffs amongst the nations of the West. An angry Beaverbrook replied that when the Canadian people learned what Mackenzie King wanted, there would be a &quot;revolution&quot; in Canada. At a Commonwealth economic conference in London in February–March 1944, the Canadian delegation wanted a 50% reduction in tariffs after war the while the British delegation wanted a 25% reduction and South African, New Zealand and especially Australian delegations wanted to continue the Imperial Preference tariffs after the war. On 14 April 1944, Dalton along with Richard Law presented a proposal for a &quot;Commercial Union&quot; with the United States that was intended to gradually phrase out all Anglo-American tariffs that led to such opposition from Amery that the proposal was dropped. Dalton&#x27;s paper was accepted as the basis for a Labour government&#x27;s post-war foreign policy at a conference in London between 11–15 December 1944. Despite the pro-Zionist stance of his paper, Dalton&#x27;s statements about &quot;population transfers&quot; as the solution to problems of Palestine created opposition from the Jewish Agency (the semi-official agency in charge of the Jewish population of Palestine), which feared that would rule out any possibility of a compromise with the Palestinian Arabs.
In 1945, Dalton announced that Labour would only win a general election &quot;with the votes of the football crowd&quot;, arguing that Labour needed to take a populist stance that would appeal to working class men who were not necessarily socialists but were only loyal to their local football clubs. When Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, it was not clear if Labour would press for a general election by leaving the coalition government or continue the coalition until the war with Japan was won. Dalton favoured continuing the coalition government headed by Churchill into peacetime, but at a Labour Party conference in Blackpool on 19 May 1945 the delegates led by Herbert Morrison voted overwhelmingly to leave the coalition and thus force a general election.

==Chancellor of the Exchequer==
=== Appointment ===

After the unexpected Labour victory in the 1945 general election Dalton wished to become Foreign Secretary, but the job was instead given to Ernest Bevin. Dalton, with his skills in economics, became Chancellor of the Exchequer. Alongside Bevin, Clement Attlee, Herbert Morrison and Stafford Cripps, Dalton was one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; of the Labour government.

In his biography of Attlee and Churchill, Leo McKinstry wrote: &quot;Attlee had initially decided that two of the other most vital jobs, the Treasury and the Foreign Office, should be filled by Bevin and Dalton respectively. But the King had baulked at the idea of Dalton as Foreign Secretary, seeing him as untrustworthy and partisan. Similarly, the Foreign Office exerted pressure against Dalton, the outgoing Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden declaring that ‘it should be Bevin’.&quot; In 1944, Dalton, a Zionist, called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. He argued for population transfer, stating, &quot;Let the Arabs be encouraged to move out, as the Jews move in.&quot; He went even further and discussed the possibility of &quot;extending the present Palestinian boundaries, by agreement with Egypt, Syria, or Trans-Jordan.&quot; In private, Dalton often referred to people of colour as &quot;diseased nigger communities&quot; or &quot;wogs.&quot; Between 1945–1948, the three principal Zionist groups in Palestine, the Haganah on the left and the Irgun and Lehi (which the British called the &quot;Stern Gang&quot;) on the right waged a guerrilla struggle against the British. Dalton for all his support for Zionism was described as being &quot;appalled&quot; by the attacks on British soldiers and policemen, especially by the ruthless tactics of the Irgun and Stern Gang.

=== Economic policy ===
The Treasury faced urgent problems. Half of the wartime economy had been devoted to mobilizing soldiers, warplanes, bombs and munitions; an urgent transition to a peacetime budget was necessary, while minimizing inflation. Financial aid through Lend Lease from the United States was abruptly and unexpectedly terminated in September 1945, and new loans and cash grants from the United States and Canada were essential to keep living conditions tolerable. In the long run, Labour was committed to nationalization of industry and national planning of the economy, to more taxation of the rich and less of the poor, and to expanding the welfare state and creating free medical services for everyone.
During the war, most overseas investments had been sold to fund the cost of its prosecution (the state thus losing the income from them), and Britain suffered severe balance of payments problems. The $3.75 billion 50-year American loan negotiated by John Maynard Keynes in 1946 (and the $1.25 billion loan from Canada) was soon exhausted. By 1947, rationing had to be tightened and the convertibility of the pound suspended. In the atmosphere of crisis, Morrison and Cripps intrigued to replace Attlee with Bevin as prime minister; Bevin refused to play along, and Attlee bought off Cripps by giving him Morrison&#x27;s responsibilities for economic planning. Ironically, of the &quot;Big Five&quot; it was Dalton who ultimately fell victim to the events of that year.

Cheaper money—that is, low interest rates—was an important goal for Dalton during his Chancellorship. He wanted to avoid the high interest rates and unemployment experienced after the First World War, and to keep down the cost of nationalization. He gained support for this cheaper money policy from Keynes, as well as from officials of the Bank of England and the Treasury. Dalton supported independence for India, saying in a 1946 speech: &quot;If you are in a place where you are not wanted, and where you have not got the force, or perhaps the will, to quash those who don&#x27;t want you, the only thing to do is come out&quot;. Dalton complained that subsiding the Greek government, which was losing a civil war against Communist guerrillas, was costing the British treasury too much and advised ending the subsidies. By contrast, Bevin who was serving as Foreign Secretary, pressed for continuing aid to Greece. Bevin argued if the Communists won the Greek Civil War, the new government in Athens would grant air and naval bases to the Soviet Union, which in turn would allow the Soviets to dominate the eastern Mediterranean Sea, which in effect would be the same as severing the Suez canal. In early 1947, there was a vigorous debate between Dalton and Bevin about subsiding the Greek government, which was won by Dalton who argued that HMG could not longer afford the subsidies. In this way, Dalton played an important role in triggering what came to be known as the Truman Doctrine as the United States was informed that Britain would cease subsiding Greece as of 1 April 1947, and if the Americans wanted to stop the Greek Communists from winning the civil war, they would have to take action.

=== Budget ===
Budgetary policy under Dalton was strongly progressive, as characterised by policies such as increased food subsidies, heavily subsidised rents to council house tenants, the lifting of restrictions on housebuilding, the financing of national assistance and family allowances, and extensive assistance to rural communities and Development Areas. Dalton was also responsible for funding the introduction of Britain&#x27;s universal family allowances scheme, doing so &quot;with a song in my heart&quot;, as he later put it. 

In one of his budgets, Dalton significantly increased spending on education (which included £4 million for the universities and the provision of free school milk), £38 million for the start (from August 1946) of family allowances, and an additional £10 million for Development Areas. In addition, the National Land Fund was established. Harold Macmillan, who inherited Dalton&#x27;s housing responsibilities when the Conservatives returned to power in 1951, later acknowledged his debt to Dalton&#x27;s championing of New Towns, and was grateful for the legacy of Dalton&#x27;s Town Development Bill, which encouraged urban overfill schemes and the movement of industry out of cities.

Food subsidies were maintained at high wartime levels in order to restrain living costs, while taxation structures were altered to benefit low-wage earners, with some 2.5 million workers taken out of the tax system altogether in Dalton&#x27;s first two budgets. There were also increases in surtax and death duties, which were opposed by the Opposition. According to one historian, Dalton&#x27;s policies as Chancellor reflected &quot;an unprecedented emphasis by central government on the redistribution of income&quot;.

====Budget-leaking and resignation====
Walking into the House of Commons to give the autumn 1947 budget speech, Dalton made an off-the-cuff remark to a journalist, telling him of some of the tax changes in the budget. The news was printed in the early edition of the evening papers before he had completed his speech, and whilst the stock market was still open. This was a scandal, and led to his resignation for leaking a budget secret. He was succeeded by Stafford Cripps. Though initially implicated in the allegations that led to the Lynskey tribunal in 1948, he was ultimately exonerated officially, but his reputation suffered another blow.

===Return to cabinet===
Dalton returned to the cabinet in 1948, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, making him a minister without portfolio. He became Minister of Town and Country Planning in 1950, the position being renamed as Minister of Local Government and Planning the following year. An avid outdoorsman, he served a term as president of the Ramblers Association, which promoted walking tours. As Chancellor in 1946 he had started the National Land Fund to resource national parks, and in 1951 he approved the Pennine Way, which involved the creation of 70 additional miles of rights of way. He still had the ear of the Prime Minister, and enjoyed promoting the careers of candidates with potential, but was no longer a major political player as he had been until 1947. In October 1950, a group of intellectuals from Communist China led by the writer Liu Ningyi visited Britain, and Dalton along with Bevan were assigned to meet the Chinese delegation. Liu read out a threatening statement saying that China would &quot;not stand aside&quot; from the Korean War and would intervene (in fact, Chinese forces had already crossed the Yalu river into North Korea) and accused the Labour government of being unfriendly towards China. In response, an angry Dalton told Liu that he had not met anyone who represented &quot;real British&quot; opinion and compared his visit, meeting only people associated with the British Communist Party, to a Labour Party delegation in China ruled by the Kuomingtang. In November–December 1950, Dalton expressed much concern about the Korean War escalating into a Third World War, arguing that the world was in a highly dangerous situation when China and the United States fighting each other in Korea. Dalton urged Attlee to visit Washington D.C. to meet the American president Harry S. Truman to seek assurances that the United States would not use nuclear weapons and/or seek to escalate the Korean war into an all-out Sino-American war. Attlee visited Washington between 4–8 December 1949 for an emergency summit with Truman and reported that Truman had ruled out the use of nuclear weapons and escalation of the war. In 1951, the writer Monica Felton visited North Korea, China and the Soviet Union. In a radio broadcast from Moscow, she accused American forces of committing Nazi-style crimes in Korea. Upon her return to Britain, Dalton had her sacked from the Ministry of Local Government. He left government after Labour lost the 1951 general election.
===Later years===
Dalton lost his place (elected by party members, who in this era were Bevanite in their sympathies) on the Labour National Executive Committee in 1952. Dalton retired from the Shadow Cabinet in 1955, after thirty years as a front-bencher, and stood down from Parliament in the 1959 general election. He was made a Life Peer in 1960, but died two years later on 13 February 1962.

==Personal life==
In 1914 Dalton married Ruth with whom he had a daughter who died in infancy in the early 1920s.

Dalton&#x27;s biographer, Ben Pimlott, accepts that Dalton had homosexual tendencies but concludes he never acted on them, stating that &quot;no evidence exists that Dalton ever had a sexual relationship with another man, and his private life seems to have been one of blameless monogamy.&quot; 

Michael Bloch, on the other hand, thinks that Dalton&#x27;s love for Rupert Brooke, whom he met at Cambridge University&#x27;s Fabian Society, went beyond the platonic, citing bike rides in the countryside and sleeping naked under the stars. In 1908, Dalton also made advances at James Strachey, &quot;waving an immense steaming penis in his face and chuckling softly&quot;, as Brooke reported to James&#x27; brother Lytton.

In later life, Dalton seems to have refrained from sexual relationships with men, though he kept a fatherly interest in the career of various young men (such as Hugh Gaitskell, Richard Crossman and Tony Crosland, who had been noted for their good looks and had had same-sex experiences at Oxford) and was rather touchy-feely with them. In 1951, Dalton wrote to Crossman: &quot;Thinking of Tony, with all his youth and beauty and gaiety and charm... I weep. I am more fond of that young man than I can put into words.&quot; According to Nicholas Davenport Dalton&#x27;s unrequited feelings for Crosland became an embarrassing joke within the Labour Party.

Dalton&#x27;s papers, including his diaries, are held at the LSE Library. His diaries have been digitised and are available on LSE&#x27;s Digital Library.

==Awards==
Dalton was president of the Ramblers&#x27; Association from 1948 to 1950, and Master of the Drapers&#x27; Company in 1958–59. He was created a life peer as Baron Dalton, &quot;of Forest and Frith in the County Palatine of Durham on 28 January 1960.

== Contributions in economics ==
Dalton substantially expanded Max Otto Lorenz&#x27;s work in the measurement of income inequality, offering both an expanded array of techniques but also a set of principles by which to comprehend shifts in an income distribution, thereby providing a more compelling theoretical basis for understanding relationships between incomes (1920).

Following a suggestion by Pigou (1912, p. 24), Dalton proposed the condition that a transfer of income from a richer to a poorer person, so long as that transfer does not reverse the ranking of the two, will result in greater equity (Dalton, p. 351). This principle has come to be known as the Pigou–Dalton principle (see, e.g., Amartya Sen, 1973).

Dalton offered a theoretical proposition of a positive functional relationship between income and economic welfare, stating that economic welfare increases at an exponentially decreasing rate with increased income, leading to the conclusion that maximum social welfare is achievable only when all incomes are equal.

<text>Edmund &quot;Ed&quot; Kuepper (born 20 December 1955) is a German-born Australian guitarist, vocalist and songwriter. He co-founded the punk band The Saints in 1973, the experimental post-punk group Laughing Clowns (active 1979–85) and the grunge-like The Aints! (1991–94, 2017–present). He has also recorded over a dozen albums as a solo artist using a variety of backing bands. His highest charting solo album, &quot;Honey Steel&#x27;s Gold&quot;, appeared in November 1991 and reached No. 28 on the ARIA Albums Chart. His other top 50 albums are &quot;Black Ticket Day&quot; (August 1992), &quot;Serene Machine&quot; (March 1993) and &quot;Character Assassination&quot; (August 1994). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993 he won Best Independent Release for &quot;Black Ticket Day&quot; and won the same category in 1994 for &quot;Serene Machine&quot;.

== Biography ==
Edmund Kuepper was born on 20 December 1955 in Bremen, then part of West Germany. His family migrated to Australia in the 1960s and settled in Brisbane. He attended Oxley State High School and Corinda State High School with Chris Bailey and Ivor Hay.

=== 1973–1978===

Ed Kuepper&#x27;s music career began in 1973 when he formed The Saints in Brisbane initially as a garage band, Kid Galahad and the Eternals. The line-up was Kuepper on lead guitar, Chris Bailey on lead vocals and Ivor Hay on piano. Early in the next year Hay switched to bass guitar and Jeffrey Wegener joined on drums, and they were renamed as The Saints.

Their early sound was a hybrid of Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Pretty Things, and The Stooges; it &quot;eventually coalesced into [their] own distinctive sound as defined by Kuepper&#x27;s frenetic, whirlwind guitar style and Bailey&#x27;s arrogant snarl&quot; according to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane. By 1975 Hay switched to drums when Wegener left and Kym Bradshaw joined on bass guitar. The group had difficulty finding performance venues, and converted Bailey and Hay&#x27;s share-house into a music venue, Club 76.

In 1976, the group wanted to record their material but found no interest from the Brisbane music industry. In September of that year they set up their own marketing company, Eternal Promotions and their own label, Fatal Records. They pressed 500 copies of their debut single, &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot; co-written by Kuepper and Bailey. The track was lauded by Jonh Ingham of &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine as the &quot;single of this and every week&quot;. In November the group were signed to EMI which quickly pressed their single and by December issued an album of the same name.

The group relocated to Sydney and then London, by May 1977, where they were promoted as punk rockers, however they eschewed &quot;the spiky-topped, safety-pinned style of the leading UK punk groups&quot;. Kuepper noted &quot;[The Saints] was a full thing by 1974. Two and a half years later, this incredibly fashionable movement comes along, only an arsehole would have associated himself with that&quot;.

Kuepper remained with The Saints until late in 1978 by which time they had issued &quot;Eternally Yours&quot; (May 1978) and &quot;Prehistoric Sounds&quot; (October). According to McFarlane, Bailey had wanted &quot;three-chord rockers and pop songs&quot; while Kuepper preferred &quot;less commercial, more cerebral material&quot;. Kuepper left the group, returned to Australia, and The Saints continued with Bailey using a variable line-up.

===1979–1985: Laughing Clowns ===
Kuepper returned to Sydney late in 1978 and considered retiring from the music industry. However, in April 1979 he launched Laughing Clowns as a rock, soul and avant-jazz group. He provided lead guitar, lead vocals and banjo, with former bandmate Wegener on drums, Bob Farrell on saxophone, and Ben Wallace-Crabbe on bass guitar. Early in the next year, Ben&#x27;s cousin Dan Wallace-Crabbe (ex-Crime &amp; the City Solution guitarist) joined on piano. In May 1980, they issued their debut self-titled six-track EP on Missing Link Records, which was produced by Kuepper. AllMusic&#x27;s John Bush described their sound as &quot;jazzier and quite a bit more experimental than&quot; The Saints.

Meanwhile, Kuepper and the group&#x27;s manager, Ken West, started up their own label, Prince Melon Records, to release Laughing Clowns material. Laughing Clowns subsequently issued three studio albums, &quot;Mr Uddich Schmuddich Goes to Town&quot; (May 1982), &quot; Law of Nature&quot; (April 1984), and &quot;Ghosts of an Ideal Wife&quot; (June 1985) the last two on the Hot label. During July 1984 Kuepper rejoined The Saints on bass guitar as a touring musician alongside Bailey, Chris Burnham on lead guitar, and Iain Shedden on drums. However &quot;old conflicts arose and he left&quot; according to McFarlane. Laughing Clowns disbanded early in 1985 and Kuepper started his solo career.

=== 1985–1990: Early solo career ===

Early in 1985, Kuepper released &quot;Electrical Storm&quot; (June 1985), co-produced with Bruce Callaway (New Christs) and released by Hot Records. For the album he provided vocals, guitars: electric, acoustic and bass, and mandolin; he also used Callaway on guitar, Nick Fisher on drums, and Louis Tillett on piano. McFarlane describes the album as &quot;stark and angular&quot;. While Bush felt it was &quot;surprisingly pop-oriented&quot;.

In the following year he formed a backing band, The Yard Goes on Forever, with Michael Arthur on guitar; Louis Burdett (ex-Powerhouse) on drums, replaced a month later by Mark Dawson (ex-John Kennedy&#x27;s Love Gone Wrong); and Paul Smith on bass guitar (ex-Laughing Clowns). As well as touring he used the group, with additional session musicians, to record his second studio album, &quot;Rooms of the Magnificent&quot; (September 1986). It was produced by Kuepper and appeared on Hot Records for the UK market and True Tone Records for the Australian market.

A third solo album, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got To&quot;, appeared in February 1988 on Hot Records (UK), True Tone Records (Australia), and on Capitol Records for United States release. McFarlane noted his second and third albums had &quot;consolidated the band&#x27;s impressive live standing and contained many fine examples of guitar/horn-driven rock&quot;. While AllMusic&#x27;s Dan LeRoy praised its &quot;tight, polished alt-rock&quot; sound as &quot;perhaps his finest album ever&quot;. His fellow reviewer Bush related that it &quot;failed to click with radio programmers or the public&quot;. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Nothing Changes in My House&quot;, had been released in November 1987 and reached the ARIA Singles Chart Top 100. A four-track EP, &quot;Happy as Hell&quot;, was issued in 1989 before Kuepper changed his musical direction.

=== 1990–1994: The Aints and more solo work ===
Kuepper and Dawson worked on an acoustic album, &quot;Today Wonder&quot; (October 1990), which McFarlane described as recorded &quot;using unconventional guitar effects and an unusual drumkit&quot;, the pair proving &quot;less is more with a mix of new tunes and covers&quot;. Australian journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, felt that the album had &quot;changed the tide. Suddenly [Kuepper] was in favour again&quot; whereas his previous material had &quot;seemed to fall on deaf ears&quot;. Kuepper and Dawson also formed a side project, Mephisto Waltz, with Chris Abrahams on piano, which toured and performed &quot;ambient instrumental&quot; music with &quot;unconventional sounds&quot; but they did not record any material.

In April 1991, Kuepper formed a grunge-like band, The Aints, with Kuepper on guitar and vocals; and initially the line-up had Tim Reeves on drums; and Kent Steedman (also in The Celibate Rifles) on bass guitar. McFarlane noted that they quickly released &quot;three fiery, distortion-drenched albums&quot;: &quot;S.L.S.Q&quot; (May 1991), &quot;Ascension&quot; (December) and &quot;Auto-cannibalism&quot; (June 1992). McFarlane further elaborated that with &quot;blistering, guitar-heavy tracks ... these albums were the antithesis of Ed&#x27;s solo work&quot;.

Kuepper continued his solo releases with another album, &quot;Honey Steel&#x27;s Gold&quot;, appearing in November 1991, which peaked at No. 28 on the ARIA Albums Chart – his highest position on the Australian charts to date. According to McFarlane it was also the &quot;highest mainstream placement for an independent album to that time&quot;. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 he was nominated for Best Independent Release for the album. Kuepper won Best Independent Australian Release in 1993, for &quot;Black Ticket Day&quot; (August 1992), and in 1994 for &quot;Serene Machine&quot; (March 1993). &quot;Black Ticket Day&quot; and &quot;Serence Machine&quot; had each reached No. 45.

=== 1994–current: Later career===

Ed Kuepper&#x27;s next album, &quot;Character Assassination&quot; (August 1994), peaked at No.32. It was nominated for an ARIA Award in 1995. Further nomination occurred in 1996 for &quot;The Exotic Mail Order Moods of Ed Kuepper&quot; (October 1995), 1997 for &quot;Frontierland&quot; (September 1996) and &quot;Starstruck: Music for Films &amp; Adverts&quot; (March 1997), and 1998 for &quot;Live! with His Oxley Creek Playboys&quot; (June 1998).

During the early 1990s he was one of Australia&#x27;s most prolific recording artists. He has recorded more than twenty solo albums using a variety of backing bands including His Oxley Creek Playboys, he Institute of Nude Wrestling, The Exploding Universe of Ed Kuepper, the New Imperialists, and the Kowalski Collective. Bush noted that &quot;Despite his very appreciative cult of fans and torrid release schedule, Kuepper has not managed a breakthrough to wide popular acclaim&quot;.

Kuepper has also been involved in sound tracking radio drama and experimental films. During 2004, he toured Australia and Europe performing semi-improvised music to some of these films under the banner of Music for Len Lye (MFLL). Len Lye (1901–1980) was an artist known for experimental films and kinetic sculpture. Venues included the Institute of Modern Art (Brisbane), Sydney Opera House, the Austrian Film Museum (Vienna) and the Cartier Foundation (Paris), where Kuepper was the only rock musician to be invited apart from Velvet Underground.

2007 saw the release of Kuepper&#x27;s &quot;Jean Lee and the Yellow Dog&quot; album, which was inspired by the story of Jean Lee who was the last woman hanged in Australia, and features amongst others, performances by Jeffrey Wegener (Laughing Clowns), Peter Oxley (Sunnyboys), Warren Ellis (Dirty Three), and Chris Bailey (The Saints).

After extensive touring in 2008 opening for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds Kuepper joined Cave&#x27;s band as a touring guitarist upon the departure of founding member Mick Harvey in early 2009. Kuepper also relaunched Prince Melon Records.

In March 2012, Kuepper released &quot;Second Winter&quot;, containing songs from the &quot;Electrical Storm&quot; and &quot;Rooms of the Magnificent&quot; albums with completely new arrangements and feel in the vein of &quot;Today Wonder&quot;.

After spending most of 2013 on the road, performing a series of &quot;Solo and By Request&quot; shows, Kuepper released &quot;The Return of the Mail-Order Bridegroom&quot;, the second instalment in a &quot;mail-order&quot; series, containing reworked acoustic versions of songs by his former bands The Saints and Laughing Clowns, as well as new versions of his solo material and songs popularised by artists including Jimi Hendrix and The Walker Brothers.

In 2015, Kuepper provided the soundtrack for the film &quot;Last Cab to Darwin.&quot;

=== The Saints reunions ===
In addition to his brief 1984 stint as a touring bassist with the Saints, in September 2001 Kuepper and the original line-up of The Saints came together for a one-off reunion, when they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.

On 14 July 2007, Kuepper, Chris Bailey and original drummer Ivor Hay re-united for another one-off gig at the Queensland Music Festival, with a more recent Saints member, Caspar Wijnberg, on bass guitar.

In January 2009, as part of the All Tomorrows Parties touring festival – curated by Mick Harvey, The Saints with Kuepper, Bailey, Hay, and Arturo LaRizza played shows in Brisbane, Sydney and in Mount Buller, Victoria. This was followed by a Melbourne show on 14 January as part of the Don&#x27;t Look Back sideshow concerts, where they performed the &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot; album in its entirety.

In May 2010, Kuepper &amp; Bailey reunited for a monthlong tri-residency series of shows in Brisbane, Sydney &amp; Melbourne. With Kuepper on electric guitar/vocals &amp; Bailey on acoustic guitar/bass guitar/vocals they played a selection of songs from both solo careers and post-Kuepper &quot;Saints&quot;, as well as a few covers.

In late 1979, at a performance by Laughing Clowns in Sydney, Ed Kuepper met arts student and photographer Judi Dransfield—the couple later married. Since 1994, Dransfield-Kuepper has supplied art work, photography or illustrations for various Kuepper-related albums.

<doc id="538413" wikidata="Q388952" url="?curid=538413" title="Friesian horse">
<text>The Friesian ( in Dutch; in West Frisian) is a horse breed originating in Friesland in north Netherlands. The breed nearly became extinct on more than one occasion. It is classified as a light draught horse, and the modern day Friesian horse is used for riding and driving. The Friesian horse is most known for its all-black coat colour, its long flowing mane and tail, feathering on its legs, a high head carriage, and high stepping action.

== Breed characteristics ==

The breed has powerful overall conformation and good bone structure, with what is sometimes called a Baroque body type. Friesians have long arched necks, well-chiseled short-ears, and Spanish-type heads. They have sloping shoulders, compact muscular bodies with sloping hindquarters and a low-set tail. Limbs are short and strong, with feathering—long hair on the lower legs. A Friesian horse also has a long, thick mane and tail, often wavy. The breed is known for a brisk, high-stepping trot.

The Friesian is considered willing, active, and energetic, but also gentle and docile. A Friesian tends to have great presence and to carry itself with elegance.

Today, there are two distinct conformation types—the &quot;baroque&quot; type, which has the more robust build of the classical Friesian, and the modern, &quot;sport horse&quot; type, which is finer-boned. Both types are common, though the modern type is currently more popular in the show ring than is the baroque Friesian. However, conformation type is considered less important than correct movement.

=== Size ===

The Friesian stands on average about , although it may vary from at the withers, and mares or geldings must be at least to qualify for a &quot;star-designation&quot; pedigree.

=== Colour ===

Friesians rarely have white markings of any kind; most registries allow only a small star on the forehead for purebred registration.

Though Friesian horses are characteristically black, occasionally chestnut colouring appears, as some bloodlines do carry the &quot;red&quot; (&quot;e&quot;) gene. In the 1930s, chestnuts and bays were seen. The chestnut colour is generally not acceptable for stallions, though it is sometimes allowed for mares and geldings. A chestnut-coloured Friesian that competes is penalised. Discoloration from old injuries or a black coat fading from the sun is not penalised.

In 1990, the began to attempt breeding out the chestnut colour, and today stallions undergo genetic testing. If testing indicates the presence of the chestnut or &quot;red&quot; gene, even if heterozygous and masked by black colour, the horse is not accepted for registration with the FPS. In 2014 there were eight stallion lines known to still carry the chestnut gene.

The American Friesian Association, which is not affiliated with the FPS, allows horses with white markings and/or chestnut colour to be registered if purebred parentage can be proven.

=== Genetic disorders ===

There are four genetic disorders acknowledged by the industry that may affect horses of Friesian breeding: dwarfism, hydrocephalus, a tendency for aortic rupture, and megaesophagus. There are genetic tests for the first two conditions. The Friesian is also among several breeds that may develop equine polysaccharide storage myopathy. Approximately 0.25% of Friesians are affected by dwarfism, which results in horses with a normal-sized head, a broader chest than normal, an abnormally long back and very short limbs. It is a recessive condition. Additionally, the breed has a higher-than-usual rate of digestive system disorders, and a greater tendency to have insect bite hypersensitivity. Like other feathered draught breeds, they are prone to a skin condition called verrucous pastern dermatopathy and may be generally prone to having a compromised immune system. Friesian mares have a very high 54% rate of retained placenta after foaling. Some normal-sized Friesians also have a propensity toward tendon and ligament laxity which may or may not be associated with dwarfism. The relatively small gene pool and inbreeding are thought to be factors behind most of these disorders.

== History ==

The Friesian originates in the province of Friesland in the northern Netherlands, where there is evidence of thousands of years of horse populations.

As far back in history as the 4th century there are mentions of Friesian troops which rode their own horses. One of the most well-known sources of this was by an English writer named Anthony Dent who wrote about the Friesian mounted troops in Carlisle. Dent, amongst others, wrote that the Friesian horse was the ancestor of both the British Shire horse and Fell pony, however, this is speculation.

It was not until the 11th century, that there were illustrations of what appeared to be Friesians. Many of the illustrations found depict knights riding horses which resemble the breed, with one of the most famous examples being William the Conqueror.

These ancestors of the modern Friesians were used in medieval times to carry knights to battle. In the 12th and 13th centuries, some eastern horses of crusaders were mated with Friesian stock. During the 16th and 17th centuries, when the Netherlands were briefly linked with Spain, there was less demand for heavy war horses, as battle arms changed and became lighter. Andalusian horses were bred with Friesians, producing a lighter horse more suitable for work as an urban carriage horse.

Historian Ann Hyland wrote of the Friesian breed:
The breed was especially popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, when they were in demand not only as harness horses and for agricultural work, but also for the trotting races so popular then. In the 1800s, the Friesian was bred to be lighter and faster for trotting, but this led to what some owners and breeders regarded as inferior stock, so a movement to return to pureblood stock took place at the end of the 19th century. 
A studbook society was founded in 1879 by Frisian farmers and landowners who had gathered to found the (FRS) The (horse stud book) was published in 1880 and initially registered both Friesian horses and a group of heavy warmblood breeds, including Ostfriesen and Alt-Oldenburgers, collectively known as &quot;Bovenlanders&quot;. At the time, the Friesian horse was declining in numbers, and was being replaced by the more fashionable Bovenlanders, both directly, and by crossbreeding &quot;Bovenlander&quot; stallions on Friesian mares. This had already virtually exterminated the pure Friesian in significant parts of the province in 1879, which made the inclusion of Bovenlanders necessary. While the work of the society led to a revival of the breed in the late 19th century, it also resulted in the sale and disappearance of many of the best stallions from the breeding area, and Friesian horse populations dwindled. By the early 20th century, the number of available breeding stallions was down to three. Therefore, in 1906, the two parts of the registry were joined, and the studbook was renamed the (FPS) in 1907.&quot;

In 1913 a society, , was founded to protect and promote the breed. By 1915 it had convinced FPS to split registration into two groups. By 1943, the breeders of non-Friesian horses left the FPS completely to form a separate association, which later became the &quot;Koninklijk Warmbloed Paardenstamboek Nederland&quot; (Royal Warmblood Studbook of the Netherlands (KWPN).

Displacement by mechanical farm equipment on dairy farms also was a threat to the survival of Friesian horse. The last draught function performed by Friesians on a significant scale was on farms that raised dairy cattle. World War II slowed the process of displacement, allowing the population and popularity of the breed to rebound. Important in the initial stage of the recovery of the breed was due to the family owned Circus Strassburger, who, having fled Nazi Germany for the Low Countries, discovered the show qualities of the breed and demonstrated its abilities outside of its local breeding area during and after the Nazi occupation

== Uses ==

As use in agricultural pursuits declined, the Friesian became popular for recreational uses. Today, about seven percent of the horses in the Netherlands are Friesians.

The Friesian horse today is used both in harness and under saddle, particularly in the discipline of dressage. In harness, they are used for competitive and recreational driving. A traditional carriage seen in some events designed for Friesian horses is a high-wheeled cart called a . Friesians are also used to pull vintage carriages at ceremonial events and parades.

Because of their color and striking appearance, Friesian horses are a popular breed in movies and television, particularly in historic and fantasy dramas. They are viewed as calm in the face of the activity associated with filmmaking, but also elegant on-camera.

== Registration of breeding ==
 (KFPS), which means &quot;Royal Association, The Friesian Horse Studbook&quot;, is the original Friesian studbook founded in 1879 in the Netherlands and is the world-recognized official studbook for the Friesian horse breed. KFPS has licensed about 30 organizations around the world as authorized representatives to uphold its breeding program standards, record registrations and arrange horse evaluations. Most KFPS-registered horses are in the Netherlands, Germany and North America. 

KFPS studbook breeding is strictly controlled, and breeding a KFPS-registered and approved stallion to any non-KFPS mares or to any other breed of horse is strongly discouraged. Other registries exist for Friesians and Friesian crossbreeds, but KFPS does not permit dual registration.

For a stallion to be approved as breeding stock it must pass a rigorous approval process. Horses are judged at an inspection, or , by Dutch judges, who decide whether the horse is worthy of breeding.

There are multiple registries within KFPS. The two main registries are the &quot;studbook&quot; for approved stallions, and the &quot;foalbook&quot; for horses from the mating of an approved stallion and a mare in the foalbook. There are two auxiliary registries:
* &quot;B-Book I&quot; is for horses from a mating with a limited-approved stallion. In countries where approved-stallion stock is low, some stallions are given limited breeding rights, and their offspring can be registered in B-Book I with the possibility of upgrading to a higher studbook grade after three successive generations of breeding by KFPS approved studbook stallions. North America is one of the regions outside Netherlands with a sufficient number of approved stallions available such that there has been no B-Book I registering since 1992.
* &quot;B-Book II&quot; is for horses from the mating of two purebred Friesians, but the stallion is not approved. Such offspring must be registered directly with KFPS in Netherlands.

There are a few special status awards that can be obtained during evaluation events, such as a &quot;star predicate&quot; which is awarded to a mare, gelding, or unapproved stallion that meets minimum standards of conformation, movement, and minimum height; and a &quot;sport predicate&quot; is awarded to horses that have achieved certain performance goals in dressage or driving competitions.

KFPS-registered horses born prior to 1997 had tongue tattoos; horses born after have a microchip implant in the upper left neck. The tattoo or chip numbers are recorded on the registration papers. Names given to foals born in a certain year must begin with a fixed letter as determined by KFPS. Parentage is verified with DNA testing, and mares are DNA tested for hydrocephalus and dwarfism unless their sire and dam had both tested as non-carriers.

<doc id="538415" wikidata="Q33060" url="?curid=538415" title="Blackfoot language">
<text>The Blackfoot language, also called Siksiká ( ; , ), is an Algonquian language spoken by the Blackfoot or people, who currently live in the northwestern plains of North America. There are four dialects, three of which are spoken in Alberta, Canada, and one of which is spoken in the United States: / (Blackfoot), to the southeast of Calgary, Alberta; / (Blood, Many Chiefs), spoken in Alberta between Cardston and Lethbridge; / (Northern Piegan), to the west of Fort MacLeod which is Brocket (Piikani) and / (Southern Piegan), in northwestern Montana. The name &quot;Blackfoot&quot; probably comes from the blackened soles of the leather shoes that the people wore.
There is a distinct difference between Old Blackfoot (also called High Blackfoot), the dialect spoken by many older speakers, and New Blackfoot (also called Modern Blackfoot), the dialect spoken by younger speakers. Among the Algonquian languages, Blackfoot is relatively divergent in phonology and lexicon. The language has a fairly small phoneme inventory, consisting of 11 basic consonants and three basic vowels that have contrastive length counterparts. Blackfoot is a pitch accent language. Blackfoot language has been declining in the number of native speakers and is classified as either a threatened or endangered language, depending on the source used.

Like the other Algonquian languages, Blackfoot is considered to be a polysynthetic language due to its large morpheme inventory and word internal complexity. A majority of Blackfoot morphemes have a one–to–one correspondence between form and meaning, a defining feature of agglutinative languages. However, Blackfoot does display some fusional characteristics as there are morphemes that are polysemous. Both noun and verb stems cannot be used bare but must be inflected. Due to its morphological complexity, Blackfoot has a flexible word order.

The Blackfoot language has experienced a substantial decrease in speakers since the 1960s and is classified as &quot;definitely endangered&quot; by the UNESCO Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger. In Canada, this loss has been attributed largely to residential schools, where Indigenous students were often punished severely for speaking their first languages. Widespread language loss can also be attributed to the Sixties Scoop, through which thousands of Indigenous children were taken from their families, often without parental consent, and relocated by the government into non-Indigenous families. As a result of these losses, the Blackfoot community has launched numerous language revitalization efforts, include the Piikani Traditional Knowledge Services and many more.

== Language variations ==
Pied Noir

&quot;Pied-Noir&quot; is an alternate name for the Blackfoot tribe. The exact translation is &#x27;black foot&#x27; in French.

 ( ᓱᘁᓱᘁᖳᐟᑲᖷᑊᓱᐡ) and (ᖹᐨᓱᑲᖷᑊᓱᐡ) are two other language variations for Blackfoot.

== Classification ==
Blackfoot is a member of the Algonquian language family belonging to the Plains areal grouping along with Arapaho, Gros Ventre, and Cheyenne. Blackfoot is spoken in Northwestern Montana and throughout Alberta, Canada, making it geographically one of the westernmost Algonquian languages.

== History ==
The Blackfoot people had been one of many Native American nations that inhabited the Great Plains west of the Mississippi River. The people were bison hunters, with settlements in what is now the northern United States and southern Canada. Forced to move because of wars with neighboring tribes, the Blackfoot people settled all around the plains area, eventually concentrating in what is now Montana and Alberta. Blackfoot hunters would track and hunt game, while the remaining people would gather food, and other necessities for the winter. The northern plains, where the Blackfoot settled, had incredibly harsh winters, and the flat land provided little escape from the winds. The Blackfoot Nation thrived, along with many other native groups, until the European settlers arrived in the late eighteenth century. The settlers brought with them horses and technology, but also disease and weapons. Diseases like smallpox, foreign to the natives, decimated the Blackfoot population in the mid-nineteenth century. Groups of Blackfoot people rebelled against the Europeans, such as Mountain Chief&#x27;s tribe. But in 1870, a tribe of peaceful Blackfoot were mistaken for the rebellious tribe and hundreds were slaughtered. Over the next thirty years, settlers had eradicated the bison from the Great Plains. This took away the main element of Blackfoot life and the people&#x27;s ability to be self-sustaining. With their main food source gone, the Blackfoot were forced to rely on government support.

In 1886, the Old Sun Residential School opened on the Siksika Reserve in Alberta. In 1908, it was described by an official survey as &quot;unsanitary&quot; and &quot;unsuitable in every way for such an institution&quot;. Regardless, it remained operational until its closure in 1971. Dozens of Blackfoot children died while attending. The school was rife with physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, which left a lasting impact on the Blackfoot children who attended. The trauma endured by students, as well as the subsequent repression of their Indigenous language and culture, has been credited, in part, with the loss in the number of Blackfoot speakers.

== Phonology ==

===Consonants===
Blackfoot has nineteen consonants, of which all but , , and form pairs distinguished by length. One of the two affricates is unusual for being heterorganic. Blackfoot has several allophones, is a allophone of .

===Vowels===

==== Monophthongs ====
Blackfoot has a vowel system with three monophthongs, .

The short monophthongs exhibit allophonic changes as well. The vowels and are raised to and respectively when followed by a long consonant. The vowel becomes in closed syllables.

==== Diphthongs ====
There are three additional diphthongs in Blackfoot. The first diphthong &quot;ai&quot; is pronounced before a long consonant, (or , in the dialect of the Blackfoot Reserve) before or , and elsewhere is pronounced in the Blood Reserve dialect or in the Blackfoot Reserve dialect. The second diphthong &quot;ao&quot; is pronounced before and elsewhere. The third diphthong &quot;oi&quot; may be pronounced before a long consonant and as elsewhere.

=== Length ===
Length is contrastive in Blackfoot for both vowels and consonants. Vowel length refers to the duration of a vowel and not a change in quality. The vowel is therefore the same sound as only differing in the length of time over which it is produced.
Consonants can also be lengthened with the exception of , , and .

=== Pitch accent ===
Blackfoot is a pitch accent language and it is a contrastive feature in the language. Every word will have at least one high pitched vowel or diphthong but may have more than one. Note that high pitch here is used relative to the contiguous syllables. Blackfoot utterances experience a gradual drop in pitch therefore if an utterance contains a set of accented vowels the first will be higher in pitch than the second but the second will be higher in pitch than the syllables directly surrounding it. Pitch is illustrated in the Latin-based orthography with an acute accent.

=== Phonological rules ===
Blackfoot is rich with morpho-phonological changes. Below is a limited sample of phonological rules.

==== Semi-vowel loss ====
Glides are deleted after another consonant, except a glottal stop, or word initially but kept in other conditions.

==== Accent spread ====
Accent will spread from an accented vowel to the following vowel across morpheme boundaries.

==== Vowel devoicing ====
At the end of a word, non-high pitched vowels are devoiced, regardless of length.

==Grammar – general==
===Lexical categories===

Lexical categories in Blackfoot are a matter of debate in the literature, with the exception of nouns and verbs. Additional proposed categories, proposed by Uhlenbeck, are adjectives, pronouns, adverbs, and particles. Taylor classifies the Blackfoot language as having two major classes, substantives (nouns and pronouns) and verbs, with one minor class consisting of particles. Frantz classifies adjectives and adverbs as affixes but not independent classes.

=== Agreement ===
Agreement morphology is extensive in Blackfoot and agreement morphemes are often fusional, i.e. animacy and number (nouns) or person and number (verbs) are indicated within the same affix.

====Animacy====
All nouns are required to be inflected for animacy and are classified as either animate or inanimate. Verbs are inflected to match the animacy of its arguments. Animacy in Blackfoot is a grammatical construct for noun classification. Therefore, some semantically inherently inanimate objects, such as drums and knives are grammatically animate.

Verbs are marked with a transitivity marker which must agree with the animacy of its arguments. Even in stories in which grammatically inanimate objects are markedly anthropomorphized, such as talking flowers, speakers will not use animate agreement markers with them.

==== Number ====
All nouns are required to be inflected as either singular or plural. Verbal inflection matches the number of its arguments.

==== Person marking ====
Blackfoot has five grammatical persons – first, second, third (proximate), fourth (obviative), and fifth (sub-obviative).

=== Word order ===
Word order is flexible in Blackfoot. Subjects are not required to precede the verb. Independent noun phrases may be included but these are typically dropped in Blackfoot. Due to the extensive person inflection on the verb they are not necessary for interpreting the meaning of the utterance. However, if first or second person pronouns are present it yields an emphatic reading. There is an ordering restriction if the Distinct Third Person (DTP) attached pronoun is used in which the subject independent noun phrase must occur before the verb. If the independent noun phrase occurs after the verb then the DTP may not be used.

=== Subjecthood ===
Blackfoot nouns must be grammatically particular in order to be a subject of a verb. In transitive constructions the subject must be volitional to be interpreted as subject.

=== Person hierarchy ===
It has been asserted that Blackfoot, along with other Algonquian languages, violates the Universal Person Hierarchy in verb complexes by ranking second person over first person. The hierarchy has traditionally been published as 2nd person &gt; 1st person &gt; 3rd person (proximate) &gt; 4th person (obviative). However, alternative analyses of Blackfoot person hierarchy have been published that suggest the Universal Person Hierarchy is applicable to Blackfoot.

===Verbal structure===
The Blackfoot verbal template contains a stem with several prefixes and suffixes. The structure of the verb stem in Blackfoot can be roughly broken down into the pre-verb, the root, the medial, and the final. The root and final are required elements.

Generally, information encoded in the pre-verb can include adverbs, most pronouns, locatives, manners, aspect, mood, and tense. Incorporated objects appear in the medial. The final includes transitivity and animacy markers, and valency markers.

== Grammar – nouns ==

=== Agreement morphology ===
Noun classes are split based on grammatical gender into two categories: animate and inanimate. Additionally, all nouns must be marked for number. Number agreement suffixes attach to noun stems and take four forms, as shown in the table below.


=== Proximate and obviative ===
When a sentence contains two or more particular animate gender nouns as arguments proximate (major third person/3rd) and obviative (minor third person/4th) markings are used to disambiguate. There may only be one proximate argument in any given sentence but multiple obviates are permissible. Proximate arguments are more prominent in discourse. Redirectional markers, referred to as inverse and direct theme in the literature, can be applied to indicate that the fourth person is the subject argument.

=== Particularity/referentiality ===
Blackfoot nouns must be grammatically particular, according to Frantz (2009), in order to be a subject of a verb. To be the subject of any verb in Blackfoot the noun must point to a specific referent in the world. In transitive constructions the subject must also be volitional to be interpreted as subject. If the subject of a transitive verb is non-specific or non-volitional then the verb must be inflected as having an unspecified subject.

== Grammar – verbs ==

=== Verbal morphology template ===
There are four verb categories in Blackfoot: intransitive inanimate, intransitive animate, transitive inanimate, and transitive animate. The parameters of transitivity and animacy for verb selection are typically referred to as stem agreement in order to delineate it from person agreement. The animacy for intransitive verbs is determined by the subject of the verb whereas the transitive verbs are defined by the animacy of their primary object.

The only required component of a clause in Blackfoot is the verb, referred to as a verbal complex in the Algonquian literature, that must be appropriately inflected according to the standard template: 

preverb – root – medial – final

Preverbs are prefixes which encode adverbs, most pronouns, locatives, manners, aspect, mood, and tense. Medials are suffixes which primarily encode manner and incorporated objects. Finals are suffixes which encode transitivity, animacy, and valency. Roots and finals are always required in a verbal complex whereas preverb and medials are not.

=== Inverse and direct theme ===
When there are two animate arguments acting in a transitive animate verb stem one of the arguments must be acting on the other. Which argument is the actor (subject) and which is the acted upon (object) is indicated by the use of direct or inverse theme marking. If a subject argument is higher than the object argument on the person hierarchy then the direct suffix is used. Conversely, when an object outranks the sentences subject then the inverse suffix is used.

; Direct
; Inverse
=== Voice and valency ===
Blackfoot voice alterations occur as suffixes on the verb and fall into the category of finals. Finals can include causative, benefactive, reciprocal, and reflexive affixes that either decrease or increase the valency of the stem they are attached to. Below is an example of the reflexive final suffix. It can only be added to a transitive animate stem and results in an animate intransitive stem. This is then interpreted as being a reflexive verb, where the subject of the AI (animate intransitive) stem is understood to be both the underlying subject and object of the original verb stem.

=== Relative clauses ===
Relative clauses are rare in Blackfoot but they do occur. In order to embed a clause, it needs to be nominalized first. The reclassification strategy for nominalization is displayed here followed by a relative clause that uses a nominal formed by this strategy. Reclassification is done by adding nominal inflection to the verb stem instead of person inflection. This derived form then refers to the underlying subject and agrees in both number and animacy.

Examples below show how a reclassified nominalized clause is used in a relative clause. Note the nominal agreement morphology on the verb matches the subject, singular and plural, respectively.

==Orthography==

===Latin-based orthography===

The Siksiká, Kainai, and Aapátohsipikani reserves adopted a standardized roman-based orthography in 1975. The Blackfoot alphabet consists of 13 letters: , and a glottal stop (ʼ).

Two digraphs are also used: ts and ks .

Vowels can be marked with an acute accent or underlined to illustrate pitch accent. Vowels and consonants that are long are written with a double letter (aa = ).

===Syllabic writing system===

A syllabics script, , was created by Anglican missionary John William Tims around 1888, for his Bible translation work. Although conceptually nearly identical to Western Cree syllabics, the letter forms are innovative. Two series (&quot;s&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) were taken from Cree but given different vowel values; three more (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;m&quot;) were changed in consonant values as well, according to the Latin letter they resembled; and the others (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) were created from asymmetrical parts of Latin and Greek letters; or in the case of the zero consonant, possibly from the musical notation for quarter note. The Latin orientation of the letters is used for the &quot;e&quot; series, after the names of the Latin letters, &quot;pe, te,&quot; etc.

The direction for each vowel is different from Cree, reflecting Latin alphabetic order. The &quot;e&quot; orientation is used for the diphthong . Symbols for consonants are taken from the consonant symbol minus the stem, except for diphthongs (&quot;Ca&quot; plus for &quot;Cau&quot;, and &quot;Ca&quot; plus for &quot;Coi&quot;, though there are also cases of writing subphonemic with these finals).

There are additional finals: allophones and , and three medials: , , , .

 is used for a period.

Also, sometimes it is written in Latin letters but with different spelling on computers because not all computers support the letters used in the Blackfoot language.

=== Literature===
John Tims was an Anglican clergyman with the Church Missionary Society. He was at Blackfoot reserve from 1883 to 1895. Tims translated parts of the Bible into Blackfoot. Selections from Matthew were published by the Church Missionary Society Mission Press in 1887. The Gospel of Matthew was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1890, and other portions of Scripture were published as Readings from the Holy Scriptures by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge in 1890. He used both Roman script and a Canadian Aboriginal syllabics script. The Gospel of Mark was translated by Donald G. Frantz and Patricia Frantz, and published by Scriptures Unlimited, a joint venture of the New York Bible Society (later called Biblica) and the World Home Bible League (later called the Bible League) in 1972. The Gospel of John was Translated by Wycliffe Bible Translators and Blackfoot people and published by the Canadian Bible Society in 1979.

== Causes of endangerment ==
Negative attitude towards Blackfoot is the primary reason for endangerment. Most children were discouraged from speaking the minority language in schools or public places. Children were often beaten for speaking their native language and were sent home. Teachers were very ashamed when their students spoke their native language.

== Vitality ==
According to the UNESCO Factor 1: Intergenerational Transmission, Blackfoot is classified under severely endangered. It is predicted that Blackfoot is used mostly by the grandparental generation and up. In fact, there are no more than 1500 native speakers, most of whom are likely over the age of 50. Due to the lack of speakers, the language will likely be extinct within the next 40 years. Once older people pass away, no one will be speaking Blackfoot unless something changes.

According to the UNESCO Factor 9: Amount and Quality of Documentation, there may be adequate grammar or sufficient amount of grammar, dictionaries, and texts. For example, a secondary documentation exists today, &quot;Blackfoot Dictionary of Stems, Roots and Affixes, 3rd Edition&quot; (2017), written by Donald G. Frantz and Norma Jean Russell. The newest edition includes more than 1,000 new entries, major additions to verb stems, contains more than 5,500 Blackfoot–English entries, and an English index of more than 6,000 entries. The transcription uses an official, technically accurate alphabet and the authors of this book have classified entries and selected examples based on more than 46 years of research. This book is comprehensive and includes enough information for those who wish to learn Blackfoot and for those who have an interest in Native Studies and North American linguistics.

== Revitalization efforts ==
In the late 1900s, many tribes began a surge of revitalization efforts to encourage cultural awareness of indigenous customs and traditions. Of these, the Blackfoot revitalization effort has proven to be quite successful, producing various institutions, including a college dedicated to preserving and promoting Blackfoot traditions. Today, there are head-start programs in primary and secondary schools on the reservation to teach even infants and toddlers about the history of the tribe from an early age.

=== The Piegan Institute ===
In 1987, Dorothy Still Smoking and Darrell Robes Kipp founded the Piegan Institute, a private 501(c)(3) non-profit foundation in Montana dedicated to researching, promoting, and preserving the Native American Languages, particularly the Blackfoot language. Piegan Institute founded Nizipuhwahsin (also Nizi Puh Wah Sin or Niitsípuwahsin or Cuts Wood) School in 1995 as a Blackfoot language K–8 immersion school. Since its inception the school has grown and relocated to the center of Browning, Montana, in a custom-built schoolhouse. Recently, some of the school&#x27;s first graduates have returned to teach the newest generation the Blackfoot language.

=== Blackfeet Community College ===
Blackfeet Community College (BCC), founded in 1974, is a two-year, nationally accredited college that was made possible by the Indian Education Act of 1972 and the 1964 Act enacted by the Office of Economic Opportunity. BCC is a member of both the American Indian Higher Education Consortium and the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES). It allows teenagers and adults alike to take classes in a wide range of subjects, from classes in Psychology and Digital Photography to classes on Blackfoot language and tradition. They have beginning Blackfoot language classes with labs for members and non-members of the community to learn the language.

=== Chief Mountain Technologies ===
In order to create jobs for the Blackfoot people with real-world applications, the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council launched a company called Chief Mountain Technologies in 2009. This company gives tribal members the opportunity to work in the fields of computer science and business in Browning, Montana, on behalf of various government organizations. The establishment of this company in the Blackfoot community allows the people to use their culture and their language in the modern world while maintaining their traditions.

===Radio programming in Blackfoot===
Radio station KBWG in Browning, Montana, broadcasts a one-hour show for Blackfoot language learners four times a week. The Voice of Browning, Thunder Radio, FM 107.5, or (literally &#x27;voice from nowhere&#x27;) went live in 2010, and focuses on positive programming. In 2011, John Davis, a 21-year-old Blackfeet Community College student explained, &quot;I was the first Blackfeet to ever talk on this radio&quot;, Davis said. &quot;This is my coup story.&quot; A story in the &quot;Great Falls Tribune&quot; noted, &quot;When the station was replaying programming that originated elsewhere, the radio was all &#x27;tear in my beer&#x27; and &#x27;your cheatin&#x27; heart.&#x27; They called it the suicide station for its depressing old country themes...&quot; The station&#x27;s offerings have now expanded beyond country to include AC/DC and Marvin Gaye, and &quot;on-the-air jokes they would never hear on a Clear Channel radio station, such as: &#x27;The captain is as cool as commodity cheese.

&quot;So far we have broadcasting Monday through Friday from around 6:30, Indian time&quot;, quipped station manager Lona Burns, &quot;to around 11, Indian time.&quot; ... &quot;It&#x27;s Indian radio&quot;, agreed Running Crane. &quot;Where else can you hear today&#x27;s hits with traditional music?&quot;

===Canadian government support===
The Canadian government has provided support for the languages through funds and other financial resources. According to James Moore, the former Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages, &quot;the Government of Canada is committed to the revitalization and preservation of Aboriginal languages.&quot; The funding was put to use in the form of digital libraries containing interviews with native speakers, online courses, and various other resources in the hopes of promoting Blackfoot language and passing it down to subsequent generations. On top of both of these government efforts, the Canadian Government has also provided over $40,000 through the Aboriginal Languages Initiative Fund to promote the use of Aboriginal languages in community and family settings.

In 2019 the Canadian government announced their investment of over $1.5 million towards supporting Indigenous languages in Southern Alberta. Eleven out of seventeen projects approved for funding focus on revitalization of the Blackfoot language and include efforts such as language classes, illustrated workbooks, graphic novels, a video game, and a mobile app.

In addition to federal funding, the Blackfoot language is also supported through Alberta&#x27;s Indigenous Languages in Education grant program. This program offers up to $285,000 annually towards the development of Indigenous language training, programs, and curricula for instructors between Kindergarten and Grade 12, and an additional $50,000 annually towards development of new resources for Indigenous language teaching and learning.

=== Piikani Traditional Knowledge Services ===
Piikani Traditional Knowledge Services serve the Piikani Nation as the first stop in understanding the development of meaningful relationships with the Indigenous Nation. Their vision is to enhance, preserve, protect, and be keepers of the Piikani culture, language, spirituality, songs, customs, and history. This program is committed to sustaining and preserving , the way of life of the Piikani, that identifies characteristic values, principles, and integrity maintained from ancient Piikani culture and practices. The program includes Piikanissi cultural education and training, Piikanissini cultural mobilization, Piikanissini data management, and provides resources that promote . This program is community-based and focuses on keeping the Blackfoot culture and language alive.

<text>Hawaiian pizza is a pizza originating in Canada, traditionally topped with pineapple, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and either ham or bacon.

==History==
Sam Panopoulos, a Greek-born Canadian, created the first Hawaiian pizza at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham-Kent, Ontario, Canada, in 1962. Inspired in part by his experience preparing Chinese dishes which commonly mix sweet and sour flavours, Panopoulos experimented with adding pineapple, ham, bacon, and other toppings. These additions were not initially very popular.

The addition of pineapple to the traditional mix of tomato sauce and cheese, along with either ham or bacon, later became popular locally and eventually became a staple offering of pizzerias on a global scale. The name of this creation was not directly inspired by the U.S. state of Hawaii at all; Panopoulos chose the name &quot;Hawaiian&quot; after the brand of canned pineapple they were using at the time.

In Germany, Hawaiian pizza is thought to be a variation of the ham, pineapple and cheese-topped Toast Hawaii, originally introduced by Germany&#x27;s first TV cook Clemens Wilmenrod in 1955. In 1957, a &quot;Hawaiian Pizza&quot; containing pineapple, papaya, and chopped green pepper, but not ham or bacon, appeared in Portland, Oregon.

A blend of cheeses, usually consisting of mozzarella cheese, is a popular topping on Hawaiian pizza. In the United States, some restaurants use barbecue sauce and pulled pork with pineapple and cheese as an alternative to the more traditional combination featuring tomato sauce and either ham or bacon.

==In popular media==
In 2014, &quot;Time&quot; listed Hawaiian pizza first on its list of &quot;The 13 Most Influential Pizzas of All Time&quot;. Opinions towards Hawaiian pizza are generally divisive and polarizing. Although many enjoy the taste, others vehemently dislike it, possibly due to the sweetness of pineapple paired with &quot;salty pizza ingredients&quot;.

In 2017, Icelandic president Guðni Th. Jóhannesson reportedly told a group of high school students during a Q&amp;A that he was fundamentally opposed to putting pineapple on pizza. He jokingly added that he would ban pineapple as a pizza topping if he could, as long as he received 30% of the under 21 vote. His off-the-cuff remark generated a flurry of media coverage and inspired many, regardless of their taste for Hawaiian pizza, to express their opinions on social media. Celebrities shared their liking or distaste for Hawaiian pizza, including Canada&#x27;s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who expressed support for it by tweeting: &quot;I have a pineapple. I have a pizza. And I stand behind this delicious Southwestern Ontario creation.&quot; Panopoulos, at that point retired from the restaurant business, was called upon by some media outlets to defend his creation.

Guðni later clarified that he was only joking, and that he did not have the power to ban particular toppings on pizza; he added that even he would not like to live in a country where the leader could ban anything that they did not like.

American author John Green reflected on the dish&#x27;s cosmopolitan origins and reach, noting its Canadian invention by a Greek immigrant, inspired by Chinese cuisine to put a South American fruit on an Italian dish, which has gained its greatest popularity in Australia.

==Surveys==
Hawaiian was the most popular pizza in Australia in 1999, accounting for 15% of pizza sales.

A 2015 review of independent UK takeaways operating through Just Eat found the Hawaiian pizza to be the most commonly available. A 2016 The Harris Poll survey of US adults had pineapple in the top three least-favorite pizza toppings, ahead of anchovies and mushrooms.

According to a 2019 YouGov Omnibus survey, 12% of Americans who eat pizza say that pineapple is one of their top three favorite pizza toppings, and 24% say that pineapple is one of their least favorite toppings. It was not the most disliked topping, however, as other ingredients were even more widely unpopular in the survey: anchovies and eggplant.

<text>Armin Mueller-Stahl (born 17 December 1930) is a retired German actor who also appeared in numerous English-language films since the 1980s. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in &quot;Shine&quot;. In 2011, he was awarded the Honorary Golden Bear.

==Early life==

Mueller-Stahl was born in Tilsit, East Prussia (now Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). His mother, Editta, was from an upper-class family and became a university professor in Leipzig. His father, Alfred Müller, was a bank teller who changed the family&#x27;s surname to &quot;Mueller-Stahl&quot;. The rest of the family moved to Berlin while his father fought on the Eastern Front in World War II. Mueller-Stahl was a concert violinist while he was a teenager and enrolled at an East Berlin acting school in 1952.

==Career==
Mueller-Stahl was a film and stage actor in East Germany, performing in such films as &quot;Her Third&quot; and &quot;Jacob the Liar&quot;. For that country&#x27;s television, he played the main character of the popular series &quot;Das unsichtbare Visier&quot; from 1973 to 1979, a spy thriller program designed, in co-operation with the Stasi, as a counterpart to the James Bond films. After protesting against Wolf Biermann&#x27;s denaturalization in 1976 he was blacklisted by the government. Immigrating in 1980 to West Germany, he found regular work in films. These included Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s &quot;Lola&quot; (1981) and &quot;Veronika Voss&quot; (1982), Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s &quot;A Love in Germany&quot; (1984), &quot;Angry Harvest&quot; and the Academy Award nominated Hungarian-West German film &quot;Colonel Redl&quot; (both 1985), the latter about the scandal surrounding Austro-Hungarian Army Colonel Alfred Redl.

Mueller-Stahl played the Soviet general in charge of the occupied United States in the 1987 ABC television miniseries &quot;Amerika&quot;. He made his American feature film debut as Jessica Lange&#x27;s character&#x27;s father in &quot;Music Box&quot; (1989). His performance as a Jewish immigrant to the United States in the 1990 film &quot;Avalon&quot; was widely praised. He subsequently took character roles in &quot;Kafka&quot; by Steven Soderbergh and &quot;Night on Earth&quot; by Jim Jarmusch (both 1991). 

Mueller-Stahl won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival for his performance in &quot;Utz&quot; (1992). Mueller-Stahl was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the abusive father of pianist David Helfgott in the 1996 film &quot;Shine&quot;. Mueller-Stahl was also in &quot;A Pyromaniac&#x27;s Love Story&quot; (1995) and the 1997 remake of the film &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;. &quot;Conversation with the Beast&quot; (1996) was his first film as director. In 1998, he played the German scientist and syndicate member, Conrad Strughold, in the feature film &quot;The X-Files&quot;. In 1999 he played the mastermind of a criminal gang opposite Ray Liotta and Gloria Reuben in &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, also distributed under the title &quot;Inferno&quot;.

In the early 2000s, Mueller-Stahl received a positive response for his portrayal of Thomas Mann in a German miniseries about the Mann family called &quot;Die Manns - Ein Jahrhundertroman&quot;. In 2004, Mueller-Stahl made a foray into American television, guest-starring in four episodes on the television drama series &quot;The West Wing&quot; as the Prime Minister of Israel. In 2006, he played the role of reclusive Russian artist Nikolai Seroff in &quot;Local Color&quot;. He had a villainous role in David Cronenberg&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Eastern Promises&quot; (2007) and the thriller &quot;The International&quot; (2009), both of which co-starred British-Australian actress Naomi Watts. In 2008, he won the Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role for &quot;Eastern Promises&quot;. Mueller-Stahl played the role of Cardinal Strauss, Dean of the College of Cardinals and the Papal conclave, in &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; (2009).

In 2011, he was awarded the Honorary Golden Bear at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival.

Since the creation of the Freya von Moltke Stiftung, working out of Berlin and Krzyżowa, he has been a supporter and linked with their work.

<text>In sha&#x27; Allah, usually called the &quot;Istit̲h̲nāʾ&quot;, is an Arabic-language expression meaning or . It is mentioned in the Quran, which requires its use when mentioning future events. It signifies that nothing, neither action nor thought, happens without God&#x27;s permission.

In an Islamic context, it expresses the belief that nothing happens unless God wills it, and that his will supersedes all human will; however, more generally the phrase is commonly used by Muslims, Arab Christians and Arabic speakers of other religions to refer to events that one hopes will happen in the future, having the same meaning as the English word &quot;hopefully&quot;.

The phrase can take on an ironic context when one dismisses their free will entirely and claims the matter is in God&#x27;s hands. For example, when one receives an invitation they have no intention of accepting, they might say &quot;inshallah&quot; as an open-ended response.

<text>Concrete is a comic book series created and written by Paul Chadwick and published by Dark Horse Comics.

The character&#x27;s first appearance is &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; #1 (July 1986). The eponymous central character is a normal man whose brain was transplanted into a large, stone body by aliens, and who lives an extraordinary life on Earth following his escape.

The &quot;Concrete&quot; series focuses on realism. Apart from the aliens (which appear only in original series issue #3, in Concrete&#x27;s recounting of his origin) and Concrete&#x27;s own high-tech, artificial, stone body (which includes a host of attendant abilities), there are no supernatural or science fiction elements to any stories.

The hero tries to use his body for noble endeavors, such as helping out on a family farm. Later, Concrete climbs Mount Everest, becomes involved with a group of hardline environmental militants, and reluctantly agrees to become the spokesperson of a campaign to voluntarily reduce the Earth&#x27;s population.

Concrete&#x27;s sexuality is addressed in the series. An artist at heart, he collects paintings of female nudes. He is embarrassed at his lack of sexual organs; this is often the subject of hurtful jokes thrown his way.

Real-world physics apply to Concrete. Examples include Concrete breaking objects by sitting on them, or Concrete being shot forward from a braking car, due to the momentum of his large body. He is constantly breaking telephones and doorknobs, and must hire an assistant, Larry Munro, because his hands are too clumsy to handle a pen.

The series makes frequent use of thought balloons, showing characters&#x27; interior thoughts and feelings.
In addition to the comic, Paul Chadwick has drawn Concrete in many paintings. Most show the character wandering in nature, perhaps looking at a flower or some other natural curiosity.

==Character history==
The series focuses on the life of Concrete, formerly Ron Lithgow, whose brain was involuntarily transplanted by aliens into a hulking artificial body which is made up of a substance that closely resembles concrete. As part of the back-story, he eventually escaped and made contact with the US Senator he worked for as a speechwriter. After a prolonged period of scientific tests and examinations, he was allowed to live on his own with the cover story that he was a cyborg constructed by the government.

In his new body, Concrete decides to use his tremendous strength, endurance and vision for a series of adventures he never thought of in his previous sedate life. Hiring a personal assistant writer and accompanied by a scientist who is assigned to monitor his body, Concrete has a wide variety of adventures.

==Awards and recognition==
The series won the Eisner Awards for Best Continuing Series for 1988 and 1989, Best Black-and-White Series for 1988 and 1989, and Best New Series for 1988, and their Best Writer/Artist Award for Paul Chadwick for 1989. It received the Harvey Award for Best New Series in 1988, and won Chadwick their Award For Cartoonist (Writer/Artist) for 1989.

* &quot;Concrete: Eclectica&quot; #2, color comic, has color versions of &quot;I Strive for Realism&quot;, &quot;Soon, we&#x27;ll all float in A Sky of Heads&quot;, &quot;100 Horrors&quot; #4, and a five-page art portfolio.
* &quot;Concrete Hero Special&quot;, April 1995, reprinted &quot;Moving a Big Rock&quot; with 2 alternate pages not published elsewhere. This was an eight-page story produced to promote the then upcoming &quot;Think Like a Mountain&quot; mini-series. Six pages of this story are actually straight from &quot;Think Like a Mountain&quot; #4, and appear both in the original issue and the collected editions. However, the first and last page of the story were redone for the Hero Special so the story would make sense in the context of eight pages. Much of the dialogue is the same as what appears in the original comics and collected editions, so there really isn&#x27;t much difference between the two alternate pages that appear in the &quot;Hero Special&quot; and what appears in &quot;Think Like a Mountain&quot; #4 and the subsequent collected editions.

==In other media==
A film based on the character was in pre-production during the early 1990s, with a script written by Larry Wilson and Paul Chadwick. The film was cancelled.

<text>The Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is an anonymous network layer (implemented as a mix network) that allows for censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer communication. Anonymous connections are achieved by encrypting the user&#x27;s traffic (by using end-to-end encryption), and sending it through a volunteer-run network of roughly 55,000 computers distributed around the world. Given the high number of possible paths the traffic can transit, a third party watching a full connection is unlikely. The software that implements this layer is called an &quot;I2P router&quot;, and a computer running I2P is called an &quot;I2P node&quot;. I2P is free and open source, and is published under multiple licenses.

== Technical design ==
I2P started in 2003 as a fork of Freenet.

The network is strictly message-based, like IP, but a library is available to allow reliable streaming communication on top of it (similar to Non-blocking IO-based TCP, although from version 0.6, a new &quot;Secure Semi-reliable&quot; UDP transport is used). All communication is end-to-end encrypted (in total, four layers of encryption are used when sending a message) through garlic routing, and even the end points (&quot;destinations&quot;) are cryptographic identifiers (essentially a pair of public keys), so that neither senders nor recipients of messages need to reveal their IP address to the other side or to third-party observers.

Although many developers had been a part of the Invisible IRC Project (IIP) and Freenet communities, significant differences exist between their designs and concepts. IIP was an anonymous centralized IRC server. Freenet is a censorship-resistant distributed data store. I2P is an anonymous peer-to-peer distributed communication layer designed to run &quot;any&quot; traditional internet service (e.g. Usenet, email, IRC, file sharing, Web hosting and HTTP, or Telnet), as well as more traditional distributed applications (e.g. a distributed data store, a web proxy network using Squid, or DNS).

Many developers of I2P are known only under pseudonyms. While the previous main developer, &quot;jrandom&quot;, is currently on hiatus, others, such as &quot;zzz&quot;, &quot;killyourtv&quot;, and &quot;Complication&quot; have continued to lead development efforts, and are assisted by numerous contributors.

I2P uses 2048bit ElGamal/AES256/SHA256+Session Tags encryption and Ed25519 EdDSA/ECDSA signatures.

=== Releases ===
I2P has had a stable release every six to eight weeks. Updates are distributed via I2P torrents and are signed by the release manager (generally &quot;zzz&quot; or &quot;str4d&quot;).
== Funding ==
The website states that &quot;funding for I2P comes entirely from donations&quot;. Admins and managers of the project said that &quot;the core project itself doesn&#x27;t take donations&quot;. These should instead go to secondary applications or be spent on hiring others, to work on I2P. Support for the onboarding for I2P came from the &quot;Open Technology Fund&quot;. In contrast to &quot;The Tor Project&quot;, I2P has &quot;not the financial or legal infrastructure to support a network of exit nodes&quot;. The reseed servers, a sort of bootstrap nodes, which connect the user with the initial set of peers to join the I2P-network, should be run by volunteers.

== Software ==
Since I2P is an anonymizing network layer, it is designed so other software can use it for anonymous communication. As such, there are a variety of tools currently available for I2P or in development.

The I2P router is controlled through the router console, which is a web frontend accessed through a web browser.

=== General networking ===
* &quot;I2PTunnel&quot; is an application embedded into I2P that allows arbitrary TCP/IP applications to communicate over I2P by setting up &quot;tunnels&quot; which can be accessed by connecting to pre-determined ports on localhost.
* &quot;SAM&quot; (&quot;Simple Anonymous Messaging&quot;) is a protocol which allows a client application written in any programming language to communicate over I2P, by using a socket-based interface to the I2P router.
* &quot;BOB&quot; (&quot;Basic Open Bridge&quot;) is a less complex app to router protocol similar to &quot;SAM&quot;
* &quot;Orchid&quot; Outproxy Tor plugin
* As of version 2.6.0, released in July 2024, I2P no longer allows I2P access over Tor connections.

=== Chat ===
* Any IRC client made for the Internet Relay Chat can work, once connected to the I2P IRC server (on localhost). I2P have the option to create tunnels that are specific for this usage, where certain commands that could de-anonymize the user are filtered out.
* Some XMPP clients like Gajim, Pidgin or a modified Conversations client can work with I2P XMPP servers using Prosody that are using the mod_darknet module

=== File sharing ===
* Several programs provide BitTorrent functionality for use within the I2P network. Users cannot connect to non-I2P torrents or peers from within I2P, nor can they connect to I2P torrents or peers from outside I2P. &quot;I2PSnark&quot;, included in the I2P install package, is a port of the BitTorrent client named Snark. &quot;Vuze&quot;, formerly known as Azureus, is a BitTorrent client that includes a plugin for I2P, allowing anonymous swarming through this network. This plugin is still in an early stage of development, however it is already fairly stable. &quot;I2P-BT&quot; is a BitTorrent client for I2P that allows anonymous swarming for file sharing. This client is a modified version of the original BitTorrent 3.4.2 program which runs on MS Windows and most dialects of Unix in a GUI and command-line environment. It was developed by the individual known as &#x27;duck&#x27; on I2P in cooperation with &#x27;smeghead&#x27;. It is no longer being actively developed; however, there is a small effort to upgrade the I2P-BT client up to par with the BitTorrent 4.0 release. &quot;I2PRufus&quot; is an I2P port of the Rufus BitTorrent client. Robert (P2P Software) is the most actively maintained I2PRufus fork. XD is a standalone BitTorrent client written in Go. BiglyBT is a bittorrent client based on Vuze which also allows the use of i2p for downloading/seeding. Additionally, there exists a torrent index named &quot;Postman&quot;, ran by the individual with the same name, its rules says that it does not allow illegal content, but warez and piracy is accepted.
* Two Kad network clients exist for the I2P network, &quot;iMule&quot; and &quot;Nachtblitz&quot;. iMule (&quot;invisible Mule&quot;) is a port of eMule for I2P network. iMule has not been developed since 2013. iMule is made for anonymous file sharing. In contrast to other eDonkey clients, iMule only uses the Kademlia for proceeding to connect through I2P network, so no servers are needed. &quot;Nachtblitz&quot; is a custom client built on the .NET Framework. The latest version is 1.4.27, released on March 23, 2016. Nachtblitz includes a time lock to disable the software one year after its release date. 
* I2Phex is a port of the popular Gnutella client Phex to I2P. It is stable and fairly functional.
* Tahoe-LAFS has been ported to I2P. This allows for files to be anonymously stored in Tahoe-LAFS grids.
*MuWire is a file-sharing program inspired by the LimeWire Gnutella client that works atop the I2P network.

==== Bridging to clearnet ====
Currently, Vuze and BiglyBT are the torrent clients that make clearnet (connections not through I2P) torrents available on I2P and vice versa. Depending on the client settings, torrents from the internet can be made available on I2P (via announcements to I2P&#x27;s DHT network) and torrents from I2P can be made available to the internet. For this reason, torrents previously published only on I2P can be made available to the entire Internet, and users of I2P can often download popular content from the Internet while maintaining the anonymity of I2P. As of August 2022, the default outproxy is exit.stormycloud.i2p which is run by StormyCloud Inc.

=== Email ===

* &quot;I2P-Bote&quot; is a free, fully decentralized and distributed anonymous email system with a strong focus on security. It supports multiple identities and does not expose email metadata. , it is still considered beta software. I2P-Bote is accessible via the I2P web console interface or using standard email protocols (i.e. IMAP/SMTP). All bote-mails are transparently end-to-end encrypted and signed by the sender&#x27;s private key, thus removing the need for PGP or other email encryption software. I2P-Bote offers additional anonymity by allowing for the use of mail relays with variable length delays. Since it is decentralized, there is no centralized email server that could correlate different email identities as communicating with each other (i.e. &quot;profiling&quot;). Even the nodes relaying the mails do not know the sender, and apart from sender and receiver, only the end of the high-latency mail route and the storing nodes will know to whom (which I2P-Bote address – the user&#x27;s IP address is still hidden by I2P) the mail is destined. The original sender could have gone offline long before the email becomes available to the recipient. No account registration is necessary, all you have to do in order to use it is create a new identity. I2P-Bote can be installed as an I2P plugin .
* I2P also has a free pseudonymous e-mail service run by an individual called &quot;Postman&quot;. Susimail is a web-based email client intended primarily for use with Postman&#x27;s mail servers, and is designed with security and anonymity in mind. Susimail was created to address privacy concerns in using these servers directly using traditional email clients, such as leaking the user&#x27;s hostname while communicating with the SMTP server. It is currently included in the default I2P distribution, and can be accessed through the I2P router console web interface. Mail.i2p can contact both I2P email users and public internet email users.
* Bitmessage.ch can be used over I2P

=== Instant messaging ===
* &quot;I2P-Messenger&quot; is a simple Qt-based, serverless, end-to-end-encrypted instant messenger for I2P. No servers can log the user&#x27;s conversations. No ISP can log with whom the user chats, when, or for how long. As it is serverless, it can make use of I2P&#x27;s end-to-end encryption, preventing any node between two parties from having access to the plain text. I2P-Messenger can be used for fully anonymous instant communication with persons the user doesn&#x27;t even know, or, alternatively, to communicate securely and untraceably with friends, family members, or colleagues. In addition to messaging, file transfer is also supported.

* &quot;I2P-Talk&quot; is another simple instant messenger incompatible with I2P-Messenger, but having the same security properties

=== Publishing ===
* &quot;Syndie&quot; is a content distribution application, suitable for blogs, newsgroups, forums and small media attachments. Syndie is designed for network resilience. It supports connections to I2P, the Tor network (Syndie does not support Socks proxies, workaround needed for Tor access), Freenet and the regular internet. Server connections are intermittent, and support higher-latency communications. Connections can be made to any number of known servers. Content is spread efficiently using a Gossip protocol. 
* &quot;Aktie&quot; is an anonymous file sharing and distributed web of trust forums system. Aktie can connect to I2P with its internal router or use an external router. To fight spam, &quot;hash payments&quot; (proof of CPU work) is computed for every published item.

=== Routers ===
*i2pd is a light-weight I2P router written in C++, stripping the excessive applications such as e-mail, torrents, and others that can be regarded as bloat. The I2PSnark standalone BitTorrent client by I2P+ Team can still be used with it.

=== The Privacy Solutions project ===
The Privacy Solutions project, a new organization that develops and maintains I2P software, launched several new development efforts designed to enhance the privacy, security, and anonymity for users, based on I2P protocols and technology.

These efforts include:

* The Abscond browser bundle.
* i2pd, an alternate implementation of I2P, written in C++ (rather than Java).
* The &quot;BigBrother&quot; I2P network monitoring project.

The code repository and download sections for the i2pd and Abscond project is available for the public to review and download.
Effective January, 2015 i2pd is operating under PurpleI2P.

===Android===
* Release builds of an I2P Router application for Android can be found on the Google Play store under The Privacy Solutions Project&#x27;s Google Play account or on an F-Droid repository hosted by the developers.
* &quot;Nightweb&quot; is an Android application that utilizes I2P and Bittorrent to share blog posts, photos, and other similar content. It can also be run as a desktop application. It is no longer in development.

===Cryptocurrency===
Some cryptocurrencies that support I2P are listed below.

* Bitcoin
* Monero
* Verge

== Terminology ==
; Eepsite: Eepsites are websites that are hosted anonymously within the I2P network. Eepsite names end in &quot;.i2p&quot;, such as &quot;ugha.i2p&quot; or &quot;forum.i2p&quot;. EepProxy can locate these sites through the cryptographic identifier keys stored in the hosts.txt file found within the I2P program directory. Typically, I2P is required to access these eepsites.
; .i2p: &#x27;I2p&#x27; is a pseudo-top-level domain which is only valid within the I2P overlay network scope. codice_1 names are resolved by browsers by submitting requests to EepProxy which will resolve names to an I2P peer key and will handle data transfers over the I2P network while remaining transparent to the browser.
; EepProxy: The EepProxy program handles all communication between the browser and any eepsite. It functions as a proxy server that can be used by any web browser.
; Peers, I2P nodes: Other machines using I2P that are connected to user&#x27;s machine within the network. Each machine within the network shares the routing and forwarding of encrypted packets.
; Tunnels: Every ten minutes, a connection is established between the user&#x27;s machine and another peer. Data to and from the user, along with the data for other peers (routed through the user&#x27;s machine), pass through these tunnels and are forwarded to their final destination (may include more jumps).
; netDb: The distributed hash table (DHT) database based on the Kademlia algorithm that holds information on I2P nodes and I2P eepsites. This database is split up among routers known as &quot;floodfill routers&quot;. When a user wants to know how to contact an eepsite, or where more peers are, they query the database.

==Vulnerabilities==
Denial of service attacks are possible against websites hosted on the network, though a site operator may secure their site against certain versions of this type of attack to some extent.

A zero-day vulnerability was discovered for I2P in 2014, and was exploited to de-anonymize at least 30,000 users. This included users of the operating system Tails. This vulnerability was later patched.

A 2017 study examining how forensic investigators might exploit vulnerabilities in I2P software to gather useful evidence indicated that a seized machine which had been running I2P router software may hold unencrypted local data that could be useful to law enforcement. Records of which websites a user of a later-seized machine was interested in may also be inferred. The study identified a &quot;trusted&quot; I2P domain registrar (&quot;NO.i2p&quot;) which appeared to have been abandoned by its administrator, and which the study identified as a potential target for law enforcement takeover. It alternatively suggested waiting for NO.i2p&#x27;s server to fail, only to social engineer the I2P community into moving to a phony replacement. Another suggestion the study proposed was to register a mirror version of a target website under an identical domain.

== I2PCon ==

From an I2P convention was held in Toronto, Ontario. The conference was hosted by a local hackerspace, Hacklab. The conference featured presentations from I2P developers and security researchers.

<doc id="538445" wikidata="Q880116" url="?curid=538445" title="Black Box (band)">
<text>Black Box is an Italian house music group popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The group is currently made up of DJ Daniele Davoli, classically trained clarinet teacher Valerio Semplici, keyboardist and electronic musician Mirko Limoni, and vocalist Celestine Walcott-Gordon. French fashion model Katrin Quinol joined the act in 1989 and became the official face of Black Box, appearing on the cover of their single and album releases as well as in music videos, including the hit &quot;Ride on Time&quot;, which was the highest-selling single of 1989 in the UK. The following year, it was revealed that Quinol was lip-syncing and had not performed on the recording. American singer Martha Wash performed the majority of the songs on the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Dreamland&quot;, while being uncredited.

==History==
===1988–1989: Early beginnings===
Daniele Davoli, Valerio Semplici, and Mirko Limoni formed a production team called Starlight (often credited as Starlight Invention Group). The group&#x27;s first single was a dance single called &quot;Numero Uno&quot;, released in 1988. The song was often credited by their other alias, Groove Groove Melody. &quot;Numero Uno&quot; peaked at number nine on the UK Singles chart. In early 1989, they produced a single called &quot;Vocalizado&quot; for Italian singer Robby Magno. In mid-1989, the group released the maxi-single &quot;Airport 89&quot; under the name Wood Allen. The single peaked at number 99 on the UK Singles chart.

===1989–1992: &quot;Dreamland&quot;===

In 1989, the group changed their name to Black Box and began working on their first album. They added French Caribbean model Katrin Quinol to the lineup as the group&#x27;s &quot;frontwoman&quot;. Quinol&#x27;s contribution was to lip sync songs in music videos and during televised performances. In July 1989, Black Box released their single &quot;Ride on Time&quot;. The song became an international hit, peaking at number one in three countries, including the UK, where it became the UK&#x27;s best-selling single of 1989, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide. In November 1989, they released the single &quot;Grand Piano&quot; under the alias Mixmaster. The song peaked at number nine on the UK Singles chart. In December 1989, they released the follow-up single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anybody Else&quot;. The song became an international top-ten hit and gave the group their first number-one song on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Dance chart. In March 1990, they released their fourth single, &quot;Everybody Everybody&quot;. Like its predecessors, the song also became an international hit and earned the group their second number one on the Dance chart.

In May 1990, they released their debut album &quot;Dreamland&quot;. Despite its moderate performance on the charts, the album became certified gold in the United Kingdom and United States and peaked at number one in the Australian chart.
In late 1990, the album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, a cover of the 1978 hit by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, peaked at number five on the UK Singles chart and became certified silver in the United Kingdom.

In February 1991, &quot;Strike It Up&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fifth single. The song became another international top-ten hit for the group and earned them their third number-one single on the Dance chart. The album&#x27;s final singles &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Hold On&quot; performed moderately well on the charts. In the same year, Black Box released a re-issue of &quot;Ride on Time&quot; called &quot;Bright on Time&quot;. Quinol, who did not contribute vocally or musically to the group&#x27;s music, left Black Box in late 1991 after the band became the subject of a media backlash involving lip-syncing scandals and lawsuits.

===1993–1999: &quot;Positive Vibration &quot; and lineup changes===
In 1993, Black Box added American singer Charvoni Woodson to the lineup. They released the single &quot;Rockin&#x27; to the Music&quot;, which performed poorly on the charts. In 1995, Black Box released their second album, &quot;Positive Vibration&quot;, which failed to chart or rise to the same level of success as their previous record. The album spawned the singles &quot;Not Anyone&quot; and &quot;A Positive Vibration&quot;, both of which fared well on the charts. In 1997, the album was re-issued with three additional singles: &quot;I Got the Vibration&quot;, &quot;Native New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;Fall into My Love&quot;.

In April 1998, Black Box released a compilation album, &quot;Strike It Up: The Best of Black Box&quot;. In June 1998, they released another compilation, &quot;Hits &amp; Mixes&quot;. In 1999, a maxi single of remixes for &quot;Bright on Time&quot; was exclusively released in France.

===2003–present===
Woodson continued touring and performing as the lead vocalist of the group periodically until 2015. That year, Celestine Walcott-Gordon began performing live as the new lead vocalist. In 2018, the group released the single &quot;Everyone Will Follow&quot;, featuring vocals by Walcott-Gordon.

==Lip-syncing scandals and lawsuits==
In 1990, American singer Loleatta Holloway and American producer Dan Hartman sued Black Box for copyright infringement and unauthorized sampling. &quot;Ride on Time&quot; sampled Holloway&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Love Sensation&quot;, which was written and produced by Hartman. Neither Holloway nor Hartman were consulted for permission to sample the song, and Black Box failed to credit Holloway&#x27;s vocals in the song. Additionally, Black Box had used Quinol to lip-sync Holloway&#x27;s vocals in the music video for &quot;Ride on Time&quot;, which led the public to believe Quinol was the actual singer. Holloway and Hartman eventually received an undisclosed out-of-court settlement. As a result, Black Box re-issued &quot;Ride on Time&quot;, removing Holloway&#x27;s vocals and featuring newly recorded vocals by English singer Heather Small. The group still retained the original version on their re-issued album &quot;Dreamland&quot; and added Holloway&#x27;s name as the featured vocalist on &quot;Ride on Time&quot; as well as giving Hartman songwriting credits. Black Box would later issue another new version of the song called &quot;Bright on Time&quot; in 1991.

In September 1990, American singer Martha Wash sued Black Box and RCA Records for commercial appropriation after she became aware of the lip-sync scandal perpetrated by the group. During the recording session of their album &quot;Dreamland&quot; in 1989, Wash was recruited as a session singer to simply demo songs produced by Black Box. Unbeknownst to her, Black Box retained Wash&#x27;s vocals on a total of six songs, including &quot;Everybody Everybody&quot;, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Anybody Else&quot;, &quot;Strike It Up&quot;, and &quot;Fantasy&quot; on the album &quot;Dreamland&quot;. Despite Wash&#x27;s contributions to the songs, Black Box never credited her for her vocals and instead used Quinol to lip-sync Wash&#x27;s vocals during music videos, televised performances, and concert performances. RCA settled the case out of court in December 1990, agreeing to pay Wash a &quot;substantial&quot; fee. The company also signed her to an eight-album recording contract and financed her national tour. Wash&#x27;s lawsuit also resulted in federal legislation in the United States, making vocal credit mandatory for all albums and music videos.

<text>The Battle of Hatfield Chase (; ) was fought on 12 October 633 It pitted the Northumbrians against an alliance of Gwynedd and Mercia. The Northumbrians were led by Edwin and the Gwynedd-Mercian alliance was led by Cadwallon ap Cadfan and Penda. The site of the battle was a marshy area about northeast of Doncaster on the south bank of the River Don, though this location has been disputed. It was a decisive victory for Gwynedd and the Mercians: Edwin was killed and his army defeated, leading to the temporary collapse of Northumbria.

==Background==
Edwin, the most powerful ruler in Britain at the time, had seemingly defeated Cadwallon a few years before the battle. Bede refers to Edwin establishing his rule over what he called the Mevanian islands, one of which was Anglesey, and another source refers to Cadwallon being besieged on the island of Priestholm (AC: Glannauc), which is off the coast of Anglesey. Later, Cadwallon defeated and drove the Northumbrians from his territories and then allied with Penda (Cadwallon being the stronger member of the alliance). Penda&#x27;s status in Mercia at this time is uncertain—Bede suggests he was not yet king, but became king soon after Hatfield; the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, however, says that he became king in 626.

==Results of the battle==
The battle was a disaster for Northumbria. With both Edwin and his son Osfrith killed, and his other son Eadfrith captured by Penda (and later killed), the kingdom was divided between its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Eanfrith, a son of the former king Æthelfrith, returned from exile to take power in Bernicia, while Edwin&#x27;s cousin Osric took over Deira. Cadwallon continued to wage a war against the Northumbrians, and was not stopped until he was defeated by Oswald at the Battle of Heavenfield (also known as Deniseburna, AC : Cantscaul) a year after Hatfield.

The historian D. P. Kirby suggested that the defeat of Edwin was the outcome of a wide-ranging alliance of interests opposed to him, including the deposed Bernician line of Æthelfrith; but considering the subsequent hostility between Cadwallon and Æthelfrith&#x27;s sons, such an alliance must not have survived the battle for long.

==Challenged location==
An investigation group has challenged the alleged site of the battle, mooted as being near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, suggesting an alternative location of nearby Cuckney, Nottinghamshire, at a place called locally &quot;High Hatfield&quot;, with an ancient name of &#x27;Cukeney upon Hattfeild&#x27;.

During the 1950s workmen undertaking underpinning work at St Mary&#x27;s Church (responding to subsidence due to local coal mining) uncovered a mass grave, which was thought to predate the 1100s church.

The group, known as the Battle of Hatfield Investigation Society (BOHIS), received grants from Heritage Lottery Fund of £15,600 in 2016, enabling ground penetrating radar surveys to take place identifying places where further mass burials could be located. The Diocese of Southwell refused permission for excavations on the locations identified in November 2017. 

In April 2018 the group was awarded a further £58,000 from lottery funding and a private donation, to cover costs of LIDAR scanning and opening archaeological trenches in fields surrounding church land.

<text>The Nakajima B5N (, Allied reporting name &quot;Kate&quot;) was the standard carrier-based torpedo bomber of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) for much of World War II. It also served as a high level bomber.

Although the B5N was substantially faster and more capable than its Allied counterparts, the American Douglas TBD Devastator monoplane (the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first all-metal, carrier-borne monoplane of any type with retracting gear), and the British Fairey Swordfish and Fairey Albacore torpedo biplanes, it was nearing obsolescence by 1941. Nevertheless, the B5N operated throughout the whole war, due to the delayed development of its successor, the B6N.

In the early part of the Pacific War, when flown by well-trained IJN aircrews and as part of well-coordinated attacks, the B5N achieved particular successes at the battles of Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Midway, and Santa Cruz Islands.

==Design and development==
The B5N was designed by a team led by Katsuji Nakamura in response to a 1935 specification by the Navy for a torpedo bomber to replace the Yokosuka B4Y. Internally designated Type K by Nakajima, it successfully competed with the Mitsubishi B5M for a production contract. The first prototype flew in January 1937 and was ordered into production soon afterwards with the full designation Type 97 Carrier Attack Bomber (九七式艦上攻撃機) (&quot;kyū-nana-shiki kanjō kōgeki-ki&quot; or &quot;kankō&quot; for short).

Combat experience during the Second Sino-Japanese War revealed several weaknesses in the original B5N1 production model. These were mainly concerned with the lack of protection that the design offered its crew and its fuel tanks. Keen to maintain the high performance of the type, the Navy was reluctant to add weight in the form of armor, and instead looked to obtaining a faster version of the aircraft in the hopes of outrunning enemy fighters. The B5N2 was given a much more powerful engine - Nakajima&#x27;s own &quot;Sakae&quot; Model 11, 14-cylinder twin-row radial, as used in the initial models of the Mitsubishi A6M fighter – and various modifications were made to streamline it. Although its performance was only marginally better, and its weaknesses remained unremedied, this version replaced the B5N1 in production and service from 1939.

==Equipment==
The navigator/bombardier/observer position was equipped with a Type 90 bombsight, which was a long vertical tube located in the front-left of the seat. There was also a Type 3 reflector compass for precise navigation that was mounted on the top of the cockpit frame. The radio-operator/gunner position was equipped with one of the standard-issue radio sets for navy three-seater aircraft (Type 96 Mk3 earlier and Type 2 Mk3 later) that was mounted in front of the radio-operator/gunner&#x27;s seat and behind the navigator/bombardier/observer&#x27;s seat.

The radio-operator/gunner also operated one flexible 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 92 machine gun at the rear end of the cockpit. One Type 91 torpedo could be mounted on the racks that were fixed eccentrically to the right at the bottom of the fuselage. Alternatively, racks could be replaced to carry either one 800 kg bomb (e.g., Type 99 No 80 armor-piercing bomb) or two 250 kg bombs (e.g., Type 98 No 25 land bomb) or six 60 kg bombs (e.g., Type 2 No 6 land bomb). Replacing the racks and exchanging between the torpedo and bombs was not a trivial process and could take more than two hours to complete.

Initially, most of the B5N bombers were painted in silver, which was the color used throughout the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The color eventually changed to dark green before the start of the Pacific War.

==Operational history==


The B5N was primarily employed as a carrier-based aircraft and occasionally as a land-based bomber. It carried a crew of three: pilot, navigator/bombardier/observer, and radio-operator/gunner. As with other IJN multi-seat aircraft, an individual bomber was commanded by the senior ranking crew member aboard, which could be the observer rather than the pilot.

The initial model B5N1 first saw action in the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938. The updated B5N2 played a major role in the Attack on Pearl Harbor. One of the B5N2s carried Mitsuo Fuchida, the commander of the attack, with one high-level bomber from the carrier credited with sinking the American battleship . The B5N2 torpedo bombers also sank the battleships , , and . Five torpedo bombers were shot down in the first wave. Apart from this raid, the greatest successes of the B5N2 were the key roles it played in sinking the United States Navy aircraft carrier at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the aircraft carrier at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, and the disabling of the aircraft carrier at the Battle of Midway, later sunk by the .

B5N2 torpedo bombers normally performed a coordinated attack on enemy carriers with Aichi D3A dive bombers. Ideally, dive bombers would help to suppress the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft fire, which improved the chances of success for the slow-flying torpedo bombers. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, the IJN tried to minimize losses to torpedo bombers and initially sent only the dive bombers to attack and cripple US carriers for the subsequent torpedo strike, this proved unsuccessful, as the torpedo bombers did not launch until the battle was over.

The B5N served as the basis for a follow-on design, the B6N, which eventually replaced it in front-line service. The B5N continued to fly in secondary roles, such as training, target towing, and anti-submarine warfare. Some of the aircraft used for this latter purpose were equipped with early radars and magnetic anomaly detectors. B5Ns were also used as bombers during the unsuccessful defense of the Philippines in October 1944, suffering severe losses. Later in the war, they were used for &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks.

==Variants==
*Type K: Prototype.
*B5N1: First production model.
*B5N1-K: Many B5N1s were converted into advanced training aircraft.
*B5N2: Improved version.

==Operators==
* Imperial Japanese Navy

==Surviving aircraft==
None of the 1,150 production B5Ns survived World War II intact. Only two partially-recovered B5Ns are known to exist, neither of them airworthy.

Replicas of the B5N2s were made using stretched fuselages from U.S. Canadian Car and Foundry &quot;Harvard&quot; - a variant of the North American T-6 Texan trainers, which were modified to represent Japanese aircraft for the movie &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, and have been used in a number of movies and airshows since to depict the aircraft.

One recovered B5N2 is at the Wings Museum in Balcombe, West Sussex, UK. This large portion was recovered from the Kuril Islands by a British private collector in 2003.

A B5N was unveiled at the Pacific Aviation Museum in Honolulu, Hawaii on 18 April 2016.

<text>Haier Group Corporation () is a Chinese multinational home appliances and consumer electronics company headquartered in Qingdao, Shandong. Its Haier Smart Home Company affiliate, of which it owns 35%, designs, develops, manufactures and sells home appliances including refrigerators, air conditioners, washing machines, dryers, and microwave ovens under the brand names Haier, Casarte, Leader, GE Appliances, Fisher &amp; Paykel, Aqua and Candy. Its Haier Electronics Group affiliate manufactures consumer electronics such as mobile phones, computers, and televisions. Its Thunderobot brand is focused on gaming computers and accessories. Haier Smart Home Company is ranked 407th on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500.

According to Euromonitor International, Haier was the number one brand globally in major appliances for 10 consecutive years from 2009 to 2018. The Haier brand was also recognized by BrandZ in 2019 as the most valuable IoT ecosystem brand in the world, with a brand value of $16.3 billion.

Haier Group has two publicly traded affiliates that trade on three stock exchanges: Haier Smart Home (海尔智家) ( as well as &quot;D-share&quot; listing of Haier Smart Home in China Europe International Exchange of Frankfurt; ex-Qingdao Haier Co., Ltd.) and Haier Electronics Group Co., Ltd. (). In 1993, it listed its Qingdao Haier Refrigerator Co. subsidiary on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, raising CN¥370 million. In 2005, Haier entered the Hong Kong Stock Exchange through a &quot;backdoor listing&quot; by acquiring a controlling stake in a publicly listed joint venture Haier-CCT Holdings Ltd. ().

==History==
The origins of Haier date back to a refrigerator factory built in Qingdao to supply the Chinese market in the 1920s. After the 1949 establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the factory was then taken over and turned into a state-owned enterprise.

By the 1980s, the factory had a debt of over CN¥1.4 million and suffered from dilapidated infrastructure, poor management, and lack of quality controls, resulting from the planned economic system and relevant policies. Production had slowed, rarely surpassing 80 refrigerators a month, and the factory was close to bankruptcy. The Qingdao government hired a young assistant city-manager, Zhang Ruimin, responsible for a number of city-owned appliance companies. Zhang was appointed the managing director of the factory in 1984.

===Founding===
Haier was founded as Qingdao Refrigerator Co. in 1984. With China opening up to world markets, foreign corporations began searching for partnerships in China. One of these, Germany&#x27;s refrigerator company Liebherr, entered into a joint-venture contract with Qingdao Refrigerator Co., offering technology and equipment to its Chinese counterpart. Refrigerators were to be manufactured under the name of Qindao-Liebherr (). The current brand &quot;Haier&quot; came from the last two syllables of the Chinese transliteration of Liebherr ().

The installation of Liebherr&#x27;s equipment and technology was accompanied by new quality control and management processes. By 1986, Qingdao Refrigerator had returned to profitability and grew in sales at an average of 83 percent annually. Between 1984 and 2000, sales grew from CNY ¥3.5 million to ¥40.5 billion.

In 1988, the municipal government asked Haier to take over some of the city&#x27;s other ailing appliance manufacturers. The company assumed control of Qingdao Electroplating Company (manufacturing microwave ovens). In 1991, the company changed its name to &quot;Qingdao Haier Group&quot; and acquired Qingdao Air Conditioner Plant and Qingdao Freezer. The company&#x27;s name was simplified to its current name &quot;Haier&quot; in 1992. In 1995, the company took over Qingdao Red Star Electronics Co., a washing machine manufacturer, along with five of its subsidiaries. Haier acquired seven companies between 1995 and 1997, and began exporting to foreign markets.

===International expansion===
In Southeast Asia, Haier opened production facilities in Indonesia in 1996 and the Philippines in 1997 and failed in an attempt to enter the Thai market due to the presence of local competitors.

Haier entered the US market in 1999. In the US it focused upon two niche markets in compact refrigerators and electric wine cellars. Haier began to manufacture full-sized refrigerators for North American market. This would bring it into direct competition with established American companies GE, Whirlpool, Frigidaire, and Maytag. As part of its strategy, Haier built a production facility in the United States at Camden, South Carolina, opened in 2000. By 2002, US revenues reached USD $200 million, still small compared to its overall revenue of $7 billion. Also in 2002, Haier moved into the Greenwich Savings Bank Building in midtown Manhattan. Formerly the headquarters for the Greenwich Savings Bank, the building was built in 1924 in the neo-classical style.

Production facilities were constructed in Pakistan in 2002 (see Haier Pakistan) and Jordan in 2003. In Africa, Haier has plants in five countries: Tunisia, Nigeria, Egypt, Algeria and South Africa. The company also purchased a Meneghetti&#x27;s factory in Italy and began placing its products in European retail chains, either under its own brand or under OEM agreements with foreign partners. 

Haier Appliances (India) P. Ltd initiated its commercial operations in January 2004. Its headquarters is in New Delhi, and in 2015 it had 33 operations, including those in Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, and Kolkata. It was listed among the top 20 most trusted brands in India by The Brand Trust Report, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory.

In June 2005, Haier bid to acquire Maytag Corporation, backed by private equity funds Blackstone Group and Bain Capital. The bid was for US$1.28 billion, or $16 per share, topping a previous offer of $14.26 per share made by Ripplewood Holdings. However, Maytag was bought by Michigan-based Whirlpool Corporation which offered $1.7 billion in cash and stock, or $21 per share, plus assumed debt.

In 2008, Haier entered into a joint venture agreement with the government of Venezuela.

In 2009, Haier surpassed Whirlpool to become the fourth largest refrigerator producer in terms of sales with a global market share of 6.3%.

In 2012, Haier Group acquired the appliance business from New Zealand-based Fisher &amp; Paykel, and Sanyo&#x27;s Southeast Asian appliance manufacturing unit.

In June 2016, Haier Group acquired GE Appliances, headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, from General Electric for $5.6 billion.

In October 2018, Haier acquired Italy based Candy group.

By 2020, Haier had been the world&#x27;s number one home appliance brand for 12 consecutive years.

In 2024, Haier Smart Home is spearheading the AI evolution in the appliance industry, offering a strategic blueprint for global executives to leverage AI for transformative growth and enhanced user experiences.

In October 2024, Haier Smart Home acquired Carrier Commercial Refrigeration from Carrier Global for $775 million.

== Technology ==
In 2015, Haier began investigating how the internet of things could be integrated into its devices. The company cited by the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, which found three barriers to the adoption of smart home technology: lack of unified protocols/single point of access, passive services and the lack of complete solutions. At the time Haier&#x27;s core competencies lay within the large appliance sector and not the small electronics sector. Subsequently, it partnered with the then leading IoT platform IngDan () owned by Cogobuy to overcome its shortcomings. By utilising Cogobuy&#x27;s ecosystem and supply chain, Haier was able to integrate IngDan&#x27;s portfolio of components, modules, and edge voice analysis into smart appliance products. Haier introduced its smart appliances across seven product lines in the major appliance industry: air, water, clothes care, security, voice control, health and information.

== Company strategy ==
Zhang Ruimin, soon after becoming managing director in 1985, ordered his employees to destroy 76 refrigerators with sledgehammers following a customer complaint in an effort to radically change the company&#x27;s culture to one that embodies quality control practices. At the time, Chinese brands for domestically produced consumer goods were generally regarded by overseas consumer markets as being of poor quality, even when compared subjectively with foreign brands manufactured in China. The cultural transformation towards quality driven manufacturing resulted in Haier becoming the first company in China to get ISO 9001 certification.

Haier also has an environmental sustainable development strategy to improve the environment by conserving energy and recycling. In 2018, Haier got the &quot;Greener China Business Award&quot; due to its outstanding efforts to protect the environment. In 2015, Haier joined WIPO GREEN as an official partner in an effort to address climate change. Haier also announced a three-year partnership with the Australian Open in November 2024.

== Controversy ==
In 2014, Haier was accused by German media of delivering smartphones and tablets with pre-installed malware.

In 2024, Haier sent cease and desist letters to the open-source projects hOn and pyhOn, which developed an add-on for Home Assistant that allowed one to control appliances without Haier&#x27;s 3rd-party cloud service.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and subsequent international sanctions, Haier faced criticism for its continued expansion in the Russian market. Haier announced plans to increase production in Naberezhnye Chelny, including facilities for refrigerators, washing machines, and televisions, along with the establishment of a fourth factory and plans to recruit developers in Russia for its proprietary OS for smart appliances. The company also plans to repurpose Candy’s factory in Kirov to further expand its manufacturing capabilities in Russia. Despite global calls for corporate responsibility, Haier has significantly increased its revenue in Russia, reportedly more than 1.5 times in 2023 compared to 2022.

<doc id="538455" wikidata="Q749011" url="?curid=538455" title="Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)">
<text>Dawn of the Dead is a 2004 action horror film directed by Zack Snyder in his feature directorial debut, with a screenplay by James Gunn. A remake of George A. Romero&#x27;s 1978 film of the same name, it stars an ensemble cast that includes Sarah Polley, Jake Weber, Ving Rhames, and Mekhi Phifer, with Scott Reiniger, Tom Savini, and Ken Foree from the original film appearing in cameos. Set in Milwaukee, the film follows a group of survivors who try to survive a zombie apocalypse holed up in a suburban shopping mall.

Producers Eric Newman and Marc Abraham developed the film rather as a &quot;re-envisioning&quot; of the original &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, aiming to reinvigorate the zombie genre for modern audiences. They bought the rights from co-producer Richard P. Rubinstein (who produced the original) and hired Gunn to write the script, which oriented the original&#x27;s premise around the action genre. Intent on making the remake a straight horror, Snyder took over to direct with the goal of keeping every aspect of the production as grounded in reality as possible. Filming took place from June to September 2003, on location at a Toronto shopping mall that was slated for demolition. The special makeup effects were created by David LeRoy Anderson, and the music was composed by Tyler Bates in his first collaboration with Snyder.

&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was theatrically released on March 19, 2004, by Universal Pictures. Despite Romero&#x27;s distaste for it, the film earned generally positive reviews from critics, who saw improvements over the original in terms of acting, production values, and scares. However they felt it lacked character development, was excessively gory and also indifferent to Romero&#x27;s preoccupation with consumerism. &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was a commercial success, grossing $102.3 million worldwide on a $26 million budget. Retrospective reviews have called it Snyder&#x27;s best film. A spiritual successor, &quot;Army of the Dead&quot;, was released in 2021.

==Plot==

After finishing a long shift as a nurse in the Milwaukee area, Ana returns to her suburban neighborhood and her husband, Luis. Caught up in a scheduled date night, they miss several emergency news bulletins. The next morning, a zombified neighborhood girl, Vivian, enters their bedroom and kills Luis, who immediately reanimates and attacks Ana. She flees the chaotic neighborhood in her car, crashes, and passes out. 

Upon awakening, Ana joins police sergeant Kenneth Hall, electronics salesman Michael, petty criminal Andre and his pregnant wife Luda. They break into a nearby mall and are attacked by a zombified security guard, who scratches Luda. Three living guards — C.J., Bart, and Terry — force them to surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. Together they secure the mall. On the roof, they see another survivor, Andy, stranded in his gun store across the zombie-infested parking lot. The group notices a military helicopter and attempts to get the pilot&#x27;s attention, but to no avail.

The next day, a delivery truck carrying survivors enters the lot, pursued by zombies. C.J. and Bart want to turn them away but are overruled and disarmed. The newcomers include Norma, Steve, Tucker, Monica, Glen, Frank and his daughter Nicole. Another woman is too ill to walk; she is wheeled inside, only to die and reanimate. After she is killed, the group determines the disease is passed by bites. Frank, who has been bitten, elects to be isolated. When he dies and turns, Kenneth shoots him. Andre leaves to see Luda, who has hidden her scratch.

Kenneth and Andy start a friendship, communicating with messages written on whiteboards; romance also buds between Ana and Michael, and Nicole and Terry. When the power goes out, C.J., Bart, Michael and Kenneth go to the parking garage to activate the emergency generator; they find a friendly dog named Chips, signifying a breach. Zombies attack and kill Bart, forcing the others to douse the zombies in gas and set them ablaze. Meanwhile, Luda — tied up by Andre — dies giving birth and reanimates as Norma checks on the couple. When Norma kills the zombified Luda, Andre snaps; they exchange gunfire and both are killed. The others arrive to find a zombie infant, which they kill immediately. The group plans to get to the local marina, find Steve&#x27;s yacht and travel to an island on Lake Michigan. They reinforce two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape.

To rescue Andy, the group straps supplies onto Chips&#x27;s body and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips enters Andy&#x27;s store safely, but a zombie follows through the dog door. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where a now zombified Andy traps her. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers, kill Andy, and rescue Nicole. They grab ammunition and go back to the mall; along the way, Tucker breaks his legs, and C.J. mercy-kills him. Back to the mall, they are unable to lock the door, forcing an evacuation via the buses.

The survivors fight their way out as the buses drive to the marina. Glen loses control of a chainsaw, accidentally killing himself and Monica; blood splatters on the windshield, causing their bus to crash. Steve leaves the group and is killed by a stowaway zombie. While C.J., Kenneth, and Terry leaves the other bus to look for survivors, Ana kills the zombified Steve and retrieves his boat keys. Eventually the remaining survivors get to the marina, and C.J. sacrifices himself so the others can escape. Michael reveals a bite wound and kills himself as Ana, Kenneth, Nicole, Terry, and Chips sail away on the yacht.

Footage from a camcorder found on the boat shows Steve&#x27;s escapades before the outbreak and concludes as the group runs out of supplies, approaches an island, and is attacked by a swarm of zombies before the camcorder drops.

==Cast==


Additional members of the cast include stuntman Ermes Blarasin as the bloated woman, Natalie Brown as a CDC reporter, and dog actor Blu as Nicole&#x27;s adopted pet dog Chips. Director Zack Snyder cameos as a soldier battling zombies at the United States Capitol during the film&#x27;s title sequence. There are also cameo appearances by Scott Reiniger, Tom Savini, and Ken Foree (who were in the original film) as a general, sheriff, and televangelist, respectively.

==Production==
===Development===
Plans to remake 1978&#x27;s &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; were conceived by producer Eric Newman, a fan of zombie films who cited the George A. Romero horror film as the best in this genre. With the remake, Newman and producer Marc Abraham wanted to reinvigorate the zombie genre for modern audiences as well as &quot;make the old fans happy and make a lot of new fans&quot;. Newman and Abraham bought the rights to &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; from its producer and rights holder Richard P. Rubinstein, who was reluctant at first as he was &quot;concerned that somewhere along the way a studio would sanitize Newman&#x27;s vision for producing a version with &#x27;attitude&#x27;&quot;, but that it was &quot;Marc Abraham&#x27;s long track record in keeping the creative integrity of the studio distributed films he has produced intact that gave me reason to say &#x27;yes&#x27;&quot;. Newman hired James Gunn to write the script, and the studio brought Gunn in despite not wanting to deliver them a signal idea for the film beforehand. A fan of the original &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; since he was a young boy, Gunn explained that he took the job because he &quot;kind of saw generally what it could be&quot;.
The producers conceptualized the remake as more of a &quot;re-envisioning&quot; which would work in some references to the original but would primarily work on its own terms. Co-producer Eric Newman cited &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot; (1978), &quot;The Thing&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Fly&quot; (1986) as influences on the remake, considering these to be &quot;amazing updates&quot; as well as &quot;great movies that add to rather than diminish the original films&quot;. By way of respect to Romero&#x27;s film, the producers cast the original&#x27;s Tom Savini, Scott Reiniger, and Ken Foree in cameos; and incorporated visual references to Gaylen Ross and James A. Baffico.

In writing the script, Gunn took an action-oriented approach while remaining faithful to the basic premise of Romero&#x27;s version. To develop the plot, he declined to write a treatment in favor of a discovery writing method whereby he would devise hypothetical situations which would ultimately force the characters to evacuate the mall. Gunn decided to leave the origin of the zombie outbreak ambiguous, believing this would give not only equal consideration to each audience&#x27;s viewpoint (scientific or otherwise) but also something to think about what they would do if they found themselves in a similar situation. The script was given uncredited rewrites by Michael Tolkin and Scott Frank; co-producer Richard P. Rubinstein said Tolkin further developed the characters while Frank provided some of the bigger, upbeat action scenes. Gunn revealed he received internet backlash over the film due to his past screenwriting credit on &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (2002), believing him to be unqualified for the job. However, film critic Harry Knowles, initially an opponent of the remake, read Gunn&#x27;s script and gave it a positive response on his website Ain&#x27;t It Cool News, which Gunn said helped eliminate doubts cast upon him by fans of the original.

====Theme====
With &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, Gunn wanted to explore the human condition as well as tell a wholly different story about redemption. He elaborated on the redemptive theme of the film in an interview with &quot;IGN&quot; during a press junket for &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot; released that same year:

[...] &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is about redemption because it&#x27;s about a bunch of people who have lived certain lives, who have maybe not been the best people, and suddenly they have everything that they&#x27;ve used to define themselves: Their careers, their churches, their jobs, their families are stripped away. They&#x27;re gone. They start at nothing and they have to become who they really are in the face of all that and some of the people are redeemed and end up becoming good people and some of them are not redeemed and they end up, you know, not redeemed. And that&#x27;s what kind of drove me throughout the story, was it was a story about redemption. I also think that there&#x27;s a lot about how people survive and what people turn to in the face of such tragedy. The tragedy in this case being flesh-eating zombies. And really it&#x27;s a group coming together to work as a community who wouldn&#x27;t otherwise work together. So there is that foundation of love, that basic message, within even &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;...

===Pre-production===

Zack Snyder chose to direct the remake as his first feature film because it gave the television commercial director &quot;a reason to care about every shot&quot;. Not wanting his version inevitably compared to George A. Romero&#x27;s, he concurred with the producers on reimagining the latter film as opposed to doing it as a &quot;remake&quot;, which, in his view, would have entailed re-shooting Romero&#x27;s script. For that matter, he aimed to make his film a straight horror that was &quot;as serious as a heart attack&quot; and keep every aspect of its production as grounded in reality as possible. His approach included previsualizing the film with storyboards and introducing the concept of running zombies, which he said was his &quot;fresh, new way&quot; of giving it a sense of verisimilitude and rendering zombies as if they were real threats, especially when they attack in hordes. Snyder maintained Gunn&#x27;s decision not to reveal the origin of the zombie outbreak, believing it was &quot;obvious that in this fallen society, you wouldn&#x27;t know where the whole plague started&quot;.

====Set design====
In searching for a suitable upscale mall location for the film, production designer Andrew Neskoromny looked for existing malls that were scheduled for demolition. His search yielded no results until he found the now-defunct Thornhill Square shopping mall in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which measured approximately . Dubbed the &quot;Crossroads Mall&quot;, the crew completely redid the mall over an eight-week period, adding an expensive water feature near the entrance, 14 stores, parking structures, and warehouse areas. Since Snyder wanted the stores palpable in terms of design and stood not merely as storefronts, Neskoromny&#x27;s team accordingly built them as actual retail stores complete with merchandise. These stores were given fake names, since only two major retail brands agreed to be featured in the film.

====Makeup and practical effects====
The special makeup effects for the film were created by David LeRoy Anderson, with assistance from his actress wife Heather Langenkamp. Prior to accepting the job from Universal Studios&#x27; then-executive James D. Brubaker, Anderson had been in a two-year hiatus from working as a makeup effects artist to operate his company DLA Silverwear. Anderson completed his test makeups for the film over a four-week period, and then he and his team traveled to the Toronto set and set up their makeup effects lab next to the mall.

To depict a heightened realistic look to the zombies, Anderson researched on the appearance of decay following human death, looking through several medical books, war footages, and crime scene photographs showing graphic images of trauma victims; he broke down the look of decomposition into three stages:

The first stage looks like someone who was just in the ER – pale, with lots of fresh blood. The second stage has moist wounds but the skin is beginning to break down. There is a lot of discoloration and mottling, mostly blues and greens. The third stage is the most intense, with the skeletal form coming through. The wounds are dried-up, the skin is sloughing off and colors are oily blacks.

Head hits were done practically through various methods, such as bullet hit squibs covered with prosthetic scalps and attached to the back of the actor&#x27;s head to be detonated. Concerned about the risk thereof, Anderson developed an alternative method in which his team would attach wires to the scalps loaded with blood packs and yank them with a remote-controlled &quot;air ratchet system&quot;, lending a similar gruesome effect as with the squibs sans potential harm.

===Filming and post-production===
====Principal photography====
Filming began on June 9, 2003, on location in various parts of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Hundreds of zombie extras had to be constantly available for the entire shoot. To handle the volume of willing extras, Anderson and his team built a large &quot;factory&quot; where painted extras would stay put until they are spoken for by either the main or second unit film crew. They built various makeup rooms for the artists to work in: one consisted of camper trailers where they would apply detailed prosthetic makeups to extras playing &quot;hero zombies&quot;, a special type of zombie; and the other consisted of tents where they would produce painted masks for extras playing background zombies. Extras playing foreground zombies were painted with plain palette makeups in Anderson&#x27;s mall lab. The makeup artists were given his concept images to work on as references. According to Anderson and Heather Langenkamp, the most extras they ever had in a given day sat between 200 and 400, with a total of 3,000 makeups completed when filming ended on September 6, 2003.

====Visual effects and title sequence====

The visual effects for the film were provided by Canadian VFX studio Mr. X Inc., with its president Dennis Berardi serving as the film&#x27;s co-VFX supervisor.

The production shot scenes for which Snyder wanted as many as 4,000 live-action zombies, which Berardi created rather as a combination of practical zombies and CG zombies which he built as 3D models with Autodesk Maya. One such scene involved tens of thousands of zombies at the mall&#x27;s parking lot, which was shot with motion-control passes whose green screen elements of 200 extras, combined with the CG zombies, were later composited to create a &quot;digital crowd simulation that looks realistic&quot;.

Kyle Cooper designed the title sequence for the film, using real human blood.

==Soundtrack==
===Film score===

The score for &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was composed by Tyler Bates, his first for a horror film. Bates was hired after being recommended by music supervisor, G. Marq Roswell, as both of them were involved on the Mario Van Peebles&#x27;s film &quot;Baadasssss!&quot; (2003). However, the studio was not convinced on Bates&#x27;s hiring because he was not an established composer at that time, but upon Snyder&#x27;s insistence, he was ultimately hired.

While scoring the film, Bates avoided taking cues from the original film&#x27;s music by the band Goblin, as he felt it incompatible with what Snyder had filmed. Although he liked Goblin&#x27;s themes for the counterpart, he felt it was specific to that period and Snyder&#x27;s version had a &quot;different attitude&quot; in comparison to the original film. Hence, he let go of the popular themes from the original film, including the main title theme, which he felt &quot;was cool and was a different thing&quot;. Influenced by the works of composers adept at creating dissonant themes, such as Béla Bartók and Krzysztof Penderecki, he combined elements of electronic music and 20th-century orchestra with the intention of making the audience &quot;very, very uncomfortable&quot;.

Milan Records released Bates&#x27;s score in physical format for the first time on October 23, 2012, a week after the record label released it digitally via iTunes Store and Amazon Music. The album comprises 31 tracks, all of which were composed by Bates. &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; also marks the first of several collaborations between him and Snyder: he would later compose for the director on &quot;300&quot; (2006), &quot;Watchmen&quot; (2009), and &quot;Sucker Punch&quot; (2011).

===Other songs===
In a 2023 interview with &quot;Total Film&quot;, Snyder revealed he had lobbied for the inclusion of the Richard Cheese cover of &quot;Down with the Sickness&quot;, originally sung by the heavy metal band Disturbed, which plays in a montage where the characters relieve boredom in the mall. According to Snyder, the studio originally declined the Richard Cheese version in favor of the Disturbed version, but he managed to convince them that the former was appropriate for the scene. Snyder also stated his rationale behind the decision to play &quot;People Who Died&quot; by The Jim Carroll Band at the end of the film: &quot;I really love that [opening chords of &#x27;People Who Died&#x27;] DANG! DANG! DANG, DANG, DANG! I thought that it was cool as a way to end the movie because it&#x27;s so dark. It&#x27;s a bleak ending, in a cool way.&quot;

==Release==
Universal Pictures distributed the film worldwide, excluding the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Japan, Scandinavia, Iceland, Turkey, Israel, South Africa and the Middle East. Strike Entertainment retained the film through a set of closed deals, selling the film to Entertainment Film Distributors in the United Kingdom and Ireland, Metropolitan Filmexport in France, Toho-Towa in Japan, Nordisk Film in Scandinavia, Samfilm in Iceland, Pinema in Turkey, Forum Film in Israel, Nu Metro in South Africa and Italia Film in the Middle East.

===Box office===

&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was marketed with its 10-minute opening sequence that was broadcast on cable television four nights prior to its theatrical release. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; projected that it would outperform &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; in its United States opening weekend, with an audience base comprising largely young males and estimated gross of $22 million.

In the U.S. and Canada, the film was released alongside &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; and &quot;Taking Lives&quot;, on March 19, 2004. &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; ended up performing above projections, debuting to $27.3 million in its U.S. opening weekend and claiming the top spot &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; held for three consecutive weekends. &quot;Variety&quot; reported, &quot;Some 63% of &quot;Dawn&quot; [audiences] were under age 25, with 57% of patrons male. Hispanic moviegoers comprised 21% of its supporters and African-Americans 14%.&quot; &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; ended its theatrical run as a commercial success, grossing $102 million worldwide on a $26 million budget; it grossed $59 million in the United States and Canada and $43.3 million in other territories.

The release of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; in the U.S. nearly coincided with that of &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;, another zombie film distributed by Universal Pictures. In a February 2004 &quot;Variety&quot; report, a spokesman at Universal revealed that the studio had greenlit &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; &quot;with the condition that &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; would be released here in the U.S. first&quot; in order to avoid this conflict.

&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was screened out of competition at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

===Home media===
Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital with director Zack Snyder&#x27;s unrated director&#x27;s cut of the film: he described this version as longer, gorier, and more character-driven than the theatrical one. Bonus features found on the DVD and Blu-ray include Snyder and co-producer Eric Newman&#x27;s audio commentary; the featurettes &quot;Attack of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;Raising the Dead&quot;, &quot;Drawing the Dead&quot;, &quot;Splitting Headaches&quot;, &quot;Surviving the Dawn&quot;, and &quot;Special Report: Zombie Invasion&quot;; the short film &quot;The Lost Tape: Andy&#x27;s Terrifying Last Days Revealed&quot;; deleted scenes with optional commentary by Snyder and Newman; and the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer.

On Halloween of 2017, Shout! Factory&#x27;s horror sub-label Scream Factory released a two-disc collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, which contains the film&#x27;s theatrical version and the director&#x27;s cut. The Blu-ray, which is said to have been &quot;derived from the digital intermediate archival negative&quot;, contains bonus features found in previous releases in addition to new and exclusive ones featuring interviews with actors Ty Burrell and Jake Weber, screenwriter James Gunn, and makeup effects artists David LeRoy Anderson and Heather Langenkamp. A 4K Ultra HD collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray from Scream Factory with extras ported over from the label&#x27;s previous release was released on January 31, 2023.

==Reception==
===Contemporary===

&quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; received generally positive reviews upon its release, with critics praising it as a worthy remake of the original and a fine addition to the zombie genre. The film was considered by most to be an improvement over the original in terms of acting, production values, and scares, although &quot;Variety&quot; and Derek Malcolm felt that it was only intermittently scary. Despite giving it a negative review, &quot;Variety&quot; said that the film was otherwise &quot;more palatable&quot; than the &quot;atrocious&quot; &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; remake released the previous year. Michael Gingold stated, &quot;[...] &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; joins &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; as an update that both honors its source and emerges as an effective horror film in its own right&quot;, a sentiment also shared by &quot;IGN&quot;. Lisa Schwarzbaum praised Snyder&#x27;s direction in &quot;a killer feature debut&quot;, while Roger Ebert said in a positive review that anyone paying to see it is guaranteed to get their money&#x27;s worth.

Abundant praise was given to the film&#x27;s opening sequence, which an otherwise negative review from &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called &quot;pulse-poundingly good&quot;. Gingold found Snyder&#x27;s camerawork utilizing a first-person video-game perspective at the beginning of the film to be praiseworthy, more so than those of the video game films &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (2002) and &quot;House of the Dead&quot; (2003). The lack of dark humor of the original was a source of criticism, although the scene in which survivors shoot zombified celebrity look-alikes with a sniper rifle was considered by most to be funny, among other jokes; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; cited it as some of the film&#x27;s &quot;moments of inspired audacity&quot;. Many noted that the fast-moving zombies of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; were similar to those of &quot;28 Days Later&quot;, but felt that the Danny Boyle film was &quot;darker and creepier&quot;, &quot;smarter, more rigorously structured&quot;, and could pass for a remake of the original.

Despite the general praise, some critics said the film gave scant consideration to Romero&#x27;s satirical critique of consumerism, among other sociopolitical issues. Ebert and &quot;Variety&quot; stated that whereas Romero used the shopping mall to stage a metaphor about consumer society, Snyder used it merely as a convenient shelter for his characters. Gingold lamented that unlike Romero&#x27;s film, Snyder&#x27;s provided no social commentary on racism through its Black characters Kenneth and Andre as well as the interracial relationship between Andre and Luda. In contrast, Manohla Dargis commented that Romero&#x27;s consumerist metaphor has lost its significance in the years since the original&#x27;s release, &quot;with the politics of consumption now an established academic field and shopping now considered a statement of identity&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the film&#x27;s tonal departure from Romero&#x27;s, calling it &quot;a calculated risk that paid off&quot;.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; commented that &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was content to indulge in bloody zombie killings devoid of meaning and introspection once present in the original, leaving the audience rather numbed and &quot;less mercifully handled, even at the end-credits&quot;. Wesley Morris gave a negative review in which he said the film &quot;feels like the product of the PlayStation era&quot; as opposed to a reverence for Romero. Elvis Mitchell had similar objections, writing that &quot;[t]he flesh-eaters are picked off like video-game targets&quot;. Conversely, the &quot;BBC&quot; complimented the film as a &quot;stylish, gore-drenched shoot-em-up&quot;, and Dargis attributed its appeal not to the bloody violence but to &quot;the filmmakers&#x27; commitment to genre fundamentals&quot;. Writing in a positive review, internet-based critic James Berardinelli said fans of &quot;tight, tense, graphic horror&quot; should be able to enjoy the same aplenty in &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;.

While Schwarzbaum and Dargis complimented Gunn&#x27;s script as &quot;sharp&quot; and propulsive, respectively, others took issue with what they believed to be the lack of plot and character developments. Morris found most of the characters to be too irritating that he believed audiences might want them &quot;thrown from the mall roof to the throngs of undead&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that the characters were clichéd and about as dumb as the undead, though sympathized with the &quot;tragic&quot; moral dilemma faced by Andre as an expectant father. Conversely, Berardinelli said that while there are moments in which the characters show a lack of common sense, &quot;it&#x27;s inevitable that most of them end up as one-dimensional throw-aways whose sole purpose is to increase the body count&quot; and that &quot;not many people go to a horror film looking for character development and drama&quot;. He and Ebert found the subplots of Kenneth and Andre to be &quot;touching&quot;, with Berardinelli stating that these were &quot;handled with a deft hand&quot;. Although Ebert was personally not on board with the characters&#x27; &quot;risky&quot; plan to escape from the mall in lieu of awaiting the zombies&#x27; natural death, he remarked that &quot;taking chances makes for good action scenes&quot;. Mitchell criticized the plot as &quot;strictly by the numbers&quot; and said that the climactic gun store scene &quot;shows why zombie pictures aren&#x27;t unsettling anymore&quot;.

The ensemble cast was generally praised: comments ranged from &quot;superlative&quot; and &quot;convincing down the line&quot; to &quot;respectable&quot; and &quot;annoying&quot;. Schwarzbaum and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; described Sarah Polley&#x27;s screen presence as &quot;a perfect against-type heroine&quot; with &quot;a nice anxious stare&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; was dismayed that least attention was given to Phifer&#x27;s &quot;naturally charismatic presence&quot; with such a large cast, though felt that Rhames was effective as Polley&#x27;s &quot;quietly authoritative foil&quot; and praised Jake Weber&#x27;s performance in &quot;a thankless role&quot;. While giving equal praise to Polley, Phifer, and Rhames, Gingold singled out Weber&#x27;s existentialist role as &quot;the best of all&quot;, as did the &quot;BBC&quot;, who also credited the actor with &quot;bringing a redoubtable decency and charisma to a potentially bland part, like the young Roy Scheider in &quot;Jaws&quot;&quot;.

 , &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is Zack Snyder&#x27;s highest-rated film on the website. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

===Retrospective===
In 2005, George A. Romero spoke briefly of how dissatisfied he was with &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; during an interview with actor Simon Pegg for &quot;Time Out&quot;. Romero said although the remake could pass for a good action film, he thought it was aimless and &quot;more of a video game&quot; for that matter, as well as maintained he was &quot;not terrified of things running at me&quot;. In a 2024 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Pegg said he was a fan of the film but the title, the use of which he felt merely depended on the popularity of the Romero version: &quot;They could have called it &quot;Deadish&quot;, which was a great line in the film that one of the actors used, and it still would have been a great film, but when you just take a title because people recognize it, it&#x27;s so disrespectful to the original.&quot;

Numerous publications have named &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; as Zack Snyder&#x27;s best film. Revisiting the film on its 15th anniversary in 2019, Joe Lipsett wrote the following verdict for Bloody Disgusting:

Fifteen years later, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; completely holds up. The film&#x27;s flaws are mostly at the character level, though having a dumb zombie baby and a few undeveloped red shirts in the mix is hardly a deal breaker. The action – particularly the opening scene and the propane explosion climax – in addition to the fantastic special effects makeup, the brief flirtation with found footage, and the reverence for its source text while introducing something new makes 2004&#x27;s &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; one of the best remakes on the market.

Likewise, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; has appeared on several lists of the top zombie films, including number 3 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (2012), number 12 by &quot;Empire&quot; (2020), by &quot;Collider&quot; (2021), number 17 by IndieWire (2022), and by &quot;Variety&quot; (2023); as well as the best horror films of the decade, including number 3 by Dread Central (2010), number 8 by Bloody Disgusting (2009), number 52 by &quot;IGN&quot;, and number 55 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (2020). The film made review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes&#x27;s lists of &quot;The 20 Scariest Opening Scenes in Horror Movie History&quot; (at number 6), &quot;The 25 Best Horror Movie Remakes&quot; (at number 9), &quot;The 30 Essential Zombie Movies&quot; (at number 13), and &quot;18 Memorable Horror Remakes&quot;.

In a June 2018 article for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Richard Newby wrote that &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; helped revitalize the zombie genre along with &quot;28 Days Later&quot; at a time when the United States &quot;was ripe for the re-emergence of zombie movies&quot; following the September 11 attacks, which he believes to have contributed to the Americans&#x27; &quot;increased fear of biological weapons, fervent mass militarization and the burrowing question of who exactly are the people we call our neighbors&quot;. Author Stephen King, in the forenote of the 2010 edition of his book &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;, saw what he believed to be Snyder&#x27;s subtext conveying the horrors induced by terrorist attacks, drawing parallels between the zombie apocalypse and a post-9/11 America. King described &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; as &quot;genius perfected&quot; in terms of its standing in the zombie genre. &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone and South Korean filmmaker Yeon Sang-ho consider themselves to be fans of the film, citing it as an influence upon their works &quot;Night of the Living Homeless&quot; and the &quot;Train to Busan&quot; series, respectively.

===Accolades===
==Spiritual successor==

On March 25, 2007, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Warner Bros. Pictures would produce a new zombie film from a screenplay written by Joby Harold, based on an original idea conceived by Snyder. In a statement, Snyder said that he wanted the film to feel similar to &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and &quot;300&quot; and that it would center around a father in Las Vegas &quot;who tries to save his daughter from imminent death in a zombie-infested world&quot;. At the time, Wesley Coller was attached to executive produce, with Snyder and his wife Deborah Snyder producing through Cruel &amp; Unusual Films (now known as The Stone Quarry). Snyder got the idea during &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;″s production and wanted to explore a new evolution of the zombies. The film is not a sequel to &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; but rather a spiritual successor. Snyder realized that he needed a new origin story to develop the plot and create a new incarnation of the living dead. He titled the project &quot;Army of the Dead&quot; as a tribute to the works of George A. Romero. After languishing for several years in development hell, the distribution rights to the film were acquired by Netflix in 2019, and Snyder began shooting that same year.

&quot;Army of the Dead&quot; had a week-long limited theatrical release starting May 14 prior to its wider Netflix release on May 21, 2021.

<text>The Pacific temperate rainforests of western North America is the largest temperate rain forest region on the planet as defined by the World Wildlife Fund (other definitions exist). The Pacific temperate rainforests lie along the western side of the Pacific Coast Ranges along the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America from the Prince William Sound in Alaska through the British Columbia Coast to Northern California, and are part of the Nearctic realm, as also defined by the World Wildlife Fund. The Pacific temperate rain forests are characterized by a high amount of rainfall, in some areas more than per year and moderate temperatures in both the summer and winter months ().

This ecoregion is a subregion of the Cascadia bioregion.

These rainforests occur in a number of ecoregions, which vary in their species composition, but are predominantly of conifers, sometimes with an understory of broadleaf trees, ferns and shrubs. In the WWF&#x27;s system, the ecoregions of the Pacific temperate rainforests are the Northern Pacific coastal forests, Haida Gwaii, British Columbia mainland coastal forests, Central Pacific coastal forests, Central and Southern Cascades forests, Klamath-Siskiyou forests, and Northern California coastal forests ecoregions.
==Flora==
The forests in the north contain predominantly Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;) and western hemlock (&quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot;), while those in the coastal forests are home to both species mentioned, as well as coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;), coast Douglas-fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;), western redcedar (&quot;Thuja plicata&quot;) and shore pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;). Notably, many of the world&#x27;s largest and tallest tree species are found in this ecoregion. Dense growths of epiphytes and mosses cover the trees, and lush vegetation is present everywhere.

Hardwood trees such as the bigleaf maple and the alder are also common, especially at lower elevations and along stream banks, and are vital to the ecosystem, in part because of their nitrogen fixing.

==History==
About 200 million years ago (during the Triassic and Jurassic periods), the landscape was dominated by conifers, which were the most diverse group of trees and constituted the greatest majority of large trees. When flowering plants emerged (in the following Cretaceous period), they quickly prevailed, causing most conifers to become extinct, and those that survived to adapt to harsh conditions. Perhaps the most significant difference in this change is that the primitive conifers invested their energy in the basic food supply for every seed, with no certainty of fertilization; by contrast, flowering plants create the food supply for a seed only after it is triggered by fertilization. The Pacific temperate rainforests now remains the only region on Earth of noteworthy size and significance where, due to unique climatic conditions, the conifers flourish as they did before being displaced by flowering plants. The northern Pacific temperate rain forests are relatively young, emerging in the past few thousand years following the retreat of the ice sheets of the last ice age.

==Ecology==

The ecosystem of Pacific temperate rainforests is so productive that the biomass on the best sites is at least four times greater than that of any comparable area in the tropics. In sheer mass of living and decaying material - trees, mosses, shrubs, and soil - these forests are more massive than any other ecosystem on the planet. In part, this is due to the rarity of fire. Unlike drier forests, which burn periodically, temperate rain forests are naturally subject to only small-scale disturbances, such as blow-downs and avalanches.

This rain forest spans a wide range of latitude - from about 40 degrees north to about 60 degrees north. The differences in climate from south to north create several major forest zones, characterized by different species.
* At the southern limit in northern California is the &quot;coast redwood zone&quot;.
* Beginning at the California/Oregon border, and extending through the north end of Vancouver Island is the &quot;seasonal rain forest zone&quot;. The major tree species here are Douglas fir, western red cedar, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock.
* Beyond the northern end of Vancouver Island, is the &quot;perhumid rain forest zone&quot;. Douglas fir wanes as a dominant species, and the forest is primarily made up of western red cedar, Sitka spruce, and western hemlock.
* The Gulf of Alaska begins where the fjords of southeast Alaska end, and marks the transition into &quot;sub-polar rain forest&quot;. Here the forest occupies only a very narrow strip between the ocean and the icy alpine zone. The cedar trees no longer thrive in this harsher climate, and the dominant trees are limited to Sitka spruce, and western and mountain hemlock.
* The northern limits of the rainforest are scattered in thin bands in the northern Prince William Sound, Kenai Fjords, eastern Kodiak Island, and western Cook Inlet.

==Wildlife==
The first survey to systematically explore the forest canopy in the Carmanah Valley of Vancouver Island yielded 15,000 new species, a third of all invertebrates known to exist in all of Canada. Among the collection were 500 species previously unknown to science. Common individuals include raccoons, opossums, coyotes, black-tailed deer, ensatinas, red foxes, bullfrogs, banana slugs, Roosevelt elk, black slugs, shrew moles, gulls, mice, and numerous other organisms. Moose rarely set foot into these forests because they prefer colder, drier and snowier biomes which are most common in the inland Western United States compared to the coast, but small sightings of moose have been reported along the British Columbia coast.

The rain forest exists in a complicated landscape of islands and fjords, and many species depend on both the forest and the ocean. Salmon are one of the primary species of the rainforest, spawning in the forest streams. The marbled murrelet nests in old growth trees at night, but feeds in the ocean during the day.

Many of the most iconic photos of these forests include a large bear somewhere in the frame. Grizzly bears and black bears once thrived throughout the rain forest zone and beyond. Black bears can still be found throughout the forest&#x27;s range, while grizzlies are largely confined to areas north of the Canada–US border. These forests have some of the largest concentrations of grizzly bears in the world, mainly due to the region&#x27;s rich salmon streams. The Great Bear Rainforest in Canada is home to the rare white variant of the black bear known as the Kermode bear, also known colloquially as the &quot;spirit bear.&quot; The endangered spotted owl was at the center of logging controversies in Oregon and Washington. Other wildlife species of note include the bald eagle, marbled murrelet, wolf, mountain lion and sitka deer.

==Logging==
Pacific temperate rainforests have been subject to ongoing large-scale industrial logging since the end of World War II, cutting over half of their total area. In California, only 4% of the redwoods have been protected. In Oregon and Washington, less than 10% of the original coastal rainforest area remains.

An even larger percentage of the productive forest has been logged. Much of the land is rock, ice, muskeg, or less productive forest on steep slopes. The stereotypical old growth is limited to lowland flats and valleys, which have been preferentially targeted for logging. Historically, the most common protocol has been to place protected areas in the mountains, leaving the valleys to the timber industry. So while some very large areas are protected as parks and monuments, very little of the highest-value habitat has been protected, and much of it has already been cut.

In the Tongass National Forest, in the 1950s, in part to aid in Japanese recovery from World War II, the US Forest Service set up long term contracts with two pulp mills: the Ketchikan Pulp Company (KPC) and the Alaska Pulp Company (APC). These contracts were for 50 years, and divided up the forest into areas slated for APC logs and areas slated for KPC logs. These two companies conspired to drive log prices down, conspired to drive smaller logging operations out of business, and were major and recalcitrant polluters of their local areas. These long term contracts guaranteed low prices to the pulp companies — in some cases resulting in trees being given away for less than the price of a hamburger. Since 1980, the US Forest Service has lost over a billion dollars in Tongass timber sales.

Half a million acres (2,000 km2) of the Tongass was selected by native corporations under the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Much of this area has been clearcut.

The most controversial timber sales in the Tongass are in the roadless areas. In September 2006, a landmark court decision overturned President George W. Bush&#x27;s repeal of the Roadless Rule, reverting the 2001 roadless area protections established under President Clinton. However, the Tongass was exempted from that ruling and it is unclear what the fate of its vast roadless areas will be.

<text>Opera (formerly Opera Software AS) is a Norwegian multinational technology corporation headquartered in Oslo, Norway with additional offices in Europe, China, and Africa. Opera offers a range of products and services that include a variety of PC and mobile web browsers, GameMaker and gaming portals, the Opera News content recommendation products, the Opera Ads platform, and a number of Web3 and e-commerce products and services. The company&#x27;s total user base is 311 million monthly active users.

On 27 July 2018, Opera Limited became a public company listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, raising $115 million in its initial public offering.

==History==
=== Early development ===
Opera Software was founded as an independent company in Norway in 1995 by the Icelandic Jon Stephenson von Tetzchner and Geir Ivarsøy. They had initially begun development of the Opera web browser while both working at Norwegian telecommunications company Telenor.

Opera Software&#x27;s first product, the Opera web browser version 2.10 for Windows, was publicly released in 1996. Opera began development of its first browser for mobile device platforms in 1998. Opera 4.0, released in 2000, included a new cross-platform core that facilitated creation of editions of Opera for multiple operating systems and platforms.

Up to this point, the Opera browser was trialware and had to be purchased after the trial period ended, however, this ended with version 5.0, released in 2000. Instead, Opera became ad-sponsored, displaying advertisements to users without a license, which was commonly criticized as a barrier to gaining market share. In newer versions, the user was allowed a choice of generic graphical banners or text-based targeted advertisements provided by Google based upon the page being viewed.

=== First IPO and public company ===
In February 2004, Opera Software announced it was preparing for an initial public offering on the Oslo Stock Exchange in March. On 11 March, Opera&#x27;s IPO opened, trading under the symbol OPERA.

In 2004, Opera Software settled a lawsuit with an &quot;international corporation&quot; paying to Opera. It was speculated that the &quot;international corporation&quot; named in the statement announcing the settlement was Microsoft, which had previously blocked Opera users from correctly viewing MSN.com.

On 12 January 2005, Opera Software announced that it would offer free licenses to higher education institutions — a change from the previous cost of US$1,000 for unlimited licenses. Schools that opted for the free license included Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, University of Oxford, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Duke University.

With version 8.5 (released in 2005) the advertisements were removed entirely and primary financial support came through revenue from Google (Opera&#x27;s default search engine). In August 2005, the company introduced Opera Mini, a new Java ME based web browser for mobile phones originally marketed not to end users but to mobile network operators to pre-load on phones or offer for their subscribers. In 2007, Opera filed a complaint against Microsoft in the European Commission, alleging that bundling Internet Explorer with Microsoft Windows is harmful to both the consumer and to other web browser companies. The complaint resulted in the creation of BrowserChoice.eu.

In 2011, development directors Rolf Assev and Christen Krogh, decided to quit Opera to try something new.

In 2012, Opera Software and Bharti Airtel signed an agreement to provide Opera Mini browsers to Airtel mobile customers. In 2013 Opera Software decided to not use their in-house rendering engine for the Desktop Browser anymore. From Version 15, the Opera browser for computers would be using the Blink rendering engine, a fork of Webkit developed together with Google.

In March 2015, Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Opera won Global Mobile Award of Best Mobile Product, Initiative or Service in Emerging Markets for Opera Web Pass and Sponsored Web Pass. In April Opera Software decided to centre development of the Opera Desktop browser in Poland. On 12 April, Opera TV AS (now Vewd Software AS) was established to separate TV-related business from all other assets, which became part of Opera Software AS; both companies became wholly owned subsidiaries of Opera Software ASA (now Otello). In September, the company announced a rebrand with a new three-dimensional &quot;O&quot; logo and brand identity. In the process, the company logotype changed from &quot;Opera Software&quot; to &quot;Opera&quot;.

=== Acquisition and second IPO ===
In 2016, the company changed ownership when a group of Chinese investors purchased the web browser, consumer business, and brand of Opera Software ASA. The remaining assets were renamed as the Otello Corporation. The ownership change was initiated in February 2016 when a group of Chinese investors offered US$1.2 billion ($8.31 per share) to buy Opera Software ASA, though the deal reportedly did not meet regulatory approval. On 18 July 2016, Opera Software ASA announced it had sold its browser, privacy and performance apps, and the Opera brand to Golden Brick Capital Private Equity Fund I Limited Partnership (a consortium of Chinese investors led by &quot;Beijing Kunlun Tech Co&quot; and Qihoo 360) for an amount of US$600 million. The transaction for sale of Opera&#x27;s consumer business was approved on 31 October 2016 by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. An earlier deal was not approved by Norwegian regulators. On 4 November 2016, Golden Brick Capital Private Equity Fund I L.P. completed the acquisition. After divesting itself of the Opera browser and brand, Opera Software ASA changed its name to Otello Corporation ASA.

In January 2017, the company introduced Opera Neon, a new concept browser that is intended as an exploration of browser design alternatives. The browser is built on top of the Blink engine similar to the original Opera browser, and it is available for Windows and macOS. In January 2018, Opera launched &quot;Opera News&quot;, an AI-driven news app dedicated to African users. It reached more than a million downloads in less than a month. In April, the company released a new mobile browser called &quot;Opera Touch&quot;. It includes an innovative user interface focused on ease of use and one-handed browsing. In July 2018, Opera filed for an IPO. The company went public on the NASDAQ on 27 July and raised over $115 million. Opera is a subsidiary of Kunlun Tech Co., Ltd., and controlled by Zhou Yahui.

=== Acquisitions ===
In November 2019, Opera launched a new project called &quot;Opera News Hub&quot;. The platform helps bloggers create and share content. In January 2020, Opera acquired PocoSys, an Estonian startup that developed banking-as-a-service software. The deal also included an agreement to take over Pocopay, PocoSys&#x27;s sister company. In June 2020, Opera partnered with APO Group to provide accurate information about COVID-19 in Africa. News articles from different health authorities are collected by APO and made available to Opera users through the Opera Mini browser and Opera News app.

Opera acquired YoYo Games from Playtech in January 2021, for , from which the company also announced the launch of its Opera Gaming division to promote game development within the Opera GX browser with YoYo Games and its GameMaker game development software.

In February 2021, Opera launched the fintech Dify, an in-browser payment app that includes cashback service and a digital wallet. Customers who use Dify get reimbursed when purchasing items from partner websites like Nike, Asos, and eDreams. The fintech was first offered in beta in Spain.

== Controversies ==

Opera was involved in a years-long feud with Microsoft dating back to 2001. On at least three occasions, Opera accused Microsoft of deliberately breaking interoperability of its MSN services and the Opera browser or other non-Internet Explorer browsers. Microsoft denied that it was intentionally shutting out Opera users. In response, Opera released the &quot;Bork Edition&quot; of its web browser, causing MSN to display only the phrase, &quot;Bork, bork, bork!&quot; which was popularized by The Muppet Show character, Swedish Chef. In 2004, Opera received a confidential $12.75 million payment from an &quot;international corporation&quot; reported to be Microsoft.

In 2013, Opera switched from its rendering engine, Presto, to Chromium&#x27;s WebKit (now Blink), a decision described as a &quot;sad day for the web.&quot;

From 2018 to 2020, Opera was involved in the incubation of Kenyan loan companies OKash and Opesa. In January 2020, the then Opera-owned businesses were accused of offering predatory terms with interest rates of up to 876 percent per annum and employing unethical debt recovery practices such as debt shaming and abusing customer privacy. In August 2020, Opera announced its divestment from majority ownership of its microlending holdings, and in March 2022, Opera sold its stake outright.

<doc id="538496" wikidata="Q573648" url="?curid=538496" title="Robert MacNeil">
<text>Robert Breckenridge Ware MacNeil (January 19, 1931 – April 12, 2024), often known as Robin MacNeil, was a Canadian-American journalist, writer and television news anchor. He partnered with Jim Lehrer to create the landmark public television news program &quot;The Robert MacNeil Report&quot; in 1975. MacNeil co-anchored the program until 1995. The show eventually became the &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot; and is today &quot;PBS News Hour&quot;.

==Early life and education==
MacNeil was born in Montreal on January 19, 1931, the son of Margaret Virginia (née Oxner) and Robert A. S. MacNeil, a Royal Canadian Navy officer in World War II and later a Canadian foreign service officer. He grew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, went to boarding school at Rothesay Collegiate School and Upper Canada College, then attended Dalhousie University and later graduated from Carleton University in Ottawa in 1955.

==Career==
MacNeil began working in the news field at ITV in London, then for Reuters, and then for NBC News as a correspondent in Washington, D.C. He also worked as a news anchor, for WNBC, in New York City.

On November 22, 1963, MacNeil covered President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s visit to Dallas for NBC News. After shots rang out in Dealey Plaza, MacNeil, who was with the presidential motorcade, followed crowds running onto the grassy knoll; he appears in a photo taken just moments after the assassination. As he was reporting for NBC, MacNeil was at times in relatively close proximity to his future co-anchor and partner Jim Lehrer, also covering the Kennedy visit and assassination for the &quot;Dallas Times Herald&quot;, but the two did not meet until several years later, covering the Senate Watergate hearings in Washington, D.C. for PBS.

===News anchor===
In 1967, MacNeil began covering American and European politics for the BBC. From 1971 to 1974, he hosted &quot;Washington Week in Review&quot;, a public affairs television program on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). 

MacNeil rose to fame during his coverage of the 1973 Senate Watergate hearings for PBS, for which he received an Emmy Award. Teamed with Jim Lehrer, the two broadcast and analysed some 250 hours of the hearings in all, sometimes late into the night. This coverage helped lead to and inspire his most famous role, when he joined Lehrer in 1976 to create the PBS daily evening news program &quot;The Robert MacNeil Report&quot;, later renamed &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer Report&quot; and then &quot;The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot;. After serving 20 years on the program, MacNeil retired from his nightly appearances on October 20, 1995; Lehrer anchored the program solo until 2009. The program continues as the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;. He remained involved with the news program until 2013 as one of the heads of MacNeil-Lehrer Productions.

===Other work===
In director Michael Almereyda&#x27;s 2000 modern-day adaptation of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, MacNeil portrayed the Player King, reimagined as a TV news reporter.

After the September 11 attacks, MacNeil called PBS and offered to help. He joined PBS&#x27;s coverage of the attacks and their aftermath, interviewing reporters and giving his thoughts on the events.

In 2007, MacNeil hosted the PBS television miniseries &quot;America at a Crossroads&quot;, which presented independently produced documentaries about the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;. The series initially ran from April 15–20, with further episodes later that year.

In a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Special Report, muppet parody of the Iran-Contra scandal, MacNeil investigated a &quot;Cookiegate&quot; incident involving the Cookie Monster. In 1998, for Season 29&#x27;s &quot;Slimey to the Moon&quot; story arc, MacNeil took the role of co-anchor with Kermit the Frog, as Slimey, Oscar the Grouch&#x27;s pet worm, and four other worms made a landing on the Moon.

MacNeil chaired the MacDowell Colony&#x27;s board of directors from 1993 to 2010. He was succeeded by Michael Chabon.

Inspired by his passion for language, he made the nine-part television series &quot;The Story of English&quot; in 1986 for PBS and the BBC, detailing the development of the English language. &quot;The Story of English&quot; is also a companion book, also produced in 1986. The book and the television series were written by MacNeil, Robert McCrum, and William Cran.

==Personal life and death==
MacNeil became a naturalized American citizen in 1997, and became an Order of Canada officer that same year. He was married to Rosemarie Coopland, Jane Doherty, and Donna Nappi Richards MacNeil. With Coopland, he was the father of award-winning theatre scenic designer Ian MacNeil.

MacNeil was known to friends and family as &quot;Robin&quot;.

MacNeil died of natural causes at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan on April 12, 2024, at the age of 93, confirmed by his daughter Alison MacNeil.

==Awards and honors==

MacNeil also wrote books, many of which are about his career as a journalist. After his retirement from &quot;NewsHour&quot;, he also dabbled in writing novels. His books include:

<text>The Buick Riviera is a personal luxury car that was marketed by Buick from 1963 to 1999, with the exception of the 1994 model year.

As General Motors&#x27; first entry into the personal luxury car market segment, the Riviera was highly praised by automotive journalists upon its high-profile debut. It was a ground-up design on a new GM E platform debuting for the 1963 model year and was also Buick&#x27;s first unique Riviera model.

Unlike its subsequent GM E platform stablemates, the Oldsmobile Toronado and Cadillac Eldorado, the Riviera was initially a front engine/rear-wheel drive platform, switching to front-wheel drive starting with the 1979 model year.

While the early models stayed close to their original form, eight subsequent generations varied substantially in size and styling. A total of 1,127,261 Rivieras were produced.

The Riviera name was resurrected for two concept cars that were displayed at auto shows in 2007 and in 2013.
==Origins==

===The Riviera name===

The name &quot;Riviera&quot;, Italian for &quot;coastline&quot;, was chosen to evoke the allure and affluence of the French Riviera. It first entered the Buick line in 1949, as the designation for the new two-door pillarless hardtop, described in advertising as &quot;stunningly smart&quot;. The Buick Roadmaster Riviera coupe (along with the Cadillac Coupe de Ville and Oldsmobile 98 Holiday coupe) constituted the first mass production use of this body style, which was to become popular over the next 30 years. Buick added a two-door Riviera hardtop to the Super the following year, the Special in 1951, and the Century upon its return, after a 12-year absence, in 1954.

From 1951 to 1953 the &quot;Riviera&quot; designation was given to the existing long-wheelbase versions of the four-door Buick Roadmaster and Super sedans. The 1951–53 Buick Roadmaster and Super four-door Riviera sedans feature more standard features, more plush interior trim, and a wheelbase (and overall length) that is longer than a regular Buick Roadmaster or Super four-door sedan. The 1951–52 Buick Super four-door Riviera sedan is still shorter in wheelbase and length than the regular Buick Roadmaster and shorter than the Roadmaster four-door Riviera sedan. In 1953, with the move from the Fireball straight-eight to the more compact Fireball V8 engine, the Roadmaster and Super four-door Riviera sedans became the same length.

In the middle of the 1955 model year, Buick and Oldsmobile introduced the world&#x27;s first mass-produced four-door hardtops, with Buick offering it only on the Century and Special models, and the &quot;Riviera&quot; designation was also applied to these body styles. Four-door Riviera hardtops were added to the Roadmaster and Super lines at the beginning of the following model year. However, since it was a body style designation and not a model, the Riviera name does not usually appear on the car.

In 1959, Buick became much more selective in applying the Riviera name. From then until 1962 it only was used to denote a premium trimmed six-window hardtop style which it initially shared exclusively with Cadillac (the Oldsmobile 98 would receive it in 1961) and was available only on the Electra 225. The last usage of the term &quot;Riviera&quot; to describe a luxury trim level was 1963, as the formal designation of the #4829 Electra 225 Riviera four-door hardtop, the same year the E-body model two-door hardtop coupe Riviera made its debut.

===Debut as a personal luxury car===
In the late 1950s, GM lacked a personal luxury car to compete with the highly successful Ford Thunderbird—a uniquely styled, two-door that had dramatically increased in popularity when expanded from a two-seater to a four-passenger car and the Chrysler 300C. To fill this gap, an experimental Cadillac design, the XP-715, was created, dubbed the &quot;LaSalle&quot; after a former GM luxury marque. Its angular look was reportedly inspired by GM styling chief Bill Mitchell&#x27;s visit to London during the period, when he was struck by the sight of a custom-bodied Rolls-Royce. He later said that &quot;knife-edged&quot; styling was what he wanted for the new model, but with a lower profile. The design itself was penned by stylist Ned Nickles.

When Cadillac passed on the venture in 1960 the project was thrown open for competition by the other GM Divisions. Buick, desperate to revive its flagging sales, won the competition by enlisting the aid of the McCann-Erickson advertising agency to create its presentation. Initially referred to as the &quot;Buick LaSalle&quot; and later &quot;Buick Riviera&quot; concept cars, the finished design was adapted to a shortened version of Buick&#x27;s existing cruciform frame. It was again introduced as a concept car in 1963 called the Buick Riviera Silver Arrow.

Of the first generation Riviera, 112,544 units were produced in three years, divided into exactly 40,000 vehicles in the 1963 model year, as well as 37,658 for 1964 and the last model year 1965 with 34,586 vehicles.

==First generation (1963–1965)==


The production Riviera was introduced on October 4, 1962, as a 1963 model, its distinctive bodyshell was unique to the marque, unusual for a GM product. The design was substantially the same as the original, less expensively hidden headlights concealed in the fender grilles. The elegant ground-up styling sported the new &quot;Coke bottle look&quot; introduced the year before on the arresting Studebaker Avanti, with a tapered midsection surrounded by flaring fenders. There was no trace of the &quot;Sweepspear&quot; used on beltlines of earlier Buicks with the Riviera package.

It rode a cruciform frame similar to the standard Buick chassis, but shorter and narrower, with a narrower track. Its wheelbase of and overall length of were and shorter, respectively, than a Buick LeSabre, but slightly longer than a contemporary Thunderbird. At , it was about lighter than either. It shared the standard Buick V8 engines, with a displacement of either or , and the unique continuously variable design twin turbine automatic transmission. Power brakes were standard, using Buick&#x27;s massive &quot;Al-Fin&quot; (aluminum finned) drums of diameter. Power steering was standard equipment, with an overall steering ratio of 20.5:1, giving 3.5 turns lock-to-lock.

The Riviera&#x27;s suspension used Buick&#x27;s standard design, with double wishbones in the front and a live axle located by trailing arms and a lateral track bar in the rear, but the roll centers were lowered to reduce body lean. Although its coil springs were actually slightly softer than other Buicks, the Riviera&#x27;s lighter weight made its ride somewhat firmer. While still biased towards understeer, contemporary testers considered it one of the most driveable American cars, with an excellent balance of comfort and agility.

Buick&#x27;s &quot;Nailhead&quot; V-8 was initially the only available engine, fitted with dual exhaust as standard equipment, and the turbine drive the only transmission. Base price was $4,333 ($ in dollars ), running upwards of $5,000 delivered with typical options ($ in dollars ). Buick announced an optional version of the Nailhead in December 1962. Total production was deliberately limited to 40,000 vehicles (in a year that Buick sold 440,000 units overall) to emphasize the Riviera&#x27;s exclusivity and to increase demand; only 2,601 were delivered with the delayed availability larger engine in the 1963 model year.

With the same power as the bigger Buicks and less weight, the Riviera had improved all-around performance: &quot;Motor Trend&quot; recorded in 8 seconds or less, the standing in about 16 seconds, and an observed top speed of . Fuel economy was . Front leg room was .

Inside, the Riviera featured a luxurious four-place cabin with front bucket seats and bucket-style seats in the rear. A center console with a floor shifter and storage compartment built into the instrument panel divided the front. Upholstery choices included all-vinyl, cloth and vinyl, or optional leather. A deluxe interior option included real walnut inserts on the doors and below the rear side windows. Extra-cost options included a tilt steering wheel, power windows, power driver&#x27;s seat, air conditioning, a remote-controlled side-view mirror, and white sidewall tires.

Minimal trim and mechanical changes were made for 1964, with the most identifiable distinguishing features being a raised stylized &quot;R&quot; hood emblem and &quot;R&quot; emblems replacing the Buick crests in the taillight lenses. The interior is distinguished by moving the heater controls from controls under the dashboard eyebrow to slide controls in the forward fairing of the center console. Leather was dropped as an option, and the Dynaflow twin-turbine transmission was replaced by a new three-speed Super Turbine 400. This was a GM Turbo Hydra-Matic. It used a two-speed &quot;D&quot; and &#x27;L&quot; selector, but could automatically downshift from third to second until the car reached a suitable speed to downshift to first. This was the first year of the stylized &quot;R&quot; emblem, a trademark that would continue throughout the remainder of Riviera&#x27;s 36-year production run. The engine was upgraded to the previously optional V8. A &#x27;Super Wildcat&#x27; version was available, with dual Carter AFB four-barrel carburetors.
In 1965 the V8 returned as the standard engine, and the &quot;Gran Sport&quot; version made its debut, powered by the Super Wildcat V8, a engine equipped with two Carter 625 CFM carburetors, a distributor with different advance, and outfitted with a more aggressive 3.42 axle ratio. A heavy-duty suspension was the separate H2 option but was not part of the Gran Sport option. It offered a quicker ratio steering box and firmer rated springs. The Super Turbine 400 transmission now had a variable pitch torque converter, but was fitted with a three-speed gear selector. The Gran Sport stock dual exhaust pipes were increased from to inside diameter and had fewer turns to reduce backpressure. Externally, the headlamps, now vertically arranged, were hidden behind clamshell doors in the leading edges of each fender, as had been in the original design. The non-functional side scoops between the doors and rear wheel arches were removed, and the taillights moved from the body into the rear bumper. A vinyl roof became available as an option, offered only in black, and the tilt steering wheel, optional in previous years, was now standard equipment.

Total sales for the 1963 through 1965 model years was 112,244. The Riviera was well received by the motoring press and considered a great success, giving the Thunderbird its first real competition as America&#x27;s preeminent personal luxury car.

It has since earned Milestone status from the Milestone Car Society. Jaguar founder and designer Sir William Lyons remarked that Mitchell had done &quot;a very wonderful job,&quot; and Sergio Pininfarina declared it &quot;one of the most beautiful American cars ever built; it has marked a very impressive return to simplicity of American car design.&quot; At its debut at the Paris Auto Show, Raymond Loewy said the Riviera was the most handsome American production car—apart from his own Studebaker Avanti, in his view the Riviera&#x27;s only real competition for 1963. The first-generation Riviera is considered a styling landmark and has become a collectible car.

==Second generation (1966–1970)==



The Riviera was redesigned for the 1966 model year. It retained its cruciform X-frame, powertrain, and brakes, but its new body was longer, wider, and heavier. Vent windows, a feature GM had introduced in the 1930s, were absent. Headlamps remained concealed, but now pivoted behind the grille when not in use, and they were once again horizontal. The car&#x27;s added weight slowed acceleration with the unchanged 425 engine. The Gran Sport package remained available as an option. Rear seat belts and AM/FM radio were optional.

The new front-wheel drive Oldsmobile Toronado shared the Riviera platform, and, a year later, the also front-wheel drive Cadillac Eldorado — the Riviera retaining the rear-wheel drive layout.

Inside, the four-place cabin with front and rear bucket seats and center console were replaced by a choice of bucket seats or conventional bench seats as standard equipment, making the Riviera a full six-passenger car for the first time. Optionally available was a Strato-bench seat with armrest or Strato bucket seats with either a short console or a full-length operating console with a horseshoe-shaped floor shifter and storage compartment. Both the buckets and Strato-bench seat were available with a reclining seat option for the passenger&#x27;s side. Sales for 1966 rebounded to 45,308, a new record.

For 1967, Buick replaced the 425 &quot;Nailhead&quot; with a V8. Its and of torque were a performance improvement. Gasoline mileage improved slightly, but remained low. Powerful disc brakes with Bendix four-piston calipers became optional for the front wheels but most Riviera continued to be ordered with Buick&#x27;s highly capable ribbed aluminum brake drums. Cosmetically, changes were few and were limited to the addition of a wide, full-width, center-mounted horizontal chrome grille bar that stretched over the headlight doors and outboard parking lights. Sales were 42,799 for the 1967 model year. The Riviera had full instrumentation.

1967 saw the introduction of U.S. mandated safety equipment to improve occupant crash protection, including an energy-absorbing steering column, non-protruding control knobs, 4-way hazard flasher, soft interior surfaces, locking seatbacks (on 2-door models), a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system (with warning light), and shoulder belt anchors. 

1968 models had reshaped loop-type bumpers that surrounded both the vehicle&#x27;s recessed crosshatch front grille and tail lamps. Hidden wiper arms debuted. Federally mandated side marker lights appeared, as inverted trapezoids on the lower leading edges of the front fenders, and circular in the rear. The interior was restyled and for the first time shared its instrument panel with the other full-size Buick models. Shoulder belts for front outboard occupants were made standard on all cars built from January 1, 1968. Mechanically, the transmission lost its variable pitch torque converter. A tilt steering wheel was standard. Sales set another new record in 1968, as 49,284 units were sold.

For the 1969 model year, grilles gained a pattern of fine vertical bars overlaid by two wider horizontal bars. Front marker lights became far shorter and square. Front outboard headrests were revised. The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column and locked the steering wheel and selector lever when the key was removed (a security feature that became mandatory for the 1970 model year). Chrome side trim was revised, as well. At the rear, the reverse lights moved from the rear bumper to new three-section tail-light lenses. Sales for 1969 were 52,872.

The 1970 Riviera was restyled, incorporating design cues from Bill Mitchell&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Silver Arrow II&quot; concept car. Exposed quad headlamps were nearly flush-mounted, while the new front bumper wrapped around and over the new vertical bar grille. A pronounced side trim and skirted rear wheels were standard, with optional exposed wheels. The rear used revised bumper and taillights. The engine was upgraded to , the largest engine Buick offered to date, rated at gross, net, and over of torque. 1970 sales were 37,366, the second-generation Riviera proved more successful than the first, with 227,669 units sold over five the years.

==Third generation (1971–1973)==


The Riviera was radically redesigned for the 1971 model year with flowing and dramatic &quot;boat-tail&quot; styling. Designed under Bill Mitchell&#x27;s direction, it was penned by Jerry Hirshberg, future head of design for Nissan, mating the two-piece vee-butted fastback rear window, inspired by the 1963 Corvette Sting Ray coupe, to the Riviera&#x27;s platform.

The design was originally intended for the smaller A-body or its related G-body, as shown by a full scale clay model of an A-body based boat-tail Riviera recently revealed. Given the late stage of the 1968-72 A/G platform evolution and accretive cost to add another version to it, GM Management decreed that the next Riviera use the full sized GM B platform body—expanded for 1971 by in wheelbase and more than heavier— which produced controversial looks, making for a sharp departure from those of the Toronado and Eldorado. (&quot;Collectible Automobile&quot; ran an article about 1971–76 full-sized Buicks in which one sketch design for their 2-door coupes which was rejected resembled the 1971–73 Riviera).

This generation introduced a much more visual representation of the &quot;sweepspear&quot;, with a more faithful representation to the version that appeared on 1950s Buicks in both the side molding and beltline. Large, round wheel openings were intended to convey more of a sporty air. The only engine available was Buick&#x27;s own 455 ci V8 engine producing , with with the Gran Sport (GS) package.

The 455 engine had a lower compression ratio to meet EPA emissions requirements, together with the shift from SAE gross to SAE net ratings this reduced claimed power to , with in the Gran Sport. Performance remained reasonably brisk, with a 0–60 mph time of 8.1 seconds for the GS, but the Riviera&#x27;s sporty image was rapidly fading. One noteworthy advance was Buick&#x27;s Max Trac traction control. The 1971 Riviera also features GM&#x27;s &quot;Full-Flo&quot; ventilation system and two large deck lid louvers are prominent on the trunk lid.

Despite these features, Riviera sales for 1971 dropped to 33,810, the lowest to date. The 1972 Riviera received a new, egg-crate grille, more substantial front bumpers to prepare for the new 5-mph impact legislation, restyled taillight trim, and the louvers were removed from the trunk lid. The 1972 Riviera also featured a redesigned ventilation system, and the 455 engine switched to net power ratings, or in the Gran Sport, although the actual drop in net power was only . Sales remained stagnant at 33,728, a drop of 82 from the prior year.

For 1973, the Riviera underwent a number of changes. The front bumper was redesigned to be thicker and featured bumper guards as standard in order to meet 1974 impact-bumper standards, the grille was switched back to horizontal slats, and the front lamps were moved from the bumper and were now integrated into the headlights, wrapping around the corners of the car. Sluggish sales of the third generation Riviera led GM to believe that the boattail deck lid was too radical for most customers&#x27; tastes, so in 1973 it was blunted and made slightly shorter. The taillights, meanwhile, were moved down from the sheet metal and into the bumper, and the rear license plate location was moved from the left side of the bumper to the center. The engine became standard, with with the Stage One package. This also included a limited-slip differential and a chrome-plated air cleaner. The &quot;Gran Sport&quot; package was still available as a separate option package consisting of a ride-and-handling package that included a rear stabilizer bar, JR78-15 whitewall steel-belted radial tires, a specially tuned &quot;radial roadability&quot; suspension, additional sound insulation and special &quot;Gran Sport&quot; badging. The design changes however only led to a marginal increase in sales, with 34,080 being produced for the model year.

==Fourth generation (1974–1976)==
Although carrying over the same platform, mechanicals, and some body panels seen on the &quot;Third Generation&quot; Riviera, Buick replaced its distinctive &#x27;boat tail&#x27; roofline with a more conventional-looking &quot;Colonnade&quot; treatment which was more in line with its LeSabre and Electra brethren than its front-wheel drive cousins. This turned the car from a hardtop coupe into a pillared coupe, as it featured wide B pillars and fixed quarter opera windows. A landau half-vinyl roof option was available. The car did retain its forward-jutting grille, albeit in a slightly modified form. Thus modified, the car looked far less distinctive than its predecessors, and even its platform mates, the Oldsmobile Toronado and Cadillac Eldorado.

The tamer-looking Riviera was no lighter, and its standard 455 V8 lost more power, dropping to and for standard and Stage One models respectively. Max Trac was dropped from the option list after 1974 due to a lack of buyer interest. The revised styling did not improve sales, which fell to 20,129 in 1974, although it is impossible to determine how much this was a result of the energy crisis and how much was due to the tame appearance. This generation introduced a novelty that later became federally mandated in a modified form, two high-mounted taillights above the trunk and below the rear window, which was shared on its platform twin the Toronado.

For 1975, the Riviera received an updated front fascia, which lost its forward-jutting theme through the redesign of the fiberglass front end cap. Quad rectangular headlights were mounted horizontally. The new vertical-bar grille echoed the &quot;stand-up&quot; theme that many GM cars of the day incorporated. Parking lights wrapped around the fender sides. The Stage One performance package was dropped for 1975, though the Gran Sport handling package would continue to be offered. The standard engine&#x27;s output dipped to . Sales for 1975 were 17,306.

Minor changes greeted 1976 models, the most notable of which was a new crosshatch grille insert. The Gran Sport handling package was replaced by an &#x27;S/R&#x27; package that had similar sporting pretensions. Sales rallied slightly to 20,082 for 1976.

==Fifth generation (1977–1978)==
Buick downsized the Riviera for 1977 onto the new smaller GM B platform. While the other E-bodies were front wheel drive since 1966 (1967 for Cadillac&#x27;s Eldorado), the Buick E platform used a rear-wheel-drive B-body undercarriage (along with the cruciform frame of pre-1965 GMs for the 1966–70 generation). All B-bodies (including C and D platform GM RWDs) were downsized for the 1977 model year which prompted the short-lived 1977/78 generation.

It was, in most respects, a Buick LeSabre coupe with unique styling (with quarter windows mimicking the 1975–78 Cadillac Eldorado). Unlike its LeSabre counterpart, the front fascia is vertical as opposed to slanted. It was reduced to a wheelbase of , down , and an overall length of , down . Weight was reduced by approximately . The 455 engine was replaced by a Buick V8 engine with or an Oldsmobile-built with . California models had a Oldsmobile 350.

Sales were up modestly to 26,138 for 1977 and then fell to 20,535 for 1978, although this was a stopgap model until the all-new E-body cars would be ready for 1979. The 1977 and 1978 Rivieras were produced on the downsized GM B platform before the 1979 redesign on the FWD E-platform.

===75th Anniversary Package===
For 1978, a special &quot;LXXV&quot; edition was released to commemorate Buick&#x27;s 75th anniversary on the market. Production total was 2,889 and included special silver &amp; black paint with gray leather seats with black trim, four-wheel disc brakes, brushed chrome trim, deep pile carpeting, and special LXXV name plates.

==Sixth generation (1979–1985)==

The 1979 model year was the debut of the first front wheel drive Riviera, which was also the first front-drive production model in Buick history. Built on a wheelbase, it once again shared its mechanical design and platform with the Cadillac Eldorado and Oldsmobile Toronado. The Olds 403 and Buick 350 were dropped, but the Olds 350 remained, as did a new turbocharged Buick V6 engine of displacement with which was installed in the Riviera S-Type, shared with the Regal Sport Coupe turbo for model year 1980. The Riviera became &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Car of the Year. Sales more than doubled, to 52,181 for 1979 and 48,621 for the similar 1980 models.

1981 saw the Turbo renamed T-Type and the demise of the 350 engine in favor of the Oldsmobile-built with (phased in during the 1980 MY). The standard engine was now Buick&#x27;s V6, and a new option was an Oldsmobile diesel engine with a mere offered through 1985. 1982 also saw the first-ever Riviera convertible, although relatively few were built, owing to a high price - US$23,944 ($ in dollars ). The Riviera convertible was available in only two color choices-white or red firemist with the only interior color of red leather. A twin-turbocharged Riviera convertible was chosen to be the pace car at the 1983 Indianapolis 500, tuned to produce . Most convertible Rivieras had the V8 engine, which saw an increase in rated SAE net HP to 150 for both convertibles and coupes fitted with it from 1982 through the 1985 model year.

In 1983 a special edition of 500 &quot;Riviera XX&quot; was offered, celebrating twenty years since the introduction of the first Riviera (502 were built in the end). These have a special two-tone exterior paint, real wire wheels, a leather, and walnut interior as well as 24-karat gold plated &quot;Riviera XX&quot; badging. The Riviera XX also received a special grille, which then became part of the 1984 model year facelift model. Overall sales made the 1980s Riviera a great success, reaching 65,305 for the 1985 model year.

==Seventh generation (1986–1993)==

The E-body coupes were converted to unibody construction and transverse front-wheel drive — and was further downsized for 1986, to a wheelbase. The V6 was now the only engine, fitted with sequential fuel injection (SFI) and was rated initially at SAE (LG2) and of torque. It used the Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4 automatic transmission with a 2.84:1 final drive ratio. The 3.8 was the only engined used for the seventh generation Riviera, although its power climbed incrementally over the years. For 1987, the engine was changed to the LG3 with roller lifters rather than flat lifters, power increased to SAE while the torque remained unchanged. This was replaced by the LN3, with power and torque up to and respectively thanks to multi-port fuel injection, balance shafts, and other improvements. The LN3 was used from 1988 until 1990. For the last three model years Buick used the L27 iteration with sequential, tuned port fuel injection (TPI), which gained a few more horsepower and more mid-range torque from a new, two-piece intake manifold with longer runners. Power crept up to at 4,800 rpm, torque was up to at 3,200 rpm.

This generation featured the &quot;Graphic Control Center&quot; (GCC), an advanced electronic instrumentation system which employed a dash-mounted monochrome touchscreen CRT display. The GCC controlled the vehicle&#x27;s climate control system and stereo, and also supplied advanced instrumentation such as a trip computer, vehicle diagnostics, and a maintenance reminder feature. Four-wheel disc brakes were standard. With a choice of three suspension packages available, up to the performance-oriented FE3 setting, handling was notably improved. The Riviera placed fourth for &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s 1986 Car of the Year contest. 

The seventh generation Riviera saw the installation of Dynaride, which was an air compressor that would pressurize the rear Chapman struts to maintain a level overall ride height. A badge was installed on the dashboard to the left of the steering column on all vehicles equipped. It was not available on vehicles equipped with Gran Touring Suspension.

Fuel economy was notably improved for the 1986 Riviera. Prices increase to $19,831 ($ in dollars) for the base model and $21,577 for the T-Type ($ in dollars). Sales declined to 22,138 for 1986, 15,223 for 1987, and 8,625 for 1988. 1988 also saw the introduction of Buick&#x27;s Reatta coupe, a two-seat personal luxury car.

The Riviera was restyled for 1989, adding to the overall length (on an unchanged wheelbase). Sales rose to 21,189 for 1989, but dropped to a low of 4,555 for 1993, the abbreviated final model year of this generation. The last, 1993 Riviera was manufactured at the Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant on December 10, 1992.


==Eighth generation (1995–1999)==
After a hiatus in 1994, the Riviera returned in 1995 with a complete redesign. A naturally aspirated 3800 V6 was standard, with an optional supercharged 3800 V6 rated at and . Rivieras were now manufactured in Orion Township, Michigan, using the same Cadillac-derived G platform as the 4-door Oldsmobile Aurora. The first of 41,422 1995 Rivieras was manufactured on May 23, 1994.

In 1996, the supercharged engine&#x27;s output increased to and , and it was now paired with a 4T60E-HD transmission. 18,036 Rivieras were manufactured in 1996.

For model year (MY) 1997, engineers revised the suspension revisions, removing weight. An upgraded 4T65E-HD transmission featuring a larger torque converter and heavy-duty gearbox were added. 18,827 were made in 1997.

For 1998, the supercharged V6 became standard. GM&#x27;s OnStar service was added as an option, along with minor interior design changes and features including new passenger heated seats and the removal of the front &quot;55/45&quot; 3-seater split bench option. A total of 10,953 units were produced for 1998.

With sales of all coupes declining in the North American market, GM discontinued the Riviera. 1999 was the car&#x27;s last model year with production of 1,956 cars ending on November 25, 1998. The final 200 cars had special silver paint and trim, and were denoted &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; models, referring to several &quot;Silver Arrow&quot; concept cars built off the earliest Riviera by Bill Mitchell.

Eighth-generation Rivieras received the most powerful V6 Buick engine since the Grand Nationals of the 1980s. The supercharged OHV V6 provided high torque and acceleration allowing in under 7 seconds, and turning the standing in 15.5 seconds. Supercharged Rivieras achieved a fuel efficiency figure of / (city/highway).

<text>Artabanus ( &quot;Artabanos&quot;; &quot;Ardawān&quot;) may refer to various rulers/monarchs of ancient Persia and Parthia:

* Artabanus (son of Hystaspes), brother of Darius I and uncle of Xerxes I
* Artabanus of Persia, Hyrcanian by birth, commander of Xerxes&#x27;s guard, and Xerxes&#x27;s assassin (465 BC)
* Artapanus (general), general under Xerxes I (486–465 BC)
* Artabanus I of Parthia, c. 127–124 BC
* Artabanus II of Parthia, c. 12 to 38/41 AD
* Artabanus III of Parthia, 79/80 – 81
* Artabanus IV of Parthia, c. 213 to 224
* Artabanus of Khwarazm, c.1st-2nd century AD

Confusingly, two systems exist for the regnal numbers of the Artabanuses; in older works, they may be numbered as a regnal number higher than listed above; i.e. Artabanus IV might refer to Artabanus III.

The Mandaic variant of the name is Ardban (also Ardwan).

<doc id="538532" wikidata="Q3434574" url="?curid=538532" title="Lineweaver–Burk plot">
<text>In biochemistry, the Lineweaver–Burk plot (or double reciprocal plot) is a graphical representation of the Michaelis–Menten equation of enzyme kinetics, described by Hans Lineweaver and Dean Burk in 1934.

The double reciprocal plot distorts the error structure of the data, and is therefore not the most accurate tool for the determination of enzyme kinetic parameters. While the Lineweaver–Burk plot has historically been used for evaluation of the parameters, together with the alternative linear forms of the Michaelis–Menten equation such as the Hanes–Woolf plot or Eadie–Hofstee plot, all linearized forms of the Michaelis–Menten equation should be avoided to calculate the kinetic parameters. Properly weighted non-linear regression methods are significantly more accurate and have become generally accessible with the universal availability of desktop computers.

== Definitions ==
The Lineweaver–Burk plot derives from a transformation of the Michaelis–Menten equation,

:formula_1 

in which the rate formula_2 is a function of the substrate concentration formula_3 and two parameters formula_4, the limiting rate, and formula_5, the Michaelis constant. Taking reciprocals of both sides of this equation it becomes as follows:

:formula_6 

Thus plotting formula_7 against formula_8 generates a straight line with ordinate intercept formula_9, abscissa intercept formula_10 and slope formula_11.

==Applications==

When used for determining the type of enzyme inhibition, the Lineweaver–Burk plot can distinguish between competitive, pure non-competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors. The various modes of inhibition can be compared to the uninhibited reaction.

=== Competitive inhibition ===
The apparent value of formula_4 is unaffected by competitive inhibitors. Therefore competitive inhibitors have the same intercept on the ordinate as uninhibited enzymes.

Competitive inhibition increases the apparent value of formula_5, or lowers substrate affinity. Graphically this can be seen as the inhibited enzyme having a larger intercept on the abscissa.

=== Pure non-competitive inhibition ===
With pure noncompetitive inhibition the apparent value of formula_4 is decreased. This can be seen on the Lineweaver–Burk plot as an increased ordinate intercept with no effect on the abscissa intercept formula_10, as pure noncompetitive inhibition does not effect substrate affinity.

=== Mixed inhibition ===
Pure noncompetitive inhibition is rare, and mixed inhibition is much more common. In mixed inhibition the apparent value of formula_4 is decreased, and that of formula_5 is changed—usually increased, meaning that the affinity usually decreases with mixed inhibition.

Cleland recognized that pure noncompetitive inhibition was very rare in practice, occurring mainly with effects of protons and some metal ions, and he redefined &quot;noncompetitive&quot; to mean &quot;mixed&quot;. Many authors have followed him in this respect, but not all.

=== Uncompetitive inhibition ===
The apparent value of formula_4 decreases with uncompetitive inhibition, with that of formula_19. This can be seen on the Lineweaver–Burk plot as an increased intercept on the ordinate with no change in slope.

Substrate affinity increases with uncompetitive inhibition, or lowers the apparent value of formula_5. Graphically uncompetitive inhibition can be identified in the plot parallel lines for the different concentrations of inhibitor..

== Shortcomings ==

The Lineweaver–Burk plot does a poor job of visualizing experimental error. Specifically, if the errors formula_21 have uniform standard errors, then those of formula_7 vary over a very wide range, as can be seen from the following example:

: If formula_23 then the range of formula_7 is 0.91–1.11, approximately 20%
: If formula_25 (same standard deviation) then the range of formula_7 is 0.0990–0.1001, approximately 1%.

Lineweaver and Burk were aware of this problem, and after investigating the error distribution experimentally, finding a uniform standard deviation in formula_2, they consulted the eminent statistician W. Edwards Deming. In the light of his advice they used weights of formula_28 for fitting their formula_7. This aspect of their paper has been almost universally ignored by people who refer to the &quot;method of Lineweaver and Burk.&quot;

The values measured at low formula_3, and hence large values of formula_8 lead to points on the far right of the plot and have a large effect on the slope of the line, and thus in particular on the value of formula_5.

<doc id="538538" wikidata="Q692343" url="?curid=538538" title="Praetorian prefect">
<text>The praetorian prefect (; ) was a high office in the Roman Empire. Originating as the commander of the Praetorian Guard, the office gradually acquired extensive legal and administrative functions, with its holders becoming the Emperor&#x27;s chief aides. Under Constantine I, the office was much reduced in power and transformed into a purely civilian administrative post, while under his successors, territorially-defined praetorian prefectures emerged as the highest-level administrative division of the Empire. The prefects again functioned as the chief ministers of the state, with many laws addressed to them by name. In this role, praetorian prefects continued to be appointed by the Eastern Roman Empire (and the Ostrogothic Kingdom) until the reign of Heraclius in the 7th century AD, when wide-ranging reforms reduced their power and converted them to mere overseers of provincial administration. The last traces of the prefecture disappeared in the Byzantine Empire by the 840s.

The term &quot;praefectus praetorio&quot; was often abbreviated in inscriptions as &quot;PR PR&quot; or &quot;PPO&quot;.

== History ==

=== Commander of the Praetorian Guard ===
Under the empire the praetorians or imperial guards were commanded by one, two, or even three praefects (praefecti praetorio), who were chosen by the emperor from among the equites and held office at his pleasure. From the time of Alexander Severus the post was open to senators also, and if an equestrian was appointed he was at the same time raised to the senate. Down to the time of Constantine, who deprived the office of its military character, the prefecture of the guards was regularly held by tried soldiers, often by men who had fought their way up from the ranks. In course of time the command seems to have been enlarged so as to include all the troops in Italy except the corps commanded by the city praefect (&quot;cohortes urbanae&quot;).

The special position of the praetorians made them a power in their own right in the Roman state, and their prefect, the &quot;praefectus praetorio&quot;, soon became one of the more powerful men in this society. The emperors tried to flatter and control the praetorians, but they staged many coups d&#x27;état and contributed to a rapid rate of turnover in the imperial succession. The praetorians thus came to destabilize the Roman state, contrary to their purpose. The praetorian prefect became a major administrative figure in the later empire, when the post combined in one individual the duties of an imperial chief of staff with direct command over the guard also. Diocletian greatly reduced the power of these prefects as part of his sweeping reform of the empire&#x27;s administrative and military structures.

=== Transformation to administrator ===
In addition to his military functions, the praetorian prefect came to acquire jurisdiction over criminal affairs, which he exercised not as the delegate but as the representative of the emperor. By the time of Diocletian he had become a kind of grand-vizier as the emperor&#x27;s vice-regent and &#x27;prime minister.&#x27; Constantine removed active military command in 312. The prefect remained as chief quarter-master general responsible for the logistical supply of the army. The prefect was the chief financial officer whose office drew up the global imperial budget. His office drew up the state liturgical obligations laid on the richer inhabitants of the Empire. He ceased to be head of administration which had to be shared with the master of the offices attached to the palace. Constantine in 331 confirmed that from the sentence of the praetorian praefect there should be no appeal. A similar jurisdiction in civil cases was acquired by him not later than the time of Septimius Severus. Hence a knowledge of law became a qualification for the post, which under Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, but especially from the time of Severus, was held by the first jurists of the age, (e.g. Papinian, Ulpian, Paulus) and, under Justinianus, John the Cappadocian, while the military qualification fell more and more into the background.

The tetrarchy reform of Diocletian () multiplied the office: there was a praetorian prefect as chief of staff (military and administrative)—rather than commander of the guard—for each of the two Augusti, but not for the two Caesars. Each praetorian prefect oversaw one of the four quarters created by Diocletian, which became regional praetorian prefectures for the young sons of Constantine ca 330 A.D. From 395 there were two imperial courts, at Rome (later Ravenna) and Constantinople, but the four prefectures remained as the highest level of administrative division, in charge of several dioceses (groups of Roman provinces), each of which was headed by a Vicarius.
Under Constantine I, the institution of the magister militum deprived the praetorian prefecture altogether of its military character but left it the highest civil office of the empire.

=== Post-imperial era ===
With the fall of the western part of the Empire into the hands of warlords, these, in order to have support in their new domains, recognized the supremacy of the emperor of the eastern part, reuniting at least &quot;de iure&quot; the Empire under him, the prefectures were maintained as a way of delimiting the new viceroyalties:

* First Flavius Odoacer and later Flavius Theodoricus were granted the prefecture of Italy;
* Louis I was recognized as the prefect of Gaul (which served him as a pretext to seize the Visigoths&#x27; territories in Gaul);
* the Visigoths were recognized for their dominion over the prefecture of Hispania;
* and the Vandals theirs over Africa.

This recognition would be maintained until the rise of Justinian I, who ended the Ostrogothic and Vandal domains, but continued to recognize the Franks (as they were both Catholics) and the Visigoths (due to the lack of strength to continue the &quot;Recuperatio Imperii&quot;, but managing to establish a pro-Byzantine king, Athanagild, and the conquest of Spania).

== List of known prefects of the Praetorian Guard ==
The following is a list of all known prefects of the Praetorian Guard, from the establishment of the post in 2 BC by Augustus until the abolishment of the Guard in 314. The list is presumed to be incomplete due to the lack of sources documenting the exact number of persons who held the post, what their names were and what the length of their tenure was. Likewise, the Praetorians were sometimes commanded by a single prefect, as was the case with for example Sejanus or Burrus, but more often the emperor appointed two commanders, who shared joint leadership. Overlapping terms on the list indicate dual command.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Seven Clocks&quot; is a Sherlock Holmes story by Adrian Conan Doyle (the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator) and John Dickson Carr. The story was published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Life&quot; on 29 December 1952, with illustrations by Adolf Hallman.

== Plot ==
Holmes is consulted by a young lady, a companion to an older woman, about the eccentric behavior of a young man she has met. He behaves normally, but becomes a raging maniac whenever he encounters a clock. The young woman personally has seen him smash two clocks and heard from the man&#x27;s servant of five other incidents. Holmes must travel to a distant seaport to gather information to resolve a horrible, terrorist scheme and solve the mystery of the aberrant behavior.

<doc id="538543" wikidata="Q715673" url="?curid=538543" title="THSR 700T">
<text>The THSR 700T () is the high-speed electric multiple unit trainset derived from the Japanese Shinkansen family for Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR), Taiwan&#x27;s high-speed rail line. The THSR 700T is based primarily on the 700 Series Shinkansen that currently operates on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen line and previously on the Tokaido Shinkansen line in Japan, with the &quot;T&quot; referring to Taiwan. The trains were manufactured in Japan by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Nippon Sharyo, and Hitachi, Ltd., marking the first time Japanese Shinkansen trains have been exported overseas. 30 trains were delivered to THSR operator Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC), and are in regular service with a top speed of since the line&#x27;s opening on January 5, 2007.

== History ==
Taiwan&#x27;s Bureau of High Speed Rail (BOHSR) started to tender THSR as a build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme in October 1996. The two competitors were the Taiwan High Speed Rail Consortium (THSRC) and the Chunghwa High Speed Rail Consortium (CHSRC). THSRC&#x27;s bid was based on the high-speed technology platform of Eurotrain, a joint venture of GEC-Alsthom, the main maker of the French TGV, and Siemens, the main maker of the German ICE. CHSRC&#x27;s bid was based on Japanese Shinkansen technology supplied by Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC), a joint venture of Japanese companies. THSRC was named preferred bidder in September 1997, then, after being reconstituted as the Taiwan High Speed Rail &quot;Corporation&quot; (THSRC), it signed the BOT agreement with BOHSR on July 23, 1998. Following an offer from the Japanese government to provide cheap loans to THSRC if it switches to Shinkansen technology, in spite of an earlier agreement with Eurotrain, THSRC decided to re-tender the core systems technology contract June 1999. THSRC announced on December 28, 1999, that it would negotiate a final contract with TSC. The contract, which included the supply of rolling stock, was signed on December 12, 2000. The controversial award was challenged by Eurotrain in courts without success, but a later lawsuit for payment of damages was successful.

While TSC&#x27;s original offer in CHSRC&#x27;s 1997 bid for the BOT franchise was based on the 500 Series Shinkansen, its bid for THSRC&#x27;s 1999 tender was based on the newer 700 Series Shinkansen. THSRC maintained its European specifications, so the trains had to be designed for and commissioned according to European specifications.

On January 30, 2004, a roll-out ceremony was conducted at Kawasaki Heavy Industries&#x27; Hyogo Works. The first train was shipped to Taiwan in May 2004. Running tests started on the THSR high speed line on January 27, 2005, after four months of delays, on the Tainan–Kaohsiung section. During the tests, a national speed record of was achieved on October 30, 2005. All 30 trains were delivered to Taiwan by 2006. Commercial operation of the 700T began on January 5, 2007, at a maximum operating speed of .

In November 2008 THSRC announced that it was considering ordering an additional six to twelve trains from the Japanese makers for service starting in 2011, in order to cope with increased demand that was expected by that time. In May 2012, an order was placed with Kawasaki Heavy Industries (structural and mechanical parts) and Toshiba (electrical and electromechanical parts) for four 12 car trains at an estimated cost of 19 billion Japanese yen. The trains were delivered between December 2012 and 2015, with options for extra sets.

== Technical details ==
The THSR 700T series is based on the 700 Series Shinkansen operated by JR Central and JR West on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen and San&#x27;yō Shinkansen in Japan. However, more powerful motors and eddy current brakes on trailers provide for a higher top speed. Also for operation, a number of features were derived from the 500 Series Shinkansen, such as the bogies, and the T-shaped and aerodynamically optimised pantographs for reduced noise emission atop cars 4 and 9. The D-ATC (Digital Automatic Train Control) system was in turn derived from that of the 800 Series Shinkansen. Like the 700 Series Shinkansen, a 700T trainset is made of 4-car sub-sets, each with three motor cars and one trailer, albeit a full train is a 12-car set, rather than a 16-car, or 8-car set.

Due to the European safety requirements adapted by THSRC, the trains were equipped with a number of additional safety features compared to Shinkansen trains in Japan. The ATC system was augmented with cruise control and station stopping control and was also made suitable for bi-directional operation, and there is a driver vigilance device. Bogies were fitted with an instability detection system, and pantographs with a system that automatically lowers the rear pantograph if it detects a failure of the leading pantograph. The trains were built with shock absorbing elements for protection in low-speed collisions and were equipped with a parking brake. For enhanced fire safety, fireproof and smokeproof materials were selected for the interior, which was configured with fire barriers, and the trains were equipped with fire and smoke detectors and a battery supplied emergency ventilation system. Passenger doors can be operated from any car, not just from the driver&#x27;s cab, and are equipped with an obstacle detection system that can abort the closing of the door. In addition, the train is equipped with emergency escape windows, which can be broken with hammers for use as emergency exits. The pantograph can be operated by remote control.

Additional changes were made to the HVAC systems to account for Taiwan&#x27;s warmer climates, such as higher strength and wear specifications of certain components, and a more powerful air conditioning system. As with other Shinkansen types, both end cars are trailers and braking power is reduced on the end cars, to avoid slip on powered bogies.
Rather than using Japanese tunnel specifications, THSR tunnels used European specifications, with diameters larger than those in Japan. The nose of the trains was aerodynamically optimised for the different tunnel cross-section, which allowed for a shorter, long nose. The shorter nose, and the lack of a sliding window and an extra door for the driver provided for more space for passengers.

All cars feature single passenger rooms with 2+3 or 2+2 seating, as on the 700 Series Shinkansen. Toilets were installed on odd numbered cars. One end of car 7 features four wheelchair accessible seats, also provide for the fastening of wheelchairs, and there are two foldable wheelchairs. The toilet next to the handicapped area was built to be accessible by wheelchair, with automatic sliding doors, wider space to allow a wheelchair to turn around, and handrails. The train has no restaurant or bar, but was equipped with vending machines, while Business Car passengers also get seat service. Certain cars were equipped with on-board telephones, in anticipation of the construction of a base system.

The per capita energy consumption of a fully loaded 700T train is 16% of private cars and half of buses, carbon dioxide emissions are 11% and a fourth, respectively.

== Operation ==

As of September 2024, the THSR 700T trains ran without a serious accident. During the 2010 Kaohsiung earthquake on March 4, 2010, the wheels of one bogie of a train came off the rails during emergency braking, but there were no injuries and the train arrived at the next station after one hour of repairs.

In November 2010, following complaints when waiting lines formed at the toilets, THSRC changed the gender assignment of the toilets in the 700T trains. In the original configuration, in each car with toilets, there was a men&#x27;s toilet with urinal and two unisex toilets; one of the latter was reassigned as women&#x27;s toilet.

== Train simulator ==

A THSR 700T train simulator, known as &quot;&quot;, was developed jointly by Taiwan-based company Actainment and Japanese company Ongakukan in 2007, based on the latter&#x27;s Train Simulator series. The software was released on the PlayStation 3 system in Asia (Hong Kong, Taiwan, &amp; Singapore) on July 12, 2007, and in Japan on November 1, 2007.

<doc id="538547" wikidata="Q1076831" url="?curid=538547" title="Alan McGee">
<text>Alan John McGee (born 29 September 1960) is a Scottish businessman and music industry executive. He has been a record label owner, musician, manager, and music blogger for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He co-founded the independent Creation Records label, running it from 1983 until its closure in 1999.

McGee subsequently founded the Poptones label, running it from 1999 to 2007. He has managed or championed acts such as the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Telescopes, Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Momus, Oasis, and the Libertines. He was also the lead singer and guitarist for the indie pop group Biff Bang Pow!, who were active from 1983 to 1991.

==Early years==
McGee was born in Partick on 29 September 1960. He grew up in Glasgow and attended King&#x27;s Park Secondary School, where he met future Primal Scream founder Bobby Gillespie. McGee left school at 16 with one O-grade. He and Gillespie were heavily into punk rock, and they joined a local punk band, the Drains, in 1978. The band&#x27;s guitarist was Andrew Innes.

After the breakup of the Drains, McGee and Innes briefly joined the band H2O, then moved to London and formed the band the Laughing Apple with Mark Jardim, a drummer from Croydon. In 1983, quitting his job at British Rail, he co-founded Creation Records (named after cult 1960s band the Creation).

McGee said that his intention with Creation &quot;was to merge psychedelia with punk rock&quot;. He also formed the band Biff Bang Pow! (named after the Creation&#x27;s song), which would continue until 1991, and began running a club night called &quot;The Living Room&quot; at The Adams Arms in Central London. He also began managing the then-unknown band the Jesus and Mary Chain, whose first single was issued on McGee&#x27;s label in November 1984.

==Music industry career==
===Creation Records===
Creation Records was one of the key labels in the mid-80s indie movement, with early releases featuring artists such as Primal Scream, the Jasmine Minks, and the Loft. When the Jesus and Mary Chain moved to Warner Brothers in 1985, Creation was able to use McGee&#x27;s profits as their manager to release singles by acts including Primal Scream, Felt, and the Weather Prophets. While these records were not commercially successful, McGee&#x27;s enthusiasm and ability to promote Creation releases in the weekly music media ensured a healthy following. Following an unsuccessful attempt to run an offshoot label for Warner Brothers, McGee regrouped Creation and immersed himself in the burgeoning dance and acid house scene, the legacy of which saw him release era-defining albums from Creation mainstays Primal Scream and new arrivals like My Bloody Valentine and Teenage Fanclub.

During this time Creation had run up considerable debts, which forced McGee to sell half of the label to Sony Music in 1992. McGee calls the Sony years as the beginning of the end of the &quot;real&quot; Creation Records, which was driven by Joe Foster, Tim Abbot, Dick Green and McGee himself, and not by Sony accountants and marketing managers. At the point it seemed Creation would collapse into receivership, the recently signed Manchester band Oasis began selling albums in huge quantities, and became one of the leading lights of the Britpop movement of the mid-1990s. The success of Oasis was unprecedented for an act on an independent label, and their second album, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, became the biggest-selling British album of the decade.

This brought McGee substantial exposure, and his position was noted by the revitalized Labour Party, who considered him a figurehead of youth culture and courted his influence to spearhead a media campaign prior to the 1997 General Election. McGee was largely responsible for changing government legislation in relation to musicians being able to go on the &quot;New Deal&quot;, which gave musicians three years to develop and be funded by the government instead of having to take other jobs to survive. In 1998, &quot;Omnibus&quot; made a documentary about McGee and Creation for BBC One.

McGee was awarded by the &quot;NME&quot; &#x27;Godlike Genius&#x27; award in February 1996 and Creation Records was awarded &quot;independent label of the year&quot; every year between 1995 and 1998 by &quot;Music Week&quot;. McGee returned to making music in 1997, collaborating with Ed Ball under the name the Chemical Pilot, releasing the album &quot;Journey to the Centre of the Mind&quot; in 1998.

While Oasis went on to sell nearly 54 million records by 2008, Creation continued issuing albums by other artists, none of which came near the success of the Manchester band. Rumours began to circulate of McGee&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the direction Creation had gone. In late 1999 it was announced that Creation Records would cease operations. The final album released by the label was Primal Scream&#x27;s 2000 release &quot;XTRMNTR&quot;, which went gold in the UK.

===Post Creation: Poptones Records and Death Disco===
The dissolution of Creation Records led to McGee forming Poptones in 2000. The label is named after a song by Public Image Limited. During this period McGee also ran an international club night, Death Disco, under which name he also DJs occasionally. Death Disco had branches in Glasgow, London, New York City, Budapest and Los Angeles, and featured appearances from artists such as the Libertines, the Killers, BRMC, Kaiser Chiefs, Glasvegas, Razorlight, the Hives, Kasabian, the Darkness, Neils Children, and the Foxes. McGee had no further involvement with Death Disco after 2009.

In May 2007, McGee told &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper that he was winding down Poptones for financial reasons.
===Retirement from music management and other activities===
On 12 September 2008, McGee retired from band music management and being involved with record companies after 25 years. The decision was due to his wanting to concentrate on raising his child. After he sold Creation Records to Sony, he continued to publish songs by label acts such as Oasis, Primal Scream, My Bloody Valentine, Swervedriver, Teenage Fanclub, Eugene Kelly of the Vaselines, under Creation Songs.

In 2007, McGee was made a Companion of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, in recognition of the work that he has carried out with students. In November 2008, he was a visiting fellow on the popular music degree course at the University of Gloucestershire. In interviews with the Glasgow&#x27;s &quot;Daily Record&quot; in September 2010 and the UK&#x27;s &quot;The Independent&quot; in October 2010, McGee stated he had lost interest in music and was more interested in the esoteric and occult teachings of Aleister Crowley and Peter J. Carroll, particularly Carroll&#x27;s book &quot;Liber Null&quot;.

===359 Music===
In October 2012, McGee stated that he was going help curate the Japanese rock festival Tokyo Rocks in 2013 and through working with Tokyo Rocks had become interested in starting up an as yet unnamed record label in 2013. In May 2013, McGee announced the new label as a joint venture with Cherry Red Records called 359 Music. He stated he saw it as launch pad for new artists. In the ensuing month he reviewed 2500 submissions for signing, eventually signing 20 artists.

===Creation Management===
McGee announced in May 2014 he had restarted Creation Management with Simon Fletcher and signed the Jesus and Mary Chain as his first clients. The roster subsequently expanded to include Wilko Johnson, Happy Mondays, Black Grape, Cast, Glasvegas, the Bluetones, and Shaun William Ryder solo projects.

===Creation23===
In August 2018, Alan McGee announced the launch of a new 7-inch label named Creation23, also with Fletcher. The label&#x27;s first release was from North Essex group Rubber Jaw.

In 2020 McGee set up the Creation Day festival, in collaboration with the City of Wolverhampton Council. The festival was originally due to be held at West Park, Wolverhampton on 29–30 May 2021, with Happy Mondays, Editors, and Echo and the Bunnymen as headliners, but was delayed for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The festival, now branded as the Utilita Creation Day festival, is now due to take place on 28–29 May 2022, featuring IDLES and Happy Mondays as headliners, as well as Glasvegas, Sleeper, Ash, and several acts signed to Creation23.

==Political views==
In January 2000 he likened the Labour Party to Big Brother in George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, and accused Tony Blair of being a &quot;control freak&quot;. He had previously been one of Labour&#x27;s biggest financial donors, having donated £100,000 to the party.

One of McGee&#x27;s last acts as the head of Creation Records was to use £20,000 of the company&#x27;s money to fund Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s campaign to run for Mayor of London.

In late 2009, McGee withdrew his support for the Labour Party, and wrote an article for &quot;The Sun&quot; on 1 October 2009 in which he praised Conservative leader David Cameron, saying that &quot;at least David Cameron looks like a leader.&quot;

In the 2010 general election, McGee stated that he had voted for Liberal Democrat Roger Williams.

==Other media==
From 2006 to 2010, Alan McGee wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s weekly music blog. As of September 2011, McGee blogs for &quot;The Huffington Post UK&quot;.

===Autobiography===
McGee&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Creation Stories&quot; was scheduled to be published in Europe on 7 November 2013, by Pan MacMillan. McGee&#x27;s autobiography was optioned by Burning Wheel Productions and has been adapted into a film screenplay by Irvine Welsh and Dean Cavanagh, due to be introduced at the next Cannes Film Festival.

===Films===
&quot;Upside Down&quot;, a film about Creation Records, premiered at the BFI in London on 23 and 24 October 2010. It was scheduled for worldwide release in May 2011.

In February 2012, McGee announced in the Huffington Post that he had started a new film company with writer and director Dean Cavanagh, who still works with Irvine Welsh, called Escalier 39. The film &quot;Kubricks&quot; was scheduled to be shot in 2012 on the grounds of McGee&#x27;s house in Wales. In the film McGee plays himself. He appears in &quot;Svengali&quot;, which premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in June 2013. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, McGee &quot;enjoys a surprising amount of screen-time and, in what is perhaps a deliberate in-joke, is never seen without his Trilby hat&quot;.

McGee features extensively in the documentary film &quot;Teenage Superstars&quot;, which focuses on the Glasgow independent music scene during the early years of Creation Records.

&quot;Creation Stories&quot; is a 2021 biographical film about McGee and Creation, directed by Nick Moran. The film was adapted from McGee&#x27;s autobiography by Welsh and Cavanagh.

==Personal life==
McGee&#x27;s mid-1990s drug intake was such that he eventually suffered a breakdown. He has said he has no idea of the amounts of drugs he was using at this point, but that he cannot remember anything of the year 1993 other than the signing of Oasis. He added that Oasis were &#x27;cool&#x27; about his cleaning up, but that his sober state made his relationship with Primal Scream difficult.

McGee has been married twice. His first marriage was unsuccessful but produced a son named Daniel. Due to McGee&#x27;s former long-term drug habit, he had been estranged from his first wife and had not seen his son since he was a baby. Dan was adopted by his ex-wife&#x27;s new husband in 1994 and his name was changed to Daniel Devine. In 2005, McGee told &quot;The Independent&quot; that his son, whom he had not seen since he was a baby, had contacted him and they had reunited, though they were later reported to be estranged again.

Since 1998, McGee has been married to Kate Holmes, of the band Client and formerly of Frazier Chorus and Technique, who now runs the fashion label Client London. They have been together since 1994, and have one child.

McGee is a supporter of Rangers.

<doc id="538548" wikidata="Q7350370" url="?curid=538548" title="Robert Thorburn (politician)">
<text>Sir Robert Thorburn (March 28, 1836 – April 12, 1906) was a British-born Newfoundlander merchant and politician who served as the Premier of Newfoundland Colony from 1885 to 1889.

== Life ==
Born in Scotland, Thorburn emigrated to Newfoundland in 1852 when he was sixteen. From 1870 to 1885 and again from 1893 to 1906 he was a member of the colony&#x27;s appointed Legislative Council, the Upper House of Newfoundland&#x27;s parliament.

Thorburn was an opponent of Sir William Whiteway&#x27;s plans to build a cross-Newfoundland railway as a means of diversifying and industrialising the economy. Thorburn, a leading merchant, argued that the colony should be developed along strict commercial lines based on the fisheries.

Traditionally, Newfoundland politics had been divided along sectarian lines with Catholics supporting the Liberals and Protestants supporting the Conservative Party of Newfoundland. Whiteway, however, who had been elected as a Conservative with the support of Protestants had lost the support of much of the business community with his support of the railway over the fishery and reached out to the Catholic Liberals In order to stay in power creating a cross denominational coalition.

Thorburn created the &quot;New Party&quot; to represent the interest of St. John&#x27;s businessmen.

The Harbour Grace Affray, an 1883 sectarian melee between Irish Catholics of Riverhead and the Southside of Harbour Grace who confronted a parade of Orangemen. The resulting battle killed five and wounded seventeen. The riot strained relations between Catholics and Protestants and led to the collapse of Whiteway&#x27;s government when Protestants deserted it.

The religious violence gave Thorburn an opportunity. He joined with Orangemen and Protestants who had deserted Whiteway&#x27;s government in the wake of the riot to create a new party, the &quot;Reform Party&quot; as a &quot;Protestant Rights&quot; organization and swept to power in the 1885 election making Thorburn the new premier.

In power, Thorburn&#x27;s government turned away from the sectarian agenda that had brought it to power and implemented Thorburn&#x27;s real agenda, the rejection of the railway plan and focussing on developing the economy along the fishers. An economic downturn was exacerbated by the colony&#x27;s one industry economy forcing Thorburn to belatedly reverse himself and implement a public works agenda. It was too late, however, and Thorburn was defeated in 1889 by Whiteway and his new Liberal Party which had been created to promote the railway plan. The Reform Party collapsed and a new Tory Party emerged from its ashes but was only able to hold power twice for brief periods before disappearing.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Red Widow&quot; is a short Sherlock Holmes murder mystery by Adrian Conan Doyle, the youngest son of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock Holmes creator. The story was published in the 1954 collection &quot;The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 2 October 1953, and was illustrated by Robert Fawcett in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;.

== Plot ==
Holmes and Watson are invited by Scotland Yard Inspector Gregson to accompany him to an ancient country mansion in Derbyshire. The crime scene remains undisturbed, indicating that the lord of the manor has been decapitated by the guillotine in his own museum. His head and his cousin, Captain Lothian, are both missing, along with a horse from the stable. Holmes annoys a local police inspector named Dawlish by lingering over the crime scene, but quickly resolves the mystery.

<text>Kamaal Ibn John Fareed (born Jonathan William Davis, April 10, 1970), better known by his stage name Q-Tip, is an American rapper, record producer, singer, and DJ. Nicknamed the Abstract, he is noted for his innovative jazz-influenced style of hip hop production and his philosophical, esoteric and introspective lyrical themes. He embarked on his music career in the late 1980s, as an MC and main producer of the influential alternative hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest. In the mid-1990s, he co-founded the production team The Ummah, followed by the release of his gold-certified solo debut &quot;Amplified&quot; in 1999. In the following decade, he released the Grammy Award-nominated album &quot;The Renaissance&quot; (2008) and the experimental album &quot;Kamaal the Abstract&quot; (2009).

As an actor, Q-Tip has appeared in various films, such as &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;, &quot;She Hate Me&quot;, and &quot;Prison Song&quot;, the latter of which he co-wrote and played the lead role. As a DJ, he has hosted the Apple Music 1 radio show &quot;Abstract Radio&quot; since 2015. In 2016, Q-Tip was named the artistic director for hip hop culture at the Kennedy Center, and in 2018, he became the instructor of a jazz and hip hop course at New York University&#x27;s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music.

Q-Tip is one of the most acclaimed figures in hip hop. AllMusic states that he &quot;led a jazz-based hip-hop revolution during the &#x27;90s&quot;, calling him &quot;the best rapper/producer in hip-hop history&quot;. Several publications have ranked him as one the greatest rappers and hip hop producers of all time, with &quot;The Source&quot; ranking him the 20th greatest rap lyricist, and &quot;Billboard&quot; ranking him the sixth greatest hip hop producer. In 2024, Q-Tip was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of A Tribe Called Quest.

== Early life ==
Q-Tip was born Jonathan William Davis on April 10, 1970, in Harlem, New York City. His father, Jonathan Davis II, emigrated from the Caribbean island of Montserrat and was raised in Cleveland. His mother is an African American from Alabama. When he was a child, his family settled in St. Albans, Queens, New York City. He first met his friend Phife Dawg at church when they were both two years old. At age nine, he began rapping after being encouraged by Phife Dawg; shortly before that, they both heard &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; by The Sugarhill Gang for the first time. He was also inspired by his father&#x27;s extensive jazz record collection, and at age 12, he began to DJ and make pause tape beats.

Q-Tip attended Murry Bergtraum High School in Manhattan, where he first befriended Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Afrika Baby Bam and Mike Gee, with the latter two forming the hip-hop group Jungle Brothers. In high school, he participated in rap battles and went by the stage names J Nice and MC Love Child. In 1985, he and Muhammad formed an MC and DJ duo, and using recording equipment provided by Muhammad&#x27;s uncle, they began making demos. They were later joined by Phife Dawg, who also rapped, and neighborhood friend Jarobi White; collectively, they were known as Quest.

When Q-Tip was 16 years old, his father died of emphysema.

== Career ==
===1988–1993: Early success with A Tribe Called Quest===

Afrika Baby Bam gave him the nickname &quot;Q-Tip&quot;, which became popular in high school, eventually becoming his stage name. In 1988, Q-Tip was featured on Jungle Brothers&#x27; songs &quot;The Promo&quot;, which he helped produce, and &quot;Black Is Black&quot;, in which he renamed his group A Tribe Called Quest, a name that was given by Afrika Baby Bam. Both songs appeared on Jungle Brothers&#x27; debut album, &quot;Straight out the Jungle&quot;. That year, the two groups met the like-minded group De La Soul, with the three groups forming the core of the Native Tongues collective, known for their Afrocentrism, positivity and eclectic sampling.

In 1989, A Tribe Called Quest signed with Jive Records after being rejected by several labels, due to their unconventional image and sound. After recording several demos, they began working on their debut album, with Q-Tip serving as the group&#x27;s main producer. During this period, Q-Tip began using the E-mu SP-1200 and Akai S950 samplers. The album, &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot;, was released in early 1990 and established Q-Tip as a highly skilled lyricist. Later that year, he made a guest appearance on the house single &quot;Groove Is in the Heart&quot; by Deee-Lite, which became a worldwide hit.

In 1991, A Tribe Called Quest released their second album, &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;. Wanting the group to &quot;step it up in general&quot;, Q-Tip encouraged Phife Dawg, who had recently become diabetic, to stay with the group and increase his participation. The result was the &quot;smoothest&quot; rapping &quot;of any rap record ever heard&quot;, due to the duo&#x27;s strong chemistry. The group also garnered acclaim for Q-Tip&#x27;s jazzy minimalist production.

The following year, Q-Tip was involved in a fight with new jack swing group Wreckx-n-Effect, over Phife Dawg&#x27;s lyrics on the single &quot;Jazz (We&#x27;ve Got)&quot;. As a result, it is believed that the ski mask that Q-Tip wore, in A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s video for the single &quot;Hot Sex&quot;, was covering up his injuries.

By 1993, Q-Tip became known for his outside production work, producing the hit single &quot;Gangsta Bitch&quot; by Apache, among other songs. The song&#x27;s chorus was performed by Tupac Shakur in the film &quot;Poetic Justice&quot;, in which Q-Tip made his acting debut as Janet Jackson&#x27;s love interest. Later that year, A Tribe Called Quest released their third album, &quot;Midnight Marauders&quot;, which was hailed as the group&#x27;s most complete work. Along with his &quot;practically telepathic&quot; lyrical interplay with Phife Dawg, the album introduced Q-Tip&#x27;s gritty style of production.

===1994–1995: Production work and formation of the Ummah===
After two critically acclaimed platinum-selling albums with his group, Q-Tip began focusing on outside production. In 1994, he produced the single &quot;One Love&quot; from Nas&#x27;s debut album &quot;Illmatic&quot; and performed the song&#x27;s chorus. He also remixed the Nas single &quot;The World Is Yours&quot;, as well as Craig Mack&#x27;s single &quot;Get Down&quot;, in which he contributed a guest verse. He made an additional guest appearance on the song &quot;Get It Together&quot; by Beastie Boys, from their album &quot;Ill Communication&quot;.

Film director Spike Lee asked Q-Tip to produce the single &quot;Crooklyn&quot; for the soundtrack to his 1994 film of the same name. Q-Tip helped Lee recruit three Brooklyn MCs for the song: Special Ed, Masta Ace and Buckshot, who formed the group Crooklyn Dodgers.

During that year&#x27;s Lollapalooza, keyboardist Amp Fiddler introduced Q-Tip to young Detroit producer Jay Dee, who gave Q-Tip a demo tape of his group Slum Village. After being impressed by Jay Dee&#x27;s beats, Q-Tip suggested that the two work together. By 1995, Q-Tip, Jay Dee and Muhammad formed a production team, known as The Ummah, in which each member produced songs individually and received a songwriting credit for their work. He and Muhammad also created a label, Museum Music, with Vinia Mojica becoming their first artist.

Queens duo Mobb Deep, whom Q-Tip discovered in the early 1990s, enlisted him as a mixing engineer and producer for their 1995 album &quot;The Infamous&quot;. He also contributed a verse to the song &quot;Drink Away the Pain (Situations)&quot;.

===1996–1998: Declining group chemistry to breakup===
In 1996, The Ummah&#x27;s production first appeared on Busta Rhymes&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Coming&quot;, with Q-Tip producing and rapping on the song &quot;Ill Vibe&quot;, while Jay Dee produced the other two Ummah productions on the album. That summer, A Tribe Called Quest released their fourth album, &quot;Beats, Rhymes and Life&quot;, which was produced by The Ummah. Although Q-Tip was involved in the album&#x27;s production, he considered the album a &quot;showcase&quot; for Jay Dee, who produced both of the singles, &quot;1nce Again&quot; and &quot;Stressed Out&quot;, along with three other songs. Q-Tip also added his younger cousin Consequence as a guest rapper on six songs. Much of the album&#x27;s lyrical themes were inspired by Q-Tip&#x27;s recent conversion to Islam; however, his relationship with Phife Dawg became strained, negatively affecting their lyrical chemistry. Q-Tip also became an A&amp;R for Motown Records and signed Consequence to Museum Music.

The following year, he made a guest appearance on Janet Jackson&#x27;s single &quot;Got &#x27;til It&#x27;s Gone&quot; and co-produced Mariah Carey&#x27;s single &quot;Honey&quot;, both of which became worldwide hits. In early 1998, a fire completely destroyed Q-Tip&#x27;s home recording studio; among the items destroyed in the blaze were his entire record collection, consisting of nearly 20,000 vinyl records, and a computer containing many unreleased songs. The fire delayed the release of A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The Love Movement&quot;, pushing the release date from May to September of that year. Produced by The Ummah, the album explored the lyrical theme of love; however, A Tribe Called Quest disbanded a month before the album&#x27;s release.

===1999–2000: &quot;Amplified&quot; and solo success===

After the breakup of his group, Q-Tip began pursuing a solo career in 1999. He collaborated with R&amp;B singer Raphael Saadiq and released the hit single &quot;Get Involved&quot;. Later that year, he signed with Arista Records and released his solo debut, &quot;Amplified&quot;, which he produced with Jay Dee. The album was promoted by the hit singles &quot;Vivrant Thing&quot; and &quot;Breathe and Stop&quot;, which were more pop-oriented than his previous work with A Tribe Called Quest. However, other songs on the album maintained the ethos of the group and it received mostly positive reviews from critics. In January 2000, it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and &quot;Vivrant Thing&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, presented a month later at the 42nd Grammy Awards.

Q-Tip described his house fire as &quot;symbolic&quot;, because he was left with no records to sample, but still had the desire to make music. In late 1999, he began seeking musicians for a live band, taking drum lessons from Omar Hakim, studying bel canto, and taking piano lessons from Weldon Irvine, whom he sampled for A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s &quot;Award Tour&quot; single. He also became a member of the Soulquarians collective during this period.

===2001–2007: Label issues and collaborations===
In 2001, Q-Tip starred in the film &quot;Prison Song&quot;, which he co-wrote with the film&#x27;s director, Darnell Martin. He also contributed to the film score, producing four songs. That year, he completed his follow-up album &quot;Kamaal the Abstract&quot;, which was recorded with a live band and featured Q-Tip singing the majority of its songs. Originally slated for release in October 2001, the release date was pushed to April 2002, before Arista record executives decided not to release it, doubting its commercial potential. Q-Tip explained his label situation during this period:

During this period, between album releases, Q-Tip recorded about 500 songs, about 300 of which were instrumentals. His 2002 guest appearance on Large Professor&#x27;s song &quot;In the Sun&quot; earned him &quot;Rhyme of the Month&quot; in &quot;The Source&quot;. In 2003, he co-produced &quot;Heartcore&quot;, an album by jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel. In 2005, he released the single &quot;For the Nasty&quot; on the Motown label, featuring Busta Rhymes, and was featured on The Chemical Brothers&#x27; hit single &quot;Galvanize&quot;, from their album &quot;Push the Button&quot;. The following year, &quot;Galvanize&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording, earning Q-Tip his first Grammy Award.

Jay Dee, who later went by the name J Dilla, died of the blood disease TTP in February 2006, with Q-Tip serving as a pallbearer at his funeral. The two had planned to work on a collaborative album, &quot;Buddy Lee&quot;, before his death. That year, A Tribe Called Quest reunited for a tour across North America. In 2007, Q-Tip signed with Universal Motown Records and released the single &quot;Work It Out&quot;.

===2008–2009: &quot;The Renaissance&quot; and &quot;Kamaal the Abstract&quot;===

His second official album, &quot;The Renaissance&quot;, was released in late 2008, through Universal Motown, and included reworked songs from his shelved &quot;Open&quot; album. It spawned the singles &quot;Gettin&#x27; Up&quot; and &quot;Move&quot;, which was produced by J Dilla. The album garnered widespread acclaim from critics, who praised it as a return to his A Tribe Called Quest roots. It became his highest-charting album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, at number 11, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, presented at the 52nd Grammy Awards in 2010.

After being shelved for seven years, &quot;Kamaal the Abstract&quot; was finally released in September 2009, through Battery Records. The album received mostly positive reviews from critics, including reviews from its initial press run in 2002.

===2010–2016: Production work and final group album===
Q-Tip was among a group of producers who were brought to work on Kanye West&#x27;s 2010 album, &quot;My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy&quot;. In 2011, his production eventually appeared on West and Jay-Z&#x27;s collaborative album &quot;Watch the Throne&quot;, contributing to the songs &quot;Lift Off&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s My Bitch&quot;. The following year, Q-Tip signed to West&#x27;s GOOD Music label, through Def Jam, and prepared the release of his new album, &quot;The Last Zulu&quot;.

In 2013, Q-Tip announced that A Tribe Called Quest would perform their last show, as an opening act for West&#x27;s Yeezus Tour, and the following year, he produced the song &quot;Meteorite&quot; for Mariah Carey and co-wrote &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Easy&quot; and &quot;Sugah Daddy&quot; from D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Black Messiah&quot; album. However, in 2015, the group performed live on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; to commemorate the 25th anniversary of &quot;People&#x27;s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&quot;. That year, Q-Tip began hosting the radio show &quot;Abstract Radio&quot; on Apple Music 1, explaining that his intent was &quot;rather than just follow any sort of current, what&#x27;s popular...to try [instead] to figure out how to bridge many gaps and bring it all into one singular voice of good music.&quot;

In March 2016, Q-Tip was appointed as the Kennedy Center&#x27;s first artistic director for hip-hop culture, curating a series of hip-hop programs for the performing arts center. Later that month, Phife Dawg died of complications relating to diabetes. That October, Q-Tip revealed that A Tribe Called Quest secretly began working on a new album shortly after their &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance, completing the album after Phife Dawg&#x27;s death. The following month, the group released their final album, &quot;We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service&quot;, which received widespread acclaim from critics.

=== 2017–present: &quot;The Last Zulu&quot;, &quot;AlGoRhythms&quot;, and &quot;Riotdiaries&quot; ===
In 2018, he recorded a cover version of Elton John and Kiki Dee&#x27;s song &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot; with Demi Lovato. He also announced that his delayed album &quot;The Last Zulu&quot; would be released soon. Later that year, he joined the faculty of New York University&#x27;s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, where he began teaching a course that explores the connection between jazz and hip hop. In an October 2018 interview, he claimed that he would never retire or cease production work, stating, &quot;I will do this to my death.&quot;

In 2019, Q-Tip revealed that he was working on three solo albums (&quot;The Last Zulu&quot;, &quot;AlGoRhythms&quot;, and &quot;Riotdiaries&quot;), as well as projects by Mary J. Blige and Danny Brown. He served as executive producer of Brown&#x27;s album &quot;U Know What I&#x27;m Sayin?&quot;, released in October 2019. Later that year, he also appeared on the song &quot;Hit Man&quot; from Gang Starr&#x27;s album &quot;One of the Best Yet&quot;. 
Q-Tip performed the chorus on the song &quot;Yah Yah&quot; from Eminem&#x27;s 2020 album, &quot;Music to Be Murdered By&quot;. He also performed the chorus on the track &quot;More Life&quot;, which he co-produced, from Cordae&#x27;s 2021 EP, &quot;Just Until...&quot; Jack White&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;Fear of the Dawn&quot; features Q-Tip on the single &quot;Hi-De-Ho&quot;.

Q-Tip is the producer of LL Cool J&#x27;s 2024 album, &quot;The FORCE&quot;.

==Musical style==
=== Production ===
As a producer, Q-Tip is a self-proclaimed &quot;perfectionist-at-work&quot; and is known for his innovative and experimental production, which &quot;led a jazz-based hip-hop revolution during the &#x27;90s&quot;. In particular, he is noted for his ability to layer programmed drums, giving the drums a grittier sound; his unconventional use of three-bar loops; and his frequent use of rests (or &quot;space&quot;), which was inspired by Miles Davis.

Pharrell Williams has stated that Q-Tip &quot;picks the best loops  ... he&#x27;d pick like the illest chord, bassline and all that.&quot; Williams asserted that &quot;we&#x27;re all [Q-Tip&#x27;s] sons&quot;, referring to himself, J Dilla and Kanye West, further stating that &quot;we wouldn&#x27;t be here man, if it wasn&#x27;t for Tribe albums.&quot; 9th Wonder credits him for starting the trend of jazz sampling in hip hop:

Q-Tip&#x27;s recent production is a mix of live instrumentation and sampled music. Two decades after his house fire, he has since rebuilt his record collection; as of 2016, it consists of about 9,000 vinyl records.

===Lyricism and rapping technique===
As an MC, Q-Tip is noted for his philosophical, esoteric and introspective lyricism, often putting socially conscious messages in his lyrics. He writes his lyrics to the beat, allowing the music to help serve as inspiration for his songwriting. Q-Tip&#x27;s flow is commonly described as &quot;mellow&quot; and &quot;smooth&quot;. When rapping, he treats his voice &quot;like an instrument&quot; in the music and is noted for his &quot;flexible&quot; rhyme schemes.

==Personal life==
Q-Tip converted to Islam in the mid-1990s, changing his name to Kamaal Ibn John Fareed. He also follows a vegetarian diet and practices Transcendental Meditation.

He has been romantically linked to Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Angie Martinez and Nicole Kidman. He is also a longtime friend of actor Leonardo DiCaprio and comedian Dave Chappelle.

According to a DNA analysis he took in 2012, Q-Tip is descended, mainly, from the Jola people of Guinea-Bissau.

As of 2016, he has lived in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, and in nearby Edgewater.

<text>The Great Ape Project (GAP), founded in 1993, is an international organization of primatologists, anthropologists, ethicists, and others who advocate a United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Great Apes that would confer basic legal rights on non-human great apes: bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.

The rights suggested are the right to life, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of torture. The organization also monitors individual great ape activity in the United States through a census program. Once rights are established, GAP would demand the release of great apes from captivity; currently 3,100 are held in the U.S., including 1,280 in biomedical research facilities.

==&quot;The Great Ape Project&quot; (book)==
The 1994 book &quot;The Great Ape Project: Equality Beyond Humanity&quot;, edited by philosophers Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer, features contributions from thirty-four authors, including Jane Goodall and Richard Dawkins, who have submitted articles voicing their support for the project. The authors write that human beings are intelligent animals with a varied social, emotional, and cognitive life. If great apes also display such attributes, the authors argue, they deserve the same consideration humans extend to members of their own species.

The book highlights findings that support the capacity of great apes to possess rationality and self-consciousness, and the ability to be aware of themselves as distinct entities with a past and future. Documented conversations (in sign languages) with individual great apes are the basis for these findings. Other subjects addressed within the book include the division placed between humans and great apes, great apes as persons, progress in gaining rights for the severely intellectually disabled (once an overlooked minority), and the situation of great apes in the world today.

== World Declaration on Great Apes==

The Great Ape Project is campaigning to have the United Nations endorse a World Declaration on Great Apes. This would extend what the project calls the &quot;community of equals&quot; to include chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. The declaration seeks to extend to non-human great apes the protection of three basic interests: the right to life, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of torture.

===Right to life===
The declaration states that members of the community of equals, which includes humans, have an essential right to life and may not be killed except in certain strictly defined circumstances such as self-defense.

===Protection of individual liberty===
The declaration states that members of the community of equals are not to be deprived of their liberty, and are entitled to immediate release where there has been no form of due process. Under the proposed declaration, the detention of great apes who have not been convicted of any crime or who are not criminally liable should be permitted only where it can be shown that the detention is in their own interests or is necessary to protect the public. The declaration says there must be a right of appeal, either directly or through an advocate, to a judicial tribunal.

===Prohibition of torture===
The declaration prohibits the torture, defined as the deliberate infliction of severe pain, on any great ape, whether wantonly or because of a perceived benefit to others.
Under International Human Rights Law this is a &quot;jus cogens&quot; principle and under all major human rights documents it cannot at any time be derogated by any State.

==Opposition==

===Humanist opposition===
Professor Colin Blakemore, head of the Medical Research Council in the United Kingdom from 2003–2007, is opposed to granting rights to non-human apes, stating &quot;I can see no current necessity for the use of great apes, and I&#x27;m pleased that they&#x27;re not being used and that every effort is being made to reduce the use of other primates. But I worry about the principle of where the moral boundaries lie. There is only one very secure definition that can be made, and that is between our species and others.&quot; Blakemore suggests that it would be necessary to perform research on great apes if humans were threatened by a pandemic virus that afflicted only humans and other great apes. The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection described Blakemore&#x27;s stance as &quot;backward-looking&quot;.

===Sentiencism opposition===
Professor Gary Francione criticized the philosophical basis of the project, that he calls &quot;similar minds&quot;. For him, it is wrong: sentience only is relevant for the right to not to be exploited and killed if there is no absolute necessity to do so (for example for self-defense).

==Recent developments==
===United States===
A study commissioned by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concluded in a report (see report brief) released on 15 December 2011 that &quot;while the chimpanzee has been a valuable animal model in past research, most current use of chimpanzees for biomedical research is unnecessary&quot;. The primary recommendation is that the use of chimpanzees in research be guided by a set of principles and criteria, in effect to greatly limit government-funded research using chimpanzees. Falling short of calling for the out-right ban of using chimpanzees for research, the report acknowledged that new emerging, or re-emerging diseases may require the use of chimpanzees, echoing Professor Colin Blakemore&#x27;s concern.

Francis Collins, Director of NIH announced on the same day the report was released that he accepted the recommendations and will develop the implementation plan which includes the forming of an expert committee to review all submitted grant applications and projects already underway involving the use of chimpanzees. Furthermore, no new grant applications using chimpanzees will be reviewed until further notice.

On 21 September 2012, NIH announced that 110 chimpanzees owned by the government will be retired. NIH owns about 500 chimpanzees for research, this move signifies the first step to wind down NIH&#x27;s investment in chimpanzee research, according to Francis Collins. Currently housed at the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana, 10 of the retired chimpanzees will go to the chimpanzee sanctuary Chimp Haven while the rest will go to Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio.
However concerns over the chimpanzee&#x27;s status in the Texas Biomedical Research Institute as &quot;research ineligible&quot; rather than &quot;retired&quot; prompted NIH to reconsider the plan and it announced on 17 October 2012 that as many chimpanzees as possible will be relocated to Chimp Haven by August 2013 and eventually all 110 will move there.

On 22 January 2013, a NIH task force released a report calling for the government to retire most of the chimpanzees the U.S. government support. The panel concluded that the animals provide little benefit in biomedical discoveries except in a few disease cases which can be supported by a small population of 50 primates for future research. Other approaches such as genetically altered mice should be developed and refined.

On 13 November 2013, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate passed The Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance and Protection Act, approving the funding to expand the capacity of Chimp Haven and other chimpanzee sanctuaries, thus allowing the transfer of almost all of the apes owned by the federal government to live in a more natural and group environment than in the laboratory. The transfer is expected to take five years when all but 50 chimpanzees, which will remain with the NIH, will be &quot;retired&quot;.

===Germany===
The Great Ape Project achieved many of its goals in its early years: New Zealand completely banned invasive experiments on great apes in 1999, as did the Balearic Islands (an autonomous region of the monarchy of Spain) in 2007, deciding to implement certain fundamental rights for great apes in their code of law. However, the project entered a long period of political stagnation in Europe. All hopes that the achievements on the Balearic Islands would spark off further steps on the mainland of Spain and from there to other European countries proved to be futile. Efforts in Spain were largely curtailed due to the influence of the Catholic Church, obstructing the project&#x27;s goals. In 2011, however, the project was given an official relaunch in Germany, supported by the Germany-based Giordano-Bruno-Stiftung.

Great Ape Project Germany filed an official law initiative in spring of 2014, to have the aforesaid fundamental rights for great apes implemented into the constitutional law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The goal was (and still is) to have the animal welfare law extended to specifically grant the great apes the rights needed, to give them the chance, to have legal guardians representing their interests. In analogy to infants or of people suffering from dementia or Alzheimer disease, who cannot speak for themselves, legal guardians could file lawsuits against anyone violating the fundamental rights of the apes. Right now there are only animal protection laws, giving the animals no active legitimization.

<text>The Rising is the twelfth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen, released on July 30, 2002, on Columbia Records. The album is based in large part on Springsteen&#x27;s reflections in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks the year before. The album was a critical and commercial success, representing Springsteen&#x27;s first album to top the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 since &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; in 1987.

Hailed as a triumphant return to form for Springsteen, the album won two Grammy Awards and marked the start of a successful collaboration with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien. &quot;The Rising&quot; came seven years after &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; (1995), the longest interlude between studio albums for the artist, and was his first in almost two decades with the E Street Band, with whom he had recently completed a highly successful reunion tour.

==Background and recording==
Springsteen felt compelled to record &quot;The Rising&quot; when, in the aftermath of the attacks on September 11, 2001, a stranger in an adjacent vehicle rolled down his window and said: &quot;We need you now&quot;. A few of the songs were written before the attacks. The title track tells the story of a firefighter going up the World Trade Center as survivors flee, and evokes the image of peoples&#x27; spirits rising up like angels with a &quot;dream of life&quot;. 

&quot;My City of Ruins&quot; was originally performed in, and written about, Asbury Park. The song took on a new meaning soon after the September 11 attacks, when &quot;its lyrics of hope and rebirth [became] a rallying cry&quot;. Springsteen performed the song live at the &quot;&quot; national telethon 10 days after the attacks. With only a guitar and a harmonica, Springsteen introduced the number as &quot;&#x27;a prayer for our fallen brothers and sisters&#x27;&quot;. &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; is organized around the melody line of Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;People Get Ready&quot;.

&quot;Further On (Up the Road)&quot; was performed live in Madison Square Garden at the end of the Springsteen–E Street Reunion Tour, and was professionally recorded, although it was not included in the HBO, DVD, or CD versions of &quot;Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band: Live in New York City&quot;. 

&quot;Waitin&#x27; on a Sunny Day&quot; was originally written in the 1990s and played during a soundcheck on the Reunion Tour. Springsteen has commented that &quot;Nothing Man&quot; was originally completed in 1994, but re-recorded for this album. 

&quot;Worlds Apart,&quot; the most experimental song on the album, features a heavy Middle Eastern influence along with Qawwali singers in the introduction. 

&quot;The Fuse,&quot; another experimental track, features a subtle hip hop beat and vocal looping. A re-recorded version of the song, with an orchestral backing, features in the Spike Lee-directed film &quot;25th Hour&quot;. 

&quot;Mary&#x27;s Place&quot; is directly inspired by Sam Cooke&#x27;s &quot;Meet Me at Mary&#x27;s Place&quot;;

==Release==
Following the biggest pre-release promotion of Springsteen&#x27;s career and a tour, &quot;The Rising&quot; became Springsteen&#x27;s sixth No. 1 album on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and topped the charts in six other countries, including the UK.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Rising&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. Metacritic gave it an aggregate score of 82 / 100, based on 21 reviews. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Kurt Loder lauded it as a triumphant and cohesive album that possesses a &quot;bold thematic concentration and penetrating emotional focus&quot;. Thom Jurek of &quot;AllMusic&quot; called it &quot;one of the very best examples... of how popular art can evoke a time period and all of its confusing and often contradictory notions, feelings and impulses.&quot; David Browne, writing in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, felt that Springsteen&#x27;s message had a renewed relevance, while his occasionally overburdened lyrics were saved by lively and vivid music. Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that the musically confident album showcased Springsteen&#x27;s strength as an empathic songwriter. &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine called &quot;The Rising&quot; &quot;a brave and beautiful album of humanity, hurt and hope from the songwriter best qualified to speak to and for his country ... A towering achievement.&quot;

In a mixed review for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexis Petridis found the music to be awkwardly old-fashioned, with the best songs featuring strong melodies, as he judged the lyrics to be simplistic and unambiguous. Keith Harris of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; criticised it as being vague and unworldly, and lacking in real-life characters &quot;responding in their idiosyncratic ways.&quot; Robert Christgau cited &quot;Paradise&quot;, &quot;Nothing Man&quot;, &quot;The Rising&quot;, and &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; as &quot;choice cuts&quot;, but concluded that the album &quot;isn&#x27;t worth your time or money&quot;. He felt that a marked patriotism &quot;dragged down&quot; the album with &quot;overburdened emotions and conceptual commonplaces&quot;.

&quot;The Rising&quot; was voted the sixth-best album of 2002 in the Pazz &amp; Jop. Christgau, the poll&#x27;s creator and supervisor, ranked the title track as the year&#x27;s tenth best single. &quot;Kludge&quot; included it on their best albums of 2002. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it the fifteenth best album of the 2000s. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album in 2003; although nominated for the Album of the Year award as well, it was beaten by Norah Jones&#x27;s debut album &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;. The title song &quot;The Rising&quot; was also a Grammy recipient.

==Legacy==
Although &quot;The Rising&quot; was a response to 9/11, many see it as a more universal anthem of resilience and hope. On the tenth anniversary of 9/11, Dan DeLuca of the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; said: &quot;The songs make contextual sense in the aftermath of 9/11, but the specific details that give them power are allusive. &#x27;Lonesome Day,&#x27; &#x27;You&#x27;re Missing,&#x27; and &#x27;My City of Ruins&#x27; are about the hollowing devastation of that day, but the language is universal, so the sentiments are by no means frozen in time.&quot; The song &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; has been used in response to tragedies other than 9/11, such as the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. In 2006, while on tour supporting his &quot;We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions&quot; album, Springsteen performed the song at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. The song received an emotional response from the crowd given its refrain of &quot;Come on rise up!&quot; &quot;The Rising&quot;, given its message of hope in the face of adversity, was featured prominently at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.

<text>Publicis Sapient is a digital consulting company belonging to Publicis Groupe, with 20,000 people and over 50 offices worldwide. It was originally established as Sapient in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1990. In 2015, Sapient became an independent subsidiary of French multinational advertising firm Publicis, following a deal worth US$3.7 billion. It remains headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, and , the leadership is retained.

In 2016, the company merged two of its divisions, SapientNitro and Razorfish, to form SapientRazorfish, which was led by Alan Wexler. A few years later, in 2019, SapientRazorfish and Sapient Consulting were consolidated into one brand, Publicis Sapient, under the leadership of CEO Nigel Vaz.

==History==
The company Sapient was founded on November 6, 1990, by Jerry Greenberg and J. Stuart Moore in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was established as a digital consulting firm and adopted a fixed-term, fixed-price model for IT consulting projects instead of charging on a time and materials basis.

Sapient embraced internet-based technology early on and by 1999, internet-based work accounted for over 70% of its revenue. From 1992 to 2000, the company saw rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $950,000 to $503 million.

Following the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s, Sapient looked to expand internationally to drive growth. The company implemented a strategy called &quot;Global Distributed Delivery&quot; which leveraged the rapidly growing tech market in India to grow its software development capabilities.

Throughout its history, Sapient has made several acquisitions, starting with Planning Group International in 2006. Other notable acquisitions include DCG Group in 2008, which enhanced its capital markets offerings, and The Nitro Group in 2009, which added 300 employees.

===History of acquisitions===
==Corporate affairs==
In 1996, Sapient made its initial public offering with a share price of $21. In the next four years, the technology sector saw an increase in share prices, leading to an increase in Sapient&#x27;s shares to a split-adjusted price of $550. However, during the dot-com bust of 2000, Sapient&#x27;s shares dropped to a low of $0.75 per share. The shares reached a peak of $17.95 in 2014.

<text>Alfons Flisykowski (22 September 1902 – 5 October 1939) was a Polish worker of the Polish Post Office in the Free City of Danzig in the years 1923–1939 and a second commander (after Konrad Guderski) of the defence of the Post Office from the invading Nazi German forces when World War II started on 1 September 1939.

==Background==
Flisykowski was captured by the Germans on 2 September 1939 and handed over to the Gestapo. Denied the legitimate status of POW, he was put on trial (which was later found to be illegal), together with the other 37 captured post-office workers. Designated as a &quot;bandit&quot; by a paramilitary court (and therefore not protected by the Geneva Convention), he was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in Danzig-Saspe on 5 October 1939.

Flisykowski&#x27;s grave was discovered in 1991. In the same year the families of the killed postmen founded an association called Circle of the Families of the Former Workers of Gdańsk Post Office (&quot;Koło Rodzin Byłych Pracowników Poczty Gdańskiej&quot;) with a goal to repeal the verdict qualifying the postmen as bandits. With the help of Dieter Schenk, a former worker of Interpol and the author of a book on the subject, the case was put into a verification trial.

As a result of these actions the Land Court in Lübeck made a decision, on 30 December 1996, that the previous verdict of 1939 sentencing Flisykowski to death was illegal.

He was awarded the Cross of Valour posthumously on 1 September 1990.

<text>Vasileios &quot;Vasilis&quot; Leventis (, ; born 2 November 1951) is a Greek politician, leader of the Greek centrist party Union of Centrists () since 1992, and a Member of Parliament from 2015 to 2019.

==Early life==
Vassilis Leventis is the fourth child of Apostolos and Gregoria Leventis, who were originally from Korakovouni, a small village in Arcadia. The Leventis family moved to Piraeus, where Vassilis Leventis attended high school. In 1969 Leventis graduated from school and was admitted as the 6th highest-ranking candidate to the Civil Engineering department of the National Technical University of Athens. During the &#x27;70s he ventured into discography, funding and producing a one time record.

His first involvement with politics occurred in 1975 when, as an assistant of the then-dean of Athens Polytechnic University, Kyprianos Biris, he contributed to the composition of articles 21 and 24 of the Greek Constitution.

He is fluent in German and has an adequate understanding of the English language.

==Political career==
Vassilis Leventis began his political career in 1974 as a founding father of the PASOK, representing the party as a parliamentary candidate. In 1981, he expressed many disagreements with the party, blaming it for a divergence from its original views, and left it that year. In 1982, he was a candidate for mayor of Piraeus.

In 1984, he founded the first ecological party in Greece, which he named Eleftheroi (&quot;Free&quot;). This party participated in the European Parliamentary Elections of that year, gaining only 0.15% of the vote. In 1986, he stood for the office of mayor of Athens, gaining 0.57% of the vote.

In the national legislative election of 1989, Leventis was a candidate for New Democracy, but with 5,212 preference votes he ranked only 29th out of 31 candidates and was not elected. He moved on to establish the Ecologists Pacifists Greens in 1990, participating in the Greek parliamentary elections that same year, but again failed to be elected.

In 1992, Leventis collaborated with the Center-Democratic Party of Greece to form the Union of Centrists, which aimed to become &quot;the political continuance of the centrist expression in Greece&quot;. Leventis sought to embrace the legacy of several great politicians of the past, such as Georgios Papandreou and Eleftherios Venizelos. Until 2015 the party&#x27;s influence was marginal, with 1.79% of the total vote in the January 2015 legislative election being its highest share, which failed to secure it entry to parliament. In the September 2015 legislative election, however, the party cleared the 3% threshold in the Greek parliament for the first time after it won 186,457 votes (3.43%), electing 9 MPs.

==Television career==
In 1990, Leventis founded the television channel &quot;Channel 67&quot;, which was renamed in 1993 to &quot;Channel 40: Social and Ecological Television of Greece&quot; due to transfer of the channel&#x27;s frequency to 40 UHF. The channel was sold in late 2000 to publisher George Kouris, and was renamed &quot;Extra Channel&quot; on January 8, 2001; it was later sold again to entrepreneur Phillip Vriones and was renamed &quot;Extra Channel 3&quot; in August 2003. Leventis himself hosted a political show on the channel from 2000 to 2016, titled &quot;Politikos Marathonis&quot;, which was broadcast on a weekly basis.

==Political views==
Vasilis Leventis expresses his political opinion through his &quot;Antidiaplokí&quot; (Αντιδιαπλοκή, &quot;anti-corruption&quot;) quarterly newspaper and his TV show that has been hosted on several stations so far, such as PellaTV and Extra Channel.

His views are placed in the center of the political spectrum, with particular emphasis on policies that are &quot;rational&quot;, transparent, opposed to corruption, in favor of weaker social groups (workers, pensioners, farmers, single parents, etc.), hostile to the concentration of power in the hands of only a few individuals, and supportive of reform of Greek political life.

Leventis himself is unreservedly and often polemically critical of mainstream Greek political parties and their leaders. He asserts that Greek politicians are in league with big business interests who control the mainstream media, and as a result of this criticism he claims he has been deliberately excluded from publicity, which (in his opinion) is the factor that has caused his party to exist only at the margins of Greek politics. His frequent use of expletives and his animated style of speaking have led him to be the subject of jokes at his expense, but have also elevated some snippets of his TV shows to cult status.

Leventis proposes cutting double and triple pensions, cutting the pensions of those who have an income of 3,000 euro from other sources, firing 1,500 officials from Parliament, and sacking public workers who do not do their jobs.

Leventis&#x27;s general public profile rose in 2014 and 2015 due to a viral video montage detailing his so-called &quot;prophecies&quot;, which are said to have accurately predicted Greece&#x27;s current financial crisis from as far back as 1993.

<text>Elsipogtog First Nation (), formerly called the Big Cove Band, is a Miꞌkmaq First Nations band government in New Brunswick, Canada. The First Nation&#x27;s territory comprises Richibucto Reserve #15, lying southwest of Five Rivers, New Brunswick on the Richibucto River off of Route 116. It also comprises Soegao Reserve #35, lying west of Moncton, New Brunswick. , the registered Elsipogtog population is 3,574, with 2,736 living on reservations and 798 living off reservations.

==History==

&quot;Elsipogtog&quot; or &quot;L&#x27;sipuktuk&quot; means &quot;River of Fire&quot;. The area was also called the stronghold of Sikniktuk. The traditional district was assigned to the Mi&#x27;kmaq clan of Alguimou, or L&#x27;kimu. Misel Alguimou was baptised Michael Augustine in the 18th century. Chief Michael Augustine signed the Peace and Friendship Treaty with the British in 1761, on behalf of the Richibucto Tribe of Mi&#x27;kmaq. The Richibucto Reserve was established in 1802 and later reduced in size. Richibucto Reserve # 16 is also known as the Big Cove Reserve. It was also called Big Cove, Mesigig Oalnei, and currently known as Elsipogtog (Pacifique spelling), or L&#x27;sipuktuk (Francis-Smith variation) and Elsipogtog First Nation located in Weldford Parish, New Brunswick.

===Suicide rate===
In 1992, there were seven suicides involving youth and over 75 suicide attempts in the community. An inquest was held and one of the recommendations was the creation of a position at the school to help support the youth in the community. The Elsipogtog Crisis Centre was also established in 1992 to help combat the large number of suicides in the community.

===Youth justice system===
In 1995, the community held a Justice Awareness Day that led to the creation of a justice alternative for youth. This was due to the high youth suicide rate in Elsipogtog and the large percentage of their youth in the court system. The Elsipogtog Restorative Justice Program includes pre- and post-charge diversion system, mediation, group conferencing programs, and sentencing circles. The program allows the community to &quot;decide what [is] best for itself in terms of resolving wrongdoing...by striving to resolve the effects of an offender&#x27;s behaviour.

===Shale gas project===
In May 2013, members of Elsipogtog First Nation demonstrated their concern over a proposed shale gas project and 2D seismic imaging done near their reserve by SWN Resources Canada, a subsidiary of Southwestern Energy. Workers were on site to conduct seismic exploration using sound wave technology to create images of underground shale beds that might contain natural gas. Many residents used social media to voice their concerns about the planned fracking. Throughout the spring, summer, and fall of 2013, protesters prevented SWN workers from accessing their seismic equipment, blocking Routes 11, 116, and 134. On July 24, a video was recorded of a First Nations protester strapping herself to bundles of geophones and other equipment used by SWN for seismic testing at the site. She slowed down the workers&#x27; access to the equipment until the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) removed her later that day. On September 29, SWN&#x27;s trucks were blocked by a mystery van and protesters gathered in support. Shortly afterward, a sacred fire was lit and maintained by a 12-year-old boy who watched over the prayers of the people. On October 1, a video was recorded of Elsipogtog First Nation Chief Arren James Sock delivering an eviction notice to SWN while dozens of protesters continued to block Route 134 in Rexton to prevent the company from moving their exploration equipment.

On October 7, a video was recorded of Sock and New Brunswick premier David Alward addressing the media regarding the blockage of the shale gas research and the injunction regarding the blockade.

On October 17, the RCMP moved in to enforce a court injunction against the road blockade. The situation &quot;exploded in violence, sending dozens of people to jail and reducing five police cars to smouldering ruins&quot;. The incident was made famous in a now-iconic photograph of activist Amanda Polchies kneeling before the police and holding an eagle feather. The RCMP said that &quot;more than 40 protesters were arrested for various offences including firearms offences, uttering threats, intimidation, mischief and for refusing to abide by a court injunction&quot;. The First Nation&#x27;s lawyer, T.J. Burke, confirmed that Sock was among those arrested, though he and others were released within hours following their arrests. On October 18, SWN applied for an indefinite injunction against a list of people including John and Jane Doe. Judge Rideout denied this injunction. On November 29, another shale-gas protest resulted in the arrest of five men. Another report on the same day stated that fifteen protesters were jailed for throwing rocks at vehicles. Numerous arrests continued to occur into 2014.

==Present day==
The community has one school, Elsipogtog School, which has students from kindergarten to grade 8. Elsipogtog has a gas station, and a Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment which is open throughout the week. There is a 7 day/week supermarket and a Pharmasave-brand pharmacy, both of which are 100-percent band-owned and operated. There is also a holistic-approach health and wellness centre which has clinical and physician services available, as well as home and community care services, mental health, and addiction services. There are community justice services available.

===Kraft Hockeyville===

After a fire in September 2020 caused by the gang affiliated Christian Francis destroyed the community&#x27;s arena, the Chief Young Eagle, Elsipogtog entered Kraft Hockeyville, a Canada-wide competition held by Kraft Heinz Canada in collaboration with the National Hockey League (NHL) and the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA). The competition, which started in 2006, gives small communities in Canada a chance to win $250,000 in arena upgrades, $10,000 worth of youth hockey equipment, and the opportunity to host an NHL preseason game. Runners-up receive $25,000 in arena upgrades and $10,000 for youth hockey equipment.

On March 20, 2021, the NHL and NHLPA named four communities as finalists in the competition for 2021: Elsipogtog; Lumsden, Saskatchewan; Saint Adolphe, Manitoba; and Bobcaygeon, Ontario. Following two days of online voting, on April 10, 2021, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced Elsipogtog as the winner of the competition live on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. The win came a week after the tragic loss of two community members in a fishing accident, community leader Craig &#x27;Jumbo&#x27; Sock and Seth Monahan.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no NHL preseason was held in 2021, so Elsipogtog&#x27;s celebrations were delayed until October 2022 after restrictions had been lifted. Three days of activities were held. On the first day, an alumni game was held featuring former NHL players, including Elsipogtog native Everett Sanipass, as well as three female indigenous hockey players who have played for the Canadian and US national teams. Activities on the second day included autograph signings from various players, including New York Islanders legend Bryan Trottier, and a visit from the Stanley Cup. Mascots for the Ottawa Senators and Montreal Canadiens were also in attendance. Finally, on the third day, the preseason game between the Senators and Canadiens was held at the J.K. Irving Centre in Bouctouche. Goaltender Jake Allen, a native of Fredericton, New Brunswick, was in the lineup for the Canadiens. The Senators defeated the Canadiens 3–2 in overtime.

<doc id="538604" wikidata="Q323230" url="?curid=538604" title="Bill Mitchell (automobile designer)">
<text>William Leroy Mitchell (July 2, 1912 – September 12, 1988) was an American automobile designer. Mitchell worked briefly as an advertising illustrator and as the official illustrator of the Automobile Racing Club of America before being recruited by Harley Earl to join the Art and Color Section of General Motors in 1935.

Mitchell is responsible for creating or influencing the design of over 72.5 million automobiles produced by GM, including such landmark vehicles as the 1938 Cadillac Sixty Special, the 1949 Cadillac Coupe deVille, the 1955–1957 Chevrolet Bel Air, the 1959–1984 Cadillac DeVille, the 1963–1965 and 1966–1967 Buick Riviera, the 1961–1976 Corvette Stingray, the 1970–1981 Chevrolet Camaro, the 1976–1979 Cadillac Seville, and the 1980–1985 Cadillac Seville. Mitchell spent the entirety of his 42-year career in automobile design at General Motors, eventually becoming Vice President of Design, a position he held for 19 years until his retirement in 1977. His design stewardship at General Motors became known as the &#x27;Bill Mitchell era&#x27;.

==Early life and education==
Bill Mitchell was the son of a Buick dealer and developed a talent for sketching automobiles at an early age. He grew up in Greenville, Pennsylvania and New York City. Mitchell attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and later studied at the Art Students&#x27; League in New York, New York.

==At Barron Collier Advertising==
After completing art school, Mitchell joined the New York City based Barron Collier Advertising where he prepared layouts and advertising illustrations, including U.S. advertisements for MG cars. While working at the agency, Mitchell met brothers Barron Collier Jr., Miles Collier and Sam Collier, who had founded the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) (a forerunner of the Sports Car Club of America) in 1931. Mitchell became the official illustrator of the club and his sketches for the club eventually came to the attention of Harley Earl, then head of General Motors Art and Color Section.

==At General Motors Corporation==

===Art and Color Section===
Based on sketches Mitchell created as the official illustrator for the ARCA, Harley Earl recruited Mitchell to General Motors&#x27; then new Art and Color Section on December 15, 1935.

===Chief Designer, Cadillac===
In 1936 Earl appointed Mitchell as the Chief Designer in the then newly created Cadillac design studio.

===Director of Styling (under the Vice President of styling section)===
On May 1, 1954 Mitchell became General Motors Director of Styling under Harley Earl.

===Vice President, Styling Section (in charge of all styling at GM)===
In December 1958, Harley Earl reached GM&#x27;s mandatory retirement age of 65 and thus retired from his position as chief stylist. The 46-year-old Mitchell succeeded him as General Motors Vice President, Styling Section. Mitchell set out to break with the styling cues used under Harley Earl, wanting to eliminate chrome excess, fat fins and similar signature marks.

====1960s====
In the 60s, Mitchell promoted what he called the &quot;sheer look,&quot; a more aerodynamic, &quot;shoulderless&quot; drop off from a car&#x27;s windows to its sides.

Mitchell gave GM designers the assignment of combining Rolls-Royce and Ferrari styling cues to create Buick&#x27;s classic 1963 Riviera. According to a popular story, Mitchell got the idea for the Riviera in Paris. He had originally envisaged the design for Cadillac Division, as a new La Salle, &quot;a baby Cadillac&quot;. The Riviera also featured frameless glass in the front doors, giving hardtops an even sleeker look.

An encounter with a shark, while skin diving in the Bahamas, inspired Mitchell&#x27;s Corvette Shark show car, his Stingray racer and the production 1963 Corvette Stingray, largely designed by Larry Shinoda, under Mitchell&#x27;s direction. The designs for both the 1963 Corvette and the 1963 Riviera were accepted by their respective divisions on Christmas Eve 1961, in what Mitchell referred to as perhaps the greatest moment of his life.
Mitchell&#x27;s fondness for split rear windows as featured on the 1957 Buick and on the 1963 Corvette Stingray coupe was not shared by some of his fellow stylists or the buying public and both cars dropped the feature after a measure of public resistance. The split rear window would be eliminated (and re-worked into one pane of curved glass) for the 1964 Corvette coupe. The 1963-1967 Stingray (in both coupe and roadster editions), with its slightly bulged front and rear quarter-panels, would be one of the first General Motors cars to feature what came to be known as &quot;Coke bottle&quot; styling, creating an aggressive and muscular look.

Mitchell also influenced the dramatic styling of the second generation 1965 rear-engine Corvair, which, like other GM models introduced for that year, used curved side-window glass to enhance its &quot;Coke Bottle&quot; profile.

====1970s====
During the 1973–74 energy crisis, which brought on a greater demand for smaller cars in place of the larger cars that had been GM&#x27;s bread and butter profit machine for decades, Mitchell oversaw the styling and design efforts of GM&#x27;s downsized full-sized and intermediate-sized cars which were introduced in the late 1970s, some of the last designs that he would lead—and all largely based on themes first developed in his 1976 Cadillac Seville. However, when it came to compact and subcompact cars, Mitchell, who often struggled with alcoholism, reflected that &quot;Small cars are like vodka. Sure people will try them out but they won&#x27;t stay with them.&quot;

Mitchell stepped down as chief stylist in July 1977 following his 65th birthday. The last car he designed at GM was the 1977 Pontiac Phantom concept, which now resides at the Sloan Museum. He was also instrumental in the design of what would become the 1980–1985 Cadillac Seville. On August 1, 1977, Irv Rybicki succeeded Mitchell as Vice President of General Motors Design.

====1980s====
Following his retirement from General Motors, Mitchell ran William L. Mitchell Design, a private design-consulting firm, from 1977 to 1984. He was a vocal critic of the new fourth-generation Corvette&#x27;s styling, which he referred to as &quot;bland.&quot; Bill Mitchell died at the age of 76 from heart failure at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, on September 12, 1988.

==Awards and recognition==
Bill Mitchell was inducted into the Corvette Hall of Fame by the National Corvette Museum in 1998.

<text>Edward Walter Furlong (born August 2, 1977) is an American actor. He won Saturn and MTV Movie Awards for his breakthrough performance at age 13 as John Connor in James Cameron&#x27;s 1991 science fiction action film &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, which was followed by a mini-sequel, short attraction film &quot;T2-3D: Battle Across Time&quot;.

In 1992, he gave an Independent Spirit Award-nominated turn opposite Jeff Bridges in &quot;American Heart&quot;, and earned a second Saturn Award nomination for his work in &quot;Pet Sematary Two&quot;. He won a Young Artist Award for his performance alongside Kathy Bates in &quot;A Home of Our Own&quot; (1993) and appeared in &quot;Before and After&quot; (1996) with Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson. Furlong received acclaim for his starring roles in the 1998 motion pictures &quot;Pecker&quot;, co-starring Christina Ricci, and &quot;American History X&quot;, co-starring Edward Norton. He had significant roles in the comedy &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; (1999) and the crime drama &quot;Animal Factory&quot; (2000).

==Early life==
Edward Furlong was born August 2, 1977, in Glendale, California, the son of Eleanor Torres (née Tafoya), a youth-center worker, and Heinrich Bruno Wittig. Furlong is of Mexican descent on his mother&#x27;s side, and has also described himself as &quot;part Russian&quot;. Ms. Torres also had another child, who was born circa 1981 and is Edward&#x27;s maternal half brother.

Furlong never met his biological father, who died in June 1980 when Edward was two years old. He had a step-father during the early part of his childhood, Eleanor&#x27;s then-husband Moises Torres, but the couple&#x27;s marriage ended before Edward appeared in Terminator 2. 

His mother&#x27;s sister, Nancy Tafoya, and their half-brother, Sean Furlong, obtained custody of him for several years, including 1990-1991, when he began his acting career. Initially, the two served as Furlong&#x27;s managers.

==Career==
=== 1990s ===
In 1991, Furlong began his film career as John Connor in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, a role that earned him an MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Role and a Saturn Award for best young actor. He was discovered for the part by casting director Mali Finn while visiting the Pasadena Boys and Girls Club in September 1990.

He followed this role with a string of moderately successful high-profile films and independent films, sharing the screen with Meryl Streep and Liam Neeson in &quot;Before and After&quot; (1996); Tim Roth, Maximilian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave in &quot;Little Odessa&quot; (1995); Jeff Bridges in &quot;American Heart&quot; (1993); and Anthony Edwards and Clancy Brown in &quot;Pet Sematary Two&quot; (1992).

In 1993, he was featured in Aerosmith&#x27;s music video for &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot;. He played the lead role of Michael Brower, a horror and videogame-obsessed teen, in the sci-fi horror film &quot;Brainscan&quot; (1994). In 1995, he starred in the film adaptation of Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;The Grass Harp&quot;. He reprised his role as John Connor in the 1996 theme park ride &quot;T2-3D: Battle Across Time&quot; alongside Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick.

In 1998, he starred in &quot;American History X&quot; alongside Edward Norton and appeared in his first comedy role in &quot;Pecker&quot;, directed by John Waters. Of his title role in &quot;Pecker&quot;, Furlong stated, &quot;It&#x27;s true most of the characters that I&#x27;ve played so far are kind of like suicidal. Really dark roles, which I like. But I wanted to do something different and John gave me a chance to do that.&quot;

In 1998, he starred in the film &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;. During filming, he met Natasha Lyonne whom he then dated. He played a young convict in Steve Buscemi&#x27;s film &quot;Animal Factory&quot; (2000).

===2000s===

Furlong&#x27;s career and stardom declined considerably after 2000, with most of his subsequent films being released straight to DVD. In 2001 he took a lead role in the medieval drama &quot;I Cavalieri che fecero l&#x27;impresa aka The Knights of the Quest&quot;, a little-seen film by Italian filmmaker Pupi Avati. He was expected to play John Connor again in &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (2003); however the role was recast and given to Nick Stahl shortly before filming began. When speaking about the history of his substance abuse and its effects on his career Furlong has said that he had been hired to reprise his role in Terminator 3, in what would have been a very lucrative deal for him, but was removed by the producers after an overdose incident which violated the terms of his contract.

In 2004, he appeared in a music video for Metallica&#x27;s &quot;The Unnamed Feeling&quot;, and played Jimmy in the low budget independent film &quot;Jimmy &amp; Judy&quot; (2004), during which time he met Rachael Bella. The two became romantically involved and later married. He played the eponymous lead in the superhero film franchise &quot;The Crow&#x27;s&quot; fourth film, &quot;The Crow: Wicked Prayer&quot; (2005), co-starring with David Boreanaz and Tara Reid. The film was initially planned for a theatrical release but was widely panned by critics and audiences, and was released to DVD after running for one week in limited theaters. He appeared in &quot;Night of the Demons&quot;, the 2009 remake of the 1988 horror classic, which was shot in New Orleans and released straight to DVD.

In 2006 and again in 2010, he appeared in five episodes of the television program &quot;&quot; as Shane Casey.

===2010s===

Furlong appeared in two scenes of Seth Rogen&#x27;s film &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; (2011). Next he starred in &quot;This Is Not a Movie&quot;, an English-language Mexican film written and directed by Olallo Rubio and co-starring Peter Coyote and Edi Gathegi. He was featured as Fixer in the crowdfunded pilot &quot;Star Trek: Renegades&quot;.

In 2019, James Cameron confirmed that Furlong would be returning to reprise his role of John Connor. It was later reported that his facial likeness would be used via CGI in &quot;&quot; (2019) with Jude Collie as a CGI stand-in, and he was involved in one day of filming for facial capture performance, as John Connor was killed off in the opening scene.

===2020s===

In 2023 Furlong appeared in the movie &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Horse/Heart of a Champion&quot; and in &quot;The Forest Hills&quot;, which was a crowdfunded project mostly shot in 2023 and released in 2024, with Shelley Duvall and Dee Wallace. In 2024 Furlong starred in the Lovecraftian horror film &quot;Unspeakable: Beyond the Wall of Sleep&quot;, shot and released that year.

===Other work===
In October 1992, Furlong released a pop-music album in Japan, titled &quot;Hold on tight&quot;, which included a cover of &quot;People Are Strange&quot; by the Doors.

==Personal life==
When Furlong was 16 he was openly in a relationship with his sometime stand-in and tutor, 29-year-old Jacqueline Domac, whom he had met on Terminator 2 when he was 13. The two eventually began living together. When California&#x27;s statutory rape law was changed in 1994 to allow the prosecution of adult women who have sex with minors, his uncle Sean Furlong filed a complaint against Domac alleging statutory rape of his nephew, but was unsuccessful in having Domac prosecuted. In May 1999, Domac sued Edward Furlong for domestic violence and for 15 percent of his earnings in the previous three years, including his pay for &quot;Pecker&quot; and &quot;American History X&quot;, which she claimed that she was owed because she had worked for Furlong as his manager.

Furlong married the actress Rachael Bella on April 19, 2006. The couple had a son, born in September 2006. On July 8, 2009, Bella filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. Later in 2009, she sought to dissolve the restraining order she had previously filed, so that Furlong could visit their child. In 2012, Bella alleged in court documents that their six-year-old son had tested positive for cocaine, which led a judge to rule Furlong&#x27;s visits must be supervised. 

===Substance abuse and legal problems===

Furlong has battled alcoholism in particular and drug addiction in general throughout his career. He first went into rehab in October 2000. In 2006, Furlong stated he was &quot;on and off&quot; hard drugs from ages 22 to 26 and added that &quot;I was a heroin and cocaine addict. It was really scary. [...] I don&#x27;t even think about (partying) anymore. It seems lonely now: Running and clubbing and doing coke. I have nightmares about doing hard drugs. I&#x27;ll wake up and I&#x27;m like, &#x27;Did I relapse? 

In September 2009, Bella filed a restraining order against Furlong after he allegedly punched her while in a drug-fueled frenzy. In 2010, he received three years of probation for violation of the civil protective order obtained by Bella. 

In October 2012, Furlong was arrested and charged with felony domestic violence against his girlfriend Monica Keena. In November 2012, he was arrested for allegedly assaulting Keena. In January 2013, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor battery against Keena and arraigned on an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for a December 12 misdemeanor domestic violence charge also involving Keena. In March 2013, he was sentenced to 180 days in jail for a violation of probation after he &quot;used force&quot; against his ex-girlfriend, and for violation of a protective order, prohibiting approach and contact with Keena. 
He was arrested again in May 2013 for assaulting his girlfriend and avoided a further prison sentence after agreeing to five years&#x27; probation, 90 days rehab for drug addiction, and one year of domestic violence counseling. He had spent 61 days in jail.

===Rehabilitation and reconciliation ===

After his arrest in 2013, Furlong committed to rehabilitation. 

In February 2021, he reunited with his &quot;American History X&quot; co-star, Ethan Suplee, on Suplee&#x27;s podcast &quot;American Glutton&quot; to discuss Furlong&#x27;s recovery from drug addiction and compulsive eating. At the time of publication, he was three years sober from alcohol and illegal substances. Speaking on his initial hesitation to maintain sobriety, he said, &quot;I genuinely was afraid of facing what I would be without all that, because I carried all that as who I was&quot;.

<text>The Vermont Republic, officially known at the time as the State of Vermont, was an independent state in New England that existed from January 15, 1777, to March 4, 1791. The state was founded in January 1777, when delegates from 28 towns met and declared independence from the jurisdictions and land claims of the British colonies of Quebec, New Hampshire, and New York. The republic remained in existence for the next fourteen years, albeit without diplomatic recognition from any foreign power. On March 4, 1791, it was admitted into the United States as the State of Vermont, with the constitution and laws of the independent state continuing in effect after admission.

The delegates forbade adult slavery within their republic, although the Vermont constitution continued to make allowances for the enslavement of men under the age of 21 and women under the age of 18. Many Vermonters took part in the American Revolution on the side of the Revolution, but the Continental Congress did not recognize the independence of Vermont (then also known as the New Hampshire Grants) due to objections from New York, which had conflicting property claims. In a response to this, members representing Vermont conducted negotiations to join the Province of Quebec, which were accepted by the British, who offered generous terms for the republic&#x27;s reunion. When the British surrendered at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, however, American independence became apparent. Vermont, later bordered on three sides by U.S. territory, ended negotiations with Britain and instead negotiated terms to become part of the United States.

Many of its citizens favored political union with the United States rather than full independence. While the Continental Congress did not allow a seat for Vermont, Vermont engaged William Samuel Johnson, representing Connecticut, to promote its interests. In 1785 the Vermont General Assembly granted Johnson title to the former King&#x27;s College Tract as a form of compensation for representing Vermont.

== Name ==
The constitution and other official documents referred to the country as the &quot;State of Vermont&quot;. The 1777 constitution refers to Vermont variously: the third paragraph of the preamble, for example, mentions &quot;the State of Vermont&quot;, and in the preamble&#x27;s last paragraph, the constitution refers to itself as &quot;the Constitution of the Commonwealth&quot;. The currency used by the country, the Vermont copper, carried the legend that read , which in Latin means: .

Prior to June 2, 1777, it was also known as the Republic of New Connecticut, and the Republic of the Green Mountains.

==History==


After 1724, the Province of Massachusetts Bay built Fort Dummer near Brattleboro, as well as three other forts along the northern portion of the Connecticut River to protect against raids by Native Americans farther south into Western Massachusetts. After 1749, Benning Wentworth, the Royal Governor of New Hampshire, granted land to anyone in a land-granting scheme designed to enrich himself and his family. After 1763, settlement increased because of easing security concerns after the end of the French and Indian Wars. The Province of New York had made grants of land, often in areas overlapping similar grants made by the Province of New Hampshire; this issue had to be resolved by the King in 1764, who granted the land to New York, but the area was popularly known as the New Hampshire Grants. The &quot;Green Mountain Boys&quot;, led by Ethan Allen, was a militia force from Vermont that supported the New Hampshire claims and fought against the British during the American Revolution.

==Founding==
Following controversy between the holders of the New York grants and the New Hampshire grants, Ethan Allen and his militia of &quot;Green Mountain Boys&quot; suppressed Loyalists. On January 15, 1777, a convention of representatives from towns in the territory declared the region independent, choosing the name the Republic of New Connecticut (although it was sometimes known colloquially as the Republic of the Green Mountains). On June 2 of that year, the name was officially changed to &quot;Vermont&quot; (from the French, , meaning the Green Mountains) upon the suggestion of Thomas Young, a member of the Sons of Liberty, a Boston Tea Party leader, and mentor to Ethan Allen.

John Greenleaf Whittier&#x27;s poem &quot;The Song of the Vermonters, 1779&quot; describes the period in ballad form. First published anonymously, the poem had characteristics in the last stanza that were similar to Ethan Allen&#x27;s prose and caused it to be attributed to Allen for nearly 60 years. The last stanza reads:

On August 20, 1781, the Confederation Congress of the United States passed resolutions saying it would not consider admitting that state to the Union unless Vermont would renounce its claims to territory east of the Connecticut River and west of Lake Champlain.

==Constitution and frame of government==
The Constitution of Vermont was drafted and ratified at Elijah West&#x27;s Windsor Tavern in 1777. The settlers in Vermont, who sought independence from New York, justified their constitution on the same basis as the first state constitutions of the former colonies: authority is derived from the people. As historian Christian Fritz notes in &quot;American Sovereigns: The People and America&#x27;s Constitutional Tradition before the Civil War&quot;:
The Vermont constitution was modeled after the radically democratic constitution of Pennsylvania on the suggestion of Young, who worked with Thomas Paine and others on that 1776 document in Philadelphia.

During its time as an independent state, the government issued its own coinage and currency and operated postal service. The currency was known as the Vermont copper, and its mint was operated by Reuben Harmon in East Rupert from 1785 to 1788. The chief executive of the state was referred to as the governor.

The governor of Vermont, Thomas Chittenden, with consent of his council and the General Assembly, appointed commissioners to the American government seated in Philadelphia. Vermont engaged in diplomatic negotiations with the United States, the Netherlands, and France.

After a combined British-Mohawk force raided several Vermont settlements in the 1780 Royalton Raid, Ethan Allen led a group of Vermont politicians in secret discussions with Frederick Haldimand, the Governor General of the Province of Quebec, about returning Vermont to British rule.

===Symbolism of fourteen===
Much of the symbolism associated with Vermont in this period expressed a desire for political union with the United States. Vermont&#x27;s coins minted in 1785 and 1786 bore the Latin inscription &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;the fourteenth star&quot;). The Great Seal of Vermont, designed by Ira Allen, centrally features a 14-branched pine tree.

==Union==
On March 6, 1790, the legislature of New York consented to Vermont statehood, provided that a group of commissioners representing New York and a similar group representing Vermont could agree on the boundary. Vermont&#x27;s negotiators insisted on also settling the real-estate disputes rather than leaving those to be decided later by a federal court. On October 7, the commissioners proclaimed the negotiations successfully concluded, with an agreement that Vermont would pay $30,000 to New York to be distributed among New Yorkers who claimed land in Vermont under New York land patents. The Vermont General Assembly then authorized a convention to consider an application for admittance to the &quot;Union of the United States of America&quot;. The convention met at Bennington, on January 6, 1791. On January 10, 1791, the convention approved a resolution to make an application to join the United States by a vote of 105 to 2. Vermont was admitted to the Union by 1 Stat. 191 on March 4, 1791. Vermont&#x27;s admission act is the shortest of all state admissions, and Vermont is &quot;the only state admitted without conditions of any kind, either those prescribed by the Congress or the state from which it was carved&quot;. March 4 is celebrated in Vermont as Vermont Day.

The North, the smaller states, and states concerned about the impact of the sea-to-sea grants held by other states, all supported Vermont&#x27;s admission. Thomas Chittenden served as governor for Vermont for most of this period and became its first governor as a member state of the United States.

The 1793 Vermont state constitution made relatively few changes to the 1786 Vermont state constitution, which had, in turn, succeeded the 1777 constitution. It retained many of its original ideas, as noted above, and kept the separation of powers. It remains in force with several amendments.

<text>Kongo or Kikongo is one of the Bantu languages spoken by the Kongo people living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Republic of the Congo, Gabon, and Angola. It is a tonal language. The vast majority of present-day speakers live in Africa. There are roughly seven million native speakers of Kongo in the above-named countries. An estimated five million more speakers use it as a second language.

Historically, it was spoken by many of those Africans who for centuries were taken captive, transported across the Atlantic, and sold as slaves in the Americas. For this reason, creolized forms of the language are found in ritual speech of Afro-American religions, especially in Brazil, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Suriname. It is also one of the sources of the Gullah language, which formed in the Low Country and Sea Islands of the United States Southeast. The Palenquero creole in Colombia is also related to Kong creole.

==Geographic distribution==
Kongo was the language of the Kingdom of Kongo prior to the creation of Angola by the Portuguese Crown in 1575. The Berlin Conference (1884-1885) among major European powers divided the rest of the kingdom into three territories. These are now parts of the DRC (Kongo Central and Bandundu), the Republic of the Congo, and Gabon.

Kikongo is the base for the Creole language Kituba, also called &quot;Kikongo de l&#x27;État&quot; and &quot;Kikongo ya Leta&quot; (French and Kituba, respectively, for &quot;Kikongo of the state administration&quot; or &quot;Kikongo of the State&quot;). 

The constitution of the Republic of the Congo uses the name &quot;Kituba&quot;, and Democratic Republic of the Congo uses the term &quot;Kikongo&quot; (i.e. Kikongo ya Leta).This can be explained by the fact that Kikongo ya Leta is often mistakenly called Kikongo (i.e. KiNtandu, KiManianga, KiNdibu, etc.).

Kikongo and Kituba are spoken in:
* South of Republic of the Congo:
** Kikongo (Yombe, Vili, Ladi, Sundi, etc.) and Kituba:
*** Kouilou,
*** Niari,
*** Bouenza,
*** Lékoumou,
*** south of Brazzaville,
*** Pointe-Noire,
** Kikongo (Ladi, Kongo Boko, etc.):
*** Pool;
* South-west of Democratic Republic of the Congo:
** Kikongo (Yombe, Ntandu, Ndibu, Manyanga, etc.) and Kikongo ya Leta:
*** Kongo Central,
*** a part of Kinshasa,
** Kikongo ya Leta:
*** Kwilu,
*** Kwango,
*** Mai-Ndombe,
*** far west Kasaï;
* North of Angola:
** Kikongo (Kisikongo, Zombo, Ibinda, etc.):
*** Cabinda,
*** Uíge,
*** Zaire,
*** north of Bengo and north of Cuanza Norte; 
* South-West of Gabon.
** Kikongo (Vili):
*** Nyanga,
*** Ngounié

=== Presence in the Americas ===
Many African slaves transported in the Atlantic slave trade spoke Kikongo. Its influence can be seen in many creole languages in the diaspora, such as:
*Brazil
**Cupópia
***Salto de Pirapora
*Colombia
**Palenquero
***San Basilio de Palenque
*Cuba
**Habla Congo/Habla Bantu
***None; liturgical language of the Afro-Cuban Palo religion.
*Haiti
**Haitian Creole
***Haiti
***Bahamas
***Cuba
***Dominican Republic
***United States
**Langaj
***None; liturgical language of the Haitian Vodou religion.
*Suriname
**Saramaccan language
***Boven Suriname
***Brokopondo
***Paramaribo
***French Guiana
***Netherlands
*United States
**Gullah
***Gullah-Geechee Corridor (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida)
**Louisiana Creole
***Louisiana; and neighboring states.

== People ==
Prior to the Berlin Conference, the people called themselves &quot;Bisi Kongo&quot; (plural) and &quot;Mwisi Kongo&quot; (singular). Today they call themselves &quot;Bakongo&quot; (pl.) and &quot;Mukongo&quot; (sing.).

== Writing ==
Kongo was the earliest Bantu language to be written in Latin characters. Portuguese created a dictionary in Kongo, the first of any Bantu language. A catechism was produced under the authority of Diogo Gomes, who was born in 1557 in Kongo to Portuguese parents and became a Jesuit priest. No version of that survives today.

In 1624, Mateus Cardoso, another Portuguese Jesuit, edited and published a Kongo translation of the Portuguese catechism compiled by Marcos Jorge. The preface says that the translation was done by Kongo teachers from São Salvador (modern Mbanza Kongo) and was probably partially the work of Félix do Espírito Santo (also a Kongo).

The dictionary was written in about 1648 for the use of Capuchin missionaries. The principal author was Manuel Robredo, a secular priest from Kongo (after he became a Capuchin, he was named Francisco de São Salvador). The back of this dictionary includes a two-page sermon written in Kongo. The dictionary has some 10,000 words.

In the 1780s, French Catholic missionaries to the Loango coast created additional dictionaries. Bernardo da Canecattim published a word list in 1805.

Baptist missionaries who arrived in Kongo in 1879 (from Great Britain) developed a modern orthography of the language.

American missionary W. Holman Bentley arranged for his &quot;Dictionary and Grammar of the Kongo Language&quot; to be published by the University of Michigan in 1887. In the preface, Bentley gave credit to Nlemvo, an African, for his assistance. He described &quot;the methods he used to compile the dictionary, which included sorting and correcting 25,000 slips of paper containing words and their definitions.&quot; Eventually W. Holman Bentley, with the special assistance of João Lemvo, produced a complete Christian Bible in 1905.

The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has published a translation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Fiote.

== Standardisation ==
The work of English, Swedish and other missionaries in the 19th and 20th centuries, in collaboration with Kongo linguists and evangelists such as Ndo Nzuawu Nlemvo (or Ndo Nzwawu Nlemvo; Dom João in Portuguese) and Miguel NeKaka, marked the standardisation of Kikongo. 

==Linguistic classification==
Kikongo belongs to the Bantu language family.

According to Malcolm Guthrie, Kikongo is in the language group H10, the Kongo languages. Other languages in the same group include Bembe (H11). &quot;Ethnologue&quot; 16 counts Ndingi (H14) and Mboka (H15) as dialects of Kongo, though it acknowledges they may be distinct languages.

Bastin, Coupez and Man&#x27;s classification of the language (as Tervuren) is more recent and precise than that of Guthrie on Kikongo. The former say the language has the following dialects:

*Kikongo group H16
**Southern Kikongo H16a
**Central Kikongo H16b
**Yombe (also called Kiyombe) H16c
**Fiote H16d
**Western Kikongo H16d
**Bwende H16e
**Ladi (Lari) H16f
**Eastern Kikongo H16g
**Southeastern Kikongo H16h

NB: Kisikongo is not the protolanguage of the Kongo language cluster. Not all varieties of Kikongo are mutually intelligible (for example, 1. Civili is better understood by Kiyombe- and Iwoyo-speakers than by Kisikongo- or Kimanianga-speakers; 2. Kimanianga is better understood by Kikongo of Boko and Kintandu-speakers than by Civili or Iwoyo-speakers).

== Phonology ==


# The phoneme can occur, but is rarely used.
# May also be heard as a nasal sound.
There is contrastive vowel length. /m/ and /n/ also have syllabic variants, which contrast with prenasalized consonants.

== Grammar ==

=== Noun classes ===
Kikongo has a system of 18 noun classes in which nouns are classified according to noun prefixes. Most of the classes go in pairs (singular and plural) except for the locative and infinitive classes which do not admit plurals.

NB: Noun prefixes may or may not change from one Kikongo variant to another (e.g. class 7: the noun prefix &quot;ci&quot; is used in civili, iwoyo or ciladi (lari) and the noun prefix &quot;ki&quot; is used in kisikongo, kiyombe, kizombo, kimanianga...).

=== Conjugation ===

NB: Not all variants of Kikongo have completely the same personal pronouns and when conjugating verbs, the personal pronouns become stressed pronouns (see below and/or the references posted).

Conjugating the verb (&quot;mpanga&quot; in Kikongo) to be (&quot;kukala&quot; or &quot;kuba&quot;; also &quot;kuena&quot;, &quot;kwena&quot; or &quot;kuwena&quot; in Kikongo) in the present:

Conjugating the verb (&quot;mpanga&quot; in Kikongo) to have (&quot;kuvua&quot; in Kikongo; also &quot;kuba na&quot; or &quot;kukala ye&quot;) in the present :

NB: In Kikongo, the conjugation of a tense to different persons is done by changing &quot;verbal prefixes&quot; (highlighted in bold). These &quot;verbal prefixes&quot; are also personal pronouns. However, not all variants of Kikongo have completely the same verbal prefixes and the same verbs (cf. the references posted). The ksludotique site uses several variants of Kikongo (kimanianga...).

== Vocabulary ==


=== English words of Kongo origin ===
* The Southern American English word &quot;goober&quot;, meaning peanut, comes from Kongo &quot;nguba&quot;.
* The word funk, or funky, in American popular music has its origin, some say, in the Kongo word &quot;Lu-fuki&quot;.
* The name of the Cuban dance &quot;mambo&quot; comes from a Bantu word meaning &quot;conversation with the gods&quot;.
In addition, the roller coaster Kumba at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida gets its name from the Kongo word for &quot;roar&quot;.
* The word chimpanzee

==Sample text==
According to Filomão CUBOLA, article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Fiote translates to: 
:&quot;Bizingi bioso bisiwu ti batu bambutukanga mu kidedi ki buzitu ayi kibumswa. Bizingi-bene, batu, badi diela ayi tsi-ntima, bafwene kuzingila mbatzi-na-mbatzi-yandi mu mtima bukhomba.&quot;
:&quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

<doc id="538635" wikidata="Q642283" url="?curid=538635" title="Al-Khayzuran">
<text>Al-Khayzuran bint Atta () (died 789) was the wife of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Mahdi and mother of both Caliphs Al-Hadi and Harun al-Rashid. She maintained de facto influence from 775 to 789 during the reign of her husband and sons and is known for her immense influence on state affairs.

al-Khayzuran was not formally a ruler, but was nevertheless the first woman in the history of Islam to rule de facto and was the first woman in the history of Muslims to have gold coins in her name. She became one of the most powerful women of her time under the name of her husband and sons, al-Mahdi, al-Hadi and al-Harun. During the reign of al-Mahdi, al-Khayzuran often appeared at the court when the caliph was present and also used great political power, and caliph sought her views on most matters before issuing orders.

Al-Khayzuran was also the first woman to have her own bureaucracy and court and accept petitions and the audience of officials and the people, and to command and forbid in the caliphate. Independent of the state treasury, she gained enormous wealth by having extensive trade relations with other countries. While al-Mahdi spent most of his time hunting and having fun, she, by influencing the court, was able to hold meetings in her house to run the caliphate. Even after his death, she continued to wield premier power and influence during her sons&#x27; time.

At the time of al-Mahdi&#x27;s untimely death, al-Khayzuran in the capital (Baghdad) had already taken over government affairs and by hiding his death and paying the salaries of army officers, she secured the allegiance of the soldiers for her son al-Hadi as the new caliph, but al-Hadi opposed his mother in sharing and partnership unquestionable power in the caliphate, and al-Khayzuran killed him after severe disputes. She brought Harun al-Rashid to power. Unlike his brother, al-Harun did not oppose his mother and officially handed over all power to his mother and relied upon his mother&#x27;s advice.

==Life==
Al-Khayzuran was born in Jorash, near modern Bisha, Saudi Arabia. She was kidnapped from her home by a Bedouin who then sold her in a slave market near Mecca to Al-Mahdi during his pilgrimage. Officially it was illegal for Muslims to enslave Muslims, however all sources are nevertheless adamant that she was a slave, and to break the official rule barring the enslavement of Muslims was not an unusual in practice in that context.

=== Reign of Al-Mahdi ===

Al-Khayzuran was described as beautiful, intelligent and gifted. At that time the woman slaves of the harem, called &quot;jarya&quot; or &quot;jawari&quot;, were famed for educating themselves in music, singing, astrology, mathematics and theology in order to keep their master&#x27;s interest, and Al-Khayzuran took regular lessons in &quot;fiqh&quot; from the most learned qadis.

She eventually became the favorite of Al-Mahdi. Upon his succession as caliph in 775, she convinced him to free and marry her; depriving his first wife, Princess Rayta (daughter of Caliph Al-Saffah) of her privileges as well as demoting her son from the position of heir to the throne. Instead, Al-Mahdi name Al-Khayzuran&#x27;s sons as his heirs, despite the fact that it went against custom for the sons of a slave to be so named. As a queen, al-Khayzuran now held supreme authority over the caliph&#x27;s harem; even the caliph had to behave in this area according to her wishes. She quickly took over the management of this complex institution, from social life to the planning of parties and ceremonies, including the management of the large sums of money that come in.

From that point on, she was the most powerful and influential woman in the empire, accompanying Al-Mahdi whenever he held court. She hidden behind a curtain, and if she did not agree with something, she would place her hand on his back out of sight. Al-Khayzuran had direct access to the caliph at all times: her suggestions were always adopted, individuals she recommended were favored and promoted, and at her intercession he forgave enemies or commuted death sentences.
At court she was allied with the Barmakids. During Al-Mahdi&#x27;s reign, Al-Khayzuran held an extraordinary and unusual degree of power for anyone, let alone a woman: she discussed and helped decide all military and state affairs, she was not secluded in the harem, her influence over al-Mahdi allowed her to exercise political power outside of the harem over everyone and anything or everywhere, she met petitioners, both men and women, who asked her for favors or to intercede on their behalf with her husband, the caliph. These petitioners included court officials, military officers, nobles, and merchants, and she had her own court where she held audiences with generals, politicians and officials in her chambers, mixing with men and discussing state affairs or they passed her petitions of the state in envelopes. Al-Mahdi even allowed her to meet with foreign ambassadors and sign official papers for the administration of the empire. All these measures were innovations considered culturally inappropriate for a woman, underscoring her influence and power throughout the empire.

Al-Khayzuran&#x27;s palace, like the caliph&#x27;s, was guarded by soldiers and her lands spread past the outskirts of the capital, and she also ran a number of enterprises and factories through agents who reported directly to her, she also had a large business abroad and the much merchants and nobles of the capital and its suburbs depended on her; she owned hundreds of slaves, had many female attendants, and commanded a luxurious lifestyle. Her annual income was one-third that of the caliphate, which amount doubled during the caliphates of her sons Al-Hadi and Harun al-Rashid, and accounted for more than half of the caliphate&#x27;s total income. As her husband aged, her power at court grew, and she even awarded some of her relatives with positions. While al-Mahdi was campaigning in the west and north or he traveled to around the empire for sightseeing, she managed affairs in Baghdad on his behalf. She also summoned her mother, two sisters and two brothers to court, married her sister Salsal to Prince Ja&#x27;far, and named her brother Ghatrif Governor of Yemen.

In addition to their two sons the couple also had a daughter named Banuqa. Al-Mahdi loved her so much that he had her dressed as a boy, so she could accompany him on his travels. When she died at age 16, her father caused a scandal by demanding public condolences, which was not deemed correct for a daughter.

One time when Khaizuran was in her flat encircled by other imperial women, a servant notificed her that Muznah, the widow of Marwan II, the last Umayyad caliph, was at the door. Muznah was impoverished and her story and situation moved Khaizuran&#x27;s heart so much that she arranged for her to be provided for. When Khaizuran and Mahdi had dinner together that evening, she notified him what had happened. Mahdi praised her charity, and Muznah enjoyed royal patronage until her death in subsequent reign.

=== Reign of Musa al-Hadi ===
In 785, Al-Mahdi died during an expedition with his son Harun, who rushed back to Baghdad to inform her. Her two sons were also absent from the city, and to secure the succession for her son, she called upon the viziers and ordered them to pay the wages of the army to secure order, and then had them swear allegiance to her son as their new Caliph in his absence.

Al-Khayzuran reportedly wished to continue to engage in politics during the reign of her son: &quot;Khayzuran wanted to dominate her son as she had previously dominated his father, al-Mahdi.&quot;
She continued to give audiences in her chambers and discuss state affairs during the reign of her son Al-Hadi: 
:&quot;She continued to monopolize decision-making without consulting him [al-Hadi], Khayzuran in the first part of Hadi’s reign used to settle his affairs and to deal with him as she had dealt with his father before him in assuming absolute power to command and forbid. She in the first part of Hadi’s reign, behaved as she had before... . During the reign of al-Mahdi people came and went through her door, and she settled the affairs of the state.&quot;

Al-Hadi, however, opposed her participation in state affairs, and he was not inclined to allow displays of authority by her and attempted to exclude her from them, reportedly saying: &quot;it is not in the power of women to intervene .. . in matters of sovereignty. Look to your prayers and your prayer beads.&quot;
He disapproved of the fact that his mother gave audiences to supplicants, politicians, officials and generals and conferred with them and thus mixed with men, which he considered improper, and he publicly addressed the issue of his mothers public life by assembling his generals and asked them: 
:&#x27;Who is the better among us, you or me?&#x27; asked Caliph al-Hadi of his audience. 
:&#x27;Obviously you are the better, Commander of the Faithful,&#x27; the assembly replied.
:&#x27;And whose mother is the better, mine or yours?&#x27; continued the caliph.
:&#x27;Your mother is the better, Commander of the Faithful.&#x27;
:&#x27;Who among you&#x27;, continued al-Hadi, &#x27;would like to have men spreading news about your mother?&#x27;
:&#x27;No one likes to have his mother talked about,&#x27; responded those present.
:&#x27;Then why do men go to my mother to speak to her?&#x27;
Until this time period, Muslim women had not yet been fully secluded from society in a harem, but the harem system was to become fully institutionalized in the Islamic world under the Abbasid caliphate, when the Abbasid harem was established.

Despite his opposition, Al-Hadi did not manage to disturb his mother&#x27;s extraordinary authority base, and she refused to retire from politics into the harem. The conflict was finally exposed in public when she interceded in favor of a supplicant, Abdallah ibn Malik, and publicly demanded a reply from her son, who lost his temper and openly yelled at her and said: 
:&quot;Wait a moment and listen well to my words ... . Whoever from among my entourage - my generals, my servants - comes to you with a petition will have his head cut off and his property confiscated. What is the meaning of those retinues that throng around your door every day? Don&#x27;t you have a spindle to keep you busy, a Koran for praying, a residence in which to hide from those besieging you? Watch yourself, and woe to you if you open your mouth in favour of anyone at all.&quot;

Al-Khayzuran is rumored to have had her eldest son Al-Hadi murdered after this incident. One reason given is that she learned that he was planning to kill his brother Harun al-Rashid, another that he attempted to poison her himself, which she discovered after first allowing her dog to eat of the dish he had sent to her. One version claims that she gave the task of killing him to one of his slave concubines, or &quot;jawari&quot;, to suffocate him with cushions.

=== Reign of Harun al-Rashid ===
Her second son, caliph Harun al-Rashid, in contrast to his brother, did not oppose to his mother participating in the affairs of state, but instead openly acknowledged her political ability and publicly trusted her advice, and governed the realm by her side. He was proud to point out that there was no reason for him to be ashamed of sharing his power with a woman, if she had such ability and brilliance as Al-Khayzuran.

Though it is difficult to say exactly in which issues she pressed her policy, it is nevertheless acknowledged that she participated in the decision making that formed the policy of the Caliphate. And at this time Al-Khayzuran retained all the powers of the empire and actually ruled instead of the caliph. She also legitimized her full-scale authority over her son by an old and popular saying &quot;a mother&#x27;s right is God&#x27;s right&quot;.

:&quot;The histories do not detail Khayzuran&#x27;s political achievements, but coins were struck in her name, palaces were named for her, and the cemetery in which subsequent Abbasid rulers were laid to rest carries her name, all testifying not only to status but also to civic largesse.&quot;

When she died in 789, her son broke the rules which demanded that he show no sorrow, and instead publicly demonstrated his sorrow and participated in her funeral, which attracted much attention.

==Family==
Al-Khayzuran was the mother of caliphs Musa al-Hadi and Harun al-Rashid. She had another son named Isa, and a daughter named Banuqah or Banujah. She was born in Mecca and brought up in Jurash. She had two sisters, Salsal and Asma, and a brother Ghitrif. She was al-Mahdi&#x27;s favourite wife. 

In her parental home she had a brother named Ghitrif ibn Atta, two daughters of Ghitrif; Ubaidah and Azizah married Al-Khayzuran two son Musa and Harun respectively. Thus her two nieces became his daughter-in-laws too.

==Legacy==
Al-Khayzuran and her strong personality is believed by many literary historians to be a key influence on Scheherazade, the main character in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. Many of the stories were influenced by Harun al-Rashid and his fabulous court.

Al-Khayzuran was the second and last woman in the caliphate&#x27;s history, who was the mother of more than one caliph (mother of two caliphs). The first woman was Wallāda, who was the mother of both Umayyad caliphs; al-Walid I and Sulayman.

<doc id="538644" wikidata="Q637846" url="?curid=538644" title="Upper house">
<text>An upper house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller and often has more restricted power than the lower house. A legislature composed of only one house (and which therefore has neither an upper house nor a lower house) is described as unicameral.

==Definite specific characteristics==
An upper house is usually different from the lower house in at least one of the following respects (though they vary among jurisdictions):

Powers:
*In a parliamentary system, it often has much less power than the lower house. Therefore, in certain countries the upper house:
**votes on only limited legislative matters, such as constitutional amendments,
**cannot initiate most kinds of legislation, especially those pertaining to supply/money, fiscal policy,
**cannot vote a motion of no confidence against the government (or such an act is much less common), while the lower house always can.
*In a presidential system:
**It may have equal or nearly equal power with the lower house.
**It may have specific powers not granted to the lower house. For example:
***It may give advice and consent to some executive decisions (e.g. appointments of cabinet ministers, judges or ambassadors).
***It may have the sole power to try (but not necessarily initiate) impeachment cases against officials of the executive or even judicial branch, following enabling resolutions passed by the lower house.
***It may have the sole power to ratify treaties.
*In a semi-presidential system:
**It may have less power than the lower house.
***In semi-presidential France, the Government can decide to legislate a normal law without the &#x27;s agreement (Article 45 of the constitution), but...
**It may have equal power to the lower house regarding the constitution or the territorial collectivities. 
**It may not vote a motion of no confidence against the government, but it may investigate State cases.
**It may make and propose bills for consideration by the lower house.

Status:
*In some countries, its members are not popularly elected; membership may be indirect, ex officio or by appointment.
*Its members may be elected with a different voting system than that used to elect the lower house (for example, upper houses in Australia and its states are usually elected by proportional representation, whereas lower houses are usually not).
*Less populated states, provinces, or administrative divisions may be better represented in the upper house than in the lower house; representation is not always intended to be proportional to population.
*Members&#x27; terms may be longer than in the lower house and may be for life.
*Members may be elected in portions, for staggered terms, rather than all at one time.
*In some countries, the upper house cannot be dissolved at all, or can be dissolved only in more limited circumstances than the lower house.
*It typically has fewer members or seats than the lower house (though notably not in the United Kingdom parliament).
*It has usually a higher age of candidacy than the lower house.

==Powers==

===Parliamentary systems===
In parliamentary systems the upper house is frequently seen as an advisory or a &quot;house of review&quot; chamber; for this reason, its powers of direct action are often reduced in some way. Some or all of the following restrictions are often placed on upper houses:

*Lack of control over the executive branch. (By contrast, in the US and many other presidential systems, the Senate or upper chamber has more control over the composition of the Cabinet and the administration generally, through its prerogative of confirming the president&#x27;s nominations to senior offices.)
*No absolute veto of proposed legislation, though suspensive vetoes are permitted in some states.
*In countries where it &quot;can&quot; veto legislation (such as the Netherlands), it may not be able to amend the proposals.
*A reduced or even absent role in initiating legislation.
*No power to block &quot;supply&quot;, or budget measures. (A rare example of a parliamentary upper house that does possess this power is the Australian Senate, which notably exercised that power in 1975.)

In parliamentary democracies and among European upper houses the Italian Senate is a notable exception to these general rules, in that it has the same powers as its lower counterpart: any law can be initiated in either house and must be approved in the same form by both houses. Additionally, a Government must have the consent of both to remain in office, a position which is known as &quot;perfect bicameralism&quot; or &quot;equal bicameralism.&quot;

The role of a revising chamber is to scrutinise legislation that may have been drafted over-hastily in the lower house and to suggest amendments that the lower house may nevertheless reject if it wishes to. An example is the British House of Lords. Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the House of Lords can no longer prevent the passage of most bills, but it must be given an opportunity to debate them and propose amendments, and can thereby delay the passage of a bill with which it disagrees. Bills can only be delayed for up to one year before the Commons can use the Parliament Act, although economic bills can only be delayed for one month. 

The House of Lords is sometimes seen as having a special role of safeguarding the uncodified Constitution of the United Kingdom and important civil liberties against ill-considered change. 

The House of Lords has a number of ways to block legislation and to reject it; however, the House of Commons can eventually use the Parliament Act to force something through. The Commons will often accept amendments passed by the Lords; however, the two houses have sometimes reached a constitutional standoff. For example, when the Labour Government of 1999 tried to expel all hereditary peers from the Lords, the Lords threatened to wreck the Government&#x27;s entire legislative agenda and to block every bill which was sent to the chamber. This standoff led to negotiations between Viscount Cranborne, the then Shadow Leader of the House, and the Labour Government, resulting in the Weatherill Amendment to the House of Lords Act 1999, which preserved 92 hereditary peers in the house. Compromise and negotiation between the two houses make the Parliament Act a very rarely used backup plan.

Even without a veto, an upper house may defeat legislation. Its opposition may give the lower chamber a chance to reconsider or even abandon a controversial measure. It can also delay a bill so that it does not fit within the legislative schedule, or until a general election produces a new lower house that no longer wishes to proceed with the bill.

Nevertheless, some states have long retained powerful upper houses. For example, the consent of the upper house to legislation may be necessary (though, as noted above, this seldom extends to budgetary measures). Constitutional arrangements of states with powerful upper houses usually include a means to resolve situations where the two houses are at odds with each other.

In recent times, parliamentary systems have tended to weaken the powers of upper houses relative to their lower counterparts. Some upper houses have been fully abolished; others have had their powers reduced by constitutional or legislative amendments. Also, conventions often exist that the upper house ought not to obstruct the business of government for frivolous or merely partisan reasons. These conventions have tended to harden with a passage of time.

===Presidential systems===
In presidential systems, the upper house is frequently given other powers to compensate for its restrictions:

*Executive appointments, to the cabinet and other offices, usually require its approval.
*It frequently has the sole authority to give consent to ratify and abrogate foreign treaties.

==Institutional structure==
There are a variety of ways an upper house&#x27;s members are assembled: by direct or indirect election, appointment or a mixture of these. Many upper houses are not directly elected but appointed: either by the head of state, by the head of government or in some other way. This is usually intended to produce a house of experts or otherwise distinguished citizens, who would not necessarily be returned in an election. For example, members of the Senate of Canada are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister.

In the past, some upper houses had seats that were entirely hereditary, such as in the British House of Lords until 1999 and in the Japanese House of Peers until it was abolished in 1947.

It is also common that the upper house consists of delegates chosen by state governments or local officials. Members of the Rajya Sabha in India are nominated by various states and union territories, while 12 of them are nominated by the President of India. Similarly, at the state level, one-third of the members of the State Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad) are nominated by local governments, one-third by sitting legislators, and the rest are elected by select members of the electorate. The United States Senate was chosen by state legislatures until the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913.

The upper house may be directly elected but in different proportions to the lower house - for example, the senates of Australia, Brazil and the United States have a fixed number of elected members from each state, regardless of the population.

==Abolition==

Many jurisdictions once possessed upper houses but abolished them to adopt unicameral systems, including Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Mauritania, New Zealand, Peru, Sweden, Turkey, Venezuela, many Indian states, Brazilian states, Canadian provinces, subnational entities such as Queensland, and some other jurisdictions. Newfoundland had a Legislative Council prior to joining Canada, as did Ontario when it was Upper Canada and Quebec from 1791 (as Lower Canada) to 1968.

Nebraska is the only state in the United States with a unicameral legislature, having abolished its lower house in 1934, while the Senate of Nebraska, the upper house prior to 1934, continues to assemble.

The Australian state of Queensland also once had an appointed Legislative Council before abolishing it in 1922. All other Australian states continue to have bicameral systems, though all members are now directly elected (the two self-governing territories, along with Norfolk Island until 2016, have always been unicameral).

Like Queensland, the German state of Bavaria had an appointed second chamber, the Senate of Bavaria, from 1946 to 1999.

The Senate of the Philippines was abolished – and restored – twice: from 1935 to 1945 when a unicameral National Assembly convened, and from 1972 to 1987 when Congress was closed, and later a new constitution was approved instituting a unicameral Parliament. The Senate was re-instituted with the restoration of a bicameral Congress via a constitutional amendment in 1941, and via adoption of a new constitution in 1987.

A previous government of Ireland (the 31st Dáil) promised a referendum on the abolition of its upper house, the Seanad Éireann, during the 24th Seanad session. By a narrow margin, the Irish public voted to retain it. Conservative-leaning Fine Gael and Left-leaning Sinn Féin both supported the abolition, while the centrist Fianna Fáil was alone among major parties in supporting the retention of the Seanad.

<doc id="538663" wikidata="Q7601887" url="?curid=538663" title="Stargazy pie">
<text>Stargazy pie (Cornish: &quot;Hogen Ster-Lagatta&quot;; sometimes called starrey gazey pie, sometimes spelt stargazey pie or starry gazey pie) is a Cornish dish made of baked pilchards (sardines), along with eggs and potatoes, covered with a pastry crust. Although there are a few variations using other types of fish, the unique feature of stargazy pie is fish heads (and sometimes tails) protruding through the crust, so that they appear to be gazing to the stars.

The dish traditionally originates from the village of Mousehole in Cornwall and is traditionally eaten during the festival of Tom Bawcock&#x27;s Eve to celebrate his heroic catch during a very stormy winter. According to the modern festival, which is combined with the Mousehole village illuminations, the entire catch was baked into a huge stargazy pie, encompassing seven types of fish and saving the village from starvation. The story of Bawcock was popularised by Antonia Barber&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;The Mousehole Cat&quot;, which featured the stargazy pie. In 2007 contestant Mark Hix won the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Great British Menu&quot; with a variant of the dish.

==Description==
Stargazy pie is a pastry-based fish pie which, by tradition, is filled with whole pilchards. It is critical that the pilchards retain their heads, so they poke through the pastry top. The appearance of the fish heads makes them look like they are &quot;gazing at the stars&quot;, hence the name. The position of the fish allows the oil that is released during cooking to drain into the pie, adding a fuller flavour and ensuring the pie is moist. The celebrity chef Rick Stein suggested also poking the pilchards&#x27; tails through the pie crust to give the effect of leaping through water.

In spite of the fact that the British Food Trust describes the dish as being fun as well as amusing to children, it has been listed in &quot;Yuck! Disgusting things people eat&quot;, a lifestyle feature by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; based upon the book by an American author, Neil Setchfield. On Tom Bawcock&#x27;s Eve it is served in The Ship Inn, the only pub in Mousehole, sometimes after a re-enactment of the legend.

==Origins==

The pie originates from the fishing village of Mousehole in Cornwall. As with many parts of Cornish heritage, a legend has appeared about its origins. In this case, the pie is served to celebrate the bravery of Tom Bawcock, a local fisherman in the 16th century. The legend explains that one winter had been particularly stormy, meaning that none of the fishing boats had been able to leave the harbour. As Christmas approached, the villagers, who relied on fish as their primary source of food, were facing starvation.

On 23 December, Tom Bawcock decided to brave the storms and went out in his fishing boat. Despite the stormy weather and the difficult seas, he managed to catch enough fish to feed the entire village. The entire catch (including seven types of fish) was baked into a pie, which had the fish heads poking through to prove that there were fish inside. Ever since then, the Tom Bawcock&#x27;s Eve festival is held on 23 December in Mousehole. The celebration and memorial to the efforts of Tom Bawcock sees the villagers parading a huge stargazy pie during the evening with a procession of handmade lanterns, before eating the pie itself.

An older feast, held by the fishermen towards the end of December, included a pie cooked with different fish to represent the variety of catches the men hoped to achieve in the coming year. There is a possibility that Tom Bawcock&#x27;s Eve is an evolution of this festival. Since 1963, the festival has been run against the backdrop of the Mousehole village illuminations, where the entire harbour is lit up, along with many other displays. One set of lights even represents the pie itself, showing fish heads and tails protruding from a pie dish underneath six stars.

There was a rumour that the entire festival was a fabrication by the landlord of The Ship Inn in the 1950s. However, festivities had been recorded by Morton Nance, an author on the Cornish language, in 1927 in the magazine &quot;Old Cornwall&quot;. His description was regarding the festivities prior to 1900, though he doubted the reality of Tom Bawcock, suggesting it was in fact &quot;Beau Coc&quot;. He also went on to confirm that the origins of the festival dated back to pre-Christian times, though it is unclear at what time the stargazy pie became part of the festivities. Morton Nance went on to restore the traditional song sung on Tom Bawcock&#x27;s Eve, played to the local tune &quot;wedding March&quot;.

A legend surrounding stargazy pie, along with the other unusual pies of Cornwall, is that they were the reason that the Devil never came to Cornwall. In his book &quot;Popular Romances of the West of England; or, The drolls, traditions, and superstitions of old Cornwall&quot;, a collection of Cornish traditions, Robert Hunt explains that the Devil crossed the River Tamar to Torpoint. The chapter, entitled &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Coits, etc&quot;, reasons that the Devil discovered the Cornish would put anything in a pie and decided to leave before they took a fancy to a &quot;devilly&quot; pie, returning to Devon.

==Recipes==

The original pie in the legend included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring is used as a substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, while pilchards or herring can be added for the presentation. Prior to putting it in the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) to make it easier to eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.

There are many recipe variations around the traditional ingredients, some of which include hard-boiled eggs, bacon, onion, mustard or white wine. Other alternatives to the main fish can be crayfish and rabbit or mutton. The stargazy pie is always topped with a pastry lid, generally shortcrust but sometimes puff pastry, through which the fish heads and sometimes tails protrude.

For presentation, one suggestion is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward the centre of the pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.

==In popular culture==
Nancy Kerr and James Fagan recorded an album and track &quot;Starry Gazy Pie&quot; in 1997.

Jim Causley references &quot;starry-gazey pie&quot; on the track &quot;My Young Man&#x27;s a Cornishman&quot; on his 2013 album &quot;Cyprus Well&quot;. The song comes from a poem by his distant relative Charles Causley (1917–2003).

The Silver Seas made an album called “Starry Gazey Pie” in 2004.

Cornish singer Brenda Wootton recorded an album &quot;Starry-Gazey Pie&quot; with Rob Bartlett in 1975 for Sentinel Records.

Stargazy pie features in the 2004 film &quot;Ladies in Lavender&quot;.

He was educated at the universities of Halle, Heidelberg and Berlin, where in 1871 he qualified as a lecturer in geology. From 1873 he worked as a state geologist for the &quot;Preußischen Geologischen Landesanstalt&quot; (Prussian Geological Survey), and in 1881 became a professor at the Berlin Mining Academy. In 1885 he succeeded Wilhelm Dunker as professor of geology and paleontology at the University of Marburg.

He is known for his work involving the stratigraphy, tectonics and paleontology of Paleozoic formations in Germany; especially the Harz and the Rhenish Massif. With Wilhelm Dames, he was co-editor of the journal &quot;Paläontologischen Abhandlungen&quot;.

Among his separate works are &quot;Lehrbuch der Geologie&quot; (2 vols.): ii. &quot;Geologische Formationskunde&quot; (1891; 2nd ed., 1902), and i. &quot;Allgemeine Geologie&quot; (1893); vol. ii. (the volume first issued) was translated and edited by Philip Lake, under the title &quot;Textbook of Comparative Geology&quot; (1893). Another work is &quot;Beiträge zur Kenntniss der Fauna der Siegenschen Grauwacke&quot; (1892).
