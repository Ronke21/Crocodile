<text>Jan Mølby (; born 4 July 1963) is a Danish former professional footballer and manager. As a player, he was a midfielder from 1982 to 1998. After starting his career with Kolding, he moved on to Ajax before spending twelve years playing in England with Liverpool. He was capped 33 times by Denmark, scoring twice.

After leaving Liverpool he became player-manager of Swansea City, where he spent two years, and then managed Kidderminster Harriers, guiding them to promotion to the Football League in 2000. He later had a brief spell as manager of Hull City and then a brief spell back in charge of Kidderminster Harriers.

==Club career==
Born in Kolding, Mølby started his senior playing career at Kolding, the biggest football club of his hometown, where he became team captain at the age of 18, before joining Ajax on 1 July 1982, where he won the Dutch Championship and the Dutch Cup (the double) in the 1982–83 season.

Liverpool manager Joe Fagan invited Mølby to have a ten-day trial and finally signed him on 22 August 1984. He made his debut three days later on 26 August in the 3–3 league draw with Norwich City at Carrow Road. His first goal for Liverpool came on 1 December 1984 in the 3–1 league defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He failed to shine for Liverpool in his first season as the team endured a comparatively poor season, failing to win a major trophy for the first time since 1975.

In 1985–86, new player-manager Kenny Dalglish put faith in Mølby, installing him as a regular in the first team. On a number of occasions, Mølby began matches as a third central defender or deep-lying sweeper, before moving into midfield alongside Steve McMahon, often with devastating effect, as the match wore on. He scored 21 goals in 1985–86 from midfield in what was undoubtedly his best season. The season culminated in a man of the match performance in the first-ever all Merseyside FA Cup final playing a part in all three Liverpool goals.

Having lost the league title to Liverpool a week earlier, derby rivals Everton were looking for revenge and took a 1–0 lead into the half-time break, courtesy of a Gary Lineker strike. After the break Liverpool, led by Mølby, began to make inroads into the Blues&#x27; defence. In the 57th minute he set up the equaliser for Ian Rush and followed that up six minutes later by setting up Craig Johnston to take the lead. Mølby was also involved in the third goal, when Rush latched on to a chipped pass from Ronnie Whelan to put the final out of Everton&#x27;s reach and complete the double.

Mølby also began to establish himself as a regular and successful penalty taker around this time, starting with two penalties converted at home to Tottenham Hotspur in the league on 28 September 1985. Other fine performances included a brace in open play in a 3–0 home win over Aston Villa in the league on 7 December, and two goals (one a penalty) as they eliminated Manchester United from the Football League Cup in a 2–1 win at Anfield in late November. 

He remained a regular in the team in 1986–87, in which Liverpool finished second in the League. During their League Cup run, which ended with a 2–1 defeat at Wembley against Arsenal, he scored a hat-trick of penalties in a fourth round replay at Anfield against Coventry City. Mølby scored another penalty against Coventry in a league match at Anfield the following Saturday.

During pre-season training in the summer of 1987, Mølby suffered a foot injury, which turned out to be a crucial turning point in his career. He missed the first three months of the 1987–88 season, and with the arrival of John Barnes to play on the left wing, Mølby&#x27;s place in central midfield was taken by Ronnie Whelan (who had hitherto played left midfield). Whelan&#x27;s partnership with McMahon proved a great success and, although Whelan was himself injured later in the season, Mølby&#x27;s return to fitness came too late to resume his place in midfield, which went to Nigel Spackman for the rest of the season. He was never again an automatic choice in midfield under Dalglish as Whelan and McMahon became the first choice partnership.

In 1988–89, Mølby returned to regular first team football, playing in central defence in the absence of the injured Alan Hansen, and scoring the winning goal against Manchester United at Anfield in the second league game of the season. However, in October 1988 he was sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment for reckless driving following an incident earlier in the year. The club decided to stand by him, and he returned to the first team in January 1989 in Hansen&#x27;s continued absence, but suffered another injury in March which kept him out for the rest of the season. In April 1989, Mølby, along with his teammates, rallied round the bereaved families of the Hillsborough disaster attending a number of the funerals.

In the following season, 1989–90 (Liverpool&#x27;s last title-winning season before winning again in the 2020 season), Mølby was a frustrated figure, unable to command a first team place despite often impressing during his occasional appearances. He started only 12 of 38 league games, although he enjoyed a successful return to the team in the championship run-in, deputising for the injured Whelan.

The following season threatened more of the same for Mølby, as he was again a regular substitute. In September 1990, before an away league match against Everton, Radio 5 commentator Mike Ingham remarked that &quot;Mølby&#x27;s still only a substitute even though he&#x27;d probably walk into any other first division team&quot;. Later that season, after Liverpool had knocked Brighton out of the FA Cup, Brighton manager Barry Lloyd expressed bemusement in a BBC post-match interview that Mølby was not being selected regularly. Mølby was very close to signing for Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Barcelona in November 1990, after a fee had been agreed of £1.6 million and he had agreed a four-year contract. When he scored a penalty in a 4–0 home win over Luton Town, it was expected to be his farewell to the Liverpool fans. However, this was followed by a breakdown in negotiations and he remained at Anfield. It would be more than five years before he finally did leave the club.

Another injury to Whelan in a home league game against Everton in February 1991 gave Mølby another chance to re-establish himself, and he enjoyed his longest run of matches for four years. He once again became the club&#x27;s regular penalty taker that season, scoring from all eight of his spot-kicks. However, after injury to McMahon and the surprise resignation of Dalglish, Liverpool could only finish runners-up in the league, despite having won their first nine matches of the campaign.

After initially extolling Mølby&#x27;s virtues, new manager Graeme Souness changed his mind early in the 1991–92 season, leaving Mølby out as Whelan and McMahon again started in midfield. However, after Whelan suffered another injury, he turned to Mølby, who went on to feature heavily in the Liverpool side that season, starring in the UEFA Cup and playing an important part in their FA Cup winning season.

After suffering an injury in a 2–2 Premier League draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 18 October 1992, Mølby&#x27;s career began to decline. He had suffered from fluctuating weight for most of his career, routinely gaining weight when injured and unable to train. This led to longer recovery periods being required, so his injuries generally led to an absence of at least three months. Over the first three Premier League seasons (Mølby&#x27;s last), he started just over 30 games in total and all his goals came from penalties, including one in Liverpool&#x27;s first game of the 1994–95 season when Mølby opened the scoring with a penalty in a 6–1 away win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.

Early in the 1995–96 season, manager Roy Evans loaned him out to Barnsley and Norwich (where he scored once in the League Cup against Birmingham City), and in February 1996, he finally called time on more than a decade at Liverpool to take over as player-manager of Swansea City. Just before taking the job at the Vetch Field, Ron Atkinson unsuccessfully tried to sign him for Coventry City. At that stage, still only 32, he was the youngest manager of any Football League or Premier League club.

While at Liverpool, he scored a total of 62 goals, 42 of which were from penalties. During Mølby&#x27;s time with Liverpool, he only failed to score three times from the penalty spot (penalties against Sheffield Wednesday and QPR in 1985–86 and Chelsea in 1989–90 were saved). His record as a penalty-taker in the top flight is thought to be second only to Matthew Le Tissier. He held the club record of most penalties scored by a Liverpool player until Steven Gerrard surpassed his record in August 2014.

==International career==
Mølby made his debut in the Danish international side at the age of 18, against Norway on 15 June 1982. He won 33 caps for Denmark from 1982 to 1990, scoring two goals. He was a squad player (appearing generally as a substitute) with the Danish international side which competed in the 1984 European Championship and 1986 World Cup. Competition for places in the Danish midfield often saw Mølby overlooked in favour of Frank Arnesen and Jens-Jørn Bertelsen.

Jan Mølby&#x27;s international career came to an end when Richard Møller Nielsen took over as Denmark manager in 1990. The new national manager only used Mølby in two games – both in 1990. Once as a substitute in a friendly against Wales and later in the starting line-up in the 2–0 home defeat against Yugoslavia in the qualification for the Euro 1992.

==Managerial career==
Mølby became manager of Swansea City in February 1996 but was sacked in October 1997 along with his assistant, Billy Ayre. He had taken Swansea to the Division Three playoff final five months earlier, but they lost to a last-minute goal by Northampton Town&#x27;s John Frain. A dismal start to the 1997–98 season had seen Swansea struggling near the foot of the Football League, and the board decided that it was time for a new manager to be appointed, asserting that the team&#x27;s good performances the previous season were more down to Mølby&#x27;s qualities as a top class player, rather than as a manager.

No offers of managerial jobs were forthcoming for some time. Pursuing a career as a TV pundit, Mølby was finally offered the manager&#x27;s job at Kidderminster Harriers, then in the Football Conference. He took over in April 1999. Utilising the existing squad of players, but adding his own in a few key positions (ex-Liverpool teammate Mike Marsh was drafted in to great success) Harriers won the Conference title (and promotion to the Football League) in Mølby&#x27;s first season in charge.

Two seasons of decent Division Three form followed, before overtures from Hull City prompted Mølby&#x27;s departure for East Yorkshire. His tenure was brief however, as internal strife cast a shadow over his brief term in charge. A return to Kidderminster in October 2003 was unsuccessful, ending with his resignation a year later. Kidderminister were relegated back to the Conference that season and have yet to reclaim their Football League place.

Following Kenny Jackett&#x27;s resignation as Swansea manager in early 2007, Mølby was linked with a return to the club. However, Mølby has responded by saying that he is unlikely to ever return to football management.

==Recent years==
In April 2009, Mølby was made an &#x27;Honorary Scouser&#x27; by the Lord Mayor of Liverpool.

Mølby appears on a podcast called &quot;Mølby on the Spot&quot; presented by Trevor Downey from a field in rural Ireland.

A running gag of comedian Troy Hawke (Milo McCabe) as he performs as a street greeter is that he was sent by Mølby, the “non-consensual CEO of the Greeter’s Guild.&quot; The two men met at the public unveiling of a Mølby mural in Liverpool in March 2023.

<text>ID3 is a metadata container most often used in conjunction with the MP3 audio file format. It allows information such as the title, artist, album, track number, and other information about the file to be stored in the file itself.

ID3 is a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for metadata in MP3 files; no standardization body was involved in its creation nor has such an organization given it a formal approval status. It competes with the APE tag in this area.

There are two unrelated versions of ID3: ID3v1 and ID3v2. In ID3v1, the metadata is stored in a 128-byte segment at the end of the file. In ID3v2, an extensible set of &quot;frames&quot; located at the start of the file is used. Sub-variants of both versions exist.

==ID3v1==
When the MP3 standard was published in 1995, it did not include a method for storing file metadata. In 1996 Eric Kemp proposed adding a 128-byte suffix to MP3 files, which would store useful information such as an artist&#x27;s name or a related album title. Kemp deliberately placed the tag data (which is demarcated with the 3-byte string ) at the end of the file as it would cause a short burst of static to be played by older media players that did not support the tag. The method, now known as ID3v1, quickly became the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for storing metadata in MP3s despite internationalization and localization weaknesses arising from the standard&#x27;s use of ISO-8859-1 system of encoding rather than the more globally compatible Unicode.

The v1 tag allows 30 bytes each for the title, artist, album, and a &quot;comment&quot;, 4 bytes for the year, and 1 byte to identify the genre of the song from a predefined list of values.

===ID3v1.1===
In 1997, a modification to ID3v1 was proposed by Michael Mutschler in which two bytes formerly allocated to the comment field were used instead to store a track number so that albums stored across multiple files could be correctly ordered. The modified format became known as ID3v1.1.

=== ID3v1.2 ===
In 2002 or 2003, BirdCage Software proposed ID3v1.2, which enlarged many of the fields from 30 to 60 bytes and added a sub-genre field while retaining backward compatibility with v1.1 by placing its new &quot;enhanced&quot; tag in front of a standard v1.1 tag. Adoption of ID3v1.2 was limited.

== ID3v2 ==
In 1998, a new specification called ID3v2 was created by multiple contributors. Although it bears the name ID3, its structure is completely distinct from that of ID3v1. ID3v2 tags are of variable size and are usually placed at the start of the file, which enables metadata to load immediately, even when the file as a whole is loading incrementally during streaming. 

A ID3v2 tag consists of a number of optional &quot;frames&quot;, each of which contains a piece of metadata up to 16 MB in size. For example, a frame may be included to contain a title. The entire tag may be as large as 256 MB, and strings may be encoded in Unicode.

===ID3v2.2===
The first public variant of v2, ID3v2.2, used three character frame identifiers rather than four (TT2 for the title instead of TIT2). It is considered obsolete.

===ID3v2.3===
ID3v2.3 is the most widely used version of ID3v2 tags and is widely supported by Windows Explorer and Windows Media Player. Notably it introduced the ability to embed an image such as an album cover.

===ID3v2.4===
ID3v2.4 was published on November 1, 2000. It defines 83 frame types, allows text frames to contain multiple values separated with a null byte, and permits the tag to be stored at either the beginning or the end of the file.

==Notable features==
===Chapters===
An ID3v2 Chapter Addendum was published in December 2005. It allows users to jump easily to specific locations or chapters within an audio file and can provide a synchronized slide show of images and titles during playback. Typical use-cases include Enhanced podcasts and it can be used in ID3v2.3 or ID3v2.4 tags.

===Lyrics===
Lyrics3v1 and Lyrics3v2 were tag standards implemented before ID3v2, for adding lyrics to mp3 files. The difference with ID3v2 is that Lyrics3 is always at the end of an MP3 file, before the ID3v1 tag.

== Editing ID3 tags ==

ID3 tags may be edited in a variety of ways. Specialized applications, called tag editors, enable precise editing of all fields or frames and permit sophisticated batch editing, but many audio players provide native editing of common fields or frames. Some file managers also provide tag editing capabilities. 

== Non-MP3 implementation ==
ID3 tags were designed for the MP3 format, but the tagsets are an independent part of the MP3 file and can be used elsewhere. ID3v2 tags are sometimes used with AIFF and WAV files, and 
MP4 allows the embedding of an ID3 tag.

<doc id="539920" wikidata="Q7336208" url="?curid=539920" title="Risk-free bond">
<text>A risk-free bond is a theoretical bond that repays interest and principal with absolute certainty. The rate of return would be the risk-free interest rate. It is primary security, which pays off 1 unit no matter state of economy is realized at time formula_1. So its payoff is the same regardless of what state occurs. Thus, an investor experiences no risk by investing in such an asset.

In practice, government bonds of financially stable countries are treated as risk-free bonds, as governments can raise taxes or indeed print money to repay their domestic currency debt.

For instance, United States Treasury notes and United States Treasury bonds are often assumed to be risk-free bonds. Even though investors in United States Treasury securities do in fact face a small amount of credit risk, this risk is often considered to be negligible. An example of this credit risk was shown by Russia, which defaulted on its domestic debt during the 1998 Russian financial crisis.

==Modelling the price by Black-Scholes model==
In financial literature, it is not uncommon to derive the Black-Scholes formula by introducing a continuously rebalanced &quot;risk-free portfolio&quot; containing an option and underlying stocks. In the absence of arbitrage, the return from such a portfolio needs to match returns on risk-free bonds. This property leads to the Black-Scholes partial differential equation satisfied by the arbitrage price of an option. It appears, however, that the risk-free portfolio does not satisfy the formal definition of a self-financing strategy, and thus this way of deriving the Black-Sholes formula is flawed.

We assume throughout that trading takes place continuously in time, and unrestricted borrowing and lending of funds is possible at the same constant interest rate. Furthermore, the market is frictionless, meaning that there are no transaction costs or taxes, and no discrimination against the short sales. In other words, we shall deal with the case of a &quot;perfect market&quot;.

Let&#x27;s assume that the &quot;short-term interest rate&quot; formula_2 is constant (but not necessarily nonnegative) over the trading interval formula_3. The risk-free security is assumed to continuously compound in value at the rate formula_2; that is, formula_5. We adopt the usual convention that formula_6, so that its price equals formula_7 for every formula_8. When dealing with the Black-Scholes model, we may equally well replace the savings account by the &quot;risk-free bond&quot;. A unit zero-coupon bond maturing at time formula_9 is a security paying to its holder 1 unit of cash at a predetermined date formula_9 in the future, known as the bond&#x27;s &quot;maturity date&quot;. Let formula_11 stand for the price at time formula_12 of a bond maturing at time formula_9. It is easily seen that to replicate the payoff 1 at time formula_9 it suffices to invest formula_15 units of cash at time formula_16 in the savings account formula_17. This shows that, in the absence of arbitrage opportunities, the price of the bond satisfies

formula_18

Note that for any fixed T, the bond price solves the ordinary differential equation

formula_19

We consider here a &quot;risk-free&quot; bond, meaning that its issuer will not default on his obligation to pat to the bondholder the face value at maturity date.

== Risk-free bond vs. Arrow-Debreu security ==
The risk-free bond can be replicated by a portfolio of two Arrow-Debreu securities. This portfolio exactly matches the payoff of the risk-free bond since the portfolio too pays 1 unit regardless of which state occurs. This is because if its price were different from that of the risk-free bond, we would have an &quot;arbitrage opportunity&quot; present in the economy. When an arbitrage opportunity is present, it means that riskless profits can be made through some trading strategy. In this specific case, if portfolio of Arrow-Debreu securities differs in price from the price of the risk-free bond, then the arbitrage strategy would be to buy the lower priced one and sell short the higher priced one. Since each has exactly the same payoff profile, this trade would leave us with zero net risk (the risk of one cancels the other&#x27;s risk because we have bought and sold in equal quantities the same payoff profile). However, we would make a profit because we are buying at a low price and selling at a high price. Since arbitrage conditions cannot exist in an economy, the price of the risk-free bond equals the price of the portfolio.

== Calculating the price ==
The calculation is related to an Arrow-Debreu security. Let&#x27;s call the price of the risk-free bond at time formula_16 as formula_21. The formula_22 refers to the fact that the bond matures at time formula_22. As mentioned before, the risk-free bond can be replicated by a portfolio of two Arrow-Debreu securities, one share of formula_24 and one share of formula_25.

Using formula for the price of an formula_26 Arrow-Debreu securities

formula_27

which is a product of ratio of &quot;the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution&quot; (the ratio of marginal utilities across time, it is also referred to as the &quot;state price density&quot; and &quot;the pricing kernel&quot;) and &quot;the probability&quot; of state occurring in which the Arrow-Debreu security pays off 1 unit. The price of the portfolio is simply

formula_28

formula_29

Therefore, the price of a risk-free bond is simply the expected value, taken with respect to the probability measure formula_30, of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution. The interest rate formula_2, is now defined using the reciprocal of the bond price.

formula_32

Therefore, we have the fundamental relation

formula_33

that defines the interest rate in any economy.

== Example ==
Suppose that the &quot;probability of state 1&quot; occurring is 1/4, while &quot;probability of state 2&quot; occurring is 3/4. Also assume that &quot;the pricing kernel&quot; equals 0.95 for state 1 and 0.92 for state 2.

Let the pricing kernel denotes as formula_34 . Then we have two Arrow-Debreu securities formula_35 with parameters

formula_36

formula_37

Then using the previous formulas, we can calculate the bond price

formula_38

The interest rate is then given by

formula_39

Thus, we see that the pricing of a bond and the determination of interest rate is simple to do once the set of Arrow-Debreu prices, the prices of Arrow-Debreu securities, are known.

<text>Stormont Castle is a manor house on the Stormont Estate in east Belfast which is home to the Northern Ireland Executive and the Executive Office. It is a Grade A listed building.

==History==
Stormont Castle was completed c.1830 and was reworked in 1858 by its original owners, the Cleland family, to the designs of Thomas Turner in the Scottish baronial style with features such as bartizans used for decorative purposes. The building and of adjoining land was bought by the newly established Government of Northern Ireland for £15,000 in 1921.

Between 1921 and 1972, it served as the official residence of the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. However, a number of Prime Ministers chose to live at Stormont House, the official residence of the Speaker of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, which was empty as a number of Speakers had chosen to live in their own homes. It also served as the meeting place for the Cabinet of the Government of Northern Ireland from 1921 to 1972.

With the imposition of direct rule in 1972, it served as the Belfast headquarters of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland Office (NIO) ministers and supporting officials. During The Troubles, it was also used by MI5 officers. The Good Friday Agreement was concluded in nearby Castle Buildings in April 1998.

A £7.5m renovation was completed in 2001. The work was the most extensive completed since the building&#x27;s construction and the architect stated that &quot;[the] objective was to create a modern, functioning office space while maintaining the historic character of the building.&quot;

The castle is open to the public each year on the European Heritage Open Day weekend.

<doc id="539925" wikidata="Q735346" url="?curid=539925" title="Duality (projective geometry)">
<text>In projective geometry, duality or plane duality is a formalization of the striking symmetry of the roles played by points and lines in the definitions and theorems of projective planes. There are two approaches to the subject of duality, one through language () and the other a more functional approach through special mappings. These are completely equivalent and either treatment has as its starting point the axiomatic version of the geometries under consideration. In the functional approach there is a map between related geometries that is called a duality. Such a map can be constructed in many ways. The concept of plane duality readily extends to &quot;space duality&quot; and beyond that to duality in any finite-dimensional projective geometry.

== Principle of duality ==
A projective plane may be defined axiomatically as an incidence structure, in terms of a set of &quot;points&quot;, a set of &quot;lines&quot;, and an incidence relation that determines which points lie on which lines. These sets can be used to define a plane dual structure.

Interchange the role of &quot;points&quot; and &quot;lines&quot; in 
to obtain the &quot;dual structure&quot;
where is the converse relation of . is also a projective plane, called the dual plane of .

If and are isomorphic, then is called self-dual. The projective planes for any field (or, more generally, for every division ring (skewfield) isomorphic to its dual) are self-dual. In particular, Desarguesian planes of finite order are always self-dual. However, there are non-Desarguesian planes which are not self-dual, such as the Hall planes and some that are, such as the Hughes planes.

In a projective plane a statement involving points, lines and incidence between them that is obtained from another such statement by interchanging the words &quot;point&quot; and &quot;line&quot; and making whatever grammatical adjustments that are necessary, is called the plane dual statement of the first. The plane dual statement of &quot;Two points are on a unique line&quot; is &quot;Two lines meet at a unique point&quot;. Forming the plane dual of a statement is known as &quot;dualizing&quot; the statement.

If a statement is true in a projective plane , then the plane dual of that statement must be true in the dual plane . This follows since dualizing each statement in the proof &quot;in &quot; gives a corresponding statement of the proof &quot;in &quot;.

The principle of plane duality says that dualizing any theorem in a self-dual projective plane produces another theorem valid in .

The above concepts can be generalized to talk about space duality, where the terms &quot;points&quot; and &quot;planes&quot; are interchanged (and lines remain lines). This leads to the &quot;principle of space duality&quot;.

These principles provide a good reason for preferring to use a &quot;symmetric&quot; term for the incidence relation. Thus instead of saying &quot;a point lies on a line&quot; one should say &quot;a point is incident with a line&quot; since dualizing the latter only involves interchanging point and line (&quot;a line is incident with a point&quot;).

The validity of the principle of plane duality follows from the axiomatic definition of a projective plane. The three axioms of this definition can be written so that they are self-dual statements implying that the dual of a projective plane is also a projective plane. The dual of a true statement in a projective plane is therefore a true statement in the dual projective plane and the implication is that for self-dual planes, the dual of a true statement in that plane is also a true statement in that plane.

===Dual theorems===
As the real projective plane, , is self-dual there are a number of pairs of well known results that are duals of each other. Some of these are:

* Desargues&#x27; theorem ⇔ Converse of Desargues&#x27; theorem
* Pascal&#x27;s theorem ⇔ Brianchon&#x27;s theorem
* Menelaus&#x27; theorem ⇔ Ceva&#x27;s theorem

===Dual configurations===

Not only statements, but also systems of points and lines can be dualized.

A set of points and lines is called an &quot;configuration&quot; if of the lines pass through each point and of the points lie on each line. The dual of an configuration, is an configuration. Thus, the dual of a quadrangle, a (43, 62) configuration of four points and six lines, is a quadrilateral, a (62, 43) configuration of six points and four lines.

The set of all points on a line, called a projective range, has as its dual a pencil of lines, the set of all lines on a point, in two dimensions, or a pencil of hyperplanes in higher dimensions. A line segment on a projective line has as its dual the shape swept out by these lines or hyperplanes, a double wedge.

==Duality as a mapping==

===Plane dualities===

A plane duality is a map from a projective plane to its &quot;dual plane&quot; (see above) which preserves incidence. That is, a plane duality will map points to lines and lines to points ( and ) in such a way that if a point is on a line (denoted by ) then . A plane duality which is an isomorphism is called a &quot;correlation&quot;. The existence of a correlation means that the projective plane is &quot;self-dual&quot;.

The projective plane in this definition need not be a Desarguesian plane. However, if it is, that is, with a division ring (skewfield), then a duality, as defined below for general projective spaces, gives a plane duality on that satisfies the above definition.
===In general projective spaces===

A duality of a projective space is a permutation of the subspaces of (also denoted by with a field (or more generally a skewfield (division ring)) that reverses inclusion, that is:
: implies for all subspaces of .
Consequently, a duality interchanges objects of dimension with objects of dimension ( = codimension ). That is, in a projective space of dimension , the points (dimension 0) correspond to hyperplanes (codimension 1), the lines joining two points (dimension 1) correspond to the intersection of two hyperplanes (codimension 2), and so on.

====Classification of dualities====
The &quot;dual&quot; of a finite-dimensional (right) vector space over a skewfield can be regarded as a (right) vector space of the same dimension over the opposite skewfield . There is thus an inclusion-reversing bijection between the projective spaces and . If and are isomorphic then there exists a duality on . Conversely, if admits a duality for , then and are isomorphic.

Let be a duality of for . If is composed with the natural isomorphism between and , the composition is an incidence preserving bijection between and . By the Fundamental theorem of projective geometry is induced by a semilinear map with associated isomorphism , which can be viewed as an antiautomorphism of . In the classical literature, would be called a reciprocity in general, and if it would be called a correlation (and would necessarily be a field). Some authors suppress the role of the natural isomorphism and call a duality. When this is done, a duality may be thought of as a collineation between a pair of specially related projective spaces and called a reciprocity. If this collineation is a projectivity then it is called a correlation.

Let denote the linear functional of associated with the vector in . Define the form by:
: formula_1
 is a nondegenerate sesquilinear form with companion antiautomorphism .

Any duality of for is induced by a nondegenerate sesquilinear form on the underlying vector space (with a companion antiautomorphism) and conversely.

==Homogeneous coordinate formulation==

Homogeneous coordinates may be used to give an algebraic description of dualities. To simplify this discussion we shall assume that is a field, but everything can be done in the same way when is a skewfield as long as attention is paid to the fact that multiplication need not be a commutative operation.

The points of can be taken to be the nonzero vectors in the ()-dimensional vector space over , where we identify two vectors which differ by a scalar factor. Another way to put it is that the points of -dimensional projective space are the 1-dimensional vector subspaces, which may be visualized as the lines through the origin in . Also the - (vector) dimensional subspaces of represent the ()- (geometric) dimensional hyperplanes of projective -space over , i.e., .

A nonzero vector in also determines an - geometric dimensional subspace (hyperplane) , by 
When a vector is used to define a hyperplane in this way it shall be denoted by , while if it is designating a point we will use . They are referred to as &quot;point coordinates&quot; or &quot;hyperplane coordinates&quot; respectively (in the important two-dimensional case, hyperplane coordinates are called &quot;line coordinates&quot;). Some authors distinguish how a vector is to be interpreted by writing hyperplane coordinates as horizontal (row) vectors while point coordinates are written as vertical (column) vectors. Thus, if is a column vector we would have while . In terms of the usual dot product, . Since is a field, the dot product is symmetrical, meaning .

===A fundamental example===
A simple reciprocity (actually a correlation) can be given by between points and hyperplanes. This extends to a reciprocity between the line generated by two points and the intersection of two such hyperplanes, and so forth.

Specifically, in the projective plane, , with a field, we have the correlation given by: points in homogeneous coordinates lines with equations . In a projective space, , a correlation is given by: points in homogeneous coordinates planes with equations . This correlation would also map a line determined by two points and to the line which is the intersection of the two planes with equations and .

The associated sesquilinear form for this correlation is:
where the companion antiautomorphism . This is therefore a bilinear form (note that must be a field). This can be written in matrix form (with respect to the standard basis) as:
where is the identity matrix, using the convention that is a row vector and is a column vector.

The correlation is given by:
: formula_2

====Geometric interpretation in the real projective plane====

This correlation in the case of can be described geometrically using the model of the real projective plane which is a &quot;unit sphere with antipodes identified&quot;, or equivalently, the model of lines and planes through the origin of the vector space . Associate to any line through the origin the unique plane through the origin which is perpendicular (orthogonal) to the line. When, in the model, these lines are considered to be the points and the planes the lines of the projective plane , this association becomes a correlation (actually a polarity) of the projective plane. The sphere model is obtained by intersecting the lines and planes through the origin with a unit sphere centered at the origin. The lines meet the sphere in antipodal points which must then be identified to obtain a point of the projective plane, and the planes meet the sphere in great circles which are thus the lines of the projective plane.

That this association &quot;preserves&quot; incidence is most easily seen from the lines and planes model. A point incident with a line in the projective plane corresponds to a line through the origin lying in a plane through the origin in the model. Applying the association, the plane becomes a line through the origin perpendicular to the plane it is associated with. This image line is perpendicular to every line of the plane which passes through the origin, in particular the original line (point of the projective plane). All lines that are perpendicular to the original line at the origin lie in the unique plane which is orthogonal to the original line, that is, the image plane under the association. Thus, the image line lies in the image plane and the association preserves incidence.

===Matrix form===

As in the above example, matrices can be used to represent dualities. Let be a duality of for and let be the associated sesquilinear form (with companion antiautomorphism ) on the underlying ()-dimensional vector space . Given a basis of , we may represent this form by:
:formula_3
where is a nonsingular matrix over and the vectors are written as column vectors. The notation means that the antiautomorphism is applied to each coordinate of the vector .

Now define the duality in terms of point coordinates by:
:formula_4
==Polarity==

A duality that is an involution (has order two) is called a polarity. It is necessary to distinguish between polarities of general projective spaces and those that arise from the slightly more general definition of plane duality. It is also possible to give more precise statements in the case of a finite geometry, so we shall emphasize the results in finite projective planes.

===Polarities of general projective spaces===
If is a duality of , with a skewfield, then a common notation is defined by for a subspace of . Hence, a polarity is a duality for which for every subspace of . It is also common to bypass mentioning the dual space and write, in terms of the associated sesquilinear form:
: formula_5

A sesquilinear form is &quot;reflexive&quot; if implies .

A duality is a polarity if and only if the (nondegenerate) sesquilinear form defining it is reflexive.

Polarities have been classified, a result of that has been reproven several times. Let be a (left) vector space over the skewfield and be a reflexive nondegenerate sesquilinear form on with companion anti-automorphism . If is the sesquilinear form associated with a polarity then either:
# (hence, is a field) and for all in , that is, is a bilinear form. In this case, the polarity is called orthogonal (or ordinary). If the characteristic of the field is two, then to be in this case there must exist a vector with , and the polarity is called a pseudo polarity.
# (hence, is a field) and for all in . The polarity is called a null polarity (or a symplectic polarity) and can only exist when the projective dimension is odd.
# (here need not be a field) and for all in . Such a polarity is called a unitary polarity (or a Hermitian polarity).

A point of is an absolute point (self-conjugate point) with respect to polarity if . Similarly, a hyperplane is an absolute hyperplane (self-conjugate hyperplane) if . Expressed in other terms, a point is an absolute point of polarity with associated sesquilinear form if and if is written in terms of matrix , .

The set of absolute points of each type of polarity can be described. We again restrict the discussion to the case that is a field.
# If is a field whose characteristic is not two, the set of absolute points of an orthogonal polarity form a nonsingular quadric (if is infinite, this might be empty). If the characteristic is two, the absolute points of a pseudo polarity form a hyperplane.
# All the points of the space are absolute points of a null polarity.
# The absolute points of a Hermitian polarity form a Hermitian variety, which may be empty if is infinite.

When composed with itself, the correlation (in any dimension) produces the identity function, so it is a polarity. The set of absolute points of this polarity would be the points whose homogeneous coordinates satisfy the equation:
Which points are in this point set depends on the field . If then the set is empty, there are no absolute points (and no absolute hyperplanes). On the other hand, if the set of absolute points form a nondegenerate quadric (a conic in two-dimensional space). If is a finite field of odd characteristic the absolute points also form a quadric, but if the characteristic is even the absolute points form a hyperplane (this is an example of a pseudo polarity).

Under any duality, the point is called the pole of the hyperplane , and this hyperplane is called the polar of the point . Using this terminology, the absolute points of a polarity are the points that are incident with their polars and the absolute hyperplanes are the hyperplanes that are incident with their poles.

===Polarities in finite projective planes===

By Wedderburn&#x27;s theorem every finite skewfield is a field and an automorphism of order two (other than the identity) can only exist in a finite field whose order is a square. These facts help to simplify the general situation for finite Desarguesian planes. We have:

If is a polarity of the finite Desarguesian projective plane where for some prime , then the number of absolute points of is if is orthogonal or if is unitary. In the orthogonal case, the absolute points lie on a conic if is odd or form a line if . The unitary case can only occur if is a square; the absolute points and absolute lines form a unital.

In the general projective plane case where duality means &quot;plane duality&quot;, the definitions of polarity, absolute elements, pole and polar remain the same.

Let denote a projective plane of order . Counting arguments can establish that for a polarity of :

The number of non-absolute points (lines) incident with a non-absolute line (point) is even.

Furthermore,

The polarity has at least absolute points and if is not a square, exactly absolute points. If has exactly absolute points then;
# if is odd, the absolute points form an oval whose tangents are the absolute lines; or
# if is even, the absolute points are collinear on a non-absolute line.

An upper bound on the number of absolute points in the case that is a square was given by Seib and a purely combinatorial argument can establish:

A polarity in a projective plane of square order has at most absolute points. Furthermore, if the number of absolute points is , then the absolute points and absolute lines form a unital (i.e., every line of the plane meets this set of absolute points in either or points).

==Poles and polars==

===Reciprocation in the Euclidean plane===

A method that can be used to construct a polarity of the real projective plane has, as its starting point, a construction of a partial duality in the Euclidean plane.

In the Euclidean plane, fix a circle with center and radius . For each point other than define an image point so that . The mapping defined by is called inversion with respect to circle . The line through which is perpendicular to the line is called the polar of the point with respect to circle .

Let be a line not passing through . Drop a perpendicular from to , meeting at the point (this is the point of that is closest to ). The image of under inversion with respect to is called the pole of . If a point is on a line (not passing through ) then the pole of lies on the polar of and vice versa. The incidence preserving process, in which points and lines are transformed into their polars and poles with respect to is called reciprocation.

In order to turn this process into a correlation, the Euclidean plane (which is not a projective plane) needs to be expanded to the extended euclidean plane by adding a line at infinity and points at infinity which lie on this line. In this expanded plane, we define the polar of the point to be the line at infinity (and is the pole of the line at infinity), and the poles of the lines through are the points of infinity where, if a line has slope its pole is the infinite point associated to the parallel class of lines with slope . The pole of the -axis is the point of infinity of the vertical lines and the pole of the -axis is the point of infinity of the horizontal lines.

The construction of a correlation based on inversion in a circle given above can be generalized by using inversion in a conic section (in the extended real plane). The correlations constructed in this manner are of order two, that is, polarities.

====Algebraic formulation====

We shall describe this polarity algebraically by following the above construction in the case that is the unit circle (i.e., ) centered at the origin.

An affine point , other than the origin, with Cartesian coordinates has as its inverse in the unit circle the point with coordinates,
:formula_6
The line passing through that is perpendicular to the line has equation .

Switching to homogeneous coordinates using the embedding , the extension to the real projective plane is obtained by permitting the last coordinate to be 0. Recalling that point coordinates are written as column vectors and line coordinates as row vectors, we may express this polarity by:

:formula_7
such that
:formula_8

Or, using the alternate notation, . The matrix of the associated sesquilinear form (with respect to the standard basis) is:

:formula_9

The absolute points of this polarity are given by the solutions of:

:formula_10

where T. Note that restricted to the Euclidean plane (that is, set ) this is just the unit circle, the circle of inversion.

===Synthetic approach===

The theory of poles and polars of a conic in a projective plane can be developed without the use of coordinates and other metric concepts.

Let be a conic in where is a field not of characteristic two, and let be a point of this plane not on . Two distinct secant lines to the conic, say and determine four points on the conic () that form a quadrangle. The point is a vertex of the diagonal triangle of this quadrangle. The &quot;polar&quot; of with respect to is the side of the diagonal triangle opposite .

The theory of projective harmonic conjugates of points on a line can also be used to define this relationship. Using the same notation as above;

If a variable line through the point is a secant of the conic , the harmonic conjugates of with respect to the two points of on the secant all lie on the &quot;polar&quot; of .

===Properties===

There are several properties that polarities in a projective plane have.

Given a polarity , a point lies on line , the polar of point if and only if lies on , the polar of .

Points and that are in this relation are called conjugate points with respect to . Absolute points are called self-conjugate in keeping with this definition since they are incident with their own polars. Conjugate lines are defined dually.

The line joining two self-conjugate points cannot be a self-conjugate line.

A line cannot contain more than two self-conjugate points.

A polarity induces an involution of conjugate points on any line that is not self-conjugate.

A triangle in which each vertex is the pole of the opposite side is called a self-polar triangle.

A correlation that maps the three vertices of a triangle to their opposite sides respectively is a polarity and this triangle is self-polar with respect to this polarity.

==History==
The principle of duality is due to Joseph Diaz Gergonne (1771−1859) a champion of the then emerging field of Analytic geometry and founder and editor of the first journal devoted entirely to mathematics, &quot;Annales de mathématiques pures et appliquées&quot;. Gergonne and Charles Julien Brianchon (1785−1864) developed the concept of plane duality. Gergonne coined the terms &quot;duality&quot; and &quot;polar&quot; (but &quot;pole&quot; is due to F.-J. Servois) and adopted the style of writing dual statements side by side in his journal.

Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788−1867) author of the first text on projective geometry, &quot;Traité des propriétés projectives des figures&quot;, was a synthetic geometer who systematically developed the theory of poles and polars with respect to a conic. Poncelet maintained that the principle of duality was a consequence of the theory of poles and polars.

Julius Plücker (1801−1868) is credited with extending the concept of duality to three and higher dimensional projective spaces.

Poncelet and Gergonne started out as earnest but friendly rivals presenting their different points of view and techniques in papers appearing in &quot;Annales de Gergonne&quot;. Antagonism grew over the issue of priority in claiming the principle of duality as their own. A young Plücker was caught up in this feud when a paper he had submitted to Gergonne was so heavily edited by the time it was published that Poncelet was misled into believing that Plücker had plagiarized him. The vitriolic attack by Poncelet was countered by Plücker with the support of Gergonne and ultimately the onus was placed on Gergonne. Of this feud, Pierre Samuel has quipped that since both men were in the French army and Poncelet was a general while Gergonne a mere captain, Poncelet&#x27;s view prevailed, at least among their French contemporaries.

<text>Totenkopf (, i.e. &quot;skull&quot;, literally &quot;dead person&#x27;s head&quot;) is the German word for skull. The word is often used to denote a figurative, graphic or sculptural symbol, common in Western culture, consisting of the representation of a human skull – usually frontal, more rarely in profile with or without the mandible. In some cases, other human skeletal parts may be added, often including two crossed long bones (femurs) depicted below or behind the skull (when it may be referred to in English as a &quot;skull and crossbones&quot;). The human skull is an internationally used symbol for death, the defiance of death, danger, or the dead, as well as piracy or toxicity.

In English, the term &quot;Totenkopf&quot; is commonly associated with 19th- and 20th-century German military use, particularly in Nazi Germany.

== Naval use ==
In early modern sea warfare to early modern sea piracy, buccaneers and pirates used the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; as a pirate flag: a skull or other skeletal parts as a death threat and as a demand to hand over a ship. The symbol continues to be used by modern navies.
==German military==
===Prussia===

Use of the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; as a military emblem began under Frederick the Great, who formed a regiment of Hussar cavalry in the Prussian army commanded by Colonel von Ruesch, the Husaren-Regiment Nr. 5 (von Ruesch). It adopted a black uniform with a &quot;Totenkopf&quot; emblazoned on the front of its mirlitons and wore it on the field in the War of Austrian Succession and in the Seven Years&#x27; War. The &quot;Totenkopf&quot; remained a part of the uniform when the regiment was reformed into Leib-Husaren Regiments Nr.1 and Nr.2 in 1808.

=== Brunswick ===

In 1809, during the War of the Fifth Coalition, Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel raised a force of volunteers to fight Napoleon Bonaparte, who had conquered the Duke&#x27;s lands. The Brunswick corps was provided with black uniforms, giving rise to their nickname, the Black Brunswickers. Both hussar cavalry and infantry in the force wore a &quot;Totenkopf&quot; badge, either in mourning for the duke&#x27;s father, Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who had been killed at the Battle of Jena–Auerstedt in 1806, or according to some sources, as a sign of revenge against the French. After fighting their way through Germany, the Black Brunswickers entered British service and fought with them in the Peninsular War and at the Battle of Waterloo. The Brunswick corps was eventually incorporated into the Prussian Army in 1866.

=== German Empire ===

The skull continued to be used by the Prussian and Brunswick armed forces until 1918, and some of the stormtroopers that led the last German offensives on the Western Front in 1918 used skull badges. &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; fighter pilots Georg von Hantelmann and Kurt Adolf Monnington are just two of a number of Central Powers military pilots who used the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; as their personal aircraft insignia.

=== Weimar Republic ===
The &quot;Totenkopf&quot; was used in Germany throughout the interwar period, most prominently by the &quot;Freikorps&quot;. In 1933, it was in use by the regimental staff and the 1st, 5th, and 11th squadrons of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;″s 5th Cavalry Regiment as a continuation of a tradition from the &quot;Kaiserreich&quot;.

===Nazi Germany===
In the early days of the Nazi Party, Julius Schreck, the leader of the &quot;Stabswache&quot; (Adolf Hitler&#x27;s bodyguard unit), resurrected the use of the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; as the unit&#x27;s insignia. This unit grew into the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS), which continued to use the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; as insignia throughout its history. According to a writing by Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; had the following meaning:

The &quot;Skull&quot; is the reminder that you shall always be willing to put your self at stake for the life of the whole community.

&quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (&#x27;Death&#x27;s Head Units&#x27;) was the Schutzstaffel (SS) organization responsible for administering the Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps for Nazi Germany, among similar duties. While the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; was the universal cap badge of the SS, the SS-TV also wore this insignia on the right collar tab to distinguish itself from other SS formations.

The &quot;Totenkopf&quot; was also used as the unit insignia of the &quot;Panzer&quot; forces of the German &quot;Heer&quot; (Army), and also by the &quot;Panzer&quot; units of the Luftwaffe, including those of the elite Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring.

Both the 3rd SS Panzer Division of the Waffen-SS, and the World War II era Luftwaffe&#x27;s 54th Bomber Wing &quot;Kampfgeschwader 54&quot; were given the unit name &quot;Totenkopf&quot;, and used a strikingly similar-looking graphic skull-crossbones insignia as the SS units of the same name. The 3rd SS Panzer Division also had skull patches on their uniform collars instead of the SS sieg rune.

* A skull and crossbones has often been a symbol of pirates, especially in the form of the Jolly Roger, but usually having the crossbones &quot;below&quot; the skull&#x27;s lower mandibile (if present) rather than behind it, as used by pirate Samuel Bellamy in one example.
* The uniform of the Spanish Army&#x27;s Lusitania Dragoon Regiment during part of the 18th century included three skull and crossbones in the cuffs, and in 1902 the skull and crossbones insignia was authorized again to replace the regiment number on the sides of the collar.

==Etymology==
&quot;Toten-Kopf&quot; translates literally to &quot;Dead&#x27;s Head&quot;, meaning exactly &quot;dead person&#x27;s head&quot;. Semantically, it refers to a skull, literally a &quot;Schädel&quot;. As a term, &quot;Totenkopf&quot; connotes the human skull as a symbol, typically one with crossed thigh bones as part of a grouping.

The common translation of &quot;Totenkopf&quot; as &quot;death&#x27;s head&quot; is incorrect; it would be &quot;Todeskopf&quot;, but no such word is in use -- the English term death squad is called &quot;Todesschwadron&quot;, not &quot;Totenschwadron&quot;. It would be a logical fallacy to conclude that usage varies only because of the German naming of the death&#x27;s-head hawkmoth, which is called &quot;skull hawkmoth&quot; (&quot;Totenkopfschwärmer&quot;) in German, in the same way that it would be a fallacy to conclude that the German word for &quot;night candle&quot; (i.e. &quot;Nachtkerze&quot;) would mean &quot;willowherb&quot;, just because the willowherb hawkmoth (&quot;Proserpinus proserpina&quot;) is called &quot;night candle hawkmoth&quot; (&quot;&quot;, &quot;Proserpinus proserpina&quot;
) in German.

Contemporary German language meaning of the word &quot;Totenkopf&quot; has not changed for at least two centuries. For example, the German poet Clemens Brentano (1778–1842) wrote in the story &quot;Baron Hüpfenstich&quot;: &quot;Lauter Totenbeine und Totenköpfe, die standen oben herum ...&quot; (i.e. &quot;A lot of bones and skulls, they were placed above ...&quot;).

<text>Parliament Buildings, often referred to as Stormont, because of its location in the Stormont Estate area of Belfast, is the seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the devolved legislature for Northern Ireland. The purpose-built building, designed by Arnold Thornely, and constructed by Stewart &amp; Partners, was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), in 1932.

The Executive or government is located at Stormont Castle. In March 1987, the main Parliament Building became a Grade A Listed building.

==History==

===Original plans===

The need for a separate parliament building for Northern Ireland emerged with the creation of the Northern Ireland Home Rule region within Ulster in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Pending the construction of the new building, the new Parliament of Northern Ireland met in two locations; one in Belfast City Hall, where the state opening of the first Parliament by King George V took place on 22 June 1921, and the other in the nearby Presbyterian Church in Ireland&#x27;s Assembly&#x27;s College.

In 1922, a design by Sir Arnold Thornely of Liverpool was chosen and preparatory work on the chosen site, east of Belfast, began. These plans were for a large domed building with two subsidiary side buildings, housing all three branches of government: legislative, executive and judicial, giving rise to the plural in the official title still used today.

These plans were found to be too costly, and it was decided to build only the Parliament Building, without the dome. The foundation stone was laid on 19 May 1928. It was 
designed in the neoclassical style, built by Stewart &amp; Partners in ashlar stone and opened by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), on 16 November 1932.

===Finished building===
After the shelving of plans to build a &quot;Ministerial Building&quot;, the headquarters of government was in effect Stormont Castle, a baronial castellated house in the grounds and which was originally meant to have been demolished to make way for the &quot;Ministerial Building&quot;. Stormont Castle served as the official residence of the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and was the meeting place for the Northern Ireland Cabinet. Another building, Stormont House, served as the official residence of the Speaker of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland. The reduced plans saw the High Court eventually located in the newly built Royal Courts of Justice, Belfast in the city centre.

Two separate chambers were provided in the finished parliamentary complex, the blue-benched rectangular House of Commons of Northern Ireland (green benches as at Westminster being considered inappropriate) and the red-benched smaller rectangular Senate of Northern Ireland. In the main hall, originally called the &quot;Central Hall&quot; but now known as the &quot;Great Hall&quot;, a large gold-plated chandelier was hung. It was a gift from King George V and had originally hung in Windsor Castle, where it had been a gift from German Emperor Wilhelm II. The Kaiser&#x27;s chandelier had been removed from Windsor Castle and placed in storage during World War I. It was never hung in Windsor Castle again.

The painting &quot;The Entry of King William into Ireland&quot;, a gift from the Dutch Government to its Northern Ireland counterpart, was hung in the House of Commons when it opened. However, it was removed after concerns that the painting also showed the Pope, who had blessed William&#x27;s enterprise.

The building itself changed little over the years, even as the parliaments meeting inside it did. To camouflage it during World War II, the building&#x27;s Portland stone was painted with supposedly removable &quot;paint&quot; made of bitumen and cow manure. However, after the war, removing the paint proved an enormous difficulty, with the paint having scarred the stonework. It took seven years to remove the &quot;paint&quot;, and the exterior façade has never regained its original white colour. While most traces of it were removed from the façades (though having done damage that can be seen up close), some of the remains of the paint survive in the inner courtyards and unseen parts of the building.

===Statues===
Additional changes to the building and its environs include the erection of a statue to Edward, Lord Carson, in dramatic pose (on the drive leading up to the building) in 1932, a rare example of a statue to a person being erected before death, and the erection of a statue to Lord Craigavon in the Great Hall, halfway up the Imperial Staircase. Craigavon and his wife Viscountess Craigavon are buried in the estate grounds.

=== Architectural fittings ===
Throughout the building, Robert Adams &quot;Crown Victor&quot; and &quot;Sceptre Victor&quot; floor springs were used to control the doors.

===Uses for the building===
The building was used for the Parliament of Northern Ireland until it was prorogued in 1972. The Senate chamber was used by the Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) as an operations room during World War II. The building was used for the short-lived Sunningdale power-sharing executive in 1974. Between 1973 and 1998, it served as the headquarters of the Northern Ireland Civil Service (N.I.C.S.). Between 1982 and 1986, it served as the seat of the rolling-devolution assembly.

In the 1990s, Sinn Féin suggested that a new parliament building for Northern Ireland should be erected, saying that the building at Stormont was too controversial and too associated with unionist rule to be used by a power-sharing assembly. However, no one else supported the demand and the new Northern Ireland Assembly and executive was installed there as its permanent home.

On 3 December 2005, the Great Hall was used for the funeral service of former Northern Ireland and Manchester United footballer George Best. The building was selected for the funeral as it is in the only grounds in Belfast suitable to accommodate the large number of members of the public who wished to attend the funeral. Approximately 25,000 people gathered in the grounds, with thousands more lining the cortege route.

On 29 September 2012, the grounds were used for an Orange Order parade in memory of the signing of the Ulster Covenant. 60,000 people thronged the grounds after a parade through the streets of Belfast.

===Security breach===

On 24 November 2006, Michael Stone (a loyalist paramilitary member) was arrested for breaking into Stormont with an imitation handgun and a knife, and scrawling graffiti on Parliament Buildings itself. Initial news reports indicated that he may have been carrying a &quot;suspect device&quot;. Later, between six and eight pipe bombs were defused by the Army.

==The chambers==
===Assembly Chamber===

The entire House of Commons chamber was destroyed by a fire on 2 January 1995, blamed on an electrical fault in the wiring below the Speaker&#x27;s chair. Critics alleged arson and noted how the destruction of the chamber allowed the creation of the modern, less-confrontational chamber now used by the power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly, which has no echo of the earlier seating arrangement. The British Government, citing the Doyle Report and the findings of the Northern Ireland forensic science laboratory, stated that it was &quot;improbable&quot; that the fire was deliberate. The seating is arranged in a horseshoe arrangement.

===Senate===

Unlike the new Assembly chamber which replaced the old House of Commons chamber, the Senate chamber, with its red leather adversarial seats in two parallel blocks of benches, remains as it was originally designed. Irish damask linen hangs on the walls; plans to line the walls with large oil paintings fell through. The chamber has not been used as a parliamentary chamber in plenary session since the suspension of devolved government in 1972. The Senate chamber is now used as a committee room.

There have been few changes made to the chamber since the building opened in 1932. One change is the installation of television cameras and microphones. Another is the addition of two paintings. One painting, which is untitled, depicts the state opening of the Northern Ireland Parliament in 1921. Facing this painting on the opposing wall is &quot;The House Shall Divide&quot;, a group portrait of the members elected to the inaugural Assembly in the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election.

A further alteration that has been made to the chamber since 1932 is the addition of an inscription in the marble of the balustrade of the Senate Chambers Press Gallery. The message reads: &quot;This inscription records the gratitude of His Majesty&#x27;s Government in the United Kingdom for the use of this chamber as an operations room by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.&quot;

==Stormont Estate==

The Stormont Estate is the site of Northern Ireland&#x27;s main government buildings, including the Parliament Buildings, Stormont Castle and Stormont House.

===Stormont regulations===
The regulations governing the use of the Stormont Estate are displayed at its entrance. These were initially enacted on 31 October 1933, in an order by the Ministry of Finance. These were eventually amended and the regulations currently in force are:
* The Stormont Estate Regulations, 1933
* The Stormont Estate Amendment Regulations (Northern Ireland), 1951
* The Stormont Estate Amendment Regulations (Northern Ireland), 1958

<text>Dextrins are a group of low-molecular-weight carbohydrates produced by the hydrolysis of starch and glycogen. Dextrins are mixtures of polymers of D-glucose units linked by α-(1→4) or α-(1→6) glycosidic bonds.

Dextrins can be produced from starch using enzymes like amylases, as during digestion in the human body and during malting and mashing in beer brewing or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions (pyrolysis or roasting). This procedure was first discovered in 1811 by Edme-Jean Baptiste Bouillon-Lagrange. The latter process is used industrially, and also occurs on the surface of bread during the baking process, contributing to flavor, color and crispness. Dextrins produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins. Starch hydrolyses during roasting under acidic conditions, and short-chained starch parts partially rebranch with α-(1,6) bonds to the degraded starch molecule. See also Maillard reaction.

Dextrins are white, yellow, or brown powders that are partially or fully water-soluble, yielding optically active solutions of low viscosity. Most of them can be detected with iodine solution, giving a red coloration; one distinguishes erythrodextrin (dextrin that colours red) and achrodextrin (giving no colour).

White and yellow dextrins from starch roasted with little or no acid are called British gum.

==Uses==
Yellow dextrins are used as water-soluble glues in remoistenable envelope adhesives and paper tubes, in the mining industry as additives in froth flotation, in the foundry industry as green strength additives in sand casting, as printing thickener for batik resist dyeing, and as binders in gouache paint and also in the leather industry.

White dextrins are used as: 
* A crispness enhancer for food processing, in food batters, coatings, and glazes, (INS number 1400) 
* a textile finishing and coating agent to increase weight and stiffness of textile fabrics
* a thickening and binding agent in pharmaceuticals and paper coatings
* a pyrotechnic binder and fuel; this is added to firework effect or color compositions; allowing them to solidify as pellets (stars or comets); and to sparkler compositions which the handle is dipped in
* a stabilizing agent for certain explosive metal azides, particularly Lead(II) azide

Owing to their rebranching, dextrins are less digestible than other carbohydrates. Indigestible dextrins have been developed as soluble stand-alone fiber supplements and for adding to processed food products.

== Other types==
* Maltodextrin

Maltodextrin is a short-chain starch sugar used as a food additive. It is also produced by enzymatic hydrolysis from gelled starch, and is usually found as a creamy-white hygroscopic spray-dried powder. Maltodextrin is easily digestible, being absorbed as rapidly as glucose, and might either be moderately sweet or have hardly any flavor at all.

* Cyclodextrin

The cyclical dextrins are known as cyclodextrins. They are formed by enzymatic degradation of starch by certain bacteria, for example, &quot;Paenibacillus macerans&quot; (&quot;Bacillus macerans&quot;). Cyclodextrins have toroidal structures formed by 6–8 glucose residues.

* Amylodextrin is a linear dextrin or short chained amylose (DP 20-30) that can be produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of the alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds or debranching amylopectin. Amylodextrin colors blue with iodine.
*(Beta) Limit dextrin is the remaining polymer produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of amylopectin with beta amylase, which cannot hydrolyse the alpha-1,6 bonds at branch points.
*(Alpha) Limit dextrin is a short chained branched amylopectin remnant, produced by hydrolysis of amylopectin with alpha amylase.
* Highly branched cyclic dextrin is a dextrin produced from enzymatic breaking of the amylopectin in clusters and using branching enzyme to form large cyclic chains.

<text>Maj Sjöwall (; 25 September 1935 – 29 April 2020) was a Swedish author and translator. She is best known for her books about police detective Martin Beck. She wrote the books in collaborative work with her partner Per Wahlöö.

==Biography==
Maj Sjöwall was the daughter of Margit Trobäck and CEO Will Sjöwall.

After completing school Sjöwall was employed at Åhlén &amp; Åkerlunds publishers between 1954 and 1959, Wahlström &amp; Widstrands publishers between 1959 and 1961 and then Esselte publishers between 1961 and 1963.

Sjöwall was best known for the collaborative work with her partner Per Wahlöö on a series of ten novels about the exploits of Martin Beck, a police detective in Stockholm. They also wrote several novels separately. In 1971, the fourth of the Beck books, &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot; (a translation of &quot;Den skrattande polisen&quot;, originally published in 1968) won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Novel; the book was also adapted into the film &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot; starring Walter Matthau. In 2013, Sjöwall received the fifth Lenin Award.

After the death of Wahlöö, she continued working as a translator, writing columns for magazines and as an author. With Danish author Bjarne Nielsen she in 1989 published the book &quot;Dansk Intermezzo&quot;. In 1990, she and author Tomas Ross published the thriller &quot;Kvinnan som liknade Greta Garbo&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sjöwall married her first husband, magazine editor Gunnar Isaksson, in 1955, and they divorced in 1958. She married again in 1959 to photographer Hans J. Flodquist; they divorced in 1962.

Sjöwall had a 13-year relationship with Wahlöö, which lasted until his death in 1975.

Sjöwall died on 29 April 2020, at the age of 84 after a prolonged illness.

<text>Per Fredrik Wahlöö (5 August 1926 – 22 June 1975) – in English translations often identified as Peter Wahloo – was a Swedish author. He is perhaps best known for the collaborative work with his partner Maj Sjöwall on a series of ten novels about the exploits of Martin Beck, a police detective in Stockholm, published between 1965 and 1975. In 1971, &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot; (a translation of &quot;Den skrattande polisen&quot;, originally published in 1968) won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Novel. Wahlöö and Sjöwall also wrote novels separately.

Wahlöö was born in Tölö parish, Kungsbacka Municipality, Halland. Following school, he worked as a crime reporter from 1946 onwards. After long trips around the world he returned to Sweden and started working as a journalist again.

He had a thirteen-year relationship with Sjöwall but they never married, as he already was married. Both were Marxists.

== Biography ==
Wahlöö&#x27;s career in journalism started in 1947 in Sydsvenskan in Malmö and continued in 1949 at the new &quot;Evening Post&quot;, where he was a permanent employee, to 1953. He moved onto freelance work in the 1950s, writing theater reviews and film articles for various newspapers including for the newspapers in Norrköping before moving to Stockholm. By May 1964 Per Wahlöö&#x27;s journalistic path was said to be complete. Subsequently, he was involved in the New Left journal &quot;Tidsignal (Time Signal)&quot; (1965–1970) where he was part of the editorial board, among others including the writer .

A leftist tendency and a dramatically effective narrative distinguished Wahlöö&#x27;s early novels about power and the right, for example &quot;A Necessary Action&quot; from 1962, which depicts Franco&#x27;s Spain, and his &quot;Dictatorship&quot; series. From the mid-1960s, he wrote together with life companion Maj Sjöwall a series of detective novels with criminal investigator Martin Beck as protagonist. Several of them have been filmed. 

A Swedish TV film series began running in 1997, with Peter Haber as Martin Beck. The series was bought by the BBC in 2015, and shown in the United Kingdom with English subtitles.

Per Wahlöö died in Malmö in 1975, after an unsuccessful operation on the pancreas, necessitated by cancer. He is interned in the memorial garden at Malmo Sankt Pauli&#x27;s central cemetery.

<text>Norway has 48 national parks, of which 41 are on the mainland and 7 on Svalbard. National parks in Norway are stricter than many other countries, and nearly all motorized vehicles are prohibited. The Right to roam applies, thus hiking, skiing and camping throughout the park are permitted, given that consideration to nature is taken. Roads, accommodation and national park centers are located outside the national parks. The parks are under the management of the Norwegian Environment Agency and the local county governor.

Ytre Hvaler is a marine park and all parks in Svalbard also contain marine areas. Sør-Spitsbergen is the largest park, covering an area of , although only is land. The newest national park assigned in Norway is Østmarka established in 2023. The largest park on the mainland is Hardangervidda, which covers an area of . Gutulia is the smallest, covering .

== Geography and history ==
At least 60% of Norway&#x27;s area is mountainous, lakes or bogs (non-arable land, some of it is used as pastures); 37% is forest of various kinds; and only 3% arable land. It is estimated that between 1900 and 2003 areas more than 5 km from intense construction activity have decreased from 48% to 12% in Norway.

Until about one hundred years ago there was relatively little threat to ecosystems in Norway. The first initiatives to protect land were voiced in 1904, by Yngvar Nielsen, leader of the Norwegian Mountain Touring Association (DNT). The association continued to lobby cases in 1923 and 1938. The natural protection act of 1954 prepared a legal basis for establishing protection areas, and the two first national parks were established in 1962 and 1963. The act of 1954 also established &quot;Statens naturvernråd&quot; (&quot;Governmental Natural protection council&quot;) as an advisory body for the government. The council presented a draft for further natural protecting in 1964, suggesting 16 national parks. These suggestions were approved by Stortinget. It took 25 years, until 1989, before 15 of their suggestions were fulfilled. The 16th suggestion became a &quot;naturreservat&quot;. The council presented another suggestion in 1986, and this was approved by Stortinget in April 1993. Following this approval, a &quot;second generation&quot; of national parks, as well as expanding borders for the elder, were established from 2001.

The post-industrial era that started in the last 1960s saw areas being protected as national parks or other protected status as a means to regulate the construction of vacation homes, roads, fishing, hunting, and gathering plants. This trend has accelerated in the last 10 years. In addition to preserving rare plant and animal life, areas are protected to maintain reference points for environmental research, recreational resources for Norwegians, and as an inheritance for future generations. The Directorate for Nature Management maintains indicators for the health of nature in Norway, including such measures as biological diversity, erosion, signs of pollution.

For the most part, national parks are open to hiking, cross-country skiing and camping. Most have a limited number of overnight cabins.

In addition to national parks, the Norwegian government has designated larger areas for protection. Included in these areas are 153 landscapes covering 14071 km2; 1,701 nature reserves covering 3,418 km2; 24 national parks covering 21,650 km2; 102 natural memorials, and 98 smaller protected areas. This accounts for 12.1% of Norway&#x27;s mainland area.

The Norwegian government&#x27;s goal is to increase this area over time to at least 15%. They have signalled an interest in preserving marine ecosystems, including the fjords of the western parts of Norway, and the archipelago southwest from Oslo.

==Current==
==Former==
== Planned==
There are also several national park proposals by many different parties: Solværøyene, Storheia; Melkevatn–Hjertvatn–Børsvatn, Okstindan; Frafjordheiene; Oksøy-Ryvingen; Setesdal Vesthei, Trollheimen, Lyngsalpan; Mølen.

Storheia has since been covered in a wind farm and would no longer qualify for protection as a national park, and parts of Melkevatn–Hjertvatn–Børsvatn were protected as a nature reserve rather than a national park.

After being tasked by the Ministry of Climate and Environment in 2018 to find areas that should be protected, in 2019 the Environment Agency made a number of suggestions for new national parks as well as expansions of existing ones, after looking through suggestions from the county governors. In 2021, after meetings with the affected municipalities, they made a final list of suggestions for national parks that should get further consideration. The proposed new protections are: Sunnmørsalpane, Hornelen, Masfjordfjella and Øystesefjella. Additionally, they proposed some protected areas to be changed to national park: Lyngsalpan, Sylan, Trollheimen and Innerdalen, Ålfotbreen, Oksøy-Ryvingen, and Flekkefjord and Listastrendene. Many other proposals were cancelled due to local opposition: Kvænangsvidda-Nabar, Treriksrøysa, Preikestolen, Kvitladalen-Bjordalen, Viglesdalen; as well as some proposed changes of type of protection: Naustdal-Gjengedal and Setesdal Vesthei Ryfylkeheiane.

<text>Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (&quot;née&quot; Gandhi; born 12 January 1972) is an Indian politician who is serving as the member of the Lok Sabha for Wayanad, Kerala, since November 2024. A member of the Indian National Congress, she is also serving as a general secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC).

Gandhi Vadra is a member of the politically prominent Nehru-Gandhi family. She is also a trustee of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.

==Early life and education==
Gandhi was born in Delhi on 12 January 1972 to Rajiv Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, as the younger of their two children. Her older brother Rahul Gandhi is a member of Parliament from Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh and 12th Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha. She is the granddaughter of Indira Gandhi, the former Prime Minister of India, and Feroze Gandhi, a freedom fighter and politician, and the great-granddaughter of India&#x27;s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.

Gandhi did her schooling at Welham Girls&#x27; School in Dehradun till 1984. After this, both Rahul and she were moved to day schools in Delhi due to security reasons. After the assassination of Indira Gandhi, because of constant terror threats, she and her brother Rahul were home-schooled. Later she joined the Convent of Jesus and Mary, Delhi. She then completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology from Jesus and Mary College, New Delhi, and a master&#x27;s degree in Buddhist studies in 2010.

In 1997, Gandhi married Robert Vadra, a Delhi-based businessman, and started using the name Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The couple have two children.

After being asked to vacate the government accommodation at Lodhi estate, Gandhi moved to Gurugram. 

==Political career==
Gandhi Vadra regularly visited the constituencies of Rae Bareilly and Amethi, where she interacted directly with the local residents. In the 2004 Indian general election, she served as her mother&#x27;s campaign manager and assisted in overseeing her brother Rahul Gandhi&#x27;s campaign. During the 2007 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, while Rahul Gandhi managed the statewide campaign, she concentrated on the ten seats in the Amethi and Rae Bareilly region, spending two weeks addressing infighting among party workers over seat allocations.

===Formative years===
Despite Gandhi Vadra&#x27;s reluctance to engage directly in politics before her official entry in 2019, she actively participated in election campaigns for her mother and brother in both general and assembly elections. She frequently visited the constituencies of Rae Bareilly and Amethi, where she interacted directly with the residents. This involvement made her a known figure with significant support in these areas, leading to the election slogan in Amethi, &quot;Amethi ka Danka, Bitiya Priyanka&quot; (the clarion call from Amethi is for Priyanka to stand for elections).

===Political debut===

On 23 January 2019, she formally entered politics after being appointed as the AICC General Secretary in charge of the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh and then as the General Secretary in charge of the entire state of Uttar Pradesh on 11 September 2020.

In October 2021, Gandhi Vadra was detained twice by the UP Police. The first detention followed her visit to Lakhimpur Kheri in western UP where eight people were killed following clashes between protesting farmers and the convey of Union Minister Ajay Misra&#x27;s son. She and several other party leaders were detained at a PAC guest house in Sitapur, which was being used as a temporary jail to keep them for over 50 hrs. The second detention tool place in the district of Agra where the UP Police detained her citing a ban on gatherings, while on her way to Agra to meet the family members of a man who allegedly died in police custody.

====2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections====
Gandhi Vadra launched the Congress party&#x27;s Uttar Pradesh poll campaign from Barabanki on 23 October 2021. 
In January 2022, she launched the Congress&#x27;s manifesto for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly election along with her brother Rahul. The manifesto was focused on youth and women empowerment along with development for the state and also promised 40% of tickets to women in upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.

Pivoting the campaign on women&#x27;s empowerment and participation in politics, she kickstarted the &quot;Ladki hoon, Lad Sakti hoon&quot; campaign in the state. On the day of International Women&#x27;s Day, she launched a rally in the state&#x27;s capital Lucknow which, laced with several promises and hopes, saw the participation of women from all over the state.

Despite all her attempts to revive the party in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress Party faced a rout in the assembly elections; winning just 2 out of the 403 assembly seats. Gandhi Vadra resigned as AICC General Secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh in December 2023.

Following the Congress&#x27; defeat in the state elections, on 5 August 2022, she took part in Congress&#x27;s ‘Mehangai Par Halla Bol’ protest against price-rise and inflation and was detained by the Delhi Police.

===Member of Parliament===
After extensively campaigning for the Congress during the 2024 Indian general election and taking a more organisational role within the party, Gandhi Vadra announced that she would join electoral politics and contest as the party&#x27;s candidate for the Wayanad bypoll, to succeed her brother, Rahul. She won the election by a margin of 4,10,931 votes. She will serve in Parliament alongside her mother Sonia and brother Rahul. She and her brother are the only sibling duo serving together in the 18th Lok Sabha.

<doc id="539947" wikidata="Q71769" url="?curid=539947" title="Nye Committee">
<text>The Nye Committee, officially known as the Special Committee on Investigation of the Munitions Industry, was a United States Senate committee (April 12, 1934 – February 24, 1936), chaired by U.S. Senator Gerald Nye (R-ND). The committee investigated the financial and banking interests that underlay the United States&#x27; involvement in World War I and the operations and profits of the industrial and commercial firms supplying munitions to the Allies and to the United States. It was a significant factor in public and political support for American neutrality in the early stages of World War II.

== Background ==
During the 1920s and 1930s, dozens of books and articles appeared about the high cost of war, and some argued that financiers and arms manufacturers had maneuvered the United States into entering World War I. One of the best-known was Smedley D. Butler, a retired Marine Corps general who had become a spokesman for left-wing anti-war elements. Historian Charles Callan Tansill&#x27;s &quot;America Goes To War&quot; (1938) exploited the Nye Committee&#x27;s voluminous report of testimony and evidence to develop and confirm the heavy influence exercised by Wall Street finance (notably J.P. Morgan) and the armaments industry (notably Du Pont) in the process that led to American intervention.

The push for the appointment of Senator Gerald Nye (R-ND) to the chairmanship of this committee came from Senator George Norris (R-NE). According to peace activist Dorothy Detzer, Norris said, &quot;Nye&#x27;s young, he has inexhaustible energy, and he has courage. Those are all important boons. He may be rash in his judgments at times, but it&#x27;s the rashness of enthusiasm.&quot; Norris proposed Nye as &quot;...the only one out of the 96 whom he deemed to have the competence, independence and stature for the task.&quot;

== Organization ==
The committee was established on April 12, 1934. There were seven members: Nye, the committee chair; and Senators Homer T. Bone (D-WA), James P. Pope (D-ID), Bennett Champ Clark (D-MO), Walter F. George (D-GA), W. Warren Barbour (R-NJ), and Arthur H. Vandenberg (R-MI).

Stephen Rauschenbusch, son of Christian Social Gospel activist Walter Rauschenbusch, was appointed lead counsel for the Committee; his assisting counsel included Robert Wolforth, Josephine Burns and Alger Hiss. John T. Flynn &quot;played a major role in the course of the investigation&quot; as a member of the committee&#x27;s Advisory Council of experts. Burns and Rauschenbusch, who met on the committee, married soon after and co-authored a book that recounts salient testimony gathered by the investigation, &quot;War Madness&quot; (Washington, D.C., National Home Library Association, 1937). Alger Hiss served as a legal assistant (counsel) to the committee from July 1934 to August 1935. Most famously, Hiss &quot;badgered&quot; DuPont officials and questioned and cross-examined Bernard Baruch on March 29, 1935. About their testimony, Dorothy Detzer (Appointment On The Hill, p. 169) reports: &quot;The four solemn Du Pont brothers,&quot; averred that &quot;the corporation&#x27;s profits of 400% during the First World War seemed only the good fruit of sound business.&quot;

== Process ==
The Nye Committee conducted 93 hearings and questioned more than 200 witnesses. The first hearings were in September 1934 and the final hearings in February 1936. The hearings covered four topics: 
* The munitions industry
* Bidding on Government contracts in the shipbuilding industry
* War profits
* The background leading up to U.S. entry into World War I.

The committee documented the huge profits that arms factories had made during the war. It found that bankers had pressured Wilson to intervene in the war in order to protect their loans abroad. Also, the arms industry was at fault for price-fixing and held excessive influence on American foreign policy leading up to and during World War I.

According to the United States Senate website:
In her memoir, Appointment On The Hill (p. 169), Dorothy Detzer, an intimate eye-witness to the Committee&#x27;s processes, summarizes: &quot;The long exhaustive investigation ... produced a sordid report of intrigues and bribery; of collusion and excessive profits; of war scares artificially fostered and [disarmament] conferences deliberately wrecked.&quot; The &quot;recommendations, accompanying the committee&#x27;s reports to the Senate, were presented in a series of interlocking legislative measures ... The Neutrality Bill, providing for an embargo on arms and loans to nations at war, was the only legislation even partially enacted into law. But even it was crippled by its &#x27;half-measure&#x27; provisions. (p. 171).

==Results==
Nye created headlines by drawing connections between the wartime profits of the banking and munitions industries to America&#x27;s involvement in the World War. Many Americans felt betrayed and questioned that the war had been an epic battle between the forces of good (democracy) and evil (autocracy), as it had been depicted in pro-war propaganda. This investigation of these &quot;merchants of death&quot; helped to bolster sentiments favoring neutrality, non-interventionism, disarmament, and taking the profits out of weapons procurements.

The committee reported that between 1915 and January 1917, the United States lent Germany $27 million. In the same period, it lent to Britain and its allies $2.3 billion. These loans were made during wartime: July 28, 1914 – November 11, 1918.

Because of these facts Senator Nye, many war critics, and members of the American public concluded that the US entered the war for reasons of profit, not policy — because it was in the interest of American finance banks and investors for the Allies not to lose so that they would be able to pay interest and principal on their loans. The committee&#x27;s findings did not achieve the aim of nationalization of the arms industry, but gave momentum to the non-interventionist movement, sparked the passage of the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s in 1935, 1936, 1937, and 1939, and encouraged Charles Lindbergh and other anti-Semites, who believed that the lenders were mostly Jewish and that Jews were one of the principal groups advocating for U.S. intervention in Europe.

In its final report, the Nye Committee also identified the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay as a key example of complicity between debt financiers, arms makers, and militaries. The Committee described the dynamic:

<doc id="539950" wikidata="Q955861" url="?curid=539950" title="Rondane National Park">
<text>Rondane National Park () is the oldest national park in Norway, established on 21 December 1962. The park is located in Innlandet county, in the municipalities of Dovre, Folldal, Sel, Nord-Fron, Sør-Fron, Stor-Elvdal, and Ringebu. The park contains ten peaks above , with the highest being Rondeslottet at an altitude of . The park is an important habitat for herds of wild reindeer.

The park was enlarged in 2003, and now covers an area of . Rondane lies just to the east of the Gudbrandsdalen valley and two other mountain areas, Dovre and Jotunheimen are nearby. Dovre National Park lies a very short distance to the north of this park.

==Geography==
Rondane is a typical high mountain area, with large plateaus and a total of ten peaks above . The highest point is Rondeslottet (&quot;The Rondane Castle&quot;) at an altitude of . The lowest point is just below the tree line, which is located at approximately above sea level. The climate is mild but relatively arid. Apart from the white birch trees of the lower areas, the soil and rocks are mostly covered by heather and lichen, due to a lack of nutrients. The largest mountains are almost entirely barren; above nothing but the hardiest lichens grow on the bare stones.

The mountains are divided by marked valleys through the landscape; the deepest valley is filled by Rondvatnet, a narrow lake filling the steep space between the large Storronden–Rondeslottet massif and Smiubelgen (&quot;The blacksmith&#x27;s bellows&quot;). The central massif is also cut by &quot;botns&quot;: flat, dead stone valleys below the steep mountain walls of the peaks. Generally, Rondane does not receive enough precipitation to generate persistent glaciers, but glacier-like heaps of snow can be found in the flat back valleys.

At the centre of the park lies the lake Rondvatnet, from which all the peaks above in elevation can be reached in less than one day&#x27;s walk. In the central and northern regions, the altitude is relatively high compared with the flatter plateaus of the south. Rondane has ten peaks over including: 

* Rondeslottet, 
* Storronden, 
* Høgronden, 
* Midtronden western summit, 
* Vinjeronden, 
* Midtronden eastern summit, 
* Trolltinden, 
* Storsmeden, 
* Digerronden, 
* Veslesmeden, 
In many parts of the park, there are spread-out holes (kettle holes) created by small remains of ice age glaciers, and peculiar small hills called &quot;eskers&quot; made by ground moraine released from melting glaciers.
==History==
===Prehistory===
The history of life in the area of the park begins at the end of the latest ice age. Large climate changes allowed reindeer to spread widely across Scandinavia, only to be forced back to a much smaller area — including the Rondane mountain area — only some hundreds of years later. Archaeologists have found that the forest quickly grew at high altitudes; birch trees found at were 8500 years old.

On the mountain plateau, there is evidence that nomadic hunter-gatherers lived off reindeer. Large traps used to catch reindeer can be found at Gravhø and Bløyvangen and are also spread throughout the park. These are constructed from stone to make holes or large fenced-in areas into which reindeer could be tricked or led.

Accompanying the substantial traps, smaller arched stone structures are presumed to have served as concealment for archers awaiting their targets. Dating techniques indicate that the oldest of these traps could be approximately 3500 years old. The majority of discoveries, encompassing residential ruins, are dated to the period spanning 500 to 700 AD.

It is thus known with confidence that the large traps and accompanying walls were used from the 6th century until the onset of the Black Death in the 14th century.

===Establishment===

After nearly a decade of planning, Rondane was established as the first Norwegian National Park on 21 December 1962. It was first established as a nature protection area, but was later named a national park. The main reasons for protecting the park were &quot;to safeguard the natural environment with its native plants, animal life, and cultural heritage and also to secure the environment as a recreational area for future generations&quot;.
Legal efforts to protect nature in Norway date from 1954, when the nature protection law was passed. Soon after, in 1955, community meetings were held in the municipalities close to Rondane, and a commission was founded. Norman Heitkøtter was president of the commission, and made it possible by Royal resolution to establish Rondane National Park. At its establishment, the park covered an area of (later, this was nearly doubled).

Although Rondane was the first national park in Norway, many others followed. The parks are maintained by the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management.

===2003 expansion===
As a special measure for the protection of the wild reindeer, the park was significantly enlarged in 2003, its area increasing from to . 

The expansion of the park primarily occurred towards the northwest, accompanied by moderate enlargements in the east and south. Furthermore, zones with reduced levels of protection, encompassing both landscape and nature conservation areas, were instituted in conjunction with the park.

A new national park, Dovre National Park, between Rondane and Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella National Park was also opened. Following the expansion, it is now only approximately from the northern border of Rondane to the southern border of Dovre National Park, and large sections of adjacent mountain areas are protected by the three parks.

==Geology==

The bedrock in Rondane comes from a shallow sea floor, created 500 to 600 million years ago. From this, changes in the Earth&#x27;s crust created a mountain area of metamorphic rock and quartz. There are no fossils found in Rondane today and so it is thought the sea where the rock came from contained no animal life.

The present landscape was mostly formed by the last ice age, nine to ten thousand years ago. During that period, significant amounts of ice accumulated, and it is theorized that this ice underwent gradual melting in alternating cycles of thawing and ice build-up.

The ice melting cycles occurred rapidly, digging deep river valleys.

Rondane contains a few small canyons which were created by the rapid ice melting, most prominently Jutulhogget and Vesle-Ula.

==Biology==
Rondane is one of the few places in Scandinavia and Europe where wild reindeer (as opposed to the domestic breed) are found. The Directorate for Nature Management regards Rondane as &quot;especially important as a life supporting area for the native reindeer&quot;. It is estimated that approximately 2000 to 4000 reindeer live in Rondane and the nearby Dovre area. To protect the reindeer population in their core area during , hiking trails have been moved. The park was also enlarged in 2003 to provide increased protection for the reindeer.

Other large game, including roe deer and elk (moose) are commonplace along the rims of the park and occasionally musk ox from Dovre can be seen. Wolverines, lynxes, and a small population of bears are also present, while wolves are rare.

The reindeer largely rely on the lichen and reindeer moss that grow together with heather and hardy grass on the quite arid and nutrient-poor stony plateaus. The lichen provide food for the reindeer, but also fertilize the earth, making it possible for less hardy plants to grow, and mice and lemmings to feed. One of the flower species to survive very well is the Glacier Crowfoot, found up to an elevation of .

==Tourism==

Visitors to Rondane National Park are permitted to engage in hiking and camping throughout the park, with the exception of areas immediately surrounding cabins. 

The park is a motor traffic-free zone, and it operates under minimal special regulations. Licensed individuals are granted the opportunity to fish and hunt within the park&#x27;s boundaries.
The Norwegian Mountain Touring Association (DNT) is an association that owns and manages a network of mountain cabins in the service of hikers. In Rondane, there is a central cabin by the southern end of Lake Rondvatnet, Rondvassbu. There is also Dørålseter and Bjørnhollia at the northern and eastern rims of the park. All three cabins are staffed, and provide food and limited accommodation (possible to book beforehand). There are also unstaffed cabins in the Park, like Eldåbu where a key is needed.

DNT also mark trails in the Park, with red Ts that are easy to spot. The T-trails lead the way cabin-to-cabin, as well as marking the path to some of the peaks close to Rondvatnet. Recently, some trails have moved slightly to avoid the core areas of the wild reindeer.

The service cabins are also open during the winter season, although they are sometimes only self-serviced off season. Ski trails are marked and sometimes prepared, either by DNT or some of the nearby hotels and skiing resorts.

==Rondane in literature==
The landscapes of Rondane have inspired many Norwegian writers. Probably the best-known work is Peer Gynt (1867), a play by Henrik Ibsen, which is partly set in Rondane:

:Act 2, Scene lV
:(Among the Ronde mountains. Sunset. Shining snowpeaks all around.
:Peer Gynt enters, dizzy and bewildered.)
:Peer
::&quot;Tower over tower arises!&lt;br&gt; Hei, what a glittering gate!&lt;br&gt; Stand! Will you stand! It&#x27;s drifting&lt;br&gt; further and further away!&lt;br&gt; &quot;
With this scene, Ibsen wrote Rondane into one of the 19th centuries better-known plays and made Rondane a symbol for Norway.

Peter Christen Asbjørnsen, writer and gatherer of Norwegian folk tales in the mid-19th century, collected many stories connected with Rondane, including Peer Gynt, the story that inspired Ibsen.

A third writer who set one of his famous works in Rondane is the poet Aasmund Olavsson Vinje with his poem &quot;Ved Rundarne&quot;.

==Name==
Rondane is the finite plural of the word &quot;rond&quot;. Several mountains in the area have the ending &quot;-ronden&quot; (Digerronden, Høgronden, Midtronden, Storronden and Vinjeronden), and this is the finite singular of the same word. The word &quot;rond&quot; was probably originally the name of the long and narrow lake Rondvatnet (&#x27;Rond water/lake&#x27;) - the mountains around it were then named after this lake. For the meaning see under Randsfjorden.

<doc id="539954" wikidata="Q207690" url="?curid=539954" title="Poyang Lake">
<text>Poyang Lake, also known by its Chinese name as Poyang Hu, is the largest freshwater lake in China. Located within Jiujiang Prefecture in Jiangxi Province, it is fed by the Gan, Xin, and Xiu rivers and flows northward into the Yangtze River through a channel.

The area of Poyang Lake fluctuates dramatically between the wet and dry seasons, but in recent years the size of the lake has been decreasing overall. In a normal year the area of the lake averages . In early 2012, drought, sand quarrying, and the practice of storing water at the Three Gorges Dam lowered the area of the lake to about . The lake provides a habitat for half a million migratory birds and is a favorite destination for birding.

During the winter, the lake becomes home to many migrating Siberian cranes, up to 90% of which spend the winter there.

==Formation==

Poyang Lake has also been called Pengli Lake () historically, but they are not the same. Before the Han dynasty, the Yangtze followed a more northerly course through what is now Longgan Lake whilst Pengli Marsh formed the lower reaches of the Gan River. The area that is now Poyang Lake was a plain along the Gan River. Around AD 400, the new more southerly course of the Yangtze River switched again, causing the Gan River to further back up and form Lake Poyang. The lake was named for Poyang County, which it flooded along with Haihun County, forcing a mass migration to Wucheng Township in what is now Yongxiu County. Wucheng thus became one of the great ancient townships of Jiangxi Province. This migration gave birth to the Chinese idiom, &quot;Drowning Haihun County gives rise to Wucheng Township&quot; (). Poyang was named for the earlier Po County of the Qin dynasty, in turn named for the city of Poyi () in the state of Chu.

Lake Poyang reached its greatest size during the Tang dynasty, when its area reached .

==Environmental issues==
=== Loss of wildlife ===
A fishing ban has been in place since 2002. In January 2020, China imposed a 10-year fishing moratorium on 332 sites along the Yangtze, including Poyang Lake to protect marine biodiversity.

In 2007 fears were expressed that China&#x27;s finless porpoise, locally known as the &quot;jiangzhu&quot; (&quot;river pig&quot;), a native of the lake along with other waters such as Dongting Lake, might follow the baiji, the Yangtze river dolphin, into extinction. Calls have been made for action to be taken to save the porpoise, of which there are about 1,400 left, with between 700 and 900 in the Yangtze, and another about 500 in Poyang and Dongting Lakes. 2007 population levels are less than half the 1997 levels, and the population is dropping at a rate of 7.3 percent per year.

Sand dredging has become a mainstay of local economic development in the last few years, and is an important source of revenue in the region that borders Poyang Lake. But at the same time, high-density dredging projects have been the principal cause of the death of the local wildlife population. Dredging makes the waters of the lake muddier, and the porpoises cannot see as far as they once could, and have to rely on their highly developed sonar systems to avoid obstacles and look for food. Large ships enter and leave the lake at the rate of two per minute and such a high density of shipping means the porpoises have difficulty hearing their food, and also cannot swim freely from one bank to the other.

Furthermore, construction of Poyang Lake Dam is expected to cause devastating effects on the remaining porpoises.

=== Shrinkage ===
Due to the Three Gorges Dam upriver on the Yangtze river, Poyang Lake can seasonally shrink and dry up.

In 2012, the lake nearly dried up completely. of land was underwater in October, while the lake is normally in area when full. In addition to the Three Gorges Dam, which must store water in its reservoir to be usable in winter, a drought was also blamed for the shrinkage.

The Jiangxi local government has proposed to build the Poyang Lake Dam to maintain water levels in the lake, building a sluice wall across the connection between the lake and the Yangtze river. An environmental impact assessment is pending. Scientists, as well as environmental groups such as the World Wide Fund for Nature, have criticized the proposal, arguing that artificially engineering water levels in the lake will adversely affect wildlife diversity.

==In history==
In 1363, the Battle of Lake Poyang took place there; the battle is claimed to be the largest naval battle in history.

<doc id="539957" wikidata="Q107001347" url="?curid=539957" title="Government of Northern Ireland">
<text>The government of Northern Ireland is, generally speaking, whatever political body exercises political authority over Northern Ireland. A number of separate systems of government exist or have existed in Northern Ireland.

Following the partition of Ireland, Northern Ireland was recognised as a separate territory within the authority of the British Crown on 3 May 1921, under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The new autonomous Northern Ireland was formed from six of the nine counties of Ulster, being four counties with unionist majorities (Antrim, Armagh, Down and Londonderry), and Fermanagh and Tyrone two of the five Ulster counties which had nationalist majorities. In large part unionists, at least in the north east region, supported its creation while nationalists were opposed. Subsequently, on 6 December 1922, the island of Ireland became an independent dominion known as the Irish Free State but Northern Ireland immediately exercised its right to &quot;opt out&quot; of the new Dominion.

The first government of Northern Ireland was the Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland, which exercised such authority from 1922 to 1972. A Northern Ireland Executive was created following the signing of the Sunningdale Agreement in 1974, while the current Northern Ireland Executive under the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, was created in the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement, and has intermittently been in existence from 1999 to the present. Northern Ireland has also been governed by ministers under the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during periods of Direct Rule.

<doc id="539959" wikidata="Q3559945" url="?curid=539959" title="Vincenzo Nardiello">
<text>Vincenzo Nardiello (born 11 June 1966) is a retired former world champion Italian boxer in the super middleweight division.

==Early life and amateur career==
Nardiello was born in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, West Germany. A former world champion in the super middleweight division, he and Roy Jones Jr. are best remembered as the two boxers who were controversially robbed of decisions against eventually Olympic light middleweight gold medalist Park Si-Hun in the last two rounds of the 1988 Olympics despite Nardiello and Jones clearly landing more punches in their bouts. Two of the judges in Jones versus Si-Hun finals were banned for life after the tournament, while the third admitted his card was a mistake, with Jones being named the outstanding fighter of the tournament. Si-Hun apologized and retired. The stain of the &#x27;bad decisions&#x27; in the 1988 Olympics stayed with Nardiello and Jones for the rest of their careers. 36 of 37 Americans got decisions in boxing in the 1984 Olympics in the United States, and the South Koreans had vowed to get back at the American media for being terribly wronged in 1984, and Nardiello and Jones were targets of the South Korean scorecards of the time. Nardiello, who lost a 3–2 split decision Park Si-Hun, felt he had been cheated, argued with the officials at ringside and had to be physically dragged from the Seoul Olympics ring area.

==Professional career==
Nardiello turned pro after the 1988 Olympics and won seventeen consecutive bouts. On 13 December 1991, Nardiello was stopped in the 11th round of his first world title bout by WBA Super Middleweight champion Victor Corboba in France. He then won and lost, regained and lost again the European Super Middleweight title in bouts in Italy and France. After knocking Massimiliano Bocchini in Italy, Nardiello again challenged for a world title, but was stopped in the eighth round of a London bout against WBC Super Middleweight champion Nigel Benn, in Benn&#x27;s first bout since his bout with Gerald McClellan who sustained critical injuries. Benn then lost his title to Thulani Malinga, lost his last three title bouts and retired in 1996. Nardiello qualified for another world title shot by knocking out Norberto Bueno in Italy. On 6 July 1996, in Manchester, England, Nardiello defeated WBC champion Thulani Malinga to win a share of the World Super Middleweight title in his third attempt. Nardiello lost the WBC title in Milan, Italy, later in 1996, when he was stopped by Robin Reid After winning three more bouts, Nardiello was unsuccessful in his final world title bout, getting stopped in the sixth round of a WBC World Super Middleweight title bout against Richie Woodhall (who had lost the &#x27;other&#x27; 1988 Olympics semi-final bout to Jones) on 13 February 1999. Nardiello retired after winning a six-round decision over Glenn Odem in Italy on 29 May 1999.

<doc id="539962" wikidata="Q523022" url="?curid=539962" title="Risk premium">
<text>A risk premium is a measure of excess return that is required by an individual to compensate being subjected to an increased level of risk. It is used widely in finance and economics, the general definition being the expected risky return less the risk-free return, as demonstrated by the formula below.

formula_1

Where formula_2 is the risky expected rate of return and formula_3 is the risk-free return.

The inputs for each of these variables and the ultimate interpretation of the risk premium value differs depending on the application as explained in the following sections. Regardless of the application, the market premium can be volatile as both comprising variables can be impacted independent of each other by both cyclical and abrupt changes. This means that the market premium is dynamic in nature and ever-changing. Additionally, a general observation regardless of application is that the risk premium is larger during economic downturns and during periods of increased uncertainty.

There are many forms of risk such as financial risk, physical risk, and reputation risk. The concept of risk premium can be applied to all these risks and the expected payoff from these risks can be determined if the risk premium can be quantified. In the equity market, the riskiness of a stock can be estimated by the magnitude of the standard deviation from the mean. If for example the price of two different stocks were plotted over a year and an average trend line added for each, the stock whose price varies more dramatically about the mean is considered the riskier stock. Investors also analyse many other factors about a company that may influence its risk such as industry volatility, cash flows, debt, and other market threats.

== Formal definition in expected utility theory ==
In expected utility theory, a rational agent has a utility function that maps sure-outcomes to numerical values, and the agent ranks gambles over sure-outcomes by their expected utilities.

Let the set of possible wealth-levels be formula_4. A gamble formula_5 is a real-valued random variable. The actuarial value of the gamble is just its expectation: formula_6. This is independent of any agent.

Let the agent have a utility function formula_7, with a wealth-level formula_8. The risk-premium of formula_5 for the agent at wealth-level formula_10 is formula_11, defined as the solution toformula_12

Note that the risk-premium depends both on the gamble itself, the agent&#x27;s utility function, and the wealth-level of the agent. This can be understood intuitively by considering a real gamble. Some people may be quite willing to take the gamble and thus have a low risk-premium, while others are more averse. Further, as one&#x27;s wealth increases, one is usually less perturbed by the gamble, whose stakes diminshes relative to one&#x27;s wealth, consequently the risk-premium formula_11 often decreases as formula_10 increases, holding formula_5 constant.

==Risk premium application in finance==
The risk premium is used extensively in finance in areas such as asset pricing, portfolio allocation and risk management. Two fundamental aspects of finance, being equity and debt instruments, require the use and interpretation of associated risk premiums with the inputs for each explained below:

=== Equity instruments ===
In the stock market the risk premium is the expected return of a company stock, a group of company stocks, or a portfolio of all stock market company stocks, minus the risk-free rate. The return from equity is the sum of the dividend yield and capital gains and the risk free rate can be a treasury bond yield.

For example, if an investor has a choice between a risk-free treasury bond with a bond yield of 3% and a risky company equity asset, the investor may require a greater return of 8% from the risky company. This would result in a risk premium of 5%. Individual investors set their own risk premium depending on their level of risk aversion. The formula can be rearranged to find the expected return on an investment given a stated risk premium and risk-free rate. For example, if the investor in the example above required a risk premium of 9% then the expected return on the equity asset would have to be 12%.

=== Debt instruments ===
The risk premium associated with bonds, known as the credit spread, is the difference between a risky bond and the risk free treasury bond with greater risk demanding a greater risk premium as compensation.

=== Risk premium application in banking ===
Risk premiums are essential to the banking sector and can provide a large amount of information to investors and customers alike. For instance, the risk premium for a savings account is determined by the bank through the interest that they set on their savings accounts for customers. This less the interest rate set by the central bank provides the risk premium. Stakeholders can interpret a large premium as an indication of increased default risk which has flow on effects such as negatively impacting the public&#x27;s confidence in the financial system which can ultimately lead to bank runs which is dangerous for an economy.

The risk premium is equally important for a bank&#x27;s assets with the risk premium on loans, defined as the loan interest charged to customers less the risk free government bond, needing to be sufficiently large to compensate the institution for the increased default risk associated with providing a loan.

=== Using the risk premium to produce valuations ===
One of the most important applications of risk premiums is to estimate the value of financial assets. There are a number of models used in finance to determine this with the most widely used being the Capital Asset Pricing Model or CAPM. CAPM uses investment risk and expected return to estimate a value for the investment. In Finance, CAPM is generally used to estimate the required rate of return for an equity. This required rate of return can then be used to estimate a price for the stock which can be done via a number of methods. The formula for CAPM is:

:CAPM = (The Risk Free Rate) +
::(The Beta of the Security) * (The Market Risk Premium)

In this model, we use the implied risk premium (market return less risk-free rate) and multiply this with the beta of the security. The beta of a security is the measure of a security&#x27;s volatility relative to the broader market to understand its historical share price movement compared to the market. If the beta of a stock is 1.0 then a 10% increase in the market will translate to a 10% increase in stock price. If the Beta of a stock is 1.5 then a 10% increase in the market will translate to a 15% increase in the stock price and if the beta of a stock is 0.5 a 10% market increase will translate to a 5% stock price increase and likewise with decreases in the market. This beta is generally found via statistical analysis of the share price history of a stock. Therefore CAPM aims to provide a simple model in order to estimate the required return of an investment which uses the theory of risk premiums. This helps to provide investors with a simple means of determining what return an investment should be relative to its risk.

== Risk premium application in managerial economics ==
The risk premium concept is equally applicable in managerial economics. The risk premium is largely correlated with risk aversion with the larger the risk aversion of an individual or business the larger the risk premium the party will be willing to pay to avoid the risk.

Regarding workers, the risk premium increases as the risk of injury increases and manifests in practice with average wages in dangerous jobs being higher for this reason. Another way in which the risk premium can be interpreted from the workers perspective is that risk is valued by the market, in the form of wage discrepancies between risky and less risky jobs, with a worker able to determine what amount they are willing to forgo to engage in a less risky job. In this instance the risk premium provides insight into the strength of correlation between risk and the average job type earnings with a larger premium potentially suggesting that there is a greater risk and/ or a lack of workers willing to take the risk.

The level of risk associated with the risk premium concept does not need to be physical risk but it can also incorporate risk surrounding the job, such as job security. Higher risk of unemployment  is compensated with a higher wage with this being a reason as to why fixed-term contracts generally include a higher wage. CEO&#x27;s in industries with high volatility are subject to increased risk of dismissal. Dismissed CEO&#x27;s often undergo a period of unemployment after dismissal and frequently settle for jobs in smaller firms with lower remuneration. Due to this, and assuming there is demand competition within the labor market, they often require a higher remuneration than CEO&#x27;s in non-volatile industries as a risk premium.

==In public goods==
===In invasive species management===
The option value of whether to invest in invasive species quarantine and/or management is a risk premium in some models.

==In agriculture==
===Of crop pathogens===
Farmers cope with crop pathogen risks and losses in various ways, mostly by trading off between management methods and pricing that includes risk premiums. For example in the northern United States, Fusarium head blight is a constant problem. Then in 2000 the release of a multiply-resistant cultivar of wheat dramatically reduced the necessary risk premium. The total planted area of MR wheats was dramatically expanded, due to this essentially costless tradeoff to the new cultivar.

===Of investment in genetic research===
Estimates of costs of research and development - including patent costs - of new crop genes and other agricultural biotechnologies must include the risk premium of those which do not ultimately obtain patent approval.

==Example of observed risk premium==
Suppose a game show participant may choose one of two doors, one that hides $1,000 and one that hides $0. Further, suppose that the host also allows the contestant to take $500 instead of choosing a door. The two options (choosing between door 1 and door 2, or taking $500) have the same expected value of $500, so no risk premium is being offered for choosing the doors rather than the guaranteed $500.

A contestant unconcerned about risk is indifferent between these choices. A risk-averse contestant will choose no door and accept the guaranteed $500, while a risk-loving contestant will derive utility from the uncertainty and will therefore choose a door.

If too many contestants are risk averse, the game show may encourage selection of the riskier choice (gambling on one of the doors) by offering a positive risk premium. If the game show offers $1,600 behind the good door, increasing to $800 the expected value of choosing between doors 1 and 2, the risk premium becomes $300 (i.e. $800 expected value minus $500 guaranteed amount). Contestants requiring a minimum risk compensation of less than $300 will choose a door instead of accepting the guaranteed $500.

== Empirical estimates of risk premium from securities markets ==

Schroeder estimated risk premiums ranging from 4.83 to 7.75 percent in securities markets in the United Kingdom and the European Union under multiple models, with most estimates ranging between 6.3 and 7.2 percent.

<text>An inoculation loop (also called a smear loop, inoculation wand or microstreaker) is a simple tool used mainly by microbiologists to pick up and transfer a small sample of microorganisms called from a microbial culture, e.g. for streaking on a culture plate. This process is called .

The tool consists of a thin handle with a loop about 5 mm wide or smaller at the end. It was originally made of twisted metal wire (such as platinum, tungsten or nichrome), but disposable molded plastic versions are now common. The size of the loop determines the volume of liquid an inoculation loop can transfer. An early report of the use of an inoculation loop as an analytical tool was by O&#x27;Sullivan &quot;et al.&quot; in a 1960 published protocol developed to improve methods for culturing urine samples. A 3mm diameter loop was used to deliver a consistent volume of urine for analysis. Loops can now be purchased to transfer volumes ranging from 1-10 microliters, though pipettes have replaced inoculation loops as more reliable tools to deliver small volumes of liquid.

<text>James Carroll Booker III (December 17, 1939 – November 8, 1983) was an American New Orleans rhythm and blues keyboardist and singer. Flamboyant in personality and style, and possessing extraordinary technical skill on the piano, he was dubbed &quot;the Black Liberace.&quot;

His 1960 recording &quot;Gonzo&quot; reached No. 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine record chart and No. 3 in R&amp;B, and he toured internationally in the 1970s. After being mainly a rhythm and blues artist, Booker later fused this genre with jazz and with popular music such as that of the Beatles, playing these in his signature backbeat. He profoundly influenced the New Orleans music scene, where his renditions and originals have been revived and are performed.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Booker&#x27;s father and paternal grandfather were Baptist ministers. Both were pianists. He was born in New Orleans on December 17, 1939, to Ora, née Cheatham and Rev. James &quot;Jimmie&quot; Harald Booker, a New Orleans Baptist church pastor and World War I army veteran. Nicknamed &quot;J.C.,&quot; Booker was a child prodigy, classically trained on piano from the age of six, and played the organ in his father&#x27;s churches. Due to Rev. Jimmie Booker&#x27;s health problems, Ora took her daughter Betty Jean (b. 1935) and son James to live near Ora&#x27;s sister, Eva Sylvester, in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, temporarily on several occasions. Those stays amounted to around half of Booker&#x27;s childhood up to the age of 8. He returned permanently to New Orleans in 1948, and enrolled in the fourth grade at a school where he befriended fellow students Art Neville, Charles Neville, and Allen Toussaint. By 1949, Booker&#x27;s parents had separated, and Ora remarried to Owen Champagne of New Orleans.

In 1949 at age 9, Booker was struck by an ambulance in New Orleans, that he said was traveling about 70 miles an hour. According to him, it dragged him for and broke his leg in eight places, nearly requiring its amputation. He was given morphine, which he later regarded as a cause of his eventual drug addiction. The accident left him with a permanent limp.

Booker received a saxophone for his 10th birthday in December 1949. He had asked for a trumpet, yet mastered the saxophone despite not having chosen it. But he focused on the piano, and by age 11 was performing blues and gospel organ every Sunday on the New Orleans radio station, WMRY (where his sister had performed). The following year was his last in classical instruction, when Booker learned the entire set of J.S. Bach&#x27;s Inventions and Sinfonias, performing these at a professional level by age 12.

Rev. Jimmie Booker died in 1953, the year that Booker began high school at Xavier University Preparatory School on Magazine Street. Ellis Marsalis Jr. was band director at the school at the time, and noted the highly advanced quality of Booker&#x27;s playing of Bach. Even as a working musician by his mid teens, he excelled at Xavier, especially in math, music, and Spanish, and graduated in 1957. He aspired to become a Catholic priest, yet gave up the idea, deciding to express his faith through music.

===Booker Groove===

As a classical pianist, Booker focused on music of Chopin, Rachmaninoff, and Ernesto Lecuona (for example, Malagueña), and memorized solos by Erroll Garner and Liberace.
He learned some elements of his keyboard style from Tuts Washington and Edward Frank, and was influenced by Professor Longhair and Ray Charles.
But another major influence, one who helped inspire Booker&#x27;s unique style, was Fats Domino. Booker developed a backbeat rhythm that resembles some of Domino&#x27;s piano playing. Domino and his drummer, Earl Palmer, are considered among the inventors of the early rock and roll backbeat. Booker&#x27;s version of this rhythm has been called the &quot;Booker groove&quot;. Joshua Paxton, however, a New Orleans–based pianist and transcriber of Booker&#x27;s solos, credits the groove to Booker, not mentioning Domino. Whatever its origin, Booker used this to substitute the original rhythm on a wide variety of popular and folk music. Many examples were New Orleans rhythm and blues, as &quot;Junco Partner&quot;, Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;All By Myself&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m in Love Again&quot;, Lloyd Price&#x27;s &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;, Earl King&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Better World,&quot; and it is the composed rhythm on some of Booker&#x27;s own pieces, including &quot;Pop&#x27;s Dilemma.&quot; A few were jazz standards, &quot;Tico-Tico&quot; and &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot;, but also pop rock, as in The Beatles&#x27; Eleanor Rigby, and country, Roger Miller&#x27;s &quot;King of the Road&quot;. In the Booker groove there are traces of blues, stride, gospel, and Latin music.

===1954 to 1976: Recording and touring===
Booker made his recording debut in 1954 at the age of 14, on Imperial Records, with &quot;Doin&#x27; the Hambone&quot; and &quot;Thinkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout My Baby&quot;, produced by Dave Bartholomew. While these were unsuccessful commercially, Bartholomew subsequently had Booker ghost on piano for Fats Domino, to combine his virtuosity with Domino&#x27;s popular singing. This collaboration would be repeated in the late 1960s. During the late 1950s, Booker adopted a flamboyant stage dress. In this way he emulated Little Richard as did Esquerita, both of whom recorded in New Orleans. In 1958, Arthur Rubinstein performed a concert in New Orleans. Afterwards, eighteen-year-old Booker was introduced to the concert pianist and played several pieces for him. Rubinstein was astonished, saying &quot;I could never play that ... never at that tempo&quot; (&quot;The Times-Picayune&quot;, 1958).

From the mid 1950s into the 1960s, Booker played with a series of blues and rhythm and blues bands as partly described in liner notes (by Bunny Matthews) to the album &quot;Classified&quot;. In interview, he said he &quot;recorded for Leonard Chess — I did &#x27;A Heavenly Angel&#x27; with Arthur Booker [no relation]. After that, I recorded for Johnny Vincent&#x27;s Ace Records. I played with Huey Smith and Shirley and Lee. When I graduated high school, I played with Joe Tex. I left Joe Tex to play with Huey Smith.&quot; Smith preferred not to be on the road, hence Booker replaced him when touring, and is even said to have impersonated Smith. Booker went on to record on piano with Larry Davis and his blues band in 1958, 1959, and 1960 in Houston, Texas. In January 1960 in Chicago, he recorded on piano with Junior Parker. He recorded on piano with Dave Bartholomew&#x27;s studio band and Earl King, when King recorded for Imperial records in New Orleans in 1960 and 1961. Booker recorded as pianist with Smiley Lewis in 1960 and 1961, on organ for Lloyd Price in 1963,
 and on piano for Shirley &amp; Lee in 1962 and 1963. In March 1962, Booker recorded four titles on the organ with Dave Bartholomew&#x27;s band in New Orleans, of which two were released.

In the early 1960s, Booker recorded a series of instrumental singles on organ for Peacock Records. These were &quot;Cool Turkey&quot; and &quot;Gonzo&quot; in 1960, &quot;Smacksie&quot; and &quot;Kinda Happy&quot; in 1960 and 1961, and &quot;Tubby,&quot; &quot;Cross my Heart&quot; and &quot;Big Nick,&quot; dates unknown between 1960 and 62.

In 1960, he enrolled as an undergraduate in Southern University&#x27;s music department, although he did not remain beyond the fall semester of that year. The professor of music at Southern complained of the pianist&#x27;s classroom antics. He insisted Booker omit his examination, and that &quot;I&#x27;ll grade him anyway; he keeps on disrupting my classes with all kinds of craziness and stuff.&quot; During the week of December 5, 1960, however, &quot;Gonzo&quot; reached number 43 on the United States (U.S.) record chart of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. It also reached number 3 on the R&amp;B record chart, and was a favorite song of the author Hunter Thompson. None of Booker&#x27;s other Peacock organ tracks enjoyed such fame. 

Booker continued to tour and performed at New Orleans nightclubs from 1960 until 1967. Yet he experienced a series of tragedies in the mid 1960s, all during a period of two years. In September 1966, his sister died, at a time when Booker was compelled to go on touring despite this event, compounding loss with a lack of opportunity to mourn. His mother died the following year, in June 1967. Within weeks of her death, he was arrested outside the Dew Drop Inn hotel and nightclub for possession of heroin, which he had begun using earlier in the sixties. Being convicted, Booker served a one-year sentence in Angola Prison, where he lost his left eye in an assault. After his release in 1968, he resumed session work in New Orleans, including recording with Fats Domino. In July 1968, he recorded with Freddie King in New York City, tracks that were released in 1969 and 1970.

As Booker became more familiar with law enforcement in New Orleans due to his drug use, he formed a relationship with District Attorney Harry Connick Sr., who was occasionally Booker&#x27;s legal counsel. Connick would discuss law with Booker during his visits to the Connick home and made an arrangement with the musician whereby a prison sentence would be nullified in exchange for piano lessons for Connick Sr.&#x27;s son, Harry Connick Jr.

In 1973, Booker recorded &quot;The Lost Paramount Tapes&quot; at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, California, U.S. with members of the Dr. John band, which included John Boudreaux on drums, Jessie Hill on percussion, Alvin Robinson on guitar and vocals, Richard &quot;Didymus&quot; Washington on percussion, David Lastie on sax, and David L. Johnson on bass guitar. The album was produced by former Dr. John band member David L. Johnson and by singer-songwriter Daniel Moore. The master tapes disappeared from the Paramount Recording Studios library, but a copy of the mixes that were made around the time of the recordings was discovered in 1992, which resulted in a CD release on DJM Records.

Booker then played organ in Dr. John&#x27;s Bonnaroo Revue touring band in 1974, and also appeared as a sideman on albums by Ringo Starr, John Mayall, The Doobie Brothers, Labelle and Geoff Muldaur throughout this period.

Booker&#x27;s performance at the 1975 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival earned a recording contract for him with Island Records. His album with Island, &quot;Junco Partner&quot;, was produced by Joe Boyd, who had previously recorded Booker on sessions for Muldaur&#x27;s records. In January 1976, Booker briefly joined the Jerry Garcia Band, playing two Palo Alto, California shows where Garcia was &quot;backing up ... Booker on most numbers.&quot;

===1976 to 1978: Success in Europe===
Several concerts from Booker&#x27;s 1977 and 1978 European tours were professionally recorded, and some were also filmed for television broadcast. Multiple albums were released from these recordings on a number of record labels. The album &quot;New Orleans Piano Wizard: Live!&quot;, which was recorded at his performance at the &quot;Boogie Woogie and Ragtime Piano Contest&quot; in Zürich, Switzerland, won the Grand Prix du Disque. He also played at the Nice and Montreux Jazz Festivals in 1978 and recorded a session for the BBC during this time. A recording entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Make A Better World!&quot;—made in Leipzig during this period—became the last record to be produced in the former East Germany.

In a 2013 interview, filmmaker Lily Keber, who directed a documentary on Booker, provided her perspective on Booker&#x27;s warm reception in European nations such as Germany and France:
Well, the racism wasn&#x27;t there, the homophobia wasn&#x27;t there—as much. Even the drug use was a little more tolerated. But really I think that Booker felt he was being taken seriously in Europe, and it made him think of himself differently and improved the quality of his music. He needed the energy of the audience to feed off.

Keber further explained that Europeans refer to jazz as &quot;the art of the twentieth century&quot; and suggests that the &quot;classical tradition&quot; that is present in the continent led to a greater understanding of Booker among audiences. Keber states that Booker was &quot;concert-hall worthy&quot; to European jazz lovers.

===1978 to 1983: Return to the U.S.===
From 1978 to 1982, Booker was the house pianist at the Maple Leaf Bar in the Carrollton neighborhood of uptown New Orleans. Recordings during this time, made by John Parsons, were released as &quot;Spiders on the Keys&quot; and &quot;Resurrection of the Bayou Maharajah&quot;. Following his success in Europe, Booker was forced to adjust to a lower level of public recognition, as he performed in cafes and bars. Keber believes this shift was &quot;devastating&quot; to Booker, as he was aware of his own talent.

Booker&#x27;s last commercial recording, made in 1982, was titled &quot;Classified&quot; and, according to producer Scott Billington, was completed in four hours. By this time, Booker&#x27;s physical and mental condition had deteriorated. He was also subject to the social stigma that affected people who used illicit drugs and those with mental health issues during this era of American history.

At the end of October 1983, filmmaker Jim Gabour captured Booker&#x27;s final concert performance for a series on the New Orleans music scene. The series, entitled &quot;Music City&quot;, was broadcast on Cox Cable and included footage from the Maple Leaf Bar in New Orleans and a six-and-a-half-minute improvisation called &quot;Seagram&#x27;s Jam.&quot;

===Death===
Booker died aged 43 on November 8, 1983, while seated in a wheelchair in the emergency room at New Orleans&#x27; Charity Hospital, waiting to receive medical attention. The cause of death, as cited in the Orleans Parish Coroner&#x27;s Death Certificate, was renal failure related to chronic abuse of heroin and alcohol.

==Posthumous tributes==
Booker&#x27;s death was mourned by music lovers and numerous admirers have emerged in the time since. Harry Connick Jr., Henry Butler, and Dr. John, among others, recorded songs with titles and musical styles referencing Booker. Connick explained his mentor&#x27;s piano-playing style in an interview: &quot;Nothing was harder than that. It&#x27;s insane. It&#x27;s insanity.&quot; and called him &quot;the greatest ever.&quot;

Dr. John described Booker as &quot;the best black, gay, one-eyed junkie piano genius New Orleans has ever produced.&quot;

Transcriptions by Joshua Paxton (with Tom McDermott and Andy Fielding) of Booker&#x27;s playing are available in &quot;The James Booker Collection&quot; and &quot;New Orleans Piano Legends&quot;, both published by the Hal Leonard Corporation. Paxton explained the significance of Booker in a 2013 interview:
From a musician&#x27;s perspective or piano player&#x27;s perspective, he matters because he figured out how to do things no one had ever done before, at least in a rhythm-and-blues context... Basically he figured out ways to do a lot of stuff at the same time and make the piano sound like an entire band. It&#x27;s Ray Charles on the level of Chopin. It&#x27;s all the soul, all the groove, and all the technique in the universe packed into one unbelievable player ... I can now say with certainty that it&#x27;s a pianistic experience unlike any other. He invented an entirely new way of playing blues and roots-based music on the piano, and it was mind-blowingly brilliant and beautiful.

The influential New Orleans musician, composer, and producer Allen Toussaint also praised Booker, applying the term &quot;genius&quot; to him:
There are some instances in his playing that are very unusual and highly complex, but the groove is never sacrificed. Within all the romping and stomping in his music, there were complexities in it that, if one tried to emulate it, what you heard and what excited you on the surface was supported by some extreme technical acrobatics finger-wise that made his music extraordinary as far as I&#x27;m concerned. And most of all, it always felt wonderful ... He was an extraordinary musician, both soul wise and groove wise ... He was just an amazing musician.

Booker&#x27;s vocal ability is also a subject that has been covered since his death. New Orleans pianist Tom McDermott, who has also studied the work of Booker, stated that he is &quot;so moved&quot; by Booker&#x27;s vocals, as &quot;you could feel the desperation in a way that few singers could impart.&quot; McDermott believes that Booker&#x27;s skillful combination of vocal virtuosity with a magnificent emotional power superseded the singing of Frank Sinatra.

&quot;Patchwork: A Tribute to James Booker&quot; is a 2003 release consisting of a compilation of his songs, performed by various pianists. Released in 2007, &quot;Manchester &#x27;77&quot; consists of a live performance recorded in October 1977 at The Lake Side Hotel, Belle Vue, Manchester, UK, with the Norman Beaker Band in support for two songs. In late 2013, Rounder Records announced the forthcoming release of a double-CD deluxe version of &quot;Classified&quot;, Booker&#x27;s final studio recordings.

Writing for PopMatters in 2014, George de Stefano said: &quot;And then there&#x27;s James Booker, whose stature in New Orleans musical history can be gauged by the various nicknames bestowed on the gifted, troubled, openly gay musician: the Bayou Maharajah (the title of a new documentary film about the pianist), the Piano Pope, the Ivory Emperor, the Piano Prince of New Orleans. Booker himself coined at least one of these monikers—the Bronze Liberace.&quot;

==&quot;Bayou Maharajah: The Tragic Genius of James Booker&quot;==
A feature-length documentary about Booker titled &quot;Bayou Maharajah: The Tragic Genius of James Booker&quot;, directed by Lily Keber, premiered at the SXSW festival on March 14, 2013. Keber raised funds on the Kickstarter website to complete the film, as she needed to cover licensing costs to include all of the &quot;concert footage, home movie, funky photo and unreleased audio&quot; that she uncovered across the U.S. and Europe. Between December 2012 and January 2013, the Kickstarter campaign received US$18,323 from 271 backers—Keber&#x27;s goal was US$15,000—who responded to the director&#x27;s motivation: &quot;After so many years of simmering in obscurity, it&#x27;s time for James Booker to be introduced to the world!&quot;

The film documents Booker&#x27;s life, from his Baptist upbringing through to his solitary death at Charity Hospital. In addition to coverage of Booker&#x27;s significant influence upon Connick and his collaborations with prominent artists, Keber also documents the musician&#x27;s heroin use and the deterioration in his mental health. In its review of the documentary, &quot;All About Jazz&quot; refers to Booker as a &quot;jazz genius&quot;. Worldwide distribution of the film was undertaken by Cadiz music on August 6, 2016. As of September 1, 2016, the film is available for streaming on Amazon.com and Netflix. The DVD was released on October 14, 2016, in Europe and North America.

Keber&#x27;s film was shown in May 2013—in the &quot;Golden Rock Documentary&quot; category—at the Little Rock Film Festival that is held annually on the banks of the Arkansas River in Little Rock, Arkansas. The &quot;Oxford American&quot; magazine bestowed the 2013 Best Southern Film Award to Keber at the Little Rock festival and praised the film as &quot;one of the most culturally important documentaries made in recent years&quot;. Keber explained her introduction to Booker in a subsequent &quot;Oxford American&quot; interview:
When I played Booker&#x27;s album, the first thing that I noticed was what bizarre song titles it had—stuff like &quot;Coquette&quot; and &quot;Piano Salad.&quot; I didn&#x27;t know what &quot;piano salad&quot; meant. I had no idea what to make of the music either. I know how to listen to something like the Neville Brothers or Irma Thomas, but Booker&#x27;s music I didn&#x27;t even know how to listen to. It was like a different language.

In June and August 2013, the film was part of the program of the Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF) and producer Nathaniel Kohn attended as a representative. Kohn participated in a brief interview and explained the importance of the research process:
Research was key to discovering Booker and his music. He died in 1983 and many of the people who knew him are either dead or reaching that certain age when memories start to fade. So we talked to a lot of people and those conversations led to boxes of old photographs and tapes, video and music libraries in the States and in Europe, and the vaults of television stations, record companies, and museums. Over three years of research went into this production.

Keber&#x27;s documentary was also the opening night film at the Southern Screen Film Festival in Lafayette, Louisiana, on November 14, 2013. A question and answer (Q&amp;A) session with Keber followed the screening.

<text>Jerzy Andrzejewski (; 19 August 1909 – 19 April 1983) was a prolific Polish writer. His works confront controversial moral issues such as betrayal, the Jews and Auschwitz in the wartime. His novels, &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot; (about the immediate post-war situation in Poland), and &quot;Holy Week&quot; (treating the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising), have been made into film adaptations by the Oscar-winning Polish director Andrzej Wajda. &quot;Holy Week&quot; and &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot; have both been translated into English. His novel &quot;The Gates of Paradise&quot; was translated into English by James Kirkup and published by Panther Books with the anglicised spelling &quot;George Andrzeyevski&quot;.

==Life and career==
Born in Warsaw in 1909, Andrzejewski studied philology at the University of Warsaw in the Second Polish Republic. In 1932 he debuted in &quot;ABC Magazine&quot; with his first short story entitled &quot;Wobec czyjegoś życia&quot;. In 1936 he published a full collection of short stories called &quot;Drogi nieuniknione&quot;, in &quot;Biblioteka Prosto z mostu&quot;, and soon received broad recognition for his new, Catholic-inspired novel &quot;Ład serca&quot; from 1938.

During World War II he was involved in efforts to aid the Jewish refugees. His short novel &quot;Holy Week&quot; (1945) has been described as &quot;arguably the first literary attempt to examine the behavior of Poles facing the Holocaust&quot;.

Immediately after World War II, Andrzejewski published the volume &quot;Night&quot; (&quot;Noc&quot;, 1945) and his most famous novel so far, &quot;Ashes and Diamonds&quot; (&quot;Popiół i diament&quot;, 1948). Having joined the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR) in 1950, he left the party after the 1956 Polish October protests and riots. After the suppression of the Prague Spring, in which Polish troops participated, Andrzejewski wrote a letter of apology to Eduard Goldstücker, the chairman of the Czechoslovak Writers Union. In 1964 he was one of the signatories of the so-called Letter of 34 to Prime Minister Józef Cyrankiewicz regarding freedom of culture. In 1976 Andrzejewski was one of the founding members of the intellectual opposition group KOR (&quot;Workers&#x27; Defence Committee&quot;). Later, Andrzejewski was a strong supporter of Poland&#x27;s anti-Communist Solidarity movement.

Andrzejewski was gay.

Although he was frequently considered a front-runner for the Nobel Prize for Literature, he never received the honor. His purported alcoholism in his later years may have hindered his literary output, thus preventing him from ever becoming a true moral authority.

He died of a heart attack in Warsaw in 1983.

==Legacy==
Andrzejewski&#x27;s wartime writings, which inspired the Anti-Nazi Home Army, and in turn his post-war work as a propagandist for Stalinism in Poland are analyzed in Czesław Miłosz&#x27;s &quot;The Captive Mind&quot;. In that book, Miłosz refers to Andrzejewski only as &quot;Alpha.&quot; According to Miłosz, Andrzejewski&#x27;s writing is &quot;sainted and supercilious,&quot; and other poets and writers in postwar Poland considered him a &quot;respectable prostitute.&quot;

On 23 September 2006, Jerzy Andrzejewski was posthumously awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta by Polish President Lech Kaczyński.

<doc id="539981" wikidata="Q6928762" url="?curid=539981" title="Mr. II">
<text>Joseph Mbilinyi (born 1 May 1972), known for his stage names Mr. II, Sugu and 2-proud, is a Tanzanian politician, human rights activist and rapper. He was a Mbeya Urban elected member of Parliament from 2010 to 2020.

Mr. II was stems from Mbeya in Southern highlands Tanzania, started to rap in 1990, in his youth when he was still in school. His inspirations were Ice Cube, Niggaz With Attitude and above all Tupak Shakur. Mr. II was the first Tanzanian rap artist to have major success with his music. Through his music and language he express and addresses politics, social inequalities and other problems that affected Tanzanians. Most would consider his music as a voice for the voiceless, his brand of rap is soulful, lyrical, rhythmical and from the heart. This is because Mr. II is not afraid to tell it like it is, undertaking sensitive issues of concern to many Tanzanians such as democracy, child prostitution, police brutality and corruption.

He became so popular that his music reached audiences even in rural areas where rap had not been heard before. Due to the quality of his music and the message in his music, older people were more acceptance to his music and contributed to making him the first Tanzanian rapper to have a mainstream hit. Also making Mr II the M-Net Best Male Artist Grammy Award Winner for Tanzania in 2001. Mr. II is the African Great Lakes region&#x27;s most popular Bongo Flava icon, and through this genre he was able to make a difference and create opportunities for the youth.

==Style and message==
Sugu, which loosely translates to &#x27;Stubborn&#x27; or &#x27;Hard&#x27;, has been just that in terms of his popular longevity. With over a decade of success, Sugu has maintained his rebellious persona as a social outcast. Performing in Swahili, Sugu addresses social issues that plague both urban and rural peoples in the African Great Lakes region. His socially conscious lyrics touch on issues ranging from prostitution to immigration to the plight of street children. Examples of his politically charged music is apparent in the songs &quot;Hali Halisi,&quot; (real situation) in which he depicts the struggles of street life, and the oppressive conditions of the government, prisons, and judicial system.

&quot;Everyday is us against the police and the police against us

The judge at the court is waiting for us

The prison officer is waiting for us

His lyrical style which is methodic yet quick has been mimicked by many of the genre&#x27;s newcomers. His peers view “his observant narratives, canny wordplay and flamboyant delivery” as a trademark of their genre.

Mr. II is an outspoken advocate of Tanzanian hiphop or Bongo Flava.

Sugu has seen success in various realms of the African Hip Hop scene. He is the primary organiser of the annual Tanzania Hip-Hop Summit, a yearly convention of the African Great Lakes region&#x27;s most prominent and up-and-coming music stakeholders. The summit is held in Dar es Salaam in December and brings together everyone from artists to producers to TV representatives. He was also the publisher of Deiwaka, a music and arts magazine that is no longer in print. Sugu is one of the most recognisable artists in the regional Hip-hop scene, has won numerous Pan-African music awards and has performed at a number of international festivals. Regardless of his efforts to differentiate himself and his genre, Mr. II continues to be compared to the many great Hip-Hop artists from the U.S. such as Nas, Jay-Z or Run DMC.

Mr. II&#x27;s song &quot;Haki&quot; has been hailed as the &quot;definitive bongoflava anthem&quot;. In Swahili Haki means freedom and justice Mr. II&#x27;s lyrics address themes that are typical of Bongoflava. Bongoflava &quot;tackle[s] subjects faced by the continent and the world over: poverty, ambition, success, money, HIV/AIDS&quot;

Sugu is also the Founder and Director of Deiwaka Entertainment, A company that has dedicated itself in promoting and developing Tanzanian hiphop/Bongoflava as part of helping in the fight against poverty and unemployment problems among youths in Tanzania. This company now has a website: Deiwakaworld

At the 2005 Tanzania Music Awards his album &quot;Moto Chini&quot; was nominated in the best Hip Hop Album category.

==Politics==
At the 2010 Tanzanian general elections, Mr. II successfully vied for Mbeya Urban constituency parliamentary seat for CHADEMA

<doc id="539988" wikidata="Q1068312" url="?curid=539988" title="Knowledge argument">
<text>The knowledge argument (also known as Mary&#x27;s Room, Mary the Colour Scientist, or Mary the super-scientist) is a philosophical thought experiment proposed by Frank Jackson in his article &quot;Epiphenomenal Qualia&quot; (1982), and extended in &quot;What Mary Didn&#x27;t Know&quot; (1986). 

The experiment describes Mary, a scientist who exists in a black-and-white world where she has extensive access to physical descriptions of color, but no actual perceptual experience of color. Mary has learned everything there is to learn about color, but she has never actually experienced it for herself. The central question of the thought experiment is whether Mary will gain new knowledge when she goes outside of the colorless world and experiences seeing in color.

The experiment is intended to argue against physicalism—the view that the universe, including all that is mental, is entirely physical. Jackson says that the &quot;irresistible conclusion&quot; is that &quot;there are more properties than physicalists talk about&quot;. Jackson would eventually call himself a physicalist and say, in 2023, &quot;I no longer accept the argument&quot; though he still feels that the argument should be &quot;addressed really seriously if you are a physicalist&quot;.

The debate that emerged following its publication became the subject of an edited volume, &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; (2004), which includes replies from such philosophers as Daniel Dennett, David Lewis, and Paul Churchland.

== Thought experiment ==
Mary is the second character put forward by Jackson in his article &quot;Epiphenomenal Qualia&quot;. The other is a gifted person called &quot;Fred&quot; who &quot;has better colour vision than anyone else on record&quot;; specifically, Fred can see two different colours of red where ordinary colour vision only sees one.

The thought experiment was originally proposed by Jackson as follows:

There is disagreement about how to summarize the premises and conclusion of Jackson&#x27;s argument in this thought experiment. Paul Churchland did as follows:

# Mary knows everything there is to know about brain states and their properties.
# It is not the case that Mary knows everything there is to know about sensations and their properties.
# Therefore, sensations and their properties are not the same (≠) as the brain states and their properties.

However, Jackson opposes it by saying that Churchland&#x27;s formulation is not his intended argument. He especially objects to the first premise of Churchland&#x27;s formulation: &quot;The whole thrust of the knowledge argument is that Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to know about brain states and their properties because she does not know about certain qualia associated with them. What is complete, according to the argument, is her knowledge of matters physical.&quot; He suggests his preferred interpretation:

# Mary (before her release) knows everything physical there is to know about other people.
# Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to know about other people (because she learns something about them on her release).
# Therefore, there are truths about other people (and herself) which escape the physicalist story.

Later on, Amy Kind proposes another summary for the argument:

# While in the room, Mary has acquired all the physical facts there are about color sensations, including the sensation of seeing red.
# When Mary exits the Room and sees a ripe red tomato, she learns a new fact about the sensation of seeing red, namely its subjective character.
# Therefore, there are non-physical facts about color sensations. [From 1, 2]
# If there are non-physical facts about color sensations, then color sensations are non-physical events.
# Therefore, color sensations are non-physical events. [From 3, 4]
# If color sensations are non-physical events, then physicalism is false.
# Therefore, physicalism is false. [From 5, 6]

== Background ==
Jackson says there are quite a few similar arguments that predate his formulation, even going back as far as John Locke.

C. D. Broad, Herbert Feigl, and Thomas Nagel, over a fifty-year span, presented insight to the subject. Broad makes the following remarks, describing a thought experiment where an archangel has unlimited mathematical competences:

In 1958, Feigl theorized that a hypothetical Martian, studying human behavior, will lack human sentiments.

Nagel&#x27;s essay, What Is It Like to Be a Bat? takes a slightly different approach. He takes the perspective of humans attempting to understand the echolocation capabilities of bats. Even with the entire physical database at one&#x27;s fingertips, humans would not be able to fully perceive or understand a bat&#x27;s sensory system, namely what it is like to &quot;see&quot; the world through sound.

== Implications ==
Whether Mary learns something new upon experiencing color has two major implications: the existence of qualia and the knowledge argument against physicalism.

=== Qualia ===
If Mary learns something new upon seeing red, it shows that qualia (the subjective, qualitative properties of experiences, conceived as wholly independent of behavior and disposition) exist. Therefore, it must be conceded that qualia are real, since there is a difference between a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.

=== Refutation of physicalism ===
Jackson argues further, saying that if Mary does learn something new upon experiencing color, then physicalism is false. Specifically, the knowledge argument is an attack on the physicalist claim about the completeness of physical explanations of mental states. Mary may know everything about the science of color perception, but can she know what the experience of red is like if she has never seen red? Jackson contends that, yes, she has learned something new, via experience, and hence, physicalism is false. Jacks
=== Epiphenomenalism ===
Jackson believed in the explanatory completeness of physiology, that all behaviour is caused by physical forces of some kind. And the thought experiment seems to prove the existence of qualia, a non-physical part of the mind. Jackson argued that if both of these theses are true, then epiphenomenalism is true—the view that mental states are caused by physical states, but have no causal effects on the physical world.
Thus, at the conception of the thought experiment, Jackson was an epiphenomenalist.

== Responses ==
Objections have been raised that have required the argument to be refined. Doubters cite various holes in the thought experiment that have arisen through critical examination.

Nemirow and Lewis present the &quot;ability hypothesis&quot;, and Conee argues for the &quot;acquaintance hypothesis&quot;. Both approaches attempt to demonstrate that Mary &quot;gains no new knowledge, but instead gains something else&quot;. If she in fact gains no new propositional knowledge, they contend, then what she does gain may be accounted for within the physicalist framework. These are the two most notable objections to Jackson&#x27;s thought experiment, and the claim it sets out to make.

=== Design of the thought experiment ===
Some have objected to Jackson&#x27;s argument on the grounds that the scenario described in the thought experiment itself is not possible. For example, Evan Thompson questioned the premise that Mary, simply by being confined to a monochromatic environment, would not have any color experiences, since she may be able to see color when dreaming, after rubbing her eyes, or in afterimages from light perception. However, Graham and Horgan suggest that the thought experiment can be refined to account for this: rather than situating Mary in a black and white room, one might stipulate that she was unable to experience color from birth, but was given this ability via medical procedure later in life. Nida-Rümelin recognizes that one might question whether this scenario would be possible given the science of color vision (although Graham and Horgan suggest it is), but argues it is not clear that this matters to the efficacy of the thought experiment, provided we can at least conceive of the scenario taking place.

Objections have also been raised that, even if Mary&#x27;s environment were constructed as described in the thought experiment, she would not, in fact, learn something new if she stepped out of her black and white room to see the color red. Daniel Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew &quot;everything about color&quot;, that knowledge would necessarily include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the &quot;qualia&quot; of color. Moreover, that knowledge would include the ability to functionally differentiate between red and other colors. Mary would therefore already know exactly what to expect of seeing red, before ever leaving the room. Dennett argues that functional knowledge is identical to the experience, with no ineffable &quot;qualia&quot; left over. J. Christopher Maloney argues similarly: If, as the argument allows, Mary does understand all that there is to know regarding the physical nature of colour vision, she would be in a position to imagine what colour vision would be like. It would be like being in physical state Sk, and Mary knows all about such physical states. Of course, she herself has not been in Sk, but that is no bar to her knowing what it would be like to be in Sk. For she, unlike us, can describe the nomic relations between Sk and other states of chromatic vision...Give her a precise description in the notation of neurophysiology of a colour vision state, and she will very likely be able to imagine what such a state would be like. Surveying the literature on Jackson&#x27;s argument, Nida-Rümelin identifies, however, that many simply doubt the claim that Mary would not gain new knowledge upon leaving the room, including physicalists who do not agree with Jackson&#x27;s conclusions. Most cannot help but admit that &quot;new information or knowledge comes her way after confinement,&quot; enough that this view &quot;deserves to be described as the received physicalist view of the Knowledge Argument.&quot;

Some philosophers have also objected to Jackson&#x27;s first premise by arguing that Mary could not know all the physical facts about color vision prior to leaving the room. Owen Flanagan argues that Jackson&#x27;s thought experiment &quot;is easy to defeat&quot;. He grants that &quot;Mary knows everything about color vision that can be expressed in the vocabularies of a complete physics, chemistry, and neuroscience&quot;, and then distinguishes between &quot;metaphysical physicalism&quot; and &quot;linguistic physicalism&quot;: Metaphysical physicalism simply asserts that what there is, and all there is, is physical stuff and its relations. Linguistic physicalism is the thesis that everything physical can be expressed or captured in the languages of the basic sciences…Linguistic physicalism is stronger than metaphysical physicalism and less plausible. Flanagan argues that, while Mary has all the facts that are expressible in &quot;explicitly physical language&quot;, she can only be said to have all the facts if one accepts linguistic physicalism. A metaphysical physicalist can simply deny linguistic physicalism and hold that Mary&#x27;s learning what seeing red is like, though it cannot be expressed in language, is nevertheless a fact about the physical world, since the physical is all that exists. Similarly to Flanagan, Torin Alter contends that Jackson conflates physical facts with &quot;discursively learnable&quot; facts, without justification: ...some facts about conscious experiences of various kinds cannot be learned through purely discursive means. This, however, does not yet license any further conclusions about the nature of the experiences that these discursively unlearnable facts are about. In particular, it does not entitle us to infer that these experiences are not physical events. Nida-Rümelin argues in response to such views that it is &quot;hard to understand what it is for a property or a fact to be physical once we drop the assumption that physical properties and physical facts are just those properties and facts that can be expressed in physical terminology.&quot;

=== The three strategies ===
Kind brings up three strategies that have been brought up in reaction to this argument: the ability analysis, the acquaintance analysis, and the old fact/new guise analysis.

==== Ability hypothesis ====
Several objections to the argument have been raised on the grounds that Mary does not gain new factual knowledge when she leaves the room, but rather a new ability. Nemirow claims that &quot;knowing what an experience is like is the same as knowing how to imagine having the experience&quot;. He argues that Mary only obtained the ability to do something, not the knowledge of something new. Lewis put forth a similar argument, claiming that Mary gained an ability to &quot;remember, imagine and recognize.&quot; In the response to Jackson&#x27;s knowledge argument, they both agree that Mary makes a genuine discovery when she sees red for the first time, but deny her discovery involves coming to know some facts of which she was not already cognizant before her release. Therefore, what she obtained is a discovery of new abilities rather than new facts; her discovery of what it is like to experience color consists merely in her gaining new ability of how to do certain things, but not gaining new factual knowledge. In light of such considerations, Churchland distinguishes between two senses of knowing, &quot;knowing how&quot; and &quot;knowing that&quot;, where knowing how refers to abilities and knowing that refers to knowledge of facts. He aims to reinforce this line of objection by appealing to the different locations in which each type of knowledge is represented in the brain, arguing that there is a true, demonstratively physical distinction between them. By distinguishing that Mary does not learn new facts, simply abilities, it helps to negate the problem posed by the thought experiment to the physicalist standpoint.

In response, Levin argues that a novel color experience does in fact yield new factual knowledge, such as &quot;information about the color&#x27;s similarities and compatibilities with other colors, and its effect on other of our mental states.&quot; Tye counters that Mary could have (and would have, given the stipulations of the thought experiment) learned all such facts prior to leaving the room, without needing to experience the color firsthand. For example, Mary could know the fact &quot;red is more like orange than green&quot; without ever experiencing the colors in question.

One might accept Conee&#x27;s arguments that imaginative ability is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to see a color, but preserve a version of the ability hypothesis that employs an ability other than imagination. For example, Brie Gertler discusses the option that what Mary gains is not an ability to imagine colors, but an ability to recognize colors by their phenomenal quality.

Kind offers a concrete and more realistic example: a driving test, where a person would have to complete a written test where their knowledge of road laws and facts will be tested, as well as an in-car exam, where they must display their ability to drive correctly while following the laws they know as well as putting their facts into practice. One can have all the knowledge-that (knowing all the safety rules related to driving) while having no knowledge-how (driving safely). Kind characterizes Mary&#x27;s understanding of color sensation as what it&#x27;s like knowledge, a sub-category of knowledge-that. She states that while Mary does learn something upon seeing the red tomato for the first time and gains knowledge-how; David Lewis claims Mary is now able to recognize, remember and imagine seeing the color red. Advocates of the ability analysis hold the belief that while Mary may have a surprised reaction to seeing red for the first time, she doesn&#x27;t gain any new facts about the sensation of red.

==== Acquaintance hypothesis ====
The acquaintance analysis argues that Mary is able to learn something new without obtaining accurate knowledge. Due to his dissatisfaction with the ability hypothesis, Earl Conee presents another variant. Conee&#x27;s acquaintance hypothesis describes a third category of knowledge &quot;by acquaintance of an experience&quot;.

Tye also defends a version of the acquaintance hypothesis that he compares to Conee&#x27;s, though he clarifies that acquaintance with a color should not be equated to applying a concept to one&#x27;s color experience.

In Conee&#x27;s account, one can come to know (be acquainted with) a phenomenal quality only by experiencing it, but not by knowing facts about it as Mary did. This is different from other physical objects of knowledge: one comes to know a city, for example, simply by knowing facts about it. For example: A person may know facts about Sydney, Australia, but they won&#x27;t actually be acquainted with it until they have been there in person. Gertler uses this disparity to oppose Conee&#x27;s account: a dualist who posits the existence of qualia has a way of explaining it, with reference to qualia as different entities than physical objects; while Conee describes the disparity, Gertler argues that his physicalist account does nothing to explain it.

==== The old fact/new guise analysis ====
The response to the knowledge argument depends on whether we can accurately capture the new type of knowledge Mary gains when she leaves the room. Those who propose the ability analysis and the acquaintance analysis both agree that Mary learns something new, but they differ on whether this new knowledge can be reduced to factual knowledge or whether it requires direct experience. Another analysis, called the old fact/new guise analysis, denies that Mary learns something new at all. Instead, it suggests that Mary gains a new understanding of an old fact in a different way. This analysis depends on the idea that there are many ways to express the same fact. For example, the fact that Bruce Wayne is 6&#x27;2&quot; tall can also be expressed as &quot;Batman is 6&#x27;2&quot; tall&quot; or &quot;Bruce Wayne mesure 1.8796 mètres&quot; in French. Proponents of the old fact/new guise analysis argue that Mary gains a new understanding of an old fact through the acquisition of a phenomenal concept of red. They believe that Mary is now able to express an old fact about the sensation of red in a new way. However, whether this analysis is successful in responding to the knowledge argument depends on how phenomenal concepts are defined in a way that is compatible with physicalism.

=== The neural basis of qualia ===
V.S. Ramachandran and Edward Hubbard of the Center for Brain and Cognition at UCSD argue that Mary might do one of three things upon seeing a red apple for the first time:
# Mary says she sees nothing but gray.
# She has the &quot;Wow!&quot; response from subjectively experiencing the color for the first time.
# She experiences a form of &quot;blindsight&quot; for color, in which she reports seeing no difference between a red apple and an apple painted gray, but when asked to point to the red apple, she correctly does.

They explain further: &quot;Which of these three possible outcomes will actually occur? We believe we&#x27;ve learned the answer from a colorblind synesthete subject. Much like the theoretical Mary, our colorblind synesthete volunteer cannot see certain hues, because of deficient color receptors. However, when he looks at numbers, his synesthesia enables him to experience colors in his mind that he has never seen in the real world. He calls these &quot;Martian colors.&quot; The fact that color cells (and corresponding colors) can activate in his brain helps us answer the philosophical question: we suggest that the same thing will happen to Mary.&quot;

Ramachandran and Hubbard&#x27;s contribution is in terms of exploring &quot;the neural basis of qualia&quot; by &quot;using pre-existing, stable differences in the conscious experiences of people who experience synaesthesia compared with those who do not&quot; but, they note that &quot;this still doesn&#x27;t explain why these particular events are qualia laden and others are not (Chalmers&#x27; &quot;hard problem&quot;) but at least it narrows the scope of the problem&quot; (p. 25).

=== Dualist responses ===
Jackson&#x27;s argument is meant to support mind–body dualism, the view that the mind, or at least some aspects of the mind, are non-physical. Nida-Rümelin contends that, because mind–body dualism is relatively unpopular among contemporary philosophers, and there are also not many examples of dualist responses to the knowledge argument; nevertheless, she points out that there are some prominent examples of dualists responding to the Knowledge Argument worth noting.

Jackson himself went on to reject epiphenomenalism and mind–body dualism altogether. He argues that, because when Mary first sees red, she says &quot;Wow!&quot;, it must be Mary&#x27;s qualia that causes her to say &quot;Wow!&quot;. This contradicts epiphenomenalism because it involves a conscious state causing an overt speech behavior. Since the Mary&#x27;s room thought experiment seems to create this contradiction, there must be something wrong with it. Jackson now believes that the physicalist approach (from a perspective of indirect realism) provides the better explanation. In contrast to epiphenomenalism, Jackson says that the experience of red is entirely contained in the brain, and the experience immediately causes further changes in the brain (e.g. creating memories). This is more consilient with neuroscience&#x27;s understanding of color vision. Jackson suggests that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world. In a similar argument, philosopher Philip Pettit likens the case of Mary to patients with akinetopsia, the inability to perceive the motion of objects. If someone were raised in a stroboscopic room and subsequently &#x27;cured&#x27; of the akinetopsia, they would not be surprised to discover any new facts about the world (they do, in fact, know that objects move). Instead, their surprise would come from their brain now allowing them to &quot;see&quot; this motion.

Despite a lack of dualist responses overall and Jackson&#x27;s own change of view, there are more recent instances of prominent dualists defending the knowledge argument. David Chalmers, one of the most prominent contemporary dualists, considers Jackson&#x27;s thought experiment to successfully show that materialism is false. Chalmers considers responses along the lines of the &quot;ability hypothesis&quot; objection (described above) to be the most promising objections, but unsuccessful: even if Mary does gain a new ability to imagine or recognize colors, she would also necessarily gain factual knowledge about the colors she now sees, such as the fact of how the experience of seeing red relates to the physical brain states underlying it. He also considers arguments that knowledge of what it is like to see red and of the underlying physical mechanisms are actually knowledge of the same fact, just under a different &quot;mode of presentation&quot;, meaning Mary did not truly gain new factual knowledge. Chalmers rejects these, arguing that Mary still necessarily gains new factual knowledge about how the experience and the physical processes relate to one another, i.e. a fact about exactly what kind of experience is caused by those processes. Martine Nida-Rümelin defends a complex, though similar, view, involving properties of experience she calls &quot;phenomenal properties&quot;.

<doc id="539989" wikidata="Q1358378" url="?curid=539989" title="Variations on a Theme by Haydn">
<text>The Variations on a Theme by Joseph Haydn (), now also called the Saint Anthony Variations, is a work in the form of a theme and variations, composed by Johannes Brahms in the summer of 1873 at Tutzing in Bavaria. It consists of a theme in B major based on a &quot;Chorale St Antoni&quot;, eight variations, and a finale. The work was published in two versions: for two pianos, written first but designated Op. 56b; and for orchestra, designated Op. 56a. The orchestral version is better known and much more often heard than the two-piano version. 

The first performance of the orchestral version was given on 2 November 1873 by the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra under Brahms&#x27;s baton.

It is often said to be the first independent set of variations for orchestra in the history of music, although there is at least one earlier piece in the same form, Antonio Salieri&#x27;s &quot;Twenty-six Variations on &#x27;La folia di Spagna&#x27;&quot; written in 1815.

==Origin of the theme==
Brahms composed the work on a theme entitled &quot;Chorale St. Antoni&quot;, which Brahms found in a wind ensemble composition. When Brahms discovered it, the wind ensemble piece carried an attribution to the composer Joseph Haydn. Brahms titled his own composition accordingly, crediting Haydn for the theme. However, music publishers in the early nineteenth century often attached the names of famous composers to works by unknown or lesser-known composers, to make the pieces more saleable. Subsequent research has concluded that the wind piece Brahms used as a source does not fit Haydn&#x27;s style. The wind ensemble piece remains without clear attribution.

As a result, Brahms&#x27;s piece is sometimes referred to today, in recordings and concert programs, as the &quot;St. Anthony Variations&quot; or &quot;Variations on the St. Anthony Chorale&quot;, in addition to the original title that Brahms gave it.

A detailed survey of the controversy can be found in Douglas Yeo&#x27;s 2004 edition of the &quot;Haydn&quot; piece (ISMN M-57015-175-1). In 1870, Brahms&#x27;s friend Carl Ferdinand Pohl, the librarian of the Vienna Philharmonic Society, who was working on a Haydn biography at the time, showed Brahms a transcription he had made of a piece attributed to Haydn titled &quot;Divertimento No. 1&quot;. The second movement bore the heading &quot;St. Anthony Chorale&quot;, and it is this movement which provides the theme on which the variations are based. Brahms&#x27;s statement of the theme varies in small but significant ways from the original, principally with regard to instrumentation. 

Some sources state the Divertimento was probably written by Ignaz Pleyel, but this has not been definitively established. A further question is whether the composer of the divertimento actually wrote the &quot;St. Anthony Chorale&quot; or simply quoted an older theme taken from an unknown source. To date, no other mention of a &quot;St. Anthony Chorale&quot; has been found.

==Instrumentation==
The variations are scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns (2 in E, 2 in B), 2 trumpets, timpani, triangle, and the normal string section of first and second violins, violas, cellos and double basses. 

The piece usually takes about 18 minutes to perform.
==Form==
The theme begins with a repeated ten-measure passage which itself consists of two intriguing five-measure phrases, a quirk that is likely to have caught Brahms&#x27;s attention. Almost without exception, the eight variations follow the phrasal structure of the theme and, though less strictly, the harmonic structure as well. Each has a distinctive character, several calling to mind the forms and techniques of earlier eras, with some displaying a mastery of counterpoint seldom encountered in Romantic music.

The finale is a magnificent theme and variations on a ground bass, five measures in length, derived from the principal theme. Its culmination, a restatement of the chorale, is a moment of such transcendence that the usually austere Brahms permits himself the use of a triangle.

Just before the end of the piece, in the coda of the finale, Brahms quotes a passage that really is by Haydn. In measures 463–464, the violas and cellos echo the cello line from measure 148 of the second movement of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Clock&quot; Symphony, one of the finest examples of Haydn&#x27;s pioneering work in the symphonic variation form. The reader may compare the two passages by following these links: Brahms, Haydn (see below for link credits). This fragmentary allusion may be the music&#x27;s sole link to music known with certainty to be by Haydn.

==Sections==

The sections are named and tempo markings given as follows. Where the tempo markings of the two versions differ, the one for Op. 56b is shown in parentheses.

* Theme. Chorale St. Antoni. &quot;Andante&quot;
* Variation I. &quot;Poco più animato&quot; (&quot;Andante con moto&quot;)
* Variation II. &quot;Più vivace&quot; (&quot;Vivace&quot;)
* Variation III. &quot;Con moto&quot;
* Variation IV. &quot;Andante con moto&quot; (&quot;Andante&quot;)
* Variation V. &quot;Vivace&quot; (&quot;Poco presto&quot;)
* Variation VI. &quot;Vivace&quot;
* Variation VII. &quot;Grazioso&quot;
* Variation VIII. &quot;Presto non troppo&quot; (&quot;Poco presto&quot;)
* Finale. &quot;Andante&quot;

<doc id="539996" wikidata="Q36751" url="?curid=539996" title="Phrygian language">
<text>The Phrygian language () was the Indo-European language of the Phrygians, spoken in Anatolia (in modern Turkey), during classical antiquity (c. 8th century BCE to 5th century CE).

Phrygian ethno-linguistic homogeneity is debatable. Ancient Greek authors used &quot;Phrygian&quot; as an umbrella term to describe a vast ethno-cultural complex located mainly in the central areas of Anatolia rather than a name of a single &quot;tribe&quot; or &quot;people&quot;. Plato observed that some Phrygian words resembled Greek ones.

Because of the fragmentary evidence of Phrygian, its exact position within the Indo-European language family is uncertain. Phrygian shares important features mainly with Greek, but also with Armenian and Albanian. Evidence of a Thraco-Armenian separation from Phrygian and other Paleo-Balkan languages at an early stage, Phrygian&#x27;s classification as a centum language, and the high frequency of phonetic, morphological, and lexical isoglosses shared with Greek, have led to a current consensus which regards Greek as the closest relative of Phrygian.

== Discovery and decipherment ==
Ancient authors like Herodotus and Hesychius have provided us with a few dozen words assumed to be Phrygian, so-called glosses. In modern times the first monument with a Phrygian text, found at Ortaköy (classical Orcistus), was described in 1752. In 1800 at Yazılıkaya (classical Nakoleia) two more inscriptions were discovered. On one of them the word ΜΙΔΑΙ (&quot;Midai&quot;), &#x27;to Midas&#x27;, could be read, which prompted the idea that they were part of a building, possibly the grave, of the legendary Phrygian king Midas. Later, when Western archeologists, historians and other scholars began to travel through Anatolia to become acquainted with the geographical background of Homer&#x27;s world and the New Testament, more monuments were discovered. By 1862 sixteen Phrygian inscriptions were known, among them a few Greek-Phrygian bilinguals. This allowed German scholar Andreas David Mordtmann to undertake the first serious attempt to decipher the script, though he overstressed the parallels of Phrygian to Armenian, which led to some false conclusions. After 1880, the Scottish Bible scholar William Mitchell Ramsay discovered many more inscriptions. In the 20th century, the understanding of Phrygian has increased, due to a steady flow of new texts, more reliable transcriptions, and better knowledge of the Indo-European sound change laws. The alphabet is now well-known, though minor revisions of the rarer signs of the alphabet are still possible, one sign ( = /j/, transcribed &quot;y&quot;) was only securely identified in 1969.

== Classification ==

Phrygian is a member of the Indo-European linguistic family, but because of the fragmentary evidence, its exact position within that family is uncertain. Phrygian is placed among the Palaeo-Balkan languages, either through areal contact or genetic relationship. Phrygian shares important features mainly with Greek, but also with Armenian and Albanian. Also Macedonian and Thracian, ancient languages of the Balkans, are often regarded as being closely related to Phrygian, however they are considered problematic sources for comparison due to their scarce attestation.

Between the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, Phrygian was mostly considered a satem language, and thus closer to Armenian and Thracian, while today it is commonly considered to be a centum language and thus closer to Greek. The reason that in the past Phrygian had the guise of a satem language was due to two secondary processes that affected it. Namely, Phrygian merged the old labiovelar with the plain velar, and secondly, when in contact with palatal vowels /e/ and /i/, especially in initial position, some consonants became palatalized. Furthermore, Kortlandt (1988) presented common sound changes of Thracian and Armenian and their separation from Phrygian and the rest of the palaeo-Balkan languages from an early stage.

Modern consensus views Greek as the closest relative of Phrygian. Furthermore, out of 36 isoglosses collected by Obrador Cursach, Phrygian shared 34 with Greek, with 22 being exclusive between them. The last 50 years of Phrygian scholarship developed a hypothesis that proposes a proto-Graeco-Phrygian stage out of which Greek and Phrygian originated, and if Phrygian was more sufficiently attested, that stage could perhaps be reconstructed.

An alternative theory, suggested by Eric P. Hamp, is that Phrygian was most closely related to Italo-Celtic languages.

==Inscriptions==
The Phrygian epigraphical material is divided into two distinct subcorpora, Old Phrygian and New Phrygian. These attest different stages of the Phrygian language, are written with different alphabets and upon different materials, and have different geographical distributions.

Old Phrygian is attested in 395 inscriptions in Anatolia and beyond. They were written in the Phrygian alphabet between 800 and 330 BCE. The &quot;Corpus des inscriptions paléo-phrygiennes&quot; (CIPPh) and its supplements contain most known Old Phrygian inscriptions, though a few graffiti are not included. The oldest inscriptions—from the mid-8th century BCE—have been found on silver, bronze, and alabaster objects in tumuli (grave mounds) at Gordion (Yassıhüyük, the so-called &quot;Midas Mound&quot;) and Bayındır (East Lycia).

New Phrygian is attested in 117 funerary inscriptions, mostly curses against desecrators added after a Greek epitaph. New Phrygian was written in the Greek alphabet between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE and is restricted to the western part of ancient Phrygia, in central Anatolia. Most New Phrygian inscriptions have been lost, so they are only known through the testimony of the first compilers. New Phrygian inscriptions have been cataloged by William M. Ramsay (ca. 1900) and by Obrador-Cursach (2018).

Some scholars identify a third division, Middle Phrygian, which is represented by a single inscription from Dokimeion. It is a Phrygian epitaph consisting of six hexametric verses written in eight lines, and dated to the end of the 4th century BCE, following the Macedonian conquest. It is considered the first Phrygian text to be inscribed with the Greek alphabet. Its phraseology has some echoes of an Old Phrygian epitaph from Bithynia, but it anticipates phonetic and spelling features found in New Phrygian. Three graffiti from Gordion, from the 4th to the 2nd centuries BCE, are ambiguous in terms of the alphabet used as well as their linguistic stage, and might also be considered Middle Phrygian.

The last mentions of the language date to the 5th century CE, and it was likely extinct by the 7th century CE.

== Alphabet ==

From ca. 800 till 300 BCE, Phrygians used the Old-Phrygian alphabet of nineteen letters derived from the Phoenician alphabet. This script was usually written from left to right (&quot;dextroverse&quot;). The signs of this script are:

About 15 percent of the inscriptions are written from right to left (&quot;sinistroverse&quot;), like Phoenician; in those cases, the signs are drawn mirrored:... etc. instead of BΓ... A few dozen inscriptions are written in alternating directions (boustrophedon).

From ca. 300 BCE, this script was replaced by the Greek alphabet. A single inscription dates from ca. 300 BCE (sometimes called &quot;Middle-Phrygian&quot;), all other texts are much later, from the 1st till 3rd centuries CE (New-Phrygian). The Greek letters Θ, Ξ, Φ, Χ, and Ψ were rarely used—mainly for Greek names and loanwords (Κλευμαχοι, &quot;to Kleomakhos&quot;; θαλαμει, &quot;funerary chamber&quot;).

==Phonology==
It has long been claimed that Phrygian exhibits a sound change of stop consonants, similar to Grimm&#x27;s Law in Germanic and, more to the point, sound laws found in Proto-Armenian; i.e., voicing of PIE aspirates, devoicing of PIE voiced stops and aspiration of voiceless stops. This hypothesis was rejected by Lejeune (1979) and Brixhe (1984) but revived by Lubotsky (2004) and Woodhouse (2006), who argue that there is evidence of a partial shift of obstruent series; i.e., voicing of PIE aspirates (&quot;*bʱ&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot;) and devoicing of PIE voiced stops (&quot;*d&quot; &gt; &quot;t&quot;).

The affricates &quot;ts&quot; and &quot;dz&quot; may have developed from velars before front vowels.

==Grammar==
What can be recovered of the grammatical structure of Phrygian was typically Indo-European. Declensions and conjugations are strikingly similar to ancient Greek.

=== Nouns ===
Phrygian nouns belong to three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Forms are singular or plural; dual forms are not known. Four cases are known: nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative.

==== Substantives ====
Nouns belong to three stem groups: &quot;o&quot;-stems, &quot;a&quot;-stems, and consonant stems (&quot;&quot;C&quot;-stems&quot;); the latter group also includes &quot;i&quot;- and &quot;u&quot;-stems. In addition there is a group of personal names with an e-stem.

The paradigm for nouns is as follows (to keep the paradigm clear, the many minor spelling variants, including New-Phrygian ones in Greek characters, are omitted):


Examples:
* &quot;a&quot;-stem: μανκα [&quot;manka&quot;] (&quot;stele&quot;): Nom. μανκα [&quot;manka&quot;]; Acc. μανκαν [&quot;mankan&quot;]; Dat. μανκαι [&quot;mankai&quot;], μανκα, μανκης, μανκε.

==== Pronouns ====
The most frequently used pronouns are demonstrative, relative, and anaphoric. Their declensions are similar to those of nouns. Two rare pronouns, &quot;autos&quot; and &quot;tis&quot;, may be loanwords from Greek.

The demonstrative pronoun, &quot;this&quot;, has a short (&quot;ses&quot;) and a long form (&quot;semoun&quot;). Its declension:
There is also a clitic particle variant &quot;s-&quot;, prefixed to names: sManes (&quot;this Manes&quot;).

The relative pronoun is &quot;yos&quot; (&quot;who, whoever&quot;). Though appearing often, only three different cases are attested. Paradigm:
A reduplicated form &quot;yosyos&quot;, &quot;whoever&quot;, is also known (cf. Latin &quot;quisquis&quot;).

An anaphoric pronoun is &quot;tos&quot; (&quot;the one mentioned, this one, he&quot;). It is often used in the standard expression ιος νι..., τος νι...: &quot;whoever (damages this tomb), this one (will be damned)&quot;; &quot;whoever (...), he (...)&quot;.
Declension:

&quot;Tos&quot; has a particle variant, τι, του, &quot;-t, -τ&quot;. The particles τι and του, used after a demonstrative pronoun, or suffixed to it as &quot;-t&quot; or -τ, seem to emphasize the following noun: (&quot;whoever does damage&quot;) σεμουν του κνουμανει, &quot;to this very tomb&quot;.

Another anaphoric pronoun is &quot;oy&quot; / &quot;ioi&quot;. It only occurs as a Dative Singular, &quot;oy&quot;, ιοι, οι (&quot;to him, to her&quot;).

The emphatic pronoun &quot;autos&quot; (&quot;the very one, the same&quot;; cf. Greek αὐτός) can also be used anaphorically. Its composite &quot;ve(n)autos&quot; is a reflexive pronoun, &quot;himself&quot; (Greek ἑαυτός).

The indefinite pronoun &quot;kos&quot; (&quot;somebody, something&quot;) is only attested in the nominative singular: masculine kos, κος; neuter kin, κιν. A synonym is the very rare Greek loanword &quot;tis&quot; (τις, neuter τι).

The personal or possessive pronoun &quot;her&quot; (only the feminine is attested) is &quot;va&quot; (Nom. va, ουα; Acc. ουαν, οαν; Gen. vay).

==== Adjectives ====
The declension of adjectival nouns is entirely similar to that of substantives.

Examples (note that &quot;mekas&quot; corresponds to Greek μέγας, &quot;big, great&quot;, and that -τετικμενος and γεγρειμενος parallel Greek Perfect Passive participles with reduplication and ending in &quot;-menos&quot;):
=== Verbs ===
Due to the limited textual material, the conjugation of Phrygian verbs can only be determined very incompletely. However, it is clear that it closely resembles the Ancient Greek verbal system. Three tenses are known: present, aorist (with augment and &quot;-s-&quot; infix), and perfect. Future forms have not yet been discovered. Neither has a pluperfect; a few forms may be an imperfect. There are two voices, active and mediopassive. As to mood, indicative and imperative are clearly documented, but suspected subjunctive forms and an optative (the latter with typical &quot;-oi-&quot; infix) need confirmation. Participles are present, most of them perfect passive forms with reduplication and ending in &quot;-menos&quot;. Infinitives are not known. As to person and number, most finite forms are 3rd person singular, a few 3rd person plural, and only very few 1st person singular.

Examples:
The augment Phrygian seems to exhibit, is like Greek, Indo-Iranian, and Armenian; cf. , probably corresponding to Proto-Indo-European &#x27; (&#x27; with loss of the final &quot;t&quot;, &quot;)&quot;, although comparison to examples like &quot;ios... addaket&quot; &#x27;who does... to&#x27;, which is not a past tense form (perhaps subjunctive), shows that &quot;-et&quot; may be from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) primary ending .

=== Syntax ===
Normal word order in Phrygian sentences is Subject – Object – Verb (&quot;SOV&quot;). However, if a direct object (DO) needs to be emphasized, it may be placed at the head of the sentence, before the subject. Part of an indirect object (IO) may be placed after the verb. Example:

The function of the several nominal cases (nominative, accusative, etc.) presents no surprises. The dative is perhaps also used as a locative. When the subject of a sentence is compounded of more than one item (&quot;A and B and C...&quot;), that vary in gender or number, the verb or predicate agrees in gender and number with the &quot;first&quot; item (&quot;A&quot;) (Lubotsky&#x27;s rection rule). Adjectives follow their noun, except when emphasis is intended.

==Vocabulary==
The Midas inscription over the [[cornice]] of the [[Midas monument]]. It reads &quot;Ates... Midai lavagtaei vanaktei edaes&quot; (&quot;Ates... has dedicated [this monument) to Midas, leader of the people and ruler&quot;).
Phrygian is attested fragmentarily, known only from a comparatively small corpus of inscriptions.
A few hundred Phrygian words are attested; however, the meaning and etymologies of many of these remain unknown.

A famous Phrygian word is &quot;bekos&quot;, meaning &#x27;bread&#x27;. According to Herodotus (&quot;Histories&quot; 2.2), Pharaoh Psammetichus I wanted to determine the oldest nation and establish the world&#x27;s original language. For this purpose, he ordered two children to be reared by a shepherd, forbidding him to let them hear a single word, and charging him to report the children&#x27;s first utterance. After two years, the shepherd reported that on entering their chamber, the children came up to him, extending their hands, calling &quot;bekos&quot;. Upon enquiry, the pharaoh discovered that this was the Phrygian word for &#x27;wheat bread&#x27;, after which the Egyptians conceded that the Phrygian nation was older than theirs. The word &quot;bekos&quot; is also attested several times in Palaeo-Phrygian inscriptions on funerary stelae. It may be cognate to the English &quot;bake&quot; (PIE *&quot;bʰeh₃g-&quot;). Hittite, Luwian (both also influenced Phrygian morphology), Galatian and Greek (which also exhibits a high amount of isoglosses with Phrygian) all influenced Phrygian vocabulary.

According to Clement of Alexandria, the Phrygian word &quot;bedu&quot; () meaning &#x27;water&#x27; (PIE *&quot;wed-&quot;) appeared in Orphic ritual.

The Greek theonym Zeus appears in Phrygian with the stem &quot;Ti-&quot; (genitive &quot;Tios&quot; = Greek &quot;Dios&quot;, from earlier &quot;*Diwos&quot;; the nominative is unattested); perhaps with the general meaning &#x27;god, deity&#x27;. It is possible that &quot;tiveya&quot; means &#x27;goddess&#x27;. The shift of &quot;*d&quot; to &quot;t&quot; in Phrygian and the loss of &quot;*w&quot; before &quot;o&quot; appears to be regular. Stephanus Byzantius records that according to Demosthenes, Zeus was known as &quot;Tios&quot; in Bithynia.

Another possible theonym is &quot;bago-&quot; (cf. Old Persian &quot;baga-&quot;, Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;god&quot;), attested as the accusative singular &quot;bag̣un&quot; in G-136. Lejeune identified the term as &quot;*bʰagom&quot;, in the meaning &#x27;a gift, dedication&#x27; (PIE &quot;*bʰag-&quot; &#x27;to apportion, give a share&#x27;). But Hesychius of Alexandria mentions a &quot;Bagaios, Phrygian Zeus&quot; () and interprets the name as &#x27;giver of good things&#x27;. Mallory and Adams agree that the word &quot;Bagaios&quot; was an epithet to the Phrygian worship of Zeus that derived from the same root.

== Phrygian poetry ==
Phrygian poetry is rare. The only examples date from after Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest of Asia Minor (334 BCE), and they probably originated in imitation of Greek metrical epitaphs. The clearest example is the so-called &quot;Middle Phrygian&quot; inscription mentioned above, which consists of six dactylic hexameter lines. Also, as Lubotsky has proposed, the traditional Phrygian damnation formula on grave monuments may have been slightly reformulated to fit into a two-line hexametric shape (the stress accents, or ictus, on the first syllable of each dactylus are in boldface):
: ιος νι σεμουν κνουμανει κακουν αδδακετ αινι τεαμας
: με ζεμελως κε δεως κε Τιη τιτετικμενος ειτου.
:: ios ni semoun knoumanei kakoun addaket aini teamas
:: me zemelōs ke deōs ke tiē titetikmenos eitou.
::: &quot;Whoever to this tomb harm does, or to the grave,&quot;
::: &quot;among humans and gods by Zeus accursed let him be.&quot;

Alliteration &quot;(&#x27;b-, b-, b-&#x27;)&quot; may be intended in a peculiar clause found on two New-Phrygian grave monuments from Erten (near Yazılıkaya) and Güney: 
: [&quot;If someone damages this grave, then...&quot;]
:... Βας ιοι βεκος με βερετ. (— pronounced, &quot;Bas ioi bekos me beret.&quot;)
::&quot;... may &quot;[&quot;the god&quot;]&quot; Bas not bring him bread.&quot;

(&quot;Bas&quot; is suspected to be a Phrygian fertility god. Note that &quot;bekos&quot; is the word for &#x27;bread&#x27; given by Herodotus, while &quot;me&quot; conforms to Greek μή, &#x27;not&#x27;, and &quot;beret&quot; is cognate with Greek φέρειν, Latin &quot;ferre&quot;, &#x27;to bear&#x27;.)

<text>Precision Air Services Plc (operating as Precision Air; DSE:PAL) is a Tanzanian airline based at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam. The airline operates scheduled passenger services to Nairobi and Comoros; and to various airports and airstrips in Tanzania. Kenya Airways owns 41.23% of the airline.

==History==
Precision Air was incorporated in Tanzania in January 1991 as a private airline and started operations in 1993. At first, it operated as a private charter air transport company but in November 1993 changed to offer scheduled services to serve the growing tourist market.

In 2006, Precision Air became the first Tanzanian airline to pass the IATA Operational Safety Audit.

In April 2011, the airline became a public company.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership===
Precision Air was privately owned until 2003, when Kenya Airways acquired a 49 percent stake, paying US$2 million, weeks after its rival South African Airways acquired a 49 percent stake in Air Tanzania for US$20 million. The remaining 51 percent was retained by Michael Shirima, the founder of the airline.

In October 2011, Precision Air floated shares in its stock in an initial public offering on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, after which Shirima&#x27;s and Kenya Airways&#x27;s stakes declined and the new share subscribers owned 15.86 percent. As of 31 March 2016, the major shareholders were:

===Business trends===
Because it was a private company until 2011, published figures were not generally available before the initial public offering prospectus of 12 September 2011. Since then, full Annual Reports and Accounts have been published. (, however, those for 2019 and 2020 are still awaited.)

Available trends over recent years for the Precision Air group (Precision Air Services Plc and its subsidiaries Precision Handling Limited and Precise Systems Limited) (as at year ending 31 March) are:

Published reports in June 2013 indicated that Precision Air had encountered substantial financial difficulties, stemming in part from losses incurred while operating flights to and from Johannesburg, South Africa. Those flights ended in September 2012. &quot;The Citizen&quot;, a Tanzanian newspaper, reported in August 2013 that the airline &quot;desperately&quot; needed a US$32 million bailout package from the Tanzanian government or other non-shareholder sources. The airline&#x27;s problems increased in 2011 when it received only US$7.4 million of the US$17.5 million in cash that the airline hoped to receive when first listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange. Increasing fuel prices, taxes, and levies plus currency fluctuations and the refusal of minority owner Kenya Airways to contribute capital had also hurt the airline.

==Destinations==

As of 2025, the airline serves the following destinations:

==Partnerships==
===Codeshare agreements===

# Etihad Airways (Abu Dhabi-Dar es Salaam)
# Kenya Airways (various routes)

# RwandAir (Kigali–Kilimanjaro)

===Interline agreements===

In 2011, Precision Air entered into an interline agreement with Qatar Airways, allowing the latter&#x27;s passengers to connect to other east African destinations such as Arusha and Zanzibar via Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro International Airport. This agreement includes e-ticketing.

As of 23 December 2014, Precision Air also had 21 interline agreements for baggage and paper ticketing purposes with the following airlines:

==Accidents and incidents==

According to the Aviation Safety Network Precision Air has had seven accidents or incidents. One of those caused 19 fatalities.

* 26 July 1999: A Let L-410UVP-E9, tail number 5H-PAB, made a belly landing at Arusha Airport on a training flight while doing a touch and go landing. The two crew and three passengers were not injured.
* 16 November 2004: A Let L-410UVP-E20, tail number 5H-PAC, crash landed while on a training flight at Kilimanjaro Airport. The two pilots, who had not put on their shoulder straps, sustained facial injuries.
* 8 July 2007: An ATR 72–212, tail number 5H-PAR, had a runway excursion on landing at Nairobi&#x27;s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport runway 06. It veered to the right, went over a ditch, and came to a stop on Taxiway F. The nose wheel collapsed. The four crew and 62 passengers were not injured. The aircraft was substantially damaged. The probable cause of this accident was power asymmetry during application of reverse thrust on landing. The control levers were jammed in one position.
* On 13 December 2013, an ATR 42–600 (5H–PWI) made a safe landing at Arusha Airport after its four tires deflated upon landing. All 37 passengers and 4 crew were safe. The airline subsequently explained that higher braking forces, necessitated by the aircraft landing with a tailwind, caused the deflations.
* 10 July 2014: An ATR 72–500, tail number 5H-PWA, was halfway to Dar es Salaam from Mwanza during normal cruise when the number 2 engine seized. This necessitated a diversion to Kilimanjaro International Airport. The aircraft touched down normally; however, after selecting ground idle (as per the captain&#x27;s explanation), the aircraft veered to the left and exited the runway hitting one of the runway edge lights and proceeded to roll on the grass field parallel to runway 09 for approximately 180 meters before subsequently regaining the runway. No injuries were reported.
* 9 December 2018 Flight PW 722 with 68 passengers from Nairobi to Mwanza via Kilimanjaro had multiple birdstrikes on approach, including on the wheels that caused difficulties on landing.
* 6 November 2022: Precision Air Flight 494, an ATR 42-500 (5H-PWF) with 39 passengers and 4 crew crashed in Lake Victoria while landing at Bukoba Airport, Tanzania. There were 19 deaths. It was the first fatal accident in the airline&#x27;s history.

<text>Reedley Hallows or Reedley is a civil parish in the Borough of Pendle in Lancashire, England. It forms part of Burnley and Brierfield. It had a population of 1,994, reducing to 1,960 at the 2011 Census.

It is on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and the construction of a marina started in January 2008 and is expected to be completed in September. The local railway station, Reedley Hallows Halt on the East Lancashire Line, closed in 1956. The marina, and the site of the railway station, are both outside the current boundary of the parish, and are in an unparished area, which is part of the town of Burnley.

==History==
The civil parish was created in 1894 from the majority of Reedley Hallows, Filly Close and New Laund Booth civil parish. That civil parish had been created in 1866 from the township in the ancient parish of Whalley.

The original boundary with Burnley was Barden Clough, but as town expanded it was moved to the north-west.

Although administratively inside the parish of Whalley, as parts of the former royal hunting Forest of Pendle, the area was extra-parochial until 1887. As part of the Honour of Clitheroe, this meant the parish church for the area was the chapel at Clitheroe Castle.

Reedley Hallows is the eastern side of Pendle Water, while New Laund Booth is to the north-west and Filly Close to the south-west. All 3 are originally documented as enclosures in the forest. In 1324 Filly Close was leased in connection with Royle, across Pendle Water in Burnley. In 1341, Reedley Hallows was a stock-farm for the vaccaries (mediaeval cattle farms) in the rest of Pendle Forest. By 1459 the New Laund (probably originally a deer park) had also been leased to farm.

From 1894 to 1974, Reedley was the administrative centre of the Burnley Rural District. The council offices where located in what is now the Oaks Hotel on Colne Road. There is also a Magistrates&#x27; court.

==Notable people==
*John and Robert Nutter, Catholic martyrs executed for being priests in 1584 and 1600.
*Christopher Towneley, of the Towneley Hall family, lived at Moor Isles Farm in latter years of his life, until 1674.

<text>The Bobo doll experiment (or experiments) is the collective name for a series of experiments performed by psychologist Albert Bandura to test his social learning theory. Between 1961 and 1963, he studied children&#x27;s behaviour after watching an adult model act aggressively towards a Bobo doll. The most notable variation of the experiment measured the children&#x27;s behavior after seeing the adult model rewarded, punished, or experience no consequence for physically abusing the Bobo doll.

The social learning theory proposes that people learn largely through observation, imitation, and modelling. The Bobo doll experiment provides a template for understanding various aspects of human behavioral development. It demonstrates that people learn not only by being rewarded or punished but they can also learn from watching someone else being rewarded or punished. These studies have practical implications, such as providing evidence of how children can be influenced by watching violent media.

== Experiment of 1961 ==

=== Method===
The participants in these experiments consisted of 72 children from the Stanford University nursery school between the ages of 37 months and 69 months. For the experiments, a third of the children were exposed to an aggressive model. Another third were exposed to a non-aggressive model. The rest of the participants formed the control group.

For the experiment, each child was exposed to the scenario individually to avoid being influenced or distracted by classmates. The first part of the experiment involved bringing a child and an adult model into a playroom. In the playroom, the child was seated in one corner filled with appealing activities such as stickers and stamps. The adult model was sitting in another corner with a toy set, a mallet, and an inflatable Bobo doll. Before leaving the room, the experimenter explained to the child that the toys in the adult corner were only for the adult to play with.

During the aggressive model scenario, the adult would begin to play with the Bobo doll and then start to show aggressive behaviour towards the doll. Examples of this aggressive behaviour include hitting or punching the Bobo doll and using the toy mallet to hit the Bobo doll in the face. The aggressive model would also verbally assault the Bobo doll yelling, &quot;Sock him,&quot; &quot;Hit him down,&quot; &quot;Kick him,&quot; &quot;Throw him in the air,&quot; or &quot;Pow.&quot; After about 10 minutes, the experimenter returned to the room, dismissed the adult model, and took the child into another playroom. The non-aggressive adult model simply played with other toys for the entire 10-minute period. In this situation, the model ignored the Bobo doll entirely; the child was taken out of the room.

The following experiment stage was performed with the child and experimenter in another room filled with interesting toys such as trucks, dolls, and a spinning top. The child was invited to play with them. After 2 minutes of playtime, the child was told they were no longer allowed to play with the toys because they were reserved for other children. This was done to build frustration. They were told they could instead play with the toys in the experimental room (the aggressive and non-aggressive toys). The child was allowed to play for 20 minutes in the experimental room while an experimenter evaluated the child&#x27;s play.

The first measure recorded was based on physical aggression such as punching, kicking, sitting on the Bobo doll, hitting it with a mallet, and tossing it around the room. The second measure recorded was verbal aggression. The judges counted each time the children imitated the aggressive adult model and recorded their results. The third measure was the number of times the mallet was used to display other forms of aggression than hitting the doll. The final measure included modes of aggression shown by the child that were not directly imitating the role model&#x27;s behaviour.

=== Results ===
Bandura found that the children exposed to the aggressive model were more likely to pursue physically aggressive behaviour than those who were not exposed to the aggressive model. The results concerning gender differences strongly satisfied Bandura&#x27;s prediction that same-sex models have more influence over children. Results also showed that boys exhibited more aggression when exposed to aggressive male models than aggressive female models. While the results for the girls show similar findings, they were less drastic.

Bandura also found that the children exposed to the aggressive model were more likely to act in verbally aggressive ways than those who were not exposed to the aggressive model. The number of imitative verbal aggressions exhibited by the boys was much more than by the girls. Additionally, the results indicated that the boys and girls who observed the non-aggressive model exhibited much less non-imitative aggression than those in the control group, which did not have a model. Lastly, the evidence demonstrates that males tend to be more aggressive than females. When all instances of aggression were tallied, males exhibited 270 aggressive instances compared to 128 aggressive instances exhibited by females.

== Experiment of 1963: live vs. filmed models ==

=== Introduction ===
For his 1963 study, Albert Bandura wanted to vary his original 1961 study by seeing if there were any differences in imitated aggressive behaviour after witnessing a filmed or cartoon model compared to a live model. He also wished to see if children watching aggressive behaviour from a filmed or cartoon model would experience a cathartic effect, or in other words, if they would experience a release of aggressive emotions from seeing a model carrying out aggressive behaviours.

=== Method ===
For the experiment, 96 children, 48 girls, and 48 boys, from the Stanford University nursery were divided into three groups. The first group watched a live model become aggressive towards a Bobo doll. The second group watched a movie version of the human model becoming aggressive toward a Bobo doll, and the third group watched a cartoon version of a cat becoming aggressive towards a Bobo doll. Each child watched the aggressive acts individually to control for group biases. Data from the original 1961 study was used for the control group where children did not view a model. After being exposed to their respective models, all three groups of children were then placed individually in a room with an experimenter. They were exposed to a mildly frustrating situation to elicit aggression. Next, the children were allowed to play freely in an adjoining room full of toys, including the Bobo doll and the &quot;weapons&quot; that the models used. The researchers observed the children and noted any interaction with the Bobo doll.

=== Results ===
The study results show that compared to the control group, all three groups showed similar increases in aggressive behaviour. From this, Bandura concluded that children would imitate aggressive behaviour they witness from a model regardless of who or how it is presented. He also found that watching aggressive behaviour does not cause a cathartic effect. The results of this study are of particular significance because of their contributions to the controversial topic of whether or not violent media can influence children to become more aggressive.

== Experiment of 1965: reinforcement and punishment ==

=== Introduction ===
For his 1965 study, Albert Bandura wanted to see if children&#x27;s learned behaviour would be influenced by vicarious reinforcement, or the act of imitating a behaviour observed in another person after witnessing that person be reinforced for said behaviour.

=== Method ===
In the experiment, 66 children, 33 boys and 33 girls were divided into one of three groups. The first group would witness a model display aggressive behaviours toward a Bobo doll, followed by a researcher praising the model for his behaviour and rewarding him with candy. The second group would witness the same scripted scenario of aggressive behaviours, but the model was instead reprimanded for his actions and hit with a rolled wooden golf club. The third group served as the control group, and the model was neither rewarded nor punished after his displayed behaviour. The children would watch individually to control for group biases. Afterwards, each child would be placed individually in a room structured similarly to the one they saw for 10 minutes. Experimenters would score children based on the number and variation of aggressive behaviours they acted in. The experiment would be repeated a second time, and this time the children would be incentivized with various rewards including candy, juice, and stickers to mimic the behaviour they just witnessed.

=== Results ===
The study showed little difference between the reward and control groups; however, the punishment group displayed much less aggressive behavior, especially girls. In all three groups, personal incentives substantially increased aggressive behavior for both boys and girls. An analysis of the study shows that reinforcement and punishment do not influence learned aggressive behavior, only the outward expression of it.

==Social learning theory==

The findings of these experiments support the principles of social learning theory proposed by Bandura. His research found that behavior is influenced by observing the behavior of others and imitating it. Central to this theory is the idea that the inclination to imitate behavior increases with the presence of an admirable model. Models are a crucial component to the learning of new behaviors and achieving change across different institutions, they drive individuals to shape their own behavior after the actions of models. Unlike behaviorism, in which learning is directly influenced by reinforcement and punishment, social learning theory suggests that watching others be rewarded and punished can indirectly influence behavior. This is known as vicarious reinforcement. If a model receives validation for exhibiting certain behaviors, someone who looks up to the model will be likelier to imitate those behaviors to receive the same validation. The role of vicarious reinforcement is shown through the Bobo Doll Experiment, which demonstrates how the behavior of adults easily influences children. During the experiment, adults received praise for their aggressive behavior, and as a result, the likelihood of the children striking the doll increased. However, when adults were punished for behaving aggressively towards the doll, the children stopped hitting the doll. The Bobo Doll experiment enhanced people&#x27;s understanding of the factors and issues that contribute to aggression.

== Criticism of the experiments ==
*Laboratory studies of imitation often have low ecological validity, meaning key contextual features are absent; in a Bobo doll experiment, the child and the model do not have a prior relationship and do not interact with each other, even in the in-person environment. However, studies have found its approach to be well applied to aggression in institutions and the workplace, which implies that the larger study may have external validity and illustrates its relevance to real-world aggression.
* When the Bobo doll experiment was repeated in 1990, findings showed that children who had not previously been exposed to a Bobo doll were up to five times more likely to imitate aggressive behavior compared to children who had been. Researchers proposed that the sheer novelty of the Bobo doll alone could be a potential third variable that increases the probability that a child imitates the adult.
* The experiment was based upon the principles of social learning theory, which focuses on environmental influences and eliminates the possibility of any biological or evolutionary drives that may underpin aggressive behavior. Biological theorists argue that social learning theory ignores a person&#x27;s biological state, particularly the uniqueness of an individual&#x27;s DNA, brain development, and learning differences.
* Some psychologists claim the study would not be in line with modern ethics standards, including those held by the APA and Stanford. Arguments generally fall into four categories:
** Informed consent: children could not give valid consent to participate in the study. It is assumed that their parents consented for them.
** Long-term wellbeing of participants: participants may model aggressive behavior and learn to act in ways that might be detrimental to their long-term wellbeing.
** Right to withdraw: there was no opportunity for the children to withdraw from the study.
** Right to a debriefing: at no point were the participants provided with a debriefing in which the experimenter explained the study, or in particular, the reason for the aggression displayed by the adults.
* described the frontal lobe of children under eight as underdeveloped, which contributes to an inability to separate reality from fantasy.
*An analysis of the 1961 study noted that children&#x27;s imitations of aggressive behavior occur almost immediately after observing the model. Due to such a short period between observation and imitation, conclusions cannot be made regarding the long-term effects of exposure to violence.

<doc id="540026" wikidata="Q1542829" url="?curid=540026" title="Battle of South Mountain">
<text>The Battle of South Mountain, known in several early Southern accounts as the Battle of Boonsboro Gap, was fought on September 14, 1862, as part of the Maryland campaign of the American Civil War. Three pitched battles were fought for possession of three South Mountain passes: Crampton&#x27;s, Turner&#x27;s, and Fox&#x27;s Gaps. 

Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, commanding the Union Army of the Potomac, needed to pass through these gaps in his pursuit of Confederate General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s precariously divided Army of Northern Virginia. 

Although the delay bought at South Mountain would allow him to reunite his army and forestall defeat in detail, Lee considered termination of the Maryland Campaign at nightfall.

==Background==
South Mountain is the name given to the continuation of the Blue Ridge Mountains after they enter Maryland. It is a natural obstacle that separates the Hagerstown Valley and Cumberland Valley from the eastern part of Maryland.

After Lee invaded Maryland, a copy of an order, known as Special Order 191, detailing troop movements that he wrote fell into the hands of McClellan. From this, McClellan learned that Lee had split his forces, sending one wing under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Jackson to lay siege to Harper&#x27;s Ferry. The rest of Lee&#x27;s army was posted at Boonsboro under command of Maj. Gen. James Longstreet. Lee hoped that after taking Harper&#x27;s Ferry to secure his rear, he could carry out an invasion of the Union, wrecking the Monocacy aqueduct, before turning his attention to Baltimore, Philadelphia, or Washington, D.C..

To counter the Confederate invasion, McClellan led the Army of the Potomac west in an effort to force battle on the isolated parts of Lee&#x27;s divided force.

McClellan temporarily organized his army into three wings for the attacks on the passes. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, the Right Wing, commanded the I Corps (Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker) and IX Corps (Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno). The Right Wing was sent to Turner&#x27;s Gap and Fox&#x27;s Gap in the north. The Left Wing, commanded by Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin, consisting of his own VI Corps and Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch&#x27;s division of the IV Corps, was sent to Crampton&#x27;s Gap in the south. The Center Wing (II Corps and XII Corps), under Maj. Gen. Edwin Vose Sumner, was in reserve.

From Boonsboro, Lee had sent a column under Maj Gen. James Longstreet northward to respond to a perceived threat from Pennsylvania. After learning of McClellan&#x27;s intelligence coup, Lee quickly recalled Longstreet&#x27;s forces to reinforce the South Mountain passes and thus attempt to block McClellan&#x27;s advance. On the day of the battle, the only Confederate force posted around Boonsboro was a five-brigade division under Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill.

==Battles==
===Crampton&#x27;s Gap===
At the southernmost point of the battle, near Burkittsville, Confederate cavalry and a small portion of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws&#x27;s division defended Brownsville Pass and Crampton&#x27;s Gap. McLaws was unaware of the approach of 12,000 Federals and had only 500 men under Col. William A. Parham thinly deployed behind a three quarter-mile-long stone wall at the eastern base of Crampton&#x27;s Gap. Franklin spent three hours deploying his forces. A Confederate later wrote of a &quot;lion making exceedingly careful preparations to spring on a plucky little mouse.&quot; 

Franklin deployed the division of Maj. Gen. Henry Warner Slocum on the right and Maj. Gen. William F. &quot;Baldy&quot; Smith on the left. They seized the gap and captured 400 prisoners, mostly men who were arriving as late reinforcements from Brig. Gen. Howell Cobb&#x27;s brigade.

===Turner&#x27;s Gap===

Confederate Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill, deploying 5,000 men over more than 2 miles, defended both Turner&#x27;s Gap and Fox&#x27;s Gap. Burnside sent Hooker&#x27;s I Corps to the right and Turner&#x27;s Gap. The Union Iron Brigade attacked Colonel Alfred H. Colquitt&#x27;s brigade along the National Road, driving it back up the mountain, but it refused to yield the pass. Hooker positioned three divisions opposite two peaks located one mile north of the gap. The Alabama Brigade of Brig. Gen. Robert E. Rodes was forced to withdraw because of his isolated position, despite the arrival of reinforcements from Brig. Gen. David R. Jones&#x27;s division and Brig. Gen. Nathan G. Evans&#x27;s brigade. 

Darkness and the difficult terrain prevented the complete collapse of Lee&#x27;s line. At nightfall, the Federals held the high ground while the Confederates still held the gap.

In the 1890s, the United States War Department placed six markers at the summit of Turner’s Pass, also known as Turner’s Gap, across from the Old South Mountain Inn. They are on the north side of Alternate U.S. 40, the old National Pike, the main highway west from the Chesapeake Bay to the Ohio Valley during the Civil War. They provide specific details of the events during the battle.

===Fox&#x27;s Gap===
Just to the south, other elements of Hill&#x27;s division (most notably Drayton&#x27;s Brigade ) defended Fox&#x27;s Gap against Reno&#x27;s IX Corps. A 9 a.m. attack by Union Brig. Gen. Jacob D. Cox&#x27;s Kanawha Division secured much of the land south of the gap. In the movement, Lt. Col. Rutherford B. Hayes of the 23rd Ohio led a flank attack and was seriously wounded. Cox pushed through the North Carolinians positioned behind a stone wall at the gap&#x27;s crest, but he failed to capitalize on his gains as his men were exhausted, allowing Confederate reinforcements to deploy in the gap around the Daniel Wise farm. Reno sent forward the rest of his corps, but due to the timely arrival of Southern reinforcements under Confederate Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood, they failed to dislodge the defenders. 

Gen. Jesse Reno and Confederate Brig. Gen. Samuel Garland, Jr., were killed at Fox&#x27;s Gap. After Farmer Wise was paid one dollar each to bury the Confederate soldiers who died behind the stone walls on or near his property, sixty (or more) bodies were dumped down his dry well.

==Aftermath==
By dusk, with Crampton&#x27;s Gap lost and his position at Fox&#x27;s and Turner&#x27;s Gaps precarious, Lee ordered his outnumbered forces to withdraw from South Mountain. McClellan was now in position to destroy Lee&#x27;s army before it could concentrate. Union casualties of 28,000 engaged were 2,325 (443 killed, 1,807 wounded, and 75 missing); Confederates lost 2,685 (325 killed, 1560 wounded, and 800 missing) of 18,000. The Battle of South Mountain was an important morale booster for the defeat-stricken Army of the Potomac. The &quot;New York World&quot; wrote that the battle &quot;turn[ed] back the tide of rebel successes&quot; and &quot;the strength of the rebels is hopelessly broken.&quot; Lee contemplated the end of his Maryland campaign. However, McClellan&#x27;s limited activity on September 15 after his victory at South Mountain condemned the garrison at Harpers Ferry to capture and gave Lee time to unite his scattered divisions at Sharpsburg for the Battle of Antietam on September 17.

==Battlefield preservation==

The American Battlefield Trust and its battlefield land preservation partners have acquired and preserved 703 acres of the South Mountain Battlefield through mid-2023. This includes 188 acres of land at the center of where the fighting took place in 1862. Most of the preserved area sits west of Route 40 south of where the old Sharpsburg Road (now known as Reno Monument Road) meets Fox’s Gap Road.
The battlefield&#x27;s various sites, which Maryland recognizes as South Mountain State Battlefield Park, are preserved within the South Mountain State Park, Gathland State Park, and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Crampton&#x27;s Gap Historic District and Turner&#x27;s and Fox&#x27;s Gaps Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 

18 acres were originally acquired by the Trust in 1991, to which 8 acres were added in 1995. More gains followed, as 136 acres were preserved in 2000, followed by 26 in 2004. Many of these additions were made with the assistance of the Maryland Environmental Trust.

In January 2011, the South Mountain battlefield gained National Heritage Landmark status and in August 2012, the State of Maryland declared its continued commitment to the preservation of these invaluable lands. The Civil War Trust followed these developments with a campaign to save 14 additional acres at the site. The Civil War Trust followed up with another successful preservation victory in 2013 by saving 298 acres of battlefield land at Turner&#x27;s Gap.

However, nearby heritage areas in Frederick and Washington counties are still threatened by development and South Mountain was listed as one of the Most Endangered Battlefields in the 2009 and 2010 editions of History Under Siege. Plans to further develop the site of a natural gas plant just south of Fox’s Gap remain a significant threat to portions of the South Mountain battlefield.

A significant portion of the battlefield near the west side of the Moser Road and Reno Monument Road intersection has not been preserved.
For a description and analysis of the earliest land tracts and roads in the battlefield area, see &quot;The Land Tracts of the Battlefield of South Mountain&quot;.

==Future presidents==
Two future presidents, Rutherford B. Hayes and William McKinley, fought at Fox&#x27;s Gap during the Battle of South Mountain, as part of the 23rd Ohio Infantry—Hayes as its commander, and McKinley a commissary sergeant. Hayes would end the war as a brevet major general and McKinley a brevet major, and they would be elected to the presidency twenty years apart—Hayes in 1876, and McKinley in 1896.

<text>Mary Ford (born Iris Colleen Summers; July 7, 1924 – September 30, 1977) was an American guitarist and vocalist, comprising half of the husband-and-wife musical team Les Paul and Mary Ford. Between 1950 and 1954, the couple had 16 top-ten hits, including &quot;How High the Moon&quot; and &quot;Vaya con Dios&quot;, which were number one hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. In 1951 alone they sold six million records. With Paul, Ford became one of the early practitioners of multi-tracking.

==Early life==
Born Iris Colleen Summers, Mary Ford was born in El Monte, California, the second daughter of Marshall McKinley Summers (born February 13, 1896, in Ridgway, Illinois; died August 5, 1981, in Los Angeles), a Nazarene minister, who later became a painting contractor, and his wife, Dorothy May White Summers. Mary Ford was the sister of Byron Fletcher Summers, Esther E. Williams, Carol Jean Corona, Bruce Summers, Eva Wootten, and Bob Summers. Ford came from a musical family. Her parents left Missouri, travelling cross-country while singing gospel music and preaching at revival meetings across the United States. They eventually settled in southern California, where they were heard over KPPC-AM, Pasadena&#x27;s first Christian radio station. Her sisters and brothers were all musicians. 

While still a junior high school student, Colleen Summers and Mildred L. &quot;Milly&quot; Watson (later Millie Pace) (born February 26, 1922, in Los Angeles; died August 2, 1976, in Orange County, California), a local girl, performed together in churches in Pasadena, California, and later made gospel recordings with Milly&#x27;s older brother, Marvin, for whom she wrote some songs. In 1939 Summers and Milly won a Pasadena talent contest judged by &quot;several Hollywood notables, including a very young Judy Garland&quot;. Hoping to have a musical career, Summers and Milly Watson lost interest in school, played truant frequently and eventually quit school, only to find employment as an usher in a movie theatre.

==Early career==
By 1943, Colleen Summers, with Vivian Earles and June Widener, the sister of western swing guitarist-vocalist Jimmie Widener, formed the Sunshine Girls, a western trio who sang backup to Jimmy Wakely and his trio. They were regulars on &quot;The Hollywood Barn Dance&quot;, a successful weekly CBS Radio program broadcast on Saturday nights, and hosted by Foy Willing and emceed by Cliffie Stone.

In 1944, the Sunshine Girls trio appeared with Wakely in the PRC film &quot;I&#x27;m from Arkansas&quot;, in which they sang &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Whistlin&#x27; (Walkin&#x27;) Down the Lane With You&quot; with Wakely.

In 1945, when Eddie Dean introduced her to guitarist Les Paul, she was a popular western vocalist on KXLA&#x27;s &quot;Dinner Bell Round-Up Time&quot;. The two began performing together in 1946. After Summers left the Sunshine Girls to work with Paul and his trio, she was replaced initially by Marilyn Myers Tuttle. After Tuttle left, Summers&#x27; older sister, Eva, sang with Earles and Widener as the Three Rays on the &quot;Jimmy Wakely Show&quot; on CBS.

Colleen Summers appeared on Gene Autry&#x27;s Melody Ranch CBS radio program as a cast member and featured vocalist from July through early November 1946.

In 1946–48, Summers was a regular actor in the drama portion of &quot;The All-Star Western Theatre&quot;, a radio program hosted by Foy Willing and his Riders of the Purple Sage.

By 1947, Summers became romantically involved with Les Paul, whose first marriage to Virginia M. Webb was failing, as it could no longer endure the stresses and strains of his show-business career. In January 1948, while traveling on Route 66 through Oklahoma, the couple&#x27;s car driven by Summers skidded off the road and plummeted 20 feet into a frozen creek bed. After the accident, Summers identified herself to authorities as Iris Watson. Among Paul&#x27;s many injuries, his right elbow was shattered, and it would be eighteen months before he could play guitar again. After Paul&#x27;s wife Virginia took their two sons to Chicago, Summers moved in with Paul in his house on Curson Avenue, where she took care of him as he recuperated from the effects of the car accident.

By the summer of 1949, Summers was performing under the stage name of Mary Ford. To avoid confusing her established western music audience, initially Paul named his musical partner &quot;Mary Lou&quot;, but later selected the stage name &quot;Mary Ford&quot; from a telephone directory so her name would be almost as short as his.

That same year, Les Paul divorced his wife and wed Mary Ford on December 29 in a &quot;small private ceremony without much fanfare&quot; in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The couple had three children: a baby born on November 26, 1954, who died four days later; Mary Colleen Paul, whom they fostered from 1958; and Robert Ralph &quot;Bobby&quot; Paul (born in 1959).

==Career with Les Paul==
Shortly after their wedding, Paul and Ford began making radio programs together for NBC, including &quot;Les Paul and Mary Ford at Home&quot;, a fifteen-minute program that was pre-recorded and broadcast every Friday night.

Ford and Paul were music superstars during the first half of the 1950s, putting out 28 hits for Capitol Records between 1950 and 1957, including &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;, &quot;Vaya con Dios&quot; (11 weeks at No. 1), &quot;Mockin&#x27; Bird Hill&quot; (top 10), &quot;How High the Moon&quot; (nine weeks at No. 1), &quot;Bye Bye Blues,&quot; and &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise&quot;. These songs featured Ford harmonizing with herself, giving the vocals a novel sound. Paul and Ford did all their recording at home or on the road and submitted the masters to Capitol, with Paul dictating to the record company what songs were destined to become hits. Paul and Ford also used the now-ubiquitous recording technique known as close miking, where the microphone is less than six inches from the singer&#x27;s mouth. This produces a more intimate, less reverberant sound than when the singer is a foot or more from the microphone (see proximity effect). It also emphasizes low-frequency sounds in the voice. The result was a singing style that diverged strongly from earlier styles, such as vocals in musical comedies of the 1930s and 1940s.

After extensive touring and recording, the couple decided to leave Hollywood and moved to New York City to make the crossover from radio to television. They took a cramped apartment in Paul&#x27;s former New York neighborhood, where they conceived and recorded their arrangement of &quot;How High The Moon&quot;, a hard-swinging multi-layered arrangement containing twelve overdubs using the guitar and Ford&#x27;s voice. While Capitol was reluctant to release this song, after they had scored several more hits with Capitol, including, &#x27;Tennessee Waltz&quot; and &quot;Mockin&#x27; Bird Hill&quot;, &quot;How High The Moon&quot; was released in March 1951. Within a month, &quot;How High The Moon&quot; and &quot;Mockin&#x27; Bird Hill&quot; captured &quot;Your Hit Parade&quot;&#x27;s number one and number two spots, respectively.

During 1951, Ford and Paul earned $500,000, and had recorded more top ten hits for the year than Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and The Andrews Sisters combined. They also tied Patti Page for top selling recording artist, having sold more than six million records since January 1951.

Paul bought a Cadillac to use on their expanding road tours with plenty of space for all their electronic gear. They also purchased a woodland retreat in Mahwah, New Jersey, in the Ramapo Mountains, and their mansion included a recording studio and an echo chamber carved out of a neighboring mountain. In September 1952, after cutting &quot;I&#x27;m Sitting on Top of the World&quot;, Ford and Paul sailed for London to appear at the Palladium Theatre, where they debuted before Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family. In 1952, their innovative sound was satirized by Stan Freberg in his recording of &quot;The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise&quot; (Capitol, F 2279).

In 1953, the couple recorded &quot;Vaya con Dios&quot; (Capitol 2486), the biggest-selling song of their career. It was released in June 1953, entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts on June 13, 1953, reached number one on August 8, and remained there for a total of nine weeks. The song lasted thirty-one weeks on the chart, and also reached number one on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; chart.

Following the success of &quot;Vaya con Dios&quot;, in 1953 the couple hosted &quot;The Les Paul and Mary Ford Show&quot;, their own daily television program broadcast from their Mahwah home. The show, which was five minutes long and sponsored by Listerine, ran from 1953 to 1960 on NBC television and in syndication. In early 1955, the rise in popularity of rock and roll music eventually threatened the popularity of many performers, including Paul and Ford. In 1955, they gave a concert at Carnegie Hall, and in 1956, the couple performed at the Eisenhower White House.

With the growth of rock and roll, Ford and Paul faded from the charts in the late 1950s.

In 1956, Ford separated briefly from Paul when she ran away to Amarillo, Texas.

In July 1958, Paul and Ford left Capitol and signed with the Columbia label, but the move failed to restore their declining career, and Ford began increasingly suffering from alcoholism. In 1961, they appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot;.

Les and Mary divorced in December 1964.

==Later years==
In November 1963, Ford released her first solo single, an English-language version of &quot;Dominique&quot;, for Calendar Records.

In about 1965, Ford married Donald Hatfield, whom she had known since high school, and they settled in Monrovia, California. Foy Willing and his wife attended the wedding reception.

Ford and her sisters were used as vocalists on Foy Willing&#x27;s album &quot;The New Sound of American Folk&quot;, which was recorded at their brother Bobby Summers&#x27; Sound House Recorders in El Monte, California, and released on the Jubilee label.

Bassist Red Wootten, who married Mary&#x27;s sister Eva Summers, wrote his memories of playing at the Crescendo in Los Angeles with Mary, her sister Carol and her brother, Bob Summers:
:My brother, Buddy Wootten, also a bassist, called me from Atlanta to tell me he had just finished working the Fox Theater with Les Paul and Mary Ford. Mary also told me this later. This was while I was holding forth with Woody Herman Orchestra. So, later when I had married her sister (Eva), we worked with her other sister and Bob Summers (her brother) on guitar (sounds like Les Paul too) and Mary&#x27;s other sister Carol. The gig was the Crescendo club right in the middle of Sunset Strip. A very hip joint!

:Mary used a drummer added to Bob, Mary and myself on electric bass. We did almost all the Les Paul-Mary Ford recordings but with more heavy end on the bass. Les having used guitar on his bass tracks with Mary earlier. On all their recordings (as good as they were), I always missed that deep dark sound ... Mary (bless her heart) recorded a few of my compositions (never released), but she did an excellent job as always. Mary divorced Les Paul and later married her old school friend from Monrovia, California, namely Don Hatfield, who owned a large construction company in California. He is still with us, and I see him occasionally. Doing great, but he misses Mary.

:Bob Summers, my brother-in-law, has come into his own over the years too. Bob and I worked a lot on MGM records with the Mike Curb scene, early 1960s. He also was chief arranger for the Mike Curb Congregation, and they recorded some of my material, great too! Also Bob and I worked at Capitol Records for Ken Nelson and Cliffie Stone, passed recently. Too many country artists to even name nearly all of them: Hank Thompson, Wynn Stewart, Rose Maddox and others. Roy Lanham did one of his better albums at the Sound House, Merced, in El Monte (my old stamping grounds) and Mary Ford&#x27;s home place, 9840 Kale Street. Bruce Summers (who is no longer with us), a piano man whom I played with a few times; a real swinger too.

In Downey, California, Mary&#x27;s sister Esther Williams played the organ in The Village Restaurant. Esther&#x27;s daughter, Esther Colleen &quot;Suzee&quot; Williams, recalled one amusing incident at the restaurant in the years after Mary Ford and Les Paul had split up:
:There was one singer that came in to sing with my mom. His name was Lou Monica. Well, Mary asked him to learn the song &quot;Donkey Serenade.&quot; It&#x27;s not an easy song to sing. However, Mr. Monica agreed, and after a couple of weeks he said he was ready. As he began to sing, the doors of the club opened wide, and in came Mary, dressed in black with a black gaucho hat, on top of a donkey! Mr. Monica never skipped a beat.

==Awards and honors==
Ford and Paul were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Recording at 1541 Vine Street in Hollywood. In 1978, they were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Death==
Ford succumbed to complications of alcohol abuse in 1977. After eight weeks in a diabetic coma, she died in Arcadia, California, at the age of 53. She is buried at Forest Lawn-Covina Hills in Covina, California. Although her year of birth has been variously reported as either 1924, 1925, or 1928, the year 1924 is engraved on her tombstone, along with &quot;Vaya con Dios&quot; (&quot;Go with God&quot;), the name of one of her most popular songs.

==Documentary film==
Interviews and performance footage of the couple are featured in the musical documentary &quot;Chasing Sound: Les Paul at 90&quot;, directed by John Paulson (&quot;Johnny Mathis Live&quot;, &quot;An Evening with Chita Rivera&quot;). Distributed by Koch Entertainment, the film premiered May 9, 2007 at the Downer Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, followed by its television premiere, July 11, 2007, on PBS as part of its &quot;American Masters&quot; series.

<text>The Audi A6 is an executive car manufactured by the German company Audi since 1994. Now in its fifth generation, the successor to the Audi 100 is manufactured in Neckarsulm, Germany, and is available in saloon and estate configurations, the latter marketed by Audi as the Avant. Audi&#x27;s internal numbering treats the A6 as a continuation of the Audi 100 lineage, with the initial A6 designated as a member of the C4-series, followed by the C5, C6, C7, and the C8. The related Audi A7 is essentially a Sportback (liftback) version of the C7-series and C8-series A6 but is marketed under its own separate identity and model designation.

All generations of the A6 have offered either front-wheel-drive or Torsen-based four-wheel-drive, marketed by Audi as their &quot;quattro&quot; system. The A6 has also been used as the basis for the company&#x27;s Allroad models since 1999.
&#x27;
== C4 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4A, 1994–1997) ==

Audi&#x27;s executive car was previously named the Audi 100 (or Audi 5000 in the United States), and was released in three successive generations (Audi C1, Audi C2 and Audi C3). In 1994, the latest generation (C4) of the Audi 100 received a facelift and was renamed as the Audi A6, to fit in with Audi&#x27;s new alphanumeric nomenclature (as the full-size A8 had just been introduced). The exterior was changed only slightly from the &quot;C4&quot; Audi 100 – new front and rear lights, new radiator grille, similarly with chassis and engine and transmission choices. The United Kingdom was the first market to receive the A6, as stock of RHD Audi 100s had run out before expected, and before the rest of mainland Europe.

The new engines for the A6 were 1.8-litre 20v inline four-cylinder, 2.0-litre 8v inline-four, 2.6-litre 12V V6 and 2.8-litre 30v V6 petrol engines, with the 2.3-litre inline-five engine being dropped on most markets. For the diesel engines, an inline-four 1.9 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI), and the inline-five (R5) 2.5 TDI with were available.

Most of the engine options were also available with Audi&#x27;s Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel-drive system. The A6 was available with saloon and Avant bodies.

=== C4 engines ===
The C4 design was available with the following engines:


=== S6 ===

Upon introducing the C4 series A6, Audi made small revisions to what was previously known as the Audi S4, renaming it the Audi S6; the S4 name would eventually be re-used for a completely different model derived from Audi&#x27;s smaller Volkswagen Group B platform-based Audi A4. As this was the first S6 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the &quot;Ur-S6&quot;, derived from the German augmentative, &quot;Ursprünglich&quot; (meaning: original). It was available as both a saloon/sedan (&quot;type&quot; 4A5), and an &quot;Avant&quot; (&quot;type&quot; 4A9) (estate/wagon) to European and United States customers, but only as a saloon in Canada, Asia and Australia.

From its launch in late 1994, the Audi S6 was powered by a turbocharged inline five-cylinder petrol engine (parts code prefix: 034, identification code: AAN) with a Bosch Motronic electronic engine control unit (ECU), producing a motive power output of at 5,900 rpm and at around 1,950 rpm, on high octane &quot;Super Plus&quot; 98RON unleaded petrol. This engine gave the S6 a top speed of , and allowed it to accelerate from 0 to in 6.7 seconds; with being reached in 17.5 seconds. The vehicle was available with a standard six-speed manual transmission (five-speed only in North America), and Audi&#x27;s dynamic Torsen T-1 Quattro permanent four-wheel-drive system.

Audi made a high-performance, 4.2-litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AEC) with a Bosch KE-Motronic ECU available as an option in the original European S4s, and made the decision to continue to do so with the S6, making a version of the 4.2 available as an optional upgrade over the 2.2-litre inline five-cylinder turbo. Unlike the five-cylinder turbocharged version, the V8-powered S6 was supplied with a four-speed automatic transmission as standard but kept the Quattro four-wheel-drive. A six-speed manual gearbox was also available as an option.

===Audi S6 PLUS===

As a swan song to the C4 platform, an even more powerful, and very limited-production Audi S6 Plus was briefly available to European customers. The S6 Plus, developed by Audi&#x27;s wholly owned high-performance subsidiary, quattro GmbH, was available for sale during the 1997 model year only (production from June 1996 to October 1997). A total of 952 cars were produced; 855 Avants and 97 saloons.

It was powered by another version of the 32-valve (four valves per cylinder) 4.2-litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AHK, later to be seen in the Audi S8 as AKH). Audi&#x27;s performance division reworked key parts of the engine, increasing the maximum power to . It was only available with a revised six-speed manual transmission (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DGU) (gear ratios – 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730), with a final drive ratio of 4.111.

Further revisions were made to the suspension, brakes, and wheels. The front brake discs were enlarged to in diameter by thick. Standard wheels were 8Jx17 &quot;Avus&quot; cast aluminium alloy wheels, with an optional 7Jx16 alloy wheel for use with winter tyres was also available.

The S6 Plus saloon could reach from a standstill in 5.6 seconds, with the Avant a tenth of a second slower at 5.7 seconds.


== C5 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4B, 1997–2004) ==

In February 1997, the introduction of a new A6 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4B), based on a new design automobile platform – the Volkswagen Group C5 platform, with a new range of engines was announced and appeared in March at the 1997 Geneva Motor Show. This A6 was marketed in the same categories as the BMW 5 Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The redesigned body had a coefficient of drag of 0.28.

In 2000 and 2001, the &quot;C5&quot; A6 was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Ten Best&quot; list. This A6 was available with 30-valve 2.4- and 2.8-litre V6 engines, with numerous other engine configurations available globally. As an alternative to the manual transmission, a five-speed tiptronic automatic transmission was also available.

The C5 saloon variant arrived in mid-1997 in Europe, late 1997 in North America and Australia, and the Avant in 1998. In Canada, there was no Avant (Audi&#x27;s name for an estate/wagon) available at all in 1998 – Audi dropped the C4 Avant at the end of the 1997 model year, and jumped straight to the C5 Avant in 1998 in conjunction with its release in the US. As a result of complying with FMVSS, the North American models were equipped with front and rear bumpers that protruded several inches further than their European counterparts, with modified brackets and bumper suspension assemblies as result, and child-seat tethers for occupant safety. In compliance with Canadian law, Canadian models received daytime running lights as standard equipment. North American C5 A6 models received the 2.8-litre, 30-valve V6 engine, the 2.7-litre &quot;Biturbo&quot; V6 (also found in the B5 platform S4, ), and the 4.2-litre 40-valve V8 petrol engine (); the two higher-spec. engines were only offered with quattro permanent four-wheel drive. The V8 models arrived with significantly altered exterior body panels, with slightly more flared wheel arches (fenders), revised headlamps and grille design (before being introduced in 2002 to all other A6 models), larger wheels (8Jx17-inch), larger brakes and Torsen-based Quattro permanent four-wheel-drive as standard.

In 2002, the A6 received a facelift, with revised headlight and grille design, exposed exhaust tips, and slight changes to accessory body moldings, and tail light colour from red to amber in North American models. A new host of engines were also introduced. The 1.8-litre engine was deleted and replaced by a 2.0-litre powerplant with . The 1.9-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) was tweaked to produce a maximum power output of , and of torque, and was mated to a six-speed manual gearbox. The 2.4-litre V6 was named the BDV 30 valves and gained an extra 5 hp and better balancing, and the 2.8-litre V6 engine was replaced by a 3.0-litre engine with . The turbocharged 2.7-litre was revised, resulting in and , controlled by standard quattro system. The V6 diesel was also slightly modified resulting in (after the second modification) and . A new more powerful V6 diesel was also introduced with and . The 4.2-litre V8 engine which arrived in 2001 remained unchanged.

Also new was the multitronic continuously variable transmission, available in most front-wheel drive models. All models, except the 2.0-litre petrol and 1.9-litre TDI, were available with Audi&#x27;s trademark four-wheel-drive system, Quattro. A four-wheel-drive version of the Avant, with raised ground clearance and slightly altered styling, was sold as the Audi allroad quattro, Audi&#x27;s first crossover SUV.

The second-generation A6 was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Ten Best&quot; list for 2000 and 2001. The updated 2005 A6 won the &quot;World Car of the Year&quot; award for 2005. In addition, the facelifted third-generation A6 3.0T won two &quot;Car and Driver&quot; &quot;comparos&quot; that pitted it against other sedans like the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Jaguar XF, and Infiniti M.

A long wheelbase version of the A6 C5 was available in China for the first time, making this model the first stretched German sedan developed especially for that country.

=== S6 and RS 6 ===
The Audi S6 was a high-powered variant of the A6, featuring a modified version of the 4.2-litre V8 engine producing and . It was available as a saloon and Avant although the Avant version was the only one sold in North America.

In the late years of the A6 C5 design, an ultra-high-performance limited-run Audi RS 6 model was presented. Weighing in excess of and producing and , the RS 6 was capable of 0- in 4.5 seconds, and on to in under 17 seconds. Initially available as only an Avant, a saloon variant was later added; the saloon version being the only version available to the North American market. The RS 6 saloon finished first in a May 2003 &quot;Car and Driver&quot; comparison test against the BMW M5 (E39), Mercedes-Benz E 55 AMG (W210), and Jaguar S-Type R.

=== allroad quattro (1999–2005) ===

Audi&#x27;s C5 series A6 Avant formed the basis for a semi-offroad model in 1999, labeled &quot;Audi allroad quattro&quot;. Compared to the regular A6, the allroad featured an advanced air suspension system, allowing for increased ground clearance; larger diameter all-terrain tyres, and flared fenders and bumpers with matte finish, giving it a distinct appearance and more overall flexibility over varying terrain. The allroad&#x27;s ride height was also increased with 25 mm subframe spacers; and overall frame stiffness increased with reinforced welds on the subframe mounts and A, B, and C pillars, the floor pan being produced with 20% thicker steel. As the name &quot;allroad Quattro&quot; suggests, Audi&#x27;s Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel-drive system was standard equipment for all versions.

The standard adjustable air suspension system can lift the car high enough to provide of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other Quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official Land Rover test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing. Conversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension.

Audi&#x27;s 2.7-litre, biturbo V6 petrol engine with and of peak torque was available initially, alongside the 2.5-litre TDI diesel unit with and of torque. A variant of the corporate 4.2-litre V8 petrol engine, was made available in 2003, and a less powerful TDI (163 bhp) followed in 2004.

Audi stopped production of the allroad in July 2005. Although the model continued to be available for sale throughout 2006 in Europe, there was no 2006 model year for North America.

With the return of the &quot;allroad&quot; nameplate to North America, in the form of the 2013 A4 allroad Quattro, the C5-Platform allroad Quattro has begun to take the name &quot;Ur-allroad.&quot; The &#x27;&#x27; is used in the German language, as a prefix to signify &#x27;ancient&#x27; or &#x27;early ancestor&#x27; (e.g., great-grandmother is Urgroßmutter), and is used informally by car enthusiasts worldwide to refer to the &quot;original&quot; Audi Quattro that was produced from 1980 to 1991 (the &quot;Ur-Quattro&quot;). The use of the term was then extended to the original S4 and S6 models to differentiate them from later models with the same name, and more recently to the C5 allroad models (&quot;Ur-allroad&quot;).
=== C5 engines ===
The C5 design was available with the following engines:

== C6 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4F, 2004–2011) ==

===Initial release===
The &quot;Typ&quot; 4F A6 was released in 2004. Designed by Satoshi Wada in 2001, this model is visually an evolution of the C5, but was lengthened to , and has the new Audi &quot;single-frame grille&quot;. Like other contemporary Audis, the A6 has a &quot;tornado line&quot; that runs from the front lights to the rear lights just below the body shoulders.

The C6 iteration of the A6 features more sophisticated technology. Most notable is the Multi Media Interface (MMI), which is a system controlling in-car entertainment, satellite navigation, climate control, car settings such as suspension configuration and optional electronic accessories through a central screen interface. This has the advantage of minimising the wealth of buttons normally found on a dashboard by replacing them with controls that operate multiple devices using the integrated display.

On the engines, the new Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection technology was introduced. Although the line of engines represents the same progression as the former model, all engines were new. The multitronic continuously variable transmission continues as an alternative for front-wheel-drive models, alongside a new six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission model 09E available in the four-wheel-drive models. Audi&#x27;s &quot;trademark&quot; Torsen-based Quattro permanent four-wheel-drive is available in most of the lineup, and standard in the most powerful models. Quattro is &quot;not&quot; available on the Multitronic variants of the A6, but is available on the manual and Tiptronic gear systems. Conversely, the Tiptronic system is not available on the front-wheel-drive variants of the car. The six-speed manual gearbox is available with the 3.2-litre V6 engine, but not for the North American market.

The Avant was previewed by the Audi Avantissimo concept in 2001 and arrived during the course of 2005. The A6 All-road Quattro made its debut in 2006, and as before, is an off-road-ready version of the Avant, available with either a 2.7-litre V6 or 3.0-litre V6 Turbocharged Direct Injection diesel engines, or a 3.2-litre V6 or 4.2-litre V8 petrol engine.

===A6L (2005–2009)===
This is a long wheelbase version of the A6 sedan for the Chinese market. The vehicle was unveiled in 2005 at the Shanghai Motor Show.

The vehicles went on sale in the middle of 2005. Early models include A6L 2.4, with A6L 2.0 TFSI (170 PS) followed shortly after. A6L 3.0 Quattro (218 PS) and A6L 4.2 Quattro (335 PS) were introduced in 2005. Other models include A6 3.0.

===S6===
The Audi S6 performance variant was introduced in the Frankfurt Motor Show, and produced from early 2006 until 2011. It is powered by a 5.2-litre Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) V10 engine producing and of torque. The S6 reaches from a standstill in 5.2 seconds and a quarter mile in 13.5 seconds.

=== A6 allroad quattro (2006–2011) ===

Audi announced the C6 series allroad in 2005 and released it the following year. This model was called the Audi A6 allroad quattro (unlike the previous version, the &quot;Audi allroad quattro&quot;, with no reference to the A6 nomenclature).

The Audi A6 allroad quattro again featured adaptive air suspension and quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. The A6 allroad was powered by a choice of two Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) petrol engines, a 3.2-litre V6 and a 4.2-litre V8, and two TDI diesel engines, a 2.7 L and a (233 only in the US) 3.0 L. The tiptronic gearbox is standard on the 4.2 V8 and the 2.7 TDI, but optional on the 3.2 FSI and 3.0 TDI.

The five-mode air suspension can be raised by up to to provide ground clearance of which is better than the older four-mode.

The car featured a number of off-road styling cues including larger bumpers and sills.

In some European markets, this A6 allroad quattro was more expensive than the larger Audi Q7, but an air suspension is an expensive option in the Q7. In its native country, Germany, it cost a few hundred Euros less than the Q7.

===Engines===
===Awards===
In 2005, the A6 won the &quot;World Car of the Year&quot; award, and has also won the &quot;Practical Caravan&quot; &quot;Towcar of the Year&quot; awards, due to its array of towing features such as adjustable suspension height and damping, and the presence of a 123 Trailer Stability Programme.

=== C6 facelift ===
Audi unveiled a facelifted &quot;C6&quot; Audi A6 on 12 August 2008, at the Moscow International Motor Show. The refresh incorporates some modern Audi design cues to keep the A6 current with the rest of the Audi lineup.

There are minor cosmetic changes to the front and rear lights which now have daytime running LEDs, the taillights extend towards the center of the trunk lid and pinch off at the license plate mount, however, their shape remains rectangular compared to the more sculpted light clusters found in the 2008 Audi A5, 2008 Audi A4, and 2009 Audi Q5 (the latter three being all-new generations).

The intakes below the headlamps are inspired by the Audi RS5. The A6&#x27;s six (per side) front light-emitting diode (LED) daytime running lights (DRLs) are located within the main headlamp housing, similar to RS6&#x27;s placement of the LEDs (ten per side), whereas on the S6 these front LEDs (five per side) are found adjacent to the fog lamps in the lower front bumper.

The new front and rear fascias from RS6 would be used on the facelifted A6 and S6 lineup.

There are now six petrol and four diesel engines available for the upgraded A6. All petrol engines now feature cylinder-direct Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) technology, and all diesel engines now feature common rail (CR) and Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) technologies. There is a new petrol engine, a 3.0L supercharged V6, badged as 3.0 TFSI or 3.0T. This new engine is shared with the B8-generation Audi S4 and S5, although slightly detuned vs. the S-cars, and makes the A6 3.0T only 0.1s slower 0- than the more powerful but heavier 4.2L V8 variant and 5.2L V10-bearing S6.

Also updated for 2009 is the Quattro all-wheel-drive setup, which is already found on the 2008 Audi A5 and 2008 Audi A4. This new system features a 40/60 front-to-rear torque split and offers a more balanced feel, reducing the understeer that comes from 50/50 AWD platforms.

US models went on sale as 2009 model year vehicles, and arrived in U.S. dealerships by the beginning of January. Early models include A6 3.2 FSI (sedan), A6 3.0 TFSI quattro (sedan/Avant), A6 4.2 FSI quattro (sedan), S6 5.2 FSI (sedan).

===RS6 (2008–2010)===

The latest version of ultra-high-performance Audi RS6 was launched in September 2008 and produced until the third quarter of 2010. Based upon the V10 engine powering the S6, the RS6 features an all-aluminium alloy V10 twin-turbocharged, Fuel Stratified Injection engine with a dry sump lubrication system. It produces a power output of , and of torque, making it the most powerful vehicle ever produced by Audi at the time. This has now been surpassed by the Audi R8.

Initially available only as an Avant, the saloon version went on sale in mid-October 2008.

===A6L (2009–2012)===

The A6L is a longer wheelbase version of the A6 sedan for the Chinese market. The vehicle was unveiled at Auto Shanghai 2009. Early models included the 2.7 TDI powerplant (189 PS).

The Audi A6L was also converted into the form of a pickup truck although only two examples are known to exist on the roads.

== C7 (&quot;Typ&quot; 4G, 2011–2018) ==
===Initial release===
The fourth generation C7 series Audi A6 (internally designated Typ 4G) was launched in early 2011 for the European market and in other markets soon after. It is heavily influenced by the Audi A8 (D4), pulling elements from its exterior details. The A6 shares its interior, platform, and powertrain (Modular Longitudinal Platform) with the Audi A7 four door sedan, which had been released shortly before also in 2011. Compared to the A8 and A7, the A6 has the most aggressive front fascia and LED headlights (optional full LED headlamps). Design work began in 2006, with Jurgen Loffler&#x27;s exterior design being chosen in 2008.

The new A6 increased its wheelbase by nearly and its width by . The redesign also decreased the car&#x27;s drag coefficient to 0.25.

European engine choices for the C7 include two petrol engines – a 2.8-litre FSI V6 with and a , 3.0-litre supercharged FSI engine – and two diesel engines – a 2.0-litre inline four-cylinder and a 3.0-litre turbocharged diesel engine in three states of tune. The European A6 3.0 TFSI will have an optional seven-speed dual-clutch transmission and an air suspension option, two features that will not be available on the United States model.

For North America, the Audi A6 3.0 TFSI quattro came with a 3.0-litre supercharged V6 putting out and , the same engine carried over from the previous-generation A6 3.0 TFSI, but in a higher state of tune and mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. There is also an Audi A6 2.0 TFSI quattro powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged inline-four, the same engine in the Audi A4 and Q5, mated to an eight-speed automatic transmission. For the United States but not the Canadian market, there will be an entry-level Audi A6 2.0 TFSI FrontTrak (front-wheel drive) with a 2.0-litre turbocharged inline-four, the same engine in the Audi A4 and Q5, but mated to the Multitronic CVT (continuous variable transmission).

The 2012 model year A6 features all the driver assistance systems from the A8, plus it adds automotive head-up display, active lane assist. Full LED headlamps with Automatic high beam switching or Audi adaptive light (Xenon) with variable headlight range control.

===C7 facelift (2015–2018)===
Audi unveiled the 2015 C7 mid-life facelift at the 2014 Paris Motor Show. The refresh includes styling tweaks to the car&#x27;s exterior, engine line-up, transmission and MMI infotainment system with faster Tegra 3 processor, Handwriting recognition, Audi connect Telematics with 4G mobile internet (and online updates for the navigation map), and advanced Matrix LED headlights.

All three TFSI 1.8tfsi and five TDI engines now meet the Euro 6 emission standard. The new TDI Ultra model now comes with glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) springs and both ultra models now come with S-Tronic (dual-clutch) transmission. The entry-level Audi A6 2.0 TFSI FrontTrak (front-wheel drive) with a 2.0-litre turbocharged inline-four, received a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic that replaced the previous Multitronic CVT (continuously variable transmission).

===A6 hybrid (2012–2014)===

A hybrid electric variant was also available for the first time in the A6, offering a 2-litre TFSI engine combined with a electric motor. Electric power is supplied via a 1.3 kWh lithium-ion battery, with electric-only range of 3 km for constant drive and a top speed of .

The market launch of the A6 Hybrid was scheduled for 2012. However, production of the US model was delayed.

The Audi A6 hybrid was discontinued due to low sales in 2014 after roughly 4,000 units sold.
===A6 allroad quattro (2012–2018)===
The 2013 A6 allroad Quattro was unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show, alongside the 2012 RS4 Avant. Sales began in 2012. The first UK deliveries arrived in July 2012.

The allroad variant contains several unique features. Audi designed more than 1,100 new, unique parts for the allroad, setting it apart from the standard A6 and making it a true all-terrain vehicle. Most obvious, the allroad received special bumpers and fender flares, giving it an aggressive offroad appearance. The bumpers and fender flares feature a tough-wearing, matte finish, contrasting the rest of the body. The roof received this same coating, as well as four longitudinal ribs for increased strength. The unique bumpers also have integrated aluminum skid plates. The allroad featured larger diameter tires than the standard A6 for improved offroad capabilities. Redesigned headlights, larger side mirrors, and a lack of door &quot;rub strips&quot; are unique to the allroad.
The allroad comes standard with an adjustable air suspension system can lift the car high enough to provide of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official Land Rover test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing.

Conversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension.

It went on sale in spring 2012. Early variants included 3.0 TFSI quattro (310 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (204 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (245 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (313 PS).

===Production===
Following the launch of the new A6, Audi officially stopped production of the A6 and A7 TDI vehicles using V6 TDI Gen2 evo EU6 engines due to an investigation on newly discovered emissions cheating software.

==Use in China==
According to Dunne &amp; Company, a research company, as of 2011, purchases in China and Hong Kong make up about half of the 229,200 Audi A6s sold in the world. By 2012 many government officials in China began driving with Audi A6s. After a 1994 campaign from the Chinese government to have officials stop driving Mercedes stretch limousines, the officials began using black Audi A6 cars. Michael Wines of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;More than a perk, the black Audi is a rolling advertisement for its occupant’s importance and impunity in a nation obsessed with status.&quot;

==Cancelled renaming==
In March 2023, Audi CEO Markus Duesmann confirmed that the A4 would be renamed the A5, while the A6 would become the A7, with the future A4 etron and A6 etron to be sold as electric vehicles only. In February 2025, this renaming was cancelled, and the new petrol powered A7 will be the A6.

<text>Brodmann area 40 (BA40) is part of the parietalcortex in the human brain. The inferior part of BA40 is in the area of the supramarginal gyrus, which lies at the posterior end of the lateral fissure, in the inferior lateral part of the parietal lobe.

It is bounded approximately by the intraparietal sulcus, the inferior postcentral sulcus, the posterior subcentral sulcus and the lateral sulcus. It is bounded caudally by the angular area 39 (H), rostrally and dorsally by the caudal postcentral area 2, and ventrally by the subcentral area 43 and the superior temporal area 22 (Brodmann-1909). 

Cytoarchitectonically defined subregions of rostral BA40/the supramarginal gyrus are PF, PFcm, PFm, PFop, and PFt. Area PF is the homologue to macaque area PF, part of the mirror neuron system, and active in humans during imitation.

==Function==
The supramarginal gyrus part of Brodmann area 40 is the region in the inferior parietal lobe that is involved in reading both as regards meaning and phonology.

<doc id="540034" wikidata="Q816798" url="?curid=540034" title="Amyloidosis">
<text>Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins, known as amyloid fibrils, build up in tissue. There are several non-specific and vague signs and symptoms associated with amyloidosis. These include fatigue, peripheral edema, weight loss, shortness of breath, palpitations, and feeling faint with standing. In AL amyloidosis, specific indicators can include enlargement of the tongue and periorbital purpura. In wild-type ATTR amyloidosis, non-cardiac symptoms include: bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, biceps tendon rupture, small fiber neuropathy, and autonomic dysfunction.

There are about 36 different types of amyloidosis, each due to a specific protein misfolding. Within these 36 proteins, 19 are grouped into localized forms, 14 are grouped as systemic forms, and three proteins can identify as either. These proteins can become irregular due to genetic effects, as well as through acquired environmental factors. The four most common types of systemic amyloidosis are light chain (AL), inflammation (AA), dialysis-related (Aβ2M), and hereditary and old age (ATTR and wild-type transthyretin amyloid).

Diagnosis may be suspected when protein is found in the urine, organ enlargement is present, or problems are found with multiple peripheral nerves and it is unclear why. Diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy. Due to the variable presentation, a diagnosis can often take some time to reach.

Treatment is geared towards decreasing the amount of the involved protein. This may sometimes be achieved by determining and treating the underlying cause. AL amyloidosis occurs in about 3–13 per million people per year and AA amyloidosis in about two per million people per year. The usual age of onset of these two types is 55 to 60 years old. Without treatment, life expectancy is between six months and four years. In the developed world about one per 1,000 deaths are from systemic amyloidosis. Amyloidosis has been described since at least 1639.

== Signs and symptoms ==

The presentation of amyloidosis is broad and depends on the site of amyloid accumulation. The kidney and heart are the most common organs involved.

===Kidneys===
Amyloid deposition in the kidney often involve the glomerular capillaries and mesangial regions, affecting the organ&#x27;s ability to filter and excrete waste and retain plasma protein. This can lead to high levels of protein in the urine (proteinuria) and nephrotic syndrome. Several types of amyloidosis, including the AL and AA types, are associated with nephrotic syndrome. Approximately 20% and 40–60% of people with AL and AA amyloidosis respectively progress to end-stage kidney disease requiring dialysis.

===Heart===

Amyloid deposition in the heart can cause both diastolic and systolic heart failure. EKG changes may be present, showing low voltage and conduction abnormalities like atrioventricular block or sinus node dysfunction. On echocardiography, the heart shows a restrictive filling pattern, with normal to mildly reduced systolic function. AA amyloidosis usually spares the heart. Cardiac amyloidosis can present with symptoms of heart failure including shortness of breath, fatigue, and edema. As cardiac amyloidosis progresses, the amyloid deposition can affect the heart&#x27;s ability to pump and fill blood as well as its ability to maintain normal rhythm, which leads to worsening heart function and decline in people&#x27;s quality of life.

===Nervous system===
People with amyloidosis may have central nervous system involvement, along with peripheral involvement which causes sensory and autonomic neuropathies. Sensory neuropathy develops in a symmetrical pattern and progresses in a distal to proximal manner. Autonomic neuropathy can present as orthostatic hypotension but may manifest more gradually with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms like constipation, nausea, or early satiety. Amyloidosis of the central nervous system can have more severe and systemic presentations that may include life-threatening arrhythmias, cardiac failure, malnutrition, infection, or death.

Neuropathic presentation can depend on the etiology of amyloidosis. People with amyloidosis may experience dysfunction in various organ systems depending on the location and extent of nervous system involvement. For example, peripheral neuropathy can cause erectile dysfunction, incontinence and constipation, pupillary dysfunction, and sensory loss depending on the distribution of amyloidosis along different peripheral nerves.

===Gastrointestinal and accessory organs===
Accumulation of amyloid proteins in the gastrointestinal system may be caused by a wide range of amyloid disorders and have different presentations depending on the degree of organ involvement. Potential symptoms include weight loss, diarrhea, abdominal pain, heartburn (gastrointestinal reflux), and GI bleeding. Amyloidosis may also affect accessory digestive organs including the liver, and may present with jaundice, fatty stool, anorexia, fluid buildup in the abdomen, and spleen enlargement.

Accumulation of amyloid proteins in the liver can lead to elevations in serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase, two biomarkers of liver injury, which is seen in about one third of people. Liver enlargement is common. In contrast, spleen enlargement is rare, occurring in 5% of people. Splenic dysfunction, leading to the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies on blood smear, occurs in 24% of people with amyloidosis. Malabsorption is seen in 8.5% of AL amyloidosis and 2.4% of AA amyloidosis. One suggested mechanism for the observed malabsorption is that amyloid deposits in the tips of intestinal villi (fingerlike projections that increase the intestinal area available for absorption of food), begin to erode the functionality of the villi, presenting a sprue-like picture.

===Glands===
Both the thyroid and adrenal glands can be infiltrated. It is estimated that 10–20% of people with amyloidosis have hypothyroidism. Adrenal infiltration may be harder to appreciate given that its symptoms of orthostatic hypotension and low blood sodium concentration may be attributed to autonomic neuropathy and heart failure.

&quot;Amyloid deposits occur in the pancreas of people who also have diabetes mellitus, although it is not known if this is functionally important. The major component of pancreatic amyloid is a 37-amino acid residue peptide known as islet amyloid polypeptide or &#x27;amylin.&#x27; This is stored with insulin in secretory granules in [beta] cells and is co secreted with insulin.&quot; (Rang and Dale&#x27;s Pharmacology, 2015.)

===Musculoskeletal system===
Amyloid proteins deposit most commonly inside the knee, followed by hands, wrists, elbow, hip, and ankle, causing joint pain. In males with advanced age (&gt;80 years), there is significant risk of wild-type transthyretin amyloid deposition in synovial tissue of knee joint, but predominantly in old age deposition of wild type transthyretin is seen in cardiac ventricles. ATTR deposits have been found in ligamentum flavum of patients that underwent surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis.

In beta 2-microglobulin amyloidosis, males have high risk of getting carpal tunnel syndrome. Aβ2MG amyloidosis (Hemodialysis associated amyloidosis) tends to deposit in synovial tissue, causing chronic inflammation of the synovial tissue in knee, hip, shoulder and interphalangeal joints. Amyloid light chains deposition in shoulder joint causes enlarged shoulders, also known as &quot;shoulder pad sign&quot;. Amyloid light chain depositions can also cause bilateral symmetric polyarthritis.

The deposition of amyloid proteins in the bone marrow without causing plasma cell dyscrasias is called amyloidoma. It is commonly found in cervical, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae. Those affected may be presented with bone pain due to bone lysis, lumbar paraparesis, and a variety of neurological symptoms. Vertebral fractures are also common.

===Eyes===
A rare development is amyloid purpura, a susceptibility to bleeding with bruising around the eyes, termed &quot;raccoon-eyes&quot;. Amyloid purpura is caused by amyloid deposition in the blood vessels and reduced activity of thrombin and factor X, two clotting proteins that lose their function after binding with amyloid.

===Oral cavity===
Amyloid deposits in tissue can cause enlargement of structures. Twenty percent of people with AL amyloidosis have an enlarged tongue, that can lead to obstructive sleep apnea, difficulty swallowing, and altered taste. Tongue enlargement does not occur in ATTR or AA amyloidosis. Deposition of amyloid in the throat can cause hoarseness.

==Pathogenesis==

Amyloidoses can be considered protein misfolding diseases. The vast majority of proteins that have been found to form amyloid deposits are secreted proteins, so the misfolding and formation of amyloid occurs outside cells, in the extracellular space. Of the 37 proteins so far identified as being vulnerable to amyloid formation, only four are cytosolic. Most amyloid-forming proteins are relatively small, but otherwise there is currently no evidence of structural or functional similarities among proteins known to form disease-associated amyloids. One third of amyloid disease is hereditary, in which case there is normally an early age of onset. Half of amyloid-related diseases are sporadic and have a late age of onset – in these cases, the protein aggregation may be associated with aging-related decline in protein regulation. Some medical treatments are associated with amyloid disease, but this is rare.

Amyloid-forming proteins aggregate into distinctive fibrillar forms with a beta-sheet structure. The beta-sheet form of amyloid is proteolysis-resistant, meaning it can not be degraded or broken down. As a result, amyloid deposits into the body&#x27;s extracellular space. The process of forming amyloid fibrils is thought to have intermediate oligomeric forms. Both the oligomers and amyloid fibrils can be toxic to cells and can interfere with proper organ function. The relative significance of different aggregation species may depend on the protein involved and the organ system affected.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of amyloidosis generally requires tissue biopsy. The biopsy is assessed for evidence of characteristic amyloid deposits. The tissue is treated with various stains. The most useful stain in the diagnosis of amyloid is Congo red, which, combined with polarized light, makes the amyloid proteins appear apple-green on microscopy. Also, thioflavin T stain may be used. A number of imaging techniques such as a Nuclear Medicine PYP scan, DPD scan or SAP scan are also in use.

A sample of tissue can be biopsied or obtained directly from the affected internal organ, but the first-line site of biopsy is subcutaneous abdominal fat, known as a &quot;fat pad biopsy&quot;, due to its ease of acquisition. An abdominal fat biopsy is not completely sensitive and may result in false negatives, which means a negative result does not exclude the diagnosis of amyloidosis. However, direct biopsy of the affected organ may still be unnecessary as other less invasive methods of biopsy can also be used, including rectal mucosa, salivary gland, lip, or bone marrow biopsy which can achieve a diagnosis in up to 85% of people.

In the amyloid deposition of the joints, there will be a decreased signal in both T1 and T2 weighted MRI images. In amyloidoma, there will be low T1 signal with gadolinium injection and low T2 signal.

The type of the amyloid protein can be determined in various ways: the detection of abnormal proteins in the bloodstream (on protein electrophoresis or light chain determination); binding of particular antibodies to the amyloid found in the tissue (immunohistochemistry); or extraction of the protein and identification of its individual amino acids. Immunohistochemistry can identify AA amyloidosis the majority of the time, but can miss many cases of AL amyloidosis. Laser microdissection with mass spectrometry is the most reliable method of identifying the different forms of amyloidosis.

AL was previously considered the most common form of amyloidosis, and a diagnosis often begins with a search for plasma cell dyscrasia, memory B cells producing aberrant immunoglobulins or portions of immunoglobulins. Immunofixation electrophoresis of urine or serum is positive in 90% of people with AL amyloidosis. Immunofixation electrophoresis is more sensitive than regular electrophoresis but may not be available in all centers. Alternatively immunohistochemical staining of a bone marrow biopsy looking for dominant plasma cells can be sought in people with a high clinical suspicion for AL amyloidosis but negative electrophoresis.

ATTR is now considered to be the most common form of amyloidosis. It may be either age related in wild-type ATTR (ATTRv) or familial transthyretin-associated amyloidosis, is suspected in people with family history of idiopathic neuropathies or heart failure who lack evidence of plasma cell dyscrasias. ATTR can be identified using isoelectric focusing which separates mutated forms of transthyretin. Findings can be corroborated by genetic testing to look for specific known mutations in transthyretin that predispose to amyloidosis.

AA is suspected on clinical grounds in individuals with longstanding infections or inflammatory diseases. AA can be identified by immunohistochemistry staining.

=== Classification ===
Historical classification systems were based on clinical factors. Until the early 1970s, the idea of a single amyloid substance predominated. Various descriptive classification systems were proposed based on the organ distribution of amyloid deposits and clinical findings. Most classification systems included primary (i.e., idiopathic) amyloidosis, in which no associated clinical condition was identified, and secondary amyloidosis (i.e., to chronic inflammatory conditions). Some classification systems included myeloma-associated, familial, and localized amyloidosis.

The modern era of amyloidosis classification began in the late 1960s with the development of methods to make amyloid fibrils soluble. These methods permitted scientists to study the chemical properties of amyloids. Descriptive terms such as primary amyloidosis, secondary amyloidosis, and others (e.g., senile amyloidosis), which are not based on cause, provide little useful information and are no longer recommended.

The modern classification of amyloid disease tends to use an abbreviation of the protein that makes the majority of deposits, prefixed with the letter A. For example, amyloidosis caused by transthyretin is termed &quot;ATTR&quot;. Deposition patterns vary between people but are almost always composed of just one amyloidogenic protein. Deposition can be systemic (affecting many different organ systems) or organ-specific. Many amyloidoses are inherited, due to mutations in the precursor protein.

Other forms are due to different diseases causing overabundant or abnormal protein production – such as with overproduction of immunoglobulin light chains (termed AL amyloidosis), or with continuous overproduction of acute phase proteins in chronic inflammation (which can lead to AA amyloidosis).

About 60 amyloid proteins have been identified so far. Of those, at least 36 have been associated with a human disease.

All amyloid fibril proteins start with the letter &quot;A&quot; followed by the protein suffix (and any applicable specification). See below for a list of amyloid fibril proteins which have been found in humans:
====Alternative====
An older clinical method of classification refers to amyloidoses as systemic or localised:
* Systemic amyloidoses affect more than one body organ or system. Examples are AL, AA and Aβ2m.
* Localised amyloidoses affect only one body organ or tissue type. Examples are Aβ, IAPP, Atrial natriuretic factor (in isolated atrial amyloidosis), and Calcitonin (in medullary carcinoma of the thyroid)

Another classification is primary or secondary.
* Primary amyloidoses arise from a disease with disordered immune cell function, such as multiple myeloma or other immunocyte dyscrasias.
* Secondary (reactive) amyloidoses occur as a complication of some other chronic inflammatory or tissue-destroying disease. Examples are reactive systemic amyloidosis and secondary cutaneous amyloidosis.

Additionally, based on the tissues in which it is deposited, it is divided into mesenchymal (organs derived from mesoderm) or parenchymal (organs derived from ectoderm or endoderm).

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the type of amyloidosis that is present. Treatment with high dose melphalan, a chemotherapy agent, followed by stem cell transplantation has shown promise in early studies and is recommended for stage I and II AL amyloidosis. However, only 20–25% of people are eligible for stem cell transplant. Chemotherapy treatment including cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone-daratumumab (Dara-Cybord) is currently the recommended treatment option for people with AL Amyloidosis not eligible for transplant.

In AA, symptoms may improve if the underlying condition is treated. In people who have inflammation caused by AA amyloidosis, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors such as infliximab and etanercept are used for an average duration of 20 months. If TNF-alpha inhibitors are not effective, Interleukin-1 inhibitors (e.g., anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept) and interleukin-6 inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab) may be considered.

Management of ATTR amyloidosis will depend on its classification as wild type or variant. Both may be treated with tafamidis, a low toxicity oral agent that prevents destabilization of correctly folded protein. Studies showed tafamidis reduced mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure. Previously, for variant ATTR amyloidosis, liver transplant was the only effective treatment. New therapies include diflunisal, inotersen, and patisiran.

Diflunisal binds to misfolded mutant TTR protein to prevent its buildup, like how tafamidis works. Low-certainty evidence indicates that it mitigates worsening of peripheral neuropathy and disability from disease progression.

Inotersen blocks gene expression of both wild-type and mutant TTR, reducing amyloid precursor. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that it mitigates worsening of peripheral neuropathy. Long-term efficacy and safety of inotersen use in people with mutant TTR-related amyloidosis is still be evaluated in a phase-III clinical trial as of 2021. Both diflunisal and inotersen may also mitigate declines in quality-of-life, though the evidence for this effect is unclear. For people with cardiac ATTR the effect of inotersen use is inconclusive and requires further investigation. In 2018, inotersen was approved by the European Medicines Agency to treat polyneuropathy in adults with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. It has since been approved for use in Canada, the European Union and in the USA.

Patisiran functions similarly to inotersen. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that patisiran mitigates worsening of peripheral neuropathy and disability from disease progression. Additionally, low-certainty evidence suggests that patisiran mitigates decreases in quality-of-life and slightly reduces the rate of adverse events versus placebo. There is no evidence of an effect on mortality rate. A review of early data from use of patisiran in people with variant cardiac ATTR suggests that it may reduce mortality and hospitalization, however this is still being investigated and requires further investigation. In 2018, patisiran was not recommended by NICE in the UK for hereditary transthyretin-related amyloidosis. As of July 2019 further review however is occurring. It was approved for this use in the United States, however.

The roles of inotersen and patisiran in cardiac ATTR amyloidosis are still being investigated.

In 2021, in a clinical trial using the CRISPR gene-editing technique, several participants had an &quot;80% to 96% drop in TTR levels, on par or better than the average of 81%&quot; who were given patisiran.

Vutrisiran was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in June 2022, for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis in adults.

===Support groups===
People affected by amyloidosis are supported by organizations, including the Amyloidosis Research Consortium, Amyloidosis Foundation, Amyloidosis Support Groups, and Australian Amyloidosis Network.

== Prognosis ==
Prognosis varies with the type of amyloidosis and the affected organ system. Prognosis for untreated AL cardiac amyloidosis is poor, with a median survival of six months. More specifically, AL amyloidosis can be classified as stage I, II or III based on cardiac biomarkers like Nt-proBNP and cardiac troponin. Survival diminishes with increasing stage, but recent advancements in treatments have improved median survival rates for stages I, II, and III, to 91.2, 60, and 7 months respectively.

Outcomes in a person with AA amyloidosis depend on the underlying disease, organ(s) affected, and correlate with the concentration of serum amyloid A protein.

People with ATTR, mutant ATTR and wild-type ATTR have a better prognosis when compared to people with AL and may survive for over a decade. Survival time is not associated with gender or age, however, some measures of reduced heart function are associated with a shorter survival time.

Senile systemic amyloidosis was determined to be the primary cause of death for 70% of people over 110 who have been autopsied.

== Epidemiology ==
Amyloidosis has a combined estimated prevalence of 30 per 100,000 persons with the three most common forms being AL, ATTR, and AA. The median age at diagnosis is 64.

AL has the highest incidence at approximately 12 cases per million persons per year and an estimated prevalence of 30,000 to 45,000 cases in the US and European Union.

AA amyloidoses is the most common form in developing countries and can complicate longstanding infections with tuberculosis, osteomyelitis, and bronchiectasis. AA amyloidosis is caused by an increase in extracellular deposition of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. SAA protein levels can rise in both direct and indirect manners, through infection, inflammation, and malignancies. The most common causes of AA amyloidosis in the West are rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and familial Mediterranean fever.

People undergoing long-term hemodialysis (14–15 years) can develop amyloidosis from accumulation of light chains of the HLA 1 complex which is normally filtered out by the kidneys.

Wild-type transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is found in a quarter of elderly at postmortem. ATTR is found in 13–19% of people experiencing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, making it a very common form of systemic amyloidosis.

==Research==
Treatments for ATTR-related neuropathy include TTR-specific oligonucleotides in the form of small interfering RNA (patisiran) or antisense inotersen, the former having recently received FDA approval. Research into treatments for ATTR amyloidosis have compared liver transplantation, oral drugs that stabilize the misfolding protein (including tafamidis and diflunisal), and newer therapeutic agents still being investigated (including patisiran). 

Based on available research, liver transplant remains the most effective treatment option for advanced ATTR amyloidosis, protein stabilizing drugs may slow disease progression but were insufficient to justify delay of liver transplant, and newer agents such as patisiran require additional studies.

<text>Glodwick is an area of Oldham, Greater Manchester, England. It is south-east of Oldham town centre.

Glodwick is a multi-ethnic residential area in the south of Oldham, home particularly to a large community of Pakistanis and British Pakistanis.

Glodwick is marked architecturally by Oldham&#x27;s history with the Industrial Revolution, particularly [[Spinning (textiles)originally as dwellings for Oldham&#x27;s many [[cotton mill]] workers.

==History==
===Etymology===
The name &quot;Glodwick&quot; was recorded first as &quot;Glodic&quot; in the 1190s. The first element may be a [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] word related to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] &quot;clawdd&quot;, meaning &quot;ditch, hedge&quot;. [[Gloddaeth Hall|Gloddaeth]] in Wales may have a similar etymology. The second part of the name is harder to explain, but may be the [[Old English]] &quot;dic&quot;, likewise meaning &quot;ditch&quot;, added later to the Brittonic word.

===Medieval history===
Lying within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Lancashire]] [[History of Lancashire|since the early 12th century]], Glodwick, one of the oldest parts of Oldham, was recorded in 1212 as being one of five parts of the [[thegn]]age estate of Kaskenmoor, which was held on behalf of [[John of England|King John]] by [[Roger de Montbegon]] and William de Nevill. The other parts of this estate were [[Shaw and Crompton|Crompton]], [[Oldham]], [[Sholver]] and [[Werneth, Greater Manchester|Werneth]]. Glodwick later formed part of the [[township (England)|township]] of Oldham within the ancient ecclesiastical parish of [[Prestwich-cum-Oldham]], in the [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salford]].

===Industrial revolution===
In the late-19th and early-20th centuries, Glodwick provided a base for many of the [[cotton mill]]s that made Oldham the most productive [[mill town]] in the world. Spinning companies like Samuel Milne, Lees &amp; Wrigley, James Collinge &amp; Sons and [[Bagley &amp; Wright]] brought employment to the area.

===Riots===

In May 2001, Glodwick was the centre of controversy as it was at the heart of the &quot;[[Oldham Riots]]&quot; - large scale rioting said to be fuelled by long-term under-lying racial tensions between local [[White people|white]] and [[South Asian]] communities. The rioting gained international media coverage, and were said to be the worst [[race riot|racially-motivated riots]] in the United Kingdom for fifteen years prior, briefly eclipsing the sectarian violence seen in [[Northern Ireland]].

==Landmarks==

One of Glodwick&#x27;s best-known features is [[Alexandra Park, Oldham|Alexandra Park]].

Greengate Street Mosque is Oldham&#x27;s largest mosque.

St Mark&#x27;s Church stands on the hill above Oldham at Glodwick. It is the parish church for the area.

===Lowside Brickworks===
Close to Glodwick is a disused quarry that has been designated as a [[Site of special scientific interest]] (SSSI) known as Lowside Brickworks. The site is only but has considerable geological interest. It has yielded [[bivalves]] from the [[Carboniferous]] period showing how they interacted with the sediment, which also helps understanding of their [[Morphology (biology)|morphological variation]]. Lowside Brickworks is one of 21 [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater Manchester|SSSIs in the Greater Manchester area]].

==Second World War==
On 24 December 1944, at 5.50am, a [[V-1 flying bomb]] fell on Abbey Hills Road near to the junction with Warren Lane. The explosion killed 32 people and destroyed a large number of houses. The bomb was one of over thirty released that morning by a large formation of German [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers just off the [[North East England|North East coast of England]].

==Transport==
There are a few bus services that serve the Glodwick area. [[First Greater Manchester]]&#x27;s frequent 425 service runs through Glodwick to Holts Estate via Abbeyhills and to Fitton Hill via Oldham. First&#x27;s 408 service runs a handful of service to [[Stalybridge]] via Abbeyhills and [[Shaw, Greater Manchester|Shaw]] via Oldham during the day on weekdays, while [[Manchester Community Transport]] runs an hourly evening service and [[Stagecoach Manchester]] runs the Sunday service. The 410 and 411 services, operated by [[Manchester Community Transport]], provide a circular service around various parts of east Oldham running along Waterloo Street in Glodwick.

There is no railway station nearby, [[Glodwick Road railway station|Glodwick Road]] station having closed in 1955, but there is a nearby [[Manchester Metrolink|Metrolink]] stop, which is [[Oldham Mumps Metrolink station|Oldham Mumps]], currently providing links to Manchester and [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy|Chorlton]].

==Notable people==
*[[William Joyce]], was a short-term resident of Glodwick.
*Joseph Lees (1748–1824) - regional dialect poet from Glodwick, who wrote &quot;[[Jone o Grinfilt]]&quot;. He was a hand-loom weaver and schoolteacher accustomed to &quot;study on his seatboard, and when he had thrown a few ideas into rhyme he stopt picking-o&#x27;er and wrote it down&quot;.

<doc id="540048" wikidata="Q407842" url="?curid=540048" title="Air Tanzania">
<text>Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) () is the flag carrier airline of Tanzania. It is based in Dar es Salaam, with its hub at Julius Nyerere International Airport.

It was established as Air Tanzania Corporation (ATC) in 1977 after the dissolution of East African Airways and has been a member of the African Airlines Association since its inception. The airline was wholly owned by the Tanzanian government until 2002 when it was partially privatised in partnership with South African Airways, but the government repurchased the shares in 2006, making it once again a wholly owned government company.

In 2016, the Tanzanian government under President John Magufuli initiated a new drive to revive the national carrier by acquiring additional aircraft from Bombardier and Boeing. The airline further intended to double its fleet to 14 aircraft by 2022 and increase its long-haul and regional routes.

A 2021 government report by the Auditor General warned about the company&#x27;s huge debts. Air Tanzania flights flying abroad ran the risk of being impounded due to huge debts incurred by the company. Despite the warnings, the government of Tanzania continued to finance the airline and announced its biggest bailout of US$194 million for the airline.

==History==
===Air Tanzania Corporation (1977–2002)===
The Air Tanzania Corporation (ATC) was established on 11 March 1977 after the break-up of East African Airways (EAA), which had previously served the region. The liquidation of EAA followed its accumulation of US$120 million of debt. According to Andy Chande, the founding chairman of the board, Tanzania and Uganda did not receive a fair share of the former carrier&#x27;s assets despite being equal partners. 

The airline commenced operations with a Douglas DC-9-32 leased from Kenya Airways and purchased an additional two Boeing 737, financed by a U.S. bank. It also leased aircraft from Air Madagascar. Four Fokker F27s and four DHC-6-300 Twin Otters were added in 1980. Because of less demand, two of the Fokker 27s were made obsolete in 1981. These aircraft returned to service in 1983 but were once again removed.

In May 1991, Air Tanzania began operating a Boeing 767-200ER that was leased from Ethiopian Airlines, but this aircraft proved to be too large and was returned to the lessor in February 1992. The airline reported a profit of US$650,000 in 1994.
During the 1990s, the airline&#x27;s acronym ATC was humorously referred to as &quot;Any Time Cancellation&quot; due to its unpredictable flight schedule.

====Alliance Air====

In 1994, Air Tanzania joined with Uganda Airlines and South African Airways (SAA) to form Alliance Air. Air Tanzania had a 10 percent stake in the venture. Flights operated from Dar es Salaam to London–Heathrow via Entebbe on a Boeing 747SP initially, and then a smaller Boeing 767-200. This venture ceased operations in October 2000 after accumulating losses of about US$50 million. The losses had been funded by Transnet, the parent company of SAA, through April 2000. When Transnet refused to continue funding the deficit, Air Tanzania accused SAA of using Alliance Air &quot;as a Trojan Horse to take over national airlines in the region&quot;. In February 2002, the government began the process of privatising ATC through the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission. Advertisements were placed in the local, regional, and international media inviting potential bidders. The International Finance Corporation advised the government in this transaction. The government had approved a transaction structure that included:

*Creation of a new company, &quot;Air Tanzania Company Limited&quot;, which would be incorporated as a limited liability company under the Companies Act to take over the operating assets and specified rights and liabilities of ATC.
*A second new company, &quot;Air Tanzania Holding Company&quot;, would be created to take over the non-operating assets and all other liabilities of ATC.

Eight airlines submitted expressions of interest:
* Aero Asia International (Pakistan)
* Air Consult International (Ireland)
* Comair (South Africa)
* Air Gulf Falcon (United Arab Emirates)
* Kenya Airways (Kenya)
* Nationwide Airlines (South Africa)
* Precision Air (Tanzania)
* South African Airways (South Africa)

Of the eight, four airlines carried out due diligence – South African Airways, Kenya Airways, Comair, and Nationwide Airlines. By 19 September 2002, the bid deadline date, only SAA had submitted a bid. Kenya Airways and Nationwide Airlines had informed the government that they did not intend to submit bids.

===ATCL (2002–2006)===

The Tanzanian government selected SAA as the winning bidder. After signing an agreement with the government, SAA in December 2002 purchased a 49 percent stake in Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) for US$20 million. US$10 million was the value of the government&#x27;s shares, and the remaining US$10 million was for the Capital and Training Account for financing Air Tanzania&#x27;s proposed business plan.

As the strategic partner, SAA planned to create its East African hub in Dar es Salaam to form a &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; between southern, eastern, and western Africa. It intended to replace ATCL&#x27;s fleet with Boeing 737-800s, 737-200s, and 767-300s; and planned to introduce regional routes, including routes to the Middle East and West Africa. The government was expected to sell 10 percent of its stake to a private Tanzanian investor, thereby reducing the government&#x27;s ownership to a non-controlling interest of 41% n ATCL.

The new Air Tanzania airline was launched on 31 March 2003, offering direct flights from Dar es Salaam to Johannesburg, Zanzibar and Kilimanjaro.

Air Tanzania recorded a pre-tax loss of almost US$7.3 million in its first year following privatisation. The loss was attributed mainly to the inability to expand the network as quickly and extensively as originally planned. It had been hoped to launch services to Dubai, India, and Europe, but these were delayed as Air Tanzania had only had short-haul Boeing 737-200s in its fleet. The development of Dar es Salaam as an East African hub for the SAA alliance had also not proceeded as quickly as planned.

On 31 January 2005, Air Tanzania suspended one of its few regional services, Dar es Salaam to Nairobi, following intense competition from Kenya Airways on the route. The airline, however, reaffirmed its intention to launch long-haul services within a year from Dar es Salaam to Dubai, London, Mumbai, and Muscat.

The Tanzanian government announced on 31 March 2006 that it would dispose of ATCL following four years of losses, which amounted to US$20.5 million (TZS.24.7 billion). The director-general of the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority, Margaret Munyagi, said: &quot;Air Tanzania was in a worse state than before it was taken over by SAA.&quot; SAA, however, claimed the Tanzanian government was &quot;not serious&quot; for failing to release about US$30 million, which was needed to implement Air Tanzania&#x27;s business strategy to reverse continued losses.

On 7 September 2006, the Tanzanian government bought SAA&#x27;s 49 percent stake in ATCL for US$1 million, officially terminating its partnership with SAA. The venture collapsed due to the partners&#x27; different interests in the business.

===Relaunched ATCL (2007–2015)===
After the partnership between Air Tanzania and South African Airways (SAA) was officially terminated, the government set aside US$10 million (TZS13 billion) for Air Tanzania to start using its ticket stock (number 197) instead of the stock of SAA (number 083), changing revenue systems and fuel services, preparing e-ticketing and accounts systems, using a new trademark, and clearing outstanding debts. President Jakaya Kikwete appointed Mustafa Nyang&#x27;anyi, a veteran politician and diplomat ambassador, as the board chairman, and former Parastatal Pensions Fund director general David Mattaka as managing director and chief executive officer.

In conjunction, the government also began to look for another private partner to run the airline. The first discussions began with China Sonangol International Limited in 2007, however, the discussions were ultimately unsuccessful and ended in 2010. From 1 July 2007, ATCL started using its own ticket stock and began operations as a wholly owned government airline.

The Parliamentary Committee on Economic Infrastructure expressed its concern about no funds being set aside for ATCL. According to the opposition, the airline has debts amounting to US$4 million due to SAA.
==== Rebranding ====
Air Tanzania was relaunched in September 2007 with two leased Boeing 737-200s in its fleet. The new brand represented the company&#x27;s name, Mount Kilimanjaro and the airline&#x27;s international destinations. The introduction of the airline&#x27;s new logo on a leased Airbus A320 bore the image of the imposing giraffe – Tanzania&#x27;s national icon, to replace the South African Airways flag symbol. On 1 October 2007, the revamped Air Tanzania made its inaugural flight on the Dar es Salaam to Mwanza via Kilimanjaro route.

In February 2008, the carrier acquired two de Havilland Canada Dash DHC 8-Q311s. In December 2008, the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) withdrew Air Tanzania&#x27;s Air Operator Certificate because the airline had failed to meet the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Two weeks later, the International Air Transport Association banned the air carrier from all aviation transactions and informed all travel agencies and other aviation companies to stop all transactions with Air Tanzania until further notice. The certificate was restored in January 2009, with both the TCAA and Air Tanzania claiming there had never been any doubt about the airworthiness of its aircraft. In 2009, Air Tanzania flew 60,018 passengers, while local competitors Precision Air moved 583,000 passengers and Coastal Aviation 141,995 passengers.

Once the talks with China Sonangol International Limited fell through, press reports in July 2010 indicated that Air Tanzania was in serious discussions with Air Zimbabwe to establish extensive and substantive management collaborative arrangements. Both airlines were reported to be in search of strategic partners to shore up their operations, which had been in decline over the past decade.

==== Decline ====
From 2011 to 2015, the airline was in a constant period of decline, shutting down operations multiple times due to lack of aircraft. Air Tanzania was effectively grounded in March 2011, after its sole remaining operational aircraft, a Bombardier Q300, was sent to South Africa for heavy maintenance, leaving the carrier stranded due to its failure to secure suitable aircraft leases for the duration. At the time, the other Bombardier Q300 was undergoing a heavy C-check at ATCL&#x27;s hangar in Dar es Salam, stranded there due to lack of funds to import spare parts from abroad. Air Tanzania resumed flying in November 2011 following the return of the aircraft. The maintenance cost US$1 million, but other accumulated expenses brought the total bill to $3 million, which the Tanzanian government paid in September 2011.

In November 2011, Air Tanzania leased a Fokker F28 aircraft from JetLink Express on a standby basis in case its only operational aircraft were incapacitated. The airline assured the public that it would never cease operations again and that more aircraft would be procured over the next several months and years, according to the airline business plan shared with the media. On 21 November 2011, Air Tanzania began negotiations with Export Development Canada (EDC) to explore how EDC could assist the airline in acquiring more aircraft from Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft manufacturer. Those negotiations, however, failed due to the airline&#x27;s large amount of debt.
On 29 March 2012, Aerovista leased a Boeing 737-500 to Air Tanzania to enhance the airline&#x27;s service delivery in the short term. In early August 2012, Air Tanzania suspended the contract with Aerovista and returned the aircraft. The only other aircraft in the fleet, a Bombardier Q300, was stored for maintenance, which caused the airline to suspend operations and rebook passengers to other carriers. Air Tanzania returned to the skies on 12 October 2012 with a 32-year-old Boeing 737-200. The aircraft was leased for three months from Star Air Cargo in South Africa. The 737 arrived in Dar es Salaam on 11 October 2012 in Air Tanzania livery and started operations the following day.

In late 2012, the Controller and Auditor General of Tanzania, Ludovick Utouh, recommended the criminal prosecution of three former managers of ATCL for the 2007 lease of the Airbus A320 from Wallis Trading Company, a Lebanese company. The Auditor General said there was massive misappropriation and mismanagement of the leasing agreement, resulting in accumulated debt of US$41.4 million by October 2012, all of which is guaranteed by the government. The aircraft was in ATCL&#x27;s possession for 48 months, but it spent 41 of those months in France undergoing major maintenance.

Air Tanzania restarted operations in Kigoma on 10 January 2013, using its Bombardier Q300. The airline quickly expanded to domestic routes and even began to fly to Bujumbura, Burundi under new management.

In the airline&#x27;s search for a new partner in January 2013, the chairman of Al Hayat Development and Investment Company (AHDIC), Sheikh Salim Al-Harthyan, announced plans for an Omani investment corporation to invest US$100 million in Air Tanzania. The money would be used to build an airline training centre and offices for Air Tanzania, buy aircraft, and engage in other development activities that would begin before the end of 2013. In August 2013, AHDIC promised to provide four Embraer 175 and four Bombardiers to Air Tanzania. The Sheikh also said that the original US$100 million investment would be increased gradually. But in May 2014, the media reported no progress had been made and that AHDIC might not be a real company. Sixteen days later, however, AHDIC reaffirmed its interest in the original deal but this never materalised.

===Revival (2016–present)===

A year into the new government of President John Magufuli, he made the revival of the airline a top priority of his administration. In May 2016, the government announced plans to purchase two aircraft in 2016 and two additional aircraft in 2017. On 15 September 2016, the president appointed Ladislaus Matindi as director general of the Air Tanzania Company Limited.

To protect the government&#x27;s investments from debt collectors, the government, through its Tanzania Government Flight Agency (TGFA), took delivery of two Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam and leased the aircraft to Air Tanzania. On 2 December 2016, Bombardier Commercial Aircraft announced that the Tanzanian government, acting through its TGFA, had signed firm purchase agreements for two CS300 jetliners and one Q400 turboprop aircraft for lease to Air Tanzania. The CS300 aircraft are now known as Airbus A220-300 aircraft. The TGFA also ordered two Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft valued at US$224.6 million at list prices.

With the new airplanes, Air Tanzania resumed service to various domestic destinations.

On 2 April 2018, Air Tanzania received its third Q400 aircraft with tail number 5H-TCE. This aircraft had been scheduled to be delivered in August 2017, but the delivery was delayed after being seized by Canadian contractor Sterling following the Tanzanian government&#x27;s unwillingness to settle a US$38.7 million debt awarded to the contractor by the International Court of Arbitration in 2010. By March 2018, the legal situation was brought under control and the seized plane was released. On 8 July 2018, Air Tanzania took delivery of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to be deployed on intercontinental flights.

Air Tanzania received its first Airbus A220-300, registered as 5H-TCH, in December 2018 and second on 11 January 2019 christened &quot;Ngorongoro&quot; and registered as 5H-TCI. The airline became the first African operator of this aircraft type and the fifth airline globally with an A220 family airplane.

In August 2019, one of the Airbus 220s was seized at O R Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg due to unpaid debt owed by the Tanzanian government. The airline subsequently suspended all flights to South Africa, citing safety concerns over xenophobic attacks. The airline continues to be unable to service certain destinations of the fear of the planes being impounded. 

The airline also plans to grow its cargo operations and at the Dubai Airshow 15 November 2021 placed its first order of a Boeing 767-300 Freighter. The total order was valued at more than $726 million at list prices which included a new Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner and two Boeing 737 MAX. The airline began its first dedicated cargo flight to Guangzhou Airport in mid 2021 as passenger service was delayed due to COVID-19 restrictions in mainland China.
====EU ban====
On December 13, 2024, the European Union (EU) banned Air Tanzania fleet from entering the European Union due to safety concerns. 

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership===
Air Tanzania is wholly owned by the Government of Tanzania. As of 30 June 2011, its share capital was about TSh.13.4 billion/=. The board of directors comprises government appointees and has been criticized for having &quot;not a single member with experience in aviation matters&quot;.

===Business trends===
Financial and other figures for Air Tanzania are not formally published regularly. Based on various press reports, government documents and statements by officials, recent trends are:
A 2021 government report by the Auditor General warned of the company&#x27;s huge debts. Air Tanzania flights flying abroad ran the risk of being impounded due to huge debts incurred by the company. Despite the warnings, the government of Tanzania continued to finance the airline and announced its biggest bailout of US$194 million for the airline.

In April 2022, the CAG also raised warning flags about the proper maintenance of Air Tanzania&#x27;s fleet, citing outstanding maintenance debts of TSh.74.09 billion/= (US$31.9 million) for 2019/20 and 2020/21.

==Destinations==
As of December 2024, Air Tanzania serves twelve international destinations including regional routes, Dubai, Guangzhou and Mumbai. Air Tanzania also serves thirteen domestic destinations from its hub at Dar es Salaam&#x27;s Julius Nyerere International Airport.

<text>The EuroLeague, officially the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague, is a European men&#x27;s professional basketball club competition. The league is widely recognised as the top-tier men&#x27;s league in Europe. The league consists of 18 teams, of which 16 are given long-term licences and wild cards, making the league a semi-closed league. The league was first organized by FIBA in 1958, subsequently by ULEB in 2000 and then solely the Euroleague Basketball.

The competition was introduced in 1958 as the FIBA European Champions Cup (renamed the FIBA EuroLeague in 1996), which operated under FIBA&#x27;s umbrella until Euroleague Basketball was created for the 2000–01 season. The FIBA European Champions Cup and the EuroLeague are considered to be the same competition, with the change of name being simply a re-branding.

The EuroLeague is one of the most popular indoor sports leagues in the world, with an average attendance of 10,383 for league matches in the 2023–24 season. This was the fifth-highest of any professional indoor sports league in the world (the highest outside the United States), and the second-highest of any professional basketball league in the world, only behind the National Basketball Association (NBA).

The EuroLeague title has been won by 22 clubs, 14 of which have won it more than once. The most successful club in the competition is Real Madrid, with eleven titles.

==History==
The FIBA European Champions Cup was originally established by FIBA and it operated from 1958 until the summer of 2000, concluding with the 1999–00 season. Euroleague Basketball was created after the end of the FIBA European Champions Cup.

FIBA had previously used the flying pigeon name for the competition since 1996 but had never trademarked the name. As FIBA had no legal recourse on the usage of the name, it started a new league named the FIBA SuproLeague. The following 2000–2001 season started with two top European professional club basketball competitions: FIBA SuproLeague (renamed from FIBA EuroLeague) and Euroleague.

Top clubs were split between the two leagues: Panathinaikos, Maccabi Tel Aviv, CSKA Moscow and Efes Pilsen stayed with FIBA, while Olympiacos, Kinder Bologna, Real Madrid Teka, FC Barcelona, Paf Wennington Bologna, Žalgiris Kaunas, Benetton Treviso, AEK and Tau Cerámica joined Euroleague Basketball.

In May 2001, Europe had two continental champions, Maccabi of the FIBA SuproLeague and Kinder Bologna of the Euroleague. Both organizations realized the need to come up with a unified competition and Euroleague Basketball negotiated terms and dictated proceedings which FIBA agreed to their terms. As a result, European club competition was fully integrated under Euroleague Basketball&#x27;s umbrella and teams that competed in the FIBA SuproLeague during the 2000–01 season joined it as well.

The authority in European professional basketball was divided over club-country lines. FIBA stayed in charge of national team competitions (like the FIBA EuroBasket, the FIBA World Cup, and the Summer Olympics), while Euroleague Basketball took over the European professional club competitions. From that point on, FIBA&#x27;s Korać Cup and Saporta Cup competitions lasted one more season and then Euroleague Basketball launched the ULEB Cup, now known as the EuroCup.

===League era===
In November 2015, Euroleague Basketball and IMG agreed on a 10-year joint venture. Both Euroleague Basketball and IMG will manage the commercial operation, and the management of all global rights covering both media and marketing. The deal was worth €630 million guaranteed over 10 years, with projected revenues reaching €900 million. Along with the deal the league changed into a true league format, with 16 teams playing each other team in the regular season followed by the playoffs. The A-licensed clubs were assured of participation for the following ten years in the new format.
After the new format of the EuroLeague and FIBA implementing national team windows, a conflict between the two organizations emerged. EuroLeague has been criticised by FIBA as well as several national federations for creating a &#x27;closed league&#x27; and ignoring the principle of meritocracy. In July 2019, EuroLeague announced that from the 2019–20 season there will be no direct access to the league through domestic leagues anymore.

===Title sponsorship===

On 26 July 2010, Turkish Airlines and Euroleague Basketball announced a €15 million strategic agreement to sponsor the top European basketball competition across the globe. According to the agreement, starting with the 2010–11 season, the top European competition would be named Turkish Airlines Euroleague Basketball. Similarly, the EuroLeague Final Four would be named the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague Final Four, whereby the new league title would appear in all media accordingly. This title partnership was set to run for five seasons, with the option of extending it to an additional five. On 23 October 2013, Turkish Airlines and Euroleague Basketball agreed to extend their partnership, up until 2020.

Starting with the 2016–17 season, the EuroLeague is made up of 18 teams, with each playing every other team twice (once at home and once away) in a double round robin league regular season, for a total of 34 games played by each team.

The top eight placed teams at the end of the regular season advance to playoffs, each playing a five-game playoff series against a single opponent. The regular season standings are used to determine which teams play each other, and in each pairing the higher placed team has home-court advantage in the series, playing three of the five games at home. The winners of each of the four playoff series advance to the Final Four, held at a predetermined site. The Final Four features two semi-finals, a third place game, and the championship game, all on the same weekend.

Each team plays a maximum 41 games per season: 34 in the regular season, a maximum of 5 during the playoffs, and 2 in the Final Four.

===Qualification===
Currently (and since the suspension of Russian teams because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine), 12 out of the 18 EuroLeague places are held by licensed clubs that have long-term licenses with Euroleague Basketball, and are members of the Shareholders Executive Board. These twelve licensed clubs are:

The remaining six EuroLeague places are held by associated clubs that have annual licences, of which one has a two-year wild card, three have one-year wild-cards and two are the finalists of the previous season&#x27;s 2nd-tier European competition, the EuroCup. From the 2020–21 season, however, if the better of the two teams from the EuroCup makes it to the playoffs, it keeps the place for the following year.

<doc id="540060" wikidata="Q648432" url="?curid=540060" title="Tilbury">
<text>Tilbury is a port town in the borough of Thurrock, Essex, England. The present town was established as separate settlement in the late 19th century, on land that was mainly part of Chadwell St Mary. It contains a 16th century fort and an ancient cross-river ferry. Tilbury is part of the Port of London with a major deep-water port which contributes to the local economy. Situated 24 miles (38.5 km) east of central London and 23 miles (37 km) southwest of Southend-on-Sea (the nearest city), it is the southernmost point in Essex.

==Etymology==
The name of the present town of Tilbury is derived (by way of the port) from the nearby settlements of East and West Tilbury. The name of these settlements is derived from the Saxon &quot;burgh&quot;, &quot;fortified place&quot;, either belonging to Tila, or perhaps at a lowland place. The 8th century spelling (Bede) was &quot;Tilaburg&quot;, and the spelling in Domesday was &quot;Tilberia&quot;.

==History==
Tilbury&#x27;s history is closely connected with its geographical location (see below). Its counterpart on the south bank of the River Thames, Gravesend, has long been an important communications link, and it was there that a cross-river ferry (see below) was connected, mainly due to the narrowness of the river at this point. In addition, Gravesend and Northfleet (also on the south shore) both became vitally important to shipping on the Thames: the former as the first port of call for foreign shipping bound for London, and the latter as a naval dockyard.

There is archaeological evidence of Roman occupation. At the time, sea-levels had dropped, making the marshes habitable. There may well have been a Roman settlement on the site of what is now Tilbury Docks. In the 12th century the river, which had hitherto consisted of difficult channels with uncharted shoals, was changed by the process of embanking the river and enclosing areas of marsh. This improved the river&#x27;s flow, and also resulted in improved land resources on the marsh. It was nevertheless an unhealthy place in which to live; Daniel Defoe, who, in 1696, operated a tile and brick factory in the Tilbury marshes and lived in a nearby house, wrote about &quot;the Essex ague&quot;.

In 1588 Queen Elizabeth I came ashore here to review her main army at the nearby village of West Tilbury (see Speech to the Troops at Tilbury).

In 1852 an Act of Parliament had authorised the building of the London Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR), with a short spur to take advantage of the ferry over the Thames; a pier nearby was constructed for the steamboat traffic. The station was originally named &quot;Tilbury Fort&quot; and opened in 1854. The station was renamed &quot;Tilbury Riverside railway station&quot; in 1936.

A few houses were built for the railway workers, but it was not until the construction of Tilbury Docks (see below) that there was any settlement worthy of a name. Whilst the docks were being built, the thousands of workers were either provided with temporary accommodation or had to commute from surrounding villages and towns. As a result of overcrowding, more permanent housing was built once the docks were completed, including tenement blocks; but these were poorly constructed, and until the formation of Tilbury District Council (see below) the town was in a poor state, as it largely remained until 1918, when government funds were available to better the situation.

===Tilbury Ferry===

Tilbury–Gravesend Ferry has operated from very early times. A sketch-map of 1571 shows evidence of two jetties, the one on the north bank leading to a northward road crossing the marsh. There are also houses marked on the marsh itself, which became important for sheep grazing; and there is some evidence to suggest that the ferry was used for the cross-river transport of animals and wool. Although the 17th century drawing might suggest a boat too small for large consignments, the long-established Gravesend market encouraged such traffic, and a contemporary account suggests that one of the boats used was a hoy, a forerunner of the Thames sailing barge.

===Tilbury Fort===

The curve and narrowness of the river here made it a suitable place to construct forts for the defence of London against foreign invaders. The first permanent fort at Tilbury was a D-shaped blockhouse built in 1539 by Henry VIII and initially called the &quot;Thermitage Bulwark&quot;, because it was on the site of a hermitage dissolved in 1536. The Tilbury blockhouse was designed to cross-fire with a similar structure at New Tavern, Gravesend. During the Armada campaign (1588), the fort was reinforced with earthworks and a palisade, and a boom of chains, ships&#x27; masts and cables was stretched across the Thames to Gravesend, anchored by lighters. The fort was rebuilt under Charles I and is now owned by English Heritage.

==Governance==
Until 1903, the marshland area was part of the traditional parish and civil parish of Chadwell St Mary, which reached south to the River Thames. The parish of Tilbury Docks was established in 1903 and the Tilbury Urban District Council (UDC) in 1912; it merged with Thurrock UDC in 1936. This in turn became a borough in 1984 and then the Thurrock Unitary Authority in 1998. There are two wards covering the town, each served by two councillors: Tilbury Riverside and Thurrock Park for the southern part and Tilbury St Chad&#x27;s in the north. As of May 2016 there are 3 Labour and 1 UKIP councillors. The Member of Parliament for Thurrock is Jackie Doyle-Price.

==Geography==
Tilbury is on the north bank of the River Thames, where the river&#x27;s meander has caused it to narrow to approximately in width. The area to the north is one-time marshlands; to the north of that there is higher ground, where lie the villages of Chadwell St Mary, West and East Tilbury. The town lies to the north of the London-Southend railway line. Tilbury is located east of the capital of England, London

The major landmarks are the docks, the cruise-ship landing stage, and the Tilbury Power Station. There are two churches in Tilbury: St John&#x27;s (Church of England) and Our Lady Star of the Sea (Roman Catholic); there is also a Convent of Mercy. There is, in addition, a synagogue in Dock Road. The educational institutions in Tilbury include primary education, which are Lansdowne Primary School, St Mary&#x27;s RC Primary School and Tilbury Manor Primary School renamed Tilbury Pioneer Academy when the school was taken over by the Gateway Learning Community, a local collective of several schools in the local area. The last serve Infant and Nursery, as well as Junior children. Lying just outside the town is the Gateway Academy, the main secondary school for Tilbury, Chadwell St Mary and the eastern parts of Grays, as well as the adjoining Gateway Primary Free School. Additionally, USP College (Palmers Campus) lies in east Grays near Tilbury.

==Transport and industry==
The Port of Tilbury handles a variety of bulk cargo, timber, cars and container traffic and remains, along with Southampton and Felixstowe, one of Britain&#x27;s three major container ports. It is the main UK port for importing paper, including newsprint. The one-time passenger landing stage was reopened by the Port of Tilbury group as the London Cruise Terminal, though it is no longer served by the railway.

Until the introduction of standardised containers, the majority of the town&#x27;s inhabitants were employed in the docks. The resulting loss of jobs has never been made up. So Tilbury today has high unemployment, and education and employment prospects are widely perceived as poor.

Thurrock Council, together with Kent County Council, subsidises the ferry between Tilbury and Gravesend, which was operated by Lower Thames &amp; Medway Passenger Boat Company and then by Jetstream Tours. 

Tilbury Town railway station is on the c2c (London, Tilbury and Southend line), providing services to London Fenchurch Street and Southend. Tilbury Riverside railway station was closed on 29 November 1992, although the railway still serves the nearby container depot.

Local buses are operated by Ensignbus

National Cycle Route 13 from London to Norfolk passes through the town.

==People and culture==
The Tilbury Band, dating from 1919, was among the leading brass bands in the UK.

Notable people who have had some connection with Tilbury include: football players, John Evans (1929–2004), and Tom Scannell (1925–1994); Noel Betowski, artist, was born there in 1952; Thomas Horrocks Openshaw (1856–1929), a consultant surgeon at Tilbury Hospital; and actor Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje whose being raised there by foster parents is documented in the movie Farming.

In the 2014 BBC series &quot;The Honourable Woman&quot;, the title character Nessa Stein is made Baroness of Tilbury in the first episode.

Tilbury and its environs have been used in some television episodes. Tilbury Fort was used as a location for &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Regiment&quot;, starring Sean Bean.

== Healthcare ==
Until 1896 Tilbury had no hospital. In 1894 the Philanthropist John Passmore Edwards, M.P. agreed to fund a new hospital which was named the Passmore Edwards District Cottage Hospital. In 1969 Orsett Hospital took over healthcare provision in the area. 

==Media==
Local radio station Gateway 97.8, is a community based radio station.

The Thurrock Gazette is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper. 

==Sport and leisure==
Tilbury has a non-League football club Tilbury F.C. who play at Chadfields. Chadfields had previously been a greyhound racing track. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The racing is believed to have been operational in the 1930s and lasted until 1947, when a betting licence had been granted.

A later venue called the Tilbury Stadium on land at the end of Dunlop Road also hosted greyhounds between 1964 and 1967.

<text>Squirrel Hill is a residential neighborhood in the East End of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The city officially divides it into two neighborhoods, Squirrel Hill North and Squirrel Hill South, but it is almost universally treated as a single neighborhood.

==Geography==
Squirrel Hill is located at and has two ZIP codes: 15217 and 15232.

==Surrounding neighborhoods==
Squirrel Hill North has five borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Shadyside to the north, Point Breeze to the east, Squirrel Hill South to the south, Central Oakland to the southwest and North Oakland to the west.

Squirrel Hill South has nine land borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Squirrel Hill North to the north and northwest, Point Breeze to the northeast, Regent Square to the east, Swisshelm Park to the southeast, Glen Hazel and Hazelwood to the south-southwest, Greenfield to the southwest, and South Oakland and Central Oakland to the west. Across the Monongahela River to the south-southeast, Squirrel Hill South runs adjacent to Homestead.

==Demographics==
As of the 2010 Census, Squirrel Hill North has a population of 11,363, having grown 9% since 2000. Squirrel Hill North&#x27;s population is 75% White, 17% Asian, 4% Hispanic, and 3% Black. Of the 3,892 housing units in Squirrel Hill North, 93% are occupied.

Squirrel Hill South has a population of 15,110, up 4% since 2000, of whom 82% are White, 11% are Asian, 3% are Hispanic, and 3% are Black. There are 7,514 housing units which have a 95% occupancy rate.

In 2010, about 40% of Squirrel Hill&#x27;s residents were Jewish. According to a 2002 study by the United Jewish Federation, 33% of the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh lives in Squirrel Hill, and another 14% lives in the surrounding neighborhoods. The report states that: &quot;The stability of Squirrel Hill, a geographic hub of the Jewish community located within the city limits, is unique in North America.&quot;

===Asian/Chinese community===
Per the October 17, 2019 issue of &quot;Pittsburgh Magazine&quot;, the area is also becoming Pittsburgh&#x27;s new Chinatown with an influx of mainland Chinese students from Carnegie Mellon University. The area celebrates Chinese New Year annually with a parade. The area as of 2017 was about 17% Asian.

==History==

===Origins===
The name &quot;Squirrel Hill&quot; may have been given to the area by the Native Americans who lived in its vicinity. The neighborhood most likely was named for the abundance of black squirrels.

The growth and development of Squirrel Hill was initially focused on the riverfront along the Monongahela River. The first recorded house was built in 1760 by a soldier at nearby Fort Pitt, Colonel James Burd, at a place called Summerset on the Monongahela River. Squirrel Hill&#x27;s next house was built by Ambrose Newton some time in the 1760s. This house is still standing and is located in what is now Schenley Park along Overlook Drive (near the ice skating rink). Its first &quot;business district&quot; was the intersection of Brown&#x27;s Hill Road and Beechwood Boulevard.

In 1778, John Turner built his estate of Federal Hill nearby (along what is now Beechwood Boulevard). He later established the Turner cemetery in 1838 inside his estate, which he donated to the local community when he died in 1840. This cemetery holds the remains of many of the original settlers of Squirrel Hill. The Mary S. Brown Memorial Methodist church was also built on adjoining lands donated by Turner. This church was rebuilt several times, but the current building, which dates from 1908, is the oldest standing church in Squirrel Hill.

The third house in Squirrel Hill, Neill Log House, was built by Robert Neill around 1765, also in what is now Schenley Park. This house still exists and is occasionally open to the public. The Neills owned of land in the northern section of Schenley Park. In 1795, the Neills moved from this house to a location in what is now Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh. After they died, the house was handed down to two different people before it was sold to General James O&#x27;Hara. O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s granddaughter, Mary Schenley, gave the property to the city of Pittsburgh in 1889. For a time, the house was rented out by the city to vacationers, but by 1969, the house was in such poor condition that it was dismantled and rebuilt by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation. It still exists and is open for tours during the Vintage Grand Prix in July.

Around 1820, William &quot;Killymoon&quot; Stewart built one of the first tavern/inns in the area. His tavern, located near the intersection of Beechwood and Brown&#x27;s Hill Road, survived for over 100 years. Slowly, Squirrel Hill became a prosperous and affluent suburb.

Around 1840, the Murdoch family started a farm and nursery business in the part of Squirrel Hill North which is known today as Murdoch Farms. Today, this quiet area contains many upscale homes.

By the 1860s, the area along Fifth Avenue near Woodland Road had several mansions, including Willow Cottage. The cottage was built by the industrialist and civic leader Thomas M. Howe, a bank president and member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1851 to 1855. Though neglected for many years and almost torn down, Willow Cottage has recently undergone a $2.2 million restoration and renovation into a Chatham University gatehouse and guesthouse.

====Civil War====
On December 24, 1860, protests broke out in the streets of Squirrel Hill after news arrived that the U.S. Secretary of War, John B. Floyd had ordered 124 cannons to be shipped from Allegheny Arsenal to two forts under construction in Louisiana and Texas. The inhabitants of Pittsburgh predicted that these weapons would be used against them if the South seceded, and this did indeed happen at Fort Sumter.

====Incorporation into Pittsburgh====
Prior to 1868, the Squirrel Hill area was part of Peebles Township. This changed in 1868, when the area was annexed to the city of Pittsburgh.

Following the Civil War, several of Pittsburgh&#x27;s richest families built multiple houses in the Woodland Road area between Fifth and Wilkins Avenues. In 1869, a women&#x27;s college, the predecessor to Chatham University, was established nearby. Today, Chatham University owns several of these large houses.

In 1869, the clubhouse of the Pittsburgh Golf Club was built at the new Schenley Park Golf Course (The present building by Alden and Harlow was constructed in 1900.) In 1876, the Homewood Cemetery was established on of land in Squirrel Hill.

Over the course of the 19th century, the focus of Squirrel Hill shifted from its riverfront at the Monongahela River to the area closest to Oakland and Shadyside. Ebdy&#x27;s orchard was located near Shady Avenue and Murdoch&#x27;s farm, known for its flowers, fruit trees, and vegetable trees was located on the hill above Oakland. By the late 1800s, the building of trolley lines caused a migration of wealthy executives outwards toward country estates and workers inward toward trolley lines. Farms were sold, and divided for new housing developments.

The growth of Squirrel Hill accelerated when an electric trolley was installed in 1893. The trolley line ran via Forbes Avenue and Murray Avenue, terminating in Homestead. The trolley line facilitated the building of hundreds of houses for the middle management of local factories, especially on Shady and Denniston Avenues near Aylesboro. Despite its trolley line, Murray Avenue remained a dirt road until 1920. Murray Avenue carried three Pittsburgh Railways trolley lines (#69 Squirrel Hill, #60 East Liberty-Homestead and #68 Homestead-Duquesne-Kennywood-McKeesport) until 1958 when the trolleys were replaced by buses. Bus routes 61A, 61B, 61C, 61D, 64, 67, and 69 pass through the area today.

Squirrel Hill grew even more with the opening of the Boulevard of the Allies in 1927, providing a direct link to downtown Pittsburgh. By the 1930s, most of the available land in Squirrel Hill had been filled.

In 1953, the Parkway and Squirrel Hill Tunnel were opened. They gave the area easier and quicker access from surrounding neighborhoods.

==Cultural life==
Squirrel Hill&#x27;s business area along Forbes and Murray avenues is referred to as &quot;upstreet&quot; (a contraction of &quot;up the street&quot;) by locals. In addition to the many retail businesses in the neighborhood, there are a number of longtime, non-profit organizations, including a branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh, the Jewish Family &amp; Children&#x27;s Service of Pittsburgh, the Children&#x27;s Institute of Pittsburgh, and the Squirrel Hill Urban Coalition. Many annual events are hosted in Squirrel Hill by various community organizations.

==Parks==

Squirrel Hill contains several nature-related points of interest. They include the Chatham University Arboretum, originally belonging to Andrew Mellon; Schenley Park; and Frick Park.

In 1889, Schenley Park was established on land donated from Mary Schenley, whose grandfather had been the owner of considerable amounts of land in the area. The original size of the park was , though it eventually expanded to over the years.

When Henry Clay Frick died in 1919, he bequeathed of undeveloped land to the City of Pittsburgh for use as a public park. He provided a $2 million trust fund to assist with the maintenance of the park. Frick Park on the eastern border of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood opened in 1927. Between 1919 and 1942, money from the trust fund was used to enlarge the park, increasing its size to almost . In February 2004, Frick Park grew with the addition of the Nine Mile Run stream restoration area which flows to the Monongahela River. The United States Army Corps of Engineers managed the restoration funded with $5 million in federal money and $2.7 million raised by the city. The restoration was completed in 2006.

==Jewish community==

The origins of Squirrel Hill&#x27;s Jewish community dates from the 1920s when Eastern European Jews began to move to the neighborhood in large numbers from Oakland and the Hill District. Many of them took up residence in rows of brick houses on the cross streets of Murray Avenue south of Forbes, such as Darlington Road, Bartlett Street, and Beacon Street. The neighborhood became the center of Jewish culture in the city, with kosher butcher shops, delicatessens, Jewish restaurants, bookstores, and designer boutiques. Several hundred Russian Jewish immigrants moved to the neighborhood in the 1990s.

A 2017 study of the Greater Pittsburgh Jewish community, conducted by researchers at Brandeis University and commissioned by the local Jewish Federation, found that 26% of Pittsburgh-area Jews live in Squirrel Hill, 20% live in the South Hills, 9% live in the North Hills, 31% live in other areas of Pittsburgh, and 14% live in other areas of the region. Although Squirrel Hill remains the traditional center of Jewish life in the region, the study found a shift to more suburban areas. The study also found an increase in the population of Jews who identify as Orthodox or secular, and a decrease in the number of Jews who identify as Conservative and Reform denominations. This feature of Squirrel Hill and surrounding Jewish communities, sustained locations of Jewish life across time and denominations, makes the area unusual compared to Jewish life in other cities. Elsewhere, Jews tended to migrate in waves to suburban areas during the twentieth century, and more geographic separation exists between denominations compared to Pittsburgh.

All of Squirrel Hill, as well as much of the adjoining neighborhoods of Greenfield and Regent Square, is within an eruv, a symbolic enclosure that allows Orthodox Jews to carry items or push a stroller on Shabbat (the Jewish sabbath), during which certain activities are not permitted. Moving items from private domain to a public domain is not permitted on Shabbat, so an &quot;eruv&quot; creates a single, private shared space, and carrying within it is permitted. The irregular boundaries of the &quot;eruv&quot; are such that, as one writer noted, &quot;an Orthodox Jew could carry something within the &quot;eruv&quot;″s boundaries all the way from the north end of the Hot Metal Bridge to the intersection of Wilkins and South Dallas in Point Breeze.&quot;

Squirrel Hill contains three Jewish day schools: two are affiliated with the Chabad and Modern Orthodox movements, respectively, while Community Day School is a co-ed, independent Jewish day school in the neighborhood that attracts families across the wide spectrum of Jewish belief and practice.

===Antisemitic attacks===
On April 17, 1986, Neal Rosenblum, a 24-year-old rabbinical student visiting from Toronto, was shot and killed near his in-laws&#x27; house in Squirrel Hill. A suspect, 45-year-old Steven M. Tielsch, was arrested in 2000 after bragging to a fellow prison inmate that he had killed a Jew. Tielsch&#x27;s first three trials ended in a deadlocked jury; he was convicted of third-degree murder in a fourth trial in 2002. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upheld the decision in 2007.
On October 27, 2018, Robert Bowers entered the Tree of Life – Or L&#x27;Simcha synagogue during Shabbat morning services and opened fire, killing 11 people and injuring six, including four police officers.

==Education==
===Public schools===
The Free Public School Act of 1834 ordered school districts not only to establish free schools but also to establish them in townships outside city limits. This affected Squirrel Hill, since it was part of Peebles Township at the time.

John Turner, who never learned to read or write but became a wealthy landowner, left land and money to the community to build a school when he died in 1844 at the age of 83. It was called Squirrel Hill School and was located on Bigelow Street at Hazelwood Avenue in the Greenfield neighborhood. Its successor closed in 1915 and was replaced by Roosevelt School, named for then-president Theodore Roosevelt. It closed in 1957. It was replaced by John Minadeo Elementary School, named for a ninth-grade school crossing guard who gave his life to save a group of young students in the path of a runaway car near Gladstone School.
After Peebles Township was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1868, Squirrel Hill became the Colfax School District, named for Schuyler Colfax, who was Vice President of the United States under President Ulysses S. Grant. The district had five numbered schools. Colfax No. 1 was located at Phillips Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard. Today, it is Pittsburgh Colfax K-8. Colfax No. 2 was on Beechwood Boulevard near the intersection of Saline Street and Hazelwood Avenue near Browns Hill Road. It closed in 1907 but was reopened in 1916 as the Roosevelt School Annex when Roosevelt became overcrowded. The annex closed in 1939. Colfax No. 3, on Forward Avenue, became Forward Avenue School and was named after Walter Forward, who was appointed U.S. Secretary of the Treasury by President John Tyler. The school was torn down in 1923, but its retaining wall still exists under the Parkway East bridge over Saline Street. Colfax No. 4, at Whipple and Commercial streets, became Swisshelm School and was named for Jane Swisshelm, a writer and abolitionist. Colfax No. 5, at Solway and Wightman streets, became Wightman School and was named for Thomas Wightman, owner of the Thomas Wightman Glass Company. Wightman operated as a school from 1897 to 1980 and since then has been used as a community center building and the home of Carriage House Children&#x27;s Center. The building underwent extensive restoration and remodeling to make it one of only two older buildings in Western Pennsylvania to have LEED Gold certification.

Two other public elementary schools existed in Squirrel Hill. Brown School was built near the Monongahela River in 1888 on land donated by the Brown family. It closed in 1932. H.B. Davis School, named for a principal of the Frick Training School for Teachers, was located on Phillips Avenue. It opened in 1931 and closed in 1980.

Squirrel Hill&#x27;s Taylor Allderdice High School opened in 1927. It was named for the president of the National Tube Company, who was also a member of the Pittsburgh Public Schools Board of Education, which was created in 1911 and given jurisdiction over all the public schools in the city, including those in Squirrel Hill.

===Private schools===
Some private schools located in Squirrel Hill are St. Edmund&#x27;s Academy, a private nonsectarian (formerly Episcopal) elementary school; Community Day School, a co-ed, independent Jewish day school for students ages 3 to grade 8; Hillel Academy of Pittsburgh; and Yeshiva Schools of Pittsburgh. The Day School at the Children&#x27;s Institute of Pittsburgh serves children with a wide range of special needs.

===Higher education===
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and Chatham University are located in Squirrel Hill, although many of CMU&#x27;s buildings are in Oakland. CMU borders Pittsburgh&#x27;s Oakland neighborhood, while Chatham borders Shadyside.

==Local government==
The neighborhood is represented on Pittsburgh City Council by Barb Warwick (District 5, Squirrel Hill South) and Erika Strassburger (District 8, Squirrel Hill North).

<doc id="540073" wikidata="Q1642049" url="?curid=540073" title="Hematochezia">
<text>Hematochezia is a form of blood in stool, in which fresh blood passes through the anus while defecating. It differs from melena, which commonly refers to blood in stool originating from upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The term derives from Greek αἷμα (&quot;blood&quot;) and χέζειν (&quot;to defaecate&quot;). Hematochezia is commonly associated with lower gastrointestinal bleeding, but may also occur from a brisk upper gastrointestinal bleed. The difference between hematochezia and rectorrhagia is that rectal bleeding is not associated with defecation; instead, it is associated with expulsion of fresh bright red blood without stools. The phrase bright red blood per rectum is associated with hematochezia and rectorrhagia.

==Causes==
In adults, most common causes are hemorrhoids and diverticulosis, both of which are relatively benign; however, it can also be caused by colorectal cancer, which is potentially fatal. In a newborn infant, haematochezia may be the result of swallowed maternal blood at the time of delivery, but can also be an initial symptom of necrotizing enterocolitis, a serious condition affecting premature infants. In babies, hematochezia in conjunction with abdominal pain is associated with intussusception. In adolescents and young adults, inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis, is a serious cause of hematochezia that must be considered and excluded.

Hematochezia can be due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, as the blood from such a bleed is usually chemically modified by action of acid and enzymes, it presents more commonly as black &quot;tarry&quot; feces known as melena. Haematochezia from an upper gastrointestinal source is an ominous sign, as it suggests a very significant bleed which is more likely to be life-threatening. Eating beetroot can cause harmless red-colored feces (beeturia) because of insufficient metabolism of a red pigment, and is a differential sign that may be mistaken as hematochezia. Consumption of dragon fruit (pitaya) or blackberries may also cause red or black discoloration of the stool and sometimes the urine (pseudohematuria). This too, is a differential sign that is sometimes mistaken for hematochezia.

In infants, the Apt test can be used to distinguish fetal hemoglobin from maternal blood.

Other common causes of blood in the stool include:
* Colorectal cancer
* Crohn&#x27;s disease
* Ulcerative colitis
* Other types of inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, or ulceration
* Rectal or anal hemorrhoids or anal fissures, particularly if they rupture or are otherwise irritated
* &quot;Shigella&quot; or shiga toxin producing &quot;E. coli&quot; food poisoning
* Necrotizing enterocolitis
* Menstruation
* Dysentery
* Diverticulosis
* Salmonellosis
* Upper gastrointestinal bleeding
* Peptic ulcer disease
* Esophageal varices
* Gastric cancer
* Angiodysplasia
* Intense exercise, especially a high-impact activity like running in hot weather.
* Radiation proctitis

==Diagnosis==
A complete blood count as well as an hemoglobin test should be performed when a patient presents symptoms of hematochezia. A colonoscopy may be necessary if there is suspicion of bleed from colon particularly in the elderly to look for the site and many causes of bleed like carcinoma, ulcerative colitis, rectal varices or other lesions and in certain instances upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may be required as well to look for any rapid and massive fresh bleed from upper gastrointestinal tract when there may not be sufficient time for the change of colour of blood to occur.

<text>Tilbury Fort, also known historically as the Thermitage Bulwark and the West Tilbury Blockhouse, is an artillery fort on the north bank of the River Thames in England. The earliest version of the fort, comprising a small blockhouse with artillery covering the river, was constructed by King Henry VIII to protect London against attack from France as part of his Device programme. It was reinforced during the 1588 Spanish Armada invasion scare, after which it was reinforced with earthwork bastion, and Parliamentary forces used it to help secure the capital during the English Civil War of the 1640s. Following naval raids during the Anglo-Dutch Wars, the fort was enlarged by Sir Bernard de Gomme from 1670 onwards to form a star-shaped defensive work, with angular bastions, water-filled moats and two lines of guns facing onto the river.

In addition to protecting the Thames, in the 18th century Tilbury also began to be used as a transit depot and for storing gunpowder. It continued to be essential for the defence of the capital and a new artillery battery was added in the south-east corner during the Napoleonic Wars. The fort became decreasingly significant as a defensive structure as military technology developed in the 19th century. It was redeveloped to hold heavy artillery after 1868, providing a second line of defence along the river, but further changes in technology meant that it had become obsolete by the end of the century. Instead Tilbury became a strategic depot, forming a logistical hub for storing and moving troops and materiel throughout the First World War. The fort had only a limited role in the Second World War and was demobilised in 1950.

Tilbury Fort is now operated by the charity English Heritage Trust as a tourist attraction, receiving 16,154 visitors in 2014. Many of the more modern military features were demolished during the 1950s, with further restoration work taking place during the 1970s ahead of the site opening to the public in 1983. The 17th-century defences are considered by the historian Paul Pattison to be the &quot;best surviving example of their kind in Britain&quot;, and the fort includes the only surviving early 18th century gunpowder magazines in Britain.

==History==

===16th century===

The first permanent fortification at Tilbury in Essex was built as a consequence of international tensions between England, France and the Holy Roman Empire in the final years of the reign of King Henry VIII. Traditionally the Crown had left coastal defences to the local lords and communities, only taking a modest role in building and maintaining fortifications, and while France and the Empire remained in conflict with one another, maritime raids were common but an actual invasion of England seemed unlikely. Basic defences, based around simple blockhouses and towers, existed in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but in general the fortifications were very limited in scale.

In 1533, Henry broke with Pope Paul III in order to annul the long-standing marriage to his wife, Catherine of Aragon, and remarry. Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, and he took the annulment as a personal insult. This resulted in France and the Empire declaring an alliance against Henry in 1538, and the Pope encouraging the two countries to attack England. An invasion of England appeared certain. In response, Henry issued an order, called a &quot;device&quot;, in 1539, giving instructions for the &quot;defence of the realm in time of invasion&quot; and the construction of forts along the English coastline.

The River Thames was strategically important, as the city of London and the newly constructed royal dockyards of Deptford and Woolwich were vulnerable to seaborne attacks arriving up the estuary, which was a major maritime route, carrying 80 per cent of England&#x27;s exports. At the mouth of the estuary, the Thames narrowed considerably, forming a natural hub for communications: the &quot;Long Ferry&quot; took passengers into the capital, and the &quot;Cross Ferry&quot; moved traffic across the river. This was also the first point that an invasion force would be able to easily disembark along the Thames, as before this point the mudflats along the sides of the estuary would have made landings difficult. Temporary defences had been constructed at Tilbury as early as the 14th and 15th centuries, although little is known about their design.
Under the King&#x27;s new programme of work, the Thames was protected with a mutually reinforcing network of blockhouses at Gravesend, Milton, and Higham on the south side of the river, and West and East Tilbury on the opposite bank. West Tilbury Blockhouse, part of the inner line, was initially called the &quot;Thermitage Bulwark&quot;, because it was on the site of a hermitage dissolved by the King in 1536. It was designed by James Nedeham and Christopher Morice, supported by three overseers; prior to the work, the estimated cost had been given as £211, allowing for stone, timber, 150,000 bricks and of chalk. The D-shaped blockhouse was curved at the front, with two storeys of gun-ports, and probably had additional gun platforms stretching along the river on either side of it; ancillary buildings were placed at the rear and the whole site was protected by a rampart and a ditch, with extensive marshlands and creeks giving additional protection to the east. It was initially commanded by Captain Francis Grant and his deputy, and garrisoned with a porter, two soldiers and four gunners, equipped with up to five artillery pieces including a demi-cannon and sakers.

The invasion threat passed and in 1553 all of the blockhouses were ordered to return their guns; Milton and Higham were demolished. In the summer of 1588, however, there was a fresh threat of invasion by the Spanish Armada. An army was mobilised to protect the mouth of the estuary and emergency improvements to the fortifications at Tilbury Blockhouse were made by Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester. Queen Elizabeth I visited the fort by barge on 8 August 1588 and rode in procession to the nearby army camp, where she gave a speech to the assembled forces. Fears of invasion continued even after the defeat of the Armada, and over the course of the next year the Italian engineer, Federigo Giambelli, reinforced the blockhouse with probably two concentric earthwork ramparts, with ditches and a palisade. A boom was stretched across the river to Gravesend at a cost of £305.

===17th century===

In the early 1600s, England was at peace with France and Spain and as a result the coastal defences received little attention; surveys reported multiple problems with Tilbury Fort including flooding caused by the estuary tides, and ferry passengers and animals making their way uninvited into the fort. In 1642 civil war broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and those of Parliament. Tilbury was controlled by Parliament, who placed the Tilbury and Gravesend forts under the command of a military governor, using them to control traffic entering London and to search for spies; it saw no military action during the war. Tilbury remained in use during the interregnum, having a garrison of three officers and sixty-six men in 1651.

After Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, he began a wide-ranging programme of work on the coastal defences. The Dutch fleet then attacked up the Thames in June 1667, but were deterred from going further for fear of the Tilbury and Gravesend fortifications. In reality, the forts were poorly prepared to resist a Dutch attack; at Tilbury there were only two guns ready for action. The Dutch struck the English fleet at Medway instead, giving enough time for the government to improve the defences along the Thames and mount 80 guns on the forts. In the wake of the conflict, the King instructed his Chief Engineer, a Dutchman called Sir Bernard de Gomme, to develop Tilbury Fort&#x27;s defences further.
De Gomme prepared several plans for the King in 1665; a further iteration of the designs was submitted in 1670 and given royal approval. Work began the same year but it took until 1685 to complete the project. The work was carried out by skilled contractors, who were supplemented by large teams of pressed men brought in from across the region; during 1671, up to 256 workers were employed on the site. Around 3,000 timber piles had to be brought from Norway for the project in 1671 to support the foundations in the marshy ground. The resources needed for the King&#x27;s multiple defence projects became stretched, and one of the planned bastions at Tilbury, originally planned to face the river, was cancelled in 1681, in part to save money. The total cost of the project is unknown, but was significantly more than the original estimate of £47,000.

The result was a large, five-sided, star-shaped fort with four angular bastions, revetted in brick, with an outer curtain of defences, including two moats and a redoubt; two new gatehouses defended the entrance from the north. Two gun lines of gun platforms, facing the river, stretched alongside either the side of the fort. The Henrician blockhouse was incorporated into the defences, but the Elizabethan earthworks were destroyed. The interior of the fort was raised up above the level of the marshes to prevent flooding, and barracks and other buildings were constructed inside. The writer John Evelyn praised the new fort as &quot;a Royal work indeede&quot;. Further work after 1694 replaced the wooden gun platforms alongside the river with more durable stone equivalents.
===18th–19th centuries===

By the start of the 18th century, Tilbury Fort was one of the most powerful in Britain. The number of artillery guns varied; in 1715 there were 17 demi-cannon and 26 culverins mounted on the west gun platform, and 31 demi-cannons and one culverin on the east; the following year there were reported to be 161 guns in total at the fort, although 92 of these were in poor repair and inoperable.
In addition to its role in protecting the Thames, the fort had various military uses during the 18th century. From 1716 onwards, the Board of Ordnance began to use it as a gunpowder depot; there were safety restrictions on moving gunpowder in and out of the London docks, so Tilbury was used instead. Two large magazines were built, able to hold 3,600 barrels of powder each, and the old blockhouse and other buildings were converted to act as further magazines. Eventually the fort could hold more than 19,000 barrels of gunpowder. It was also used as a transit depot for soldiers and, after the Jacobite rising of 1745, as a prison to hold 268 Highlander prisoners of war. The Jacobite prisoners were kept in the gunpowder magazines and 45 died from typhus before they were sent on to London for trial.

The living conditions at the fort were poor. It was surrounded by marshes, with a poor road network, and the garrison had to survive on collected rainwater. A trader called a sutler built a house inside the southern entrance, growing vegetables within the south-west bastion and enjoying an effective monopoly on selling food to the soldiers. New barracks for the officers and enlisted men were rebuilt in 1772, but the officers often preferred to live across the river in the more urban setting of Gravesend, near the military headquarters there. A cricket match in 1776 between men from the Kentish and Essex sides of the Thames reportedly ended in bloodshed when guns were seized from the guardroom; newspapers recounted how an Essex man and a sergeant were shot dead, and a soldier was bayonetted, before both sides fled the scene. It is uncertain how accurate the newspaper account was, although the historians Andrew Saunders and Charles Kightly give it some credence.
During the American Revolutionary War there were fears of a French attack on London. In 1780, the Army carried out a practice attack on the fort with 5,000 soldiers, but there were less than 60 guns left at the fort and many of these were in poor condition. Thomas Hyde Page inspected Tilbury in 1788 and reported that the defences facing the Thames were seriously inadequate. As a consequence, a new battery was built in the south-east corner of the defences, armed with 32-pounders (14.5 kg) pointing down-river, and a new battery, New Tavern Fort, was built along the river to the east. Fears continued during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and smaller batteries were constructed further up the river in 1794. Tilbury continued to be an essential part of the capital&#x27;s defences because of its control of the crossing point on the Thames, and the guns were upgraded with new traversing platforms; the Gravesend Volunteer Artillery was formed to man the forts on both sides of the river. During the invasion scare of 1803, the Royal Trinity House Volunteer Artillery manned ten armed hulks placed across the river as a barrier at Tilbury.

The size of the garrison varied during the first half of the century, but in 1830 the fort had space for 15 officers and 150 enlisted men. Despite the construction of a new range of facilities in 1809, the living conditions of the soldiers remained poor, with four men sharing each of the two-bed rooms in the barracks, and no running water on the site. During the 19th century, a pump was installed to bring water up from a well below the surface. Nationwide investigations into the standard of Army barracks during 1857 led to investment in better facilities at Tilbury; piped water was run into the site in 1877, and improved amenities and sanitation were installed after 1880.
By the 1850s, the advent of steam ships meant that enemy vessels could sail up the Thames far more quickly than before, reducing the time available for forts to intercept them. Rifled guns and turret-mounted weapons and new armour-plating meant that enemy warships could fire on forts such as Tilbury from downstream more easily while being protected from their guns. Fears of a potential invasion by Napoleon III of France led to the establishment Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom in 1859. The Commission reported the following year and recommended that new, more powerful forts be built further downstream, with defences such as Tilbury Fort forming a second-line of defence. Work began on strengthening Tilbury in 1868, under the direction of the then Captain Charles Gordon, focusing on adding heavier gun positions able to fire upstream to support the new forts. The west, north-east and east bastions and the south-east curtain wall were altered to house thirteen rifled muzzle-loading guns, protected by brick walls, earthworks and iron shields. Initially 7-ton, 7-inch (7,112 kg, 17 cm) guns were deployed but these were upgraded to 9-inch (22 cm) weapons by 1888, supported by a heavier 25-ton, 11-inch (25,401 kg, 27 cm) gun. The old Tudor block-house was destroyed to make way for the new guns.

Naval and defensive technology continued to improve over the next few decades, rendering Tilbury Fort&#x27;s bastion design out-moded. The government considered the defences further down the Thames to be sufficient and Tilbury was therefore not improved; it was largely redundant as a defensive fortification by the end of the century, although still in use as a strategic depot. From 1889 onwards it formed a mobilisation centre to support a mobile strike force in the event of an invasion, part of the wider London Defence Scheme, and large storage buildings were built across the site to store materiel.

===20th–21st centuries===

Fresh concerns grew that the Thames might be vulnerable to attack from torpedo boats and armoured cruisers, and in 1903 four quick-firing 12-pounder, 12 cwt (5.4 kg, 50.8 kg) guns were positioned on Tilbury&#x27;s south-east curtain wall, supplemented in 1904 by two 6-inch (15 cm) breech loading guns. In 1905, however, the government decided that the Royal Navy and the forts downstream gave sufficient protection for the capital and removed the artillery, leaving only machine-guns in place.

Tilbury continued to function as a mobilisation store and, after the outbreak of the First World War, it was used to house up to 300 transit soldiers and to supply the new army camps established at Purfleet and Belhus Mansion. It was initially manned by the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers until 1916, and by various reserve units for the rest of the war. The fort itself was used to store munitions while a depot for remounts was built just to the west; a pontoon bridge was built across the Thames for troop movements, guarded by the fort&#x27;s guns. Until 1917, also used to house the headquarters of several infantry battalions. Electric lighting was installed, and a narrow-gauge railway and a steam crane on the quay were added to help to move material in and out of the fort. After the Zeppelin raids of June 1915, anti-aircraft guns and searchlights mounted at the fort and they played a role in the shooting down of the German Navy Zeppelin, &quot;L15&quot;, although it is disputed as to which site in the area fired the shell that brought down the airship.

During the inter-war years, the government concluded that the fort was no longer militarily useful and there were unsuccessful attempts to sell it off for development. During the Second World War, the fort initially housed an improvised anti-aircraft operations room, controlling the defences of the Thames and Medway (North) Gun Zone between 1939 and 1940. Trenches were dug across the surrounding area to prevent an airborne attack. The enlisted barracks and the facilities block, as well as probably the sutler&#x27;s house, were bombed and damaged, being demolished after the war. The fort was transferred out of military use relatively early in the post-war period, and in 1950 the Ministry of Works took over the site. Restoration work took place in the 1970, including the construction of replica wooden bridges. It was opened to the public in 1982.

In the 21st century, the fort is controlled by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 16,154 visitors in 2014. The site is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument, with the officers&#x27; barracks a grade II* listed building.

==Architecture==

Tilbury Fort remains largely unaltered from its reconstruction in the late 17th century under the direction of Sir Bernard de Gomme, with some 19th century additions. It was designed in a predominantly Dutch style, with a ring of outer and inner defences intended to allow the fort to attack hostile warships, while being protected from attack from the land. The heritage agency Historic England describes it as &quot;England&#x27;s most spectacular&quot; example of a late 17th-century fort, and the historian Paul Pattison considers the defences the &quot;best surviving example of their kind in Britain&quot;.

===Outer defences===

The outer defences comprise outer and inner water-filled moats, fed by the Thames and separated by a ring of defensive ramparts. The inner moat is wide but relatively shallow and the banks have been repeatedly strengthened with piles to protect them from erosion. The fort is entered from the north through a triangular defensive work known as a redan, with a redoubt to defend the entrance. A causeway links the redan to the outer defences, which form a complex pattern of ramparts, protecting a covered way stretching around the defensive line. There are bastions on the north-west and north-east corners, and two triangular spurs, originally equipped with cannons, project from the defences on the west and east sides, with assembly points for infantry soldiers on the inside.

A replica wooden bridge runs from the outer defences over the water to an island called a ravelin, which is in turn linked to the inner defences by another replica bridge, protected with two drawbridges. The ravelin formed a physical barrier to incoming artillery fire aimed at the entrance to the inner defences and could also have directed fire against enemy forces that breached the outer defensive line.

On the south side of the outer defences, facing the river, are the West and East Lines of gun positions. These were built in the 18th century and have been subject to considerable erosion and silting; 12 of the original 14 gun positions on the West Line remain but only one of the East Line has survived. In between the lines is a quay, designed to allow the delivery of supplies from the Thames, and the remains of the tracks from the narrow gauge railway built during the First World War. A sluice gate in the south-west corner managed the water in the moats, and allowed them to be drained completely should the surfaces begin to freeze over in winter and provide an advantage to any attackers. To the west of the outer defences is the World&#x27;s End pub, originally the local ferry house, dating from 1788.

===Inner defences===
The inner defences largely follow a pentagonal design, with four defensive bastions positioned around a central parade ground. From the south, the fort is entered through the Water Gate. This two-storeyed gatehouse dates from the late 17th century with a monumental stone facade featuring carved displays of classical and 17th-century weapons; when first built, the now-empty niche at the front probably held a statue of King Charles II. The building originally acted a house for the master gunner. Most of the inside of the fort is taken up by the parade ground, an area covering . The central parade ground was raised to its current height in the 17th and 19th centuries using chalk and dirt, and by the early 20th century much of it was occupied by four large warehouses, since destroyed.
Moving east from the Water Gate, the south-eastern curtain defences and the south-east bastion were rebuilt at the start of the 20th century to hold emplacements for four quick-firing guns and two 6-inch (15 cm) guns, with tunnels linking to an underground magazine. Four artillery pieces, dating from 1898 to 1942, are on display. Facing the parade ground are the officers&#x27; quarters, a terrace of houses probably dating in its current form to the late 18th century, with a stables at the northern end, originally used to hold the commandant&#x27;s horses. It now holds the Bernard Truss collection of military memorabilia. The north-east bastion was redesigned after 1868 and contains an earth-covered magazine, as well as emplacements for 9-inch (22 cm) rifled muzzle loading guns.

On the north side of the parade are two early 18th century magazines, altered in the 19th century. These were specially designed to avoid the use of iron, which might have generated sparks and set off an explosion, instead being built using wood and copper; they are the only remaining examples of their type in Britain. The Landport Gate lies behind the magazines, and has a gatehouse, called the Dead House, above the passageway leading into the interior of the fort. Past the north-west bastion, the soldiers&#x27; barracks would have stood opposite those of the officers&#x27;, but was destroyed after the war and only the foundations of the building remain. The south-west magazine also holds a covered magazine, similar to that in the north-east bastion. Just to the west of the Water Gate is the fort&#x27;s guardhouse and chapel, dating from the late 17th century and one of the oldest surviving places of worship within a British artillery fortress.

<doc id="540083" wikidata="Q1623739" url="?curid=540083" title="Nizari Isma'ilism">
<text>Nizari Isma&#x27;ilism () are the largest segment of the Ismaili Muslims, who are the second-largest branch of Shia Islam after the Twelvers. Nizari teachings emphasise independent reasoning or &quot;ijtihad&quot;; pluralism—the acceptance of racial, ethnic, cultural and inter-religious differences; and social justice. Nizaris, along with Twelvers, adhere to the Jaʽfari school of jurisprudence. The Aga Khan, currently Aga Khan V, is the spiritual leader and Imam of the Nizaris. The global seat of the Ismaili Imamate is in Lisbon, Portugal.

==Early history==
Nizari Isma&#x27;ili history is often traced through the unbroken hereditary chain of guardianship, or &quot;walayah&quot;, beginning with Ali Ibn Abi Talib, whom Shias believe the prophet Muhammad declared his successor as Imam during the latter&#x27;s final pilgrimage to Mecca, and continued in an unbroken chain to the most recent Imam, Shah Rahim Al-Husayni, the Aga Khan.

===Fatimid usurpation, schism, and the flight of the Nizari===
From early in his reign, the Fatimid Caliph-Imam Al-Mustansir Billah had publicly named his elder son Nizar as his heir to be the next Fatimid Caliph-Imam. Dai Hassan-i Sabbah, who had studied and accepted Ismailism in Fatimid Egypt, had been made aware of this fact personally by al-Mustansir. After Al-Mustansir died in 1094, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, the all-powerful Armenian Vizier and Commander of the Armies, wanted to assert, like his father before him, dictatorial rule over the Fatimid State. Al-Afdal engineered a palace coup, placing his brother-in-law, the much younger and dependent Al-Musta&#x27;li, on the Fatimid throne. Al-Afdal claimed that Al-Mustansir had made a deathbed decree in favour of Musta&#x27;li and thus got the Ismaili leaders of the Fatimid Court and Fatimid Dawa in Cairo, the capital city of the Fatimids, to endorse Musta&#x27;li, which they did, realizing that the army was behind the palace coup.

In early 1095, Nizar fled to Alexandria, where he received the people&#x27;s support and where he was accepted as the next Fatimid Caliph-Imam after Al-Mustansir, with gold dinars being minted in Alexandria in Nizar&#x27;s name (one such coin, found in 1994, is in the collection of the Aga Khan Museum). In late 1095, Al-Afdal defeated Nizar&#x27;s Alexandrian army and took Nizar prisoner to Cairo where he had Nizar executed.

After Nizar&#x27;s execution, the Nizari Ismailis and the Musta&#x27;li Ismailis parted ways in a bitterly irreconcilable manner. The schism finally broke the remnants of the Fatimid Empire, and the now-divided Ismailis separated into the Musta&#x27;li following (inhabiting regions of Egypt, Yemen, and western India) and those pledging allegiance to Nizar&#x27;s son Al-Hadi ibn Nizar (living in regions of Iran and Syria). The latter Ismaili following came to be known as &quot;Nizari Ismailism&quot;.

===Origin of the Fidai===
====Assassins====
The Fidai were feared as the Assassins, but did not assassinate for payment. Although they were trained in the art of spying and combat, they also practiced Islamic mysticism at the highest level. This religious ardor turned them into formidable foes, as in the anecdote of Count Henry of Champagne. Returning from Armenia, Henry spoke with Grand Master Rashid ad-Din Sinan (known to the West as &quot;The Old Man of the Mountain&quot;) at one of his castles, al-Kahf, in Syria. Henry pointed out that since his army was bigger by far than Sinan&#x27;s, Sinan should pay him an annual tribute.

Sinan refused, asserting that his army was far stronger, in spirit and unquestioning obedience if not in numbers. He invited Henry to witness this obedience and sacrificial spirit of his Fidai. Sinan signalled to a Fidai standing on the parapet of a high wall of his castle, to jump. The Fidai called out &quot;God is Great&quot; and unhesitatingly took a headlong death dive into the rocks far below. The bewildered Henry asked Sinan the cause for the suicidal jump. Sinan pointed once again to the Fidai who had taken the place of the now dead Fidai. Again Sinan gave a signal to the Fidai to jump and the second Fidai also called out &quot;allah hu akbar&quot; and jumped to his death. Henry was visibly shaken by the experience of witnessing the two Fidais&#x27; total disregard for their own lives. He accepted Sinan&#x27;s terms of peace on a non-tribute-paying basis. The Nizaris thus averted debilitating wars against them because of their Fidais&#x27; feats of self-sacrifice and assassinations of powerful enemy leaders to demonstrate the will and commitment of the community to live free from being a vassal to any Levantine power.

The Fidai were some of the most feared assassins in the then known world. Sinan ordered assassinations against politicians and generals such as the great Kurdish general and founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, Saladin. A sleeping Saladin had a note from Sinan delivered to him by a Fidai planted in his entourage. The note was pinned to his pillow with a dagger, and it informed Saladin that he had been spared this once and should give up his anti-Nizari militancy. A shaken Saladin quickly made a truce with Sinan.

Subsequently, the Fidai aided the Muslim cause against the Christian Crusaders of the Third Crusade which included Richard the Lionheart of England. Saladin, having by now established a friendly relationship with Sinan, the Nizari Fidai themselves joined Saladin&#x27;s forces to defeat the Crusaders in the last great battle between the two forces. Later on, when &quot;the Nizaris faced renewed Frankish hostilities, they received timely assistance from the Ayyubids&quot;.

The Fidais&#x27; apparent lack of fear of personal injury or even death could not be understood by the Crusaders, who propagated the black legends of the so-called Assassins. According to Daftary, these were &quot;fictions ... meant to provide satisfactory explanations for behavior that would otherwise seem strange to the medieval Western mind&quot;. These black legends were then further popularized in the Western world by Marco Polo, the Venetian storyteller who had, in fact, never investigated Sinan, in contradiction to his claim that he had. Polo asserted that Sinan fed hashish to his drugged followers, the so-called &quot;Hashishins&quot; (Assassins), so as to fortify them with the type of courage to commit the assassinations of the most intrepid kind.

This tale of the &quot;Old Man of the Mountain&quot; was assembled by Marco Polo and accepted by Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, a 19th-century Austrian orientalist responsible for much of the spread of this legend. Until the 1930s, Hammer-Purgstall&#x27;s retelling of Marco Polo&#x27;s fiction served as the standard description of the Nizari Ismailis across Europe. &quot;The Russian orientalist Vladimir Alexeyevich Ivanov ... gained access also to Nizari literature preserved in Central Asia, Persia, Afghanistan and elsewhere ... compiled the first detailed catalogue of (Nizari and Fatimid) Ismaili works, citing some 700 separate titles attesting to the hitherto unknown richness and diversity of (Nizari and Fatimid) Ismaili literature and literary traditions&quot;.

===Further schisms===
The Nizari Ismailis have since split from others, initially from the Qarmatians, Druze, Musta&#x27;li Ismailis, Muhammad Shahi Nizari Ismailis, and Satpanthis, the last two splitting from the Nizari branch of Ismailism in the 14th and 15th centuries. Following the death of 28th Imam Shams al-Din Muhammad, the Nizari Isma&#x27;ili split was into two groups: the Mu&#x27;mini Nizari (or, Muhammad-Shahi Nizari) who considered his elder son Ala al-Din Mu&#x27;min Shah to be the next Imam followed by his son Muhammad Shah, and the Qasimi Nizari (or, Qasim-Shahi Nizari) who consider his younger son Qasim Shah to be the next Imam. The final known 40th Imam of the Mu&#x27;mini Nizari, Amir Muhammad al-Baqir ibn Haydar al-Mutahhar disappeared in 1796. The Mu&#x27;mini line has diminished today to a few thousand followers in Syria, while the Qasim-Shahi line has ended up representing most modern Isma&#x27;ilis, and is led today by the Aga Khans.

The Nizaris regard Hassan bin (son of) Ali as a Trustee Imam (imam al-mustawda) as opposed to a Hereditary Imam (imam al-mustaqarr). This fact is clearly demonstrated in the recitation of the Nizari Ismailis’ daily prayers three times a day in which although Hassan bin Ali is revered as part of the Prophet&#x27;s personal family (Ahl al-Bayt), his name is not included in the hereditary lineage from their first Imam, Imam Ali, to their 49th Imam Prince Karim al Hussaini. If Hassan bin Ali&#x27;s name were to be included as one of the Ismaili Imams in their prayer recitation then the present Imam Prince Karim of the Nizari Ismailis would have to be the 50th Imam and not the 49th Imam - the way he has identified himself and is known to the world.

==Contemporary history==
All Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlīs presently accept the Aga Khan as their Imām-i-Zaman (Imam of the Time). Aga Khan IV (Karim al-Hussaini), who was Imām until his death in 2025, was referred to in Persian as &quot;Khudawand&quot; (Lord of the Time), in Arabic as &quot;Maulana&quot; (Master) or &quot;Hāzar Imām&quot; (Present Imam). Karim succeeded his grandfather Aga Khan III (Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah) as Imām in 1957, when he was a twenty-year-old undergraduate at Harvard University. He was referred to as &quot;the Imam of the Atomic Age&quot;. The period following his accession can be characterized as one of rapid political and economic change. Planning of programs and institutions became increasingly difficult due to the rapid changes in the newly emerging post-colonial nations where many of his followers resided. Upon becoming Imām, Karim&#x27;s immediate concern was the preparation of his followers, wherever they lived, for the changes that lay ahead. This rapidly evolving situation called for bold initiatives and new programs to reflect developing national aspirations in the newly independent nations. The current Imām as of 4 February 2025 is Karim&#x27;s son, Aga Khan V (Rahim al-Hussaini).

In view of the importance that Islām places on maintaining a balance between the spiritual well-being of the individual and the quality of his life, the Imām&#x27;s guidance deals with both aspects of the life of his followers. The Aga Khan IV encouraged Ismā&#x27;īlī Muslims settled in the industrialized world to contribute towards the progress of communities in the developing world through various development programs. The Economist noted that Isma&#x27;ili immigrant communities integrated seamlessly as immigrant communities and did better at attaining graduate and post-graduate degrees, &quot;far surpassing their native, Hindu, Sikh, fellow Muslims, and Chinese communities&quot;.

One aspect of the Ismaili community&#x27;s economic prosperity lies an ethos of mutual support and help existing within the community and devotion to the Imam This can result in commercial cooperation and marriages within the community. The present Imam regularly bestows worldly and spiritual guidance to the community.

===Seat of the Ismaili Imamate===
Following an agreement with the government of Portugal in 2015, the Aga Khan IV officially designated the Henrique de Mendonça Palace, located on Rua Marquês de Fronteira in Lisbon, as the &quot;Diwan (seat) of the Ismaili Imamat&quot; () on 11 July 2018.

==Theology==
===God===
Nizari Ismaili theology is the pre-eminent negative or apophatic theology of Islam because it affirms the absolute Oneness of God (&quot;tawhid&quot;) through negating all names, descriptions, conceptions, and limitations from God. The Ismaili theology of tawhid goes back to the teachings of the early Shi‘a Imams, especially Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib (d. 661), Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (d. 743), and Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq (d. 765). Additionally, a number of eminent Ismaili Muslim philosophers — Abu Ya‘qub al-Sjistani (d. 971), Ja‘far ibn Mansur al-Yaman (d. 960), Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani (d. 1021), al-Mu’ayyad al-Din Shirazi (d. 1077), Nasir-i Khusraw (d. 1088), Abd al-Karim al-Shahrastani (d. 1153), Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d. 1273) — consolidated and refined the Ismaili theology of tawhid using the strongest philosophical arguments of their time. Even in the present age, Imam Shah Karim al-Husayni Aga Khan IV, the 49th hereditary Imam of the Shi‘a Ismaili Muslims, continued to stress the absolute and utter transcendence of God. At the 1975 All-Ismailia Paris Conference, the Ismaili Imam endorsed and approved the following resolution concerning the contemporary Ismaili position on the concept of God:

The absolute transcendence of God to be emphasized, and the Ismaili belief in God to be expounded in association with the general stress on the transcendence of God in the Qur’an, as exemplified particularly in the Surat al-Ikhlas.

The Ismaili Concept of tawhid can be summarized as follows:

* God is beyond all names and attributes (including every name and attribute mentioned in the Qur’an, such as the Powerful, the Living, the First, the Last, etc.);
* God is beyond matter, energy, space, time and change;
* God is beyond all human conceptions of the imagination and intellect;
* God is beyond both positive and negative qualities—He is not knowing and not not knowing and He is not powerful and not not powerful;
* God is beyond all philosophical and metaphysical categories—spiritual/material, cause/effect, eternal/temporal, substance/accident, essence/attributes, and existence/essence—God is above existence and non-existence;
* When God is associated with a name or attribute in scripture, ritual or everyday speech, e.g. &quot;God is knowing&quot;, the real meaning of this statement is that God is the source and originator of that power or quality, i.e. God is the originator of all knowledge but He Himself is beyond actually possessing knowledge as an attribute;
* God&#x27;s Creative Act is called His Word or Command—this Command is a single, eternal, and continuous act which continually gives existence to and sustains all created or conditioned realities in every moment of their existence.

The full recognition of tawhid, in a mode beyond human rational discourse, is a spiritual and mystical realization in the human soul and intellect called &quot;ma&#x27;rifah&quot;. In the Ismaili &quot;tariqah&quot; of Islam, the &quot;ma‘rifah&quot; of the &quot;tawhid&quot; of God is attained through the Imam of the Time. The perfect soul of the Imam of the Time always experiences the fullness of the &quot;ma‘rifah&quot; of God and his &quot;murids&quot; reach that recognition through the recognition of the Imam.

===Quran===


Nizaris, like all Muslims, consider the Quran, the central religious text of Islam, to be the word of God. Nizaris employ &quot;tafsir&quot; (the science of Quranic commentary) for &quot;zahir&quot;, or exoteric understanding, and &quot;tawil&quot; (the Quranic poetic metre), for &quot;batin&quot;, or esoteric understanding.

===Rationalism===
For Nizaris, there exists a dialectic between revelation and human reasoning, based on a synergy of Islamic scripture and classical Greek philosophy, in particular Aristotelian reasoning and neoplatonic metaphysics. It seeks to extend an understanding of religion and revelation to identify the outwardly apparent (&quot;zahir&quot;), and also to penetrate to the roots, to retrieve and disclose that which is the inner underlying (&quot;batin&quot;). This process of discovery engages both the intellect (&quot;&#x27;aql&quot;) and the spirit (&quot;ruh&quot;), generating an integral synergy to illuminate and disclose truths (&quot;haqi&#x27;qat&quot;) culminating in &quot;gnosis&quot; (&quot;ma&#x27;rifat&quot;). Parallels have also been noted between the Nizari version of &quot;Imamah&quot; and the Platonic idea of a philosopher king.

=== Eschatology ===
Over the many phases of Nizārī Ismāʿīlī history – pre-Fāṭimid, Fāṭimid, Alamūt, Post-Alamūt, Anjudan, etc., there has never been a single unified view of eschatology. While there are certainly eschatological ideas from the Pre-Fāṭimid period that have been carried unto the present day, particularly those of Abū Ya’qūb al-Sijistānī and his intellectual disciples, each phase has brought in original ideas and renewed those of the past. The academic field of Ismāʿīlī eschatology is one that has been rarely studied in western secondary literature, and the little work that has been done on Ismāʿīlī eschatology primarily surrounds the event of the proclamation of a qiyāmah during the Alamūt period. Otherwise, there have been zero studies published on the eschatologies of pre-Fāṭimid Ismāʿīlī thinkers and post-Alamūt Ismaili thinkers. Furthermore, no work done has been done on the eschatology of the South Asian traditions of Nizārī Ismāʿīlism. The Ismāʿīlīs, like the &quot;falāsifa&quot; (Islamic Neoplatonic-Aristotelian philosophers), have understood resurrection, paradise, and hell through &quot;taʾwīl&quot; (esoteric interpretation) and, thus, have all argued that these are spiritual realities and not physical, material realities. On the rewards of Paradise, al-Sijistānī writes in the &quot;Kitāb al-Yanābīʿ&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;لما كان قصارى الثواب انما هي اللذة ، وكانت اللذة الحسية منقطعة زائلة ، وجب ان تكون التي ينالها المثاب ازلية غير فانية ، باقية غير منقطعة . وليست لذة بسيطة باقية على حالاتها غير لذة العلم . كان من هذا القول وجوب لذه العلم للمثاب  في دار البقاء ، كما قال الله عز وجل : اكلها دائم وظلها تلك عقبى الذين اتقوا

Because the limit of reward is pleasure, and sensual pleasure is ephemeral, and it is necessary that the reward which is obtained be eternal and not ephemeral, everlasting and not discontinuous. And there is no simple, everlasting pleasure except the pleasure of knowledge. From this statement, it necessarily follows that the pleasure of knowledge is the reward in the hereafter, as God, glorified and sublime, said: &quot;Its fruit is everlasting and its shade, that is the destination of those who are righteous&quot; (Qurʾān 13:35)&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

According to al-Sijistānī, the most important piece of knowledge to acquire is the recognition of the one who initiates the resurrection, whom he calls &quot;Ṣāḥib al-Qiyāmah&quot; (Lord of Resurrection). Al-Sijistānī writes in the &quot;Kitāb al-Yanābīʿ&quot;:

فترى الناس على طبقتين : طبقة ممن آمنوا به وصدقوه وانتظروا ظهور، فهم بذلك النور مقتبسون، متنعمون ، مستبشرون . وطبقة ممن كذبوا به وغفلوا عن حده ۲ ، فهم بذلك النور ايضاً متحرقون ، معاقبون

So you will see people divided into two classes: One class consists of those who believe in the Lord of Resurrection, pronounce his Truth, and await his appearance. They are in that Light, acquiring knowledge, blessed, and rejoicing. The other class consists of those who deny him and ignore his rank. They are in the Light also, but are burned and punished&lt;/poem&gt;

Paradise and Hellfire in the Nizārī Ismāʿīlī tradition, are thus, not characterised by material forms, sensual pleasures, and physical burning, rather Paradise is understood to be the presence of knowledge of real truths while Hellfire is understood to be ignorance. The Nizārī Ismāʿīlī philosopher-theologians, as can be seen in the passage quoted above, did not believe that Paradise and Hellfire were &quot;places&quot; that souls inhabit, rather – because the rewards and punishments are spiritual – they are something the soul directly experiences in itself. Al-Sijistānī explicitly says in the passage above that both classes of people are exposed to same the Light (فهم بذلك النور ايضاً), however one class experiences this Light as blessings whilst the other experiences it as burning. These states correspond not to location, but to the level of knowledge in the soul. Additionally, the most famous intellectual disciple of al- Sijistānī – Nāṣir-i Khusraw – writes in the &quot;Shish Fasl&quot;:

[I]t is inevitable that the human soul should return to the Universal Soul. The question only concerns the manner in which it will return...If, however, the return of the individual soul to its source is not in harmony, it will meet with suffering hardships whose painfulness is described by being placed in the midst of fire, the position which will never come to an end

Thus, for Nāṣir-i Khusraw, all souls return to the same spiritual abode but those souls which are ignorant will experience pain, as if &quot;being placed in the midst of fire&quot;. While Nāṣir-i Khusraw suggests here the suffering is eternal, he has in another text – specifically the &quot;Wajh-i Dīn&quot; – indicated that the pains of Hell are temporary and that the Prophet will come on the Day of Resurrection to blow out the fires of Hell and rescue its inhabitants. While both infernalist and universalist positions have existed as legitimate views in the community, annihilationist views have existed as well, specifically being introduced by Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī. Like both al-Sijistānī and Nāṣir-i Khusraw, Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī believed that paradise and hell were spiritual and mental states that the soul experiences and not physical places or sensual pains and desires. While Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī believed that the punishment of ignorant, damned souls was eternal, he believed this eternal punishment took the form of annihilation, i.e. permanent non-existence. He writes:

There is also only one real Hell, and that is eternal punishment, everlasting disappointment and eternal non-existence; the meaning of all this is being outcast from God in every sense of the word

The last most public eschatological view espoused by any Ismāʿīlī was written by the 48th Ismāʿīlī Imām – Sulṭān Muḥammad Shāh Āgā Khān III – who endorses a universalist position in regards to salvation and specifically states in his Memoirs that he prays &quot;that all may be reconciled in Heaven in a final total absolution&quot;. The position of Āgā Khān III can be said to be generally in line with classical Ismāʿīlī views, as well as the views of the &quot;falāsifa&quot; and Sunnī-Sufīs like Ibn ʿArabi (such as in his &quot;Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya&quot;) and those of the Shīʿī ʿIrfān tradition, like Mullā Ṣadra (such as in his &quot;Tafsīr Sūrat al-Fātiḥa&quot;).

==Practices==
===Marriage===
Unlike many other groups, inter-faith marriages are recognized by the community. In addition to the other Abrahamic faiths, the prevalence of Nizari Ismailis of South Asian descent has resulted in growing numbers married to those of Dharmic faiths, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, as well as other Indian religions, such as Sikhism and Zoroastrianism. The Aga Khan IV said that he had no objection to increasingly-common mixed marriages, and met non-Ismaili spouses and children during his various &quot;deedars&quot; throughout the world. In fact, many members of his family, including his daughter Princess Zahra Aga Khan, have married non-Ismailis in inter-faith ceremonies. Child marriages are strictly prohibited. The Aga Khan IV also condemned polygamy, except in certain circumstances.

===Fasting===
Unlike the other branches of Islam, Nizari Isma&#x27;ilis divide the Ramadan fast into two separate, but closely related, kinds: &quot;ẓāhirī ṣawm&quot; (exoteric fasting) and &quot;bāṭinī ṣawm&quot; (esoteric fasting). The former refers to the abstention from food, drink and sensual pleasure. The latter refers to the abstention from communicating the esoteric knowledge of revelation (&quot;tanzīl&quot;) and interpretation (&quot;ta’wīl&quot;) to those who are not ready to receive it.

A third kind of fasting known as &quot;ḥaqīqī ṣawm&quot; (real fasting) is the abstention from anything (in thought, word, or deed) which is contrary to the Command of God. This kind is observed year-round.

==Aga Khan Development Network==
The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) was set up by the Imamate and the Ismaili community as a group of private, non-denominational development agencies that seek to empower communities and individuals, regardless of ethnicity or religious affiliation, and seek to improve living conditions and opportunities within the developing world. It has active working relationships with international organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and the European Union (EU), and private organizations such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Governmental bodies the AKDN works with include the United States Agency for International Development, the Canadian International Development Agency, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Department for International Development, and Germany&#x27;s Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development.
It&#x27;s also known that the Aga Khan Development Network is funded by donations and offerings given by the followers of the Aga Khan.

<text>Don Coppersmith (born 1950) is a cryptographer and mathematician. He was involved in the design of the Data Encryption Standard block cipher at IBM, particularly the design of the S-boxes, strengthening them against differential cryptanalysis.
He also improved the quantum Fourier transform discovered by Peter Shor in the same year (1994). He has also worked on algorithms for computing discrete logarithms, the cryptanalysis of RSA, methods for rapid matrix multiplication (see Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm) and IBM&#x27;s MARS cipher. He is also a co-designer of the SEAL and Scream ciphers.

In 1972, Coppersmith obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a Masters and Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard University in 1975 and 1977 respectively. He was a Putnam Fellow each year from 1968–1971, becoming the first four-time Putnam Fellow in history. In 1998, he started &quot;Ponder This&quot;, an online monthly column on mathematical puzzles and problems. In October 2005, the column was taken over by James Shearer. Around that same time, he left IBM and began working at the IDA Center for Communications Research, Princeton.

In 2002, Coppersmith won the RSA Award for Excellence in Mathematics.

In 2022, Coppersmith was awarded the Levchin Prize for “foundational innovations in cryptanalysis”

<text>The Copenhagen Metro (, ) is a light rapid transit system in Copenhagen, Denmark, serving the municipalities of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, and Tårnby.

The original system opened in October 2002, serving nine stations on two lines: M1 and M2. In 2003 and 2007, the Metro was extended to Vanløse and Copenhagen Airport (Lufthavnen) respectively, adding an additional six plus five stations to the network. In 2019, seventeen stations on a wholly underground circle line, the M3, was added bringing the number of stations to 37. In 2024, the M4 line was extended to København Syd, with 5 additional stations in Sydhavn. M5 is set to open in 2035.

The driverless light metro supplements the larger S-train rapid transit system, and is integrated with local DSB and regional (Øresundståg) trains and municipal Movia buses. Through the city centre and west to Vanløse, M1 and M2 share a common line. To the southeast, the system serves Amager, with the M1 running through the new neighborhood of Ørestad, and the M2 serving the eastern neighborhoods and Copenhagen Airport. The M3 is a circle line connecting Copenhagen Central Station with Vesterbro, Frederiksberg, Nørrebro, Østerbro and Indre By districts. The metro has 44 stations, 30 of which are underground. Service is provided 24/7, making Copenhagen along with New York City are the only cities in the world to provide 24/7 rapid transit service throughout their city limits.

In 2023, the metro carried 120 million passengers.

==Overview==

The system is owned by &quot;Metroselskabet&quot; (The Metro Company), which is owned by the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, and the Ministry of Transport. The M1 and M2 use 34 trains of the Hitachi Rail Italy Driverless Metro class and stationed at the Control and Maintenance Center at Vestamager. The trains are wide and three cars long; their power output is supplied by a 750-volt third rail. The metro trains were originally planned to be four cars long, but trains were reduced to three cars per set as a savings measure. Platforms are – although shorter than originally planned – built to accommodate trains with four cars, and the automatic doors can be modified accordingly should the need arise.

Operation of the system is subcontracted to a private company. For the history of service, this has been &quot;Metro Service A/S&quot;. Trains run continually, twenty-four hours a day, with the headway varying from two to four minutes in daytime, with longer intervals (up to twenty minutes) during the night.
Planning of the Metro started in 1992 as part of the redevelopment plans for Ørestad with construction starting in 1996, and stage 1, from Nørreport to Vestamager and Lergravsparken, opened in 2002. Stage 2, from Nørreport to Vanløse, opened in 2003, followed by stage 3, from Lergravsparken to Lufthavnen, in 2007.

The City Circle Line (Danish: &quot;Cityringen)&quot; is an entirely underground loop through central Copenhagen and Frederiksberg with 17 stops. It does not share any track with the M1 and M2 lines, but intersect them at Kongens Nytorv and Frederiksberg stations. Before the &quot;Cityringen&quot; opened, the Metro expected that it would cause its ridership should almost double from its 2016 levels to 116 million annual passengers.

A fourth line, M4, will be developed into a separate line between 2020 and 2022, as extensions of the &quot;Cityringen&quot; to Nordhavn and Sydhavn open. The two-stop -long line to Nordhavn opened in March 2020. The extension adds an interchange with Nordhavn S-train station. The five-stop, , extension to Sydhavn opened in 2024. The Sydhavn line will terminate at Copenhagen South Station where it will create a new regional rail transport hub by connecting the metro system to the S-train network, regional trains, and long-distance trains on the current lines and the high speed Copenhagen-Ringsted railway. Once these extensions are complete, Metro expects the daily ridership to triple from its current level of 200,000 riders per weekday to 600,000 riders per weekday in 2030.

==History==

===Background===

The planning of the metro was spurred by the development of the Ørestad area of Copenhagen. The principle of building a rail transit was passed by the Parliament of Denmark on 24 June 1992, with the &quot;Ørestad Act&quot;. The responsibility for developing the area, as well as building and operating the metro, was given to the Ørestad Development Corporation, a joint venture between Copenhagen Municipality (45%) and the Ministry of Finance (55%). Initially, three modes were considered: a tramway, a light rail and a rapid transit. In October 1994, the Development Corporation chose a light rapid transit.

The tram solution would have been a street tram, without any major infrastructure investments in the city centre, such as a dedicated right-of-way. Through Ørestad it would have had level crossings, except for a grade-separated crossing with the European Route E20 and the Øresund Line. It would have had a driver and have operated at about a 150-second interval—twice the cycle time of the city&#x27;s traffic lights. Power would have been provided with overhead wires. Stops were to be located about every at street level. The articulated trams would have been about long and have a capacity for 230 passengers.

The light rail model would have used the same approach as the tram in Ørestad, but would instead have run through a tunnel in the city centre. The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger because it would have to accommodate overhead wires. The system would have the same frequency as the tram, but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest passenger capacity, the lowest visual and noise impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest net present value.

The decision to build stage 2, from Nørreport to Vanløse, and stage 3, to the airport, was taken by Parliament on 21 December 1994. Stage 2 involved the establishment of the company Frederiksbergbaneselskabet I/S in February 1995, owned 70% by the Ørestad Development Corporation and 30% by Frederiksberg Municipality. The third stage would be built by Østamagerbaneselskabet I/S, established in September 1995 and owned 55% by the Ørestad Development Corporation and 45% by Copenhagen County. In October 1996, a contract was signed with the Copenhagen Metro Construction Group (COMET) for building the lines (Civil Works), and with Ansaldo STS for delivery of technological systems and trains, and to operate the system the first five years. COMET was a single-purpose consortium composed of Astaldi, Bachy, SAE, Ilbau, NCC Rasmussen &amp; Schiøtz Anlæg and Tarmac Construction.

===Construction of lines M1 and M2===
Construction started in November 1996, with the moving of underground pipes and wires around the station areas. In August 1997, work started at the depot, and in September, COMET started the first mainline work. In October and November, the two tunnel boring machines (TBM), christened Liva and Betty, were delivered. They started boring each barrel of the tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998. The same month, the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro. The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.

The first section of tunnel was completed in September 1998, and the TBMs moved to Havnegade. By December 1998, work had started on the initial nine stations. Plans for M2 were presented to the public in April 1999, with a debate emerging if the proposed elevated solution was the best. In May, the first trains were delivered, and trial runs began at the depot. In December, the tunnels were completed to Strandlodsvej, and the TBMs were moved to Havnegade, where they started to grind towards Frederiksberg. From 1 January 2000, the S-train service from Solbjerg to Vanløse was terminated, and work commenced to rebuild the section to metro. The last section of tunnel was completed in February 2001.

In March 2001, Copenhagen County Council decided to start construction of stage 3. On 6 November 2001, the first train operated through a tunnel section. On 28 November, laying of tracks along stage 1, and stage 2A from Nørreport to Frederiksberg, was completed. An agreement about financing stage 3 was reached on 12 April. By 22 May, the 18 delivered trains had test-run . The section from Nørreport to Lergravsparken and Vestamager was opened on 19 October 2002. Initially, the system had a 12-minute headway on each of the two services. From 3 December this was reduced to 9 minutes, and from 19 December to 6 minutes. Operation of the system was subcontracted to Ansaldo, who again subcontracted it to Metro Service, a subsidiary of Serco. The contract had a duration of five years, with an option for extension for another three.

===Opening of lines M1 and M2===
Trial runs on stage 2A began on 24 February 2003 and opened on 29 May. All changes to bus and train schedules in Copenhagen took place on 25 May, but to allow Queen Margrethe II to open the line, the opening needed to be adapted to her calendar. This caused four days without a bus service along the line. Stage 2B, from Frederiksberg to Vanløse, opened on 12 October.

Forum Station was nominated for the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2005. On 2 December 2005, the final agreement to build the City Circle Line was made between the local and national governments. The price was estimated at 11.5 to 18.3 billion Danish krone (DKK), of which DKK 5.4 billion will be financed though ticket sales, and the remaining from the state and municipalities. In 2006, it was announced that the contract with Ansaldo to operate the metro had been prolonged another three years. However, the subcontract between Ansaldo and Serco Group was not extended, and the contract was instead given to Azienda Trasporti Milanesi in joint venture with Ansaldo; they took over operations from October 2007. The Ørestad Development Corporation was discontinued in 2007, and the ownership of the metro was transferred to Metroselskabet I/S.

In January 2007, the city council decided that a branch was to be built during construction at Nørrebro, to allow a future branch line from the City Circle Line towards Brønshøj. The first part of this line was intended to be constructed at the same time as the City Circle Line, to avoid a multitude-higher construction cost and long interruptions of operations later. This did not involve a final decision, only an option for future construction. The Herlev/Brønshøj line was ultimately dropped as the City of Copenhagen withdrew its share of the cost of the Nørrebro branch chamber in its 2009 budget, and the state refused to continue the project. Any branch to the Herlev / Brønshøj region would now require a shutdown of the City Circle Line for an extended period of time.

In March 2007, a proposal to establish a station at Valby, where the Carlsberg Group is planning an urban redevelopment, was scrapped. The proposal would have increased construction costs by DKK 900 million and was deemed not economical. The increased cost was, in part, due to an extra TBM being needed to complete the project on time. The City Circle Line was passed by parliament on 1 June 2007, with only the Red–Green Alliance voting in disfavor.

The stage 3 opened on 28 September 2007, from Lergravsparken to the airport. It followed, for the most part, the route of the former Amager Line of the Danish State Railways. With this stage complete, the 34 trains were delivered for use by the M1 and M2. However, the line caused a heated debate, with several locals organized themselves into the Amager Metro Group. The group argued that the line should have been built underground, citing concerns that it would create noise pollution and a physical barrier in Amager. In April 2008, the Copenhagen Metro won the award at MetroRail 2008 for the world&#x27;s best metro. The jury noted the system&#x27;s high regularity, safety and passenger satisfaction, as well as the efficient transport to the airport. During 2008, the metro experienced a 16% passenger growth to 44 million passengers per year.

Several parties agreed in September 2008 not to fund a northwest expansion of the metro.

Initially, the system operated trains from 01:00 to 05:00 only on Thursdays to Saturdays, but, starting on 19 March 2009, night service was extended to the rest of the week. This caused a logistical challenge, because Metro Service used the nights for maintenance. The routes were therefore set up in such a way that the system could be operated on only a single track, leaving the other free for work. In May 2009, six companies were pre-qualified to bid for the public service obligation to operate the metro. These were Serco-NedRailways, Ansaldo STS, Arriva, S-Bahn Hamburg, Keolis and DSB Metro—a joint venture between DSB and RATP. The process was delayed because of a procedural error by Metroselskabet, who failed to pre-qualify DSB Metro.

===Construction of lines M3, City Circle line and M4, the Harbour Line===

An expansion of the metro, the City Circle Line, is current and opened on 29 September 2019. Independent of the existing system, it circles the city centre and connects the areas of Østerbro, Nørrebro and Vesterbro to Frederiksberg and Indre By. The line is long and runs entirely in tunnel. The circle has 17 stations, two of which are interchanges with both the M1 and M2 lines, as well with three Copenhagen S-train stations. It takes 25 minutes to complete a full lap in either direction. Archaeological and geological surveys started in 2007, preferred bidders were announced in November 2010 and contracts were signed in 2011. Preparations began by moving utilities etc. in 2010, and construction of work sites and stations began in 2011. Drilling of tunnels began in 2013. On 7 January 2011 the new project called Cityringen started with the signing of new contracts by Metroselskabet, with Ansaldo Breda and Ansaldo Sts (Finmeccanica Group) for the supply of trains and control systems and with an Italian joint-venture led by Salin Construttori (about 60%) and Tecnimont (about 40%) with Seli as third partner for the construction part. In July 2013, Natur- og Miljøklagenævnet, the environmental appeals board, ruled that the city was wrong to grant Metroselskabet permission for 24-hour work days and noise levels of up to 78 db at the Marmorkirken site. This forced construction to stop work at 6PM until a final ruling was made, thus delaying the completion date.

The City Circle Line is serviced by lines M3 and M4. The M3 opened by 29 September 2019, and its trains operate on the entire circle in either direction. The M3 has transfers to M1 and M2 at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv. The line is estimated to carry 240,000 daily passengers, bringing the metro&#x27;s total daily ridership to 460,000.

The M4 was opened on 28 March 2020 when two additional stations were opened in the Nordhavn district. This line running from Copenhagen Central Station (København H) via Østerport to Orientkaj station in Nordhavn, thus sharing six stations with the M3 and featuring two additional Nordhavn stations. The M4 line is interchange with the M1 and M2 at Kongens Nytorv.

An extension to the Sydhavn district open in June 2024, served by the M4. The addition of this line will relocate the M4&#x27;s southern terminus from Copenhagen Central Station to Ny Ellebjerg.

====Evolution of plans====
A northwestern expansion of the City Circle Line was planned, where M4 would have diverted at Nørrebro and run to the suburbs of Brønshøj and Gladsaxe. This project was abandoned, as the interchange chamber between any such line and the City Circle Line was scrapped as part of the City of Copenhagen&#x27;s 2009 budget. In subsequent plans, the northern extension of the M4 was instead relocated as a Nordhavn branch which connects with the City Circle Line at Østerport. The Nordhavn extension with two stations opened on 28 March 2020. The southern extension of the M4 will run from Copenhagen Central Station through Sydhavn to Ny Ellebjerg, where the M4 will link up with the S-train and regional train system. The Danish Transport Authority (Trafikstyrelsen) has suggested converting the F-line of the S-train network to metro standard as an M5 line. If the M5 line becomes reality, it will connect with existing lines at Flintholm Station (interchange with M1 and M2), Nørrebro station (interchange with M3), and the future Ny Ellebjerg station (interchange with M4).

The fourth line, M4 or the Harbour line, shares the track with the M3 between Copenhagen Central Station and Østerport station (six stations shared). 
An additional extension to the M4 is under construction: service the southern (Sydhavn) harbour district in Copenhagen. The completed M4 between Orientkaj and Ny Ellebjerg will feature 13 stations.

The northern extension, Nordhavn station and Orientkaj station, both begun service on 28 March 2020. The southern extension will add five additional stops to the M4, with its southern terminus moving from Copenhagen Central Station to Ny Ellebjerg. This line will service the southern harbour district and is expected to open by 2024.

As of 2019, the M1 and M2 has a total of 22 stations. After opening of the City Circle Line, the metro system is featured 3 lines with a total of 37 stations. Upon completion of both extensions of the M4, the system will feature four lines with 44 stations. 8 of these will be interchanges with the S-train.

=== Future lines discussed ===
Many new lines have been discussed. Initially Line M4 was supposed to supplement the circular M3 on the eastern side of the Inner City between Nørrebro station and Copenhagen Central Station. At this time, an extension was suggested from Nørrebro to the northwestern suburbs with a terminus at Husum station. This was abandoned as the City of Copenhagen rejected funding interchange chamber under Nørrebro station necessary for this extension. Instead, the city preferred the M4 to branch at Østerport station to facilitate development of the Nordhavn harbour area.

The &quot;M5&quot;-label appears to having been reserved for a potential future conversion of Line F of the Copenhagen S-train to metro standard. In 2011, the City of Copenhagen suggested two additional lines M6 and M7, the M6 linking the northwestern suburbs and central Amager and the M7 forming a second ring line further east than the M3, and a western extension of the M1 or M2 to was also suggested. In 2017, the city of Copenhagen suggested a new M6 line connecting Brønshøj and Refshaleøen via Copenhagen Central Station. In 2018, the government and the city agreed on plans to construct an artificial island, Lynetteholmen north of Refshaleøen, and the city included its plans to link Copenhagen Central Station and Refshaleøen in this discussion.

As of January 2018, no further development will be done after the construction of the Harbour line, or Line M4 between Ny Ellebjerg station and Orientkaj in the Nordhavn area, except for a few more stations northeast of Orientkaj.

In September 2011, the city of Copenhagen and neighbouring Malmö in Sweden announced that they were seeking European Union funding to study a potential metro line under the Øresund to the neighbourhood of Malmö Central Station, providing faster trips and additional capacity beyond that of the existing Øresund Bridge. The study, for which the EU granted funding in the following December, will consider both a simple shuttle between the two stations and a continuous line integrated with the local transport networks on each side, and they anticipate a travel time of 15 minutes between the two city centers. Work on the study is expected to continue until 2020.

The planned M5 line towards Refshaleøen and Lynetteholm is supposed to open in 2035. It will encompass 10 stations, of which 5 will be new.

==Route==

The metro consists of four lines, M1, M2, M3 and M4, with a planned M5 line expected to be operational in 2035. M1 and M2 share a common section from Vanløse to Christianshavn, where they split along two lines: M1 follows the Ørestad Line to Vestamager, while M2 follows the Østamager Line to the airport. The metro consists of a total route length of , and 22 stations, 9 of which are on the section shared by both lines. M1 is long and serves 15 stations, while M2 is long and serves 16 stations. About of the lines and 9 stations are in tunnel, located at below ground level. The remaining sections are on embankments, viaducts or at ground level.

The section from Vanløse to Frederiksberg follows the Frederiksberg Line, a former S-train line which runs on an embankment. From Fasanvej station, the line runs underground, and continues this way through the city center. After Christianshavn, the line splits in two. M1 reaches ground level at Islands Brygge, and continues on a viaduct through the Vestamager area. M2 continues in tunnel until after Lergravsparken, where it starts to follow the former Amager Line.

The tunnels consist of two parallel tunnels; that run through stable limestone at about depth, but are elevated slightly at each station. There are emergency exits every , so that no train is ever further than from an exit. The outer tunnel diameter is , while the inner diameter is . The tunnels were excavated by the cut-and-cover method, the New Austrian Tunnelling method and by tunnel boring machines (TBM). Along the elevated sections, the tracks run on alternating sections of separate reinforced concrete viaducts and joint embankments made of reinforced earth.
M3 is a 15.5-kilometre (9.63 mi) looping line which serves 17 stations. Including Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv which also serve M1 and M2. A full trip around the line takes approximately 29 minutes.

The M4 line serves 13 stations, 6 of which are shared with the M3 line. It branches off the M3 line at Østerport in the north and at København H in the south. The southern extension is the newest in the system and opened on 22 June 2024.

==Service==

The system operates 24/7 with a varying headway throughout the day. During rush hour (07:00–10:00 and 15:00–18:00), there is a two-minute headway on the common section and a four-minute headway on the single-service sections. During Thursday through Saturday night (0:00–05:00) on the M1 and M2 lines there is a seven/eight-minute headway on the common section and a fifteen-minute headway on the single-service sections, and other nights it is twenty-minutes on all sections of the metro. At all other times, there is a three-minute headway on the common section and a six-minute on the single-service sections. Travel time from Nørreport to Vestamager on M1 is 14 minutes, to the airport on M2 is 15 minutes, and to Vanløse on M1 and M2 is 9 minutes. During rush hour (07:00–10:00 and 15:00–18:00), on the M3 (Cityringen) there is a three-minute headway.
During Thursday through Saturday night (0:00–05:00) on M3 there is a six-minute headway (one direction), while in the weekend it is twelve-minutes (two directions). At all other times, there is a four/five-minute headway. Travel time of the Cityringen M3 is 29 minutes.
During Thursday through Saturday night (0:00–05:00) on the M4 there is a twelve minute headway between Osterport and Orientkaj stations, while in the weekend it is a ten minute headway between Kobenhavn H Central Station and Orientkaj Station. At all other times, there is a six/ten-minute headway. Travel time of the M4 is 12 minutes (only 3 minutes late night between Osterport and Orientkaj stations). In 2009, the metro transported 50 million passengers, or 137,000 per day; by 2013, the metro&#x27;s ridership increased to 55 million.

The metro operates with a proof-of-payment system, so riders must have a valid ticket before entering the station platforms. The system is divided into zones, and the fare structure is integrated with other public transport in Copenhagen, including the buses managed by Movia, local DSB trains and the S-train. The system lies within four different zones. Ticket machines are available at all stations, where special tickets for dogs and bicycles can also be purchased. A two-zone ticket costs DKK 24, and a three-zone ticket DKK 36, and tickets are good for 60 minutes. Holders of the Copenhagen Card museum pass ride free of charge, as do up to two children under twelve years of age accompanied by an adult. As of 2012, the metro has fully adapted to the national electronic fare card system Rejsekort. Outside the Central zones, the outer zones are divided into sub-zones and ticketing can be a bit confusing for visitors familiar with how zones work in London or Berlin. Passengers must specify, on their ticket which sub-zone they wish to travel to.

The system is integrated with other public transport in Copenhagen. There is transfer to the S-train at Vanløse, Flintholm and Nørreport, to DSB&#x27;s local trains at Nørreport, Ørestad and Lufthavnen, and to Copenhagen Airport at Lufthavnen. There are transfers to Movia bus services at all but four stations.

The system is owned by Metroselskabet, who is also responsible for building the City Circle Line. The company is owned by Copenhagen Municipality (50.0%), the Ministry of Transport (41.7%) and Frederiksberg Municipality (8.3%). Construction and operation is subcontracted through public tenders, while consultants are used for planning. The contract to operate the system was made with Ansaldo STS, who has subcontracted it to Metro Service, a joint venture between them and Azienda Trasporti Milanesi (ATM), the public transport company of the city of Milan, Italy. The company has 285 employees, the majority of whom work as stewards.

==Stations==

There are 37 stations on the network. Of the initial 22 stations on lines M1 and M2, nine are underground and six of these are deep-level. They were all designed by KHR Arkitekter, who created open stations with daylight. Stations have an information column in front, marked with a large &#x27;M&#x27; and featuring information screens. All stations have a vestibule at below ground level, which has ticket and local information, ticket machines and validators. The stations are built with island platforms and are fully accessible for people with disabilities.

The deep-level stations are built as rectangular, open boxes long, wide and deep. The platforms are located below the surface. Access to the surface is reached via escalators and elevators. The design allows the stations to be located below streets and squares, allowing the stations to be built without expropriation. Access to the track is blocked by platform screen doors. The underground stations on M1 and M2 were built as cut-and-cover from the top down (except Christianshavn, which was excavated as a large hole and the station built bottom-up), and the first part of construction was building a water-tight wall on all sides. There are glass pyramids on the roof of the stations permitting daylight to enter. Inside the pyramids, there are prisms reflecting and splitting the light, sometimes resulting in rainbows on the walls. The light in the stations is automatically regulated to make best use of the daylight and maintain a constant level of illumination of the stations at all times.

The elevated stations are built in glass, concrete and steel to minimize their visual impact. Outside, there is parking for bicycles, cars, buses and taxis. Access to the trains are blocked by platform screen doors.

==Trains==

The system uses 64 driverless electric multiple units built by Hitachi Rail Italy and designed by Giugiaro Design of Italy called the Hitachi Rail Italy Driverless Metro.

The trains are long, wide, and weigh . Each train consists of three articulated cars with a total of six automated, wide doors, holding up to 96 seated and 204 standing passengers (300 in total). There are four large &#x27;flex areas&#x27; in each train with folding seats providing space for wheelchairs, strollers and bicycles.

Each car is equipped with two three-phase asynchronous motors, giving each train a power output of . In each car, the two motors are fed by the car&#x27;s own IGBT motor drive. They transform the 750-volt direct current collected from the third rail shoe to the three-phase alternating current used in the motors. The trains&#x27; top speed are , while the average service speed is , with an acceleration and deceleration capacity of along the standard-gauge track.

==Operations==

The entire metro system and the trains are run by a fully automated computer system, located at the two Control and Maintenance Centers, south of Vestamager Station (M1 + M2), and at Sydhavnen (M3 + M4). The automatic train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains&#x27; speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.

The ATO is the autopilot that runs the trains on a predefined schedule, ensures that the trains stop at the station and open the doors. The ATS keeps track of all the components in the network, including the rails and all of the trains in the system, and displays a live schematic at the control center. The ATC is designed so that the ATP is the only safety-critical system, as it would halt the trains if the other systems fail. The safety and signaling specifications are based on the German BOStrab, and controlled by TÜV Rheinland and under supervision of the Public Transport Authority. Other aspects of the system, such as power supply, ventilation, security alarms, cameras and pumps, are controlled by a system called &quot;control, regulating and surveillance&quot;.

=== Vestamager CMC ===

The Control and Maintenance Center is a facility located at the south end of M1. It consists of a storage area for trains not in use, a maintenance area and the control facility. Trains operate automatically through the system, and can also automatically be washed on the exterior. The facility has of track, of which is a test track for use after maintenance. The most common repairs are wheel grinding; more complicated repairs are made by replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer. By having components in reserve, trains can have shorter maintenance time. The depot also has several maintenance trains, including diesel locomotives that are able to retrieve broken down or disabled trains.

At any time, there are four or five people working at the control center: two monitor the ATC system, one monitors passenger information, and one is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, there is always a team of linepeople that can be dispatched to perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards at stations and on most trains that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.

<text>Screentone is a technique for applying textures and shades to drawings, used as an alternative to hatching. In the conventional process, patterns are transferred to paper from preprinted sheets. It is also known by the common brand names Zip-A-Tone (1937, now defunct), Chart-Pak (1949), and Letratone (1966, from Letraset).

A dry transfer screentone sheet, sometimes informally known as a &quot;tone&quot;, consists of a flexible transparent backing, the printed texture, and a wax adhesive layer. The sheet is applied to the paper, adhesive down, and rubbed with a stylus (also called a &quot;burnishing tool&quot;) on the backing side. The backing is then peeled off, leaving the ink adhered to the paper where pressure was applied.

<doc id="540100" wikidata="Q3144956" url="?curid=540100" title="Upper gastrointestinal bleeding">
<text>Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is gastrointestinal bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract, commonly defined as bleeding arising from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Blood may be observed in vomit or in altered form as black stool. Depending on the amount of the blood loss, symptoms may include shock.
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding can be caused by peptic ulcers, gastric erosions, esophageal varices, and rarer causes such as gastric cancer. The initial assessment includes measurement of the blood pressure and heart rate, as well as blood tests to determine the hemoglobin.
Significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding is considered a medical emergency. Fluid replacement, as well as blood transfusion, may be required. Endoscopy is recommended within 24 hours and bleeding can be stopped by various techniques. Proton pump inhibitors are often used. Tranexamic acid may also be useful. Procedures (such as TIPS for variceal bleeding) may be used. Recurrent or refractory bleeding may lead to need for surgery, although this has become uncommon as a result of improved endoscopic and medical treatment.
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding affects around 50 to 150 people per 100,000 a year. It represents over 50% of cases of gastrointestinal bleeding. A 1995 UK study found an estimated mortality risk of 11% in those admitted to hospital for gastrointestinal bleeding.

==Signs and symptoms==
Persons with upper gastrointestinal bleeding often present with hematemesis, coffee ground vomiting, melena, or hematochezia (maroon-coloured stool) if the hemorrhage is severe. The presentation of bleeding depends on the amount and location of hemorrhage. A person with upper gastrointestinal bleeding may also present with complications of anemia, including chest pain, syncope, fatigue and shortness of breath.

The physical examination performed by the physician concentrates on the following things:
* Vital signs, in order to determine the severity of bleeding and the timing of intervention
* Abdominal and rectal examination, in order to determine possible causes of hemorrhage
* Assessment for portal hypertension and stigmata of chronic liver disease in order to determine if the bleeding is from a variceal source.

Laboratory findings include anemia, coagulopathy, and an elevated BUN-to-creatinine ratio.

==Causes==

A number of medications increase the risk of bleeding including NSAIDs and SSRIs. SSRIs double the rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

There are many causes for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Causes are usually anatomically divided into their location in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

People are usually stratified into having either variceal or non-variceal sources of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, as the two have different treatment algorithms and prognosis.

The causes for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage include the following:
* Esophageal causes (gastrorrhagia):
** Esophageal varices
** Esophagitis
** Esophageal cancer
** Esophageal ulcers
** Mallory-Weiss tear
* Gastric causes:
** Gastric ulcer
** Gastric cancer
** Gastritis
** Gastric varices
** Gastric antral vascular ectasia
** Dieulafoy&#x27;s lesions
* Duodenal causes:
** Duodenal ulcer
** Vascular malformation, including aorto-enteric fistulae. Fistulae are usually secondary to prior vascular surgery and usually occur at the proximal anastomosis at the third or fourth portion of the duodenum where it is retroperitoneal and near the aorta.
** Hematobilia, or bleeding from the biliary tree
** Hemosuccus pancreaticus, or bleeding from the pancreatic duct
** Severe superior mesenteric artery syndrome

==Diagnosis==

===Diagnostic testing===
The strongest predictors of an upper gastrointestinal bleed are black stool, age &lt;50 years, and blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio 30 or more. The diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is assumed when hematemesis (vomiting of blood) is observed.

A nasogastric aspirate can help determine the location (source) of bleeding and help understand the best initial diagnostic and treatment plan. Nasogastric aspirate has a sensitivity of 42%, specificity 91%, negative predictive value 64%, positive predictive value 92% and overall accuracy of 66% in differentiating upper gastrointestinal bleeding from bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz. A positive aspirate is more helpful than a negative aspirate (If the aspirate is positive, an upper gastrointestinal bleed is likely; if the aspirate is negative, the source of a gastrointestinal bleed is probably, but not certainly, lower). A smaller study found a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 55%, somewhat opposite results from Witting. The accuracy of the aspirate is improved by using the Gastroccult test.

Determining whether blood is in gastric contents, either vomited or aspirated specimens, may be a challenge when determining the source of the hemorrhage. Slide tests are based on orthotolidine (Hematest reagent tablets and Bili-Labstix) or guaiac (Hemoccult and Gastroccult). There is some evidence that orthotolidine-based tests more sensitive than specific, the Hemoccult test&#x27;s sensitivity reduced by the acidic environment; and the Gastroccult test be the most accurate. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value have been reported as follows:

Holman used simulated gastric specimens and found the Hemoccult test to have significant problems with non-specificity and false-positive results, whereas the Gastroccult test was very accurate.
Holman found that by 120 seconds after the developer was applied, the Hemoccult test was positive on &quot;all&quot; control samples.

A scoring system called the Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score found 16% of people presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleed had Glasgow-Blatchford score of &quot;0&quot;, considered low. Among these people there were no deaths or interventions needed and they were able to be effectively treated in an outpatient setting. 
Score is equal to &quot;0&quot; if the following are all present:
# Hemoglobin level &gt;12.9 g/dL (men) or &gt;11.9 g/dL (women)
# Systolic blood pressure &gt;109 mm Hg
# Pulse &lt;100/minute
# Blood urea nitrogen level &lt;18.2 mg/dL
# No melena or syncope
# No past or present liver disease or heart failure

===Bayesian calculation===
The predictive values cited are based on the prevalences of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the corresponding studies. A clinical calculator can be used to generate predictive values for other prevalences.

== Treatment ==
The initial focus is on resuscitation beginning with airway management and fluid resuscitation using either intravenous fluids and or blood. A number of medications may improve outcomes depending on the source of the bleeding. Proton pump inhibitor medications are often given in the emergent setting before an endoscopy and may reduce the need for an endoscopic haemotstatic treatment. Proton pump inhibitors decrease gastric acid production. There is insufficient evidence to determine if proton pump inhibitors decrease death rates, re-bleeding events, or the need for surgical interventions. After the initial resuscitation has been completed, treatment is instigated to limit the likelihood of re-bleeds and correct any anemia that the bleeding may have caused. Those with a Glasgow Blatchford score less than 2 may not require admission to hospital.

===Peptic ulcers===
Based on evidence from people with other health problems crystalloid and colloids are believed to be equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding. In people with a confirmed peptic ulcer, proton pump inhibitors do not reduce death rates, later bleeding events, or need for surgery. They may decrease signs of bleeding at endoscopy however. In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance. Tranexamic acid might be effective to reduce mortality, but the evidence for this is weak. But the evidence is promising. Somatostatin and octreotide while recommended for variceal bleeding have not been found to be of general use for non-variceal bleeds.

===Variceal bleeding===
For initial fluid replacement colloids or albumin is preferred in people with cirrhosis. Medications typically includes octreotide or if not available vasopressin and nitroglycerin to reduce portal pressures. This is typically in addition to endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy for the varices. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates may be used for the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues then balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varices. This may then be followed by a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.

===Blood products===
If large amounts of pack red blood cells are used additional platelets and fresh frozen plasma should be administered to prevent coagulopathies. Some evidence supports holding off on blood transfusions in those who have a hemoglobin greater than 7 to 8 g/dL and only moderate bleeding. If the INR is greater than 1.5 to 1.8 correction with fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex may decrease mortality.

===Procedures===

Upper endoscopy within 24 hours is the recommended treatment. The benefits versus risks of placing a nasogastric tube in those with upper gastrointestinal bleeding are not well known. Prokinetic agents to empty the stomach such as erythromycin before endoscopy can decrease the amount of blood in the stomach and thus improve the operators view. This erythromycin treatment may lead to a small decrease in the need for a blood transfusion, but the overall balance of how effective erythromycin is compared to potential risks is not clear. Proton pump inhibitors, if they have not been started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found. It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72 hours.
Blood transfusions are not generally recommended to correct anemia, but blood transfusions are recommended if the person is not stable (cardiovascular system instability). Oral iron can be used, but this can lead to problems with compliance, tolerance, darkening stools which may mask evidence of rebleeding and tends to be slow, especially if used in conjunction with proton pump inhibitors. Parenteral Iron is increasingly used in these cases to improve patient outcomes and void blood usage.

==Prognosis==
Depending on its severity, upper gastrointestinal bleeding may carry an estimated mortality risk of 11%. However, survival has improved to about 2 percent, likely as a result of improvements in medical therapy and endoscopic control of bleeding.

==Epidemiology==
About 75% of people presenting to the emergency department with gastrointestinal bleeding have an upper source. The diagnosis is easier when the people have hematemesis. In the absence of hematemesis, 40% to 50% of people in the emergency department with gastrointestinal bleeding have an upper source.

<text>The Russell Group is a self-selected association of twenty-four public research universities in the United Kingdom. The group is headquartered in Cambridge and was established in 1994 to represent its members&#x27; interests, principally to government and Parliament. It was incorporated in 2007. Its members are often perceived as being the UK&#x27;s best universities, but this has been disputed.

 Russell Group members receive over three-quarters of all university research grant and contract income in the United Kingdom. Russell Group members award 60% of all doctorates gained in the United Kingdom. In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, Russell Group universities accounted for 65% of all world-leading (4*) research conducted in the UK, and 91% of the Russell Group&#x27;s research was judged to be world-leading (4*) or internationally excellent (3*). In the 2023 Teaching Excellence and Student Outcomes Framework (TEF), of the 20 English Russell Group universities which were assessed, 7 hold gold awards (35%) and 13 silver (65%). This compares to proportions across 128 higher education institutions of which 29% hold gold, 62% silver, and 9% bronze. Their graduates hold 61% of all UK jobs that require a university degree, despite being only 17% of all higher education graduates.

The Russell Group is named after the location of the first informal meetings of the Group, which took place at the Hotel Russell in Russell Square, London.

==History==
The Russell Group of universities was formed in 1994 by 17 British research universities – Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Imperial College London, Leeds, Liverpool, London School of Economics, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Oxford, Sheffield, Southampton, University College London and Warwick, who originally met at Hotel Russell shortly before meetings of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals (now Universities UK) in nearby Tavistock Square, close to the University of London buildings and, particularly, Senate House. With the exception of Warwick (established in the 1960s), the founder members of the group were all universities or university colleges prior to World War I, including most of Britain&#x27;s ancient universities and &quot;redbrick universities&quot;. In 1998, Cardiff University and King&#x27;s College London joined the group.

In March 2001, the Russell Group decided against selecting a preferred option for the future funding of higher education, stating that endowments, a graduate contribution, increased public funding and top-up fees should all remain options. In December 2005, it was announced that the Russell Group would be appointing its first full-time director-general as a result of a planned expansion of its operations, including commissioning and conducting its own policy research. In November 2006, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast was admitted as the twentieth member of the group. In the same month Wendy Piatt, the then deputy director in the Prime Minister&#x27;s strategy unit, was announced as the group&#x27;s new Director General and chief executive.

In March 2012, it was announced that four universities – Durham, Exeter, Queen Mary University of London; and York – would become members of the Russell Group in August of the same year. All of the new members had previously been members of the 1994 Group of British universities.

In January 2013, it was announced that the Russell Group would establish an academic board to advise the English exams watchdog Ofqual on the content of A-Levels. In 2019, the group launched the website &quot;Informed Choices&quot; to advise school children on which A-level subject choices were useful for various degree courses, replacing an earlier teachers&#x27; guide of the same name from 2011 that had identified a list of &quot;facilitating subjects&#x27;.

==Organisation==

===Objectives===
The Russell Group states that &quot;its aim is to help ensure that our universities have the optimum conditions in which to flourish and continue to make social, economic and cultural impacts through their world-leading research and teaching&quot;.

It works towards this by lobbying the UK government and parliament; commissioning reports and research; creating a forum in which its member institutions can discuss issues of common concern; and identify opportunities for them to work together.

===Leadership===
The Russell Group is led by Chief Executive Tim Bradshaw and chaired by Chris Day, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Newcastle.

==Members==
The Russell Group currently has twenty-four members, of which twenty are from England, two from Scotland, and one from each of Wales and Northern Ireland. Of the English members, five are from Greater London; three from the Yorkshire and the Humber region; two from each of the North East, North West, West Midlands, South West and South East regions; and one from each of the East Midlands and East regions. Four Russell Group members are constituent colleges of the University of London and a fifth London institution, Imperial College London, was part of the University of London until 2007.

The table below gives the members of the group, along with when they joined, their student and staff numbers, and their latest Teaching Excellence Framework overall rating (non-English universities were not assessed).

==Status==
===Research===
In 2022/23, following the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF), the English universities of the Russell Group saw their share of recurring research funding from Research England drop by 2.71 percentage points from the 2021/22 funding (based on the previous 2014 REF) to 68.21 per cent, although most institutions saw a rise in actual funding levels due to an overall increase in funding. The top 19 English institutions in terms of funding continued to all be from the Russell Group, with the top 20 being rounded off, as before, by Lancaster. The LSE was, as in previous REF rounds, the exception, ranking 31st in terms of funding (down from 23rd in 2021/11) and seeing a nine per cent fall (£1.7 million) in its allocation.

In 2015/16, following the 2014 REF, the 19 English universities with HEFCE research funding allocations (excluding transitional funding) in excess of £20 million were all members of the Russell Group. The only English Russell Group institution to receive an allocation below £20 million was the LSE (£18.6 million), which ranked 22nd behind the Universities of Leicester and Lancaster (both on £19 million).

In 2010/11, 19 of the 20 UK universities with the highest income from research grants and contracts were members of the Russell Group. In terms of total research funding allocations from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in 2007/8, the top 15 universities were all Russell Group institutions. LSE was 21st, due to its focus on less costly social sciences research. Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, Cardiff, Glasgow and Edinburgh, were not included in this table, as they are not English institutions. The Russell Group institutions received 82% of the total HEFCE research funding allocation.

The research funding figures depend on factors other than the quality of research, in particular there are variations due to institutional size and subject spread (e.g. science, technology and medicine tend to attract more money).

In 2008, 18 of the then 20 members were positioned in the top 20 of Research Fortnight&#x27;s Research Assessment Exercise &#x27;Power&#x27; Table. The other two places were occupied by Durham University and Queen Mary University of London, which were not then Russell Group members but have since joined. The two Russell Group institutions outside the top 20 were QUB (21st) and the LSE (27th), while the other two universities to have since joined were York (22nd) and Exeter (25th). In the equivalent table for the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, the 24 Russell Group members occupied the top 24 positions, with the University of Lancaster in 25th being the highest-ranked non-Russell Group university.

===Rankings===
In 2023, all eight UK universities in the ARWU top 100, seventeen of the eighteen in the QS top 100 (the other place being occupied by the University of St Andrews), and all ten in the THE top 100 are members of the Russell Group. The Russell Group provides seven of the top ten in the Complete, Guardian, and Times/Sunday Times.

===Selectivity===

All but two of the universities in the Russell Group are part of the Sutton Trust&#x27;s group of 30 highly selective universities, the Sutton 30 (the absent members being Queen Mary University of London and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast). The Sutton 13 group of the 13 most highly selective universities only includes one non-Russell Group member, the University of St Andrews. 

The top 10 by average UCAS points of new undergraduate students in 2021–22 included three non-Russell Group universities: St Andrews (1st: 212 points), Strathclyde (2nd: 210 points), and Aberdeen (joint 10th with Durham: 185 points). The top 10 by lowest offer rate to new undergraduate students in 2024-25 included three non-Russell Group universities: St Andrews (4th; 30.0%), St George&#x27;s (7th; 42.0%) and University of the Arts London (10th; 48.4%). The average offer rate, including conditional and unconditional offers, across &#x27;higher tariff&#x27; UK institutions (as defined by UCAS) was 63.3% in 2024.

===Finances===
The Russell Group accounted for 49.1% of the income of the higher education sector in the UK in 2013–14, having risen from 44.7% of the total in 2001–02. Over the same period the total income of Russell Group universities rose by 69.9% in real terms, compared to a sector average of 54.4%. Russell Group universities are also seen as &quot;particularly creditworthy&quot; due to their membership of the group, allowing them to borrow money at low interest rates.

The total annual income for Russell Group members for 2023/24 was £25.31 billion (2020/21 – £20.30 billion) of which £5.67 billion (2020/21 – £4.77 billion) was from research grants and contracts, with an operating surplus of £6.50 billion (2020/21 – £1.15 billion). Russell Group universities hold a total endowment value of £6.66 billion excluding colleges (2020/21 – £6.18 billion) and net assets of £41.08 billion (2020/21 – £31.52 billion). The table below is a record of each Russell Group member&#x27;s financial data for the 2023/24 financial year.

==Criticisms==
===&#x27;Elite&#x27; status questioned===
In a statement made in 2014 to the Higher Education Policy Institute, David Watson of the University of Oxford suggested that the Russell Group&#x27;s claim to represent 24 &#x27;leading universities&#x27; was &quot;a real stretch&quot;. In the context of the Russell Group&#x27;s reputation in the sector, he continued: &quot;particularly dangerous, I think, is the bottom half of the Russell Group...The problem with the Russell Group is that it represents neither the sector as a whole [nor], in many cases, the best of the sector&quot;. Performance in research intensity showed that there were dozens of other UK universities &quot;above the bottom Russellers&quot;.

A Durham University academic, Vikki Boliver, published a report in 2015 claiming that the prestigious position of the Russell Group was not based on evidence, but rather successful marketing. Only the universities of Oxford and Cambridge were significantly more elite than the majority of &quot;old&quot; universities when a grouping analysis was performed using data on academic selectivity, research activity, teaching quality, socio-economic exclusivity and economic resources. The other 22 members of the Russell Group sit in a second tier of universities along with 17 other &quot;old&quot; universities (Aberdeen, Bath*, Dundee, East Anglia*, Goldsmiths*, Heriot-Watt, Kent, Lancaster*, Leicester*, Loughborough*, Reading*, Royal Holloway*, St Andrews*, SOAS*, Strathclyde, Surrey* and Sussex*), mostly comprising former members of the defunct 1994 Group (shown by asterisks). Another 13 &quot;old&quot; universities and 54 &quot;new&quot; universities made up a third tier, with a fourth tier of 19 &quot;new&quot; universities. Within each tier, the differences between the institutions were less significant than the differences between the tiers. This reflected an earlier result from 2010 that, when the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; universities (defined in the study as Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, LSE, and UCL) were omitted, the remaining (then) members of the Russell Group were outperformed by the (then) members of the 1994 Group.

Ant Bagshaw from the Wonkhe think-tank has criticised the use of Russell Group membership as a proxy for selectivity in official Department for Education reports and statistics, as better measures of selectivity are available from UCAS data. He states that the idea that &quot;Russell Group membership is synonymous with &#x27;best is &quot;persistent, but unverified&quot;. He also notes that this may lead to less scrutiny of the performance of non-Russell Group selective universities with respect to widening participation and improving access.

===Protectionism===

The Institute of Economic Affairs has argued that the Russell Group acts out of protectionist interests. It is claimed that this will &quot;restrict competition, discourage innovation and encourage inefficiency, thereby depriving students of lower prices and/or greater choice&quot;.

=== Sustainability ===
The twenty-four universities in the Russell Group are responsible for around half of the Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions of the UK university sector. The Group as a whole has been criticised for an inconsistent and inadequate response to the need to identify emissions and take reduction measures. An Environmental Sustainability Network was announced by the Russell Group in December 2019; as of November 2021 no outcomes from this had been announced.

===Widening access===
Analysis by the Labour Party in 2018 found that the number of students from disadvantaged areas has only increased by one percentage point since 2010.

In 2015, Durham academic Vikki Bolívar published a paper, &quot;Lies, damned lies, and statistics on widening access to Russell Group universities&quot;, criticising the statistical analysis in the Russell Group publication &quot;Opening Doors&quot;. This had said that &quot;real progress has been made over the last few years&quot; in widening access, but Bolívar highlighted four areas where the statistics used to justify this claim were misleading. She also pointed out that there was &quot;a growing body of statistical research evidence which indicates that one important barrier to widening access at Russell Group universities is that applicants from less advantaged social backgrounds are less likely to be offered places at these universities than comparably qualified applicants from more advantaged social groups&quot; that had not been mentioned in the Russell Group report.
a – difference between the actual offer rate and the offer rate expected if predicted grades and subject choice were the only factors
b – indicates significantly higher (+), significantly lower (-) or no significant difference from expected rate (blank)

<doc id="540110" wikidata="Q974436" url="?curid=540110" title="Magnus Arvedson">
<text>Magnus Karl Olof Arvedson (born 25 November 1971) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey left winger who played 7 seasons in the National Hockey League for the Ottawa Senators and Vancouver Canucks. He also competed in the men&#x27;s tournament at the 2002 Winter Olympics.

==Playing career==
A late bloomer, Arvedson didn&#x27;t become a regular in the Swedish Elite League until 1994 at the age of 23. However, over the next few seasons he became a top performer with Färjestads BK, and was selected to represent Sweden at the 1997 World Championships. Following a strong performance there in helping his team to a silver medal, Arvedson was selected 119th overall in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators.

Arvedson stepped straight into Ottawa&#x27;s lineup in the 1997–98 season, establishing himself as a top-notch defensive forward and finishing the year with 26 points. In 1998–99, he would have the strongest year of his career - promoted to a scoring line, he finished the season with 21 goals and 47 points. He also finished as runner up to Jere Lehtinen in voting for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s top defensive forward, losing a close vote (Lehtinen had 23 1st-place votes to Arvedson&#x27;s 19).

Arvedson continued his strong play over the next two seasons, although he would be hobbled by the injury bug, missing over 30 games both years. However, when healthy his offensive numbers continued to improve, as he recorded 32 goals and 61 points in just 98 games between 1999 and 2001. However, his production (or lack thereof) in the playoffs was starting to become an issue. In 22 career playoff games, he had yet to score a goal and had added a meagre two assists, and took a large portion of the blame for the playoff woes of the Senators, who had been knocked out in the first round three years in a row after excellent regular seasons.

Healthy again in 2001–02, Arvedson registered 12 goals and 39 points, and finished top-10 in Selke voting. He did manage his first two playoff goals, although he was again criticized for his performance as Ottawa was knocked out in the second round by the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 2002–03, he recorded 16 goals and 37 points, but added just a single playoff goal in 18 games as the Senators were knocked out in the conference finals.

Looking to move in a different direction, Ottawa showed limited interest in re-signing Arvedson when he became an unrestricted free agent, and he signed with the Vancouver Canucks for the 2003–04 season. After a slow start, Arvedson caught fire when placed mid-season on a line with Daniel and Henrik Sedin. However, while in the middle of the best goal-scoring streak of his career, six goals in five games, he took a knee-on-knee hit from Bryan Marchment of the Toronto Maple Leafs, ending his season and ultimately his NHL career.

In the summer of 2004, with the 2004 NHL work stoppage impending, he signed with his old club Färjestads BK, for the upcoming year. However, during a pre-season game he injured his back which forced him to retire.

In 434 career NHL games, Arvedson recorded 100 goals and 125 assists for 225 points, along with 241 penalty minutes. He also added 3 goals and 8 assists for 11 points in 52 playoff games.

==Coaching career==
On 30 March 2007 he became the new head coach of the Swedish Elitserien club Mora IK. After Mora IK had played Kvalserien 2008 and lost its Elitserien status, Arvedson became the new head coach of the Swedish HockeyAllsvenskan club Bofors IK on 9 April 2008. He was replaced midseason after his team was at the bottom of the standings.

He coached Sweden&#x27;s Division-2 team, Forshaga IF for the 2011–12 season.

<text>The Moreau River (Lakota: Hiŋháŋ Wakpá) a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately long, in South Dakota in the United States. Moreau River has the name of a pioneer trader.

It rises in two forks in northwestern South Dakota, in the Badlands of Butte and Harding Counties. The North Fork rises approximately northeast of Crow Buttes. The South Fork rises approximately west of the headwaters of the North Fork. The two forks flow ESE and unite near Zeona in southern Perkins County. The combined stream flows east, past Usta, and across the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, past Iron Lightning, Thunder Butte, Green Grass and Whitehorse. It joins the Missouri in Lake Oahe, with the lower of the river forming an arm of the reservoir.

The river generally parallels its neighbor to the north, the Grand River, running from west to east to join the Missouri. Draining the Pierre Hills and Northern Plateaus, the Moreau (formerly Owl River) has a drainage basin of approximately . The Moreau River also has Sand Creek as a source, along with the North and South Forks, and claims several tributaries, such as the Little Moreau, Deep, Red Earth, Antelope, and Thunder Butte Rivers. At Promise, the river averages a flow of .

<text>The bora is a northerly to north-easterly katabatic wind in areas near the Adriatic Sea. Similar nomenclature is used for north-eastern winds in other littoral areas of eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea basins.

==Name==
It is known in Greek as (&quot;mpóra&quot;, pronounced &quot;bora&quot;) and Italian as . In English, the name &quot;bora&quot; is used. The Serbo-Croatian name and Slovene are not etymologically related to &quot;bora&quot;; they derive from Common Slavic &quot;burja&quot; &#x27;storm&#x27; (from the verb &quot;*burĭti&quot;), and the meaning &#x27;bora&#x27; developed later.

The same root as &quot;bora&quot; is found in the name of the Greek mythological figure of Boreas (Βορέας), and the Modern Greek word for the north wind . Historical linguists speculate that the name may derive from a Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;gworhx-&quot; &#x27;mountain&#x27;, which gave rise to Slavic &quot;gora&quot; and Sanskrit &quot;giri-&quot;, both &#x27;mountain&#x27;.

== Features ==
 The changeable bora can often be felt all over Adriatic Croatia, the Montenegrin Littoral, the Slovenian Littoral, Trieste, and the rest of the Adriatic east coast. It blows in gusts. The bora is most common during the winter. It affects coastal areas and it weakens into the open sea.

It blows hardest when a polar high-pressure area sits over the snow-covered mountains of the interior plateau behind the Dinaric coastal mountain range and a calm low-pressure area lies further south over the warmer Adriatic. As the air grows even colder and thus denser at night, the bora increases. Its initial temperature is so low that even with the warming occasioned by its descent it reaches the lowlands as a cold wind.

The wind takes two different traditional names in areas of Italy and Croatia depending on associated meteorological conditions: the &quot;light bora&quot; () is a bora in the presence of anticyclone clear skies, whereas cyclone clouds gathering on the hilltops and moving towards the seaside with rain or snow characterize the &quot;dark bora&quot; (, ).

== Areas affected ==


The area where some of the strongest bora winds occur is the Velebit mountain range in Croatia. This seaside mountain chain, spanning 145 km, represents a huge weather and climatic divide between the sharp continental climate of the interior, characterized by significant day/night temperature differences throughout the year, and the Adriatic coast, with a Mediterranean climate. The bora occurs because these two divided weather systems meet and tend to equalize over the mountain range.

Sailing during the bora can be challenging and it requires caution, regarding readiness of both the boat and its crew. Short, high waves with white crests are its characteristics, making the navigation difficult. The small drops formed by the wind create a so-called &quot;sea smoke&quot; that reduces the visibility significantly. Experienced seamen have a proverb: &quot;When the bora sails, you don&#x27;t!&quot; Sailing can be extremely dangerous for an inexperienced navigator in the Velebit Channel because the wind can start suddenly on a clear and calm day and result in major problems, frequently also affecting road traffic.

Near the towns of Senj, Stara Novalja, Karlobag and the southern portal of the Sveti Rok Tunnel in Croatia, it can reach speeds of up to 220 km/h. On 21 December 1998 the speed of a gust on the Maslenica Bridge (north of Zadar) was measured at a record speed of 69 m/s or 248 km/h. Wind shields were installed on that part of the highway. During 22 to 25 December 2003 on A1 highway near Sveti Rok Tunnel a reading measured the speed of 304 km/h, but this is not considered an official record because the instruments were not calibrated for such speed.

Incidents where the Adriatic Sea becomes covered in ice during a bura storm have been recorded in 1956 in Senj and 1963 in Makarska. The maximum duration of constant intense bura winds has been measured at 67–68 hours in Dalmatia. In February 2012, during the early 2012 European cold wave, the shoreline in Senj froze and snow piled up after a 150 km/h bora plummeted the temperature to −14 °C, with 7 meter-high waves. The bora ripped the trees from the soil and destroyed roofs of houses. On the island of Pag, the Bora threw fish out of the sea. In many Croatian coastal cities, fresh water froze inside the pipes.

The wind is also an integral feature of Slovenia&#x27;s Vipava Valley and, to a lesser extent, the Karst Plateau (known as &quot;Carso&quot; in Italian), an area of limestone heights over the Gulf of Trieste stretching towards the Istrian peninsula. Because the region separates the lower Adriatic coast from the Julian Alps range, extreme bora winds often occur there. They have influenced the region&#x27;s traditional lifestyle and architecture. Towns on the coast, where the bora frequently occurs, are built densely with narrow streets in part because of the wind. Buildings in several towns and villages in Slovenia and the Province of Trieste (Italy) have stones on their roofs to prevent the roof tiles from being blown off. Chains and ropes are occasionally stretched along the sidewalks in downtown Trieste, Italy, to facilitate pedestrian traffic – gusts in the city are usually above 120 km/h reaching to maxima of near 200 km/h. A strong bora will often be reported on Italian television news. Slovenian towns where the strongest bora occurs are Ajdovščina, Vipava and, to a lesser extent, Nova Gorica. In Slovenia, the most affected section is usually the upper part of the Vipava Valley, stretching from Ajdovščina to Podnanos, where the speed of the wind can exceed 200 km/h.

Strong bora winds also occur in the Tsemes Bay of the Black Sea near the Russian port of Novorossiysk, where they are known as &quot;nordost&quot; &#x27;northeastern&#x27;. They can reach speeds of up to 220 km/h.

<text>Arron Miles Asham (born April 13, 1978) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played 15 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). Over his 15 seasons, he played for 6 different teams.

==Playing career==
Asham was drafted 71st overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft and made his NHL debut with Montreal during the 1998–99 season. After parts of four seasons with Montreal, he was traded to the New York Islanders on June 22, 2002, along with a 2002 5th round draft pick for Mariusz Czerkawski. After years of going back and forth between the Canadiens and their American Hockey League affiliate, Asham became a mainstay in the Islanders line-up with his most productive offensive season to date coming during his first season with his new team in 2002–03, when he scored 15 goals and 19 assists for 34 points in 78 games. After four seasons with the Islanders, Asham signed a one-year contract with the New Jersey Devils on August 7, 2007.

After the 2007–08 season, Asham became a free agent again, this time signing a two-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 7, 2008. On signing with the Flyers, Asham said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always loved the way the Flyers play and I fit in here. They play hard every night. They play tough hockey and I&#x27;ve always admired that. I always thought I should play here and when the chance came up last summer to come here, I thought it was the best place for me and a place where I&#x27;d really have a chance to win a Stanley Cup in the next couple of years.&quot;

In the 2010 playoffs, Asham scored four goals as the Flyers defied expectations and reached the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time since 1997. His biggest goal came in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals vs. Montreal when he scored in the 2nd period to give the Flyers a 2–1 lead of an eventual 4–2 victory that eliminated the Canadiens and propelled the Flyers into a Finals matchup against the Chicago Blackhawks. Asham netted one goal in the finals as the Flyers lost to the Blackhawks 4 games to 2.

As a free agent that summer, Asham left the Flyers and signed a one-year contract worth $700,000 with the Pittsburgh Penguins on August 20, 2010. During the following off-season, the contract was extended for another year.

During Game 3 of the 2012 NHL Eastern Conference quarterfinals, in retaliation to a hit on a teammate, Asham cross-checked Brayden Schenn of the Philadelphia Flyers in the upper body, and then threw a punch while Schenn was down on the ice. Schenn sustained no apparent injury due to the hit. For his actions, Asham received a four-game suspension, his first disciplinary action from the NHL Commissioner since joining the NHL.

As a free agent from the Penguins, Asham signed a two-year contract with the New York Rangers on July 1, 2012. With this, Asham had played for all 5 teams in the Atlantic Division during his career. On February 10, 2013, Asham scored his first goal as a Ranger in a 5–1 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning, which made Asham the only player to score a goal with every Atlantic Division team. On May 13, 2013, he scored the series-winning goal in Game 7 of the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs to push the Rangers into the second round and eliminate the Washington Capitals.

Asham saw limited action with the Rangers during the 2013–14 season, playing in only six games. He spent most of the season with the Hartford Wolf Pack. The Rangers did not offer to extend Asham&#x27;s contract and on July 1, 2014, he became an unrestricted free agent, effectively ending his professional career.

In September 2015, Asham signed an amateur playing contract with the Gander Flyers of the Central West Senior Hockey League.

==Personal life==

Asham&#x27;s hometown is Portage La Prairie, where he still has many friends and family. He has 4 children: daughters Azilyn and Oceane, and sons Dexter and Cruz. Asham is Métis.

Asham also has his own charity called &quot;Arron&#x27;s Chance to Play Hockey&quot; (chance2play.com) This foundation&#x27;s mission is to work in partnership with the community to provide opportunities that will enhance the emotional, physical, social and intellectual well-being of children. The overall goal is to enhance the lives of children and families.

<text>Our Lady of Ljeviš (; ) is a 14th-century Serbian Orthodox church in the town of Prizren, in southern Kosovo. Since 2006, the church is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site named Medieval Monuments in Kosovo.

The church was built in the beginning of the 14th century on the orders of Stefan Milutin, King of Serbia, on the site of a former Byzantine church. The rebuilt church featured frescoes by Byzantine painters, Michael and Eutychios Astrapas. After the Ottomans completed its annexation of the region in the 15th century, a minaret was erected and the complex was converted into a mosque. In 1912, when the Serbian army annexed Kosovo, the status of the church was restored. After World War II, under SFR Yugoslavia, it saw extensive restoration and reconstruction and functioned as a museum. The site was heavily damaged during the 2004 unrest in Kosovo and has been going through several phases of restoration since then.

== Name ==
&quot;Bogorodica ljeviška&quot; was the official name in Milutin&#x27;s era although the church was popularly known as the Church of St. Paraskeva. This is the name by which it is known by both Albanians as &quot;Shën Premte&quot; and Serbs as &quot;Sveta Petka&quot;. Consequently, when it became a mosque it was known Cuma Cami (, ), the &quot;Friday Mosque&quot;, although it was officially known as &quot;Fatih Cami&quot;, Mehmed Fatih&#x27;s mosque.

&quot;Ljeviška&quot; (of Ljeviš) is a Serbianized version of the Greek word &quot;Eleusa&quot; (Ελεούσα), meaning &quot;merciful&quot;, a type of depiction of the Virgin Mary in icons in which the infant Jesus Christ is nestled against her cheek.

==History==

The site has been used as a religious and burial site since antiquity. Remains of an altar of the Roman era have been found in the outer walls of the later church. A stone slab which depicts a laurel wreath has also been found within the walls of the church. It may have been part of a public building of the same era in the region of Prizren. These findings are common of medieval times, as parts of older buildings were frequently used as building materials (spolia). They highlight valuable information about the city of Prizren in the Roman period and indicate that it may have been a settlement bigger than a village at that time.

Stefan Milutin, King of Serbia, commissioned its rebuilding and expansion in 1306/7 on the site of a Byzantine basilica of the 11th century. The church was built by master builder Nicholas, according to an inscription in the exonarthex. The previous Byzantine church had three naves to which Milutin added two more. The architecture of the rebuilt church utilized Late Byzantine architecture through the use of five domes, monumental inscriptions in its exterior and the Byzantine belfry. Milutin chose to utilize these elements as a symbol in order to highlight his own partially Byzantine origin and relation to the imperial family. Another aspect of the frescoes of Bogorodica is their depiction of Orthodox councils as a symbol that referred to the challenges the Orthodox Church faced against the Catholic Church, a situation common in the borderlands between Catholicism and Orthodoxy in the Balkans.
The church has an inscription, written in Persian language and incised in Arabic script over the fresco, of a verse composed by the Persian poet Hafez.

In the 15th century, Prizren became part of the expanding Ottoman Empire. In 1455, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror (&quot;Fatih Mehmet&quot;) visited Prizren, which at the time had eight Orthodox and two Catholic churches. Sultan Mehmed chose Bogorodica to become a mosque. An inscription in the church describes the event of the conversion. The conversion into a mosque saw the erection of a minaret, which was removed in 1923 after Serbia had annexed Kosovo. In this period, it was formally called &quot;Fatih camisi&quot;, while popularly it was known as &quot;Cuma Cami&quot;, which is how the site is known to the local inhabitants. The archival records of the mosque are a valuable source for the history of Ottoman Prizren. In the Great Turkish War, the Austrian army held Prizren briefly. As a plague erupted, imperial general Silvio Piccolomini visited Prizren to meet Catholic Archbishop Pjetër Bogdani. There, a few days later he died as he had contracted the plague and was buried in the graveyard of the church.

In 1948, it was recognized by the Yugoslav government as a protected cultural site and in 1950–52 a large-scale reconstruction and restoration project began. When it was completed, the site was turned into a museum. Further restoration work was done in the 1970s and 1980s.
In 1990, Serbia designated it a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance. After the Kosovo War, the complex was guarded by KFOR. It was heavily damaged during the 2004 unrest in Kosovo when it was burnt along with other Serbian Orthodox sites. On 13 July 2006, it was placed on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List as an extension of the Visoki Dečani site (named Medieval Monuments in Kosovo), which, as a whole, was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger. In 2005–2008, it was restored by the Commission for Implementation of Reconstruction for Serbian Orthodox Church monuments in Kosovo of the European Union. The site is part of the protected cultural heritage of the Kosovo under its Ministry of Culture. In 2020, conservation and restoration of the exterior and churchyard was carried out, under finance of the Serbian Ministry of Culture and Information.

<text>William Reginald Gardiner (27 February 1903 – 7 July 1980) was an English actor on the stage, in films and on television.

==Early years==
Gardiner was born in Wimbledon, England, and he was a graduate of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. His parents wanted him to be an architect, but he insisted on a career as an actor.

==Stage and radio==
Gardiner started as a &quot;super&quot; on stage and eventually became well known on the West End stage. &quot;He appeared in British revues, plays and films before delighting Broadway audiences in 1935 with a wallpaper imitation act in &quot;At Home Abroad&quot;.&quot; His other Broadway credits include &quot;Little Glass Clock&quot; and &quot;An Evening with Beatrice Lillie&quot;.

He was also well known to radio listeners, and was known on the air for his amusing train and car noises.

==Film==
Gardiner worked in almost 100 movies. He started film work in crowd scenes, making his big film break in 1927 the silent film &quot;The Lodger&quot;, by Alfred Hitchcock.

His Hollywood film debut came in 1936. During his career he was cast in numerous roles, often as a British butler. One of his most famous roles was that of Schultz in Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;. He also performed memorable turns as Beverly Carlton (a parody of Noël Coward) in &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot;, the spurned &quot;almost-husband&quot; in &quot;The Doctor Takes a Wife&quot;, &quot;Christmas in Connecticut&quot; and – one of his most memorable roles – in the Laurel and Hardy epic &quot;The Flying Deuces&quot;.

==Television==
Gardiner made numerous guest appearances on television in the 1950s and 1960s, including an episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (&quot;Banquo&#x27;s Chair&quot;), Fess Parker&#x27;s ABC series, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, and Stanley Holloway&#x27;s &quot;Our Man Higgins&quot;. In 1964, he guest-starred in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; episode &quot;The Case of the Ugly Duckling&quot;, as business owner Albert Charity, and in the role of Mr. Maudlin in the season 6, episode 19, &quot;Dead as a Dude&quot; of &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;. In 1966, Gardiner was featured on &quot;Green Acres&quot; as orchestra conductor Sir Geoffrey in the first-season episode &quot;Culture&quot;. In 1967, he made a guest appearance on &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, in the episode &quot;Uncle Joe and the Master Plan&quot;, as Gaylord Martindale and, in 1968, he appeared as a butler in an episode of “The Monkees” titled “The Monkees Mind Their Manor”. Gardiner&#x27;s last major role was alongside Phyllis Diller in her 1966–1967 ABC series &quot;The Pruitts of Southampton&quot;.

==Recordings==
Gardiner recorded a curious and eccentric classic called &quot;Trains&quot;, which was regularly played on the 1950s British radio programme &quot;Children&#x27;s Favourites&quot;. This record consisted of a tipsy-sounding Gardiner reciting a monologue, which he first introduced in the 1935 Broadway revue &quot;At Home Abroad&quot;, about steam railway engines (which he claimed were &#x27;livid beasts&#x27;) and impersonating both the engines themselves and the sound of trains running on the track. This latter he famously characterised as &#x27;diddly-dee, diddly-dum&#x27; to mimic the sound pattern as the four pairs of bogie wheels ran over joins between the lengths of track – a sound no longer heard since welded rail joins were introduced. &quot;Trains&quot; was released as a 78 and a 45 by English Decca Records (F 5278) which remained on catalogue into the 1970s. At the end of the record Gardiner signs off with &quot;Well folks, that&#x27;s all: back to the asylum.&quot; He was summoned to Buckingham Palace to give a performance in person.

==Personal life==
Gardiner was married twice. He first married Wyn Richmond, a British actress, but they divorced. Later he married model Nadia Petrova. Gardiner and Nadia Petrova had a son Peter Robert Gardiner, born on April 25, 1949. 

Gardiner had a son out of wedlock with Jane Bagnato in Toronto, Canada: Reginald James &quot;Jamie&quot; Gardiner was born January 1, 1939. He left Jane and his son after three years to marry Nadia. Jamie&#x27;s last name was changed to Williams at age 8, after his mother married Reginald Williams in 1947.

==Death==
Gardiner died of a heart attack at his home in Westwood, California, on 7 July 1980. He was survived by his wife Nadia.

<text>Marie Smith Jones (May 14, 1918January 21, 2008) was an American national who was the last surviving speaker of the Eyak language of Southcentral Alaska. She was born in Cordova, Alaska, was an honorary chief of the Eyak Nation and the last remaining full-blooded Eyak. In a 2005 interview, Smith Jones explained that her name in Eyak is (&quot;/&quot;&quot;/&quot;) which, she said, translates as &quot;a sound that calls people from afar&quot;.

==Biography==
Jones married a fisherman, William F. Smith, on May 5, 1948. Although she had nine children with Smith, they did not learn to speak Eyak due to the social stigma associated with it at the time. She moved to Anchorage in the 1970s. So that a record of the Eyak language would survive, she worked with linguist Michael E. Krauss, who compiled a dictionary and grammar of it. Her last older sibling died in the 1990s. Afterwards, Jones became politically active, and on two occasions she spoke at the United Nations on the issues of peace and indigenous languages. She was also active regarding environmental Indian issues, including clearcutting. Jones suffered from alcoholism earlier in her life, but gave up drinking while in her early 50s; she remained a heavy smoker until her death. She died of natural causes on January 21, 2008, at age 89 at her home in Anchorage.

<text>Banana is a small seaport in the Kongo Central province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the Atlantic coast. The port is situated in Banana Creek, an inlet about 1 km wide on the north bank of the Congo River&#x27;s mouth, separated from the ocean by a spit of land 3 km long and 100 to 400 m wide. The port is located on the creek side of the spit, which shelters it from the ocean. It is about 8 km south-east of Muanda to which it is connected by a paved road running along the coast.

==Facilities==
The port of Banana consists of one wharf of 75 m and depth 5.18 m, with two small cranes for cargo handling and a few small jetties. The port has an oil terminal 4 km further upriver, to which tankers discharge while at anchor in the creek. This terminal has road access separate from the main port east of Muanda. There are no major facilities in Banana apart from the port, since these are provided by the much larger town of Muanda, where the nearest airport is located. There is no rail link.

There is also a naval base of the Navy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is partly maintained with Chinese assistance.

In early 2022, a $1.2 billion construction project began to turn the port into the DRC&#x27;s first deep-water port. The work is being carried out by DP World, despite a lack of public tender, as part of its 30 year development and management contract. When completed in 2025, the port is expected to process over 300,000 containers per year. The project has been criticized for its potential environmental threats, since it borders the country&#x27;s Mangroves National Park, home to vulnerable and endangered plant and animal species.

== Climate ==


==History==
The town was developed as a port in the 19th century, largely as part of the slave trade. Henry Morton Stanley arrived at Banana in 1879 at the start of an exploratory expedition funded by Leopold II of Belgium. Following the Conference of Berlin (1884–85) the European powers recognised Léopold&#x27;s claim to the Congo Basin, and the establishment of the Congo Free State, headed by himself, beginning the period of European colonization.

The Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911) article on the folkloric belief in werewolves noted that &quot;The people of Banana are said to change themselves by magical means, composed of human embryos and other ingredients, but in their leopard form they may do no hurt to mankind under pain of retaining for ever the beast shape.&quot;

Banana was the main Belgian naval base of the Congo until independence in 1960.
