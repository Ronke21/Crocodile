<text>Indo-Pacific is a hypothetical language macrofamily proposed in 1971 by Joseph Greenberg and now believed to be spurious. It grouped together the Papuan languages of New Guinea and Melanesia with the languages of the Andaman Islands (or at least Great Andamanese) and, tentatively, the languages of Tasmania, both of which are remote from New Guinea. The valid cognates Greenberg found turned out to be reflexes of the less extensive Trans–New Guinea family. Recently the Kusunda language (and possibly other unclassificated languages), which is generally seen as a language isolate, is also included in the Indo-Pacific proposal. Greenberg did not include &quot;Australian&quot; in his original 1971 proposal.

==Proposal==
The Indo-Pacific proposal, grouping the non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea with certain languages spoken on islands to the east and west of New Guinea, was first made by Greenberg in 1971. Greenberg&#x27;s supporter Merritt Ruhlen considers Indo-Pacific an extremely diverse and ancient family, far older than Austronesian, which reflects a migration from southeast Asia that began only 6,000 years ago; he notes that New Guinea was inhabited by modern humans at least 40,000 years ago, and possibly 10,000 to 15,000 years earlier than that. Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza sees Indo-Pacific as a very heterogenous family of 700 languages and suggests that it may be more than 40,000 years old.

==Reception==

Greenberg&#x27;s proposal was based on rough estimation of lexical similarity and typological similarity and has not reached a stage where it can be confirmed by the standard comparative method, including the reconstruction of a protolanguage. The languages of Tasmania are extinct and so poorly attested that many historical linguists regard them as unclassifiable. Roger Blench has dismissed the Indo-Pacific proposal as improbable, observing that while it &quot;purported to be a purely linguistic exercise...it conveniently swept up all the languages of the crinklyhaired populations in the region that were not clearly Austronesian.&quot; He writes that despite decades of further research into Papuan languages and prehistory, Indo-Pacific is still not accepted by specialists and that it &quot;only exists in the eye of the believer.&quot; George van Driem (2001) responds as follows:

Since Greenberg&#x27;s work, the languages of New Guinea have been intensively studied by Stephen Wurm. Wurm&#x27;s Trans–New Guinea languages family includes about 70 percent of the languages Greenberg included in Indo-Pacific, though the internal classification is entirely different. Wurm states that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese, West Papuan (which is not part of Trans–New Guinea), and certain languages of Timor &quot;are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity [...] in a number of instances&quot;, but considers this to be due to a linguistic substratum rather than a direct relationship.

Pawley (2008) is the only thorough review of the proposal. He found that all branches of Indo-Pacific except Tasmanian and Andamanese include languages from Trans–New Guinea, and that this explains the more reasonable cognates that Greenberg proposed, but because these Trans–New Guinea languages are mixed in with languages from other families in those branches, cognates linking the branches do not provide support for Greenberg&#x27;s proposal that all Papuan languages are related.

==Subdivision==

According to Greenberg, Indo-Pacific consists of fourteen families, not counting a few which he could not classify. He suggested a tentative sub-classification into seven groups, listed in bold below. Some languages have not been identified.

===Comparison===
This classification was never widely accepted, and was largely passed over for that of Stephen Wurm. They do not agree well. For example,

*Greenberg&#x27;s North New Guinea family corresponds to four of Wurm&#x27;s families: Sko, Sepik–Ramu, Torricelli, and the Northern branch of Trans–New Guinea;
*Greenberg&#x27;s West New Guinea family corresponds to four of Wurm&#x27;s: East Bird&#x27;s Head, Geelvink Bay, the South Bird&#x27;s Head and West Bomberai branches of Trans–New Guinea, and the Bird&#x27;s Head branch of West Papuan.

The few similarities are retentions from earlier linguists&#x27; work:

*Greenberg&#x27;s Northeast New Guinea family and Wurm&#x27;s Madang–Adelbert Range branch of Trans–New Guinea reflect John Z&#x27;graggen&#x27;s Madang–Adelbert Range,
*Greenberg&#x27;s Eastern New Guinea family and Wurm&#x27;s Eastern Main-Section branch of Trans–New Guinea both preserve Tom Dutton&#x27;s Southeast New Guinea family.

<doc id="545518" wikidata="Q2613987" url="?curid=545518" title="NCAA Division I men's soccer tournament">
<text>The NCAA Division I men&#x27;s soccer tournament, sometimes known as the College Cup, is an American intercollegiate soccer tournament conducted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and determines the Division I men&#x27;s national champion. The tournament was formally held in 1959, when it was an eight-team tournament. Since then, the tournament has expanded to 48 teams, in which every Division I conference tournament champion is allocated a berth. Among the most successful programs, Saint Louis won 10 titles during dynasty years between 1959 and 1973. Indiana has won 8 titles beginning in 1982, whereas Virginia has won 7 titles beginning in 1989.

Although the tournament is frequently referenced as the &quot;College Cup&quot;, the NCAA applies the title only to the semifinal and championship rounds of the tournament proper. Since the tournament began, the semifinal and final fixtures have been held at a neutral site predetermined by the NCAA before starting the regular season.

== Format ==

The NCAA Division I men&#x27;s soccer tournament is a 48-team, single-elimination tournament. Currently, 23 spots are reserved for the winners of automatic bids.

As of the current 2024 NCAA men&#x27;s soccer season, the following conferences are expected to be granted automatic qualification: 

* America East
* American Athletic
* ASUN
* Atlantic Coast
* Atlantic 10
* Big East
* Big South
* Big Ten
* Big West
* Coastal Athletic Association
* Horizon League
* Ivy League
* Metro Atlantic
* Missouri Valley
* Northeast
* Ohio Valley
* Patriot League
* Southern
* Summit League
* Sun Belt
* West Coast
* Western Athletic
Each conference determines the format for its conference championship, which determines the school that receives its automatic bid. Many use conference tournaments, although three conferences award the championship and automatic bid to the regular-season champion. The remaining 26 teams receive at-large bids. The at-large teams are selected by a committee consisting of representatives from each of the eight regions the NCAA has divided the country into. The committee uses a number of criteria, the most influential supposedly being the Ratings Percentage Index, a mathematical formula designed to objectively compare the results and strength of schedule of all Division I teams.

The top 16 teams are seeded into the bracket and receive first round byes. The other 32 are grouped by geographical proximity. The first four rounds are played on campus sites, with matches being hosted by the higher seed. The College Cup, comprising the semifinal and final matches, is played at a predetermined site.

Vermont is the current champion, defeating Marshall 2–1 in overtime in the 2024 final.

<text>Chard or Swiss chard (; &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot;, Cicla Group and Flavescens Group) is a green leafy vegetable. In the cultivars of the Flavescens Group, the leaf stalks are large and often prepared separately from the leaf blade; the Cicla Group is the leafy spinach beet. The leaf blade can be green or reddish; the leaf stalks are usually white, yellow or red.

Chard, like other green leafy vegetables, has highly nutritious leaves. Chard has been used in cooking for centuries, but because it is the same species as beetroot, the common names that cooks and cultures have used for chard may be confusing; it has many common names, such as silver beet, perpetual spinach, beet spinach, seakale beet, or leaf beet.

==Classification==
Chard was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus as &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; var. &quot;cicla&quot;. Its taxonomic rank has changed many times: it has been treated as a subspecies, a convariety, and a variety of &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot;. (Among the numerous synonyms for it are &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;cicla&quot; (Cicla Group), &quot;B. vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;cicla&quot; var. &quot;cicla&quot; , &quot;B. vulgaris&quot; var. &quot;cycla&quot; , &quot;B. vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; (Leaf Beet Group), &quot;B. vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; (Spinach Beet Group), &quot;B. vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;cicla&quot; ( (Flavescens Group), &quot;B. vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;cicla&quot; var. &quot;flavescens&quot; , &quot;B. vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; (Leaf Beet Group), &quot;B. vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot; (Swiss Chard Group)). The accepted name for all beet cultivars, like chard, sugar beet and beetroot, is &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;vulgaris&quot;. They are cultivated descendants of the sea beet, &quot;Beta vulgaris&quot; subsp. &quot;maritima&quot;. Chard belongs to the chenopods, which are now mostly included in the family Amaranthaceae (&quot;sensu lato&quot;).

The two rankless cultivar groups for chard are the Cicla Group for the leafy spinach beet and the Flavescens Group for the stalky Swiss chard.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;chard&quot; descends from the 14th-century French &quot;carde&quot;, from Latin &quot;carduus&quot; meaning artichoke thistle (or cardoon which also includes the artichoke) itself.

The origin of the adjective &quot;Swiss&quot; is unclear. Some attribute the name to it having been first described by a Swiss botanist, either Gaspard Bauhin or Karl Koch (although the latter was German, not Swiss). Be it as it may chard is used in Swiss cuisine, e.g. in the traditional dish &quot;capuns&quot; from the canton of Grisons.

==Growth and harvesting==
Chard is a biennial. Clusters of chard seeds are usually sown, in the Northern Hemisphere, between June and October, the exact time depending on the desired harvesting period. Chard can be harvested while the leaves are young and tender, or after maturity when they are larger and have slightly tougher stems. Harvesting is a continual process, as most species of chard produce three or more crops.

==Cultivars==
Cultivars of chard include green forms, such as &#x27;Lucullus&#x27; and &#x27;Fordhook Giant,&#x27; as well as red-ribbed forms, such as &#x27;Ruby Chard&#x27; and &#x27;Rhubarb Chard.&#x27; The red-ribbed forms are attractive in the garden, but as a general rule, the older green forms tend to outproduce the colorful hybrids. &#x27;Rainbow Chard&#x27; is a mix of colored varieties often mistaken for a single variety.

Chard has shiny, green, ribbed leaves, with petioles that range in color from white to yellow to red, depending on the cultivar.

Chard may be harvested in the garden all summer by cutting individual leaves as needed. In the Northern Hemisphere, chard is typically ready to harvest as early as April and lasts until there is a hard frost, typically below . It is one of the hardier leafy greens, with a harvest season that typically lasts longer than that of kale, spinach, or baby greens.

==Culinary use==
Fresh chard can be used raw in salads, stirfries, soups or omelets. The raw leaves can be used like a tortilla wrap. Chard leaves and stalks are typically boiled or sautéed; the bitterness fades with cooking.

It is one of the most common ingredients of Croatian cuisine in the Dalmatia region, being known as &quot;queen of the Dalmatian garden&quot; and used in various ways (boiled, in stews, in Soparnik etc.). 

==Nutritional content==
In a serving, raw Swiss chard provides of food energy and has rich content (&gt; 19% of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamins A, K, and C, with 122%, 1038%, and 50%, respectively, of the DV. Also having significant content in raw chard are dietary fiber, vitamin K and the dietary minerals magnesium, manganese, iron, and potassium. Raw chard has a low content of carbohydrates, protein, and fat.

Cooked chard is 93% water, 4% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and contains negligible fat. In a reference 100 g serving, cooked chard supplies 20 calories, with vitamin and mineral contents reduced compared to raw chard, but still present in significant proportions of the DV, especially for vitamin A, vitamin K, vitamin C, and magnesium (see table).

<text>USS &quot;Fletcher&quot; (DD/DDE-445), named for Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, was the lead , and served in the Pacific during World War II. She received fifteen battle stars for World War II service, and five for Korean War service.

&quot;Fletcher&quot; was laid down by the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Kearny, New Jersey, on 2 October 1941. She was launched on 3 May 1942; sponsored by Mrs. F. F. Fletcher, widow of Admiral Fletcher; and commissioned on 30 June 1942.

==Service history==

===World War II===

====1942====
&quot;Fletcher&quot; arrived at Nouméa, New Caledonia on 5 October 1942 from the east coast, and at once began escort and patrol duty in the Guadalcanal operation, bombarding Lunga Point on 30 October. Sailing from Espiritu Santo 9 November to cover the landing of reinforcements on the island, she joined in driving off an enemy air attack on the transports 12 November, claiming several enemy aircraft shot down. This was the opening phase of the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, a 3-day air and surface action. &quot;Fletcher&quot; played an important part in the surface action off Guadalcanal 13 November, firing guns and torpedoes in the general melee which sank two Japanese destroyers and damaged the fast battleship , later sunk by carrier and Marine aircraft.

&quot;Fletcher&quot; retired to replenish at Espiritu Santo, arriving the day after the battle, and after patrolling against submarines off Nouméa, sortied on 30 November 1942, with a force of cruisers and destroyers, to intercept a force of enemy transports and destroyers expected to attempt a reinforcement of Guadalcanal that night. &quot;Fletcher&quot; led the force through Lengo Channel, and made the first radar contact with the enemy off Tassafaronga Point just before midnight. The resulting Battle of Tassafaronga saw one Japanese destroyer sunk, and one slightly damaged, and four American cruisers badly damaged, though all but one were saved by prompt damage control. &quot;Fletcher&quot; rescued survivors of , using cork-floated cargo nets to take great groups of them from the water.

====1943====
 The destroyer continued to operate in the Solomon Islands, patrolling, shelling shore targets, driving off Japanese air attacks, rescuing downed aviators, sinking Japanese landing barges, and covering new landings on the northern coast of Guadalcanal. Out on patrol on 11 February 1943, &quot;Fletcher&quot; was alerted by a smoke float dropped by a plane from , and sped to attack and sink . She supported the landings on the Russell Islands on 21 February, bombarded Munda airfield on New Georgia during the night of 5/6 March, and then continued to guard the movement of transports in the Solomons.

From 23 April to 4 May 1943, &quot;Fletcher&quot; was in Sydney, Australia, for a refit before another month of general duty in the Solomons. She left Espiritu Santo on 19 June for a Stateside overhaul, returning to Nouméa on 27 September to resume her former activities until 31 October. Then she sortied with an aircraft carrier task force to provide air support for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands, fighting off a Japanese counterattack from the air 26 November. Again, &quot;Fletcher&quot; fired on Japanese aircraft on 4 December, when the task force came under an air attack after it had made a strike on Kwajalein island.

====1944====

&quot;Fletcher&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 December 1943, and after a brief overhaul and training on the west coast, was ready for the attack on the Marshall Islands. She screened a force of troop transports from San Diego to Lahaina Roads from 13 to 21 January 1944, then joined a bombardment group to fire on Wotje Atoll 30 January. The next day, she rendezvoused with the main attack force for the landings on Kwajalein, screening the transports and patrolling off the atoll until 4 February. After escorting empty transports to Funafuti, &quot;Fletcher&quot; reported at Majuro 15 February for duty screening battleships in bombardments of Taroa and Wotje on 20 February and 21 February, then patrolled off Eniwetok.

After joining in training exercises off Port Purvis on Florida Island, in the Solomons, &quot;Fletcher&quot; arrived at Cape Sudest, New Guinea, 18 April 1944. This was her base during the next month as she supported the Humboldt Bay landings, and by covering reinforcement landings on 30 April. After escorting a convoy to Nouméa, out of which she patrolled against submarines in late May, &quot;Fletcher&quot; arrived at Humboldt Bay on 5 June. She made one patrol against any attempt of the Japanese to reinforce their Biak garrison, then covered and provided shore bombardment for the invasions of Noemfoor, Sansapor, and Morotai, as well as patrolling and escorting reinforcements for these various operations through the summer.

&quot;Fletcher&quot; reached Manus on 9 October 1944 from Humboldt Bay to prepare for the invasion of Leyte, for which she sortied 12 October screening transports. She covered them while they sent their boats ashore in the initial landings 20 October, and next day departed for New Guinea, thus clearing Leyte Gulf before the great battle for its control broke out. She returned to Leyte with transports carrying reinforcements 23 November, and through the next month, continued her support of the first phase of the liberation of the Philippines, escorting convoys, firing prelanding bombardments at Ormoc Bay and Mindoro, and firing on Japanese aircraft in several attacks.

====1945====
On 4 January 1945, &quot;Fletcher&quot; sortied from San Pedro Bay to provide close cover for the Luzon Attack Force as it sailed toward its objective. She splashed at least one of the many Japanese aircraft which attacked on 8 January, and during the landings in Lingayen Gulf the next day, patrolled the Gulf. After supporting the landings on San Antonio Beach, Luzon, on 29 January, she entered Subic Bay to cover minesweeping, then on 31 January provided fire support to the landings in Nasugbu Bay. &quot;Fletcher&quot; began four days of operations in the occupation of Bataan and Corregidor on 13 February, firing a preliminary bombardment, giving fire support on call, and covering minesweepers opening Manila Bay. On 14 February, while firing on Japanese batteries at Los Cochinos Point, &quot;Fletcher&quot; took a hit which killed eight and wounded three of her crew. She continued to fire as she controlled damage, and a half-hour later added rescue operations to her activities as she took the survivors off &quot;YMS-48&quot;, also hit by Japanese fire. Water Tender Second Class Elmer C. Bigelow was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his &quot;conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity&quot; while fighting the fire on board the destroyer. &quot;Fletcher&quot;″s firing in Manila Bay continued until the 17th.

&quot;Fletcher&quot; took part in the landings at Puerto Princesa, Palawan, and Zamboanga, covered minesweeping and landings at Tarakan, and gave local patrol and escort service in the Philippines until 13 May 1945, when she sailed for a West Coast overhaul. After exercises off San Diego and in Hawaii, she was docked at San Diego until placed in commission in reserve 7 August 1946, and out of commission in reserve 15 January 1947.

===1949–1969===
Recommissioned 3 October 1949 as a specialist in antisubmarine warfare (ASW) after conversion to an escort destroyer (DDE-445), &quot;Fletcher&quot; sailed for San Diego 1 May 1950 for a tour of duty with the 7th Fleet in the western Pacific. At the outbreak of the Korean War, she lay at Hong Kong with , and on 3 July arrived off Korea with the &quot;Valley Forge&quot; group, augmented by , to begin launching airstrikes on North Korea. Through the summer, she sailed off Korea on this duty, replenishing when necessary at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, or Sasebo, Japan. She also participated in the Battle of Inchon from 13 to 17 September, and returned to Pearl Harbor, her home port, on 11 November.

On 19 November 1951, &quot;Fletcher&quot; cleared Pearl Harbor for another tour of duty screening the carriers of the 7th Fleet in Korean operations. She also fired shore bombardment on two occasions, participated in antisubmarine training off Okinawa, and patrolled in the Taiwan Straits. Returning to Pearl Harbor on 20 June 1952, she was at sea again from 5 September to 24 November for Operation Ivy, then completed another tour of Far Eastern duty from 14 May to 30 November 1953.

Annually from 1954 to 1962, &quot;Fletcher&quot; sailed to the Far East for duty with the 7th Fleet, in 1955 providing antisubmarine screening for the evacuation of the Tachen Islands. In both 1957 and 1958, she made her outward bound passage by way of Samoa and Australia. Intensive antisubmarine training was her major occupation during periods between deployment.

&quot;Fletcher&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1969, and sold for scrap on 22 February 1972.

==Awards==
&quot;Fletcher&quot; received fifteen battle stars for World War II service, and five for Korean War service, making her one of the most decorated US ships of World War II.

* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with fifteen battle stars 
* World War II Victory Medal 
* China Service Medal
* National Defense Service Medal with star
* Korean Service Medal with five battle stars
* Philippine Presidential Unit Citation
* Korean Presidential Unit Citation
* Philippine Liberation Medal with two stars
* United Nations Service Medal
* Korean War Service Medal

==On film==
&quot;Fletcher&quot; appears in the 1960 comedy film &quot;The Wackiest Ship in the Army&quot;, starring Jack Lemmon (appears in the harbor when the USS &quot;Echo&quot; is first visited), and also in the film &quot;Down Periscope&quot; in stock footage as the ship that is targeted and sunk to end the film&#x27;s war games.

<doc id="545523" wikidata="Q14879985" url="?curid=545523" title="Collard (plant)">
<text>Collard is a group of loose-leafed cultivars of &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;, the same species as many common vegetables including cabbage and broccoli. Part of the Acephala (kale) cultivar group, it is also classified as the variety &quot;B. oleracea&quot; var. &quot;viridis&quot;.

The plants are grown as a food crop for their large, dark-green, edible leaves, which are cooked and eaten as vegetables. Collard greens have been cultivated as food since classical antiquity.

== Nomenclature ==
The term &quot;colewort&quot; is a medieval term for non-heading brassica crops.

The term collard has been used to include many non-heading &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot; crops. While American collards are best placed in the &quot;Viridis&quot; crop group, the acephala (Greek for &#x27;without a head&#x27;) cultivar group is also used referring to a lack of close-knit core of leaves (a &quot;head&quot;) like cabbage does, making collards more tolerant of high humidity levels and less susceptible to fungal diseases.

In Africa, it is known as &quot;sukuma&quot; (East Africa), &quot;muriwo&quot; or &quot;umBhida&quot; (Southern Africa). In Kashmir, it is known as &quot;haakh&quot; (Kashmir).

== Description ==
The plant is a biennial where winter frost occurs; some varieties may be perennial in warmer regions. It has an upright stalk, often growing over two feet tall and up to six feet for the Portuguese cultivars. Popular cultivars of collard greens include &#x27;Georgia Southern&#x27;, &#x27;Vates&#x27;, &#x27;Morris Heading&#x27;, &#x27;Blue Max&#x27;, &#x27;Top Bunch&#x27;, &#x27;Butter Collard&#x27; (&quot;couve manteiga&quot;), &quot;couve tronchuda&quot;, and &quot;Groninger Blauw&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
Collard is generally described as part of the Acephala (kale) cultivar group, but is also classified as the variety &quot;B. oleracea&quot; var. &quot;viridis&quot;.

== Cultivation ==
The plant is commercially cultivated for its thick, slightly bitter, edible leaves. They are available year-round, but are tastier and more nutritious in the cold months, after the first frost. For best texture, the leaves are picked before they reach their maximum size, at which stage they are thicker and are cooked differently from the new leaves. Age does not affect flavor. 

Flavor and texture also depend on the cultivar; the &quot;couve manteiga&quot; and &quot;couve tronchuda&quot; are especially appreciated in Brazil and Portugal. The large number of varieties grown in the United States decreased as people moved to towns after World War II, leaving only five varieties commonly in cultivation. However, seeds of many varieties remained in use by individual farmers, growers and seed savers as well as within U.S. government seed collections. In the Appalachian region, &quot;cabbage collards&quot;, characterized by yellow-green leaves and a partially heading structure are more popular than the dark-green non-heading types in the coastal South. There have been projects from the early 2000s to both preserve seeds of uncommon varieties and also enable more varieties to return to cultivation.

=== Pests ===
The sting nematode, &quot;Belonolaimus gracilis&quot; and the awl nematode, &quot;Dolichodorus spp.&quot; are both ectoparasites that can injure collard. Root symptoms include stubby or coarse roots that are dark at the tips. Shoot symptoms include stunted growth, premature wilting, and chlorosis (Nguyen and Smart, 1975). Another species of the sting worm, &quot;Belonolaimus longicaudatus&quot;, is a pest of collards in Georgia and North Carolina (Robbins and Barker, 1973). &quot;B. longicaudatus&quot; is devastating to seedlings and transplants. As few as three nematodes per of soil when transplanting can cause significant yield losses on susceptible plants. They are most common in sandy soils (Noling, 2012).

The stubby root nematodes &quot;Trichodorus&quot; and &quot;Paratrichodorus&quot; attach and feed near the tip of collard&#x27;s taproots. The damage caused prevents proper root elongation leading to tight mats that could appear swollen, therefore resulting in a &quot;stubby root&quot; (Noling, 2012).

Several species of the root knot nematode &quot;Meloidogyne spp.&quot; infest collards. These include: &quot;M. javanica&quot;, &quot;M. incognita&quot; and &quot;M. arenaria&quot;. Second-stage juveniles attack the plant and settle in the roots. However, infestation seems to occur at lower populations compared to other cruciferous plants. Root symptoms include deformation (galls) and injury that prevent proper water and nutrient uptake. This could eventually lead to stunting, wilting and chlorosis of the shoots.

The false root knot nematode &quot;Nacobbus aberrans&quot; has a wide host range of up to 84 species including many weeds. On Brassicas it has been reported in several states, including Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Montana, South Dakota, and Kansas (Manzanilla-López et al., 2002). As a pest of collards, the degree of damage is dependent upon the nematode population in the soil.

Some collard cultivars exhibit resistance to bacterial leaf blight incited by &quot;Pseudomonas cannabina&quot; pv. &quot;alisalensis&quot; (&quot;Pca&quot;).

== Uses ==

=== Nutrition ===
Raw collard greens are 90% water, 6% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and contain negligible fat (table). Like kale, collard greens contain substantial amounts of vitamin K (339% of the Daily Value, DV) in a serving. Collard greens are rich sources (20% or more of DV) of vitamin A, vitamin C, and manganese, and moderate sources of calcium and vitamin B6. A reference serving of cooked collard greens provides of food energy.

=== Culinary ===
==== East Africa ====
Collard greens are known as &quot;sukuma&quot; in Swahilli and are one of the most common vegetables in East Africa. &quot;Sukuma&quot; is mainly lightly sauteed in oil until tender, flavoured with onions and seasoned with salt, and served either as the main accompaniment or as a side dish with meat or fish. In Congo, Tanzania and Kenya (East Africa), thinly sliced collard greens are the main accompaniments of a popular dish known as &quot;sima&quot; or &quot;ugali&quot; (made with maize flour).

==== Southern and Eastern Europe ====
Collards have been cultivated in Europe for thousands of years with references to the Greeks and Romans back to the 1st century CE. In Montenegro, Dalmatia and Herzegovina, collard greens, locally known as &quot;raštika&quot; or &quot;raštan&quot;, were traditionally one of the staple vegetables. It is particularly popular in the winter, stewed with smoked mutton (&quot;kaštradina&quot;) or cured pork, root vegetables and potatoes. Known in Turkey as &quot;kara lahana&quot; (&quot;dark cabbage&quot;), it is a staple in the Black Sea area. It is also an essential ingredient in many Spanish soups and stews, like the pote asturiano, from the Asturian province. 

==== United States ====
Collard greens are a staple vegetable in Southern U.S. cuisine. They are often prepared with other similar green leaf vegetables, such as spinach, kale, turnip greens, and mustard greens in the dish called &quot;mixed greens&quot;. Typically used in combination with collard greens are smoked and salted meats (ham hocks, smoked turkey drumsticks, smoked turkey necks, pork neckbones, fatback or other fatty meat), diced onions, vinegar, salt, and black pepper, white pepper, or crushed red pepper, and some cooks add a small amount of sugar. Traditionally, collards are eaten on New Year&#x27;s Day, along with black-eyed peas or field peas and cornbread, to ensure wealth in the coming year. Cornbread is used to soak up the &quot;pot liquor&quot;, a nutrient-rich collard broth. Collard greens may also be thinly sliced and fermented to make a collard sauerkraut that is often cooked with flat dumplings. Landrace collard in-situ genetic diversity and ethnobotany are subjects of research for citizen-science groups. 

During the time of slavery in the U.S., collards were one of the most common plants grown in kitchen gardens and were used to supplement the rations provided by plantation owners. Greens were widely used because the plants could last through the winter weather and could withstand the heat of a southern summer even more so than spinach or lettuce.

Broadly, collard greens symbolize Southern culture and African-American culture and identity. For example, jazz composer and pianist, Thelonious Monk, sported a collard leaf in his lapel to represent his African-American heritage. In President Barack Obama&#x27;s first state dinner, collard greens were included on the menu. Novelist and poet Alice Walker used collards to reference the intersection of African-American heritage and black women. There have been many collard festivals that celebrate African-American identity, including those in Port Wentworth, Georgia (since 1997), East Palo Alto, California (since 1998), Columbus, Ohio (since 2010), and Atlanta, Georgia (since 2011). In 2010, the Latibah Collard Greens Museum opened in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Many explorers in the late nineteenth century have written about the pervasiveness of collards in Southern cooking particularly among black Americans. In 1869, Hyacinth, a traveler during the Civil War, for example, observed that collards could be found anywhere in the south. In 1972, another observer, Stearns, echoed that sentiment claiming that collards were present in every black Southerner&#x27;s garden. In 1883, a writer commented on the fact that there is no word or dish more popular among poorer whites and blacks than collard greens. The collard sandwich—consisting of fried cornbread, collard greens, and fatback—is a popular dish among the Lumbee people in Robeson County, North Carolina.

==== Brazil and Portugal ====

In Portuguese and Brazilian cuisine, collard greens (or &quot;couve&quot;) are a common accompaniment to fish and meat dishes. They make up a standard side dish for &quot;feijoada&quot;, a popular pork and beans-style stew. These Brazilian and Portuguese cultivars are likely members of a distinct non-heading cultivar group of &quot;Brassica oleracea&quot;, specifically the Tronchuda Group.

Thinly-sliced collard greens are also a main ingredient of a popular Portuguese soup, the &quot;caldo verde&quot; (&quot;green broth&quot;). For this broth, the leaves are sliced into strips, wide (sometimes by a grocer or market vendor using a special hand-cranked slicer) and added to the other ingredients 15 minutes before it is served.

In Kashmir, collard greens (locally called &quot;haakh&quot;) are included in most meals. Leaves are harvested by pinching in early spring when the dormant buds sprout and give out tender leaves known as &quot;kaanyil haakh&quot;. When the extending stem bears alternate leaves in quick succession during the growing season, older leaves are harvested periodically. In late autumn, the apical portion of the stem is removed along with the whorled leaves.
There are several dishes made with &quot;haakh&quot;. A common dish eaten with rice is &quot;haak rus&quot;, a soup of whole collard leaves cooked simply with water, oil, salt, green chilies and spices.

==== Zimbabwe ====
In Zimbabwe, collard greens are known as in Ndebele and in Shona. Due to the climate, the plant thrives under almost all conditions, with most people growing it in their gardens. It is commonly eaten with sadza (ugali in East Africa, pap in South Africa, fufu in West Africa and polenta in Italy) as part of the staple food. is normally wilted in boiling water before being fried and combined with sautéed onions or tomato. Some (more traditionally, the Shona people) add beef, pork and other meat to the mix for a type of stew. Most people eat on a regular basis in Zimbabwe, as it is economical and can be grown with little effort in home gardens.

== In literature ==
Collard greens are often mentioned in literature from the American South. William Faulkner mentions collard greens as part of a Southern meal in his novel &quot;Intruder In the Dust&quot;. Walker Percy mentions collard greens in his 1983 short story &quot;The Last Donohue Show.&quot; Collards appear in Clyde Edgerton&#x27;s novel &quot;Lunch at the Piccadilly&quot;. In the novel &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;, hungry protagonist Scarlett O&#x27;Hara wistfully remembers a pre-Civil War meal that included &quot;collards swimming richly in pot liquor iridescent with grease.&quot; In Flannery O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s short story &quot;A Stroke of Good Fortune&quot;, the main character is an unhappy working-class woman who reluctantly cooks collard greens for her brother, which she finds rustic.

<text>Health physics, also referred to as the science of radiation protection, is the profession devoted to protecting people and their environment from potential radiation hazards, while making it possible to enjoy the beneficial uses of radiation. Health physicists normally require a four-year bachelor’s degree and qualifying experience that demonstrates a professional knowledge of the theory and application of radiation protection principles and closely related sciences. Health physicists principally work at facilities where radionuclides or other sources of ionizing radiation (such as X-ray generators) are used or produced; these include research, industry, education, medical facilities, nuclear power, military, environmental protection, enforcement of government regulations, and decontamination and decommissioning—the combination of education and experience for health physicists depends on the specific field in which the health physicist is engaged.

==Sub-specialties==
There are many sub-specialties in the field of health physics, including

* Ionising radiation instrumentation and measurement
* Internal dosimetry and external dosimetry
* Radioactive waste management
* Radioactive contamination, decontamination and decommissioning
* Radiological engineering (shielding, holdup, etc.)
* Environmental assessment, radiation monitoring and radon evaluation
* Operational radiation protection/health physics
* Particle accelerator physics
* Radiological emergency response/planning - (e.g., Nuclear Emergency Support Team)
* Industrial uses of radioactive material
* Medical health physics
* Public information and communication involving radioactive materials
* Biological effects/radiation biology
* Radiation standards
* Radiation risk analysis
* Nuclear power
* Radioactive materials and homeland security
* Radiation protection
* Nanotechnology

=== Operational health physics ===
The subfield of operational health physics, also called applied health physics in older sources, focuses on field work and the practical application of health physics knowledge to real-world situations, rather than basic research.

===Medical physics===
The field of Health Physics is related to the field of medical physics and they are similar to each other in that practitioners rely on much of the same fundamental science (i.e., radiation physics, biology, etc.) in both fields. Health physicists, however, focus on the evaluation and protection of human health from radiation, whereas medical health physicists and medical physicists support the use of radiation and other physics-based technologies by medical practitioners for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.

==Radiation protection instruments==
Practical ionising radiation measurement is essential for health physics. It enables the evaluation of protection measures, and the assessment of the radiation dose likely, or actually received by individuals. The provision of such instruments is normally controlled by law. In the UK it is the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999.

The measuring instruments for radiation protection are both &quot;installed&quot; (in a fixed position) and portable (hand-held or transportable).

===Installed instruments===
Installed instruments are fixed in positions which are known to be important in assessing the general radiation hazard in an area. Examples are installed &quot;area&quot; radiation monitors, Gamma interlock monitors, personnel exit monitors, and airborne contamination monitors.

The area monitor will measure the ambient radiation, usually X-Ray, Gamma or neutrons; these are radiations which can have significant radiation levels over a range in excess of tens of metres from their source, and thereby cover a wide area.

Interlock monitors are used in applications to prevent inadvertent exposure of workers to an excess dose by preventing personnel access to an area when a high radiation level is present.

Airborne contamination monitors measure the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere to guard against radioactive particles being deposited in the lungs of personnel.
Personnel exit monitors are used to monitor workers who are exiting a &quot;contamination controlled&quot; or potentially contaminated area. These can be in the form of hand monitors, clothing frisk probes, or whole body monitors. These monitor the surface of the workers body and clothing to check if any radioactive contamination has been deposited. These generally measure alpha or beta or gamma, or combinations of these.

The UK National Physical Laboratory has published a good practice guide through its Ionising Radiation Metrology Forum concerning the provision of such equipment and the methodology of calculating the alarm levels to be used.

===Portable instruments===
Portable instruments are hand-held or transportable.
The hand-held instrument is generally used as a survey meter to check an object or person in detail, or assess an area where no installed instrumentation exists. They can also be used for personnel exit monitoring or personnel contamination checks in the field. These generally measure alpha, beta or gamma, or combinations of these.

Transportable instruments are generally instruments that would have been permanently installed, but are temporarily placed in an area to provide continuous monitoring where it is likely there will be a hazard. Such instruments are often installed on trolleys to allow easy deployment, and are associated with temporary operational situations.

===Instrument types===
A number of commonly used detection instruments are listed below.

*ionization chambers
*proportional counters
*Geiger counters
*Semiconductor detectors
*Scintillation detectors

The links should be followed for a fuller description of each.

===Guidance on use===
In the United Kingdom the HSE has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned . This covers all ionising radiation instrument technologies, and is a useful comparative guide.

===Radiation dosimeters===
Dosimeters are devices worn by the user which measure the radiation dose that the user is receiving.
Common types of wearable dosimeters for ionizing radiation include:
* Quartz fiber dosimeter
* Film badge dosimeter
* Thermoluminescent dosimeter
* Solid state (MOSFET or silicon diode) dosimeter

==Units of measure==

===Absorbed dose===

The fundamental units do not take into account the amount of damage done to matter (especially living tissue) by ionizing radiation. This is more closely related to the amount of energy deposited rather than the charge. This is called the absorbed dose.
*The gray (Gy), with units J/kg, is the SI unit of absorbed dose, which represents the amount of radiation required to deposit 1 joule of energy in 1 kilogram of any kind of matter.
*The rad (radiation absorbed dose), is the corresponding traditional unit, which is 0.01 J deposited per kg. 100 rad = 1 Gy.

===Equivalent dose===

Equal doses of different types or energies of radiation cause different amounts of damage to living tissue. For example, 1 Gy of alpha radiation causes about 20 times as much damage as 1 Gy of X-rays. Therefore, the equivalent dose was defined to give an approximate measure of the biological effect of radiation. It is calculated by multiplying the absorbed dose by a weighting factor WR, which is different for each type of radiation (see table at Relative biological effectiveness#Standardization). This weighting factor is also called the Q (quality factor), or RBE (relative biological effectiveness of the radiation).
*The sievert (Sv) is the SI unit of equivalent dose. Although it has the same units as the gray, J/kg, it measures something different. For a given type and dose of radiation(s) applied to a certain body part(s) of a certain organism, it measures the magnitude of an X-rays or gamma radiation dose applied to the whole body of the organism, such that the probabilities of the two scenarios to induce cancer is the same according to current statistics.
*The rem (Roentgen equivalent man) is the traditional unit of equivalent dose. 1 sievert = 100 rem. Because the rem is a relatively large unit, typical equivalent dose is measured in millirem (mrem), 10−3 rem, or in microsievert (μSv), 10−6 Sv. 1 mrem = 10 μSv.
*A unit sometimes used for low-level doses of radiation is the BRET (Background Radiation Equivalent Time). This is the number of days of an average person&#x27;s background radiation exposure the dose is equivalent to. This unit is not standardized, and depends on the value used for the average background radiation dose. Using the 2000 UNSCEAR value (below), one BRET unit is equal to about 6.6 μSv.

For comparison, the average &#x27;background&#x27; dose of natural radiation received by a person per day, based on 2000 UNSCEAR estimate, makes BRET 6.6 μSv (660 μrem). However local exposures vary, with the yearly average in the US being around 3.6 mSv (360 mrem), and in a small area in India as high as 30 mSv (3 rem). The lethal full-body dose of radiation for a human is around 4–5 Sv (400–500 rem).

==History==
In 1898, The Röntgen Society (Currently the British Institute of Radiology) established a committee on X-ray injuries, thus initiating the discipline of radiation protection.

=== The term &quot;health physics&quot; ===
According to Paul Frame:
&quot;The term Health Physics is believed to have originated in the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in 1942, but the exact origin is unknown. The term was possibly coined by Robert Stone or Arthur Compton, since Stone was the head of the Health Division and Arthur Compton was the head of the Metallurgical Laboratory. The first task of the Health Physics Section was to design shielding for reactor CP-1 that Enrico Fermi was constructing, so the original HPs were mostly physicists trying to solve health-related problems. The explanation given by Robert Stone was that &#x27;...the term Health Physics has been used on the Plutonium Project to define that field in which physical methods are used to determine the existence of hazards to the health of personnel.&#x27;

A variation was given by Raymond Finkle, a Health Division employee during this time frame. &#x27;The coinage at first merely denoted the physics section of the Health Division... the name also served security: &#x27;radiation protection&#x27; might arouse unwelcome interest; &#x27;health physics&#x27; conveyed nothing.&#x27;&quot;
==Radiation-related quantities==
The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units.

Although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the units curie, rad, and rem alongside SI units, the European Union European units of measurement directives required that their use for &quot;public health ... purposes&quot; be phased out by 31 December 1985.

<text>USS &quot;Radford&quot; (DD-446), named for Rear Admiral William Radford, was a in the United States Navy. Entering service in 1942 during World War II the ship also saw action during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The ship was removed from service in 1969 and sold for scrap in 1970.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Radford&quot; was laid down by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at Kearny, New Jersey on 2 October 1941 and was launched on 3 May 1942 by Radford&#x27;s granddaughter Edith (Mrs. François E. Matthes). The destroyer was commissioned on 22 July 1942.

&quot;Radford&quot; participated in the Battle of Kula Gulf and the Battle of Kolombangara in July 1943. She engaged in an offensive sweep against the Tokyo Express, and received Presidential Unit Citation for the rescue of 468 survivors from the cruiser , which had been sunk at Kula Gulf. &quot;Radford&quot; depth charged and sank the , which had previously sunk destroyer and the aircraft carrier , on 25 November 1943. The destroyer was damaged by a Japanese mine while supporting the liberation of Luzon in December 1944 and received a Presidential Unit Citation from the Philippine government. The ship was decommissioned on 17 January 1946 and placed in reserve at San Francisco.

&quot;Radford&quot; was recommissioned on 17 October 1949, and operated with the United States Seventh Fleet in support of United Nations Forces during the Korean War. Following the armistice in 1953, she alternated operations along the west coast and in Hawaiian waters with annual deployments to the western Pacific with the Seventh Fleet. In 1960, &quot;Radford&quot; underwent an extensive Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM II) overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard.

On 3 March 1965, &quot;Radford&quot;, in company with other units of Destroyer Division 252, departed Pearl Harbor on short notice to augment destroyer forces for the rapidly expanding naval commitments in the South China Sea. In October and December &quot;Radford&quot; served as an alternate recovery ship in Project Gemini and participated in Sea Dragon and Market Time operations, patrolled on search and rescue duties and carried out naval gunfire support (NGFS) missions during the Vietnam War from 1965 through 1969.
Her eleventh WestPac tour began on 5 July 1966. During this period, she participated in anti-submarine operations, escorted aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin, had two tours of duty on NGFS missions, a turn on the Taiwan patrol, served as forward picket for the Seventh Fleet units operating in the South China Sea and escorted President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s support units to Malaysia during his tour of southeast Asia. DesDiv 252 returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 December 1966.

&quot;Radford&quot; was decommissioned at San Francisco just months after returning from her 1969 WestPac tour. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 10 November 1969, and sold for scrap in October 1970, but not before she fought one last battle on her own. She broke away from the tug that was towing her from Vallejo, California to the Portland, Oregon scrap yard, and took them on a , all day chase toward the Oregon coast.

==Awards==
&quot;Radford&quot; received twelve battle stars and two Presidential Unit Citations for World War II service, five battle stars for the Korean War, four for the Vietnam War, and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal.

==USS &quot;Radford&quot; National Naval Museum==

The USS &quot;Radford&quot; National Naval Museum was a collection of memorabilia about the ship that was located in Newcomerstown, Ohio. The museum closed in 2011 and its contents were moved to the USS &quot;Orleck&quot; Naval Museum that is located in Jacksonville, Florida. Exhibits include photos, uniforms, and displays about the ship and her service.

<doc id="545529" wikidata="Q188567" url="?curid=545529" title="Grameen Bank">
<text>Grameen Bank () is a microfinance, specialized community development bank founded in Bangladesh. It provides small loans (known as microcredit or &quot;grameencredit&quot;) to the impoverished without requiring collateral.

Grameen Bank is a statutory public authority. It is originated in 1976, in the work of Muhammad Yunus, a professor at the University of Chittagong, who launched a research project to study how to design a credit delivery system to provide banking services to the rural poor. In October 1983, the Grameen Bank was authorized by national legislation to operate as an independent bank.

The bank grew significantly between 2003 and 2007. As of January 2022, the total borrowers of the bank number nearly 9.5 million, and 96.81% of those are women. In 1998, the Bank&#x27;s &quot;Low-cost Housing Program&quot; won a World Habitat Award. In 2006, the bank and its founder, Muhammad Yunus, were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

The bank&#x27;s success has inspired similar projects in more than 64 countries around the world, including a World Bank initiative to finance Grameen-type lending systems.

== History ==
Muhammad Yunus was inspired during the Bangladesh famine of 1974, to make a small personal loan of US$27 to a group of 42 families, as start-up money so that they could make items for sale, without the burdens of high interest under predatory lending. Yunus believed that making such loans available to a larger population could stimulate businesses and reduce the widespread rural poverty in Bangladesh.

Yunus developed the principles of the Grameen Bank from his research and experience. &quot;Grameen Bank&quot; is Bengali for &quot;Rural&quot; or &quot;Village&quot; Bank. He began a research project, together with a national commercial bank and the University of Chittagong, extending microcredit to test his method for providing credit and banking services to the rural poor. In 1976, the village of Jobra became the first to be served by the project. Over the next two years, the project expanded to other villages in the area. The project, with support from the Bangladesh Bank, was extended in 1979 to the Tangail District (to the north of the capital, Dhaka). The project&#x27;s services expanded to other districts of Bangladesh over the next few years.

Through an ordinance of the Bangladesh government dated 2 October 1983, the project was converted into the Grameen Bank. Bankers Ron Grzywinski and Mary Houghton, of ShoreBank, a community development bank in Chicago, helped Yunus incorporate the bank under a grant from the Ford Foundation. The bank&#x27;s repayment rate suffered from economic disruption following the 1998 flood in Bangladesh, but it recovered in subsequent years. By the beginning of 2005, the bank had loaned over US$4.7 billion and by the end of 2008, $7.6 billion to the poor.

In 2011, the Bangladesh government forced Yunus to resign from Grameen Bank, saying that at age 72, he was years beyond the legal limit for the position.

Grameen Bank soon began expanding into wealthy countries. As of 2017, Grameen America had 19 branches in eleven US cities, and its nearly 100,000 borrowers were all women. 

As of January 2025, a proposed ordinance aims to reduce the government’s stake in Grameen Bank from 25% to 5%, while amending the Grameen Bank Act of 2013. The changes would lower the number of government-appointed directors from three to one and shift the election of the chairman from the government to the 12-member board. These measures seek to restore the bank’s governance to its pre-2011 framework, increasing control for microcredit borrowers and decreasing state involvement.

==Funding==

&quot;The bank has gained its funding from different sources, and the main contributors have shifted over time.&quot; In the initial years, donor agencies used to provide the bulk of capital at low rates. By the mid-1990s, the bank started to get most of its funding from the central bank of Bangladesh. More recently, Grameen has started bond sales as a source of finance. The bonds are implicitly subsidised, as they are guaranteed by the Government of Bangladesh, and still they are sold above the bank rate. In 2013, Bangladesh parliament passed &#x27;Grameen Bank Act,&#x27; which replaces the Grameen Bank Ordinance, 1983, authorising the government to make rules for any aspect of the running of the bank.

== Donations ==
In 2016, Grameen America donated between $100,000 and $250,000, while Grameen Research, another Grameen arm, donated between $25,000 and $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation. When Muhammad Yunus was under investigation in Bangladesh over matters pertaining to oversight of a nonprofit bank, and had to resign from the bank&#x27;s board, he also reportedly wrote to the Clintons, requesting help from the &#x27;aides&#x27; on the matter. Yunus had to eventually step down as the managing director of Grameen Bank.

== Application of microcredit ==
Grameen Bank is founded on the principle that loans are better than charity, to interrupt poverty: they offer people the opportunity to take initiatives in business or agriculture, which provide earnings and enable them to pay off the debt.

The bank is founded on the belief that people have endless potential, and unleashing their creativity and initiative helps them end poverty.
Grameen has offered credit to classes of people formerly underserved: the poor, women, illiterate, and unemployed people. Access to credit is based on reasonable terms, such as the group lending system, and weekly-instalment payments, with reasonably long terms of loans, enabling the poor to build on their existing skills to earn better income in each cycle of loans.

Grameen&#x27;s objective has been to promote financial independence among the poor. Yunus encourages all borrowers to become savers, so that their local capital can be converted into new loans to others. Since 1995, Grameen has funded 90 percent of its loans with interest income and deposits collected, aligning the interests of its new borrowers and depositor-shareholders. Grameen converts deposits made in villages into loans for the more needy in the villages (Yunus and Jolis 1998).

It targets the poorest of the poor, with a particular emphasis on women, who receive upwards of 95 percent of the bank&#x27;s loans. Women traditionally had less access to financial alternatives of ordinary credit lines and incomes. They were seen to have an inequitable share of power in household decision making. Yunus and others have found that lending to women generates considerable secondary effects, including empowerment of a marginalised segment of society (Yunus and Jolis 1998), who share betterment of income with their children, unlike many men. Yunus claims that in 2004, women still have difficulty getting loans; they comprise less than 1 percent of borrowers from commercial banks (Yunus 2004). The interest rates charged by microfinance institutions, including Grameen Bank is high compared to that of traditional banks; Grameen&#x27;s interest (reducing balance basis) on its main credit product is about 20%.

Grameen has diversified the types of loans it makes. It supports hand-powered wells and loans to support the enterprises of Grameen members&#x27; immediate relatives. It has found that seasonal agricultural loans and lease-to-own agreements for equipment and livestock help the poor establish better agriculture. The bank has set a new goal: to make each of its branch locations free of poverty, as defined by benchmarks such as having adequate food and access to clean water and latrines.


Grameen Bank is known for its system of solidarity lending. The bank incorporates a set of values embodied in Bangladesh, by the &quot;Sixteen Decisions&quot; (updated to &quot;Eighteen Decisions&quot; in 2023). At every branch of Grameen Bank, the borrowers recite these Decisions, and vow to follow them. As a result of the Eighteen Decisions, Grameen borrowers are encouraged to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by sending them to school. Since the bank embraced the Sixteen Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This, in turn helps bring about social change, and educate the next generation.

Solidarity lending is a cornerstone of microcredit, and the system was used in more than 43 countries . Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.

No legal instrument (i.e. no written contract) is made between Grameen Bank and its borrowers; the system works based on trust. To supplement the lending, Grameen Bank requires the borrowing members to save very small amounts regularly in a number of funds, designated for emergency, the group, etc. These savings help serve as an insurance against contingencies.

In a country in which few women may take out loans from large commercial banks, Grameen has focused on women borrowers; around 97% of its members are women. While a World Bank study has concluded that women&#x27;s access to microcredit empowers them through greater access to resources and control over decision making, some other economists argue that the relationship between microcredit and women-empowerment is less straightforward.

In other areas, Grameen has had very high payback rates—over 98 percent. However, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, in 2001, a fifth of the bank&#x27;s loans were more than a year overdue. Grameen says that more than half of its borrowers in Bangladesh (close to 50 million) have risen out of acute poverty thanks to their loan, as measured by such standards as having all children of school age in school, all household members eating three meals a day, a sanitary toilet, a rainproof house, clean drinking water, and the ability to repay a 300 taka-a-week (around US$4) loan.

The bank is also engaged in social business and entrepreneurship fields. In 2009, the Grameen Creative Lab collaborated with the Yunus Centre to create the Global Social Business Summit. The meeting has become the main platform for social businesses worldwide to foster discussions, actions and collaborations to develop effective solutions to the most pressing problems plaguing the world.

===Village phone program===
The bank has diversified among different applications of microcredit. In the Village Phone program, women entrepreneurs can start businesses to provide wireless payphone service in rural areas. This program earned the bank the 2004 Petersburg Prize, worth EUR 100,000, for its contribution of Technology to Development. In the press release announcing the prize, the Development Gateway Foundation noted that through this program:

... Grameen has created a new class of women entrepreneurs who have raised themselves from poverty. Moreover, it has improved the livelihoods of farmers and others who are provided access to critical market information and lifeline communications previously unattainable in some 28,000 villages of Bangladesh. More than 55,000 phones are currently in operation, with more than 80 million people benefiting from access to market information, news from relatives, and more.

=== Struggling members program ===
In 2003, Grameen Bank started a new program, different from its traditional group-based lending, exclusively targeted to the beggars in Bangladesh. This program is focused on distributing small loans to beggars.

===Housing loans===

In 1984, Grameen applied to the Central Bank for help setting up a housing loan program for its borrowers. Their application was rejected on the grounds that the US$125 suggested loan could not possibly build a suitable living structure. So, Grameen instead proposed the idea of &quot;shelter loans&quot;. They were again rejected, this time on the grounds that their borrowers could not afford non-income generating loans. Grameen changed tactics and applied a third time, this time to make &quot;factory loans&quot;, the explanation being that borrowers worked from home, so the home was also a factory that made it possible for borrowers to earn income. Grameen was rejected for a third time.

After this third rejection, Yunus, the bank&#x27;s founder, met personally with the Central Bank governor to plead for their application. When asked if he thought the borrowers would repay the loans, he replied, &quot;Yes, they will. They do. Unlike the rich, the poor cannot risk not repaying. This is the only chance they have.&quot; Grameen was then allowed to add housing loans to their range of services.

As of 1999, Grameen made housing loans totalling $190 million to build over 560,000 homes with near-perfect repayment. By 1989, their average housing loan had grown to $300. That year, the Grameen housing program received the Aga Khan International Award for Architecture.

== Operational statistics ==
Grameen Bank is owned by the borrowers of the bank, most of whom are poor women. Initially, of the total equity of the bank, the government owned 60% in 1983. This then dropped over time to a single-digit percentage by the early 2010s. However, by the mid-2010s, this number increased again to 25%.

The bank grew significantly between 2003 and 2007. As of January 2022, the total borrowers of the bank number nearly 9.5 million, and 96.81% of those are women.
The number of borrowers has more than tripled since 2003, when the bank had 3.12 million members. Similar growth can be observed in the number of villages covered. As of October 2007, the Bank had a staff of more than 24,703 employees; its 2,468 branches provided services to 80,257 villages, up from the 43,681 villages covered in 2003. By the end of 2021, the bank&#x27;s coverage expanded to 81,678 villages out of the country&#x27;s total 87,223, for a national coverage rate of around 94%.

As of the end of 2021, cumulative loan disbursements since inception reached in excess of 2.5 trillion taka (US$33.767 billion), and the bank claims a loan recovery rate of around 95%. David Roodman has critiqued the accounting practices that Grameen used to determine this rate.

The global number of potential micro-borrowers is estimated to be 1 billion, with a total loan demand of $250 billion. The present microfinance model served 100 million people with $25 billion of loans as of the late 2000s.

==Staff training==

The Grameen Bank staff often work in difficult conditions. Employees receive 6 months of on-the-job training, while shadowing qualified and experienced individuals from various branches of Grameen. The goal of this training is for the trainee to &quot;appreciate the unexplored potential of the destitute&quot; and to discover new ways to solve problems that arise within the Grameen branch. After completing the 6-month period, trainees return to Dhaka headquarters for review and critique before appointment to a bank branch.

==Honours==
* In 1994, Grameen Bank received the Independence Day Award, which is the highest government award.
* 13 October 2006, the Nobel Committee awarded Grameen Bank and its founder, Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for their efforts to create economic and social development from below.&quot; The award announcement also mentions that:
From modest beginnings three decades ago, Yunus has, first and foremost through Grameen Bank, developed micro-credit into an ever more important instrument in the struggle against poverty. Grameen Bank has been a source of ideas and models for the many institutions in the field of micro-credit that have sprung up around the world.

On 10 December 2006, Mosammat Taslima Begum, who used her first 16 euro (US$20) loan from the bank in 1992 to buy a goat and subsequently became a successful entrepreneur and one of the elected board members of the bank, accepted the Nobel Prize on behalf of Grameen Bank&#x27;s investors and borrowers at the prize awarding ceremony held at Oslo City Hall.

Grameen Bank is the only business corporation to have won a Nobel Prize. Professor Ole Danbolt Mjøs, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, in his speech, said that, by giving the prize to Grameen Bank and Muhammad Yunus, the Norwegian Nobel Committee wanted to encourage attention on achievements of the Muslim world, on the women&#x27;s perspective, and on the fight against poverty.

Citizens of Bangladesh celebrated the prize. Some critics said that the award affirms neoliberalism.

The Grameen Bank has grown into over two dozen enterprises of the Grameen Family of Enterprises. These organisations include Grameen Trust, Grameen Fund, Grameen Communications, Grameen Shakti (Grameen Energy), Grameen Telecom, Grameen Shikkha (Grameen Education), Grameen Motsho (Grameen Fisheries), Grameen Baybosa Bikash (Grameen Business Development), Grameen Phone, Grameen Software Limited, Grameen CyberNet Limited, Grameen Knitwear Limited, and Grameen Uddog (owner of the brand Grameen Check).

On 11 July 2005, the Grameen Mutual Fund One (GMFO), approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Bangladesh, was listed as an initial public offering. One of the first mutual funds of its kind, GMFO will allow the more than four million Grameen bank members, as well as non-members, to buy into Bangladesh&#x27;s capital markets. The Bank and its constituents are together worth over US$7.4 billion.

The Grameen Foundation was developed to share the Grameen philosophy and expand the benefits of microfinance for the world&#x27;s poorest people. Grameen Foundation, which has an A-rating from [Charity Watch], provides microloans in the USA (the only developed country where this is done), and supports microfinance institutions worldwide with loan guarantees, training, and technology transfer. As of 2008, Grameen Foundation supports microfinance institutions in the following regions:
* Asia-Pacific: Bangladesh, China, East Timor, Indonesia, India, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Yemen
* Americas: Bolivia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Peru, United States
* Africa: Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tunisia, Uganda

From 2005, Grameen Bank worked on Mifos X, an open source technology framework for core banking solutions. Since 2011, Grameen Bank released this technology under the stewardship of Mifos Initiative, a US Non Profit organisation.

== Criticism ==
Some analysts have suggested that microcredit can bring communities into debt from which they cannot escape. Researchers have noted instances when microloans from the Grameen Bank were linked to exploitation and pressures on poor families to sell their belongings, leading in extreme cases to humiliation and ultimately suicides.

The Mises Institute&#x27;s Jeffrey Tucker suggests that microcredit banks depend on subsidies to operate, thus acting as another example of welfare. Yunus believes that he is working against the subsidised economy, giving borrowers the opportunity to create businesses. Some of Tucker&#x27;s criticism is based on his interpretation of Grameen&#x27;s &quot;16 decisions&quot;, seen as indoctrination, without considering what they mean in the context of poor, illiterate peasants.

The Norwegian documentary &quot;Caught in Micro Debt&quot; claims that Grameen evaded taxes. The Spanish documentary &quot;Microcredit&quot; also suggested this. The accusation is based on the unauthorised transfer of approximately US$100 million, donated by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad), from one Grameen entity to another in 1996, before the expiry of the Grameen Bank&#x27;s tax exemption. However, Norad published a statement in December 2010 clearing Yunus and the Bank of any wrongdoing on this point, following a comprehensive review of Norad&#x27;s support commissioned by the Minister of International Development.

Yunus denies that this is tax evasion:

David Roodman and Jonathan Morduch question the statistical validity of studies of microcredit&#x27;s effects on poverty, noting the complexity of the situations involved. Yoolim Lee and Ruth David discuss how microfinance and the Grameen model in South India have in recent years been distorted by venture capitalism and profit-makers. In some cases, poor rural families have suffered debt spirals, harassment by microfinance debt collectors, and in some cases suicide.

Peter Singer claims that microcredit has a limited ability to transform lives, and that other interventions are more effective.

<text>A xenolith (&quot;foreign rock&quot;) is a rock fragment (country rock) that becomes enveloped in a larger rock during the latter&#x27;s development and solidification. In geology, the term &quot;xenolith&quot; is almost exclusively used to describe inclusions in igneous rock entrained during magma ascent, emplacement and eruption. Xenoliths may be engulfed along the margins of a magma chamber, torn loose from the walls of an erupting lava conduit or explosive diatreme or picked up along the base of a flowing body of lava on the Earth&#x27;s surface. A xenocryst is an individual foreign crystal included within an igneous body. Examples of xenocrysts are quartz crystals in a silica-deficient lava and diamonds within kimberlite diatremes. Xenoliths can be non-uniform within individual locations, even in areas which are spatially limited, e.g. rhyolite-dominated lava of Niijima volcano (Japan) contains two types of gabbroic xenoliths which are of different origin - they were formed in different temperature and pressure conditions.

Although the term xenolith is most commonly associated with inclusions in igneous rocks, a broad definition could also include rock fragments which have become encased in sedimentary rock. Xenoliths have been found in some meteorites.

To be considered a true xenolith, the included rock must be identifiably different from the rock in which it is enveloped; an included rock of similar type is called an &quot;autolith&quot; or a cognate inclusion.

Xenoliths and xenocrysts provide important information about the composition of the otherwise inaccessible mantle. Basalts, kimberlites, lamproites and lamprophyres, which have their source in the upper mantle, often contain fragments and crystals assumed to be a part of the originating mantle mineralogy. Xenoliths of dunite, peridotite and spinel lherzolite in basaltic lava flows are one example. Kimberlites contain, in addition to diamond xenocrysts, fragments of lherzolites of varying composition. The aluminium-bearing minerals of these fragments provide clues to the depth of origin. Calcic plagioclase is stable to a depth of . Between and about , spinel is the stable aluminium phase. At depths greater than about 60 km, dense garnet becomes the aluminium-bearing mineral. Some kimberlites contain xenoliths of eclogite, which is considered to be the high-pressure metamorphic product of basaltic oceanic crust, as it descends into the mantle along subduction zones.

The large-scale inclusion of foreign rock strata at the margins of an igneous intrusion is called a &quot;roof pendant&quot;.

<text>The Battle of Kolombangara (Japanese: コロンバンガラ島沖海戦) (also known as the Second Battle of Kula Gulf) was a naval battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II, fought on the night of 12/13 July 1943, off the northeastern coast of Kolombangara in the Solomon Islands. The battle took place during the early stages of the New Georgia campaign when an Imperial Japanese Navy force, carrying reinforcements south to Vila, Solomon Islands, was intercepted by a task force of U.S. and New Zealand light cruisers and destroyers. In the ensuing action, the Japanese sank one Allied destroyer and damaged three cruisers. They were also able to successfully land 1,200 ground troops on the western coast of Kolombangara but lost one light cruiser sunk in the process.

==Background==
The Allied campaign in New Georgia had begun on 30 June 1943 as part of their advance through the central Solomon Islands towards Rabaul under the guise of Operation Cartwheel. In the initial phase of the operation, Rendova had been captured to provide a staging point for U.S. forces assigned to capture the Japanese airfield at Munda Point, which was one of the campaign&#x27;s key objectives. On 2 July, troops of the U.S. 43rd Infantry Division landed on New Georgia to attack Munda, while three days later a battalion of Marine Raiders and two U.S. Army battalions were landed at Rice Anchorage on New Georgia&#x27;s northern shore to seize Bairoko.

In response to the Allied landings, the Japanese sought to reinforce New Georgia to shore up the southern flank to their base around Rabaul. On the night of 12 July a Japanese &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; naval reinforcement force made a run down &quot;The Slot&quot; from Rabaul to land troops at Vila on Kolombangara by way of the Kula Gulf. This force was commanded by Rear Admiral (少将 &quot;shōshō&quot;) Shunji Isaki and consisted of the light cruiser , the destroyers , , , and , as well as the destroyer transports , , , and . These four ships carried 1,200 ground troops which were to be landed on Kolombangara as part of efforts to reinforce area in response to the Allied landings in New Georgia. The Japanese ships of Isaki&#x27;s force had been drawn from several different numbered elements, but the core was formed by Destroyer Squadron 2.

The movement of Japanese ships was detected by Allied coastwatchers and reported. In response, Admiral William Halsey ordered a naval task force to intercept the Japanese ships. The Allied naval force, designated Task Force 18, was commanded by Rear Admiral Walden L. Ainsworth. It consisted of two United States Navy light cruisers, and and the Royal New Zealand Navy light cruiser , and the destroyers , , , , , , , , , and .

In battle these Allied vessels deployed in a single column with five destroyers in the van followed by the light cruisers and then by five destroyers in the rear. Each group of five destroyers formed a squadron. The first of these, designated Destroyer Squadron 21, was commanded by Captain Francis X. McInerney. The second destroyer squadron was Captain Thomas J. Ryan&#x27;s Destroyer Squadron 12; it had only recently been assigned to Ainworth&#x27;s task force, as had the New Zealand cruiser which had been assigned to Ainsworth&#x27;s force following the loss of during the Battle of Kula Gulf on 6 July. Together, the three cruisers were grouped together as Cruiser Division 9. Ainsworth&#x27;s mission was to prevent Japanese troops and supplies from landing as part of efforts to stem the flow of reinforcements towards Munda.

==Battle==
The U.S. task force sailed from its base around Tulagi at 17:00 on 12 July, amidst clear skies and calm seas. Passing Savo Island, Ainsworth steered a course along the west coast of Santa Isabel Island, hoping to use it to hide his force from Japanese reconnaissance aircraft. His plan for the attack was to use the first squadron of five destroyers that formed his vanguard to fire torpedoes while his cruisers maneuvered into a position to use their main guns. After laying down a heavy barrage, the cruisers would maneuver again to avoid return torpedoes from the Japanese destroyers. Having gone to general quarters due to concerns about being spotted in the bright moonlight of the clear night sky, around midnight the U.S. task force altered course towards Visu Visu. They then increased their speed following reports from Allied reconnaissance aircraft that had spotted Isaki&#x27;s force about away. Hamstrung by their slowest ship, &quot;Leander&quot;, Ainsworth&#x27;s task group was only able to make while Isaki&#x27;s force was cruising at about .

As the skies began to grow overcast at 01:00 on 13 July, the Allied ships established radar contact about east of the northern tip of Kolombangara at . Ainsworth assumed he had a complete surprise as the Japanese lacked radar, but in reality the Japanese had been aware of the Allied force for almost two hours. Despite not possessing radar, the Japanese ships could detect the electro-magnetic impulses of the Allied radar systems, and from this the Japanese crews were able to gain an accurate plot of Ainsworth&#x27;s dispositions. After sighting the Japanese force at 01:03, the U.S. destroyers of McInerney&#x27;s squadron increased speed to engage the Japanese force with their torpedoes while the cruisers turned to deploy their main batteries and engage to starboard. Unknown to Ainsworth, the Japanese destroyers had already launched Long Lance torpedoes, which had a longer range than the Allied torpedoes. After firing their salvoes between 01:08 and 01:14, the Japanese destroyers turned away to regroup.

The first U.S. torpedoes hit the water about a minute after their Japanese counterparts, with &quot;Nicholas&quot; engaging &quot;Jintsū&quot; at a range of just under . &quot;Jintsū&quot; turned on her searchlight and engaged the Allied ships but was subjected to concentrated Allied fire from a range of around , with 2,630 rounds being fired under the direction of spotting aircraft overhead. After minor corrections to their fall of shot, the Japanese cruiser was heavily damaged. After losing steerage around 01:17, &quot;Jintsū&quot; came to a dead stop, was reduced to a wreck, broken in two by several torpedo hits, and sank at about 01:45, with the loss of nearly her entire crew including Isaki. On the Allied side, &quot;Leander&quot; was hit by a shell from &quot;Jintsū&quot;. The damage was light but severed radio communications. Several Japanese torpedoes were spotted, and the Allied ships began evasive action. These counter-maneuvers were hampered by faulty communications and thick gunsmoke that reduced visibility. Consequently, several ships turned wide to avoid collisions, including &quot;Leander&quot; which was struck by one of the Japanese torpedoes. Severely damaged, the New Zealand cruiser retired from the battle escorted by &quot;Radford&quot; and &quot;Jenkins&quot;.

Amidst the confusion of the initial battle, Ryan&#x27;s destroyer squadron began its torpedo run from a distance of , firing his first salvo around 01:12. McInerney&#x27;s destroyers, except &quot;Radford&quot; and &quot;Jenkins&quot;, were detached from the task force by Ainsworth at 01:31 to pursue contacts to the west following a reconnaissance report from the supporting aircraft that indicated several destroyers were withdrawing in that direction. Meanwhile, the four Japanese destroyer-transports began to withdraw along the coast, while the four Japanese escort destroyers temporarily retired north under the command of Captain Yoshima Shimai to use the cover of a rain squall to reload their torpedo tubes, doing so in only 18 minutes. Ainsworth then pursued the Japanese destroyers with Ryan&#x27;s destroyers and his own three cruisers, altering course to the northwest.

Radar contact was reestablished by the U.S. ships at 01:56, but there was uncertainty about the identity of the ships among Ainsworth&#x27;s advisers. Believing that they may have been McInerney&#x27;s destroyers, the U.S. ships initially held their fire while they sought to confirm the location of three detached destroyers. At 02:03, starshells were fired to illuminate the contacts that had begun to withdraw. Shortly afterward, Ainsworth deployed his ships to begin firing with their main batteries, maneuvering to starboard. In the process, they moved into the path of several torpedoes that had been fired by the Japanese destroyers before they had turned about. &quot;St. Louis&quot; and &quot;Honolulu&quot; were both struck by torpedoes and damaged, although this was not mortal. The destroyer &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; managed to reply with a salvo of four torpedoes, but these failed to hit anything. A minute later the destroyer &quot;Gwin&quot; was also struck by a torpedo amidships, inflicting heavy damage. Despite efforts to save the ship, &quot;Gwin&quot; was scuttled at 09:30. A total of 61 men were killed on &quot;Gwin&quot;. Its surviving crew were subsequently evacuated on &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Following the battle, Ainsworth&#x27;s force withdrew back to Tulagi. Sailing through The Slot in daylight risked air attack from the Japanese. As a result, Ainsworth requested air support, and a strong fighter force was provided from bases in the Russell Islands to cover the withdrawal. Early on 13 July, a force of 18 Japanese dive bombers, escorted by 20 fighters, was dispatched to attack the Allied ships, but they were turned back after clashing off Visu Visu.

Except for &quot;Jintsū&quot;, which went down with 482 men, the Japanese force escaped damage. After withdrawing along the coast, the four destroyer transports had diverted through the Vella Gulf and successfully landed 1,200 men at Sandfly Harbor on the western coast of Kolombangara. They completed unloading at 03:40 after which the Japanese ships searched for survivors from &quot;Jintsū&quot; and then returned to Buin. A total of 21 survivors from &quot;Jintsū&quot; were subsequently rescued by ; a few others were rescued by American ships. Allied losses amounted to one destroyer sunk and three light cruisers damaged, one heavily. A total of 89 Allied sailors were killed, including 28 New Zealanders from &quot;Leander&quot;. &quot;Honolulu&quot; and &quot;St. Louis&quot; were out of action for several months while &quot;Leander&quot; was under repair for a year and never returned to action during World War II.

The Japanese had won a tactical victory and had demonstrated that they possessed superior night-fighting techniques, but of the action the naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison writes: &quot;A string of such victories add[ed] up to defeat.&quot; Paul Dull further describes the battle as one in a &quot;series of Pyrrhic victories for the Japanese&quot; as they were unable to match the capacity of U.S. industry to replace their losses. Ainsworth&#x27;s force was unable to prevent the flow of Japanese reinforcements south as the lines between Bairoko and the Diamond Narrows remained open. Nevertheless, strategically the battle forced a change in Japanese tactics. Combined with the earlier Battle of Kula Gulf, the engagement deterred the Japanese from future use of the Kula Gulf to reinforce Munda. The Allied naval commander, Admiral Chester Nimitz, also changed tactics, deciding that the use of cruisers in the confined waters around the Solomon Islands was too dangerous and ineffective. Meanwhile, for the Japanese destroyer losses necessitated the use of &quot;Daihatsu&quot; barges to move reinforcements between the Shortland Islands and the Kula Gulf. Consequently, the U.S. Navy concentrated responsibility for its interdiction efforts on its destroyer force and PT boats.

Throughout July and into early August, a series of nightly actions took place involving by U.S. destroyers, PT boats and aircraft against the Japanese reinforcement efforts. The most significant action during this time came on the night of 19/20 July, when a force of 11 ships, consisting of cruisers and destroyers under Rear Admiral Shoji Nishimura, was detected by U.S. aircraft in The Slot. At least one destroyer, &quot;Yugure&quot;, was sunk, and the cruiser was damaged, while four U.S. aircraft were lost. After this, the Japanese chose to use the Vella Gulf and the Blackett Strait along the western coast of Kolombangara rather than the direct route through the Kula Gulf. This resulted in the Battle of Vella Gulf and Battle off Horaniu in early August. In late September and early October, the Japanese began evacuating their ground troops from Kolombangara. A series of interdiction actions took place during which the U.S. Navy claimed to have sunk 46 barges, killing thousands of Japanese troops. Another action was fought between Japanese and U.S. destroyers off Kolombangara on the night of 2–3 October during which both sides ineffectively exchanged torpedoes and gunfire.

<text>The Battle of Kula Gulf (Japanese: クラ湾夜戦) took place in the early hours of 6 July 1943 during World War II. The battle involved United States and Japanese ships off the eastern coast of Kolombangara in the Solomon Islands. It took place during the early stages of the New Georgia campaign when a Japanese force landing reinforcements at Vila was intercepted by a force of US Navy cruisers and destroyers. One US light cruiser was sunk during the engagement while two Japanese destroyers were sunk and two more were damaged. The Japanese withdrew after the engagement, having landed 1,600 troops.

==Background==

In mid-1943, in the wake of the Guadalcanal campaign, the Allies launched their next offensive in the Solomon Islands, landing troops on the island of Rendova on 30 June as a preliminary step to seizing the major Japanese airstrip at Munda on New Georgia. The US landings on Rendova took place to set up an initial beachhead from which to move troops across Blanche Channel to New Georgia. After Rendova had been secured, the move to Zanana on the mainland took place on 2 July, after which US forces began the westward advance on Munda. In order to support this effort and to cut off Japanese reinforcements from moving down the Munda trail from Bairoko, the Allies decided to land a force on the north shore of New Georgia on 5 July. Meanwhile, the Japanese sought to reinforce the Munda area, moving troops and supplies via barge from the Shortlands, via Kolombangara.

The night before the battle in the Kula Gulf, Rear Admiral Walden L. Ainsworth&#x27;s Task Group 36.1 (TG 36.1) conducted a cruiser bombardment of Vila on Kolombangara Island and Bairoko. This operation was undertaken to support a landing at Rice Anchorage on the northern shore of New Georgia, by U.S. Marine and U.S. Army troops tasked with capturing Enogai and Bairoko.

At the same time as the Marines were landing at Rice Anchorage, two U.S. Navy destroyers, and , entered Bairoko Harbor to provide naval gunfire support. In the early hours of the morning a Type 93 torpedo hit &quot;Strong&quot; on her port side aft, resulting in the loss of the destroyer. A total of 241 survivors were rescued by &quot;Chevalier&quot; while &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; attempted to return fire; 46 U.S. sailors lost their lives during the attack. The torpedo came from a salvo of 14 torpedoes fired by a group of four Japanese destroyers, led by , traveled a distance of , and is believed to be the longest successful torpedo attack of the war. After firing their torpedoes the Japanese destroyers departed the area without being detected. Such was the distance of the shot, the U.S. commander believed that his force had been attacked by a Japanese submarine.

==Battle==
Ainsworth&#x27;s task group consisted of the light cruisers , , and , plus four destroyers, , , and . On the afternoon of 5 July, they were returning to the Coral Sea to resupply when Admiral William Halsey was informed of another &quot;Tokyo Express&quot; mission down &quot;the Slot&quot; in the Solomon Islands, from Buin, on Bougainville. Ordered to intercept the Japanese, Ainsworth changed course, and proceeded northwest past New Georgia Island. &quot;Chevalier&quot; had been damaged picking up survivors from &quot;Strong&quot;, and left the area; they were replaced by &quot;Radford&quot; and &quot;Jenkins&quot;, who left Tulagi at 16:47 hours and 18:37 hours on 5 July respectively, after replenishing.

The American ships passed Visu Visu Point, on the northwest coast of New Georgia, just after midnight on 6 July. About an hour later, Ainsworth&#x27;s task force was off the east coast of Kolombangara, about half a mile from Visu Visu Point, and roughly northeast of Waugh Rock, when they came into contact with a Japanese naval reinforcement group consisting of two transport units carrying troops, escorted by a support unit, under Admiral Teruo Akiyama. The Japanese force consisted of ten ships in total, all of which were destroyers. The support unit was made up of three ships from the 3rd Destroyer Squadron, while the first transport unit (designated the 30th Transport Division) was made up of three destroyers, and the second transport unit (designated the 11th Transport Division) consisted of four destroyers.

The Japanese ships were carrying 2,600 ground troops and were bound for Vila, which was being used as a staging point for moving reinforcements to Munda. When the battle began, Akiyama&#x27;s force was divided into two parts: the three escorts of the support unit (&quot;Niizuki&quot;, and ) trailing the main column consisting of the four ships from the second transport unit (, , and ). Meanwhile, the three ships of the first transport unit, , and , were unloading at Vila, about away.

The escorts of the Japanese support unit were the first to be engaged. The U.S. ships, having tracked their opponents with radar, opened fire at 01:57 hours, firing 612 shells in 21 minutes and six seconds, quickly sinking the destroyer &quot;Niizuki&quot; and killing Admiral Akiyama. However, &quot;Helena&quot; had expended all of her flashless powder the previous night, and she was forced to use smokeless powder, thus illuminating herself to the Japanese ships with every salvo. Two of the Japanese destroyers launched their Long Lance torpedoes and hit &quot;Helena&quot;, fatally damaging her. After heading away from Vila following first contact, the main Japanese force broke away behind a smokescreen. In the process, was hit by a single 6-inch shell, and ran aground near Bambari Harbor, on Kolombangara, north of Vila, while was damaged slightly by two shells, which failed to explode.

Around 03:30 hours, Ainsworth began retiring towards Tulagi, while the Japanese headed for Buin. Two American destroyers, &quot;Radford&quot; and &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot;, remained behind to rescue survivors, as did the Japanese destroyer, . At about 05:00, &quot;Amagiri&quot; and &quot;Nicholas&quot; exchanged torpedoes and gunfire; hit four times, &quot;Amagiri&quot; withdrew. The beached &quot;Nagatsuki&quot; was abandoned by her crew in the morning, and was later bombed and destroyed by American aircraft. &quot;Mikazuki&quot; and &quot;Hamakaze&quot; completed unloading, and departed through the Blackett Strait, while &quot;Mochizuki&quot; lingered for another hour before leaving through the Kula Gulf along the coast of Kolombangara, clashing briefly with &quot;Nicholas&quot;, around 06:15 before withdrawing behind a smoke screen.

==Aftermath==
US losses during the battle amounted to one light cruiser sunk and 168 killed, all of whom were from &quot;Helena&quot;, while the Japanese lost two destroyers sunk and two destroyers damaged, with 324 men killed. The breakdown of casualties for the Japanese by ship was as follows: &quot;Niizuki&quot; (300 killed), &quot;Amagiri&quot; (10 killed), &quot;Nagatsuki&quot; (eight killed and 13 wounded), and &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot; (six killed). The Japanese succeeded in landing 1,600 troops at Vila, as well as 90 tons of supplies. For his actions leading the column of cruisers at Kula Gulf and earlier in the campaign, Captain Robert W. Hayler of the &quot;Honolulu&quot; received his second Navy Cross.

The destroyers &quot;Radford&quot; and &quot;Nicholas&quot; returned to rescue survivors from &quot;Helena&quot;. While rescuing over 750 men, &quot;Radford&quot; and &quot;Nicholas&quot; had to reengage the Japanese three times; they were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for their rescue. &quot;Amagiri&quot; escaped and later rammed and cut in half the motor torpedo boat , captained by future President of the United States John F. Kennedy (1917–1963), in the Blackett Strait, southwest of Kolombangara on 2 August. &quot;Hatsuyuki&quot; and &quot;Satsuki&quot; returned to Buin via the Blackett Strait.

Following the engagement in the Kula Gulf, the Japanese continued to move reinforcements south to New Georgia. On 9 July, 1,200 troops were moved to Kolombangara successfully without opposition. Another effort on 12/13 July, however, resulted in the Battle of Kolombangara. Meanwhile, ashore, US troops had secured Enogai on the northwestern coast on 10–11 July, while around Munda the Japanese stubbornly resisted US efforts to advance towards the airfield, which stalled and was eventually halted by a Japanese counterattack on 17 July.

==Namesake==
The U.S. Navy escort aircraft carrier —in commission from 1945–1946, 1951–1955, and 1965–1969—was named for this battle.

<doc id="545547" wikidata="Q6275135" url="?curid=545547" title="Jones Beach State Park">
<text>Jones Beach State Park (colloquially &quot;Jones Beach&quot;) is a state park in the U.S. state of New York. It is located in southern Nassau County on Jones Beach Island, a barrier island linked to Long Island by the Meadowbrook State Parkway, Wantagh State Parkway, and Ocean Parkway. The park was created during Robert Moses&#x27; administration as President of the Long Island State Park Commission as part of the development of parkways on Long Island.

The park, in length, is renowned for its beaches (which, excepting the beach on Zachs Bay, face the open Atlantic Ocean) and furnishes one of the most popular summer recreational locations for the New York metropolitan area. It is the most popular and heavily visited beach on the East Coast, with an estimated six million visitors per year.

Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater, an outdoor arena in the park, is a popular musical and concert venue. The park also includes a boardwalk. It once featured dining and catering facilities that were popular sites for private parties and weddings, though these have been shut down.

Jones Beach is named after Major Thomas Jones, a major in the Queens County militia in the 17th century, who established a whaling station on the outer beach near the site of the present park.

==History==
Jones Beach was Moses&#x27; first major public project, free from housing developments and private clubs, and instead is open for the general public. Several homes on High Hill Beach were barged further down the island to West Gilgo Beach to make room for the park.

When Moses&#x27; group first surveyed Jones Island, it was swampy and only above sea level; the island frequently became completely submerged during storms. To create the park, huge dredgers brought sand from the bay bottom, eventually raising the island to above sea level. Another problem that followed was the wind—the fine silver beach sand would blow horribly, making the workers miserable and making the use of the beach as a recreational facility unlikely. Moses sent landscape architects to other stable Long Island beaches, who reported that a beach grass (&quot;Ammophila breviligulata&quot;), whose roots grew sideways in search of water, held dunes in place, forming a barrier to the wind. In the summer of 1928, thousands of men worked on the beach planting the grass by hand.

Built in the 1920s, many of its buildings and facilities feature Art Deco architecture. In the center of a traffic circle that he planned as a terminus for the Wantagh State Parkway, Moses ordered the construction of an Italianate-style water tower to serve as a central feature of the park. Two large bathhouses are also prominent features within the park. After rejecting a number of submissions by architects for the bathhouses, Moses selected the designs of the young and relatively inexperienced Herbert Magoon. Moses also picked out building materials—Ohio Sandstone and Barbizon brick—two of the most expensive materials available.

The park opened to the public on August 4, 1929, along with the causeway that provided automobile access from the mainland of Long Island. The causeway was the first section in what was to become the Wantagh State Parkway. Unusually for the time, no carnival-style amusements were allowed in the park area.

Robert Moses used low clearances for the bridges over the Southern State Parkway, a major east-west route to Jones Beach. It was alleged by Robert Caro, author of the Moses biography &quot;The Power Broker&quot;, that this was done intentionally to prevent poor and minority people from accessing the beach by public bus. Even for earlier-built parkways in Westchester County that Moses used as inspiration, clearances are on average higher than on the Southern State.

Since 2004, Jones Beach has hosted the Bethpage Air Show during the last weekend of May (Memorial Day weekend). The air show is one of the largest in the United States, and was attended by 231,000 people in 2015.

On April 28, 2005, the park and many of its related causeways &amp; parkways were listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in a historic district known as the Jones Beach State Park, Causeway and Parkway System.

==Park features and facilities==

===Ocean and bay beachfronts===

The beach consists of of ocean beach frontage and of bay frontage.

===Buildings and entertainment facilities===
The primary buildings on the Jones Beach site are the two bathhouses (west and east) and the park&#x27;s large water tower, all built to Moses&#x27; specifications. The water tower, built in 1930 to resemble the bell tower of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice, underwent a $6.1 million restoration in 2010. Robert Moses&#x27; plan originally included two swimming pools available for public use at Jones Beach: The West Bath House pool and the East Bath House pool. While the West Bath House pool has remained open, budget constraints forced the closure of the East Bath House pool in 2009. As part of a $65 million refurbishment of the park announced in 2014, the West Bath House will receive $7 million in improvements; state officials have announced their desire to eventually rehabilitate the East Bath House as well.

Large mosaics on the Central Mall Walkway near the water tower were restored in 2015; the $177,000 mosaic restoration was part of a larger $65 million refurbishment of the park announced in 2014.

The park also includes the Jones Beach Boardwalk Bandshell, located near Parking Field 4, which offers live performances and free music.

There is a beach along Zachs Bay. north of the beach, overlooking Zachs Bay, is the 15,200-seat Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater, formerly known as the Jones Beach Marine Theater. This outdoor amphitheatre opened in June 1952.

===Restaurants and concessions===
There are multiple concession stands along the boardwalk in season. A few of the larger concessions stay open past the main summer season. Beach dining and catering facilities no longer exist at Jones Beach.

Jones Beach formerly featured The Boardwalk Cafe, a large restaurant with an expansive ocean view, built in 1966 and demolished in 2004 due to damage from erosion. It was intended to be replaced with a $40 million, 1,500-seat, restaurant/catering hall called &quot;Trump on the Ocean&quot;, to be operated by then-real estate mogul (and later, President) Donald Trump and catering impresario Steven Carl. The project was stalled for several years due to legal battles over permits required for the restaurant&#x27;s planned basement, and was eventually cancelled in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.

Restaurant, catering, and cafeteria/concession services have been redeveloped and re-opened.
Gatsby&#x27;s is a restaurant and catering event venue that opened in June of 2019 and has re-opened post covid.
The Boardwalk Cafe restaurant opened in 2018, and has also re-opened post covid.
They also have a boardwalk bar and cafeteria that have opened, and a small gelato stand.

===Parking fields===
Jones Beach&#x27;s West End originally featured two parking fields known as West End 1, which was closed permanently in 1992 and replaced by the Theodore Roosevelt Nature Center after lying abandoned for nearly a decade, and West End 2, which lies at the westernmost area of the state park adjacent to the jetty on Jones&#x27; Inlet. As of 2021 the Theodore Roosevelt Nature Center has been closed and replaced by the new Energy &amp; Nature center at West End 2. West End 2 is also currently a designated surfing area, which is open to stargazers and fishermen at night and bird watchers and other naturalists by day. The West End 2 beach was closed in April 2009 because of the state fiscal crisis. The West End 2 parking field along with the Field 1 are the two largest ocean front parking areas currently extant in the park. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a drive thru testing site was established in the West End 1 parking field, resulting in the area being closed to all recreational activity until further notice.

==Transportation==
Jones Beach is accessible by car, boat, bicycle, and in the summer season by bus. Most visitors arrive by car via the Meadowbrook State Parkway or the Wantagh State Parkway; the recreation area is also accessible via the Ocean Parkway. A significant portion of visitors take the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to Freeport and then the Nassau Inter-County Express&#x27;s (NICE) n88X bus to Jones Beach.

<text>James Batcheller Sumner (November 19, 1887 – August 12, 1955) was an American biochemist. He discovered that enzymes can be crystallized, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946 with John Howard Northrop and Wendell Meredith Stanley. He was also the first to prove that enzymes are proteins.

==Biography==
Sumner was born on November 19, 1887, in Canton, Massachusetts.

While hunting at age 17, Sumner was accidentally shot by a companion and as a result his left arm had to be amputated just below the elbow. He had been left-handed before the accident, after which he had to learn to do things with his right hand.

Sumner graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1910 where he was acquainted with prominent chemists Roger Adams, Farrington Daniels, Frank C. Whitmore, James Bryant Conant and Charles Loring Jackson. After a short period of working in the cotton knitting factory owned by his uncle, he accepted a teaching position at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick, Canada. For the year 1911-12 he worked as a teaching assistantship in chemistry at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

In 1912, he went to study biochemistry in Harvard Medical School and obtained his Ph.D. degree in 1914 with Otto Folin. He then worked as assistant professor of biochemistry at Cornell Medical School in Ithaca, NY.

Sumner married Cid Ricketts (born Bertha Louise Ricketts in Brookhaven, Mississippi) when she attended medical school at Cornell. They married on July 10, 1915, and had four children. They were divorced in 1930, but she kept her married name. Cid Ricketts Sumner went on to become an author, writing books that included &quot;Tammy Tell Me True&quot;, which was made into the movie &quot;Tammy and the Bachelor&quot;, and &quot;Quality&quot;, which became the movie &quot;Pinky&quot;. Cid Ricketts Sumner was murdered by their grandson, John R. Cutler, in 1970.

In 1931 Sumner married Agnes Lundkvist. In 1943 they divorced; later that year he married Mary Beyer, with whom he had two children.

==Research==
It was in 1917 at Cornell where Sumner began his research into isolating enzymes in pure form; a feat which had never been achieved before. The enzyme he worked with was urease, which he isolated from jack beans. Sumner&#x27;s work was unsuccessful for many years and many of his colleagues were doubtful, believing that what he was trying to achieve was impossible, but in 1926 he demonstrated that urease could be isolated and crystallized. He accomplished this by mixing purified urease with acetone and then chilling it; the chilled solution produced crystallized urease. He was also able to show by chemical tests that his pure urease was a protein. This was the first experimental proof that an enzyme is a protein, a controversial question at the time.

His successful research brought him to full professorship at Cornell in 1929. From 1924 on his laboratory was located on the second floor of the new dairy science building, Stocking Hall (today home to Food Science), at Cornell where he did his Nobel Prize–winning research. In 1937 he succeeded in isolating and crystallizing a second enzyme, catalase. By this time, John Howard Northrop of the Rockefeller Institute had obtained other crystalline enzymes by similar methods, starting with pepsin in 1929. It had become clear that Sumner had devised a general crystallization method for enzymes, and also that all enzymes are proteins.

==Honors and awards==
In 1937, he was given a Guggenheim Fellowship and he spent five months in Sweden working with Professor Theodor Svedberg. Also that year, he was awarded the Scheele Award in Stockholm.

Both Sumner and Northrop, along with Wendell M Stanley, shared the Nobel Prize in 1946 for crystallization of enzymes. In 1947 Sumner became the director of Cornell&#x27;s enzyme chemistry laboratory. Sumner was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1948. In 1949, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

==Death==
Sumner died at age 67 of cancer in Buffalo, New York on August 12, 1955.

<text>Service-learning is an educational approach that uses community service to meet both classroom learning objectives and societal needs. It has been used with students of all grades and stages. Projects based in communities are designed to apply classroom learning to create positive change in the community and often involve community organisations. Recent studies have proven its use in citizen coexistence as a strategy to foster intercultural coexistence in local communities, which is essential for successfully implementing socio-educational interventions.

Service learning combines experiential learning and community service.

== Definitions ==
According to Andrew Furco, service-learning &quot;occurs when there is a balance between learning goals and service outcomes.&quot; Other authors, including the National Youth Leadership Council, emphasize the same balance. Robert Sigmon conceives the variety of service-learning projects found on college campuses in terms of variations in that balance: i.e. whether learning goals or service goals are primary, secondary, of equal importance, or completely separate.

The student is also expected to learn by acting in the world and reflecting on the results of their action. As a process of learning, this has long-established theoretical and empirical bases. According to Barbara Jacoby, therefore, service-learning &quot;is based on the work of researchers and theorists on learning, including John Dewey, Jean Piaget, Kurt Lewin, Donald Schon, and David Kolb, who believe that people learn through combinations of action and reflection.&quot; Related areas of academic practice, such as Action Research and Reflective Practice, emphasize the relationship between learner and community, or researcher and researched, with a view to creating change beyond the school, rather than only creating knowledge.

==History==
The term &quot;service-learning&quot; originated in and spread from the US and is often discussed in the context of American colleges and schools. Much of its history is therefore American. 

=== In American education ===
In one early account, in the late 1960s federal monies were used for a service-learning internship model by the Southern Regional Education Board. By 1979 the same author claimed &quot;service learning&quot; was being used to describe a number of different volunteer actions and experiential education programs. From 1995 to 1997, 458 universities received grants from the Corporation for National Service under the &quot;Learn and Serve Higher Education&quot; scheme (see Learn and Serve America), helping create 3,000 new service-learning courses with an average of more than 60 students per course. In 1992, Maryland and the District of Columbia adopted statewide service-learning requirements for high school graduation. In 2014 The National Center for Learning and Civic Engagement surveyed all states for their service-learning policies. However, while service-learning was well-established in American higher education institutions by 2008, it was to be found in less than 30% of K–12 schools according to Furco and Root.

== Applications &amp; contexts ==
There are several documented models of service-learning, such as the &quot;Comprehensive Action Plan for Service Learning.&quot; There are variants that focus on particular elements or purposes, such as &quot;critical service learning&quot; which emphasizes political and social power relations in marginalized communities. Recent attention has been paid to online service-learning or eService-Learning.

Service-learning has been used in multiple academic and community contexts. For example, it has been used in and by native American and other potentially marginalized communities. And it has been used within academic specialisms, such as history, sociology, language-learning, and engineering. 

==Benefits==
The benefits of service-learning for the participating student are better-documented than the benefits to the communities in which the service occurs. 

===Students&#x27; development===

Students have reported developing personal leadership skills, skills in working with others, including greater interaction with faculty, and the development of more meaning and purpose in study. Academically, there is evidence of improved understanding of classroom studies, the application of theory, critical thinking and analysis. Other personal growth outcomes may include self-knowledge, spiritual growth, the reward of helping others, career benefits including careers in service, and changes in personal efficacy

Experience in communities may result in experience of different cultures. In one survey of service-learning students, &quot;57 percent reported that they had frequent chances to work with people from ethnic groups other than their own.&quot; Advocates of service-learning argue that this can help students learn to appreciate their shared humanity and more effectively serve a broader array of people.

=== Community development ===
Service-learning contributes to the presence of more volunteers, which enables community organizations to do more and to serve more clients. Students may supply specific skills they possess to benefit the organization, and can be a source of new ideas, energy, and enthusiasm. Through partnering with a college or university, a community organization can gain access to new knowledge and opportunities to connect with other organizations that have partnered with the same school. 

Service-learning may motivate individuals to become better citizens of their communities by cultivating civic and social responsibility, and through the development of personal relationships. A service-learning experience may be the catalyst in the life of a student to dive into the complexities of the social issues they have encountered and to seek to develop innovative solutions.

==Critiques==
Service-learning has been the subject of debate throughout its history. It has been criticized for not generating useful skills, nor meaningful cultural or community knowledge, nor doing much for the community itself, and instead mostly inculcating communitarian political ideologies in students and focusing on the student&#x27;s &quot;good deeds”. Without deeper critical reflection the effect may be to maintain, rather than subvert, systems of community oppression. &quot;Critical service-learning&quot; claims to address some of these issues (see Applications &amp; Contexts, above). 

It has also been described as &quot;a utopian vision&quot;. University policies that mandate service learning have been criticized as the imposition of intellectual conformity by means of identifying specific types of civic engagement as worthy community service and thus prescribing social and political perspectives, contrary to the ideal of the university as a site for the pursuit of truth through the free exchange of ideas.

The relationship between community and academy is an area of general critique. Communication with faculty is often inconsistent, so community organizations do not always understand their roles and the roles of the faculty in students&#x27; service projects. Some organizations&#x27; representatives have stated that faculty assigned students projects that were not allowed in their organization. And the small number of hours students are required to spend volunteering can cause problems for community organizations and their clients. Even research about service-learning is mostly done by scholars rather than community locals and organizations.

== Factors in effectiveness ==
Research into service-learning claims to have identified a number of factors that determine its effectiveness. These include:

* placement &quot;quality&quot; (level of student challenge, responsibility, activity and sense of positive involvement and instructor/supervisor feedback)
* team dynamics
* placement and program duration (long enough to have a developmental impact)
* quality of student reflection, often as activity (e.g. brainstorming) and/or in written form(e.g. journaling)

==Notable people==
Alexander Astin, founding director of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program and the Higher Education Research Institute, formed a Theory of Involvement which explains how student involvement in co-curricular activities positively affects college outcomes. Through a 1998 study of college seniors, Astin demonstrated that service greatly improves critical thinking skills.

Nadinne I. Cruz: works as an independent consultant. She gained enthusiasm for the cause of service learning through her work in the Philippines. Now, she is an advocate of service learning who argues that only a small portion of skills needed to address life&#x27;s problems can be learned through traditional academia. Other skills, such as courage, forgiveness, and stewarding the earth, must be learned elsewhere. Therefore, she recommends service learning and community engagement, which “offer learning with and from wise people, who teach by example.”

Andrew Furco: Associate Vice President for Public Engagement at the University of Minnesota and a professor. Furco has contributed a variety of literature to service learning, including two books: Service-Learning: The Essence of the Pedagogy and Service-Learning Through a Multidisciplinary Lens, which he co-authored with S. Billig. He gives five reasons engagement programs differ from engaged universities: “Engagement differs from outreach… is at the heart of the university’s identity… focuses on partnerships… is with, not to, for, or in communities… is about institutional transformation.”

James Kielsmeier: Founded the National Youth Leadership Council, a nonprofit that became the service-learning movement. Kielsmeier posits that service learning involves a change in how schools see young people: from “resource users, recipients, and victims” to “contributors, givers, and leaders.”

<text>Maud, Countess of Huntingdon ( 1074–1130) or Matilda, was Queen of Alba as the wife of King David I. She was the great-niece of William the Conqueror and the granddaughter of Earl Siward.

== Biography ==
Maud was the daughter of Waltheof, the Anglo-Saxon Earl of Huntingdon and Northampton, and his French wife Judith of Lens. Her father was the last of the major Anglo-Saxon earls to remain powerful after the Norman conquest of England in 1066, and the son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria. Her mother was the niece of William the Conqueror, which makes Maud his grand-niece. Through her ancestors the Counts of Boulogne, she was also a descendant of Alfred the Great and Charles the Bald and a cousin of Godfrey of Bouillon.

She was married to Simon de Senlis (or St Liz) in about 1090. Earlier, William had tried to get Maud&#x27;s mother, Judith, to marry Simon. He received the honour of Huntingdon (whose lands stretched across much of eastern England) probably in right of his wife from William Rufus before the end of the year 1090.

She had three known children by him:
* Matilda of St Liz (Maud) (d. 1140); she married Robert Fitz Richard of Tonbridge; she married secondly Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester.
* Simon II of St Liz (d. 1153)
* Saint Waltheof of Melrose ( 1100–1159/1160)

Her first husband died some time after 1111 and Maud next married David, the brother-in-law of Henry I of England, in 1113. Through the marriage, David gained control over his wife&#x27;s vast estates in England, in addition to his own lands in Cumbria and Strathclyde. They had four children (two sons and two daughters):
# Malcolm (born in 1113 or later, died young)
# Henry ( 1114–1152)
# Claricia (died unmarried)
# Hodierna (died young and unmarried)

In 1124, David became King of Scots. Maud&#x27;s two sons by different fathers, Simon and Henry, would later vie for the Earldom of Huntingdon.

She died in 1130 or 1131 and was buried at Scone Abbey in Perthshire, but she appears in a charter of dubious origin dated 1147.

==Depictions in fiction==
Maud of Huntingdon appears as a character in Elizabeth Chadwick&#x27;s novel &quot;The Winter Mantle&quot; (2003), as well as Alan Moore&#x27;s novel &quot;Voice of the Fire&quot; (1995) and Nigel Tranter&#x27;s novel &quot;David the Prince&quot; (1980).

<doc id="545572" wikidata="Q1035419" url="?curid=545572" title="Herbert Pell">
<text>Herbert Claiborne Pell Jr. (February 16, 1884 – July 17, 1961) was a United States representative from New York, U.S. Minister to Portugal, U.S. Minister to Hungary, and a creator and member of the United Nations War Crimes Commission.

A native of New York City and a member of the prominent and wealthy Lorillard and Claiborne families, Pell was educated at Connecticut&#x27;s Pomfret School and attended Harvard University, Columbia University, and New York University. Originally active in politics as a Progressive, he later became a Democrat. In 1918, Pell was elected to Congress, and he served from 1919 to 1921. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1920. Pell continued to remain active in politics, and was chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee from 1921 to 1926 and a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention. He served as vice chairman of the Democratic National Campaign Committee for the 1936 elections.

In 1937, Pell was appointed as Minister to Portugal, where he served from May 27, 1937, until February 11, 1941, when he was appointed Minister to Hungary. In December 1941, Pell received Hungary&#x27;s declaration of war against the United States, closed the embassy and returned to the United States. He formally resigned in November 1942. From 1942 to 1945, Pell was the United States representative on the United Nations War Crimes Commission. Pell was recognized as an internationalist on foreign policy and a progressive despite coming from the wealthy and conservative class, which tended to be isolationist. He was the leading American seeking to build awareness of the plight of European Jews in the 1930s and 1940s and prevent the Holocaust, and was able to aid in holding the perpetrators responsible as the principal U.S. sponsor of and U.S. representative of the War Crimes Commission.

Pell died in Munich, West Germany on July 17, 1961. His remains were cremated and scattered in the Atlantic Ocean at Beavertail in Jamestown, Rhode Island.

==Early life==
Pell was born in New York City on February 16, 1884. He was the elder son of two children born to Katherine Lorillard (née Kernochan) Pell (1858–1917) and Herbert Claiborne Pell (1853–1926). His younger brother was Clarence Cecil Pell (1885–1964). He was a great-grandson of U.S. Representative John Francis Hamtramck Claiborne, and great-great-grandnephew of William Charles Cole Claiborne and Nathaniel Herbert Claiborne. Through his mother and maternal grandparents, James Powell Kernochan and Catherine (née Lorillard) Kernochan, the daughter of Pierre Lorillard III, he inherited a share of the Lorillard Tobacco fortune. He was also a direct descendant of Wampage I, a Siwanoy chieftain, as reflected in a &quot;Congressional Record&quot; entry relating to his son Claiborne Pell.

Pell was educated at the Pomfret School, in Connecticut. He attended Harvard University, Columbia University, and New York University, but did not complete a degree.

==Career==
Pell&#x27;s political career began as a member of the Progressive committee of Orange County, New York (1912 to 1914). He was elected as a Democrat to the Sixty-sixth Congress (March 4, 1919 – March 3, 1921) and was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1920 to the Sixty-seventh Congress. He was chairman of the Democratic State committee from 1921 to 1926 and a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention. Pell was an occasional lecturer at Columbia University, Harvard University, and other colleges and universities. He also served on the advisory committee of Yenching University, later merged with Peking University.

In 1936 was vice chairman of the Democratic National Campaign Committee. Pell was appointed as Minister to Portugal, where he served from May 27, 1937, until February 11, 1941, when he was appointed Minister to Hungary. He was serving in Budapest on December 13, 1941, when he received the Hungarian declaration of war against the United States. He closed the legation in Budapest, returned to the U.S. on January 16, 1942, and submitted his resignation on November 30, 1942. He was United States representative on the United Nations War Crimes Commission from August 1943 to January 1945.

==Personal life==
In November 1915, he married Matilda Bigelow (1895–1972), daughter of Nelson Pendleton Bigelow. Before their divorce in March 1927, they were the parents of:

* Claiborne de Borda Pell (1918–2009), a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island who served for 36 years from 1961 until 1997.

In June 1927, Matilda married Hugo W. Koehler (1886–1941), a commander in the United States Navy who served as a naval and State Department special agent in Russia during its civil war in 1920. Two weeks later in Paris, Pell married Olive Bigelow Pell (1886–1980), the portraitist. Olive Bigelow was the daughter of Poultney Bigelow (1855–1954) and granddaughter of John Bigelow (1817–1911), the U.S. Ambassador to France under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.

Pell died on July 17, 1961, in Munich, West Germany at the age of 77, while touring Europe with his grandson, Herbert Pell III. His funeral was held at Trinity Church in Newport, Rhode Island where there is a memorial plaque in his honor. His ashes were committed to the ocean off Beavertail in Jamestown, Rhode Island.

===Descendants===
Pell was the great-grandfather of Herbert Claiborne Pell IV (b. 1981), a candidate for Governor of Rhode Island, who married two-time Olympic medalist Michelle Kwan (b. 1980).

===Honors and commemorations===

<text>An academic term (or simply term) is a portion of an academic year during which an educational institution holds classes. The schedules adopted vary widely. Common terms such as semester, trimester, and quarter are used to denote terms of specific durations. In most countries, the academic year begins in late summer or early autumn and ends during the following spring or summer.

== Description ==
An academic year is the time during which an educational institution holds classes. An academic term is a portion of the academic year. The schedules adopted vary widely.

=== Types ===
&quot;Semester&quot;, &quot;trimester&quot; and &quot;quarter&quot; are all types of academic terms (the last two being mainly confined to American English), each differentiated by their duration as described below:
* Semester () originally German, where it referred to a university session of six months, adopted into American usage in the early 19th century as a half-year term of typically 15 to 18 weeks. Used in the US and other countries to refer to the two main periods into which the academic year is divided at some universities.
* Trimester () used in the US and Canada to refer to one of the three terms into which the academic year is divided at some universities.
* Quarter () used in American English to refer to one of four terms into which the academic year is divided at some universities.

== Academic terms by country ==
In most countries, the academic year begins in late summer or early autumn and ends during the following spring or summer. In Northern Hemisphere countries, this means that the academic year lasts from August, September, or October to May, June, or July. In Southern Hemisphere countries, the academic year aligns with the calendar year, lasting from February or March to November or December. The summer may or may not be part of the term system.

=== Australia ===

In most of Australia, the primary and secondary school year lasts about 200 days, from late January or early February to early or mid-December, and is split into four terms:
* Term 1 starts in late January or early February and ends in late March or early April (often in close proximity to Easter).
* Term 2 starts in late April or early May and ends in late June or early July.
* Term 3 starts in mid-to-late July and ends mid-to-late September.
* Term 4 starts in early-to-mid October and ends typically in mid-to-late December.

Terms 4 &amp; 1 (rolled over) and 2 &amp; 3 are respectively usually deemed &#x27;summer&#x27; and &#x27;winter&#x27; respectively for purposes of sports participation and uniform standards. Australian states and territories vary their approach to Easter when determining the dates for the holiday at the end of Term 1.

The exact dates vary from year to year, as well as between states, and for public and private school. In Tasmania until and including 2012, the school year was split into three terms, the first one being the longest and including an extended Easter holiday (which was also the practice of mainland Australia until the mid-1980s). However, in 2013 Tasmania introduced a four-term year, to conform to the rest of the country. The exact start and finish date of the academic year varies between jurisdictions; in 2023 Queensland will start earliest on 23 January (the only jurisdiction to begin the academic year before Australia Day) and finish earliest on 8 December, while Tasmania will start latest on 8 February and finish latest on 21 December. There is typically a break of two weeks between each term, followed by a 1-2 month summer break after term 4 which ends just before Christmas. This occasionally varies in different jurisdictions/school systems (i.e. some independent schools have a break of three week between terms 1 &amp; 2 and between terms 3 &amp; 4). In the year 2000, due to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the state of New South Wales extended the break after Term 3 to three weeks.

Most Australian universities have two semesters a year, but Bond University, Deakin University, CQUniversity, Griffith University, the University of New South Wales and the University of Canberra have three trimesters. Unusually, Macquarie University officially uses the word &quot;session&quot; and CQUniversity uses the word &quot;term&quot; in place of &quot;semester&quot;. Many universities offer an optional short summer semester.

=== Austria ===

The Austrian school year for primary and secondary schools is split into two terms, the first one starts on the first Monday in September in the states of Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland and on the second Monday of September in Upper Austria, Salzburg, Styria, Carinthia, Tyrol and Vorarlberg. Most schools have holidays between the national holiday on October 26 and All Souls Day on November 2, but those are unofficial holidays not observed by all schools in Austria. Christmas holidays start on December 24 and end on the first weekday after January 6. The first term ends in Vienna and Lower Austria on the first Friday of February, in Burgenland, Carinthia, Salzburg, Tyrol and Vorarlberg on the second Friday of February and in Upper Austria and Styria on the third Friday of February.

There is a one-week break between the two terms. In the second term there are the Easter holidays, the Mayday Holiday on May 1 and the long weekends of Pentecost, Ascension and Corpus Christi. The school year ends in Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland on the last Friday of June, in Upper Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Salzburg, Tyrol and Vorarlberg on the first Friday in July.

=== Barbados ===

The Barbadian school year is fashioned after the British system, and as such, it follows a scheduling with three terms per school year.
* First term begins in the second week of September and continues for 15 weeks, ending in mid-December, excluding one week for mid-term break in late October.
* Second term begins in the first week of January and continues for 12 weeks, ending at the end of March.
* Third term begins early/mid-April and continues for 11 weeks until the end of June.
The long school holiday period is 9 to 10 weeks from the end of June until the first week of September.
=== Brazil ===

In Brazil, due to the Law of Directives and Bases of Brazilian Education, the academic year must have 200 days, both at schools and at universities. The school year usually begins during the first week of February. There is a 2-week/4-week long winter break in July. The Brazilian school year ends the first week of December, summer in Brazil.

Most schools use the 4 term system, called &quot;unidades&quot; or &quot;bimestres&quot; (&quot;units&quot;, &quot;bimesters&quot;), although there is a minority of schools that utilize a 3 term system instead, composed of trimesters (&quot;trimestres&quot;).

In Brazilian universities academic terms are defined as periods or semesters (&quot;período&quot;, &quot;semestre&quot;). There are two semesters: February to June and August to December. The majority of academic degrees courses are 8 semesters (four years) long or 10 semesters (five years) long.

=== Bangladesh ===

In Bangladesh, the kindergarten, elementary and schools follow the semester system. Most of the universities follow the semester system although for some particular subjects such as Law they follow a yearly system. Business schools of all public and private universities follow a semester or trimester system.

Some of the universities using a two-semester system (using &quot;Term 1&quot; and &quot;Term 2&quot; designations) include: Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology, Rajshahi University of Engineering and Technology, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh Agricultural University, Khulna University, Jagannath University, Jessore University of Science and Technology, International Islamic University Chittagong and Sylhet Agricultural University.

Some of the universities following a trimester system (using &quot;Spring&quot;, &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;Fall&quot; designations) include: Northern University Bangladesh, American International University - Bangladesh, BRAC University, Daffodil International University, East West University, Fareast International University, North South University, Presidency University, Prime University, Stamford University, Military Institute of Science and Technology, University of Information Technology and Sciences, University of Development Alternative (UODA), Bangladesh University of Business and Technology and United International University.

=== Belgium ===

In Belgium, kindergarten, elementary and secondary schools begin on September 1 and end on June 30.

Schools also take breaks/holidays:
* Autumn break: One week at the start of November
* Christmas break: Two weeks around Christmas and New Year
* Carnival break: One week in February.
* Easter break: Two weeks around Easter.
* Summer break: is always the break from 1 July until 31 August
* Ascension break: Thursday and Friday in early May to mid June
* Labor Day: May 1
* Whitsun: Monday in mid May to late June
* Armistice Day: November 11

Universities and colleges in Belgium use the semester system, dividing the academic year in two equal parts of fourteen weeks of courses. Universities start the first semester in the third week of September, and no &#x27;autumn break&#x27;. Colleges start one week earlier, in the second week of September, giving them right to the &#x27;autumn break&#x27; of one week. After 13 weeks of courses the &#x27;Christmas break&#x27; starts (around December 20), which is used to study for the 3–4 weeks of examinations in January.

After these examinations the universities have one week of vacation, the so-called &#x27;semestrial vacation&#x27;, while the colleges start the classes of the second semester at the end of January, immediately after the examinations, which week they reclaim with the &#x27;spring break&#x27; at the end of February, which the universities do not have. The universities start the second semester in the beginning of February.

Both universities and colleges have the &#x27;Easter break&#x27;, which again is used to study for the examinations in June. After Easter, the classes start again until the end of May, followed by four weeks of examinations in June, after which three months of vacation is given. The students who failed in passing some of the courses in their curriculum in January and June, the so-called &#x27;first session&#x27;, have to do the examinations again in the second session at the end of August.

=== Cambodia ===
In Cambodia the school year kindergarten sectors in public schools consists of 10 months with a two-month vacation, while in primary, and secondary sectors, it is divided into two semesters and each semester is divided into 2 quarters. The first of November is the start of the academic term. After the 1st semester, a small vacation when the school is halted and at the end of the Second Semester, a 2-month vacation until the start of the new year. In universities, it is divided into 4 years.

=== Canada ===

Education being a provincial responsibility, there is no Canadian national standard. In Canada, the school year for elementary and high school consists of 178 to 200 days, depending on the jurisdiction, but several days may be deducted from this total for professional development and administrative duties, resulting in approximately 187 teaching days per year for most jurisdictions. Elementary students receive approximately 950 hours of instruction and secondary students receive approximately 1000 hours per year.

Generally in English Canada, secondary schools run on a two-semester arrangement, also known as fall and spring semester, the first semester running from the day after Labour Day in September to January and the second running from February until the Thursday before the last Friday in June. The semesters are often divided into two terms each.

Some schools in Canada run on a trimester system, the first running from September to January, the second from January to March or April, and the third from March or April until June. The trimester is more common in elementary and middle schools (Kindergarten – Grade 8) than in high schools (Grade 9 – Grade 12). Most of those characteristics differ in Québec, where education is, with the exception of a few school boards, given in French. By tradition, Quebec and Franco-Ontarian elementary and secondary schools arrange timetables to ensure the school year ends before June 24, date of the St-Jean-Baptiste day celebration, a traditional holiday.

Most universities and colleges usually run from early September until the end of April or early May. Often, this winter session is split into two terms running September to December and January to April. Various forms of summer studies may be offered May to August. Some, such as University of Waterloo and Simon Fraser University, run a full tri-semester system, providing full courses during summer. There are a few school boards in Canada experimenting with year-round schooling.

=== Chile ===

In elementary school, high school, as well as in universities, Chilean education is divided into two semesters. The first one starts early March and lasts until late June and the second starts in early August and finishes in mid-December; also, some universities offer a summer period from early January to mid-February but just for exceptional courses.
These semesters have breaks for public festivities, such as Easter, independence commemoration (from two days to two weeks in September depending on year and place) and some public holidays like labour day, among others.

=== China ===
In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, elementary, middle and high schools from the public education have two semesters, the first from September to January, and the second from February or March, depending on the date of Chinese New Year, to July.

Most universities and colleges in China also uses the two-semesters system, while a small portion of Chinese universities, such as Shanghai University, are experimenting with the quarter system.

From January to February or March is the Winter break or Lunar New Year break. Summer break is normally from July to the end of August.

In Northern China, the winter break is longer and the summer break is shorter; the opposite applies in Southern China.

There are some casual holiday breaks:
* New year holiday: from 1 Jan. to 3 Jan.
* Lunar New year holiday: In Jan. or Feb. It lasts for around four weeks.
* Qingming Festival: Set according to the solar term. Usually on April 4 or 5.
* Labor&#x27;s Day: 1 May to 3 May.
* Dragon Boat Festival: Set according to Lunar Calendar. Usually about May and June.
* Mid-autumn Festival: Set according to Lunar Calendar. Usually about middle of September.
* National Day: From 1st Oct. to 7 Oct for Chinese students.

=== Costa Rica ===
In Costa Rica the school year runs for ten months. It starts in the first week of February and ends in the last week of November. There is a mid-term vacation of approximately 2 weeks in July, and most schools also observe &quot;Easter Week&quot; in March or April.

=== Czech Republic ===

In the elementary and high schools in the Czech Republic, the school year usually runs from September 1 to June 30 of the following year.

It is divided into two semesters with breaks on public holidays such as St. Vaclav (September 28), Independence day (October 28, two days break), Velvet Revolution (November 17), Christmas (9–12 days break), Spring break (1 week break), Easter (three days break on Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Monday) and finally Labour day (May 1) and Liberation day (May 8). After the end of school year on June 30, the Summer holidays follow until September 1 when a new school year starts. Sole exception to this is the final year at high schools, which ends with Graduation of students at the end of May.

Universities have two mid-terms. The academic year starts usually in the second half of September or in the beginning of October. (It depends on university.)
Bachelor&#x27;s degree is normally obtained by students after 3 years and masters after another 2 years of study. Still, there are some exceptions (e.g. medicine takes 6 years, no bachelor&#x27;s degree).

=== Denmark ===

In schools in Denmark, the school year runs from August to June. In universities, the academic year runs from around September 1 to June 30, and is often divided into an autumn semester (with January set aside for exams) and a spring semester (with June set aside for exams). Since 2004, some Danish universities and faculties divide the academic year into four quarters, each of which may consist of eight weeks and an exam week, and being separated from the next quarter by a one-week break.

=== Estonia ===

In Estonia, elementary and high schools begin on 1 September and end in the beginning of June. The school year is divided into trimesters (or quarters) that last about three months. Summer is usually counted as a term break, although the beginning of June is still part of the third trimester. Universities start on the first Monday of September and usually end in the middle of May or in the beginning of June; though in reality, exam periods may continue until the end of June (e.g. University of Tartu).

=== Ethiopia ===

In Ethiopia, almost all elementary, secondary, and college classes are conducted on a two-semester timetable. The first semester of the year is from September to late January or mid February. The second semester usually begins some two weeks after the end of the first and ends in late May or mid June.

=== Finland ===

In the elementary and secondary schools and college, the academic year is divided in semesters. The autumn semester begins in mid-August and is suspended a few days before Christmas. The classes continue after the Epiphany with the spring semester which finishes at the beginning of June.

=== France ===

In primary and secondary schools, the school year begins the first Monday of September, unless September 1 is on Sunday. The school year is divided into three trimesters. The first from September to December, the second from January to March, and the third is from April to June.

Breaks are scattered throughout the school year every 6, 7 or 8 weeks and last 2 weeks each:

* All Saint Break The first break is around All Saints&#x27; Day on November 1.
* Christmas Break Christmas Break starts the Saturday before Christmas.
* Winter Break Winter Break dates differ of the Academia&#x27;s location, which could be in Zone A, B, or C, to avoid high traffic on the road. It usually starts in February, ends late February or early March.
* Easter Break Easter Break depends on the location of Academia. It starts in April, and ends late April or early May.
* End of Academic term - Summer Break In primary school, end of Academic term is early July. In secondary school (middle school or high school) end of Academic term is before Middle School Exam in late June, or Baccalaureat, in mid-June.

On Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, pupils have a full day of teaching from around 8:30 a.m. until around 4:30 p.m. On Wednesday mornings, some pupils may have supplementary classes. French pupils used to attend school on Saturdays, but the so-called &quot;four-days week&quot; has been implemented since September 2008, reducing the teaching year from 936 to 864 hours (above the European average of 800 hours, but below the UK minimum of 950 hours for state schools). Additional holidays include Veterans Day on November 11, May 8, Ascension Day, May Day on May 1, and Easter Monday.

=== Germany ===
==== Schools in Germany ====
The school year in Germany begins between late July and early September, and ends from mid-June to July, with a summer break of similar length to that in the UK (only 6 weeks) but much shorter than in some other countries (with up to 3 months). The summer vacation starts in a different week by state (there are 16 federal states including Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen). The school year includes five shorter breaks or holidays:

Due to Germany&#x27;s federal structure, all breaks may differ depending on the state. The exact dates for the beginning and the end of school breaks are kept different state by state and changed every year. This is meant to keep holiday traffic as low as possible.

The school year is divided into two parts (September to February &amp; February to July). There is not necessarily any break between those two parts, but pupils get a semi-year school report (it only displays their current level and is not relevant for promotion).

==== Universities in Germany ====
German universities run two semesters with the start and end dates depending on the university. The &quot;Wintersemester&quot; (WiSe or WS), during which most students start university, often goes from 1 October until 31 March, with lectures starting around 15 October and lasting 14 weeks. There is usually a two-week break around Christmas and New Year (which is not counted in the 14 weeks). The &quot;Sommersemester&quot; (SoSe or SS) consequently usually goes from 1 April until 30 September with lectures starting some time after Easter and lasting 12 weeks. The two lecture-free periods of 12 to 14 weeks between the semesters are for taking exams, doing internships, lab courses, and employment.

The University of Mannheim changed its schedule to conform with US standards in Fall of 2006. The semesters there are now from August 1 to January 31 (&quot;Herbst-/Wintersemester&quot;) and from February 1 to July 31 (&quot;&quot;).

===== Universities of applied sciences =====
&quot;Fachhochschulen&quot; start both semesters one month earlier than other universities.

===== Vocational-cooperative universities =====
&quot;&quot; have four quarters, January to March and so on. In alternating quarters, the students attend the university and intern at the employer (the latter being the &quot;Praxisphase&quot;). The number of lessons per week is significantly higher than at normal universities (equivalent to a full-time job) and the exams cannot be during the &quot;free time&quot; of the year, as that time is spent in the company. Vacation is given according to labor laws, i.e. half of 20–30 days (because only half of the year is worked).

=== Guyana ===

The school year in Guyana usually begins in September and ends in July of the following year. It has three terms: Christmas (First), Easter (Second) and August (Third), with two to three weeks break for Christmas and Easter and 6 to 7 weeks during the August term.

=== Honduras ===
The school year in Honduras runs from the first week of February to the end of November, with a one-week break during Easter, and a week break in October. Depending on the university, some do trimester and others in quarters. Breaks may vary.

=== Hong Kong ===

In Hong Kong, the academic year usually runs from September 1 to mid-July for most primary and secondary schools. For senior secondary student, they usually start their academic year from mid of August or late August. Some secondary schools have two terms, but most have three terms. For universities and other tertiary institutions the academic year usually runs from September or October to April or May, sometimes with an extra summer term roughly from May to July.

Kindergartens often operate a semester (two-term) system, divided by the lengthy (e.g. two-week) break for Chinese New Year, typically in early February.

=== Hungary ===

In the elementary and high schools in Hungary, the school year usually runs from September 1 to June 15 of the next year, with variation if these dates fall on Saturday or Sunday. The school year &quot;(tanév)&quot; is usually split into two semesters &quot;(félév)&quot;. These semesters are also divided, with some schools holding examinations each half-semester. The first semester runs from September 1 until the middle of January and is divided by the fall vacation, which is around All Saints&#x27; Day and lasts for a week. The second semester is closed at the end of the school year. It is divided by the Easter holiday, which usually consist of the weekend before Easter and the holiday itself. Apart from these vacations and national celebrations, a few schools have &#x27;skiing holidays&#x27; &quot;(síszünet)&quot;, the date of which varies from the middle of January until February, though some schools hold it in December. Its length also varies from one school to another. It is made so that the students of the school who partake in the skiing camp of the school need no verification of absence. In the last school year of secondary education, the Matura examinations (school-leaving exam and entrance exam for university admissions; similar to A-level exams in the UK) are administered from May through July.

Hungarian universities run two semesters. They are typically from the first or second week of September to the middle of December (fall semester (őszi félév)) and from February to the middle of May (spring semester (tavaszi félév)). Both semesters are followed by an examination period. During the winter exam period, a break of 1–2 weeks is administered between Christmas and the beginning of the new year. In addition to the break between the semesters in summer, there is typically a break including Christmas and New Year. Some universities also have a fall and an Easter vacation.

=== India ===

In elementary and secondary schools, the academic year in some part is April to March and others June to May. The summer vacations start from the beginning of May and last up to the middle or end of June. There is also a winter vacation of 1–2 weeks at the beginning of the year. However, in the Eastern and southern states like West Bengal and Karnataka there will be two breaks, one for Dussehra or Diwali in October which ranges from 7 to 15 days and another for Christmas and New Year in late December and early January which ranges from 7 to 15 days. The entire academic year lasts for around 30 weeks.

A semester system is being implemented in most of the universities in India as directed by the University Grants Commission. In universities the academic year is from July to May. There is a mid-year break during summer, usually from the end of May to the start of July. Some universities also have an autumn break or Diwali break around October/November. This is generally right before the second semester exam in November or in the middle of the second semester.

All students move from old to the new academic year after the completion of the final examinations for the previous year with a small break of 1–3 weeks for compilation of results.

=== Indonesia ===

An academic year in Indonesia is divided to two terms, running from mid-July to December and January to mid-June. For universities, however, the terms are much shorter, running from September to December and February to May. Some universities provide a summer semester (called &quot;the short semester&quot;) from June to August. During president Abdurrahman Wahid&#x27;s term, schools are closed for Ramadan and a week after Eid-ul-Fitr (Idul Fitri). Some schools implement Saturday-off. Previously, academic year starts from January to December, but this rule changed in 1985.

=== Iran ===

In Iran, the academic year runs from September to June (10 months). Some universities, however, offer a limited number of courses in summer. Students have a three-month summer vacation. All schools are closed during Nowruz from march 20 until the beginning of April to celebrate the Iranian new year. The first (fall) semester begins on the first day of the Persian Calendar month of Mehr equivalent to the first day of autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and ends in January. The second (spring) semester begins in the winter and ends in June. No mid-term break exists in the academic calendar.

=== Republic of Ireland ===

The primary school year runs from the beginning of September until the end of June. There are two two-week long breaks for Christmas and Easter and two mid-term breaks at the end of October and mid-February, both one week long. Secondary schools run from September to the end of May, but due to the Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate exams, 3rd and 6th years respectively break at the end of June for summer holidays upon completion of the exams which end in the 3rd week of June.
The academic year for schools in receipt of public funding lasts for a minimum of 167 teaching days in secondary schools and 183 days in primary schools.

Third-level institutions generally from early September to December for their first term. The second term usually runs from January to Easter and the third term from Easter to mid- or late May. There are two common approaches to organising semesters: One, e.g. at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) and NUI Galway, is to align the first semester with the first term (Michaelmas at TCD) and then split the second semester over the second term (Hilary at TCD) and third term (Trinity at TCD). The other approach, e.g. at University College Dublin, is for the first semester to start at the start of the first term and continue after Christmas for a few weeks of the second term and for the second semester to start immediately after this in the middle of the second term, without a break, run through the rest of the second term, and continue after Easter through to the end of the third term.

=== Israel ===
==== Public education in Israel ====
The school year in Israel starts in elementary, middle, and high schools on September 1, and lasts until the end of June for elementary schools, and until June 20 for middle and high schools. There are no fixed holidays of equal length, with breaks occurring on national holidays, usually lasting two or three days. For Jews, there is a nine-day break for Sukkot (autumn); a seven-day break for Hannukah (in December); and for Passover (spring) the break is 2–3 weeks long. For the Muslim population, breaks are taken for Eid al-Adha, Eid ul-Fitr and end of semester breaks.

The university academic year typically divides into two semesters which start after Sukkot (typically mid to late October) and end in June or July. Some academic institutions also enable a third semester in the summer.

The short breaks:
* Eid ul-Fitr: the end of Ramadan, three- to five-day break, according to the lunar calendar (only in Islamic schools).
* Eid al-Adha: the end of Hajj, four-day break, according to the lunar calendar (only in Islamic schools).
* Rosh Hashanah: three-day break; the break is sometime between September 4 and October 6.
* Yom Kippur: two-day break; the break is sometime between September 13 and October 15. (see note below from 2012).
* Sukkot: nine-day break in late September or in October.
* Purim: three-day break, the break in late February or early March.
* Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut: one-day break, the break in late April or early May. The previous day, Yom Hazikaron, is a half day.
* Lag BaOmer: one-day break, the break in early May or mid-May.
* Shavuot: three-day break, the break in late May or early June.

The school year in Israel is divided into two semesters:
* Semester 1: From 1 September to late January or early February.
* Semester 2: From late January or early February to late June.

Until 2011, the summer break ended on August 31, but in 2011 Israeli ministry of education decided to shorten the summer break by one week and the break now ends on August 26 . In 2014, the old schedule was reinstated so that the summer break is back to August 31. The period between Yom Kippur and Sukkot was added as holiday to compensate for this but , has consequently been removed.

==== Yeshivas ====
In most Yeshivas, the year is divided into three periods (terms) called &quot;zmanim&quot;. Elul zman starts from the first day of the Hebrew month of Elul and extends until the end of Yom Kippur. This is the shortest (approx. six weeks), but most intense semester as it comes before the High Holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Winter zman starts nine days after Sukkot and lasts until 15 days before Passover, a duration of five months (six in a Jewish leap year). Summer semester starts after Passover and lasts until Tisha B&#x27;Av, a duration of about three months. During the interim periods, which are called &quot;bein hazmanim&quot; (between the terms), students are on vacation.

=== Italy ===

In Italy, all schools start in the first half of September, even though the exact beginning date changes every year. For schools from primary schools to high schools, the academic year is split into two semesters:
* First semester: from September to January;
* Second semester: from February to the beginning of June.

Kindergartens usually follow a similar schedule.

A university academic year is slightly different because of exams. University academic year divides into:
* First semester: from the beginning of October to the end of February. Some courses begin as early as September. Throughout January and February, there are usually no lessons, only exams.
* Second semester: from the beginning of March to the end of July. Throughout the second half of May and the months of June and July, there are also no lessons in most universities, only exams.

Even though September is a free month, it is officially an exam month in all Italian universities. It means that it is possible to take exams.
During every exam session (January–February, May–June–July or September), students are usually allowed to take any exam of their previous carrier that they couldn&#x27;t pass and even a certain number of exams of the new academic year (credit limit for this last option).

==== Public holidays in Italy ====
On the following holidays, no lessons take place:
* Carnival (particularly Mardi Gras) — usually on February;
* Easter - date changing every year, usually in March or April and lasting 5–7 days;
* Liberation Anniversary — on the 25th April;
* Labour Day — on the 1st May;
* &quot;Anniversario della Repubblica&quot; (Anniversary of the Republic) — on the 2nd June;
* &quot;Tutti i Santi&quot; (All Saints) — on the 1st November;
* &quot;Immacolata concezione&quot; (Immaculate Conception) — on the 8th December;
* Christmas, New Year&#x27;s Eve and Epiphany — from 23 December to 6 January (included)

=== Japan ===

In Japan, (trimester system). The exact date of the beginning of the summer break and its duration vary across regions, but commonly the break lasts for about five weeks. The break originated to avoid the heat in summer, so elementary, middle, and high schools in Hokkaidō and Nagano Prefecture tend to have a (slightly) shorter summer break than the rest of schools in Japan.

The graduation ceremony occurs in March, and the enrollment ceremony in early April. The Japanese public school year consists of approximately 200 days.

In recent years a few elementary, middle, and high schools have begun experimenting with having two semesters instead of the traditional three, extending the fall break to a week.

Colleges/universities run a two-semester/four-quarter system:

=== Kenya ===
In Kenya, for K-12 education, the calendar year starts in January and ends in November. The academic year is divided into 3 terms as follows:
* Term 1: Early January – Late March
* Term 2: Early May – Late July
* Term 3: Early September – Early/Mid November
April, August and December are usually school holidays.

There is no standard academic calendar for universities as each university is free to set its own calendar.

International schools tend to follow the Northern Hemisphere academic calendar.

=== Lithuania ===

In Lithuania, elementary and high schools begin on September 1 and end in mid June.

Schools also take breaks/holidays:
* Autumn break: One week at the start of November
* Christmas break: Two weeks around Christmas and New Year
* Mid-term break: One week at the end of February. (Only in primary school and primary classes in schools for older pupils.)
* Easter break: One week around Easter.
* Summer break: From mid June to August 31

=== Malaysia ===
In Malaysian primary and secondary schools, the school year is divided into two semesters. The first semester begins in early January and ends in late May, with a one-week mid-term break in March. After the mid-year holidays, which lasts for two weeks, the second semester begins in mid-June and ends in mid-November, with a one-week mid-term break in September. The school year ends with a six-week year-end holidays from mid-November to early January.

The school week varies by state, depending on the weekend of the state. For states with a Saturday-Sunday weekend, the school week is Monday to Friday. For states with a Friday-Saturday weekend (Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, and Terengganu), the school week is Sunday to Thursday; as a result, school terms begin and end a day earlier in these four states than in the rest of the country. Some schools have co-curricular activities on Saturdays.

Schools are closed on national and state public holidays. Schools are allowed to have a few special holidays without replacement for events such as school anniversary and sports day. For festivities such as Hari Raya Aidilfitri/Hari Raya Puasa, Hari Gawai, Chinese New Year and Deepavali, schools usually apply for additional holidays to allow longer breaks for students to visit relatives in their hometowns. However, every day missed exceeding the special holiday allowance would be replaced by having classes on weekends.

=== Maldives ===
In Maldivians primary and secondary schools, the school year is divided into two semesters. The first semester begins in early January and ends in early June, with a one-week mid-term break. After the mid-year holidays, which lasts for two weeks, the second semester begins in mid-June and ends in mid-November, with a one-week mid-term break.

Specifically:

The school week is Sunday to Thursday, as a result, all schools terms begin and end same day all over the country.

=== Malta ===

The school year is split into three terms. It starts at the end of September and ends at the end of June the following year.

=== Mexico ===

The school year in Mexico starts in mid/late August and ends in mid-July, by law covering 200 days, usually divided into 5 terms:

There is no fall break; however, students get to have a day off on November 20 (Revolution Day).

The calendar is designed by the Secretary of Public Education (, SEP), the government department overseeing public education aln in Mexico with arrangements of the leaders of the National Educational Workers Union (Spanish: &quot;Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación&quot;, SNTE). All public and private elementary schools under the guidance of the dependence observe this year.

In the case of universities, normally the school year starts in the last week of July and is divided in trimesters or semesters. Christmas Break is usually 3 weeks.

=== Nepal ===

Education in Nepal is structured as school education and higher education. School education includes primary level of grades 1–5, lower secondary and secondary levels of grades 6–8 and 9–10 respectively. Pre-primary level of education is available in some areas. Six years old is the prescribed age for admission into grade one. A national level examination is conducted at the end of grade 10, called Secondary Education Examination. Schools use the Bikram Sambat calendar for academic purposes, i.e. one BS year equals one academic term. The classes start in mid April and finishes late March. Summer and winter breaks are usually of one week to two weeks. A one-month festival vacation is provided during Dashain and Tihar, which usually fall on October and/or November every year.

Grades 11 and 12 are considered as higher secondary level. Higher Secondary Education Board (HSEB) supervises higher secondary schools which are mostly under private management. Previously these
grades were under the university system and were run as proficiency certificate level. Although some universities still offer these programs, the policy now is to integrate these grades into the school system. These classes start from late July and ends in April.

Higher education consists of bachelor, masters, and PhD levels. Depending upon the stream and subject, bachelors level may be of three to five years&#x27; duration. The duration of masters level is generally two years. Some universities offer programs like M Phil and post-graduate diplomas.

Vocational education in Nepal starts after lower secondary education. Students can choose to follow a two-year curriculum leading to the &quot;Technical School leaving Certificate&quot;. Universities also offers professional and technical degrees. Out of the formal track, short-term programs(1 year) focusing on skills development are also available.

=== New Zealand ===

The New Zealand school year runs from the beginning of February to mid-December, and since 1996, has been divided into four terms. By law, all state and state-integrated schools are required to be open for instruction for 380 half-days in a year (390 half-days for schools with only Year 8 students or below), meaning that the start and end of the school year is not nationally fixed to a particular date, as schools take different teacher-only days and provincial anniversary days off during the year. Schools can be exempted from opening the required number of half-days in some cases, such as in Christchurch in 2011 when many schools closed for up to a month after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The breaks between terms have fixed start and end dates, and the break length is fixed at two weeks.

In general, terms run as follows if Easter falls in early-to-mid-April:
* Term 1: Begins no earlier than Auckland Anniversary Day (Monday closest to 29 January) and no later than 7 February; ends Maundy Thursday (day before Good Friday)
* Term 2: Begins second Monday following Easter Monday; ends beginning of July
* Term 3: Begins mid-July; ends mid-to-late September
* Term 4: Begins early-to-mid October; ends no later than 20 December

If Easter falls in March or late in April, Term 1 usually ends in mid-April and Term 2 begins at the beginning of May. If Easter is in March, a 5-day half-term break then exists, with school ending on Maundy Thursday and resuming on the Wednesday. The start of term two may be delayed if Anzac Day (25 April) falls on the Monday or Tuesday directly following the Easter break.

Private schools are not required to adhere to the Ministry&#x27;s term structure, but by law they may not be open for instruction on Saturday or Sunday, the ten national public holidays, the school location&#x27;s relevant anniversary day, and the Tuesday immediately following Easter Monday.

Senior secondary students (Years 11, 12, and 13) in many state schools have examination leave from mid-November, on the Thursday or Friday before the first NCEA external examinations begin. Officially, however, the term still does not end until mid-December.

=== Oman ===

The school year in Oman is divided into two semesters:
* First semester starts in early September and runs to mid-January depending on the level.
* Second semester runs from early February to late May.
Usually there are exams at the end of each semester. Students get a number of breaks throughout the year: National Day on 18 November, New Higri year break, Prophet Mohammed birthday break, Eid Al-Fitr break and Eid Al-Adha break. As most of these breaks depend on the Higri year which is 10 days shorter than the Solar year, there is a gradual change on the date of these events in relation to the school year.

=== Pakistan ===

In Pakistan, the school year runs from April to March. Students have a two-month summer vacation and a two-week winter vacation. In Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir and some areas of Balochistan, where heavy snow paralyzes life in the winter, the schools close for two months and there are two weeks of summer vacation. There is also a brief spring break at the end of the school year as well as an optional 1-day Diwali break in the fall.

Schools and universities are off on national holidays: Pakistan Day (March 23), Independence Day (August 14), Defence of Pakistan Day (September 6), the anniversaries of the birth (December 25) and death (September 11) of Quaid-e-Azam, Allama Iqbal (November 9) and the birth (July 30) and death (July 8) of Madar-e-Millat.

Labour Day (also known as May Day) is also observed in Pakistan on May 1. Both Eid festivals are also public holidays.

In the University of Engineering and Technology Lahore, the holidays are for two and half months during summer.

For the government universities, the students of bachelors are given 1–1.5 month of summer vacation and 1–1.5 weeks of winter vacations.

=== Palestine ===
=== Philippines ===
==== Basic education ====
The Philippine school year lasts usually between nine and ten months long, and a school year must be at least 200 days as prescribed by law, including examination periods.

In most primary and secondary (Junior High) schools, an academic year is usually divided into quarters for purposes of examination and reporting of marks though a few private schools adopt a trimestral system. Each quarter normally lasts for approximately seven (usually the 3rd quarter) to ten weeks (usually the 1st, 2nd and 4th quarters) but the actual length of each quarter and the months they cover varies among private schools. The fourth quarter for pupils in Grade 6 and students in Grade 10 is usually two to three weeks shorter than undergraduates to allow for preparation of final grades to determine who are eligible for graduation as well as to prepare for the graduation (or some schools would call as &quot;completion&quot;) ceremonies themselves. Each quarter culminates in most schools with a quarterly examination period of three to five days.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the school year began in public schools in the first week of June and ended between the third week of March and the first week of April. However, private schools had a slightly shorter academic calendar either starting in the second (or third week) of June or ending earlier in March. Until that year the usual national school year was as follows:

For SY 2020-2021 up to SY 2022-2024, given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the calendar in basic education schools shifted to a more Western styled calendar to match that of most colleges and universities thus the school year in these schools is organized as follows:

When using the 2021 calendar system, the private schools&#x27; year begins in the second or third week of September and ends in late May or first/second week of June before June 12, Independence Day.

The academic term for senior high school students (Grades 11 and 12) operates on a semestral basis. Semestral, Christmas, and summer breaks are scheduled at about the same time as primary and junior high school. Grade 12 pupils have a shorter second semester than grade 11 in order for the school to prepare for graduation.

Until SY 2019–2020, summer break usually lasted for two months, starting from the first or second week of April up to early June. Most schools tended to end the school year before Holy Week. Semestral break is normally set to coincide with All Saints&#x27; and All Souls&#x27; Day. The Christmas Break usually begins in the third week of December, and classes resume the Monday or week after New Year&#x27;s Day (unless that Monday is January 2). Commencement ceremonies were often held in late March or early April. Beginning from SY 2020–2021, the summer break now falls after early to mid-June, ending in late August, which the Holy Week or Easter break replacing the former summer vacation with the switch of the calendar. The other vacation breaks remain as is.

Until 2020, the exceptions to this general schedule are international schools operating in the country, which normally follow their home country&#x27;s respective school system, since then the calendar used by these schools now closely match 2021-22 general national calendar. 

A period of transition for the public primary and secondary schools back to the old calendar system began in 2024, with private institutions either following the transition period of the former or maintaning the Western calendar.

==== Higher education ====
For most universities and colleges, an academic year is divided into two semesters, each up to 18 weeks long except for senior students in their final semester where they end the semester two weeks earlier. Enrollment/registration in an institution is usually good for only one semester, i.e. a student who successfully registers for the first semester is not automatically enrolled to study in the second semester. The student will need to successfully complete clearance requirements and in a few cases, maintain a certain overall mark in order to progress with her university studies in the next semester. The first semester is followed by a break consisting of two to four weeks before the second semester.

This break usually coincides with the Christmas holidays for institutions that transitioned to an August-to-May academic calendar. Otherwise, the break usually occurs from the second or third week of October to the second week of November for institutions operating under the old June-to-March academic calendar. The Semestral Break can be two to three weeks long, and normally includes the All Saints&#x27; and All Souls&#x27; holidays.

Other schools such as Technological University of the Philippines in Taguig, De La Salle University, the MBA program of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, University of the Philippines Diliman, Far Eastern University – East Asia College, and AMA Computer University operate under a trimestral system. For a declining number of these schools the collegiate year starts in the fourth week of May and ends in the third week of April, while most schools use a modified form of the Western system of the major universities to suit trimestral studies. Under this system, students are typically able to finish their academic studies a year earlier than those from other universities with a semestral programme. Mapúa University began using the quarterly system with eleven weeks to a term after its acquisition by the Yuchengco Group. This allows their engineering programmes to be completed a year ahead of schools running on a semestral schedule.

Moreover, starting academic year 2014–2015, constituent campuses in the University of the Philippines System started their school year in August to end in May and the University of Santo Tomas started the Academic Year in August and it will end in May 2015. In AY 2015–2016, several Philippine colleges and universities followed the lead of the two universities.

In AY 2015–2016, San Beda University and St. Scholastica&#x27;s College Manila started their calendar in early July 2015 and ended in mid- to late April 2016. The institution hoped that this move would transition it to a full August-to-May Calendar in the succeeding academic years.

Also in AY 2015–2016, the University of Santo Tomas, completed its shift to an August-to-May calendar. Ateneo de Manila University also shifted to an August-to-May Calendar this AY 2015–2016 with having a summer term in June to July before AY 2015-2016 starts. De La Salle University and De La Salle – College of St. Benilde started having an August-to-August calendar for the AY 2015–2016.

=== Poland ===

In Poland, the school year begins on September 1 and ends on the first Friday after June 18. There is a Christmas break in December which lasts until after New Year&#x27;s Day. There is also a 2nd winter holiday break lasting two weeks in January or February but the exact date is different for each voivodeship and the dates usually change each year. The 2nd winter break is also the dividing line between the two semesters of the school year.

Most universities start their courses on October 1 (at some institutions late September), and the first semester (commonly referred to as the &quot;&quot;winter term&quot;) ends in January. The second term starts in February or March, (the &quot;summer term&quot;) and ends in June. Each semester is usually 15 or 16 weeks long. After each of them there is an &quot;examination session&quot;&quot;, when no courses are taught, which lasts up to one month. The summer break starts after the exams and lasts until the start of the next academic year. In September there is an extra examination session during which students can retake failed exams.

=== South Korea ===
==== Basic Education in South Korea ====
In Korea, the school year starts at the beginning of March. Until 2015, schools followed a three-term system with a break at the end of each term plus a brief fall break interrupting the 2nd, similar to Japan:

From 2015 onwards, the calendar was changed to a more quasi-Western styled one with two semesters (although some schools retain the trimester model), having the year to end in early January rather than in February. The 1st and 2nd quarters become the 1st semester, while the 3rd and 4th become the 2nd.

School hours are approximately from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm for high school, each class lasting 50 minutes. For middle (junior high) school, the school day is from about 8:00 am–3:30 pm, each class lasting 45 minutes. In primary (elementary) school, the lower grades (grades 1–3) have classes around 8:30 to 2:00 and the upper grades (grades 4–6) have classes from about 9:00 to 3:00. Each class lasts about 40 minutes. In high school, the older students are sometimes required to stay until 9:00 pm or later studying on their own. For the most part, teachers rotate and the students stay in their classroom except for certain classes such as Physical Education, Music and Science labs.

There is a popular saying in Korean, 노는 토요일 (no-neun to-yo-il), meaning &quot;resting on Saturdays&quot;. From 2006 to 2011, Korean students (from elementary to secondary schools) were required to go to school on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Saturdays of each month. Prior to 2006, students had to go to school six days a week, except for 2005, when students had one Saturday off every month. The schools normally ended at noon on Saturday, and the curriculum was mostly focused on extracurricular activities. However, the Korean Ministry of Education abolished school days on Saturdays in 2012.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the school year was delayed to April, causing a change in the calendar:

However, the calendar was shifted back to the March–January model in 2021.

The international schools in South Korea usually start the school year in early/mid-August and end in early June.

==== Higher education in South Korea ====
South Korean universities and post-secondary institutions similarly have a two-semester/four-quarter system, with the first semester beginning about March 2 and ending in mid-late June, and the second beginning at the start of September and ending in mid-late December.

Many universities offer optional short-term &quot;camp&quot; non-credit courses during semester (summer/winter) breaks, but credit courses are not common during summers and winters.

Academic terms may vary among privatized institutions in Taiwan.

==== Higher Education ====
Semester periods in higher education are similar to those in basic education, with reduced weeks often scheduled towards the end.

There are two semesters in the Thai academic year with an optional summer semester. From kindergarten to high school, the first semester opens in mid May and continues until the end of September. The second semester lasts from November until the end of February (or early March). The university academic year is slightly different, lasting from mid August to late December and early January to mid May.

=== Turkey ===
The Turkish academic year begins in September and continues through to the following June. In most public educational institutions from primary to tertiary, the first semester begins in September and continues until January, and the second semester begins February and continues until June. The academic calendar and dates of mid-semester breaks may vary across private institutions.

=== Ukraine ===
The academic year at universities starts on September the 1st and usually consists of two semesters. The first semester runs from September the 1st to January the 24/25th followed by a two-week holiday. The second semester runs from February the 9th to June the 30th or July the 4/5th.

=== United Kingdom ===
==== Historical context of terms in the UK ====
The English law courts terms and legal training pupillage divided the year into four terms, partly to create a predictable work schedule, but also to make allowances for harsh travel conditions and delays caused by adverse weather at a time when all English law students and many litigants had to travel to London for training or legal advice at one of the Inns of Court. The English legal year still runs to this calendar:

In Scotland, academic and judicial institutions traditionally organised their year around the Scottish term days, the traditional divisions of the Scottish legal year:
* Candlemas: 2 February, Candlemas, which fell forty days after Christmas, marked the presentation of the infant Jesus in the temple and the purification of the Virgin Mary.
* Whitsunday: originally a moveable term day, coming the seventh Sunday after Easter, was fixed in Scotland at 15 May in 1693. Whitsunday was originally the feast of Pentecost, around which a great many christenings would occur, so it became associated with the color white.
* Lammas Day: 1 August, feast of St. Peter ad Vincula was a corruption of loaf-mass, the Sunday on which the first fruits of harvest were offered, first corn ground, and first loaf made. In Scotland it was associated with hand-fasting and some fairs on this day were called handfasting fairs. (Originally synonymous with betrothal, handfasting became a contract binding a man and woman to live together for a year and a day before they decided on permanent marriage).
* Martinmas: 11 November, was known as St. Martin in Winter or St. Martin of Tours to distinguish this from another feast of St. Martin in July.

==== Primary/Secondary education in the UK ====
The school year in the United Kingdom is generally divided into three terms running from autumn to summer. For state schools, the school year consists of 195 days of which there are 190 teaching days and five INSET teacher training days. For independent schools, the school year can be as short as 175 days. The structure of the school year varies between the constituent countries of the United Kingdom with school holiday dates varying between local education authorities.

Before the mechanisation of agriculture and when more of the population lived in the rural countryside, the long summer school holiday in Britain arose in the 19th century as a result of the education authorities abandoning the battle to keep children at school through haymaking (around the start of August) and wheat harvest (around the end of August), when every available pair of hands was needed on the land.

==== England and Wales ====
In England and Wales, the school year generally runs from early September until late July of the following year. Most schools operate a three-term school year, each term divided in half by a week-long break known as &quot;half term&quot; (although some counties, like Oxfordshire, consider these to be six separate terms instead), and are structured as follows:
There is no winter term.

The terms are separated by two holidays, each of approximately two weeks&#x27; duration: the Christmas holidays separating the autumn term and spring term, and the Easter holidays separating the spring term and the summer term. The period between the end of one school year and the start of the next is the summer holidays, which are six to eight weeks long.

===== Alternative arrangements for English and Welsh schools =====
The academic year originated in the pre-industrial era when all non-disabled young people were expected to work through the period of July and August. For the purposes of education, the remainder of the year was arranged into three terms accommodating the Christian holidays of Christmas and Easter. Half-term breaks divide the 16- to 17-week terms.

However the long summer break has been criticised by educationalists in the post-industrialist age because it creates a break in the academic progress. Even a House of Commons Education Select Committee recommended in 1999 that schools switch to a five-term academic year, abolishing the long summer holidays. Each term would be eight weeks long with a two-week break in between terms, and a minimum four-week summer holiday, with no half terms—the idea being that children can keep up momentum for eight weeks without a break. The proposals were introduced at a small number of schools nationally.

In 1999, the Local Government Association set up a commission to look at alternative proposals for a more balanced school year. In partnership with Local Authorities and teachers unions, they were unable to agree to a suitable alternative arrangement for terms, but by 2004 came to an agreement with the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers for a standardised arrangement of school terms. Since 2004, around one third of English local authorities have signed up to the proposals which see a standard academic year agreed between the authorities, including slight variations on the traditional schemes, based on the following principles:
* start the school year on a September date as near as possible to 1 September;
* equalise teaching and learning blocks (roughly 2×7 and 4×6 weeks);
* establish a two-week spring break in early April irrespective of the incidence of the Easter bank holiday. (Where the break does not coincide with the bank holiday the date should be, as far as practicable, nationally agreed and as consistent as possible across all local authorities);
* allow for the possibility of a summer holiday of at least six weeks for those schools which want this length of break.
* identify and agree annually designated periods of holiday, including the summer holiday, where head teachers are recommended not to arrange teacher days.

In addition the independent schools have set their own term dates with varying degrees of local and national co-ordination.

==== Northern Ireland ====
The school year in Northern Ireland generally runs from early September to late June or early July of the following year. Most schools operate a three-term school year similar to England and Wales; however, there is no half term during summer term due to the province&#x27;s longer summer holidays. The terms are structured as follows:
* Autumn Term: September to December (half term: late October)
* Spring Term: January to the Friday before Lazarus Saturday (half term: mid-February)
* Summer Term: Second Monday after Easter to June or early July

The terms are separated by two holidays each consisting of approximately two weeks: the Christmas holidays separating the autumn and spring terms, and the Easter holidays separating the spring and summer terms. The summer holidays in Northern Ireland last nine weeks, from the start of July until the end of August, due to the Twelfth of July bank holiday.

==== Scotland ====
The school year in Scotland generally runs from middle or late August to late June or early July of the following year (usually in eastern council areas from the third Monday in August to the first Friday in July and in western council areas from the second Monday in August to the last Friday in June). Most schools operate a three-term school year, each term divided in half by a break known as &#x27;mid-term&#x27;, lasting a week or two in October, a few days to a week in February, and a few days in May. The terms are structured as follows:
* Autumn Term: August to December (mid-term: middle to late October)
* Spring Term: January to the Friday before Lazarus Saturday (mid-term: mid-February)
* Summer Term: Second Monday after Easter to June (mid-term: late May)

The terms are separated by two holidays each consisting of approximately two weeks: the Christmas Holidays separating the autumn and spring terms, and the Easter holidays separating the spring and summer terms. The period between the end of one school year and the start of the next is known as the summer holidays and consists of six or seven weeks.

==== Universities in the UK ====
Although the specific timetables and activities (e.g. teaching, revision periods, exams) contained therein vary per institution, the academic year at most UK universities runs from late-September or early-October to June or July with three or four week breaks around Christmas and Easter that divide the year into three terms. Most universities overlay a semester structure for academic courses on top of this. Many universities, particularly older ones, use terms, often with the last term given over to exams. Some older universities have special names for the three terms, e.g. Michaelmas, Hilary, Trinity (Oxford) or Michaelmas, Epiphany, Easter (Durham).

Special term names (i.e. not first, second, third; autumn, spring, summer; or other obvious names) in use include:

Exceptions to the ordinary structure of the academic year include the University of Buckingham, where undergraduate courses do not coincide with the academic year used by universities in Britain and elsewhere. Instead, they largely coincide with the calendar year—they typically start in January or February, with examinations in autumn.

=== United States ===

There are two different systems (with three different names) used in the US:
* A quarter system divides the calendar year into four terms, usually named after the seasons in which they begin or conclude. The instruction period (covering classes and examinations) in each quarter is between nine and 13 weeks. Three consecutive academic quarters counts as one academic year, as long as these comprise a minimum of 30 weeks of instruction. Academic credit earned in a quarter system is measured in quarter credit hours, with full time (for federal student aid purposes) being a minimum of 12 credit hours.
* A semester (from &#x27;six months&#x27;) or trimester (from &#x27;three months&#x27;) system divides the year into three periods, typically fall, spring and summer, of between 14 and 21 weeks of instruction time (although the summer period may be less than 14 weeks). Two of these periods count as one academic year, as long as these comprise a minimum of 30 weeks of instruction. Full time (for federal student aid purposes) is a minimum of 12 semester or trimester credit hours.

The above reflects federal government definitions. However, other sources define a semester as only containing two periods (fall and spring) of 15 weeks each and a trimester as containing three periods (fall, spring, summer) of 12 to 14 weeks each, and quarters of 10 weeks, or semesters as being 15 to 17 weeks, trimesters 10 to 12 weeks, and quarters 10 weeks each.

As an academic year comprises three quarters or two semesters, two semester credit hours = three quarter credit hours. Thus, a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree typically requires a minimum of 180 quarter hours (12 quarters) or 120 semester hours (eight semesters), requiring an average of 15 credit hours per quarter or semester to complete in four years.

==== Primary and secondary school calendars in the US ====
In the United States, the K–12 school calendar is determined by the individual states, and in some cases by the local school district, so there is considerable variation. The academic year typically consists of two 18-week semesters, each divided into two nine-week marking periods (or quarters) or three six-week marking periods, and constituting 170 to 186 instructional days (with an average of 180). An instructional week is five instructional days, measured Monday–Friday at most public and private schools although there are variations. Grades are usually reported per marking period, but major examinations are given per semester or per year.

The traditional start date for the school year has been the Tuesday after Labor Day. Although some schools still keep this tradition, many schools now start in late August or sometimes as early as late July while some other schools (especially private ones) may start as late as the mid to late September or the first week in October. The school year usually ends around late-May or as late as mid or late June).

School holidays in the United States vary by jurisdiction. They include federal, state, and local holidays, all or only some of which may be observed by an individual school district. In addition to these legal holidays, there are vacation periods of varying length, a recess of two weeks during the winter holiday period at Christmas and New Year and a one-week spring break in March or April being typical.

Sprinkled throughout the year, many schools have &quot;in-service&quot; days which are days off for the students and where faculty and staff receive staff development or training. Additionally, there may be days set aside for parent–teacher conferences on student progress, especially in primary school. Sometimes schools do half-day in-service days in which students are dismissed early, rather than full-day holidays.

Unplanned interruptions in schooling (such as weather events like heavy snow) can extend the school year on occasion. Such calendar extensions, as well as the initial cancellations, are decided by each local administration and announced to the parents in as timely manner as possible.

==== Community colleges in the US ====
Many, but not all, community colleges originated as extensions of the primary and secondary school system.

Some of these colleges often continue to follow the K-12 schedule. However, most operate under a semester based schedule. Washington state schools are standardized by the State Board of Community and Technical colleges and follow a quarter system.

==== Collegiate calendars in the US ====
Most American colleges and universities refer to their calendars as following either the quarter system, semester system or trimester system. The terminology used may not follow that used by the federal government; in particular &#x27;trimesters&#x27; may be used to refer to the division of the academic year into three blocks of 13 weeks or less, equivalent to the federal definition of &#x27;quarters&#x27; (e.g. Carleton College or Union College, which both have three 10-week &#x27;trimesters&#x27; in an academic year.) Some schools, particularly some business schools and community colleges, use the or mini-semester system.

The &quot;quarter system&quot; divides the calendar year into four quarters, three of which constitute a complete academic year. Quarters are typically 10–12 weeks long so that three quarters amount to 30–36 weeks of instruction. Approximately 20 percent of universities are on the quarter system. Most colleges that use the quarter system have a fall quarter from late September to mid-December, a winter quarter from early January to mid-March, a spring quarter from late March or early April to mid-June, and an optional summer session. Notable users of the quarter system include the University of California system (excluding Berkeley, Merced, the UCLA medical school, and all of the system&#x27;s law schools), Stanford, the University of Chicago, Dartmouth College, Northwestern University, University of Washington, the University of Oregon, and DePaul University. Union College uses a modified quarter system: fall, winter, and spring terms are each eleven weeks long; there are some summer classes, but there is no official summer quarter. Because Union&#x27;s calendar makes use of just three of four quarters, the three academic terms are generally (and somewhat misleadingly to outsiders) dubbed &quot;trimesters&quot;, which they literally are since they each span three months, December, July and August being off. Another notable and somewhat unique user of the quarter system is Baylor Law School: it operates on the quarter system while the remaining colleges of Baylor University operate on the semester system.

The &quot;semester system&quot; divides the calendar year into two semesters of 16 to 18 weeks each, plus summer sessions of varying lengths. The two semesters together constitute 32 to 36 weeks of instruction, so that three academic quarters equal two academic semesters. Thus, academic credit earned in quarter hours converts to semester hours at of its value, while credit earned in semester hours converts to quarter hours at 3/2 of its value. Put another way, 3 quarter hours is 2 semester hours. Most universities on the semester system have a fall semester from the day after Labor Day in September to mid-December, a spring/winter semester from late January to early May, and an optional summer session.

In practice, the average quarter-long course is four or five units and the average semester course is three units, so a full-time student graduating in four years would take five courses per semester and three or four courses per quarter.

Some colleges and universities have a &quot;4-1-4 system&quot;, which divides the year into two four-month terms (September to December and February to May) as well as a single one-month term in January in which students can do independent study, study abroad, internships, activities, or focus on one or two classes. The one-month term is sometimes called a &quot;&quot;, &quot;winter session&quot;, &quot;inter-term/interim/intersession&quot; or &quot;J-term&quot;. Examples of schools using this system include:
Austin College, University of Rhode Island, Whittier College, Williams College, Bethany College in West Virginia, Berea College, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, New College of Florida, Calvin University, Elmhurst University, Gustavus Adolphus College, Linfield College, Luther College, Oberlin College, Middlebury College, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Eckerd College, Wofford College, Saint Olaf College, Samford University, Miami University, Hofstra University, University of Delaware, Saint Mary&#x27;s College of California, Colby College, Chapman University, McDaniel College, Elon University, Pacific University, and Pacific Lutheran University.

Some schools have a similar format but ordered as &quot;4–4–1&quot;, with the short term in May after the conclusion of the spring semester. Examples of schools using this system include Wartburg College, Bates College, Chatham University, Clemson University, The College of New Jersey, Elmira College, Ohio State University, Purdue University, Transylvania University, the University of Redlands, Emory University and Washington and Lee University&#x27;s 12-12-4 undergraduate calendar.

The &quot;trimester system&quot; evolved out of the semester system. It divides the academic year into three equal portions of 10 weeks each. Institutions that use the trimester system include Carleton College, Knox College (Illinois), Lawrence University, Union College, Kalamazoo College, Dartmouth College, and the United States Merchant Marine Academy. Course loads are typically 3 classes per trimester. While students take fewer classes, most classes meet for more hours per week than typical in a semester-based system, such that the total material covered in a 10-week trimester is meant to be comparable to the amount of material learned in a 15-week semester. Thus, in trimester-based colleges, one completes 9 courses in the academic year (3 courses x 3 trimesters) relative to the 8 courses typical in a semester-based system (4 courses x 2 semesters).

Some schools that operate summer session are sometimes referred to as having &quot;trimesters&quot;, with the summer session being the third annual session. For instance, the University of Michigan and Brigham Young University, have Fall semester that operates from September through December and a Winter trimester that runs from January through April. However, they have a spring-summer session that operates from May through August, as two half-terms. Most spring-summer classes either meet double-time for 7–8 weeks in May and June or double-time/double-plus-time for 6–8 weeks in July and August (with summer half-term classes sometimes starting in the last week of June).

The academic calendar at Park University operates with five terms per year, each lasting eight weeks (January–March, March–May, June–July, August–October, and October–December).

A number of colleges have adopted the &quot;one course at a time&quot; or &quot;block schedule&quot; calendar. Academic years consist of a number of terms lasting roughly four weeks each, during which a full semester&#x27;s amount of work is completed in one and only one class. Colorado College first began their &quot;Block Plan&quot; in 1970, followed by Maharishi International University in 1971, and Cornell College in 1978. Tusculum University in Tusculum, Tennessee, and The University of Montana - Western are the only other colleges operating under this academic calendar.

<text>Mundus or Mundo (, ; died 536) was a Barbarian commander of Gepid, Hun, and/or Gothic origins. He appears to have been the son of the Gepid king Giesmus. In the early 500s he commanded a group of bandits in Pannonia, eventually allying himself to the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. After Theodoric&#x27;s death in 526, Mundus entered Byzantine service under emperor Justinian I, fighting in the Balkans, defending Justinian during the Nika riots, and fighting in the first stage of the Gothic War, during which he died in 536.

==Etymology==
Mundus&#x27;s name is attested as in Jordanes and Marcellinus Comes and as (Mundus) in Greek sources. The differences between the Greek and Latin names are unusual and Gerhard Doerfer suspects that the Greek name has been partially Hellenized.

Omeljan Pritsak argues that Mundus&#x27;s name had the same Turkic etymology as proposed by Gyula Németh and László Rásonyi for Attila&#x27;s father Mundzuk, from Turkic &quot;*munʒu&quot; (jewel, pearl; flag). Pritsak also argues that Mundus&#x27;s father, Giesmus, had a name derived ultimately from the Turkic–Mongolian root &quot;kes/käs&quot; (protector, bestower of favor, blessing, good-fortune).

Otto Maenchen-Helfen, however, takes &quot;Giesmus&quot; for a Germanic name and in this connection notes Moritz Schönfeld&#x27;s Germanic etymology of &quot;Mundus&quot;, comparing it to the Germanic names &quot;Mundila&quot; and &quot;Munderic&quot;, both derived from PGmc *&quot;munda&quot; (&quot;protection). Stefan Krautschik likewise argues that the Germanic name of Mundus&#x27;s grandson Theudimund speaks for a Germanic etymology. Gottfried Schramm rejects a Germanic origin, arguing that an original East Germanic name would have appeared as &quot;*Munda&quot; in Jordanes. However, Gudmund Schütte notes other East Germanic names recorded as ending in -o rather than -a, such as &quot;Veduco&quot; and &quot;Tremo&quot;, and proposed interference in the Latin transcription from another Germanic dialect.

==Ethnic identity==
Different ancient authors give different indications of Mundus&#x27;s ethnic identity. Jordanes identifies Mundus as &quot;formerly of the Attilani,&quot; that is, the Huns (Jord. Get. 301), whereas John Malalas (chap. 450) and Theophanes the Confessor (A.M. 6032) identify Mundus as the son of a king of the Gepids. Marcellinus Comes refers to Mundus as a , which he also uses to mean Ostrogoth, while Procopius merely says he was a barbarian.

The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire has argued that because Mundo (Jordanes) has Hunnic origins and Mundus has Gepid origins, they cannot be the same person, an argument rejected by Patrick Amory and Stefan Krautschik. Brian Croke argued that Jordanes&#x27;s statement could also mean that Mundus originated in the confederacy of the Huns rather than that he was a Hun himself. Stefan Krautschik instead argues that the Gepid royal family and the Attilid dynasty were likely connected by marriage. According to Amory, Mundus could have had ancestors who thought of themselves as Goths, Gepids, or Huns, from among which he and others could have chosen as needed.

== Biography ==
According to Theophanes, Mundus was the son of Giesmus, a ruler of the East Germanic tribe Gepids with his capital in Sirmium, and nephew to another Gepid ruler, Thraustila. After his father&#x27;s death, Mundus was raised by his maternal uncle Thraustila, who likely succeeded Giesmus. Thraustila was killed in battle in 488, failing to resist the Ostrogoths and their king, Theodoric the Great. Sirmium was taken by the Ostrogoths. after Thraustila was succeeded by his son Traseric, Mundus came to lead a group of bandits in Pannonia. He declared himself a king and established himself in a tower called Herta. When the Byzantines sent an army to fight him under the general Sabinianus in 505, Theodoric sent his general Pitzias and he and Mundus joined forces and defeated Sabinianus. Although he disappears from the sources, Mundus appears to have remained Theodoric&#x27;s ally until the latter&#x27;s death in 526.

Mundus is next mentioned as a commander of the Gepids and Heruli in Pannonia in the 520s. In 529, in the context of new battles between the Gepids and Byzantines, Mundus and his son Mauricius entered Byzantine service and was made magister militum in Illyricum by the Byzantine emperor Justinian I, where he fought against the Slavs and Bulgars. In 531, he replaced Belisarius as &quot;magister militum per Orientem&quot; before re-assuming his rank of &quot;Magister militum per Illyricum&quot; again in 532. In that same year, Mundus and a troop of Heruli happened to be in Constantinople when the Nika riots broke out; he successfully suppressed the riots with Belisarius, with his troops massacring many near the hippodrome. In 535, with the outbreak of the Gothic War, Mundus was sent to Dalmatia and conquered the city of Salona (Split) from the Goths. In 536, his son Mauricius was killed during a Gothic counterattack; Mundus subsequently thoroughly defeated the Goths, but was killed while pursuing them.

<text>Experiential learning (ExL) is the process of learning through experience, and is more narrowly defined as &quot;learning through reflection on doing&quot;. Hands-on learning can be a form of experiential learning, but does not necessarily involve students reflecting on their product. Experiential learning is distinct from rote or didactic learning, in which the learner plays a comparatively passive role. It is related to, but not synonymous with, other forms of active learning such as action learning, adventure learning, free-choice learning, cooperative learning, service-learning, and situated learning.

Experiential learning is often used synonymously with the term &quot;experiential education&quot;, but while experiential education is a broader philosophy of education, experiential learning considers the individual learning process. As such, compared to experiential education, experiential learning is concerned with more concrete issues related to the learner and the learning context. Experiences &quot;stick out&quot; in the mind and assist with information retention. 

The general concept of learning through experience is ancient. Around 350 BC, Aristotle wrote in the &quot;&quot; &quot;for the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them&quot;. But as an articulated educational approach, experiential learning is of much more recent origin. Beginning in the 1970s, David A. Kolb helped develop the modern theory of experiential learning, drawing heavily on the work of John Dewey, Kurt Lewin, and Jean Piaget.

Experiential learning has significant teaching advantages. Peter Senge, author of &quot;The Fifth Discipline&quot; (1990), states that teaching is of utmost importance to motivate people. Learning only has good effects when learners have the desire to absorb the knowledge. Therefore, experiential learning requires the showing of directions for learners.

Experiential learning entails a hands-on approach to learning that moves away from just the teacher at the front of the room imparting and transferring their knowledge to students. It makes learning an experience that moves beyond the classroom and strives to bring a more involved way of learning.

==Kolb&#x27;s experiential learning model==

Experiential learning focuses on the learning process for the individual. One example of experiential learning is going to the zoo and learning through observation and interaction with the zoo environment, as opposed to reading about animals from a book. Thus, one makes discoveries and experiments with knowledge firsthand, instead of hearing or reading about others&#x27; experiences. Likewise, in business school, internship, and job-shadowing, opportunities in a student&#x27;s field of interest can provide valuable experiential learning which contributes significantly to the student&#x27;s overall understanding of the real-world environment.

A third example of experiential learning involves learning how to ride a bike, a process which can illustrate the four-step experiential learning model (ELM) as set forth by Kolb and outlined in Figure 1 below. Following this example, in the &quot;concrete experience&quot; stage, the learner physically interacts with the bike in the &quot;here and now&quot;. This experience forms &quot;the basis for observation and reflection&quot; and the learner has the opportunity to consider what is working or failing (reflective observation), formulate a generalized theory or idea about riding a bike in general (abstract conceptualization) and to think about ways to improve on the next attempt made at riding (active experimentation). Every new attempt to ride is informed by a cyclical pattern of previous experience, thought and reflection.

===Elements===

Experiential learning can occur without a teacher and relates solely to the meaning-making process of the individual&#x27;s direct experience. However, though the gaining of knowledge is an inherent process that occurs naturally, a genuine learning experience requires certain elements. According to Kolb, knowledge is continuously gained through both personal and environmental experiences. Kolb states that in order to gain genuine knowledge from an experience, the learner must have four abilities:

*The learner must be willing to be actively involved in the experience;
*The learner must be able to reflect on the experience;
*The learner must possess and use analytical skills to conceptualize the experience; and
*The learner must possess decision making and problem solving skills in order to use the new ideas gained from the experience.

==Implementation==
Experiential learning requires self-initiative, an &quot;intention to learn&quot; and an &quot;active phase of learning&quot;. Kolb&#x27;s cycle of experiential learning can be used as a framework for considering the different stages involved. Jennifer A. Moon has elaborated on this cycle to argue that experiential learning is most effective when it involves: 1) a &quot;reflective learning phase&quot; 2) a phase of learning resulting from the actions inherent to experiential learning, and 3) &quot;a further phase of learning from feedback&quot;. This process of learning can result in &quot;changes in judgment, feeling or skills&quot; for the individual and can provide direction for the &quot;making of judgments as a guide to choice and action&quot;.

Most educators understand the important role experience plays in the learning process. The role of emotion and feelings in learning from experience has been recognised as an important part of experiential learning. While those factors may improve the likelihood of experiential learning occurring, it can occur without them. Rather, what is vital in experiential learning is that the individual is encouraged to directly involve themselves in the experience, and then to reflect on their experiences using analytic skills, in order that they gain a better understanding of the new knowledge and retain the information for a longer time.

Reflection is a crucial part of the experiential learning process, and like experiential learning itself, it can be facilitated or independent. Dewey wrote that &quot;successive portions of reflective thought grow out of one another and support one another&quot;, creating a scaffold for further learning, and allowing for further experiences and reflection. This reinforces the fact that experiential learning and reflective learning are iterative processes, and the learning builds and develops with further reflection and experience. Facilitation of experiential learning and reflection is challenging, but &quot;a skilled facilitator, asking the right questions and guiding reflective conversation before, during, and after an experience, can help open a gateway to powerful new thinking and learning&quot;. Jacobson and Ruddy, building on Kolb&#x27;s four-stage Experiential Learning Model and Pfeiffer and Jones&#x27;s five stage Experiential Learning Cycle, took these theoretical frameworks and created a simple, practical questioning model for facilitators to use in promoting critical reflection in experiential learning. Their &quot;5 Questions&quot; model is as follows:
* Did you notice?
* Why did that happen?
* Does that happen in life?
* Why does that happen?
* How can you use that?

These questions are posed by the facilitator after an experience, and gradually lead the group towards a critical reflection on their experience, and an understanding of how they can apply the learning to their own life. Although the questions are simple, they allow a relatively inexperienced facilitator to apply the theories of Kolb, Pfeiffer, and Jones, and deepen the learning of the group.

While it is the learner&#x27;s experience that is most important to the learning process, it is also important not to forget the wealth of experience a good facilitator also brings to the situation. However, while a facilitator, or &quot;teacher&quot;, may improve the likelihood of experiential learning occurring, a facilitator is not essential to experiential learning. Rather, the mechanism of experiential learning is the learner&#x27;s reflection on experiences using analytic skills. This can occur without the presence of a facilitator, meaning that experiential learning is not defined by the presence of a facilitator. Yet, by considering experiential learning in developing course or program content, it provides an opportunity to develop a framework for adapting varying teaching/learning techniques into the classroom.

== In schools ==
Experiential learning is supported in different school organizational models and learning environments.

* Hyper Island is a global, constructivist school originally from Sweden, with a range of school and executive education programs grounded in experience-based learning, and with reflection taught as key skill to learn for life.
* THINK Global School is a four-year traveling high school that holds classes in a new country each term. Students engage in experiential learning through activities such as workshops, cultural exchanges, museum tours, and nature expeditions.
*In the ELENA-Project, the follow-up project of &quot;animals live&quot;, experiential learning with living animals will be developed. Together with project partners from Romania, Hungary and Georgia, the Bavarian Academy of Nature Conservation and Landscape Management in Germany brings living animals in the lessons of European schools. The aim is to brief children for the context of the biological diversity and to support them to develop ecologically oriented values.
*Loving High School in Loving, New Mexico, publishes career and technical education opportunities for students. These include internship for students who are interested in science, STEM majors, or architecture. The school is making good connections with local businesses, which helps students get used to working in such environments.
* The Work Experience Builders project connect work to learning by helping students gain real-world work experience and experiential knowledge within a mentored project-based learning environment.
*Chicago Public Schools operates eight early college STEM high schools through its Early College STEM School Initiative. The eight high schools offer four-years of computer science classes to every student. Additionally, students are able to earn college credits from local community colleges. Each school partners with a technology company which offers students internships and mentors from the company to expose students to jobs in STEM fields.
*Robert H. Smith School of Business offers select undergraduate students a year-round advanced course whereby students conduct financial analyses and security trades to manage real investment dollars in the Lemma Senbet Fund.
* Nonprofits such as Out Teach, Life Lab, Nature Explore, and the National Wildlife Federation, provide training for teachers on how to use outdoor spaces for experiential learning.
* Many European schools take part in intercultural educational programs, such as the European Youth Parliament, which uses experience-based learning to promote intercultural understanding among young students, through indoor and outdoor activities, discussions and debates.

==In business education==
As higher education continues to adapt to new expectations from students, experiential learning in business and accounting programs has become more important. For example, Clark &amp; White (2010) point out that &quot;a quality university business education program must include an experiential learning component&quot;. With reference to this study, employers note that graduating students need to build skills in &quot;professionalism&quot; – which can be taught via experiential learning. Students value this learning as much as industry. 

Learning styles also impact business education in the classroom. Kolb positions four learning styles, &quot;Diverger, Assimilator, Accommodator &quot; and &quot;Converger&quot;, atop the Experiential Learning Model, using the four experiential learning stages to carve out &quot;four quadrants&quot;, one for each learning style. An individual&#x27;s dominant learning style can be identified by taking Kolb&#x27;s Learning Style Inventory (LSI). More recent researchers have argued that learning styles are a neuromyth, and that categorising learners according to styles is unhelpful and inaccurate. 

Robert Loo (2002) undertook a meta-analysis of 8 studies which revealed that Kolb&#x27;s learning styles were not equally distributed among business majors in the sample. More specifically, results indicated that there appears to be a high proportion of assimilators and a lower proportion of accommodators than expected for business majors. Not surprisingly, within the accounting sub-sample there was a higher proportion of convergers and a lower proportion of accommodators. Similarly, in the finance sub-sample, a higher proportion of assimilators and lower proportion of divergers was apparent. Within the marketing sub-sample there was an equal distribution of styles. This would provide some evidence to suggest that while it is useful for educators to be aware of common learning styles within business and accounting programs, they should be encouraging students to use all four learning styles appropriately and students should use a wide range of learning methods.

Professional education applications, also known as management training or organizational development, apply experiential learning techniques in training employees at all levels within the business and professional environment. Interactive, role-play based customer service training is often used in large retail chains. Training board games simulating business and professional situations such as the Beer Distribution Game used to teach supply chain management, and the Friday Night at the ER game used to teach systems thinking, are used in business training efforts.

==In business==


Experiential business learning is the process of learning and developing business skills through the medium of shared experience. The main point of difference between this and academic learning is more “real-life” experience for the recipient.

This may include for example, learning gained from a network of business leaders sharing best practice, or individuals being mentored or coached by a person who has faced similar challenges and issues, or simply listening to an expert or thought leader in current business thinking.

Providers of this type of experiential business learning often include membership organisations who offer product offerings such as peer group learning, professional business networking, expert/speaker sessions, mentoring and/or coaching.

==Comparisons==
Experiential learning is most easily compared with academic learning, the process of acquiring information through the study of a subject without the necessity for direct experience. While the dimensions of experiential learning are analysis, initiative, and immersion, the dimensions of academic learning are constructive learning and reproductive learning. Though both methods aim to instill new knowledge in the learner, academic learning does so through more abstract, classroom-based techniques, whereas experiential learning actively involves the learner in a concrete experience.

==Benefits==
* Experience real world: For example, students who major in Chemistry may have chances to interact with the chemical environment. Learners who have a desire to become businesspeople will have the opportunity to experience the manager position.
* Improved on-the-job performance: For example, municipal bus drivers trained via high-fidelity simulation training (instead of just classroom training) showed significant decreases in accidents and fuel consumption.
* Opportunities for creativity: There is always more than one solution for a problem in the real world. Students will have a better chance to learn that lesson when they get to interact with real life experiences.

<text>John Babington Macaulay Baxter (February 16, 1868 – December 27, 1946) was a New Brunswick lawyer, jurist and the 19th premier of New Brunswick. 

Baxter served in the Canadian Army and was the author of &quot;Historical Records of the New Brunswick Regiment, Royal Artillery&quot;, the unit he commanded from 1907 to 1912. He also had a keen interest in genealogy and in 1943 the New Brunswick Museum published his book titled &quot;Simon Baxter - The first United Empire Loyalist to settle in New Brunswick, (Canada)&quot;.

Born in Saint John, New Brunswick, John Baxter served on the municipal council for eighteen years from 1892 to 1910. A Conservative Party member, he was elected to the 32nd New Brunswick Legislative Assembly in 1911. He was appointed Attorney-General of the province, holding that office from 1915 to 1917. He entered federal politics and served as Minister of Customs and Excise under Prime Minister Arthur Meighen in 1921 before taking over the leadership of the provincial Conservative party and leading it to victory in 1925.

Baxter was a leader of the Maritime Rights Movement which expressed the discontent felt by the maritime provinces concerning their loss of influence in the Canadian confederation dominated by the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. 

He left politics in 1931 and was appointed Chief Justice of the New Brunswick Supreme Court in 1935, which he would serve for the remainder of his life. Additionally, Baxter was a Freemason and served as the Grand Master for the Grand Lodge of New Brunswick, holding meetings at the Saint John Masonic Temple. 

His son, John B. M. Baxter, Jr., later served in the cabinet of Richard Hatfield. He is the great grandfather of Luke Macaulay Baxter, the son of Kirk Macaulay Baxter.

He died in West Saint John in 1946 at 78.

<text>Sponsoring something (or someone) is the act of supporting an event, activity, person, or organization financially or through the provision of products or services. The individual or group that provides the support, similar to a benefactor, is known as the sponsor.

==Definition==
Sponsorship is a cash and/or in-kind fee paid to a property (typically in sports, arts, entertainment or causes) in return for access to the exploitable commercial potential associated with that property.

While the sponsoree (property being sponsored) may be nonprofit, unlike philanthropy, sponsorship is done with the expectation of a commercial return.

While sponsorship can deliver increased awareness, brand building and propensity to purchase, it is different from advertising. Unlike advertising, sponsorship can not communicate specific product attributes. Nor can it stand alone, as sponsorship requires support elements.

Proponents of sponsorship would, however, point to its unique position in the marketing mix. A sponsorship program can include all other marketing elements including advertising, promotions, merchandise, hospitality, PR and social media. This allows sponsorship to be used to address a much wider range of business objectives. For example, a sponsor buying the rights to a sports team or competition could achieve increased brand awareness through high profile signage, but might also use hospitality tickets for staff motivation programs or to host key trade customers. On-pack promotions could be linked to the sports property to create a much more compelling consumer proposition and to associate the brand directly with a sports property which has much greater image attributes than the sponsoring brand.

==Theories==
Various psychological and communication theories have been employed to elucidate the mechanisms by which commercial sponsorship influences consumer audiences. Many theories posit that sponsorship creates a cognitive link between a brand (sponsor) and an event (sponsoree), leading to the formation of event-linked associations in memory. Consequently, thinking of the brand can evoke these associations, influencing consumer perceptions and behaviors. Cornwell, Weeks and Roy (2005) have published an extensive review of the theories so far used to explain commercial sponsorship effects.

One of the most pervasive findings in sponsorship is that the best effects are achieved where there is a logical match between the sponsor and sponsoree, such as a sports brand sponsoring a sports event. Work by Cornwell and colleagues however, has shown that brands that don&#x27;t have a logical match can still benefit, at least in terms of memory effects, if the sponsor articulates some rationale for the sponsorship to the audience.

==Categories==

* Series sponsor is the highest status of sponsorship. Often the name and the logo of the sponsor is incorporated into the title of the series (NASCAR Cup Series). This status also allows companies to have a decisive voice on the issue of presence among sponsors of other companies operating in the same business, the priority right to use teams, team members, players, coaches, and the sanctioning body for conducting joint promotions, right of presence at all official events dedicated to a sports event, mandatory mentioning in all activities conducted on behalf of the team, highlighting the name of title sponsor in film credits, television programs which were created with its financial support, placement of logos and banners. Often a patch or sticker is required to placed or worn on a highly visible item (uniform, race car, billboard) of every competitor, even if their personal sponsor is in direct competition with the series sponsor. 
* Title sponsor characterizes the most significant contribution to a company in organizing and hosting an event. Often the name of such sponsor is placed next to the name of competition, teams, individual athletes and is associated with it (for example, the logo of a title sponsor is placed in various places around the stadium or track (such as painted in the infield grass / pavement or walls, various places on the field, signboards on the sides of the field, etc.), the name in the title of an auto racing event&#x27;s official name, or the name of an American football college bowl game). In case of title sponsor&#x27;s presence, the general sponsor position may remain free.
* General sponsor is a sponsor that makes one of the largest contributions (in absence of a title sponsor – usually more than 50% of all sponsorship funds raised) and that receives for it the right to use the image of competition as well as extensive media coverage. If necessary, the status of the general sponsor may be supplemented by the general sponsors for certain categories, as well as the main sponsor.
* Team sponsor provides funds for individual teams. The more money provided (primary sponsor vs. secondary sponsor), the larger area and more visible location are allocated. In some instances, the team sponsor may be rotated between the primary and secondary sponsor roles. This usually occurs with auto racing teams that travel over a vast area. A team sponsor may take the primary sponsorship role at a race in an area where they are present, such as a store chain. That sponsor may take a secondary sponsorship role, or not even be on the car, in an area they have little or no presence, or are prohibited by law to sell, such as alcohol or tobacco products. 
* Official sponsor is a sponsor that makes a certain part of raised funds (within 20–25%). Typically, the given status may be granted by category (&quot;official insurance partner&quot;, &quot;official automotive partner&quot;, etc.).
* Technical sponsor is a sponsor which promotes organization of sporting events through the partial or full payment of goods and services (e.g., medical equipment, fitness, organization of transportation and lodging).
* Participating sponsor is a company, the sponsorship fee size of which usually does not exceed 10% of total raised funds..
* Informational sponsor is an organization that provides informational support through media coverage, conducting PR-actions, joint actions, etc.

==Principles==
All sponsorship should be based on contractual obligations between the sponsor and the sponsored party. Sponsors and sponsored parties should set out clear terms and conditions with all other partners involved, to define their expectations regarding all aspects of the sponsorship deal. Sponsorship should be recognisable as such.

The terms and conduct of sponsorship should be based upon the principle of good faith between all parties to the sponsorship. There should be clarity regarding the specific rights being sold and confirmation that these are available for sponsorship from the rights holder. Sponsored parties should have the absolute right to decide on the value of the sponsorship rights that they are offering and the appropriateness of the sponsor with whom they contract.

===Selling===
The sales cycle for selling sponsors is often a lengthy process that consists of researching prospects, creating tailored proposals based on a company&#x27;s business objectives, finding the right contacts at a company, getting buy-in from multiple constituencies and finally negotiating benefits/price. Some sales can take up to a year and sellers report spending anywhere between 1–5 hours researching each company that is viewed as a potential prospect for sponsorship.

===Leveraging and activation===
These are the terms used by many sponsorship professionals, which refer to how a sponsor uses the benefits they are allocated under the terms of a sponsorship agreement. Leveraging has been defined by Weeks, Cornwell and Drennan (2008) as &quot;the act of using collateral marketing communications to exploit the commercial potential of the association between a sponsor and sponsee&quot; while activation has been defined as those &quot;communications that promote the engagement, involvement, or participation of the sponsorship audience with the sponsor.&quot;

Money spent on activation is over and above the rights fee paid to the sponsored property and is often far greater than the cost of the rights fee.&quot;

==Sponsorship markets==

IEG projects spending on sponsorship globally to grow 4.5 percent in 2018 to $65.8 billion, including $24.2 billion in North America alone (a 4.5% increase from $24.1 billion in 2017).
Europe is the largest source of sponsorship spending, with €26.44 million (US$29 million) in just the EU member states in 2014, followed by North America, the Asia Pacific region. Growth in Central and South America during 2010 did not materialize to the extent projected—3.8 percent versus a forecast of 5.7 percent—despite the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games in Brazil in 2014 and 2016, respectively. With the 2010 World Cup concluded, sponsorship activity should begin to heat up, thus the region is projected to be the fastest-growing source of sponsorship dollars outside North America, with a forecast growth rate of 5.6 percent for 2011.

Relaxed television industry legislation surrounding product placement has led to a small but increasing rise in TV programming sponsorship in the UK. However, commercial sponsorship of British sports teams and players is a multibillion-pound industry. For example, Adidas became the sponsor and supplier of Manchester United&#x27;s kit for ten seasons, in a 2014 deal with a guaranteed minimum value of £750 million (more than US$1.1 billion).

As it has in most years over the past two-plus decades, sponsorship&#x27;s growth rate will be ahead of the pace experienced by advertising and sales promotion, according to IEG.

<doc id="545610" wikidata="Q1931500" url="?curid=545610" title="Conference on Disarmament">
<text>The Conference on Disarmament (CD) is a multilateral disarmament forum established by the international community to negotiate arms control and disarmament agreements based at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. The Conference meets annually in three separate sessions in Geneva.

==History==

The Conference was first established in 1979 as the Committee on Disarmament as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community. It was renamed the Conference on Disarmament in 1984.

The Conference succeeded three other disarmament-related bodies: the Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament (1960), the Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament (1962–1968) and the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (1969–1978).

The Conference was created with a permanent agenda, also known as the &quot;Decalogue&quot;, which includes the following topics:
* Nuclear weapons in all aspects
* Other weapons of mass destruction
* Conventional weapons
* Reduction of military budgets
* Reduction of armed forces
* Disarmament and development
* Disarmament and international security
* Collateral measures; confidence building measures; effective verification methods in relation to appropriate disarmament measures, acceptable to all parties
* Comprehensive programme of disarmament leading to general and complete disarmament under effective international control

Additionally, all decisions of the body must be agreed upon by consensus according to the rules and procedures of the conference.

==Relationship to the United Nations==
The Conference is formally independent from the United Nations. However, while it is not formally a UN organization, it is linked to it in various ways. First and foremost, the Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva serves as the Secretary-General of the Conference. Furthermore, while the Conference adopts its own rules of procedure and agenda, the United Nations General Assembly can pass resolutions recommending specific topics to the Conference. Finally, the Conference submits a report of its activities to the General Assembly yearly, or more frequently, as appropriate.

The Conference on Disarmament Secretariat and Conference Support Branch of the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, based in Geneva, provides organizational and substantive servicing to the Conference on Disarmament, the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community.

==Work of the Conference==
Initially, the Conference and its predecessors were successful in meeting their mandate. They were instrumental in drafting numerous arms control agreements: most importantly, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), the Chemical Weapons Convention (1993) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (1996).

However, the work of the body was stalled for over a decade, as members were unable to agree on a work program after the passage of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Difficulties included strained relations between key players, disagreement among members on the prioritization of issues, and attempts of some countries to link progress in one area to parallel progress in other areas.

Then, in 2009 a breakthrough was made by the body when it established several working groups to tackle various topics under the Conference&#x27;s authority. These group focused on: negotiating a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons (FMCT), creating practical steps to reduce nuclear weapons, Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) and addressing negative security assurances.

Due to the general dysfunction of the Conference and its limited membership, negotiations for the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons took place at the United Nations, and not at the Conference.

== Membership ==
The conference is currently composed of 65 formal members, representing all areas of the world, as well as all known nuclear-weapon states. Additionally, members are organized into a number of informal regional groups to facilitate their preparation for, and representation in the plenary meetings of the Conference.

=== Western European and Others Group (WEOG) ===
=== Group of 21 (G-21) ===

=== Eastern European Group (EEG) ===
=== Group of One ===
=== Non-member States ===
Additionally, a number of states participate in meetings of the Conference as Non-member States:

<doc id="545615" wikidata="Q572440" url="?curid=545615" title="Monsieur Verdoux">
<text>Monsieur Verdoux is a 1947 American black comedy film directed by and starring Charlie Chaplin, who plays a bigamist wife killer inspired by serial killer Henri Désiré Landru. The supporting cast includes Martha Raye, William Frawley, and Marilyn Nash.

In the film, a bank teller is fired after three decades of work. The unemployed man still has to financially support his incapacitated wife and their child. He resorts to entering bigamous marriages with wealthy widows, killing each of them in turn. Years later, the con man goes bankrupt and loses his family. During a dinner with an old acquaintance, he is recognized by the family of one of his victims. He is sentenced to death in a murder trial, but compares his relatively few victims to the millions of people killed in wars waged for profit. The film ends with the killer heading to his execution.

==Plot==

Henri Verdoux had been a bank teller for thirty years before being laid off. To support his wheelchair-bound wife and his child, he turns to the business of marrying and murdering wealthy widows. The Couvais family becomes suspicious when Thelma Couvais withdraws all her money and disappears two weeks after marrying a man named &quot;Varnay&quot;, whom they only know through a photograph.

As Verdoux (Chaplin) prepares to sell Thelma Couvais&#x27;s home, the widowed Marie Grosnay (Isobel Elsom) visits. Verdoux sees her as another &quot;business&quot; opportunity and attempts to charm her, but she refuses. Over the following weeks, Verdoux has a flower girl (Barbara Slater) repeatedly send Grosnay flowers. In need of money to invest, Verdoux, as M. Floray, visits Lydia Floray (Margaret Hoffman) and convinces her he is her absent husband. She complains that his engineering job has kept him away too long. That night, Verdoux murders her for her money.

At a dinner party with his real wife and their friend the local chemist, Verdoux asks the chemist about the drug he developed to exterminate animals painlessly. The chemist explains the formula and that he had to stop working on it after the local pharmaceutical board banned it, so Verdoux attempts to recreate the drug.

Shortly thereafter, Verdoux finds The Girl (Marilyn Nash) taking shelter from the rain in a doorway and takes her in. When he finds she was just released from prison and has nowhere to go, he prepares dinner for her with wine laced with his newly developed poison. Before drinking the wine, she thanks him for his kindness, and starts to talk about her husband who died while she was in jail. After she says her husband was a helpless invalid and that made her all the more devoted to him, Verdoux says he thinks there is cork in her wine and replaces it with a glass of unpoisoned wine. She leaves without knowing of his cynical intentions.

Verdoux makes several attempts to murder Annabella Bonheur (Martha Raye), who believes Verdoux to be Bonheur, a sea captain who is frequently away, including by strangulation while boating, and by poisoned wine, but she is impervious, repeatedly escaping death without even realizing while, at the same time, putting Verdoux himself in danger or near death. Meanwhile, Grosnay eventually softens and relents from the continual flowers from Verdoux and invites him to her residence. He convinces her to marry him, and Grosnay&#x27;s friends hold a large public wedding to Verdoux&#x27;s disapproval. Unexpectedly, Annabella Bonheur shows up to the wedding. Panicking, Verdoux fakes a cramp to avoid being seen and eventually deserts the wedding.

In the years leading up to the Second World War, European markets collapse, with the subsequent bank failures causing Verdoux to go bankrupt. The economic crisis leads to rise of fascism across Europe. A few years later, in 1937, with the Spanish Civil War underway, The Girl, now well-dressed and chic, once again finds Verdoux on a street corner in Paris. She invites him to an elegant dinner at a high-end restaurant as a gesture of gratitude for his actions earlier. The girl has married a wealthy munitions executive she does not love to be well-off. Verdoux reveals that he has lost his family. At the restaurant, members of the Couvais family recognize Verdoux and attempt a pursuit. Verdoux delays them long enough to bid the unnamed girl farewell before letting himself be captured by the investigators.

Verdoux is exposed and convicted of murder. When he is sentenced in the courtroom, rather than expressing remorse he takes the opportunity to say that the world encourages mass killers, and that compared to the makers of modern weapons he is but an amateur. Later, before being led from his cell to the guillotine, a journalist (Herb Vigran) asks him for a story with a moral, but he answers evasively, dismissing his killing of a few, for which he has been condemned, as not worse than the killing of many in war, for which others are honored, &quot;Wars, conflict - it&#x27;s all business. One murder makes a villain; millions, a hero. Numbers sanctify, my good fellow!&quot; His last visitor before being taken to be executed is a priest (Fritz Leiber). When guards come to take him to the guillotine he is offered a cigarette, which he refuses, and a glass of rum, which he also refuses before changing his mind. He says &quot;I&#x27;ve never tasted rum&quot;, downs the glass, and the priest begins reciting a prayer in Latin as the guards lead him away and the film ends.

==Production==
Fellow American actor-writer-director Orson Welles received a &#x27;story by&#x27; credit in the film. Chaplin and Welles disagreed on the exact circumstances that led to the film&#x27;s production, although both men agreed that Welles initially approached Chaplin with the idea of having Chaplin star in a film as either a character based on Henri Landru or Landru himself. However, from there, both men&#x27;s stories diverge considerably.

Welles claimed that he was developing a film of his own and was inspired to cast Chaplin as a character based on Landru. Chaplin initially agreed, but he later backed out at the last minute, not wanting to act for another director. Chaplin later offered to buy the script from him, and as Welles was in desperate need of money, he signed away all rights to Chaplin. According to Welles, Chaplin then rewrote several major sections, including the ending; the only specific scene to which Welles laid claim was the opening. Welles acknowledged that Chaplin claimed to have no memory of receiving a script from Welles, and believed Chaplin was telling the truth when he said this.

Chaplin claimed that Welles came to his house with the idea of doing a &quot;series of documentaries, one to be on the celebrated French murderer, Bluebeard Landru&quot;, which he thought would be a wonderful dramatic part for Chaplin. Chaplin was initially interested, as it would provide him with an opportunity for a more dramatic role, as well as saving him the trouble of having to write the film himself. However, Chaplin claimed that Welles then explained that the script had not yet been written and he wanted Chaplin&#x27;s help to do so. As a result, Chaplin dropped out of Welles&#x27;s project. Very shortly thereafter, the idea struck Chaplin that Landru&#x27;s story would make a good comedy. Chaplin then telephoned Welles and told him that, while his new idea had nothing to do with Welles&#x27;s proposed documentary or with Landru, he was willing to pay Welles $5,000 in order to &quot;clear everything&quot;. After negotiations, Welles accepted on the terms that he would receive a &quot;story by&quot; screen credit. Chaplin later stated that he would have insisted on no screen credit at all had he known that Welles would eventually try to take credit for the idea.

==Reception==
This was the first feature film in which Chaplin&#x27;s character bore no resemblance to his famous &quot;Tramp&quot; character (&quot;The Great Dictator&quot; did not feature the Tramp, but his &quot;Jewish barber&quot; bore some similarity). While immediately after the end of World War II there appeared on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean a spate of films, including in 1946 &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;, which drew on so many people&#x27;s experience of loss of loved ones and offered a kind of consolation, &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot; had an unapologetically dark tone, featuring as its protagonist a murderer who feels justified in committing his crimes. Consequently, it was poorly received in America when it premiered there. Moreover, Chaplin&#x27;s popularity and public image had been irrevocably damaged by many scandals and political controversies before its release.

The film had its world premiere at the Broadway Theatre in New York City on April 11, 1947.
Chaplin was subjected to unusually hostile treatment by the press while promoting the opening of the film, and some boycotts took place during its short run. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film was &quot;tediously slow&quot; in many stretches but said that Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;performance is remarkably adroit and that those who assist him, especially Miss Raye, are completely up to snuff.&quot; In New Jersey, the film was picketed by members of the Catholic War Veterans, who carried placards calling for Chaplin to be deported. In Denver, similar protests against the film by the American Legion managed to prevent it being shown. A censorship board in Memphis, Tennessee, banned &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot; outright. At one press conference to promote the film, Chaplin invited questions from the press with the words &quot;Proceed with the butchering&quot;. Richard Coe in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; lauded &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot;, calling it &quot;a bold, brilliant and bitterly amusing film&quot;. James Agee praised the film as well, calling it &quot;a great poem&quot; and &quot;one of the few indispensable works of our time&quot;. Evelyn Waugh praised &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot; as &quot;a startling and mature work of art&quot;, although Waugh also added that he thought &quot;there is a &#x27;message&#x27; and I think, a deplorable one&quot; in the film.

The film was popular in France, where it had admissions of 2,605,679. In 1948, a Parisian named Verdoux and employed in a bank brought an unsuccessful suit against Chaplin, alleging that his coworkers had mocked him for his name during the period of the film&#x27;s advertisement.

Despite its poor commercial performance, the film was nominated for the 1947 Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. It also won the National Board of Review award for Best Film and the Bodil Award for Best American Film. In the decades since its release, &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot; has become more highly regarded. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;Monsieur Verdoux&quot; at No. 112 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. The film was voted at No. 63 on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 2008.

<text>James F. Steranko (; born November 5, 1938) is an American graphic artist, comic book writer/artist, comics historian, magician, publisher and film production illustrator.

His most famous comic book work was with the 1960s superspy feature &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Strange Tales&quot; and in the subsequent eponymous series. Steranko earned lasting acclaim for his innovations in sequential art during the Silver Age of Comic Books, particularly his infusion of surrealism, pop art, and graphic design into the medium. His work has been published in many countries and his influence on the field has remained strong since his comics heyday. He went on to create book covers, become a comics historian who published a pioneering two-volume history of the birth and early years of comic books, and to create conceptual art and character designs for films including &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; and &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;.

He was inducted into the comic-book industry&#x27;s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Early life==
Steranko was born in Reading, Pennsylvania. According to Steranko&#x27;s authorized biography, his grandparents emigrated from Ukraine to settle in the anthracite coal-mining region of eastern Pennsylvania. Steranko&#x27;s father, one of nine siblings, began working in the mines at age 10, and as an adult became a tinsmith. Steranko later said his father and uncles &quot;would bootleg coal – they would go up into a mountain and open up a shaft.&quot; One of three children, all boys, Steranko spent his early childhood during the American Great Depression living in a three-room house with a tar-paper roof and outhouse toilet facilities. He slept on a couch in the nominal living room until he was more than 10 years old. Steranko&#x27;s father and five uncles showed musical inclination, performing in a band that played on Reading radio in the 1930s, Steranko has said.

Steranko recalled beginning school at age 4. Later, &quot;Because my father had tuberculosis (and I tested positive), I began third grade at what was called an &#x27;open-window&#x27; school, a facility across the city that had a healthy program for kids with special problems. I was bused to school for four years, then dropped into standard junior high.&quot; There, being smaller and younger than his classmates, he found himself a target for bullies and young gang-members until he studied boxing and self-defense at the local YMCA and began to successfully fight back. His youngest brother was born when Steranko was 14, &quot;severing even the minimal interaction between me and my parents.&quot;

Steranko had begun drawing while very young, opening and flattening envelopes from the mail to use as sketch paper. Despite his father&#x27;s denigration of Steranko&#x27;s artistic talent, and the boy&#x27;s ambition to become an architect, Steranko paid for his art supplies by collecting discarded soda bottles for the bottle deposit and bundled old newspapers to sell to scrap-paper dealers. He studied the Sunday comic strip art of Milton Caniff, Alex Raymond, Hal Foster, and Chester Gould, as well as the characters of Walt Disney and Superman, provided in &quot;boxes of comics&quot; brought to him by an uncle. Radio programs, Saturday movie matinées and serials, and other popular culture also influenced him.

Steranko in 1978 described some influences and their impact on his creative philosophy:

==Career==
===Illusionist and musician===
By his account, Steranko learned stage magic using paraphernalia from his father&#x27;s stage magician act, and in his teens spent several summers working with circuses and carnivals, working his way up to sideshow performer as a fire-eater and in acts involving a bed of nails and sleight-of-hand. At school, he competed on the gymnastics team, on the rings and parallel bars, and later took up boxing and, under swordmaster Dan Phillips in New York City, fencing. At 17, Steranko and another teenage boy were arrested for a string of burglaries and car thefts in Pennsylvania.
Up through his early 20s, Steranko performed as an illusionist, escape artist, close-up magician in nightclubs, and musician, having played in drum and bugle corps in his teens before forming his own bands during the early days of rock and roll. Steranko, whose first band, in 1956, was called The Lancers, did not perform under his own name, claiming he used pseudonyms to help protect himself from enemies. He also claims to have put the first go-go girls onstage. The seminal rock and roll group Bill Haley and his Comets was based in nearby Philadelphia and Steranko, who played a Jazzmaster guitar, often performed in the same local venues, sometimes on the same bill, and became friendly with Haley guitarist Frank Beecher, who became a musical influence. By the late 1960s, Steranko was a member of a New York City magicians&#x27; group, the Witchdoctor&#x27;s Club.

Comics historian Mark Evanier notes that the influential comic-book creator Jack Kirby, who &quot;based some of his characters ... on people in his life or in the news&quot;, was &quot;inspired&quot; to create the escape artist character Mister Miracle &quot;by an earlier career of writer-artist Jim Steranko&quot;.

===Early art career===
During the day, Steranko made his living as an artist for a printing company in his hometown of Reading, designing and drawing pamphlets and flyers for local dance clubs and the like. He moved on after five years to join an advertising agency, where he designed ads and drew products ranging from &quot;baby carriages to beer cans&quot;. Interested in writing and drawing for comic books, he visited DC Comics as a fan and was treated to a tour of the office by editor Julius Schwartz, who gave Steranko a copy of a script featuring the science-fiction adventurer Adam Strange. Steranko recalled in 2003, &quot;It was the first full script I&#x27;d ever seen, complete with panel descriptions and dialogue. I learned a lot from it and eventually went on to create a few comics of my own.&quot;

He initially entered the comics industry in 1957, not long out of high school, working for a short time inking pencil art by Vince Colletta and Matt Baker in Colletta&#x27;s New York City studio before returning to Reading. In 1966, he landed assignments at Harvey Comics under editor Joe Simon, who as one writer described was &quot;trying to create a line of super heroes within a publishing company that had specialized in anthropomorphic animals.&quot; Here Steranko created and wrote the characters Spyman, Magicmaster and the Gladiator for the company&#x27;s short-lived superhero line, Harvey Thriller. His first published comics art came in &quot;Spyman&quot; #1 (Sept. 1966), for which he wrote the 20-page story &quot;The Birth of a Hero&quot; and penciled the first page, which included a diagram of a robotic hand that was reprinted as an inset on artist George Tuska&#x27;s cover.

Steranko also approached Marvel Comics in 1966. He met with editor Stan Lee, who had Steranko ink a two-page Jack Kirby sample of typical art for the superspy feature &quot;Nick Fury Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; Steranko self-published it in 1970 in the limited-edition &quot;Steranko Portfolio One&quot;; it appeared again 30 years later in slightly altered form in the 2000 trade-paperback collection &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; This led to Lee&#x27;s assigning him the Nick Fury feature in &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, a &quot;split book&quot; that shared each issue with another feature. Future Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas, then a staff writer, recalled,

===Silver Age Steranko===
Lee and Kirby had initiated the 12-page &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; feature in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #135 (Aug. 1965), with Kirby supplying such inventive and enduring gadgets and hardware as the Helicarrier – an airborne aircraft carrier – as well as LMDs (Life Model Decoys) and even automobile airbags. Marvel&#x27;s all-purpose terrorist organization Hydra was introduced here as well.

Steranko began his stint on the feature by penciling and inking &quot;finishes&quot; over Kirby layouts in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #151 (Dec. 1966), just as many fellow new Marvel artists did at the time. Two issues later, Steranko took over full penciling and also began drawing the every-other-issue &quot;Nick Fury&quot; cover art. Then, in a rarity for comics artists of the era, he took over the series&#x27; writing with #155 (April 1967), following Roy Thomas, who had succeeded Lee. In another break with custom, he himself, rather than a Marvel staff artist, had become the series&#x27; uncredited colorist by that issue.

&quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; soon became one of the creative zeniths of the Silver Age, and one of comics&#x27; most groundbreaking, innovative and acclaimed features. Wrote Les Daniels, in his &quot;Comix: A History of Comic Books in America&quot;, &quot;[E]ven the dullest of readers could sense that something new was happening. ... With each passing issue Steranko&#x27;s efforts became more and more innovative. Entire pages would be devoted to photocollages of drawings [that] ignored panel boundaries and instead worked together on planes of depth. The first pages ... became incredible production numbers similar in design to the San Francisco rock concert poster of the period&quot;.

His peers took note of his experimentation. Writer-artist Larry Hama, in an introduction to Nick Fury collection, said Steranko &quot;combined the figurative dynamism of Jack Kirby with modern design concepts&quot;, and recostumed Fury from suits and ties to &quot;a form-fitting bodysuit with numerous zippers and pockets, like a Wally Wood spacesuit revamped by Pierre Cardin. The women were clad in form-fitting black leather a la Emma Peel in the &quot;Avengers&quot; TV show. The graphic influences of Peter Max, Op Art and Andy Warhol were embedded into the design of the pages – and the pages were designed as a whole, not just as a series of panels. All this, executed in a crisp, hard-edged style, seething with drama and anatomical tension.&quot;

Steranko introduced or popularized in comics such art movements of the day as psychedelia and op art, drawing specifically on the &quot;aesthetic of [Salvador] Dalí,&quot; with inspiration from Richard M. Powers, ultimately synthesizing a style he termed &quot;Zap Art.&quot; A.M. Viturtia notes Steranko drew on the James Bond novels, and claims that the influence went both ways: &quot;Although Steranko was primarily influenced by spy movies, after Nick Fury came on the comics scene, the directors of those same movies began to borrow heavily from Steranko himself!&quot; He absorbed, adapted and built upon the groundbreaking work of Jack Kirby, both in the use of photomontage (particularly for cityscapes), and in the use of full- and double-page-spreads. Indeed, in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #167 (Jan. 1968), Steranko created comics&#x27; first four-page spread, upon which panorama he or editor Lee bombastically noted, &quot;to get the full effect, of course, requires a second ish [copy of the issue] placed side-by-side, but we think you&#x27;ll find it to be well worth the price to have the wildest action scene &quot;ever&quot; in the history of comics!&quot; All the while, Steranko spun outlandishly action-filled plots of intrigue, barely sublimated sensuality, and a cool-jazz hi-fi hipness.

Writer Steven Ringgenberg assessed that

She and Steranko&#x27;s other skintight leather-clad version of Bond girls pushed what was allowable under the Comics Code at the time. One example is a silent, one-page seduction sequence with the Countess in &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; #2, described by Robin Green in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;:
When reprinted in &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Who Is Scorpio?&quot; (Marvel Enterprises, 2001; ), however, Steranko&#x27;s original final panel was reinserted: In a black-and-white long shot with screentone shading, the couple is beginning to embrace, with Fury standing and the Countess on one knee, getting up. Another reprinting, in &quot;Marvel Masterworks: Nick Fury Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Volume 2&quot; (Marvel Publishing, 2009; ), used the published final panel, although the appendix included the original art, showing the page as initially drawn. Each instance uses Steranko&#x27;s original telephone panel, not the redrawn published version.

Fury&#x27;s adventures continued in his own series, for which Steranko contributed four 20-page stories: &quot;Who is Scorpio?&quot; (issue #1); &quot;So Shall Ye Reap ... Death&quot; (#2), inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;; &quot;Dark Moon Rise, Hell Hound Kill&quot; (#3), a &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; homage, replete with a Peter Cushing manqué; and the spy-fi sequel &quot;What Ever Happened to Scorpio?&quot; (#5). Yet after deadline pressures forced a fill-in &quot;origin&quot; story by another team in issue #4, Steranko produced merely a handful of additional covers, then dropped the book. Decades afterward, however, their images are among comics&#x27; best known, and homages to his art have abounded – from updates of classic covers with different heroes in place of Fury, to recreations of famous pages and layouts.

Steranko also had short runs on &quot;X-Men&quot; (#50–51, Nov.–Dec. 1968), for which he designed a new cover logo, and &quot;Captain America&quot; (#110–111, 113, Feb.–March, May 1969). Steranko introduced the Madame Hydra character in his brief &quot;Captain America&quot; run. With no new work immediately forthcoming, a &quot;Marvel Bullpen Bulletins&quot; fan page in spring 1969 announced that, &quot;In case you&#x27;ve been wondering what happened to Jaunty Jim Steranko, ... [he] is working on a brand-new feature, which will shortly be spotlighted in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot;. And talk about a secret – he hasn&#x27;t even told &quot;us&quot; what it is!&quot; The referred-to project never appeared.

Steranko went on to write and draw a horror story that precipitated a breakup with Marvel. Though that seven-page tale, &quot;At the Stroke of Midnight&quot;, published in &quot;Tower of Shadows&quot; #1 (Sept. 1969), would win a 1969 Alley Award, editor Lee, who had already rejected Steranko&#x27;s cover for that issue, clashed with Steranko over panel design, dialog, and the story title, initially &quot;The Lurking Fear at Shadow House&quot;. According to Steranko at a 2006 panel and elsewhere, Lee disliked or did not understand the homage to horror author H. P. Lovecraft, and devised his own title for the story. After much conflict, Steranko either quit or was fired. Lee phoned him about a month later, after the two had cooled down.

In a contemporaneous interview, conducted November 14, 1969, Steranko reflected on the tiff:
Summing up this initial stint in comics, Steranko said in 1979,
Steranko returned briefly to Marvel, contributing a romance story (&quot;My Heart Broke in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Our Love Story&quot; #5, Feb. 1970) and becoming the cover artist for 15 comics beginning with &quot;Doc Savage&quot; #2–3, &quot;Shanna the She-Devil&quot; #1–2, and &quot;Supernatural Thrillers&quot; #1–2 (each successively cover-dated Dec. 1972 and Feb. 1973), and ending with the reprint comic &quot;Nick Fury and his Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; #2 (April 1973).

===Publisher and paperback artist===
In 1973, Steranko became founding editor of Marvel&#x27;s official fan magazine, &quot;FOOM&quot;, which superseded the two previous official fan clubs, the Merry Marvel Marching Society and Marvelmania. Steranko served as editor and also produced the covers for the magazine&#x27;s inaugural four issues before being succeeded editorially by Tony Isabella. He had previously been associated with Marvelmania, producing two of the club&#x27;s 12 posters.

Steranko then branched into other areas of publishing, including most notably book-cover illustration. Lacking any experience as a painter, his decision to effectively quit comics in 1969 led him to &quot;an artist friend who earned his living as a painter&quot;, from whom Steranko obtained an &quot;hour-long lecture&quot;, and the suggestion that he work in acrylics rather than oils, for the sake of speed. From these inauspicious beginnings, he compiled a portfolio of half a dozen paintings (&quot;two Westerns, two pin-up girls, two gothic horror and one sword-and-sorcery&quot;) and met with Lancer Books&#x27; art director Howard Winters, to whom he immediately sold his fantasy piece. This led to a career illustrating dozens of paperback covers, popularly including those of Pyramid Books&#x27; reissues of the 1930s pulp novels of &quot;The Shadow&quot;. When DC Comics gained the comic book publishing rights to The Shadow, they contacted Steranko to work on the new series but ultimately chose Dennis O&#x27;Neil and Michael Kaluta to produce the title instead.

Steranko also formed his own publishing company, Supergraphics, in 1969, and the following year worked with writer-entrepreneur Byron Preiss on an anti-drug comic book, &quot;The Block&quot;, distributed to elementary schools nationwide. In 1970 and 1972, Supergraphics published two tabloid-sized volumes entitled &quot;The Steranko History of Comics&quot;, a planned six-volume history of the American comics industry, though no subsequent volumes have appeared. Written by Steranko, with hundreds of black-and-white cover reproductions as well as a complete reprint of one &quot;The Spirit&quot; story by Will Eisner, it included some of the first and in some cases only interviews with numerous creators from the 1930s and 1940s Golden Age of Comic Books.

Supergraphics projects included the proposed &quot;Talon the Timeless&quot;, illustrations of which appeared in a portfolio published in &quot;witzend&quot; magazine #5, and a pinup girl calendar, &quot;The Supergirls&quot;, consisting of 12 illustrations of sexy superheroines in costumes recalling such superheroes as Captain America and Green Lantern. Through Supergraphics he also published the magazine &quot;Comixscene&quot;, which premiered with a December 1972 cover date as a folded-tabloid periodical on stiff, non-glossy paper, reporting on the comics field. It evolved in stages into &quot;Mediascene&quot; (beginning with issue #7, Dec. 1973) and ultimately into &quot;Prevue&quot; (beginning with #41, Aug. 1980), a general-interest, standard format, popular culture magazine, running through 1994. 
Fantagraphics publisher Gary Groth recounts his time living with and working for Sterkano and &quot;Prevue&quot; in Reading, PA during a Cartoonist Kayfabe YouTube interview in May 2020.

Steranko wrote, drew, and produced the illustrated novel &quot;&quot; in 1976, for Byron Preiss Visual Publications / Pyramid Books. Aside from occasional covers and pinup illustrations, he has rarely worked in comics since, although he did illustrate a serialized comics adaptation of the Peter Hyams 1981 sci-fi thriller &quot;Outland&quot; for &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; magazine. His only major work for DC Comics appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; #400 (Oct. 1984), the 10-page story &quot;The Exile at the Edge of Eternity,&quot; which he wrote, drew, colored and lettered. A 1997 attempt to negotiate Steranko&#x27;s return to S.H.I.E.L.D. did not bear fruit. In 2008, he worked with Radical Comics, doing covers, character and logo designs for its &quot;Hercules: The Thracian Wars&quot; title and &quot;Ryder on the Storm&quot;. In 2012, he did poster art for RZG Comics and a variant cover for DC&#x27;s &quot;Before Watchmen: Rorschach&quot; #1. Steranko drew the 1970s variant cover for &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1000 (June 2018).

===Film and television work===
For the film industry, Steranko has done sketches and preliminary paintings for movie posters, including for the 1977 &quot;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&quot; and was a conceptual artist on Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), doing production designs for the film and designing the character of Indiana Jones. He also served in a similar capacity as &quot;project conceptualist&quot; on Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992), and wrote the episode &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; of the DC Comics animated TV series &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (2004-2006).

In 2003, Steranko was interviewed by the History Channel for the documentary titled &quot;Comic Book Superheroes Unmasked&quot;.

He has &quot;amassed an enormous portfolio of more than sixty projects (which he called the &#x27;Theater of Concepts&#x27;) designed to be seen in multimedia form&quot;.

===Philanthropy===
In a joint venture with Marvel Comics and Diamond Comic Distributors, Vanguard Productions in 2002 sponsored Steranko&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit of America&quot; benefit print, created to fund an art scholarship &quot;for victims of anti-American terrorism&quot;.

<doc id="545618" wikidata="Q1474229" url="?curid=545618" title="Pan-pan">
<text>The radiotelephony message PAN-PAN is the international standard urgency signal that someone aboard a boat, ship, aircraft, or other vehicle uses to declare that they need help and that the situation is urgent, but for the time being, does not pose an immediate danger to anyone&#x27;s life or to the vessel itself. This is referred to as a state of &quot;urgency&quot;. This is distinct from a mayday call (distress signal), which means that there is imminent danger to life or to the continued viability of the vessel itself. Radioing &quot;pan-pan&quot; informs potential rescuers (including emergency services and other craft in the area) that an urgent problem exists, whereas &quot;mayday&quot; calls on them to drop all other activities and immediately begin a rescue.

The exact representation of PAN in Morse code is the urgency signal XXX (), which was first defined by the International Radiotelegraph Convention of 1927.

==Etymology==
As with &quot;mayday&quot; (from , &quot;come help me&quot;), the urgency signal pan-pan derives from French. In French, a is a breakdown, such as a mechanical failure. In English, it is sometimes pronounced as and sometimes as .

A three-letter backronym, &quot;possible assistance needed&quot; or &quot;pay attention now&quot;, derives from &quot;pan&quot;. Maritime and aeronautical radio communications courses use those as mnemonics to convey the important difference between mayday and pan-pan.

==Usage==
To declare pan-pan correctly, the caller repeats it three times: &quot;Pan-pan, pan-pan, pan-pan&quot;, then states the intended recipient, either &quot;all stations, all stations, all stations&quot;, or a specific station, e.g. &quot;Victoria Coast Guard Radio, Victoria Coast Guard Radio, Victoria Coast Guard Radio&quot;. Then the caller states their craft&#x27;s identification, position, nature of the problem, and the type of assistance or advice they require, if any.

===Medical transports===
The phrase &quot;PAN-PAN MEDICAL&quot; is reserved for medical transports. It is used to announce and identify medical transports.

===Medical advice===

One special case of &quot;pan-pan&quot; is to ask for medical advice. This is a normal &quot;pan-pan&quot; call that includes a phrase such as &quot;request medical advice&quot; and the craft identification, position, and nature of the medical problem. It should not be confused with the term &quot;PAN-PAN MEDICAL&quot; which is reserved for medical transports.

This type of call is specifically for getting a physician&#x27;s advice for a medical problem that does not, in the opinion of the skipper or master of the vessel, seem life-threatening. The phrase &quot;pan-pan medico&quot; appears in some older reference books, but is not a correct usage.

Once patched through, a physician or other medical expert on land or in another vessel typically asks the radio operator to detail the symptoms and history of the condition, and provide any available patient medical history. The physician typically recommends first aid treatment and gives other advice based on what resources are available on board. In some cases, the medical issue may be urgent enough to escalate the pan-pan to a mayday call for immediate intervention by rescuers, if possible.

===Nautical uses===
Examples of the correct use of a &quot;pan-pan&quot; call from a boat or ship may include the following cases, provided the skipper or master remains confident they can handle the situation, and that there is no current danger to the life of any person or to the safety of the vessel. Once the urgent situation that led to the pan-pan broadcast is resolved or contended with, conventional practice is for the station that initiated the pan-pan call to make a followup broadcast to all stations, declaring that the urgent situation no longer exists.

A call that originates as a &quot;pan-pan&quot; signal might be followed by a mayday distress signal if the situation deteriorates to the point of &quot;grave and imminent danger&quot;, thus warranting immediate action (intervention, assistance, response) on the part of listeners in accordance with standard operating practices for distress signaling.

; Fouled propeller, engine failure or out of fuel: Provided the vessel is now either anchored or under sail and safe from any immediate danger of collision or stranding. The crew may plan to clear the propeller, refuel from an onboard supply, hoist sail, or use alternative propulsion. Alternatively, as part of the pan-pan call, the skipper may request a tow from a suitable vessel, if possible, but without immediate urgency.
; Small fire on board – now extinguished: Fire is dangerous afloat, but if it was small and contained, and is now certainly put out, and with no injury to people, then a &quot;pan-pan&quot; call is appropriate to warn others that investigations are underway to establish the extent of the damage, clear the smoke from below, and re-establish passage as soon as possible.
; Unsure of position: Provided there is no apparent danger of stranding or hitting rocks, a pan-pan call on marine VHF radio may allow nearby coast-stations, and perhaps other vessels, to triangulate the source of the transmissions and provide a fix and perhaps offer advice on the best course to safety.
; Man-overboard recovery: In a man overboard situation, a pan-pan call on VHF makes other nearby vessels aware of the situation and ensures that they keep a lookout, avoid coming too close, avoid excessive wake or otherwise interfering. It also alerts them that the recovery vessel is manoeuvring for urgent life-saving, and therefore may not manoeuvre in accordance with International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS). In a more critical situationthe recovery vessel has lost sight of the person overboard, the person overboard is unconscious, there is a danger of hypothermia, or other grave risk to lifea mayday call is more appropriate, so that other nearby vessels can help rather than keep clear.
; Overdue vessel: The Canadian and U.S. Coast Guards (and likely similar maritime safety agencies in other countries) issue &quot;urgent marine information broadcasts&quot; concerning vessels reported overdue, as part of the process of a &#x27;communications search&#x27; or &#x27;pre-com&#x27; phase of uncertain, possible distress, as determined under the authority of a maritime rescue co-ordination centre or joint maritime-aeronautical rescue co-ordination centre. The message content, a description of the vessel under the apprehension of being missing, its last known position, the date or time last heard from, and the supposed route or passage plan of the vessel, is preceded by the procedure words pan-pan and is addressed to &quot;all stations&quot;. Any stations having information concerning the whereabouts of the named vessel are asked to communicate with and report same to the nearest coast guard station.
; Imminent collision alert: A pan-pan call is warranted to attempt urgent radio contact with an approaching vessel that may be in danger or is approaching a dangerous close-quarters situation that would risk collision. This would be a &#x27;bridge-to-bridge&#x27; communication, and could be combined with five or more short horn or whistle blasts, which is the &quot;Your intentions are unclear or not understood&quot; signal. A short blast is one second long, compared to a prolonged blast of four to six seconds under the COLREGS. An urgent warning could also be given over the radio, for example, if the called vessel appears unaware that it is at risk of striking a person in a small boat or a swimmer. A loud hailer could also be used along with a radio warning.
; Medical assistance: Any immediate risk to life makes a mayday call more appropriate. If the vessel is heading to shore and wants an ambulance crew at the dock, the local Coast Guard station can arrange this. A physician or other trained medical advisor may also be available on the radio, perhaps by patching through via telephone from ashore or from a nearby vessel. The UK Radiocommunications Authority at one time promulgated a &quot;pan-pan medico&quot; call for cases where someone needed medical help at sea. However, this was never an international procedure word and is not part of the ITU Radio Regulations or related international standards (e.g. International Maritime Organization or ICAO procedures).

Marine rescue organisations, such as Coastal Patrol, Coast Guard, and Search and Rescue listen on marine radio frequencies for all distress calls including &quot;pan-pan&quot;. These organisations can coordinate or assist and can relay such calls to other stations that may be better able to do so.

===Aeronautical uses===

Aeronautical situations that require urgent assistance but do not pose an immediate threat to life include:
*Becoming lost
*A serious aircraft system failure, that requires an immediate route or altitude change
*An engine failure in a multi-engine aircraft where the aircraft is still able to maintain altitude

Pan-pan calls may be made on the aircraft emergency frequency, but they are more often made on the frequency already in use, or another appropriate frequency.

ICAO Annex 10, Volume V, § 4.1.3.1.1 states &quot;the emergency channel (121.5 MHz) shall be used only for genuine emergency purposes&quot;. However, ICAO member states can deviate from this rule. In the United Kingdom, pilots may make &quot;practice PAN&quot; or &quot;training fix&quot; calls. Practice mayday calls are not permitted.

<text>Celeriac (Apium graveolens&quot; Rapaceum Group, synonyms Apium graveolens&quot; Celeriac Group and Apium graveolens&quot; var. &quot;rapaceum), also called celery root, knob celery, and turnip-rooted celery (although it is not a close relative of the turnip), is a group of cultivars of &quot;Apium graveolens&quot; cultivated for their edible bulb-like hypocotyl, and shoots.

Celeriac is widely cultivated in the Mediterranean Basin and in Northern Europe. It is also but less commonly cultivated in North Africa, Siberia, Southwest Asia, and North America.

== History ==

Wild celery (&quot;Apium graveolens&quot;), from which both celeriac and celery derive, originated in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. It was mentioned in the &quot;Iliad&quot; 
and &quot;Odyssey&quot; 
as . Celeriac was grown as a medicinal crop in some early civilizations.

==Culinary use==

Typically, celeriac is harvested when its hypocotyl is in diameter. This is white on the inside, and can be kept for months in winter. It often serves as a key ingredient in soup. It can also be shredded and used in salads. The leaves are used as seasoning; the small, fibrous stalks find only marginal use.

The shelf life of celeriac is approximately six to eight months if stored between , and not allowed to dry out. However, the vegetable will tend to rot through the centre if the finer stems surrounding the base are left attached. The centre of celeriac becomes hollow as it ages, though even freshly harvested celeriacs can have a small medial hollow. The freshness will also be obvious from the taste; the older it is, the weaker the celery flavour.

<text>Peter John Veniot, (October 4, 1863 – July 6, 1936) was a businessman and newspaper owner and a politician in New Brunswick, Canada. He was the first Acadian premier of New Brunswick.

==Early life and career==
He was born in Richibucto, New Brunswick but later moved to Pictou, Nova Scotia with his family. Veniot worked as a journalist and typographer for the &quot;Pictou Standard&quot; and then the &quot;Moncton Transcript&quot;. He then moved to Bathurst, where he became editor and later owner of &quot;Le Courrier des Provinces Maritimes&quot;.

==Political career==
Veniot was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 1894, but left politics in 1900 for a customs job. In 1912, he was hired to reorganize the Liberal Party of New Brunswick, and became a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) again in 1917.

He served in the cabinet of Premier Walter Foster as Minister of Public Works. As Minister, Veniot was responsible for the creation of the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission and the modernization of the province&#x27;s highway system.

Veniot became Premier in 1923 following Foster&#x27;s resignation. He was a supporter of the Maritime Rights Movement or Duncan Commission, which advocated more power for the Maritime provinces in Canadian confederation. His government was defeated in the 1925 provincial election.

Veniot resigned as provincial Liberal leader in 1926 in order to enter federal politics in the 1926 federal election. He served as Postmaster General in the cabinet of William Lyon Mackenzie King. In cabinet, Veniot advocated implementation of the Duncan Commission recommendations on alleviating Maritime alienation. Recommendations of freight-rate reductions and subsidy increases were implemented, but suggestions for subsidies based on fiscal need and transportation use to encourage regional development were ignored.

==Death==
Veniot remained a Member of Parliament until his death at his home in Bathurst in 1936.

==Personal life==
Married in 1885 to Catherine Melanson, their son Clarence Joseph was elected in the federal riding of Gloucester by-election after his death. He and his wife are interred in Bathurst, in the cemetery adjacent to the offices of the newspaper that made his fortune.

<doc id="545643" wikidata="Q1437952" url="?curid=545643" title="Forrest Sherman-class destroyer">
<text>The 18 &quot;Forrest Sherman&quot;-class destroyers comprised the first post-war class of US destroyers. Commissioned beginning in 1955, these ships served until the late 1980s. Their weaponry underwent considerable modification during their years of service. Four were converted to guided-missile destroyers. This class also served as the basis for the guided-missile destroyers.

Two ships of the class became museum ships, nine were sunk in training exercises, and the others were scrapped. 

==Construction==
Nine ships were constructed by Bath Iron Works of Bath, Maine, five were built by Bethlehem Steel at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, two were built by Ingalls Shipbuilding at Pascagoula, Mississippi and two were built by Puget Sound Bridge and Dredging Company in Seattle, Washington. These destroyers were assigned hull numbers 931 to 951, but the series skipped over the numbers used to designate the war prizes DD-934 (the Japanese ex-&quot;Hanazuki&quot;), DD-935 (the German &quot;T35&quot;), and DD-939 (the German &quot;Z39&quot;). DD-927 to DD-930 were completed as destroyer leaders.

==Description==
At the time they entered service, these ships were the largest US destroyers ever built, long, with a standard displacement of . Originally designed under project SCB 85, they were armed with three /54 caliber guns mounted in single turrets (one forward and two aft), 4 /50 caliber AA guns in twin mounts, as well as hedgehogs and torpedoes for ASW. However, over the years, weaponry was considerably modified. The hedgehogs and guns were removed from all ships during the 1960s and 1970s. In addition the fixed torpedo tubes were replaced by two triple Mark 32 torpedo tube mounts. 

 and later ships were built under SCB 85A with their fire control directors reversed from the SCB 85 configuration. They were equipped with B&amp;W Bailey Meter Company&#x27;s new automatic boiler combustion control system, and a modified hurricane bow/anchor configuration. These ships are listed as &quot;Hull&quot;-class destroyers in some references.
===DDG conversions===
Four of the destroyers—, , , and —were converted to guided-missile destroyers under SCB 240, armed with Tartar missiles.

===ASW Modernization===
Eight of the class were modernized to improve their ASW capabilities under SCB 251: &quot;Barry&quot;, &quot;Davis&quot;, &quot;Jonas Ingram&quot;, &quot;Manley&quot;, &quot;Du Pont&quot;, &quot;Blandy&quot;, &quot;Hull&quot;, and &quot;Morton&quot;; these ships became known as the Barry sub-class. These ships were fitted with an eight cell ASROC launcher in place of the No. 2 5-inch (127 mm) gun, and with a variable-depth sonar system. Six other ship modernizations were cancelled due to Vietnam War budget constraints.

===8&quot;/55 Mark 71 gun test===
As a test platform, the &quot;Hull&quot; carried the Navy&#x27;s prototype 8&quot;/55 caliber Mark 71 light-weight gun from 1975 to 1978 when the program was canceled, and the 5-inch mount was restored. &quot;Hull&quot; remains the only modern (post–World War II) destroyer-type ship to have carried an gun.

==Disposition==
Of the 18 completed, nine were disposed of in fleet training exercises, seven were sold by Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for scrapping, and two became museums.

<text>was a town located in Yatsuka District, Shimane Prefecture, Japan.

== Population ==
As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 6,063 and a density of 164.58 per km2. The total area was 36.84 km2.

== History ==
On March 31, 2005, Tamayu, along with the towns of Kashima, Mihonoseki, Shimane, Shinji and Yatsuka, and the village of Yakumo (all from Yatsuka District), was merged into the expanded city of Matsue.

== Attractions ==
It is noted for its hot spring, Tamatsukuri Onsen (&quot;Tamatsukuri&quot; meaning making of tama jewelry in ancient times.) The jewelry made there was mined on Mt. Kasensan. Noted for its production of Menou or Agate, a green quartz stone, this stone is one of the three gifts given to each newly crowned Emperor. 

The Onsen is recognized in the oldest of all Japanese history books. Today, it is a tourist destination for Japanese living in the western part of the country, although it is famous all over Japan. It hosts the famous Onsen Matsuri, a summer festival that draws thousands of visitors each year, followed by a parade and beautiful sunsets on Lake Shinji. There are a couple of small temples and shrines that give a great perspective on regular warm Japanese people.

== Dialect ==
The Japanese dialect spoken here is Izumo-ben or Izumo dialect which can be difficult to understand but the people are warm and understanding.

<text>Walter Edward Foster (April 9, 1873 – November 14, 1947) was a Canadian politician and businessman in New Brunswick.

== Early life ==

Foster was born in St. Martins, New Brunswick. He began work as a clerk with the Bank of New Brunswick at Saint John. He joined the merchant firm of Vassie and Company and became vice president and managing director after marrying Johanna Vassie, daughter of the firm&#x27;s head. Active in community business affairs, Foster served as President of the Saint John Board of Trade in 1908–1909.

== Political career == 

In 1916, Walter Foster became leader of the province&#x27;s Liberal Party which swept to victory in the 1917 election. Foster was defeated in the Saint John County riding in the 1917 election but was elected to the Legislative Assembly by acclamation in a by-election later that year in Victoria County. Though leader at age 45, he was called the &quot;boy premier&quot; for his youthful, cleancut appearance (Doyle). His government established the first department of health in 1918, gave women the right to vote in 1919 and created the province&#x27;s power commission in 1920.

Walter Foster resigned from provincial politics on February 1, 1923 in order to return to put his own failing personal finances in order. He entered federal politics becoming Secretary of State of Canada in 1925, but failed to win a seat in that year&#x27;s federal election.

In 1928, Walter Foster was appointed by Prime Minister Mackenzie King to the Senate of Canada and served as Speaker of the Senate of Canada from 1936 to 1940. 

== Personal life and death ==

Foster married Joanna Vassie in 1903. His son, Walter William Vassie Foster, served in the provincial Legislative Assembly.

He died in office in Saint John at the age of 74 and was buried in the Cedar Hill Cemetery.

<text>George Bryan Porter (February 9, 1791 – July 6, 1834) was an American statesman in Pennsylvania and Territorial governor of Michigan from August 6, 1831, until his death on July 6, 1834.

==Early life==
Born in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Porter attended the Norristown Academy. While he and his two brothers were preparing to enter college, there was a student &quot;rebellion&quot; at Princeton University and many school buildings had been burned. As a result, Porter and his brothers continued their studies in their father&#x27;s library rather than at Princeton.

==Career==
Porter was a major in the United States Army during the War of 1812. He attended Litchfield Law School in Litchfield, Connecticut, and was admitted to the bar in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in 1813. He served as Prothonotary (Chief Court Clerk) in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in 1818.

A lawyer in Lancaster, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, Porter eventually entered state politics. He served as Adjutant General from 1824 to 1829; became a Democratic party member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1827.

Porter was United States Marshall for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in 1831. Appointed by President Andrew Jackson in 1831, Porter served as the Territorial Governor of Michigan from 1832 until his death in 1834. In this role he accompanied Oneida chief Daniel Bread to the White House to ask President Jackson for alternative land arrangements for the Oneida in response to the 1831 Treaty of Washington, which along with the 1927 Treaty of Butte Morts had reduced Oneida lands by 90%. The trip was successful in that the president agreed to exchange Oneida lands for &quot;better, more fertile&quot; lands.

==Death==
Porter died while in office on July 6, 1834, during a cholera epidemic in Detroit, Michigan. He is interred at Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit.

A portrait of Porter was unveiled in November 2015 and hangs on the second floor of the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing.

==Family life==
Porter married Sarah Humes of Pennsylvania on October 31, 1816, and had at least four children, one of whom was General Andrew Porter, one of the generals at the First Battle of Bull Run, who married Margarite Biddle of the famous Biddle family.

Porter was the son of Andrew Porter who served in the U.S. Revolutionary War, and Elizabeth Parker Porter. He was also the brother of David Rittenhouse Porter, Pennsylvania Governor 1839–1845, and James Madison Porter, Secretary of War 1843–1844, and the uncle of Horace Porter, U.S. Ambassador to France 1897–1905.

<text>The Central Bank of Malaysia (BNM; ; Jawi: ) is the Malaysian central bank. Established on 26 January 1959 as the Central Bank of Malaya (&quot;Bank Negara Tanah Melayu&quot;), its main purpose is to issue currency, act as the banker and advisor to the government of Malaysia, and to regulate the country&#x27;s financial institutions, credit system and monetary policy. Its headquarters is located in Kuala Lumpur, the federal capital of Malaysia.

The Bank is the only institution permitted to issue the Malaysian ringgit into circulation.

==Governors==

== Headquarters and branches ==

The Central Bank headquarters are located at Jalan Sultan Salahuddin, off Jalan Kuching.

Landmarks located near the Central Bank building include Dataran Merdeka, St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Kuala Lumpur City Hall building, Lake Gardens, Kuala Lumpur and the Tugu Negara.

The Central Bank had previously maintained branches in each of the state capitals. Most of them were closed in the 1990s when retail banks began taking over most of the counter services. There are still branches maintained in Penang, Johor Bahru, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Kuala Terengganu and Shah Alam. Some branches were converted into currency distribution and processing centres.

The Central Bank also retains representative offices in London, New York City, and Beijing.

A new building for the Financial Services and Resources Center (FSRC) was constructed in 2004 to house the FSRC, SEACEN, IFSB and the FMAG (the museum arm of BNM). Located along Jalan Dato Onn, the building was designed by renowned Malaysian architect firm, Hijjas Kasturi Associates. Officially declared opened in August 2011, the building is now known as Sasana Kijang.

== History ==

In 1837 the Indian rupee was made the sole official currency in the Straits Settlements, but in 1867 silver dollars were again legal tender. In 1903 the Straits dollar, pegged at two shillings and fourpence (2s. 4d.), was introduced by the Board of Commissioners of Currency for the Straits Settlements and private banks were prevented from issuing notes. Since then, there were two lapses in the continuity of the currency, first by the Japanese occupation (1942–1945), and again by the devaluation of the Pound Sterling in 1967 when notes of the Board of Commissioners of Currency, Malaya and British Borneo lost 15% of their value.

On 12 June 1967, the Malaysian dollar, issued by the new central bank, Central Bank of Malaysia, replaced the Malaya and British Borneo dollar at par. The new currency retained all denominations of its predecessor except the $10,000 denomination, and also brought over the colour schemes of the old dollar.

In 1985, following the &quot;Plaza meeting&quot; of G-5 finance ministers in New York City, the US dollar fell sharply causing major losses in Central Bank&#x27;s dollar reserves. The bank responded by starting a program of aggressive speculative trading to make up these losses. Jaffar Hussein, the Central Bank Governor at the time, referred to this strategy as &quot;honest-to-God trading&quot; in a December 1988 speech in New Delhi.

In the late 1980s, Central Bank, under Governor Jaffar Hussein, was a major player in the forex market. Its activities caught the attention of many; initially, Asian markets came to realise the influence the Central Bank had on the direction of forex market. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve&#x27;s chairman, later realised BNM&#x27;s massive speculation activities and requested the Malaysian central bank to cease those activities.

On 21 September 1990, BNM sold between $500 million to $1 billion worth of pound sterling in a short period of time, driving the pound down 4 cents to the dollar. In response, bankers began front running the Central Bank&#x27;s orders. Two years later on Black Wednesday, BNM attempted to defend the value of the British pound against attempts by George Soros and others to devalue the pound sterling. George Soros won and BNM reportedly suffered losses of more than US$4 billion. The Central Bank lost an additional $2.2 billion in speculative trading a year later. By 1994, the bank became technically insolvent and was bailed out by the Malaysian Finance Ministry.

===Pegging of the ringgit and reserves===

In 1998, Central Bank pegged RM3.80 ringgit to the US dollar after the ringgit substantially depreciated during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. In July 2005, the central bank abandoned fixed exchange rate regime in favour of managed floating exchange rate system an hour after China floated its own currency. This resulted in capital flight of more than US$10 billion, thought to be due to the repatriation of speculative funds that entered the country in anticipation of the abandonment of the peg: Central Bank&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves increased by $24 billion in the one-year period between July 2004 and July 2005 (see table below). During this period there was widespread belief that the ringgit was undervalued and that if the peg was removed, the ringgit would appreciate.

The Central Bank continues to run a negative interest rate differential to the USD. The ringgit has appreciated gradually since the peg was abandoned and as at 28 May 2007, it traded at around RM3.40 to the US dollar. Malaysia&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves have increased steadily since the initial capital flight, and as at 31 March 2007 the reserves stood at approximately US$88 billion, which is approximately $10 billion more than the reserves just prior to the peg being abandoned.

On 31 July 2007, the Malaysian reserves stood at approximately US$98.5 billion, which is equivalent to RM340.1 billion. The figure increased to US$101.3 billion on 31 December 2007, which is equivalent to RM335.7 billion. Central Bank&#x27;s international reserves increased further 15 days later to US$104.3 billion or RM345.4 billion.

=== Project Nexus ===
The Bank for International Settlements signed an agreement with Central Bank of Malaysia, Bank of Thailand, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Reserve Bank of India on 30 June 2024 as founding member of Project Nexus, a multilateral international initiative to enable retail cross-border payments. Bank Indonesia involved as a special observer. The platform, which is expected to go live by 2026, will interlink domestic fast payment systems of the member countries.

<text>The Battle of Mons Lactarius (also known as Battle of the Vesuvius) took place in 552 or 553 AD during the Gothic War waged on behalf of Justinian I against the Ostrogoths in Italy.

After the Battle of Taginae, in which the Ostrogoth king Totila was killed, the Byzantine general Narses captured Rome and besieged Cumae. Teia, the new Ostrogothic king, gathered the remnants of the Ostrogothic army and marched to relieve the siege, but in October 552 (or early 553) Narses ambushed him at &quot;Mons Lactarius&quot; (modern Monti Lattari) in Campania, near Mount Vesuvius and Nuceria Alfaterna. The battle lasted two days, and Teia was killed in the fighting. Ostrogothic power in Italy was eliminated, and many of the remaining Ostrogoths went north and (re)settled in south Austria. After the battle, Italy was again invaded, this time by the Franks, but they too were defeated and the peninsula was, for a brief period of time, reintegrated into the Empire. This brief period of Roman rule was brought to an end by the invasion of the Lombards, a Germanic tribe, in 568.

<text>is a village located on in the Dōzen group of islands in the Oki District, Shimane Prefecture, Japan. Chibu is the only village remaining in Shimane Prefecture as of October 1, 2005. As of Japan&#x27;s 2010 census, the village has a population of 657 people, constituting 326 households, and a population density of about 48 persons per km2. This is a decrease of 68 people (9.4%) from the previous census conducted in 2005. A population estimate from March 2011 placed Chibu&#x27;s population at 656 people, 334 men and 322 women.

==Geography==
Chibu is located on , the smallest of the Dōzen group of islands, and includes 18 smaller uninhabited islands located nearby waters. 
The Dōzen islands were formed from a single ancient volcanic island. The caldera of the volcano collapsed, leaving three main islands in a ring formation.

===Climate===
Located on an island located in the Sea of Japan, Chibu is within the Sea of Japan climate zone. Summer temperatures, though usually mild, are exacerbated by high humidity. Winter temperatures are also generally mild, though exacerbated by strong wind. The surrounding ocean has a warming effect, making winters milder than the mainland. Consequently, there is very little snow in Chibu, and what snow does fall usually melts quickly.

The nearest weather station is located in Ama on the nearby island of Nakanoshima. Chibu&#x27;s average annual high and low temperatures are 17.6 °C (64 °F) and 10.5 °C (51 °F), with yearly mean of 14.4 °C (58 °F).

Chibujima was composed of 7 hamlets: , , , , , , and , which were united to form Chibu Village in 1909. The village is served by a sea port located in Kurii which provides ship transportation among the three islands of the Dozen group, to Okinoshima, and to the mainland. There is also a heliport for medical emergencies.

===Festivals and events===
:is a festival held bi-annually, usually at the end of July. This festival is common throughout Japan, and the main event is carrying a &quot;mikoshi&quot; through the town. The home temple for this is Chibu&#x27;s . Another common event during this festival is &quot;kodomo kabuki&quot;, or children&#x27;s &quot;kabuki&quot;. Chibu&#x27;s tradition has it that there was once a serious sickness on Chibu, and, after it passed, dances and &quot;kabuki&quot; were performed by children in celebration.

; and 
:are common events throughout Japan usually held in November and October, respectively. In many other places, towns and schools may hold their own separate events. However, in Chibu the village and school combine because of the small population.
:is an event that, like &quot;Odaishi-san mawari&quot;, was more common in the past, but is less common now. A rope (or “snake”) is braided from dried rice-straw, and wrapped around a tree. This for good luck in the year&#x27;s harvest, and usually is done in the fall.
:is a small traditional festival not unique to Chibu held in October for good luck in the harvest and safety for marine vessels. Drums are played and a dance is performed to send luck to the town.
:is a festival held in April for a beef-cattle show and to kick off the tourist season. Typical events in the festival are a cow show, karaoke contest, performances by elementary and kindergarten children, local folk songs called , and occasionally hired music talent. Festival food is also sold such as Oki beef, oysters, and &quot;yakisoba &quot;.
:is a festival that was celebrated commonly across Japan in the past, but is recently becoming rarer. In the past, a famous monk named Kōbō-Daishi traveled throughout Japan and founded many temples. The festival started as a way for people to &quot;copy&quot; him by visiting various small temples in their town. Usually food is available at each location for visitors. The food is made by married women who often start preparing the food early in the morning. In Chibu, this festival is usually held in April.

<text>Pinus leiophylla, commonly known as Chihuahua pine, smooth-leaf pine, and yellow pine (in Mexico, tlacocote and ocote chino), is a tree with a range primarily in Mexico, with a small extension into the United States in southeast Arizona and southwest New Mexico. The Mexican range extends along the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre del Sur from Chihuahua to Oaxaca, from 29° North Lat. to 17°, between 1600 and 3000 meters altitude. It requires about a rainfall 600 to 1000 mm a year, mostly in summer. It tolerates frosts in winter.

==Description==
This member of family Pinaceae grows to the height of with a trunk diameter of . The needles are in bundles of three to five, long, or rarely to , and are a bright glossy green to yellowish-green. The cones are ovoid, long, or rarely to , and borne on a long stalk; they are unusual in taking about 30–32 months to mature, a year longer than most other pines. The bark is gray-brownish, and fissured.

==Subspecies==
There are two subspecies (treated by some botanists as distinct species, by others as just varieties):
*&quot;Pinus leiophylla&quot; subsp. &quot;leiophylla&quot;. Needles slender (0.5–0.9 mm), in fives. It occurs in the southern part of the range, from Oaxaca to Durango, is not frost tolerant, and grows in relatively high rainfall conditions.
*&quot;Pinus leiophylla&quot; subsp. &quot;chihuahuana&quot;. Needles stouter (0.9–1.3 mm), in threes. It occurs in the northern part of the range, from Durango to Arizona, tolerates frost down to about −10 °C to −15 °C, and very dry conditions. The needle differences are adaptations to these harsher conditions. Synonyms &quot;Pinus chihuahuana&quot;, &quot;Pinus leiophylla&quot; var. &quot;chihuahuana&quot;.

==Habitat and ecology==
This species often grows in mixed in stands with several other pines and/or junipers, in Arizona most often with Apache Pine and Alligator Juniper, but also grows in pure stands. Its habitat is prone to wildfire, and the species shows some adaptations unusual among pines to cope with this; if the crown is destroyed by fire, the trunk, protected by its thick bark, will send out new shoots to re-grow a new crown. The only other pines to do this are Pitch Pine (&quot;P. rigida&quot;) and Canary Island Pine (&quot;P. canariensis&quot;). As none of these are species particularly closely related to each other, the adaptation has probably arisen independently in each, an example of convergent evolution.

==Cultivation and uses==
The wood of the &quot;Pinus leiophylla&quot; is hard, dense and strong. It is used for construction, firewood, and railroad ties. In South Africa and Queensland, Australia there are big extensions of this tree planted. It is planted commercially in Kenya, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia at high altitudes.

<doc id="545725" wikidata="Q1200561" url="?curid=545725" title="Predatory pricing">
<text>Predatory pricing is a commercial pricing strategy which involves the use of large scale undercutting to eliminate competition. This is where an industry dominant firm with sizable market power will deliberately reduce the prices of a product or service to loss-making levels to attract all consumers and create a monopoly. For a period of time, the prices are set unrealistically low to ensure competitors are unable to effectively compete with the dominant firm without making substantial loss. The aim is to force existing or potential competitors within the industry to abandon the market so that the dominant firm may establish a stronger market position and create further barriers to entry. Once competition has been driven from the market, consumers are forced into a monopolistic market where the dominant firm can safely increase prices to recoup its losses.

The critical difference between predatory pricing and other market strategies is the potential for consumer harm in the long-term. Despite initial buyer&#x27;s market created through firms&#x27; competing for consumer preference, as the price war favours the dominant firm, consumers will be forced to accept fewer options and higher prices for the same goods and services in the monopolistic market. If strategy is successful, predatory pricing can cause consumer harm and is, therefore, considered anti-competitive in many jurisdictions making the practice illegal under numerous competition laws.

==Concept==
Predatory pricing is split into a two-stage strategy.

The first stage of predatory pricing (predation) involves the dominant firm offering goods and services at below-cost rate which, in turn, leads to a reduction in the firm&#x27;s immediate short-term profits. This drop in price forces the market price for those goods or services to readjust to this lower price, putting smaller firms and industry entrants at risk of exiting the industry. The principle behind this strategy is that, unlike new entrants and current players, the dominant firm has the size and capital to sustain short-term loss in profits, thus forcing a game of survival that the dominant firm is likely to win.

The second stage is the &quot;recoupment&quot;, during which the dominant firm readjusts its product and service prices to approach monopoly prices (or a monopoly price, depending on remaining industry players and the dominant firm&#x27;s market share) to recover their losses in the long-term. This price adjustment can put consumers under pressure, as they are now forced to accept the higher price without any fair-priced competition, thus resulting in consumer harm. This is what differentiates predatory pricing from normal competitive pricing. Under EU law, the European Commission can account for recoupment as a factor when determining whether predatory pricing is abusive. This is because predatory pricing can only be considered economically effective if a firm can recover its short-term losses from pricing below Average Variable Costs (AVC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Case 62/86&quot;&gt;Case 62/86 , &quot;AKZO Chemie BV v Commission of the European Communities&quot; [1991] ECR I-03359, para 71&lt;/ref&gt; However, recoupment is not a precondition for establishing whether predatory pricing is an abuse of dominance under Article 102 TFEU. Assessing other factors, such as barriers to entry, can suffice in demonstrating how predatory pricing can lead to foreclosure of competitors from the market.

The use of predatory pricing to gain a foothold in a market in one territory while maintaining high prices in the suppliers&#x27; home market (also known as &quot;dumping&quot;) creates a risk that the loss-making product will find its way back to the home market and drive down prices there. This can result in negative effects on the home market and cause harm to domestic supplies and producers. Due to this, countries often have laws and regulations enforced to prevent dumping and other forms of predatory pricing strategies that may distort trade.

==Legal features==
1. The principal aspect of predatory pricing is that the seller in the market has a certain economic or technical strength which distinguishes it from price discrimination, where competition exists amongst both buyers and sellers.

2. The geographic market for predatory pricing is the country&#x27;s domestic market which differentiates it from &quot;dumping&quot;. Dumping refers to the practice of selling commodities in overseas markets at a lower price than within the domestic market. Though it can be determined that both concepts have similarities in terms of &quot;low-cost sales&quot; and &quot;exhaustion of competitors&quot;, numerous differences have been noted:

(1) The scopes of application of the two are different. Predatory pricing applies to domestic trade, while dumping applies to international trade.

(2) The identification standards of the two are different. Predatory pricing is based on cost, while dumping is based on the price applicable to the normal trading of similar domestic products.

(3) The laws applicable to both are different. Predatory pricing mainly falls under domestic laws, while dumping falls to international treaties or the laws of other countries.

(4) The consequences of the two are different. Legal sanctions for predatory pricing are compensatory damages or administrative penalties, while dumping involves the levying of anti-dumping duties.

3. The objective performance of predatory pricing is that a company temporarily sells goods or services below cost to eliminate competitors from a certain market and create exclusivity. The predatory pricing company can then sell goods and services at monopoly prices to compensate for the losses from initial low price sales.

4. A dominant firm&#x27;s subjective intention may be to eliminate competition to gain a monopoly advantage. Under EU law, if a dominant firm prices above AVC but below Average Total Costs (ATC), proving intention can be useful evidence for finding predatory pricing. However, the difficulty is faced when distinguishing between an intention to eliminate competitors and an intention to win the competition. Thus, the European Commission does not have to establish an undertaking&#x27;s subjective intention to prove that Article 102 applies, as abuse is an objective rather than a subjective concept.

==Implementation conditions==
1. Sacrificing short-term profits

The economic theory of predatory pricing involves a company pricing its goods and services to generate less revenue in the short term, thus, eliminating competitors and increasing market power. The theory does not explicitly state that profits must be negative in order for this to be achieved. In anti-monopoly law enforcement, determining the level of pricing that constitutes predatory pricing can be difficult in operation. The generally acceptable standard is that during a period of predatory prices, the predator&#x27;s profit will be negative where the price is lower than the initial cost. However, with this the question arises as to what kind of cost should be used as a reference. The use of a price that is lower than the cost may make certain predatory pricing practices not legally binding.

According to the theory of industrial organization, some predatory pricing practices may not necessarily lead to negative short-term profits. However, in this particular case, the company&#x27;s ability to make low-cost profits can indicate that the company is a highly efficient company compared to its competitors. This does not necessarily indicate that such instances will lead to reduced benefits in the long-term as non-entry of entrants does not necessarily reduce welfare, and entry of entrants does not necessarily improve it. Consequently, anti-monopoly law ignores this and does not result in major welfare losses.

2. The ability of incumbent company to raise prices

An important condition for predatory pricing is that, after excluding competitors, a dominant firm can raise prices to compensate for their short-term losses. To achieve this, market power can be an important factor. However, under EU law, market power is not necessary to establish predatory pricing, since other factors such as barriers to entry can indicate an abuse of a dominant position.

It is also important to note the barriers to entry impact on a dominant firm&#x27;s ability to raise the price of their goods and services. On the exclusion of these barriers, other firms could theoretically enter any market where an incumbent firm is enjoying economic profits, thereby preventing the dominant firm from sufficiently raising prices high enough to recoup the costs of lowering price.

==Theories for controlling predatory pricing==
It can be difficult to identify when normal price competition turns into anti-competitive predatory pricing. Therefore, various rules and economic tests have been established to identify predatory pricing.

===No rule===
According to Easterbrook, predatory pricing is rare and should not be considered a central concern. Introducing laws against predation, especially because it is rare, could lead to generating false positive errors, which would restrict the rule. The main point of the argument is that government intervention is dispensable, as predation is unlikely to succeed and creates a deterrent effect on its own. The deterrent effect results from selling goods and services below the costs, which causes losses without the gain in market power. In this case, the market power does not increase due to the market share holder weathering the predatory strategy. Thus, the firm punished itself by taking losses without gaining market share. As a consequence, this acts a deterrent for other firms. An additional argument against the implementation of rules is the inability of courts or competition authorities to differentiate predatory from competitive prices.

===Short-term loss rules and the Areeda-Turner test ===
In 1975, Phillip Areeda and Donald Turner developed a short-run cost-based test, widely referred to as the &#x27;Areeda-Turner rule&#x27;. The rules are based on short term focus due to the long run focus being too speculative and inefficient. The Areeda-Turner rule suggests prices at or above reasonable expected average variable costs (AVC) are presumed to be lawful, but prices below AVC are presumed to be unlawful and anti-competitive.

In EU law, the approach to testing for predatory pricing under Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) has been explained in a number of important cases.

In &quot;ECS/AKZO&quot;, the European Commission did not adopt the Areeda-Turner rule. The Court of Justice upheld this decision for the inclusion of other factors (such as proof of intention to eliminate competition) to be taken into consideration alongside a cost-based analysis. Instead, the Court in &quot;AKZO&quot; suggested that if a dominant firm sets prices below AVC, the predatory pricing is presumed to be abusively predatory due to the assumed intention to eliminate competitors rather than maximize profits. However, a strategy would not be presumed predatory were a dominant firm to set prices above AVC but below ATC unless evidence were provided to show dominant firm&#x27;s plan to eliminate competition. Additionally, if a dominant firm sets prices above ATC, the firm is most commonly not found guilty of predatory pricing, though, still may be proven anti-competitive if potential for substantial consumer harm is discovered. The &quot;AKZO&quot; test was reaffirmed in &quot;Tetra Pak II&quot;, and &quot;France Télécom&quot;.

In &quot;Post Danmark I&quot;, the Court of Justice developed upon &quot;AKZO&quot; by stating that prices above average incremental costs but below ATC would not likely be ruled abusive under Article 102 of the TFEU if there was no evidence the dominant firm deliberately intended to eliminate competition.

===Long-term cost-based rule===
Posner&#x27;s long-term cost-based rule assumes that long-run marginal costs are a more reliable test of predation than short-run costs. This is due to the predator, who prices at short-run marginal cost, having the ability to eliminate competitors that cannot afford the same losses in the short-run. To determine predation, Posner brought forth a test that substitutes the average costs from the firm&#x27;s balance sheet to establish a test that relates to the full average costs based on the company&#x27;s books. The test would include certain prerequisites, an intent element, as well as a defense. As a prerequisite, Posner requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the market was predestined for effective predatory pricing. As indicators, Posner lists, for instance, that the predator operates in various markets, whereas the prey operates in fewer markets, concentrated markets, slow entry, few fringe firms, homogenous products and numerous buyers. Posner would authorize the firm to defend due to changes in supply or demand, allowing the respondent firm to price its products at short-run marginal cost.

According to the European Commission&#x27;s &quot;Guidance on the Commission&#x27;s Enforcement Priorities in Applying Article 82 of the Treaty to Abusive Exclusionary Conduct by Dominant Undertakings&quot;, if a dominant firm does not cover its average avoidable costs or long-run average incremental costs, this implies the dominant firm is operating at a loss in the short-term to foreclose equally efficient competitors from the market. The Guidance does not bind the EU Courts, however, it is an important document that could influence future decisions.

===Rules governing price increases after predation===
William Baumol proposed a long-term rule seeking to avoid full reliance on cost-based tests to determine predatory pricing. Baumol&#x27;s rule involves requiring any price cut made in response to entry to continue for a five-year period after the exit of the entrant (i.e., if an incumbent firm cuts its price to drive out an entrant, the incumbent firm is prevented from increasing price for five years). This rule significantly diminishes the incentive of a firm to engage in predatory pricing since the predatory firm cannot reap the benefits of its anti-competitive behavior (monopoly profits) during the five-year period. Baumol&#x27;s proposed rule is not absolute, however, it does offer the predator some freedom to raise its post-exit price if the price increase is justified by demonstrable changes in the firm&#x27;s costs or market demand.

===Further strategies===

====Industry-specific rules====
Craswell and Fratrik suggest that establishing a legal standard to detect predatory pricing in the retail industry is unnecessary and should not amount to an antitrust violation. The primary reasoning was that predatory pricing typically requires strong barriers to entry to generate profits in the long run, which are absent in the retail grocery industry. When low-cost warehouse stores enter the market, supermarkets often reduce their prices to eliminate this competition or discourage them from expansion. However, Craswell and Fratrik suggest that this may not be predatory pricing, but rather incumbent firms engaging in non-predatory price cuts required for ordinary competition.

====Rule of reason test====
Section 1 of the &quot;Sherman Act Antitrust Act of 1890&quot; prohibits &quot;&#x27;every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce.&quot;″ However, Courts have adopted the rule of reason test to analyze the effects of a restraint of trade on competition. Recent case law suggests that there is a four-step rule of reason test. First, the plaintiff must demonstrate an &quot;anti-competitive effect&quot;. Second, the defendant must show a &quot;legitimate procompetitive justification&quot;. Third, the plaintiff must highlight that the restraint is not &quot;reasonably necessary&quot; to achieve the defendant&#x27;s objectives or that there are &quot;less restrictive alternatives&quot;. Fourth, the Court will balance the restraint of trade&#x27;s &quot;anti-competitive effects with its pro-competitive justifications.&quot; Failure to satisfy any of these elements will defeat the anti-trust violation claim.

====Output restriction rule====
Williamson offers the output restriction rule to restrain dominant firms from engaging in predatory pricing. The rule stipulates that upon the entry of a new firm in a market, a dominant firm cannot abuse their position by increasing their output above the pre-entry level. A prevention period of 12 to 18 months should be adequate for new entrants to establish a market identity and understand economies of scale while disincentivizing dominant firms from holding excess capacity. Williamson suggests that the output restriction rule possesses greater welfare properties than the short-run marginal cost rule or short-run average cost rule.

====Two tier approach====
Joskow and Klevorick offer a two-tier approach to identify predatory pricing. The first stage involves an analysis of the structural characteristics of the relevant market and the market power of the firm allegedly engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the market in which the behaviour occurred would be prone to predatory pricing and cause losses in economic efficiency. The second stage involves behavioural considerations which may demonstrate predation such as the dominant firm pricing below average variable cost.

The Brooke Group rule

The Brooke Group rule was established by the US Supreme Court in 1993 for the particular case involving Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation. Under this rule, to be found guilty of predatory pricing, the plaintiff was to prove the following:

# Defendant set prices to below own cost of production.
# If successful in driving competitors from the market, defendant had high probability of recouping losses through increase in prices in the long-term.
# Defendant had clear intent to engage in predatory pricing

The first element can be proven with sufficient evidence of defendant&#x27;s costs in the production of their goods and services. The second element can be proven with evidence of the defendant&#x27;s barriers to entry, market power and other evidence that would likely lead to the increase in prices in the future. The third element would require direct evidence to clearly demonstrate the defendant&#x27;s plans to manipulate the market through use of predatory pricing strategy. This may be found through capture of firm&#x27;s internal documents or plans.

If all elements can be proven with sufficient evidence for each, following the Brooke Group rule, the plaintiff may claim for predatory pricing under the US antitrust law.

==Legal aspects amongst different countries==
In many countries, there are legal restrictions upon using the predatory pricing strategy as it may be deemed anti-competitive. Although it may not be technically illegal, it can be subject to severe restrictions.

===Australia===
Predatory pricing is illegal in Australia under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (formally known as the Trade Practices Act). The Act prohibits the use of this particular commercial strategy by dominant firms with significant quantity of the market share within the industry of operation. The Act defines the strategy as a dominant firm employing the method of undercutting or underselling with the intention to force competitors to exit or prevent entry to the industry. The dominant firm can only have significant quantity of the market share in an industry if the firm is not substantially impacted or constrained by its competitors on suppliers and consumers.

In 2017, the Australian government amended the Competition and Consumer Act by introducing an &quot;effects test&quot;. This particular test determined engagement in predatory pricing if a firm were discovered to be selling goods or services at prices likely to lead to the lessening of competition in a market industry. This amendment to the Act was one of the changes included in the &quot;Harper reforms&quot; that expanded the predatory pricing definition to include the effect of below-cost prices in lessening competition regardless of firm market power. The Harper reforms were introduced to allow for smaller firms to stand ground amongst larger firms engaging in predatory behaviour and anti-competitive strategies.

In 2020, further amendments to the Act created a new threshold test to prohibit those engaging in predatory pricing and strengthen the prohibition of market power misuse. These amendments were made in response to the recommendations made during the Harper reforms. The amendments, labelled the &quot;Birdsville Amendments&quot; after Senator Barnaby Joyce, penned the idea in Section 46, to define the practice more liberally than other behavior by requiring the business to first have a &quot;substantial share of a market&quot; (rather than substantial market power). This was made in a move to further protect smaller businesses from larger players and their misuse of market power.

===Canada===
Section 50 of the &quot;Competition Act&quot;, which criminalized predatory pricing, has been repealed and replaced by sections 78 and 79, which both deal with the matters civilly.

Section 78(1)(i) of the &quot;Competition Act&quot; prohibits companies from the selling of products at unreasonably low prices designed to facilitate the effect of eliminating competition or a competitor. The Competition Bureau has established Predatory Pricing Guidelines defining what is considered unreasonably low pricing.

===United States===
Predatory pricing practices may result in antitrust claims of monopolization or attempts to monopolize. Businesses with dominant or substantial market shares are more susceptible to antitrust claims. However, as antitrust laws are ultimately intended to benefit consumers, and discounting results in at least short-term net benefit to consumers, the U.S. Supreme Court has set high hurdles to antitrust claims based on predatory pricing theory. The Court requires plaintiffs to show a likelihood that the pricing practices affect not only rivals, but also competition in the market as a whole in order to establish there is a substantial probability of success in monopolization. If there is a likelihood that market entrants will prevent the predator from recouping its investment through supra-competitive pricing, then there is no probability of success and the antitrust claim would fail. Additionally, the Court established that for prices to be predatory, they must be below the seller&#x27;s cost.

The US Department of Justice, however, argues that modern economic theory based on strategic analysis supports predatory pricing as a real problem, and claims that the courts are out of date and too skeptical.

===European Union===
Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is the relevant statutory provision under EU law for dealing with predatory pricing. According to Article 102:&quot;Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the internal market or in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the internal market in so far as it may affect trade between Member States.&quot; If Article 102 is breached by a predatory pricing practice, the European Commission may intervene as they prioritize dealing with &quot;exclusionary abuses&quot; which exclude competitors from the market.  According to the &#x27;Guidance in Applying Article 102&quot;&quot;&#x27;, the Commission normally intervene in possible predatory pricing cases if a dominant firm aims to maintain or strengthen its market power by &quot;sacrificing&quot; short-term losses to foreclose &quot;as efficient&quot; competitors, or even &quot;less efficient&quot; competitors. The &quot;as efficient competitor&quot; refers to a hypothetical competitor with the same costs as the dominant firm. The &quot;as efficient competitor&quot; test was endorsed in &quot;AKZO&quot; as the legal standard for assessing predatory pricing under Article 102.

===India===
The Competition Act, 2002 outlaws predatory pricing, treating it as an abuse of dominant position, prohibited under Section 4. Predatory pricing under the Act means the sale of goods or provision of services, at a price below cost, as may be determined by regulations, of production of the goods or provision of services, with a view to reduce competition or eliminate the competitors. A contravention of section 4 of the Act is anti-competitive per se, where there is no requirement to prove that the conduct had an anti-competitive effect on the market.

===Russian Federation===
Article 10 of the Federal Law No.135-FZ &#x27;On the Protection of Competition&#x27; (FLPC) (Russian: &quot;ст. 10, Федерального закона от 26.07.2006 N 135-ФЗ &quot;О защите конкуренции&quot;&quot;) deals with unilateral conduct of economic entities by prohibiting abuse of dominant position. The definition of such abuse, as stated in the article, includes &quot;the setting of an unjustified high or unjustified low price of a financial service by a financial entity&quot;.

All the matters connected with the abuse of the market power are handled by the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russian Federation (FAS). The FAS investigates all alleged violations of the antimonopoly legislation and determines whether a dominant position has been exploited by one of the market participants.

===United Kingdom===
Section 18(1) of the Competition Act 1998 prohibits the abuse of a dominant position by &quot;one or more undertakings... if it may affect trade within the United Kingdom.&quot; This is commonly known as the &quot;Chapter II prohibition&quot;. The section is very similar to article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union governing the anti-monopoly laws within the EU jurisdiction, with the exception of parts regarding the effect on trade within the UK.

===Germany===
Sections 19 and 20 of the Act against Restraints of Competition (ARC) prohibit the abuse of a dominant position. Section 19 lists in more detail the entities with market power addressed by the Act. Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also applies, although it has some differences with the ARC.

Compliance with the Act is enforced by the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) (German: &quot;Bundeskartellamt&quot;). With the FCO as the higher federal authority, there also exists state cartels in each of the federal states in Germany. The FCO is in the area of responsibility of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (German: &quot;Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie&quot;).

=== Austria===
The European competition law art. 82 EC and § 5 KartG 2005 prohibit a market dominant enterprise, as well as a collective of several dominant enterprises, from intentionally suppressing a competitor or increasing their respective market share by using methods other than those of legal competitive performance. According to the law, predatory pricing is considered a violation if a market-dominant enterprise controls the local market by offering its goods and services at prices below AVC. However, if prices are below ATC, but above AVC, predattory pricing may not be considered a law violation. Furthermore, if market abuse is directed against competitors, and not against suppliers and clients, Austrian law provides provisions under § 1UWG (in connection with §5 para. 1 KartG 2005, if there is a competitive relationship). Additionally, according to §1UWG, predatory pricing can be unconscionable if intended to harm competitors—even without the dominant company incurring losses. Moreover, predatory pricing can be unconscionable according to §1UWG if the dominant firm expels enough competitors from the market to gain enough market share to dictate prices.

===Denmark===
According to §6, sec. 1, of the Competition Act (CA), entering into anti-competitive agreements is prohibited. The CA §6 corresponds to art. 81, sec. 1 of the EC- Treaty and prohibits predatory pricing.

===Greece===
Generally, Art. 1(1) of the antitrust law (I. 703/1977) prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices that strive to prevent, restrict, or distort competition in the Greek market. Particularly art. 2(1) of I 703/77 prohibits predatory pricing within Greece.

===Sweden===
Under Art. 101 TFEU and Section 6 of the Swedish Competition Act (KL), agreements between undertakings with objectives to effect prevention, distortion or restriction of competition are strictly prohibited in Sweden. Price-fixing agreements (where competitors concur to set prices at an agreed level) between competitors are considered &quot;hardcore&quot; restriction of competition and are prohibited. This does not include other types of price agreements between competitors. These agreements may, therefore, be assessed under rule of reason and can be found permissible if no significant anti-competitive effects are identified.

== Criticism ==
According to economist Thomas DiLorenzo, true predatory pricing is a rare phenomenon and an irrational practice with laws designed to inhibit competition. According to the European Commission, this is because predatory pricing can cause firms to make a loss due to increased output. This stance was taken by the US Supreme Court in the 1993 case &quot;Brooke Group v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco.&quot; The Federal Trade Commission has not successfully prosecuted any company for predatory pricing since.

Thomas Sowell explains one reason why predatory pricing may not be completely effective:
:&quot;Obviously, predatory pricing pays off only if the surviving predator can then raise prices enough to recover the previous losses, making enough extra profit thereafter to justify the risks. These risks are not small.&quot;
:&quot;However, even the demise of a competitor does not leave the survivor home free. Bankruptcy does not by itself destroy the fallen competitor&#x27;s physical plant or the people whose skills made it a viable business. Both may be available-perhaps at distress prices-to others who can spring up to take the defunct firm&#x27;s place.&quot;
:&quot;The Washington Post went bankrupt in 1933, though not because of predatory pricing. But neither its physical plant, its people, or its name disappeared into thin air. Instead, publisher Eugene Meyer acquired all three-at a fraction of what he had bid unsuccessfully for the same newspaper just four years earlier. In the course of time, the Post became the biggest newspaper in Washington.&quot;

Critics of laws against predatory pricing may support their case empirically by arguing that there has been no instance where such a practice has actually led to a monopoly. Conversely, they argue that there is much evidence that predatory pricing has failed miserably. For example, Herbert Dow not only found a cheaper way to produce bromine but also defeated a predatory pricing attempt by the government-supported German cartel Bromkonvention, who objected to his selling in Germany at a lower price. Bromkonvention retaliated by flooding the US market with below-cost bromine, at an even lower price than Dow&#x27;s. However, Dow simply instructed his agents to buy up at the very low price and then sell it back in Germany at a price still lower than Bromkonvention&#x27;s. In the end, the cartel could not keep up with selling below cost and had to surrender in the price war. This was used as evidence that the free market is a better way to stop predatory pricing than regulations such as anti-trust laws.

In another example of a successful defense against predatory pricing, a price war emerged between the New York Central Railroad (NYCR) and the Erie Railroad. At one point, NYCR charged only a dollar per car for the transport of cattle. While the cattle cars quickly filled up, management were dismayed to find that Erie Railroad had also invested in the cattle-haulage business, making Erie a buyer of cattle transport, and thus profiting from NYCR&#x27;s losses.

Sowell argues:
:&quot;It is a commentary on the development of antitrust law that the accused must defend himself, not against actual evidence of wrongdoing, but against a theory which predicts wrongdoing in the future. It is the civil equivalent of &quot;preventive detention&quot; in criminal cases—punishment without proof.&quot;

==Support==
An article written by heterodox economist Thomas DiLorenzo and published by the libertarian Cato Institute suggests that while a company might be able to successfully price other firms out of the market, there is no evidence to support the theory that the virtual monopoly could then raise prices. This would be due to other emerging firms rapidly entering the market to compete. Such entrances demand substantial capital investments, which would not be repaid for a substantial period of time due to sharp price decreases, provoked by resumption of competition. According to the Chicago School of Thought advocated by Robert Bork, predatory pricing is not always anti-competitive even if it ends a successful strategy. The Court in &quot;Post Danmark&quot; agreed predatory pricing does not always harm competition because competing &quot;on the merits&quot; to exclude less-efficient competitors can benefit consumers by providing lower prices, improved quality and choice of products and services.

The DG Competition&#x27;s &#x27;Discussion Paper&#x27; states predatory pricing can sometimes be justified as a rational strategy. This is why dominant firms can rebut presumptions of predatory pricing, despite prices falling below the &quot;relevant cost benchmark&quot;. For example, dominant undertaking could argue that changing market conditions have caused reduced demand but increased capacity, and therefore below-cost pricing was necessary in the short-term to sell off fresh produce. Although this defense is not commonly accepted due to predatory pricing rarely being the most efficient option, it is still possible for predatory pricing to be considered a rational strategy.

==Examples of alleged predatory pricing==
*In &quot;AKZO v Commission&quot;, AKZO were fined €10 million for abusing its dominant position in the organic peroxides market by reducing its prices to loss-making levels, preventing English firm &#x27;ECS&#x27; from competing on the polymer market.
*In &quot;Tetra Pak v Commission&quot;, Tetra Pak were fined €75 million for abusing its dominant position by reducing prices of non-asceptic cartons.
*In &quot;Wanadoo Interactive&quot;, a €10.35 million fine was imposed on France Télécom&#x27;s subsidiary, Wanadoo Interactive. Based on &quot;AKZO&quot;, high-speed residential broadband internet services were priced at levels below AVC until August 2001, and later at around AVC but below ATC.
* In &quot;ACCC v Cabcharge Australia&quot; Ltd, Cabcharge were fined $3 million for engaging in predatory pricing conduct by supplying taxi meters that were below cost and fare schedule updates at no charge. This breached section 46(1) of the &quot;Trade Practices Act&quot; 1974. 
* In &quot;MCX v NSE&quot;, the NSE abused its dominant position in the currency derivatives segment by waiving transaction and admission fees, thus preventing MCX from competing in the market. This breached section 4 of the &quot;Competition Act&quot;, 2002 and amounted to a Rs 55.5 crore penalty. 
*According to an AP article a law in Minnesota forced Walmart to increase its price for a one-month supply of the prescription birth control pill Tri-Sprintec from $9.00 to $26.88.
*According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article the German government ordered Walmart to increase its prices.
*According to an &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; article, the French government ordered amazon.com to stop offering free shipping to its customers because it violated French predatory pricing laws. After Amazon refused to obey the order, the government proceeded to fine them €1,000 per day. Amazon continued to pay the fines instead of ending its policy of offering free shipping. After a law was created explicitly banning free shipping, Amazon started charging one cent for delivery. 
*In a period known as Darlington Bus War in Darlington, England, Stagecoach Group offered free bus rides to put the rival Darlington Corporation Transport out of business.
*Some have accused Amazon of using predatory pricing to undercut competitors such as Quidsi before offering to buy them out at low cost once their financial future had become bleak.
*Sir Freddie Laker, founder of Laker Airways, sued IATA member airlines British Airways, BCal, Pan Am, TWA, Lufthansa, Air France, Swissair, KLM, SAS, Sabena, Alitalia and UTA for conspiracy to put his airline out of business by predatory pricing. They settled out of court for US$50 million, with British Airways later agreeing to contribute a further $35 million. British Airways also reached a separate out-of-court agreement with Sir Freddie personally for £8 million.

<text>Russell Gregoire MacLellan (born January 16, 1940) is a Canadian politician who served as the 24th premier of Nova Scotia from 1997 to 1999.

==Federal politics==
He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1979 federal election for the riding of Cape Breton—The Sydneys and sat as a Liberal MP until 1997.

==Provincial politics==
In 1997, he became leader of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party and premier of the province after John Savage was forced to resign due to discontent within his party and sagging polls. MacLellan tried to revive the Liberal government&#x27;s fortunes; he narrowly won a minority government in the 1998 election, but his government was defeated in a confidence vote in 1999 and then defeated in the resulting 1999 election.

On January 26, 2000, MacLellan announced he would step down as Liberal leader on June 30. He continued to sit as an MLA until resigning in October 2000.

==After politics==
Following his resignation, MacLellan returned to practising law, working for the Halifax-based law firm, Merrick Holm.

<text>is a flatland castle in Kyoto, Japan. The castle consists of two concentric rings (Kuruwa) of fortifications, the Ninomaru Palace, the ruins of the Honmaru Palace, various support buildings and several gardens. The surface area of the castle is , of which is occupied by buildings.

It is one of the seventeen Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto which have been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.

== History ==

In 1601, Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the Tokugawa shogunate, ordered all the feudal lords in western Japan to contribute to the construction of Nijō Castle, which was completed during the reign of his grandson Tokugawa Iemitsu in 1626. While the castle was being built, a portion of land from the partially abandoned Shinsenen Garden (originally part of the imperial palace and located south) was absorbed, and its abundant water was used in the castle gardens and ponds. Parts of Fushimi Castle, such as the main tower and the &quot;karamon&quot;, were moved here in 1625–26. Nijo Castle was built as the Kyoto residence of the Tokugawa &quot;shōguns&quot;. The Tokugawa shogunate used Edo as the capital city, but Kyoto continued to be the home of the Imperial Court. Kyoto Imperial Palace is located north-east of Nijō Castle.

The central keep, or &quot;tenshu&quot;, was struck by lightning and burned to the ground in 1750. In 1788, the Inner Ward was destroyed by a citywide fire. The site remained empty until it was replaced by a prince&#x27;s residence transferred from the Kyoto Imperial Palace in 1893.

In 1867, the Ninomaru Palace, in the Outer Ward, was the stage for the declaration by Tokugawa Yoshinobu, returning the authority to the Imperial Court (大政奉還). In 1868 the Imperial Cabinet was installed in the castle. The palace became imperial property and was declared a detached palace. During this time, the Tokugawa hollyhock crest was removed wherever possible and replaced with the imperial chrysanthemum.

In 1939, the palace was donated to the city of Kyoto and opened to the public the following year. In the 21st century, typhoons have periodically caused sections of plaster to peel off the walls after exposure to rain and wind.

It is generally believed that the &quot;karamon&quot; gate of Toyokuni shrine was originally built for Hideyoshi&#x27;s Fushimi castle in 1598. When the castle was dismantled in 1623, the gate was first moved to Nijō castle, and then to the Konchi-in in Nanzen-ji. It was finally relocated to Toyokuni shrine in 1876 after the Meiji Restoration.

== Fortifications ==

Nijō Castle has two concentric rings of fortifications, each consisting of a wall and a wide moat. The outer wall has three gates, while the inner wall has two. In the southwest corner of the inner wall, there are foundations of a five-story keep, destroyed by a fire in 1750. The inner walls surround the Inner Ward, which contain &quot;Honmaru&quot; (&quot;Inner Ward&quot;) Palace with its garden. &quot;Ninomaru&quot; (&quot;Second Ward&quot;) Palace, the kitchens, guard house and several gardens are located in the Outer Ward, between the two main rings of fortifications.

== Ninomaru Palace ==


The consists of six connected separate main buildings and is built almost entirely of Hinoki cypress. The decoration includes lavish quantities of gold leaf and elaborate wood carvings, intended to impress visitors with the power and wealth of the &quot;shōguns&quot;. The sliding doors and walls of each room are decorated with wall paintings by artists of the Kanō school. The six main buildings have National Treasure Status, and other buildings in the palace complex have Important Cultural Property status. 

The castle is an excellent example of social control manifested in architectural space. Low-ranking visitors were received in the outer regions of the Ninomaru, whereas high-ranking visitors were shown the more subtle inner chambers. Rather than attempt to conceal the entrances to the rooms for bodyguards (as was done in many castles), the Tokugawas chose to display them prominently. Thus, the construction lent itself to expressing intimidation and power to Edo-period visitors.

The building houses several different reception chambers, offices and the living quarters of the &quot;shōgun&quot;, where only female attendants were allowed. One of the most striking features of the Ninomaru Palace are the &quot;nightingale floors&quot; (&quot;uguisubari&quot;) in the corridors that make a chirping sound when walked upon. These are often incorrectly described as a feature to alert the presence of intruders, but it is actually just caused by clamps moving against nails in the wooden beams that support the floor. However, the design of the palace buildings do contain defensive features; for example, some of the rooms in the castle also contained special doors where the shogun&#x27;s bodyguard could sneak out to protect him.

The room sequence starting at the entrance is:
* Yanagi-no-ma (Willow Room), 
* Wakamatsu-no-ma (Young Pine Room)
* Tozamurai-no-ma (Retainers&#x27; Room) 
* Shikidai-no-ma (Reception Room) 
* Rōchu-no-ma (Ministers&#x27; Offices)
* Chokushi-no-ma (Imperial Messenger&#x27;s Room)

The Ōhiroma (Great Hall) is the central core of the Ninomaru Palace and consists of four chambers:
* Ichi-no-ma (First Grand Chamber)
* Ni-no-ma (Second Grand Chamber) 
* San-no-ma (Third Grand Chamber) 
* Yon-no-ma (Fourth Grand Chamber)

as well as the Musha-kakushi-no-ma (Bodyguards&#x27; Chamber) and the Sotetsu-no-ma (Japanese fern-palm chamber).

The rear sections are the Kuroshoin (Inner Audience Chamber) and Shiroshoin (&quot;shōgun&quot;″s living quarters). The main access to the Ninomaru is through the &quot;karamon&quot;, a court and the &quot;mi-kurumayose&quot; or &quot;honourable carriages approach&quot;.

== Honmaru Palace ==

 has a surface area of . The complex has four parts: living quarters, reception and entertainment rooms, entrance halls and kitchen area. The different areas are connected by corridors and courtyards. The architectural style is late Edo period. The palace displays paintings by several famous masters, such as .

Honmaru Palace was originally similar to Ninomaru Palace. The original structures were replaced by the present structures between 1893 and 1894, by moving one part of the former Katsura Palace within the Kyoto Imperial Enclosure (Kyoto Gyoen, the enclosure surrounding the Kyoto Imperial Palace) to the inner ward of Nijō Castle, as part of the systematic clearing of the disused residences and palaces in the Imperial Enclosure after the Imperial Court moved to Tokyo in 1869. In its original location, the palace had 55 buildings, but only a small part was relocated. In 1928 the enthronement banquet of Emperor Hirohito was held here.

== Gardens ==
The castle area has several gardens and groves of cherry and Japanese plum trees. The Ninomaru garden was designed by the landscape architect and tea master Kobori Enshū. It is located between the two main rings of fortifications, next to the palace of the same name. The garden has a large pond with three islands and features numerous carefully placed stones and topiary pine trees.

The Seiryū-en garden is the most recent part of Nijō Castle. It was constructed in 1965 in the northern part of the complex, as a facility for the reception of official guests of Kyoto and as a venue for cultural events. Seiryū-en has two tea houses and more than 1,000 carefully arranged stones.

<doc id="545745" wikidata="Q535733" url="?curid=545745" title="Paul Davies">
<text>Paul Charles William Davies (born 22 April 1946) is an English physicist, writer and broadcaster, a professor in Arizona State University and director of BEYOND: Center for Fundamental Concepts in Science. He is affiliated with the Institute for Quantum Studies in Chapman University in California. He previously held academic appointments in the University of Cambridge, University College London, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, University of Adelaide and Macquarie University. His research interests are in the fields of cosmology, quantum field theory, and astrobiology.
In 2005, he took up the chair of the SETI: Post-Detection Science and Technology Taskgroup of the International Academy of Astronautics. Davies serves on the Advisory Council of METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence).

==Education==
Born on 22 April 1946, Davies was brought up in Finchley, London. He attended Woodhouse Grammar School and studied physics at University College London, gaining a Bachelor of Science degree with first-class honours in 1967.

In 1970, he completed his PhD under the supervision of Michael J. Seaton and Sigurd Zienau at University College London. He carried out postdoctoral research under Fred Hoyle in the University of Cambridge.

==Scientific research==
Davies&#x27; research interests are theoretical physics, cosmology and astrobiology; his research has been mainly in the area of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. His notable contributions are the so-called Fulling–Davies–Unruh effect, according to which an observer accelerating through empty space will be subject to a bath of induced thermal radiation, and the Bunch–Davies vacuum state, often used as the basis for explaining the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background left over from the Big Bang. A paper co-authored with Stephen Fulling and William Unruh was the first to suggest that black holes evaporating via the Hawking effect lose mass as a result of a flux of negative energy streaming into the hole from the surrounding space. Davies has had a longstanding association with the problem of time&#x27;s arrow, and has also identified the mystery of &#x27;dark energy&#x27; as one of the most important issues facing fundamental science. Davies was also an early proponent of the theory that life on Earth may have come from Mars cocooned in rocks ejected by asteroid and comet impacts. He is also a propagator of scientific research and technology development in order to prevent future comet impacts threatening the development or existence of humankind. He proposed that a one-way trip to Mars could be a viable option in the future. During his time in Australia he helped establish the Australian Centre for Astrobiology.

Davies was a co-author with Felisa Wolfe-Simon on the 2011 &quot;Science&quot; article &quot;A Bacterium That Can Grow by Using Arsenic Instead of Phosphorus&quot;. Reports refuting the most significant aspects of the original results were published in the same journal in 2012. Following the publication of the articles challenging the conclusions of the original &quot;Science&quot; article first describing GFAJ-1, the website Retraction Watch argued that the original article should be retracted because of misrepresentation of critical data.

Davies is an outreach investigator at Arizona State University&#x27;s Center for Convergence of Physical Science and Cancer Biology. This is part of a program set up by the National Institutes of Health&#x27;s National Cancer Institute to involve physicists in cancer research which has set up a network of 12 Physical Sciences-Oncology Centers.

==Awards==
Davies received the Templeton Prize in 1995. Davies&#x27; talent as a communicator of science has been recognized in Australia by an Advance Australia Award and two Eureka Prizes, and in the UK by the 2001 Kelvin Medal and Prize by the Institute of Physics, and the 2002 Faraday Prize by The Royal Society. Davies was made a member of the Order of Australia in the 2007 Queen&#x27;s birthday honours list. The minor planet 6870 Pauldavies is named after him.

==Media work==
Davies writes and comments on scientific and philosophical issues. He made a documentary series for BBC Radio 3, and two Australian television series, &quot;The Big Questions&quot; and &quot;More Big Questions&quot;. His BBC documentary &quot;The Cradle of Life&quot; featured the subject of his Faraday Prize lecture. He writes regularly for newspapers and magazines worldwide. He has been guest on numerous radio and television programmes including the children&#x27;s podcast programme &quot;Ask A Biologist&quot;.

A 2007 opinion piece &quot;Taking Science on Faith&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, generated controversy over its exploration of the role of faith in scientific inquiry. Davies argued that the faith scientists have in the immutability of physical laws has origins in Christian theology, and that the claim that science is &quot;free of faith&quot; is &quot;manifestly bogus.&quot; The Edge Foundation presented a criticism of Davies&#x27; article written by Jerry Coyne, Nathan Myhrvold, Lawrence Krauss, Scott Atran, Sean Carroll, Jeremy Bernstein, PZ Myers, Lee Smolin, John Horgan, Alan Sokal and a response by Davies beginning &quot;I was dismayed at how many of my detractors completely misunderstood what I had written. Indeed, their responses bore the hallmarks of a superficial knee-jerk reaction to the sight of the words &#x27;science&#x27; and &#x27;faith&#x27; juxtaposed.&quot; While atheists Richard Dawkins and Victor J. Stenger have criticised Davies&#x27; public stance on science and religion, other commentators, including the John Templeton Foundation, have praised his work.

Davies wrote an article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; describing the background to the December 2010 arsenic bacteria press conference and stating that he supported the finding of Felisa Wolfe-Simon that arsenic can replace phosphorus because &quot;I had the advantage of being unencumbered by knowledge. I dropped chemistry at the age of 16, and all I knew about arsenic came from Agatha Christie novels.&quot; He also made the statement, &quot;Well, I would be astonished if this was the only arsenic-based organism on Earth and Felisa just happened to scrape it up from the bottom of Mono Lake on the first try, It&#x27;s quite clear that it is the tip of an iceberg. I think it&#x27;s a window into a whole new world of microbiology. And as a matter of fact, she already has 20 or so candidate other organisms that we&#x27;re very anxious to take a look at. I think we&#x27;re going to see a whole new domain of life here.&quot; It was later independently demonstrated that the organism&#x27;s DNA contained no arsenic at all. Concerns have been raised about his responsibility as one of Wolfe-Simon&#x27;s co-authors.

<doc id="545748" wikidata="Q5101211" url="?curid=545748" title="Chino Hills State Park">
<text>Chino Hills State Park is a state park of California, in the United States. It is located in the Chino Hills, foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains. It is a critical link in the Chino–Puente Hills wildlife corridor, and a major botanical habitat reserve for resident and migrating wildlife.

Visitors can walk, horseback ride, or mountain bike on trails through valleys and along ridge tops through woodlands, sage scrub and grasslands. of trails and fire roads also offer opportunities for viewing wildlife and native plants. Facilities consist of a picnic area, camping sites, equestrian staging area and corrals, a historic barn, water and restrooms. Most of the trails are multiple mode use. A few trails are designated for hiking only for safety or habitat protection.

==Geography==
Chino Hills Park&#x27;s encompass stands of oaks, sycamores and rolling, grassy hills that stretch nearly , from the Santa Ana Mountains to the Whittier Hills encompassing the Puente Hills. Chino Hills is vitally important as a refuge to many species of California native plants, and as a link between natural habitat areas essential to the survival of many animal species. The park is located near the intersection of Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties.

The park is located northwest of Corona, and lies almost entirely in the city of Chino Hills in the southwest corner of San Bernardino County. Small parts of it spill over into Yorba Linda in northeastern Orange County, and into extreme western Riverside County, near Corona. The park has four main entrances with many other auxiliary entrances scattered throughout. The primary entrances are located in Chino Hills, Corona, Yorba Linda, and Brea. The Chino Hills entrance (also known as the north entrance) is located off of Sapphire road in northern Chino Hills. The Yorba Linda entrance is located off of Rim Crest drive in Yorba Linda. The Corona entrance is an offshoot from the Green River golf course in western Corona. The Brea entrance, also known as the Discovery Center, is located off of Carbon Canyon road in Eastern Brea, California.

==Flora==
The Chino Hills are in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion of the California Floristic Province. The native plants here are in the chaparral and oak woodland plant communities, with remnant stands of native grasses of California. The predominant native trees are coast live oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;), California black walnut (&quot;Juglans californica&quot;), and California sycamore (&quot;Platanus racemosa&quot;).

==History==

Over the centuries, many people have made use of the open spaces and plentiful water, plant and animal resources of the Chino Hills. Prior to European contact, the Tongva-Gabrieliño Indians, who lived in settlements along the Santa Ana River basin for 8,000 years, set up temporary camps in the hills for gathering acorns, elderberries, walnuts and other seeds.

After the Spanish founded Mission San Gabriel in 1771, the Chino Hills were used extensively for grazing by mission cattle. During the Mexican Republic era, the hills were used as spillover grazing from such surrounding Mexican ranchos as Santa Ana del Chino and La Sierra Yorba. The United States then conquered the territory in 1848 following the Mexican-American War. After this conquest, the land was still used primarily for grazing.

Private land acquisition began in the 1870s and continued into the 1890s. In 1848, the Rolling M Ranch was established and the land leased to nearby landowners for cattle grazing. Some late nineteenth and early twentieth century oil exploration and mining activity also took place in the northwestern section of what is now the park. A ranch house, barn, and several windmills and watering troughs serve as reminders of the cattle ranching days.

===Park founding===
In 1977 the California legislature passed a resolution directing California State Parks to conduct a study on acquiring Chino Hills land for park purposes. A local citizen group, Hills for Everyone, worked closely with California State Parks and the legislature to create the park with an initial acquisition of . In 1984, the State Park and Recreation Commission officially declared the area a unit of the State Park System. Since that date, Chino Hills State Park has been expanded by numerous land acquisitions from various private landowners. Current documentation gives the park an area of and an establishment date of 1981.

<doc id="545753" wikidata="Q738600" url="?curid=545753" title="Magical Negro">
<text>The Magical Negrois a trope in American cinema, television, and literature. In the cinema of the United States, the Magical Negro is a supporting stock character who comes to the aid of the (usually white) protagonists in a film. Magical Negro characters, often possessing special insight or mystical powers, have long been a tradition in American fiction. The old-fashioned word &quot;Negro&quot; is used to imply that a &quot;magical black character&quot; who devotes himself to selflessly helping whites is a throwback to racist stereotypes such as the &quot;Sambo&quot; or &quot;noble savage&quot;.

The term was popularized in 2001 by film director Spike Lee during a lecture tour of college campuses, in which he expressed his dismay that Hollywood continued to employ this premise. He specially noted the films &quot;The Green Mile&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot;, which featured &quot;super-duper magical Negro&quot; characters.

==Usage==

=== Fiction and film ===

The Magical Negro is a trope in cinema, television, and literature: the character is typically, but not always, &quot;in some way outwardly or inwardly disabled, either by discrimination, disability or social constraint&quot;. The Negro is often a janitor or prisoner. The character often has no past but simply appears one day to help the white protagonist. They usually have some sort of magical power, &quot;rather vaguely defined but not the sort of thing one typically encounters.&quot; The character is patient and wise, often dispensing various words of wisdom, and is &quot;closer to the earth&quot;. The character will also do almost anything, including sacrificing themselves to save the white protagonist, as exemplified in &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;, in which Sidney Poitier plays the prototypical Magical Negro. 

Film critic Matt Zoller Seitz stated that the trope &quot;takes a subject that some white folks find unpleasant or even troubling to ponder (imagining that resentful black people&#x27;s status in a country that, 50 years after the start of the modern civil rights struggle, is still run by, and mostly for, whites) and turns it into a source of gentle reassurance&quot;. Film reviewer Audrey Colombe argues that the trope has been perpetuated by the overwhelmingly White blockbuster film industry. Film director and writer Spike Lee said in 2001 that the White-dominated film industry is &quot;still doing the same old thing ... recycling the noble savage and the happy slave&quot;.

Racism historians Francisco Bethencourt and John Beusterien trace the trope to late fifteenth century and early sixteenth century Spanish &quot;comedias de negros&quot; and their depiction of black &quot;savior soldiers,&quot; who reinforce the stereotype of the supposed greater physical strength of Africans. These include &quot;El prodigio de Etiopía&quot; and &quot;El negro del mejor amo&quot; by Lope de Vega and &quot;El valiente negro en Flandes&quot; by Andrés de Claramonte.

Christopher John Farley, referring to the magical Negro as &quot;Magical African American Friends&quot; (MAAFs), says they are rooted in screenwriters’ ignorance of African Americans:
MAAFs exist because most Hollywood screenwriters don&#x27;t know much about black people other than what they hear on records by white hip-hop star Eminem. So instead of getting life histories or love interests, black characters get magical powers.

The Magical Negro stereotype serves as a plot device to help the white protagonist get out of trouble, typically through helping the white character recognize his own faults and overcome them and teaching him to be a better person. Although the character may have magical powers, the &quot;magic is ostensibly directed toward helping and enlightening a white male character&quot;. An article in a 2009 edition of the journal &quot;Social Problems&quot; stated the Magical Negro was an expression of racial profiling within the United States:
These powers are used to save and transform disheveled, uncultured, lost, or broken whites (almost exclusively white men) into competent, successful, and content people within the context of the American myth of redemption and salvation. It is this feature of the Magical Negro that some people find most troubling. Although from a certain perspective the character may seem to be showing blacks in a positive light, the character is still ultimately subordinate to whites. He or she is also regarded as an exception, allowing white America to like individual black people but not black culture.

In 2001, Spike Lee used the term in a series of talks on college campuses to criticize the stereotypical, unreal roles created for black men in films that were recent at that time, naming &quot;The Family Man&quot; (2000), &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; (1998), &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; (2000), and &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999) as examples. Talking about the time and place in which Bagger Vance is set, he said:
: &quot;Blacks are getting lynched left and right, and [Bagger Vance is] more concerned about improving Matt Damon&#x27;s golf swing! ... I gotta sit down; I get mad just thinking about it. They&#x27;re still doing the same old thing ... recycling the noble savage and the happy slave.&quot; He went on to discuss his desire to create films showing black people doing all kinds of things.

In a book published in 2004, writer Krin Gabbard claimed that the Oda Mae Brown character in the 1990 movie &quot;Ghost&quot;, played by Whoopi Goldberg, was an example of a Magical Negress.

In 2012, writer Kia Miakka Natisse discussed actor Morgan Freeman playing parts conforming to the Magical Negro form, such as &quot;a doctor who creates a prosthetic tail for a dolphin (in &quot;Dolphin Tale&quot;), and an ailing CIA mentor (in &quot;Red&quot;) – in both roles he reprises the Magical Negro type, coming to save the day for his imperiled white counterparts. One could argue his gadget guru in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; fits under that same umbrella.&quot;

Chris Rock made references to the trope on his show &quot;The Chris Rock Show&quot;, including one critical of &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot;, entitled &quot;Migger, the Magic Nigger&quot;. Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, of &quot;MADtv&quot; and &quot;Key and Peele&quot; fame, followed suit in both shows with their own critical Magical Negro sketches.

The 2019 indie film &quot;Cold Brook,&quot; written and directed by William Fichtner, included a Magical Negro named Gil Le Doux, played by Harold Perrineau. The role was a century-old trapped ghost who was saved by two middle-aged men experiencing midlife crises.

The 2024 film &quot;The American Society of Magical Negroes&quot; critiques and satirizes the magical negro trope by portraying a secret society of African-Americans who make it their job to keep White people comfortable. The film was not well-received, with critiques of it being too safe to make any commentary.

===Barack Obama===
In March 2007, American critic David Ehrenstein used the title &quot;Obama the &#x27;Magic Negro&#x27;&quot; for an editorial he wrote for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, in which he described Barack Obama&#x27;s image in white American culture:
Discussing the Ehrenstein editorial at length, Rush Limbaugh at one point sang the words, &quot;Barack the magic negro&quot; to the tune of song &quot;Puff, the Magic Dragon&quot;. Shortly after that Paul Shanklin recorded a song about Barack the Magic Negro set to that same tune, which Limbaugh played numerous times throughout the 2008 presidential election season. In Christmas 2008, Chip Saltsman, a Republican politician and chair of the Tennessee Republican Party, sent a 41-track CD containing the song to members of the Republican National Committee during the Republican National Committee chairmanship election. Saltsman&#x27;s campaign imploded as a result of the controversy caused by the CD, and he withdrew from the race.

In May 2015, theater and cultural critic Frank Rich, looking back at the coincidence of the 2015 Baltimore protests with the annual White House Correspondents&#x27; dinner in Washington, DC, wrote: &quot;What made this particular instance poignant was the presence in the ballroom of our first African-American president, the Magic Negro who was somehow expected to relieve a nation founded and built on slavery from the toxic burdens of centuries of history.&quot;

<text>The Historical Records Survey (HRS) was a project of the Works Progress Administration New Deal program in the United States. Originally part of the Federal Writers&#x27; Project, it was devoted to surveying and indexing historically significant records in state, county and local archives. The official mission statement was the &quot;discovery, preservation, and listing of basic materials for research in the history of the United States&quot;. The creation of the Historical Records Survey was one of the signal events &quot;in what Solon Buck called the &#x27;archival awakening&#x27; of the 1930s&quot;.

==Organization==

Organized on November 15, 1935 under the direction of Luther H. Evans, the Survey began life under the Federal Writers&#x27; Project and in October 1936, became an independent section of Federal Project Number One and the Works Progress Administration&#x27;s Women&#x27;s and Professional Division. The project was granted a budget of twice over: one budget was for a survey of federal records located outside of Washington, D.C., and another budget in the same amount was for a survey of state and local historical records.

In 1939, with more artistic federal programs under attack from Congress, partly because they employed suspected Communists, the less controversial HRS was moved to the Work Projects Administration Research and Records Program, Professional and Service Division. Over the course of the program, HRS employed upwards of 10,000 American workers. Base pay for a month&#x27;s work was between $50 and $60.

In 1939 the federal government handed off the program&#x27;s activities to willing state governments; each state had its own supervisor co-ordinating the Survey&#x27;s activities.

The HRC, headquartered in Washington, D.C., was organized into subdivisions (regional, state, district) and much of the work was done at the behest of the National Archives and Records Administration or state archive agencies. The HRS sometimes cooperated with the Daughters of the American Revolution and other volunteer groups with an interest in local history and genealogy. As noted in Evans&#x27; obituary in &quot;American Archivist&quot;, &quot;Survey workers were active in every county of every state, in every state capitol, and in thousands of town halls.&quot;
The HRS was generally considered the most efficient and inexpensive of the Federal One projects. However, because of the program&#x27;s short lifespan, many of the indexes were not published and remain in only piecemeal form in local and state record repositories.

Evans&#x27; deputy Sargent B. Child became HRS director in March 1940 after Evans took a job with the Library of Congress&#x27; Legislative Services Division. Child served until 1942. In 1942, the HRS was reorganized under the Works Progress Administration Service Division War Service Section, which later discontinued &quot;fact-finding, survey, records and clerical services&quot; as superfluous to the war effort. Pursuant to a Presidential letter of December 4, 1942, the HRS program was shut down February 1, 1943.

==Achievements==

According to regional historian Clifton Dale Foster, &quot;In most states, several diverse projects were operating simultaneously. Its largest project was the Survey of County Records, which located, identified, arranged, and described massive amounts of public records found in county archives. The result was the publication of some 628 volumes of inventories. Other programs of major importance included the Survey of Federal Archives, directed by Philip M. Hamer; the Survey of Church Records; and the American Imprints Inventory.&quot;

Other accomplishments included the Soundex indexes for several of the states for several of the turn-of-the-century U.S. Censuses (1880, 1900, 1910, 1920), indexes of vital statistics, book indexes, bibliographies, lists of newspapers, cemetery indexes and newspaper indexes, the &quot;Atlas of Congressional Roll Calls Project&quot;, &quot;a continuation of Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Messages and Papers of the Presidents&quot;&quot;, a historical index of American musicians, surveys of portraits in public buildings, maritime records, and a necessary survey of the federal Archives—NARA itself had been established only in 1934.

As an example, the HRS documentation for Massachusetts included: &quot;forty-five bundles of town inventories; ten bundles of county inventories; fourteen bundles relating to church records; four bundles of material gathered for a &#x27;Guide to Manuscripts Relating to the Negro in Massachusetts&#x27;; ten bundles related to portraits, engravings, silhouettes; and more besides&quot;.

Each state operated independently and many produced interesting regional miscellany. The achievements of the extensive Wisconsin records survey, for one, included the usual indices as well as further: &quot;a guide to the newspapers of one county, an index of governor&#x27;s messages, a history of Galesville University, a style manual, a directory of U.S. government agencies in the state, and a checklist of statutory requirements for county records&quot;.

The Survey also innovated in archival practice. For example, it made use of new microfilm technology, experimented with its use in archiving, and advanced on previously existing practices.
A great deal of HRS work-product went unpublished; for example the HRS inventoried the historical records of more than 3,000 of the 3,143 U.S. counties but only published reports for 628 of them. A study of HRS usage found that HRS materials were often confused with FWP work product, and that genealogists and archivists were the most frequent users of HRS materials. Archivists sometimes use them as evidence that certain county or town-level materials were extant circa the 1930s, in hopes of urging local record keepers to release materials they hardly knew they had.

<doc id="545765" wikidata="Q408952" url="?curid=545765" title="Desmethylprodine">
<text>Desmethylprodine or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-4-propionoxypiperidine (MPPP, Ro 2-0718) is an opioid analgesic drug developed in the 1940s by researchers at Hoffmann-La Roche. Desmethylprodine has been labeled by the DEA as a Schedule I drug in the United States. It is an analog of pethidine (meperidine) a Schedule II drug. Chemically, it is a reversed ester of pethidine which has about 70% of the potency of morphine. Unlike its derivative prodine, it does not exhibit optical isomerism. It was reported to have 30 times the activity of pethidine and a greater analgesic effect than morphine in rats, and it was demonstrated to cause central nervous system stimulation in mice.

==History==
Desmethylprodine was first synthesized in 1947 at Hoffman-LaRoche Laboratories by Albert Ziering and John Lee. They found that it produced effects similar to morphine when administered to rats. Ziering had been searching for synthetic painkillers that were less addictive than morphine. The new drug was a slight variant of pethidine. It was found to be no more effective than pethidine and was never marketed. This research produced the analgesic alphaprodine (Nisentil, Prisilidine), a very closely related compound.

In the United States, MPPP is now in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act with a zero aggregate manufacturing quota as of 2014. The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.87 for the hydrochloride. It is listed under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and is controlled in most countries in the same fashion as is morphine.

==Toxic impurity==
In 1976, a 23-year-old graduate student in chemistry named Barry Kidston was searching for a way to make a legal recreational drug. Having read the paper by Ziering and Lee, he deduced that he could make a drug with pethidine&#x27;s effects without its legal restrictions, because desmethylprodine is a different molecule and had never been addressed by law. Kidston successfully synthesized and used desmethylprodine for several months, after which he suddenly came down with the symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and was hospitalized. Physicians were perplexed, because Parkinson&#x27;s disease would be a great rarity in someone so young, but L-DOPA, the standard drug for Parkinson&#x27;s, relieved his symptoms. L-DOPA is a precursor for dopamine, the neurotransmitter whose lack produces Parkinson&#x27;s symptoms.

It was later found that his development of Parkinson&#x27;s was due to a common impurity in the synthesis of MPPP called MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), a neurotoxin that specifically targets dopamine-producing neurons. The intermediate tertiary alcohol is liable to dehydration in acidic conditions if the reaction temperature rises above 30 °C. Kidston did not realize this and esterified the intermediate with propionic anhydride at an elevated temperature. Consequently, he produced MPTP as a major impurity.

1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a metabolite of MPTP, causes rapid onset of irreversible symptoms similar to Parkinson&#x27;s disease. MPTP is metabolized to the neurotoxin MPP+ by the enzyme MAO-B, which is expressed in glial cells. This selectively kills brain tissue in the area of the brain called the substantia nigra and causes permanent Parkinsonian symptoms.

==Analogs==
Structural analogs of desmethylprodine with different &quot;N&quot;-substituents than a methyl group on the piperidine have been investigated. Several of these have significantly greater &quot;in vitro&quot; potency compared to desmethylprodine.

<text>Founded in 1900, the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) is the world&#x27;s oldest and largest dental specialty organization. It represents nearly 19,000 orthodontist members throughout the United States, Canada and abroad. All orthodontists are dentists and may simultaneously hold membership in the American Dental Association. Its headquarters are in Creve Coeur, Missouri, near St. Louis.

Orthodontists are dental specialists in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of orthodontic problems who have completed two to four years of advanced training in an accredited orthodontic residency program. Only those dentists who have completed this training may call themselves &quot;orthodontists,&quot; and only orthodontists may be members of the American Association of Orthodontists.

In 2013 Gayle Glenn was elected as the first female president of the American Association of Orthodontists.

AAO is affiliated with the Canadian Association of Orthodontists.

<doc id="545767" wikidata="Q2270906" url="?curid=545767" title="Sunset Park, Brooklyn">
<text>Sunset Park is a neighborhood in the western part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, bounded by Park Slope and Green-Wood Cemetery to the north, Borough Park to the east, Bay Ridge to the south, and New York Harbor to the west. The neighborhood is named for a public park of the same name that covers between Fifth and Seventh Avenues from 41st to 44th Street. The area north of 36th Street is alternatively known as Greenwood Heights, while the section north of 20th Street is also called South Slope.

The area was initially occupied by the Canarsee band of Munsee-speaking Lenape until the first European settlement occurred in 1636. Through the late 19th century, Sunset Park was sparsely developed and was considered part of Bay Ridge or South Brooklyn. The arrival of elevated railways and the subway led to Sunset Park&#x27;s development, with middle-class row houses and industrial buildings being erected in the 1890s through the 1920s. After the decline of the industrial hubs in the 1940s and 1950s, the name &quot;Sunset Park&quot; was given to the region north of 65th Street as part of an urban renewal initiative. Immigrant groups started moving to the neighborhood in the late 20th century due to its relative affordability. By the 21st century, the neighborhood&#x27;s population is primarily composed of Scandinavian, Irish, Italian, Hispanics and Chinese immigrants along with swaths of predominantly white young urban professionals.

Sunset Park is part of Brooklyn Community District 7. It is patrolled by the 72nd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Fire services are provided by the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s Engine Company 201 and Engine Company 228/Ladder Company 114. Politically, Sunset Park is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 38th and 39th Districts.

== History ==

=== Early settlement ===
Though modern-day Brooklyn is coextensive with Kings County, this was not always the case. South Brooklyn, an area in central Kings County extending to the former Brooklyn city line near Green-Wood Cemetery&#x27;s southern border, was originally settled by the Canarsee, one of several indigenous Lenape peoples who farmed and hunted on the land. The Canarsee had several routes that crossed Brooklyn, including a path from Fulton Ferry along the East River that extended southward to Gowanus Creek, South Brooklyn (present-day Sunset Park), and Bay Ridge. The Canarsee traded with other indigenous peoples, and by the early 17th century, also with Dutch and English settlers.

The first European settlement occurred in 1636 when Willem Adriaenszen Bennett and Jacques Bentyn purchased between 28th and 60th Streets, in what is now Sunset Park. However, after the land was purchased in the 1640s by Dutch settlers who laid out their farms along the waterfront, the Canarsee were soon displaced, and had left Brooklyn by the 18th century. The area comprising modern Sunset Park was divided between two Dutch towns: Brooklyn to the northwest and New Utrecht to the southeast, divided by a boundary that ran diagonally from Seventh Avenue/60th Street to Ninth Avenue/37th Street. The Dutch created long, narrow farms in the area. When New Netherland was conveyed to the English in 1664, the latter improved the waterfront pathway in the town of Brooklyn as part of a Gowanus (Coast) Road, which ran southwest to an east–west trail called Martense&#x27;s Lane, then southward to the boundary with New Utrecht. These roads would be used during the American Revolutionary War in the Battle of Long Island.

During the American Revolution, the area was mostly owned by the descendants of Hans Hansen Bergen, an early immigrant from Norway. They owned two homesteads, the DeHart-Bergen House close to 37th Street and the Johannes Bergen House around 55th Street; the former was used by the British during the Revolution. In addition, the Bergens owned several slaves, as indicated in the 1800 United States census, where 19 slaves and 8 free non-whites were recorded living at the two Bergen houses. After New York abolished slavery in 1827, there were 55 African Americans living in the area. Similar to Dutch farms, the farms in modern Sunset Park occupied long, narrow plots.

=== 19th century ===

==== Early growth and transit hub ====
Brooklyn became urbanized in the 19th century, with many people choosing to live in Brooklyn and commute to Manhattan, and residential development started spreading outward from Brooklyn Heights. Present-day Sunset Park, several miles away from Brooklyn Heights, was still primarily agricultural in the 1830s and remained that way until the middle of the 19th century. Among the few houses in the region was the Kent Castle, a Gothic Revival villa on present-day 59th Street.

After Brooklyn was incorporated as a city in 1834, the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1839 was devised, a street plan that extended to South Brooklyn. What would become Sunset Park was incorporated into the Eighth Ward of the city of Brooklyn, which at the time was the city&#x27;s least populous ward. Sunset Park did not have its own name until the 20th century; rather, the neighborhoods in southern Brooklyn, including Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst, and Bath Beach, were collectively referred to as a single area. The first major development in the region was Green-Wood Cemetery, which opened in 1840 near the boundary of South Brooklyn and Bay Ridge, and quickly became popular as a tourist attraction. By 1870, the first frame row houses were constructed in the Eighth Ward, ultimately replacing the detached wooden houses in the area.

Transit to South Brooklyn started with the 1846 establishment of a ferry service to the cemetery. The Brooklyn City Railroad, founded in 1853, started offering stagecoach service from Fulton Ferry to destinations such as Bay Ridge. Afterward, several excursion railroads were built from South Brooklyn to the resort areas of Coney Island, Brighton Beach, and Manhattan Beach. These included the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Rail Road; the New York, Bay Ridge and Jamaica Railroad; and the New York and Sea Beach Railroad. A ferry pier and railroad terminal, popular as a transfer point for those traveling to Coney Island, was built in the 1870s. The 39th Street Ferry started traveling to the Battery Maritime Building in Manhattan in 1887, followed two years later by the opening of the Fifth Avenue elevated train line in the neighborhood. Following the establishment of the ferry, the Eighth Ward finally became a desirable place to live.

==== Increasing residential development ====
After the establishment of transport to the Eighth Ward, the region began to quickly develop as a residential neighborhood, with the first speculatively-developed houses being built in the mid-1880s. In 1888, landowners delivered &quot;a petition for local improvements&quot; to be effected upon some 7,500 lots located from Third to Ninth Avenues between 39th and 65th Streets, which were estimated to be worth about $1 million (). The landowners requested that sewers be installed, and that the streets be paved and opened. The bill was passed the next year with minor changes. By August 1890, the Brooklyn commissioners were opening several streets in South Brooklyn. This was followed by the provision of funding for water mains in October 1890, and a similar act for gas mains in 1892. South Brooklyn&#x27;s development was also helped by the conversion of the Third Avenue stagecoach line to a steam-powered route. The conversion occurred in spite of several opponents, who argued that steam engines would spook horses.

Most of the initial housing stock was centered around Fourth and Fifth Avenues. Further development was hindered by the area&#x27;s steep and irregular topography, which resulted in some lots being higher than the streets they were located on. This could be seen in the proposed southward expansion of the Fifth Avenue elevated, which faced elevation changes of up to 90 feet if it was to continue southward along the same elevation. This would be remedied by rerouting the elevated to Third Avenue south of 38th Street. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; wrote in 1893 that one could &quot;find lands that are now vacant covered with dwellings and factories, broken and uneven and uninviting paths transformed into broad avenues lined with stores and people in them. Buildings are going up with great rapidity—not singly or rarely so, but by blocks.&quot; The extension of the Fifth Avenue elevated opened to a 65th Street terminal on Third Avenue (with connections to Bay Ridge streetcar lines) on October 1, 1893.

Development in South Brooklyn continued even though the Panic of 1893 had resulted in the stoppage of nearly all developments in the rest of Brooklyn. Due to the large number of residential developments being built in South Brooklyn, in 1893 the Brooklyn city government banned the erection of wood-framed structures between Fourth and Fifth Avenues south of 39th Street. By 1895, the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; noted, &quot;Probably no ward in the city has been built up as rapidly as the Eighth Ward.&quot; Two-story on basement row houses were the most common building class to be erected in modern-day Sunset Park in the 1900s and 1910s due to their wide appeal, with the majority of these being two-family homes. On the avenues, row houses were built with commercial space on the ground floor, and the residential units were located above. The &quot;Eagle&quot; said in 1901 that two-family houses were &quot;particularly attractive to people who desire comparatively small apartments, but who object to living in flats, and they appeal to this class on account of their being more quiet, and possibly, more exclusive.&quot; A notable exception to this was the group of single-family homes in central Sunset Park, though these were also easy to build.

==== Major projects ====

The growth of the Eighth Ward was helped by the development of Sunset Park, a public park initially bounded by Fifth and Seventh Avenues between 41st and 43rd Streets. The city of Brooklyn acquired the land in 1891 as part of its plan to build several parks citywide. The park would be expanded southward to 44th Street in 1904. The park was so named because its elevated location provided views of the sunset to the west. Though development of the park was precluded by its irregular topography, nevertheless it became a popular gathering place for Bay Ridge and South Brooklyn residents. Residential construction boomed in the late 19th and early 20th century amid real estate speculation initiated by the construction of the park and the Fifth Avenue elevated line. By 1909, there was significant development in the area surrounding the park, and the immediate surrounding area became known as &quot;Sunset Park&quot; as well.

Growth of the neighborhood also came with the development of the South Brooklyn waterfront. At the time, it was sparsely developed; there had only been one warehouse on the waterfront in 1890. The land contained an oil refinery belonging to the Bush &amp; Denslow company of Rufus T. Bush. Standard Oil bought this refinery in the 1880s and dismantled it, but after Rufus T. Bush&#x27;s death in 1890, his son Irving T. Bush bought the land back. Irving Bush built six warehouses on the site between 1895 and 1897, but soon observed their inefficiency, and instead devised plans for Bush Terminal, a combined shipping/warehousing complex between 32nd and 51st Streets. Construction began in 1902, and was completed in stages between 1911 and 1926. It was dubbed &quot;Bush&#x27;s Folly&quot; at the time of its construction, as people had a hard time believing it could compete with the port of Manhattan.

=== Early 20th century ===

==== Subway construction ====

A building boom in South Brooklyn started in about 1902 and 1903, and thousands of people started coming to the area from Manhattan and from other places. The first definite plans for a Fourth Avenue subway (today&#x27;s ) were proposed by Rapid Transit Commission engineer William Barclay Parsons in 1903, and two years later, a citizens&#x27; committee was created to aid the creation of the subway line. The announcement of the subway line resulted in the immediate development of row houses in Sunset Park and Bay Ridge. In 1905 and 1906 realty values increased by about 100 percent, and land values increased due to the promise of improved transportation access. Such was the rate of development, houses were being sold before they were even completed, and land prices could rise significantly just within several hours.

The subway itself faced delays. In 1905, the Rapid Transit Commission adopted the Fourth Avenue route to Fort Hamilton; following approval by the Board of Estimate and mayor of New York City, the route was approved by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. Bids for construction and operation were let, but in 1907, the Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded by the Public Service Commission (PSC). For much of 1908, there were legal disagreements about whether the project could be funded while remaining within the city&#x27;s debt limit. The PSC voted unanimously for the Fourth Avenue subway line in March 1908, but the Board of Estimate did not approve contracts for the line until October 1909. By then, a non-partisan political body, with the backing of 25,000 South Brooklyn residents, was created that would only support candidates in the municipal election that pledged support for the Fourth Avenue subway.

Groundbreaking for the first section of the subway, between DeKalb Avenue and 43rd Street, took place in 1909. Not long after the contracts were awarded, the PSC started negotiating with the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company in the execution of the Dual Contracts, which were signed in 1913. During the Dual System negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway was recommended as part of the Dual System, which was approved in 1912. Construction began on the sections between 61st–89th Streets and between 43rd–61st Streets in 1913, and was completed two years later. The line opened to 59th Street on June 21, 1915, except the 45th Street and 53rd Street stations, which opened on September 22, 1915. A &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; article from the time said: &quot;All along the line of the railroads there are plainly visible the result of the advertising of the contracts for the construction of the 4th av subway.&quot;

==== Middle-class residents ====
Though many row house districts in New York City housed wealthy professionals and businesspeople, Sunset Park was developed as a middle-class area, with most residents being either mid-level professionals (such as clerks and bookkeepers) or skilled tradespeople, including carpenters and plumbers. At the time, row houses were falling out of favor with the upper class, which had started gravitating toward detached single-family homes in more suburban areas, notably exemplified by the garden city movement and the Prospect Park South and Ditmas Park developments in nearby Flatbush. With many examples clad in brownstone (a style that had largely become old-fashioned by the late 1890s) to evoke the grandeur of earlier neighborhoods, the row houses in Sunset Park were a viable option for middle-class families who could not afford to move to the suburbs or into single-family houses. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; wrote that &quot;the general tendency seems to be to develop Greater South Brooklyn in such a way that families possessed of moderate incomes may there establish themselves...under conditions which will not put too heavy a strain on the purse&quot;. For the majority of two-family row houses in Sunset Park, which were speculatively developed for no specific tenants, the owner&#x27;s family lived in one unit and rented the other out. Many row houses were extremely crowded, often housing ten or more people across both units. Other residences in Sunset Park were single units or apartment buildings.

While many of the first residents in southern Sunset Park were initially Irish, German, Italians or Eastern European Jews, by the 1910s there was a growing Scandinavian district. Portions of the neighborhood became known as &quot;Finntown&quot; and &quot;Little Norway&quot;. Finntown is located in the northern part of modern Sunset Park, surrounding the park of the same name, bounded by 5th Avenue to the west and 8th Avenue to the east, 39th Street to the north and 45th Street to the south. The Finns brought with them the concept of cooperative housing, and the Alku and Alku Toinen apartment house at 816 43rd Street is said to be the first cooperative apartment building in New York City. The Norwegian community in Bay Ridge, the largest in the city, stretched between Fourth and Eighth Avenues south of 45th Street at its peak in World War II.

During the peak periods of construction in Sunset Park, hundreds of developers were involved with constructing row houses in the neighborhood; many were neighborhood residents or had offices in the area, and most were not formally trained as architects. Reflecting a longstanding builder-oriented business culture in Brooklyn, these developers often reused building designs that were easy to erect and advertise. The most prolific developer was Thomas Bennett, who lived in Sunset Park and designed at least 600 structures in the neighborhood. Alongside tenements and apartment houses stemming from the nationally prosperous 1914–1929 era, the area was characterized by &quot;limestones and brownstones, as well and brick and wood rowhouses&quot;. Bush Terminal continued to grow through World War II. During the conflict, the adjacent Brooklyn Army Terminal (situated between 58th and 65th Streets) employed more than 10,000 civilians, handled of cargo, and was the point of departure for 3.5 million soldiers.

=== Decline ===
Slumlike conditions proliferated in the vicinity of First and Second Avenues as early as World War I, and the Great Depression forced some residents to take in boarders; at the time, 60 percent of Sunset Park&#x27;s male residents belonged to trade unions. After the Depression, the western section of the neighborhood began to decline in earnest. This was due to &quot;redlining&quot; implemented after the Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation, a federal agency, released color-coded maps in the late 1930s, indicating which neighborhoods were &quot;desirable&quot; for investments and which neighborhoods should be avoided. Most of present-day Sunset Park was given a &quot;C&quot; rating, indicating a locale that was &quot;definitely declining&quot;, while the waterfront on the western part of the neighborhood was given a &quot;D&quot; rating, the lowest possible rating. These ratings were, on the most part, unscientific and motivated by racial and ethnic discrimination. The HOLC contended that the brownstones and the newly built Sunset Park Play Center were positive attributes of the neighborhood, but that the overall rating of the area was revised downward due to its industrial uses and the high numbers of Italian immigrants east of Seventh Avenue.

A 1943 demographic study of New York City (co-published by four local newspapers as the &quot;New York City Market Analysis&quot;) assigned the Sunset Park moniker to an area largely corresponding to the neighborhood&#x27;s contemporary boundaries, possibly marking its first use in a more generalized context beyond the residential area surrounding the park. While denoting the redlining-induced socioeconomic decline of the waterfront, it revealed that the uphill section was more affluent than other residential, white ethnic-dominated areas adjacent to the city&#x27;s industrial and maritime economies. However, the rapid development of Sunset Park had forestalled the emergence of upper middle class apartment houses that took root in comparable neighborhoods throughout the early 20th century; coupled with the impact of the waterfront, Sunset Park&#x27;s aggregate average and median household expenditures were more analogous to the redlined working class neighborhoods that had arisen in once-affluent areas following Brooklyn&#x27;s consolidation into the City of Greater New York. The area also remained considerably poorer than adjacent districts with detached housing stock and the semi-suburban belt of south-central and southeastern Brooklyn neighborhoods primarily developed after consolidation. Nevertheless, because of the historical prominence of owner-occupied housing in the area prior to the widespread emergence of cooperative housing in apartment-oriented neighborhoods, Sunset Park&#x27;s homeownership rate was at least as high as some of the city&#x27;s wealthiest communities.

The elevated Gowanus Parkway was constructed on the structure of the elevated BMT Third Avenue Line in 1941, despite protests by 500 residents. This resulted in the downfall of one of the neighborhood&#x27;s main commercial arteries. With the rise of truck-based freight shipping and ports in New Jersey, as well as the decreasing importance of heavy industry in the northeastern United States, Sunset Park&#x27;s shipping sector entered a period of decline after World War II. In 1945, Third Avenue was widened to ten lanes at the surface level to accommodate truck traffic to and from the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel. This widening necessitated the removal of all industrial buildings and housing on the east side of the avenue, destroying the rest of the business district built around the Third Avenue Line. The four-lane Gowanus Parkway was replaced in the 1960s with a six-lane expressway of the same name to carry truck and car traffic to and from the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, which opened in 1964. During this period, Fourth Avenue&#x27;s sidewalks were narrowed by roughly eight feet to further accommodate vehicular traffic.

Third Avenue and the waterfront district soon evolved into a haven for prostitution and drug use, a milieu evoked by Hubert Selby Jr. in &quot;Last Exit to Brooklyn&quot; (1964). According to longtime resident and community activist Tony Giordano, the Scandinavian population coexisted with upwardly mobile Irish and Italians who had moved from less desirable parts of South Brooklyn, such as Gowanus and western Park Slope. While this influx would influence the community&#x27;s businesses and religious institutions for decades, many of these residents proved to be transient amid redlining-driven white flight to adjoining areas (including Bay Ridge, Staten Island, and inner suburbs in the New York metropolitan area), leading to the increasing prominence of the neighborhood&#x27;s Puerto Rican community. Though Sunset Park had a small Puerto Rican community centered around the maritime trades as early as the 1920s, it grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s when urban renewal projects in Manhattan pushed them away from longstanding enclaves in the Upper West Side, East Harlem and the Lower East Side. The neighborhood was particularly desirable because it still retained a large number of industrial jobs on the waterfront, to the west of Third Avenue. However, the closure of the Brooklyn Army Terminal in 1966 and general downsizing at Bush Terminal would negatively affect the nascent community. Collectively, over 30,000 jobs were eliminated as a result of industrial closures in Sunset Park between the 1950s and the 1970s.

As families who had lived in the area for decades began moving out, the housing stock lost value. Most of the housing inventory in the waterfront district failed to comply with a 1961 zoning resolution that subjected 2,000 residences to &quot;rigid prohibitions against reconstruction [...], improvements [or] certain kinds of repairs&quot;; this rapidly hastened predatory blockbusting practices. In &quot;The Power Broker&quot;, the 1974 biography of urban planner Robert Moses, author Robert Caro noted that elements of blight extended to the comparatively affluent, brownstone-dominated tracts between Fourth and Sixth Avenues by the 1960s.

=== Redevelopment ===

==== Late 20th century ====
Prior to the 1960s, much of the modern-day Sunset Park neighborhood was considered part of Bay Ridge, except for the area around the park itself, belying Sunset Park&#x27;s origins as a ward of the city of Brooklyn and Bay Ridge&#x27;s evolution from the Yellow Hook district of the town of New Utrecht, which remained independent from the city until 1894. According to Tony Giordano, more affluent residents of southern Bay Ridge considered the &quot;tough&quot; neighborhood to be somewhat distinct from their community, often characterizing the district as &quot;Lower Bay Ridge&quot;, while many residents of Sunset Park &quot;wished they lived in the richer Bay Ridge and enjoyed using the name on their own&quot;. Following a 1966 petition drive, Sunset Park was formally designated as a poverty area under the aegis of the Office of Economic Opportunity. As part of this process, it received its current moniker and boundaries. With aid from federal, state, and local agencies, Sunset Park slowly began redeveloping. Major factors included the purchase of Bush Terminal by new investors in 1963 and its conversion into an industrial park; the gradual loosening of the 1961 zoning regulations; and the expansion of Lutheran Medical Center to the waterfront American Machine and Foundry factory in the 1970s.

However, due to collusion between the banking and real estate industries and actors in the Federal Housing Administration against the Puerto Rican community, hundreds of housing units were soon lost to abandonment. According to writer David Ment, beginning in the late 1960s, &quot;real estate speculators often used [blockbusting] tactics to purchase homes, then obtained inflated appraisals and mortgage insurance from the [...] FHA.&quot; Even though these homes were renovated shoddily, they were sold to lower-income families who then went into foreclosure because of unaffordable maintenance costs. The speculators then collected the balance of the mortgage, which had been insured by the FHA; this resulted in several FHA officials and speculators being indicted for fraud, though by that time, &quot;the resulting abandonment could not be reversed.&quot; According to Louis Winnick, over &quot;200 small properties and 40 apartment buildings&quot; remained abandoned as late as 1977, while &quot;the blocks below (and often above) Fourth Avenue were defaced by the stigmata of dereliction.&quot;

The Sunset Park Redevelopment Committee, founded in 1969 to help the expansion of Lutheran Medical Center, started reclaiming some of the blighted homes, though to little success at first. An initial federal grant of $500,000 failed to effect a redevelopment. By the early 1980s, people were willing to move to Sunset Park due to its high number of affordable units. At that point, the Sunset Park Redevelopment Committee had renovated about 200 units and had federal funds for 333 more.

Another factor in the redevelopment of Sunset Park was the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which removed racially-based restrictions on immigration to the United States, causing the area to be developed by new immigrants from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. By the 1980s, other Latin American immigrants (including Dominican, Ecuadorian and Mexican Americans) had started populating Sunset Park. These new residents started improving formerly decrepit properties in Sunset Park. In addition, Chinese immigrants settled in the area in large numbers. Most of these people worked in service jobs such as garment factories or restaurants, but they were also able to buy homes and start their own companies. Author Tarry Hum stated that these residents&#x27; interest in Sunset Park row houses was &quot;an important neighborhood amenity that … helped stem the area&#x27;s decline&quot;.

By the 1980s, there was also interest in redeveloping Sunset Park as an industrial hub. The city government bought the Brooklyn Army Terminal in 1981, and renovated it for manufacturing use; the first industrial tenants signed leases for space in the terminal in 1987. Industry City was also successful, and was 98 percent occupied by 1980.

==== 21st century ====
Following the 1966 poverty area designation, the area from 36th Street to the Prospect Expressway was incorporated into Sunset Park. As the gentrification of South Brooklyn accelerated in the 2000s, this area was rebranded as Greenwood Heights, or as South Slope.

The 2000s and 2010s brought new development to Sunset Park. In February 2016, Sunset Park West was one of four neighborhoods featured in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about &quot;New York&#x27;s Next Hot Neighborhoods&quot;. Factors cited in the article included redevelopment along the waterfront in Industry City and Bush Terminal, the 2014 opening of Bush Terminal Park, and the use of warehouses as party and event spaces. According to real-estate sources, all of these business- and office-related activities will &quot;drive residential momentum&quot; in the western part of Sunset Park. Some in the neighborhood have expressed fears of the gentrification that could follow in the wake of these developments. Industry City&#x27;s owners announced a $1 billion renovation plan in March 2015, while a &quot;Made in NY&quot; industrial campus was announced for Bush Terminal in 2017.

== Demographics ==
Sunset Park is divided into two neighborhood tabulation areas, Sunset Park West and Sunset Park East, which collectively comprise the population of Sunset Park. Based on data from the 2010 United States census, the population of Sunset Park was 126,381, a change of 7,919 (6.3%) from the 118,462 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood in 2019 was estimated to be 20.8% Asian, 3.9% Black, 23.7% Hispanic, 49.6% White.

The entirety of Community Board 7 had 132,721 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 82.6 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 22% are between the ages of 0 and 17, 39% between 25 and 44, and 21% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, both at 9%.

As of 2016, the median household income in Community Board 7 was $56,787. In 2018, an estimated 29% of Sunset Park residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in twelve residents (8%) was unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 57% in Sunset Park, higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Sunset Park is considered to be gentrifying.

===2020 census===
The 2020 census data from the New York City Department of City Planning is divided into three neighborhood tabulation areas: West Sunset Park, Central Sunset Park, and East Sunset Park–West Borough Park. West Sunset Park had 54,473 residents; Central Sunset Park, 55,606 residents; and East Sunset Park–West Borough Park, 35,632 residents.

The racial makeup of West Sunset Park was 56.2% (30,638) White, 5.0% (2,740) African American, 13.1% (7,139) Asian, 1.1% (597) from other races, and 2.4% (1,286) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 22.2% (12,073) of the population. The racial makeup of Central Sunset Park was 8.1% (4,509) White, 1.1% (610) African American, 56.5% (31,444) Asian, 0.5% (280) from other races, and 1.0% (537) from two or more races.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 35.2% (44,538) of the population.

=== Ethnic groups ===

Sunset Park&#x27;s main population is made up of Europeans. The first major ethnic group to immigrate to the area in the 1840s was the Irish. This was followed by Polish and Nordic Americans in the late 19th century and by, Italians in the 20th century. In particular, Nordic immigrants are among one of the largest ethnic groups in Sunset Park and Bay Ridge. The Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes are mostly maritime workers who settled near the waterfront, while Finns are mostly tenant farmers or non-landowning laborers.

An early ethnic enclave in Sunset Park was Finntown, an enclave of Finnish immigrants in northern Sunset Park, which is composed of Finnish immigrants as well as small amounts of other Scandinavian groups. The enclave has 10,000 Finnish residents and at one point, had its own Finnish language newspaper. In 1916, Finntown became the site of the first non-profit housing cooperative in the United States when the Finnish Home Building Association built two cooperative houses, named Alku and Alku Toinen (translated respectively to &quot;Beginning&quot; and &quot;Beginning Second&quot;), at 816 and 826 43rd Street. By 1922, the Finns had constructed twenty co-ops in Sunset Park. These initially catered primarily to the area&#x27;s Finnish population, but others of European descent also lived in these co-ops. In honor of the Finnish community that inhabited Sunset Park, a block of 40th Street, in front of the Imatra Society building at 740 40th Street, was co-named &quot;Finlandia Street&quot; in 1991.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Sunset Park saw an influx of Latin American and Asian immigrants. At first migrants came from Puerto Rico, and by the 1980s other Latin American immigrants including Cuban, Dominican, Ecuadorian, and Mexican Americans had started populating Sunset Park. By the 1980 United States census, 10% of the residents were Hispanic, compared with less than 5% in the 1970 United States census; meanwhile, the number of white residents had decreased greatly. The newer residents tended to be poorer, leading to claims of &quot;de-gentrification&quot;.

In the 1980s, Sunset Park became the location of the borough&#x27;s first Chinatown, which is located along Eighth Avenue roughly between 44th and 68th Streets. The avenue is lined with Chinese businesses, including grocery stores, restaurants, Buddhist temples, video stores, bakeries, community organizations, and a Hong Kong Supermarket. Like the Manhattan Chinatown (of which the Brooklyn Chinatown is an extension), Brooklyn&#x27;s Chinatown was originally settled by Cantonese immigrants. In the 2000s, an influx of Fuzhou immigrants supplanted the Cantonese at a significantly faster rate than in Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown; this trend had slowed down by the end of the decade, with fewer Fuzhouese coming to Sunset Park each year. By 2009 many Mandarin speakers had moved to Sunset Park.

People from India (primarily hailing from the state of Gujarat&#x27;s minority Christian communities) also started settling in and around Sunset Park in 1974. The ethnic diversity of the neighborhood is celebrated annually with the Parade of Flags down Fifth Avenue, which started in 1994. The core of the Hispanic population is west of Fifth Avenue, while the Scandinavian population is mainly concentrated along Eighth Avenue. The Chinese population straddles the area from Seventh Avenue eastward to Borough Park, one of Brooklyn&#x27;s fastest-growing Chinatowns.

== Land use ==

According to &quot;The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn&quot;, Sunset Park is bounded to the north by the Prospect Expressway and the Park Slope neighborhood, to the east by Ninth Avenue and the Borough Park neighborhood, to the south by 65th Street and the Bay Ridge neighborhood, and to the west by New York Harbor. The region north of 36th Street is also known as Greenwood Heights or South Slope.

The areas west of Third Avenue are zoned mostly for light industrial usage and as such, mainly contain factories, cargo storage and other industrial buildings. The areas east of Third Avenue, as well as a small area west of Third Avenue between 54th and 57th Streets, are zoned for low-rise residential buildings, including row houses and short apartment structures. Generally, commercial areas are restricted to the ground floors of buildings on Third, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Eighth Avenues. Light industrial zoning is also present south of 61st and 62nd Streets.

=== Residential stock ===

The neighborhood&#x27;s &quot;brownstone belt&quot; includes homes with brownstone, sandstone, limestone, iron, and ornamental stone-brick facades, though the majority of homes in Sunset Park are faced with brick. Developed mostly between 1892 and 1910 following earlier frame house development, it is dominated by two-story-above-basement, bayed row houses that were envisaged as &quot;inexpensive imitations of the stately four- and five-story townhouses [...] of Brooklyn Heights, Carroll Gardens, Fort Greene and Park Slope.&quot; Though their facades were analogous to the less expensive tier of one-family row houses elsewhere in Brooklyn, most of these structures were in fact built as two-family residences. In addition, several low-rise apartment buildings were erected in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The row houses and apartment buildings were both intended for the neighborhood&#x27;s middle-class residents. The two-family row houses came in two types. The cheaper row houses contained an undesignated English basement and one unit on each of the first (or stoop-level) and second floors. More expensive row houses had a subterranean cellar, raised, ground-level basement and first (or parlor) floor as a single triplex unit, and the second floor as another unit.

Although many row houses have shed internal architectural elements of the era, they continue to encompass a substantial swath of the residential stock between Fourth and Sixth Avenues south of 40th Street. However, brownstone rows exist as far north as 420-424 36th Street and as far east as 662 56th Street, while several bayed brick rows (notably exemplified by 240-260 45th Street) are situated south of Fourth Avenue, where wood frame and frame-brick houses dating from the earliest development in the area remain prevalent. While these houses retained their polychrome facades and other Victorian-era design flourishes (akin to the &quot;painted ladies&quot; of San Francisco) as late as 1940, most have been clad in vinyl siding and Formstone for decades.

In addition, there are numerous multi-family residences in Sunset Park. Some of these residences are three-family homes, spread across three stories, similar in design to the neighborhood&#x27;s row houses. Others are small four- or five-story apartments with multiple dwellings, similar to tenements. Many of the Finnish-built cooperative apartment buildings contained open courts within them. Along Fourth and Fifth Avenue, there are several buildings with commercial space on their ground floors and residential units above.

=== Official landmarks ===
==== City landmarks ====

The neighborhood has several individual landmarks designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission:
* Dr. Maurice T. Lewis House, designed by R. Thomas Short of the prominent Manhattan architectural firm Harde &amp; Short, and built in 1907 for Lewis, a physician and president of the nearby Bay Ridge Savings Bank. It is one of Short&#x27;s few projects outside of Manhattan and the neighborhood&#x27;s only freestanding mansion, serving as Lewis&#x27;s home until his death in 1931. From 1931 to 1996, the building was owned by Sonya Monen, the first female physician to serve in the United States Coast Guard Reserve&#x27;s SPARS division (as a lieutenant commander) during World War II.
* Sunset Park Courthouse, built in 1930–1931 in the Neoclassical style.

The two-story houses are Renaissance Revival buildings constructed between 1903 and 1908, while the flats were constructed between 1910 and 1914.

==== National Register of Historic Places listings ====

A portion of the neighborhood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as a historic district, known for its Romanesque and Renaissance Revival architecture. It is the largest historic district on the NRHP in the Northeast United States. The Brooklyn Army Terminal, a massive former warehousing complex converted into an industrial park, is located west of Second Avenue between 59th and 65th Streets and is individually listed on the NRHP. At its construction in 1919, it was the world&#x27;s largest concrete building complex.

The former 18th Police Precinct Station House and Stable is also on the NRHP in addition to being a city landmark. Other NRHP listings include the Ninth Avenue station, the Alku and Alku Toinen buildings, and the Fourth Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church. Additionally, within the portion of Greenwood Heights that overlaps with Sunset Park, the entirety of Green-Wood Cemetery is a National Historic Landmark, and the Storehouse No. 2, U.S. Navy Fleet Supply Base and the Weir Greenhouse are NRHP sites.

== Green space ==
There are several public parks in Sunset Park, which are operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.

=== Sunset Park ===
Sunset Park&#x27;s namesake is a public park located between 41st and 44th Streets and Fifth and Seventh Avenues. The park&#x27;s elevated location offers views of New York Harbor; Manhattan; the Statue of Liberty; and, more distantly, the hills of Staten Island and the U.S. state of New Jersey. The modern-day park contains a playground, recreation center, and pool. The latter two comprise the Sunset Play Center, which is a New York City designated landmark.

The land for the park was acquired in 1891 through 1905 and initially contained a pond, golf course, rustic shelter, and carousel. These features were removed in 1935–1936 when the current neoclassical/Art Deco style pool was built by Aymar Embury II during a Works Progress Administration project. The facility was one of eleven opened in 1936 by city parks commissioner Robert Moses and mayor Fiorello LaGuardia.

=== Greenways ===
The Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway, a off-street path, runs on the waterfront of Sunset Park. The greenway is planned to connect neighborhoods along Brooklyn&#x27;s waterfront, running through the Industry City complex to the Owls Head Park in Bay Ridge, which is also served by the Sunset Park Greenway. One component of the greenway is Bush Terminal Piers Park, a green space between 43rd and 50th Streets that contains a pedestrian and bike path as well as baseball and soccer fields. Bush Terminal Piers Park opened in November 2014.

=== Other parks ===
Sunset Park also has several smaller playgrounds:
* D&#x27;Emic Playground at Third Avenue between 34th and 35th Streets
* Gonzalo Plasencia Playground at Third Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets
* John Allen Payne Playground at Third Avenue between 64th and 65th Streets
* Martin Luther Playground at Second Avenue between 55th and 56th Streets
* Pena Herrera Playground at Third Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets
* Rainbow Playground at Sixth Avenue between 55th and 56th Streets

NYC Parks also maintains a number of smaller park spaces, including triangles, pedestrian malls and strips, and areas with seating. These are technically classified as parks but do not serve a recreational purpose. However, the Sunset Park neighborhood generally lacks recreational space, other than the playgrounds and the eponymous park; the playgrounds that do exist are mostly paved asphalt play areas.

=== Green-Wood Cemetery ===

North of 39th Street and east of Fifth Avenue is Green-Wood Cemetery. Opened in 1840, it has been described as &quot;Brooklyn&#x27;s first public park by default&quot; prior to Prospect Park&#x27;s construction. Green-Wood Cemetery contains 600,000 graves and 7,000 trees spread out over .

== Religion ==

Sunset Park has numerous churches and other places of worship. While many of these places of worship are Roman Catholic or Pentecostal churches, there are also several mosques. Several places of worship are composed according to ethnicity. For instance, a 2013 guidebook stated that there were over 15 churches devoted to Hispanic congregations on Third through Sixth Avenues, while there were Chinese congregations on Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Three mosques are located in the vicinity of 59th/60th Streets and Eighth Avenue. Conversely, several churches have multi-ethnic congregations, including the Grace Baptist Church and Second Evangelical Free Church.

Sunset Park includes several architecturally prominent religious institutions. St. Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, an early Romanesque structure on Fourth Avenue at 42nd Street, built in 1903–1905 to a design by Raymond F. Almirall. Another is Our Lady of Perpetual Help, the largest church in Brooklyn, located on Fifth Avenue between 59th and 60th Streets. The church was founded in 1893–1894 at the same location, and the current building was finished in the 1920s. The presence of Our Lady of Perpetual Help indicated the large Catholic population that originally settled in Sunset Park. Additionally, at least five churches within Sunset Park are designed in the Neo Gothic style.

Farther north is the Parish of St. Rocco, a Roman Catholic parish, housed in a former Norwegian Lutheran church on 27th Street. The Church of Our Lady of Czestochowa-St. Casimir, located nearby on 25th Street, is another Roman Catholic parish; its red-brick building was designed in 1904 by John Ryan in the Gothic style.

== Education ==

Sunset Park generally has a lower ratio of college-educated residents than the rest of the city . While 30% of residents age 25 and older have a college education or higher, 41% have less than a high school education and 29% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 40% of Brooklynites and 38% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Sunset Park students excelling in reading and math has been increasing, with reading achievement rising from 44 percent in 2000 to 54 percent in 2011, and math achievement rising from 39 percent to 67 percent within the same period.

Sunset Park&#x27;s rate of elementary school student absenteeism is lower than the rest of New York City. In Sunset Park, 9% of elementary school students missed twenty or more days per school year, compared to the citywide average of 20% of students. Additionally, 75% of high school students in Sunset Park graduate on time, equal to the citywide average of 75% of students. According to the Minnesota Population Center&#x27;s 2011–2015 analysis of the American Community Survey, the most common language spoken at home in Community District 7 was Spanish, followed by English and Chinese.

=== Library ===
The Sunset Park branch of the Brooklyn Public Library is located at 5108 Fourth Avenue. It was founded in 1905 and was initially located in a two-story on basement Classical Revival structure, a Carnegie library designed by Lord and Hewlett. Known colloquially as the &quot;Fourth Avenue library&quot;, the library was officially designated as the South Branch and frequently utilized by students from the adjacent district of Borough Park due to the lack of comparable resources at that neighborhood&#x27;s storefront branch on Thirteenth Avenue. Following a serious 1970 fire, the old library was demolished and rebuilt, reopening in January 1972. A redevelopment of the library site was proposed in 2014 and approved in 2017; the plan calls for a library and 49 affordable housing units to be constructed at 5108 Fourth Avenue. In May 2018, a temporary branch was opened at 4201 Fourth Avenue, between 42nd and 43rd Streets.

== Transportation ==
=== Road ===
Sunset Park has access to three limited-access highways: the I-278 (Gowanus) and NY 27 (Prospect) Expressways as well as the Belt Parkway. The Gowanus Expressway runs on the western side of the neighborhood while the Prospect Expressway runs to the north, near Park Slope. The Belt Parkway only serves the southwestern corner of Sunset Park. While I-278 has exits to the Sunset Park waterfront at 38th-39th Streets, there are no entrances to the highway from these streets, forcing traffic bound for I-278 to use local streets. In addition, numerous local streets are designated as truck routes, including the Gowanus and Prospect Expressways, Third Avenue, and parts of several other streets.

=== Buses and commuter vans ===
Six New York City Bus lines serve Sunset Park:

* B9: to Bay Ridge or Kings Plaza via 60th Street
* B11: to Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College station via 49th/50th Streets
* B35: to Brownsville via 39th Street
* B37: to Boerum Hill or Fort Hamilton via Third Avenue
* B63: to Brooklyn Bridge Park or Fort Hamilton via Fifth Avenue
* B70: to Dyker Heights via 39th Street and Eighth Avenue

The area is also home to the Jackie Gleason Bus Depot, renamed in 1988 in honor of the Brooklyn-born actor.

Some traffic from Sunset Park to either Manhattan&#x27;s or Flushing&#x27;s Chinatowns is handled by privately held minibuses or &quot;dollar vans&quot;. These small commuter vans carry passengers between the locales for a fee.

===Subways and railroads===
Several New York City Subway stations are located in Sunset Park. The BMT Fourth Avenue Line has stations at 36th Street (), 45th Street (), 53rd Street (), and 59th Street (). The BMT West End Line () has a station at Ninth Avenue, while the BMT Sea Beach Line () has a station at Eighth Avenue.

Sunset Park also contains a network of waterfront freight railroads. The 65th Street Yard is located at the far south end of Sunset Park, and contains two car float bridges that can load freight rail cars onto car floats to New Jersey. The yard contains connections to two freight lines. It is the terminus of the Bay Ridge Branch, which runs to Queens and the Bronx. There is also a connection to a street-level railway on First Avenue that connects the Brooklyn Army Terminal, Bush Terminal/Industry City, and the subway&#x27;s 36th Street Yard via the South Brooklyn Railway. The First Avenue tracks connect to the First Avenue Yard, a smaller freight yard on First Avenue between 43rd and 51st Streets.

=== Ferry services ===
From 1997 to 2001, SeaStreak service was available at the Brooklyn Army Terminal heading to Pier 11/Wall Street, the East 34th Street Ferry Landing, the Sandy Hook Bay Marina, or Riis Landing on summer Fridays. After subway service in Lower Manhattan was disrupted following 9/11, the city established a free ferry service from the Brooklyn Army Terminal&#x27;s 58th Street Pier to Pier 11/Wall Street, using funds provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. New York Water Taxi took over the route in 2003 and instituted a fare. In 2008, New York Water Taxi established a route between Pier 11 and Breezy Point, Queens, with a stop at Brooklyn Army Terminal. This service was indefinitely suspended in 2010 due to lack of funding.

In the aftermath of subway disruptions arising from Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012, SeaStreak began running a route from Rockaway Park, Queens, to Pier 11 and the East 34th Street ferry terminal. The route was renewed several times through mid-2014, but was discontinued on October 31, 2014, because of a lack of funding. Sunset Park has been served by NYC Ferry&#x27;s South Brooklyn and Rockaway routes since 2017. In January 2020, the New York City Economic Development Corporation announced that NYC Ferry would construct a new stop at 42nd Street near Industry City/Bush Terminal, which would open in 2021.
