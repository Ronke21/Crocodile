<text>Risaralda () is a department of Colombia. It is located in the western central of the country, in the Andean region, It is part of the Coffee axis with Caldas and Quindío. Its capital is Pereira. Risaralda is very well known for the high quality of its coffee, and a booming industry: automotive, clothes, food, trading of goods and services.

It was divided from the department of Caldas in 1966. The territory is very mountainous and has many kinds of climates in a very small area. Its proximity to harbours such as Buenaventura on the Pacific Region and to the biggest cities in Colombia – Bogotá, Cali, Medellín – makes it a fast-growing economic centre.

==Geography==

Risaralda department with an area of , is located in the central sector of the central Andean region west of the country between two major poles of economic development (department of Antioquia in northern and southern Cauca Valley, extending between the central and western Cordillera), which slopes down toward the Río Cauca, also borders the departments of Caldas in the north-east, east Tolima, Quindio Chocó south and west.

The department&#x27;s drainage system consists of two major basins, the Cauca River and the San Juan River. Physiographical formations are covered by the volcanic massifs of the central and western mountain ranges, flat and narrow valleys formed by the natural river basins of the Otún River, the Cauca River, Risaralda River, and La Vieja River.

Its main stages are: Nevado de Santa Isabel (Pereira), Cerro de Tatamá (Sanctuary), Cerro de Caramanta (Mistrató), Alto de las Palomas (Pueblo Rico), Alto de Pelahuevos (APIA), Blade la Serna (Mistrató), San Juan Blade (APIA), Blade of the Content (APIA), Blade Tribune (Pereira), Alto del Nudo and Morro Azul (Pereira), Alto de la Campana (APIA) and the Crystalline High (Belen de Umbria.)

The soils of the department have their origin in igneous rocks and volcanic ash derived from sedimentary rocks and alluvial and colluvial materials. According to these materials, located in the county soil units: manila, Parnaz or 200, unit 10 or Chinchiná and Malabar, being the most extensive in the coffee or Chinchiná unit 10.

As for the classification agrological (crops) 6.4% of the departmental area (except the municipalities of Pueblo Rico, Belén de Umbria Mistrató and have not agrological study) corresponds to classes II, III, and IV, 77.2% to class V, VI, VII, and 16.4% to class VIII and in appearance agrological mainly found Mj units and Fn., which occupy 58.6% of the total area considered suitable for a variety of crops and forests.

In the department there are a variety of life zones, which are distributed as follows: BMH-PM (40.3%), BMH-MB (28.7%), BP-pm (9.4%) and the rest (21.5%) are bs -T-T bh, bh-T, bh-PM, bp-MB, BH-F, bp-M, among others.

==History==

Before the European conquest the territory was inhabited by the Quimbaya and Caramanta people. The first conquistadores arrived in the 1537 expedition headed by Sebastián de Belalcázar.

Some Spanish towns were founded, but the decline of the indigenous population and low immigration of Europeans led to Risaralda sitting largely abandoned until the mid-nineteenth century, when coffee cultivation arrived.

During the colonial and early years of the Republic, the region was subject to Popayán Province. In 1821 it became part of the Cauca Department. In 1857 it became part of the Federal State of Cauca. In 1905, Risaralda was attached to the Caldas Department. In 1966 it was created as a separate department with its capital in Pereira.

<doc id="549724" wikidata="Q235188" url="?curid=549724" title="Sucre Department">
<text>Sucre () is a department in the Caribbean Region of Colombia. The department ranks 27th by area, and it has a population of 904,863, ranking 20th of all the 32 departments of Colombia. Sucre is bordered by the Caribbean on the northwest; by Bolívar Department on the east and by Córdoba Department on the west.

Sucre was named in honor of the Independence hero Antonio José de Sucre who was quoted by the founders of this department in reference to Simón Bolívar&#x27;s death as saying &quot;They have killed my heart&quot;, expression said while cruising the territory of the present day Sucre Department.

As of 2009, the Sucre Department has an estimated population of 802,733, of which 234,886 are in the department capital Sincelejo, according to the DANE projections.

==History==

===Pre-Columbian===
Before the Spanish Conquest, the land comprising the department of Sucre was mainly inhabited by two groups of indigenous people — the Zenú and the Turbacos. The Zenú language was perhaps part of the Chibchan language family by the Arhuacos branch. The Turbaco people were part of the Cariban language family and they controlled the area adjacent to the Gulf of Morrosquillo. The Zenú people — by the Finzenú and Panzenú branches — controlled the rest of the territory, which used to be part of a bigger territory along the current department of Córdoba and parts of Bolívar and Antioquia sometimes known as Zenú kingdom or Zenú nation.

The area adjacent to the coast was inhabited by the Turbaco people and it was the border lands of the Carib&#x27;s territories in the Cariibean Coast of Colombia. This specific part of the Carib&#x27;s included the coasts of the present day departments of Magdalena, Atlántico and Bolívar.

The Zenú engineers were able to develop a complicated hydraulic infrastructure in the basin of the San Jorge river — they also worked in the basin of the Sinú river in lands of the Córdoba Department — involving flood control works as well as drainage and irrigation systems.

===Colonization===

The first Spanish conquerors that sighted to the coastline of the present day Sucre Department were Alonso de Ojeda, Juan de la Cosa, Rodrigo de Bastidas and Francisco Cesar around 1499.

The conquerors thought the territory to be rich in precious metals since, but soon they would find out they were wrong about that. This situation led to the encomenderos to employ the indigenous workforce almost exclusively for cattle rising on the northern areas.

The territory had been under the tutelage of the government settled in Cartagena – except a brief period of time when it was under the jurisdiction of the central government in Bogotá – this control was effective by several denominations while the country evolved from its colonial institutions until its final republican form in 1886 and until the establishment of Sucre as a department independent from Bolivar.

===Modern history===

In 1963, the Second Assembly of Municipalities created the Department of Sucre. People vouched for its creation after a campaign led by CorpoSucre. On July 28, 1966, the Senate of Colombia started a debate on the creation of the department and on August 18 of the same year approved its creation under the 47 Law of 1966 sanctioned by the then-president of Colombia, Carlos Lleras Restrepo.

===Climate===
January through March are dry month of almost no rainfall.

==Demography==
According to the 2018 population census results, 12% of the population self identifies as indigenous people, gathering 5.5% of the national indigenous population; also, 11% of the population self identifies as black, creole, palenquero or afro-colombian. Venezuelans started to arrive to the department in 2016 and now represent almost 3% of the population, according to the official figures in 2022. 

The rest of the population does not declare any ethnicity and are descendants mainly from Spanish, Indigenous and Black people; Arabs started to come in big numbers to Colombia after 1880 and they settled particularly in the Caribbean region of the country, including Sucre, they were mainly Lebanese, Palestinians and Syriacs arrived in smaller numbers, their descendants are estimated to be more than 3 million in the country, their contribution is noticeable in the culture, economy and politics in the Caribbean region. 

As of 2022, the population is getting closer to more than 1 million inhabitants as the national and local population growth is propelled by the massive arrival of Venezuelan migrants. During the 80s and 90s the department had high fertility rates and low death rates, in recent years the growth has slowed down as the fertility rate fell below the replacement level and the demographic transition impacts the department. 

Almost 32% of the entire population resided in the capital city Sincelejo and 62% of the department population lives in urban areas, specially around the capital city where Corozal, Sampues, Morroa and Los Palmitos are placed, gathering almost half a million people, according to the official population projections.

<doc id="549725" wikidata="Q742500" url="?curid=549725" title="Methylmalonic acidemias">
<text>Methylmalonic acidemias, also called methylmalonic acidurias, are a group of inherited metabolic disorders, that prevent the body from properly breaking down proteins and fats. This leads to a buildup of a toxic level of methylmalonic acid in body liquids and tissues. Due to the disturbed branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) metabolism, they are among the &quot;classical&quot; organic acidemias.

Methylmalonic acidemias have varying diagnoses, treatment requirements and prognoses, which are determined by the specific genetic mutation causing the inherited form of the disorder.

The first symptoms may begin as early as the first day of life or as late as adulthood. Symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening. Some forms can result in death if undiagnosed or left untreated.

Methylmalonic acidemias are found with an equal frequency across ethnic boundaries.

==Symptoms and signs==
Depending on the affected gene(s) and mutation, the present symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.
* Acidosis
* Cardiomyopathy
* Coma
* Dehydration
* Developmental delays
* Dysmorphic features
* Encephalopathy, progressive
* Failure to thrive
* Gastrointestinal disease
* Hepatomegaly
* Hyperammonemia
* Hyperglycinemia/ Hyperglycinuria
* Hypoglycemia
* Hypotonia
* Infections, recurrent 
* Ketonemia/ Ketonuria
* Kidney failure
* Lethargy
* Low concentrations of red blood cells, white blood cells and blood platelets
* Memory problems
* Pancreatitis
* Respiratory distress
* Speech delay
* Seizure
* Stroke
* Vomiting
As a rule, methylmalonic acidemias are not apparent at birth as symptoms do not present themselves until proteins are added to the infant&#x27;s diet. Because of this, symptoms typically manifest anytime within the first year of life. However, there are also forms that only develop symptoms in adulthood.

==Cause==
===Genetic===
Methylmalonic acidemias have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene—one from each parent—must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder. The exception is methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cblX type due to variants in &quot;HCFC1&quot; gene, which is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner.

The following are the known genotypes responsible for &quot;isolated methylmalonic acidemias&quot;:
The mut type can further be divided into mut0 and mut- subtypes, with mut0 characterized by a complete lack of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and more severe symptoms and mut- characterized by a decreased amount of mutase activity.

Furthermore, the following genes are also responsible for methylmalonic acidemias:


===Nutritional===
Though not always grouped together with the inherited versions, a severe nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency can also result in syndrome with identical symptoms and treatments as the genetic methylmalonic acidemias. Methylmalonyl-CoA requires vitamin B12 to form succinyl-CoA. When the amount of B12 is insufficient for the conversion of cofactor methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA, the buildup of unused methylmalonyl-CoA eventually leads to methylmalonic acidemia. This diagnosis is often used as an indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency in serum.

== Pathophysiology ==

In methylmalonic acidemias, the body is unable to break down properly:
* essential amino acids: methionine, valine, threonine and isoleucine
* propionic acid from intestinal fermentation
* odd-chain fatty acids
* cholesterol side chain
As a result methylmalonic acid builds up in liquids and tissues. Those afflicted with this disorder are either lacking functional copies or adequate levels of one or more of the following enzymes:
* methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT)
* acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 (ACSF3)
* methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (MCEE)
* enzymes involved in adenosylcobalamin synthesis
These are briefly introduced below:

=== Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase ===

It is estimated that as many as 60% of isolated methylmalonic acidemia cases are the result of a mutated &quot;MMUT&quot; gene which encodes the protein methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. This enzyme is responsible for the digestion of potentially toxic derivatives of the breakdown of the above-mentioned amino acids and fats, primarily cholesterol, particularly this enzyme converts methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA. Without this enzyme, the body has no means to neutralize or remove methylmalonic acid and related compounds. The action of this enzyme can also be crippled by mutations in the &quot;MMAA&quot;, &quot;MMAB&quot;, and &quot;MMADHC&quot; genes, each of which encodes a protein required for normal functioning of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.

=== Acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 ===
CMAMMA is probably the most common form of methylmalonic acidemia, but is rarely diagnosed due to slippage through routine newborn screening, wide symptom variety and, in some cases, symptoms only appearing in adulthood. Mutations of the &quot;ACSF3&quot; gene leads to a deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3, resulting in increased levels of methylmalonic acid and malonic acid. Since the enzyme&#x27;s task is both the conversion of methylmalonic acid into methylmalonyl-CoA, so that it can be fed into the citric acid cycle, and the conversion of malonic acid into malonyl-CoA, which is the first step in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII). CMAMMA can therefore be defined not only as an organic acidemia but also as a defect of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis.

=== Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase ===
Mutations in the &quot;MCEE&quot; gene, which encodes the methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase protein, also referred to as methylmalonyl racemase, will cause a much more mild form of the disorder than the related methylmalonyl-CoA mutase variant. Like the mutase, the epimerase also functions in breaking down the same substances, but to a significantly lesser extent than the mutase does. The phenotypic differences caused by a deficiency of the epimerase as opposed to the mutase are so mild that there is debate within the medical community as to whether or not this genetic deficiency can be considered a disorder or clinical syndrome.

=== Adenosylcobalamin ===
Also known as vitamin B12, this form of cobalamin is a required cofactor of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Even with a functional version of the enzyme at physiologically normal levels, if B12 cannot be converted to this active form (due to defects in the Adenosylcobalamin synthesis system or cobalamin transporters), the mutase will be unable to function.

== Diagnosis ==

=== Newborn Screening ===
Due to the severity and rapidity in which this disorder can cause complications when left undiagnosed, screening for methylmalonic acidemia is often included in the newborn screening exam. For this purpose, a dried blood spot test for the parameter propionylcarnitine (C3) is carried out at the age of 24–48 hours in order to detect isolated methylmalonic acidemias.

Due to normal propionylcarnitine levels and asymptomatic symptoms at the time of testing, the probably most common form of methylmalonic acidemias, CMAMMA, slips through the newborn screening. The autosomal recessive intellectual development disorder 69 also has normal propionylcarnitine levels. Methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cblC type, if mild and with late onset, can also slip through.

=== Routine &amp; biochemical labs ===
Typically, the parameter methylmalonic acid is only tested if propionylcarnitine was previously elevated.

Because of the inability to properly break down amino acids completely, the byproduct of protein digestion, the compound methylmalonic acid, is found in a disproportionate concentration in the blood and urine of those afflicted. These abnormal levels are used as the main diagnostic criteria for diagnosing the disorder. This disorder is typically determined through the use of a urine analysis or blood panel. Elevated levels of ammonia, glycine, and ketone bodies may also be present in the blood and urine.

With the inclusion of the parameter malonic acid, CMAMMA can be quickly differentiated from classic methylmalonic acidemia by calculating the ratio of malonic acid to methylmalonic acid, but only with values from the blood plasma and not from the urine. The ratio can then also be used to determine whether it is CMAMMA (MA&lt;MMA) or malonic aciduria (MA&gt;MMA).

=== Vitamin B12 responsiveness test ===
The test is used for further differential diagnosis and to check the effectiveness of treatment with vitamin B12, the latter can prevent unnecessary injections (of vitamin B12) in children. For better comparability and interpretation of patient reports, Fowler et al have developed a protocol for a standardized vitamin B12 responsiveness test (&quot;in vivo&quot;):

# Metabolically stable and on the same treatment for at least a month. Specify energy and protein intake.
# Stop vitamin B12 at least one month before. If worsening, discontinue and resume administration of vitamin B12.
# For baseline, collect urine from 3 different days. Blood plasma concentrations can also be used if test is sensitive enough.
# Intramuscular injection of 1 mg hydroxocobalamin on 3 consecutive days.
# After injection, collect urine or plasma samples on alternate days for 10 days.
# The urine or plasma samples should be analyzed in the same run by GCMS.
# If the mean urine or plasma concentration of methylmalonic acid decreases by more than 50%, it is vitamin B12 responsive.

Furthermore, vitamin B12 responsiveness can also be tested &quot;in vitro&quot;. It can provide some insights, but it cannot always correctly predict &quot;in vivo&quot; vitamin B12 responsiveness.

=== Molecular genetic testing ===
The final diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic testing if biallelic pathogenic variants are found in the affected gene(s). Due to their high sensitivity, easier accessibility and non-invasiveness, molecular genetic tests replace enzyme assays in most cases. There are specific multigene panels for methylmalonic acidemia, but the particular genes tested may vary from laboratory to laboratory and can be customized by the clinician to the individual phenotype. The molecular genetic methods used in these panels range from sequence analysis, deletion/duplication analysis and other non-sequencing based tests, but in the vast majority of cases the diagnosis is made by sequence analysis.

Furthermore, molecular genetic tests are necessary to check suspected diagnoses and correct misdiagnoses that may have been caused by misleading symptoms and results of the vitamin B12 responsiveness test.

=== Other ===
The presence of methylmalonic acidemia can also be suspected through the use of a CT or MRI scan, however these tests are by no means specific and require clinical and metabolic/correlation.

== Treatment ==

=== Dietary ===
Treatment for all forms of this condition primarily relies on a low-protein diet, and depending on what variant of the disorder the individual suffers from, various dietary supplements. All variants respond to the levo isomer of carnitine as the improper breakdown of the affected substances results in sufferers developing a carnitine deficiency. The carnitine also assists in the removal of acyl-CoA, buildup of which is common in low-protein diets by converting it into acyl-carnitine which can be excreted in urine. Some forms of methylmalonyl acidemia are responsive to cobalamin although cyanocobalamin supplements could prove detrimental to some forms. If the individual proves responsive to both cobalamin and carnitine supplements, then it may be possible for them to ingest substances that include small amounts of the problematic amino acids isoleucine, threonine, methionine, and valine without causing an attack. CblA und cblB versions of methylmalonic acidemia have been found to be cobalamin responsive.

=== Surgical ===
A more extreme treatment includes kidney or liver transplant from a donor without the condition. The foreign organs will produce a functional version of the defective enzymes and digest the methylmalonic acid, however all of the disadvantages of organ transplantation are of course applicable in this situation. There is evidence to suggest that the central nervous system may metabolize methylmalonyl-CoA in a system isolated from the rest of the body. If this is the case, transplantation may not reverse the neurological effects of methylmalonic acid previous to the transplant or prevent further damage to the brain by continued build up.

=== mRNA therapeutics ===
Preclinical proof-of-concept studies in animal models have shown that mRNA therapy is also suitable for rare metabolic diseases, including isolated methylmalonic acidemia. In this context, the mut methylmalonic acidemia therapy candidate &quot;mRNA-3705&quot; from the biotechnology company Moderna, which is currently in phase 1/2, is worth mentioning.

=== Small molecular therapeutics ===
The investigational small molecular therapeutic &quot;HST5040&quot; from HemoShear Therapeutics for methylmalonic aciduria and propionic aciduria, which is currently in phase 2, should be mentioned here. Taken daily orally or by gastric tube, it is designed to prevent toxic accumulation of propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA or their derivatives by shunting CoA away from the propionyl-CoA pathway, leading to normal or near-normal levels of these metabolites and potentially improving metabolic state and energy-producing pathways. 

Another small molecule therapeutic in development is &quot;BBP-671&quot; from BridgeBio Pharma for pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), propionic and methylmalonic acidemia, which is currently in phase 1. By allosterically activating pantothenate kinases, &quot;BBP-671&quot; is expected to increase the production of CoA from vitamin B5 and thus normalize metabolic processes.

== Prognosis ==
Though there are not distinct stages of the disease, methylmalonic acidemia is a progressive condition; the symptoms of this disorder are compounded as the concentration of methylmalonic acid increases. If the triggering proteins and fats are not removed from the diet, this buildup can lead to irreparable kidney or liver damage and eventually death.

The prognosis will vary depending on the severity of the condition and the individual&#x27;s response to treatment. Prognosis is typically better for those with cobalamin-responsive variants and not promising in those suffering from noncobalamin-responsive variants. Milder variants have a higher frequency of appearance in the population than the more severe ones. Even with dietary modification and continued medical care, it may not be possible to prevent neurological damage in those with a nonresponsive acidemia. Without proper treatment or diagnosis, it is not uncommon for the first acidemic attack to be fatal.

Despite these challenges, since it was first identified in 1967, treatment and understanding of the condition has improved to the point where it is not unheard of for even those with unresponsive forms of methylmalonic acidemia to be able to reach adulthood and even carry and deliver children safely.

== Research ==
===Nosologic history===
The first methylmalonic acidemia was characterized by Oberholzer et al. in 1967.

=== Neurologic effects ===
That methylmalonic acid can have disastrous effects on the nervous system has been long reported; however, the mechanism by which this occurs has never been determined. Published in 2015, research performed on the effects of methylmalonic acid on neurons isolated from fetal rats in an in vitro setting using a control group of neurons treated with an alternate acid of similar pH. These tests have suggested that methylmalonic acid causes decreases in cellular size and increase in the rate of cellular apoptosis in a concentration dependent manner with more extreme effects being seen at higher concentrations. Furthermore, micro-array analysis of these treated neurons have also suggested that on an epigenetic-level methylmalonic acid alters the transcription rate of 564 genes, notably including those involved in the apoptosis, p53, and MAPK signaling pathways.

=== Mitochondrial dysfunction ===
As the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA takes place inside the mitochondria, mitochondrial dysfunction as a result of diminished electron transport chain function has long been suspected as a feature in methylmalonic acidemias. Recent research has found that in rat models mitochondria of rats affected by the disorder grow to unusual size, dubbed megamitochondria. These megamitochondria also appear to have deformed internal structures and a loss in electron richness in their matrix. These megamitochondria also showed signs of decreased respiratory chain function, particularly in respiratory complex IV which only functioned at about 50% efficiency. Similar changes were identified in the mitochondria of a liver sample removed during transplant from a 5-year-old boy suffering from methylmalonic acidemia mut type.

=== Benign mut phenotype ===
Case studies in several patients presenting nonresponsive mut0 methylmalonic acidemia with a specific mutation designated p.P86L have suggested the possibility of further subdivision in mut type methylmalonic acidemia might exist. Though currently unclear if this is due to the specific mutation or early detection and treatment, despite complete nonresponse to cobalamin supplements, these individuals appeared to develop a largely benign and near completely asymptomatic version of methylmalonic acidemia. Despite consistently showing elevated methylmalonic acid in the blood and urine, these individuals appeared for the large part developmentally normal.

== Notable cases ==
* Ryan Stallings, a St. Louis infant, was mistakenly diagnosed with ethylene glycol poisoning instead of methylmalonic acidemia in 1989, leading to a wrongful murder conviction and life sentence for his mother, Patricia Stallings.

<doc id="549733" wikidata="Q13990" url="?curid=549733" title="Valle del Cauca Department">
<text>Valle del Cauca, or Cauca Valley (), is a department in western Colombia abutting the Pacific Ocean. Its capital is Santiago de Cali. Other cities such as Buenaventura, Buga, Cartago, Palmira and Tuluá have great economical, political, social and cultural influence on the department&#x27;s life. Valle del Cauca has the largest number of independent (i.e., nonmetropolitan) towns with over 100,000 inhabitants in the country, counting six within its borders. Buenaventura has the largest and busiest seaport in Colombia, moving about 8,500,000 tons of merchandise annually.

==Geography==

The department of Valle del Cauca is located in the western part of the country, between 3° 5′ N and 5° 1′ N latitude and 75° 42′ W and 77° 33′ W longitude. It borders the departments of Risaralda and Quindío to the north, Cauca to the south, Tolima to the east, and Chocó and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The valley is geographically bounded by the Cordillera Central and Occidental and is watered by numerous rivers that empty into the Cauca River. The department is divided into four zones: the Pacific Fringe, which is humid and mostly jungle; the western mountain range, also humid and full of jungle, heavily deforested because of the paper industry; the Andean valley of the Cauca River, whose surrounding lands are the most fertile in the country; and the western ridge of the Cordillera Central. Valle del Cauca also administers Malpelo Island in the Pacific.

==History==

===Prehistory===

====Hunter-gatherer societies====
Palynological analyses performed by experts have determined that during the Superior Pleistocene some 40,000–10,500 years ago, the valleys of El Dorado and Alto Calima had Andean forests and sub-Andean vegetation. The discovery of projectiles indicated that there were communities of hunter-gatherers at the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene. The extinction of the Pleistocenic megafauna in the beginning of the Holocene forced humans to adapt to their new environment, becoming hunter-gatherers. In the lower basin of the Calima River (Sauzalito River, El Recreo River, and El Pital River), archaeologists found the oldest traces of hunter-gatherers who inhabited the Valley of the Cauca River. According to these, in 5000 BC these societies already had some level of primitive agriculture and cultivated maize. There is little information about the years between 3000 and 1500 BC.

====Ancient agricultural–pottery societies (1500 BC – 600 AD)====
In 1500 BC the first agricultural–pottery society, the Ilama culture, appeared, extending along the Calima River (in what is now the towns of Restrepo and Darién). Its society had a social structure of &quot;cacicazgos&quot; (&quot;chiefdoms&quot;) that prevailed until the arrival of the Spaniards. The Ilama economy was based on migratory agriculture using maize, yuca, and beans; hunting; fishing; textile manufacturing; and metallurgy. The chief or &quot;cacique&quot; was the head of the settlement and had &quot;chamanes&quot; (&quot;spiritual leaders&quot;), warriors, farmers, hunters, pottery men, and goldsmiths. By 100 AD, the Ilama had developed into the Yotoco, whom expanded the region of the Ilama further, down the Cauca River to the Pacific Ocean, and southward to the present-day region of Santiago de Cali (Cali).

The Yotoco were a highly stratified society, headed by &quot;caciques&quot;, who managed several settlements. They existed in the region until around 1200 AD. A rising population forced them to develop effective agricultural systems to meet food demand, which improved pottery and metalworking techniques. Yotoco agriculture — based on maize, yuca, beans, arracacha, and achiote, among other foods - was more diverse than that of the Ilama. The Yotoco experienced a decline beginning in the 6th century AD.

====Pre-Columbian agricultural–pottery societies (600–1600)====
This archeological period is called the Late Period and is divided into Late Period I (6th to 13th centuries) and Late Period II (14th to 16th centuries). In Late Period I the Valle del Cauca region was inhabited by the early Sonso culture, Bolo, Sachamate, and La Llanada. During Late Period II the region was inhabited by the late Sonso culture, Pichinde, Buga, and Quebrada Seca. Their development is attributed to population growth. Almost all the settlers in the area became subject to the rule of one main &quot;cacique&quot;.

===Arrival of the Spanish and conquest===

The first 67 Spanish explorers arrived in the area after founding the village of Popayán, in an expedition from Quito headed by Sebastián de Belalcázar. In the Valle del Cauca the explorers founded the village of Villa de Ampudia, named after one of them, Juan de Ampudia. By orders of Belalcázar the village was then moved to the Riviera of the Cauca River, within the Gorrones indigenous people&#x27;s territory. In 1536, a Captain Muñoz ordered the city to be moved to the Valley, where the Village of Cali was founded on 25 July of that same year. Another Spanish explorer, , coming from the village of Cartagena de Indias, entered Cali on 23 December 1538 with a second group of explorers, but he returned to Cartagena, leaving many of his men behind including Pedro Cieza de León. A third group of explorers, led by Admiral Jorge Robledo under orders of , advanced to the North of the Valle del Cauca and founded the villages of Anserma (now part of Caldas Department; 15 August 1539), Cartago (9 August 1540), and Antioquia (25 November 1541), and under command of Pascual de Andagoya who came from Panama to Cali with a fourth group of explorers.

===Department of Valle del Cauca===
 The Department of Valle del Cauca was created by decree number 340 on April 16, 1910, which created 12 other departments in Colombia. The Valle del Cauca Department was a result of the union of four former departments: Cartago, Buga, and Cali.

==Government==
The government of Valle del Cauca is similar to the central government of Colombia, which has three branches of power: executive, legislative, and judicial, along with various &quot;control agencies&quot; with oversight capacity. The executive branch in Valle del Cauca is represented by the governor, the legislative branch is represented by the department assembly and its deputies, and the judicial branch is represented by four department-wide court systems: the Superior Tribunal of Cali, the Penal Court of the Circuit of Cali, the Administrative Tribunal of Valle del Cauca, and the Superior Military Tribunal for military cases. Valle del Cauca has 42 municipalities, each with a mayor, who is a popularly elected representative of the governor.

==Economy==

Valle del Cauca has a diversified economy. Its valley contains sugarcane, cotton, soy, and sorghum crops, and there are coffee crops in the mountains. The department is known for its sugar industry, which provides sugar to the markets of the rest of the country and nearby countries. The sugar is obtained from the large sugar cane plantations, which were introduced to the department by Sebastián de Belalcázar. The production by the city of Yumbo also stands out, where several companies are found, most prominently the paper and cement businesses. The port at Buenaventura is Colombia&#x27;s main port on the Pacific coast, allowing for the import and export of goods, and is of great importance for the economy of both the department and the country.

==Demographics==

More than 80% of the population lives in cities or towns. The coverage of public services is among the highest in the country, with electrical power and education standing out the most.

===Population===

The capital of the department is Santiago de Cali, with approximately 2,800,000 inhabitants. It is made up of 42 municipalities, the most populous being, from north to south, Cartago (famous for its craftsmanship, embroidery, and the &quot;Casa del Virrey&quot;, &quot;House of the Viceroy&quot;), Roldanillo (location of the museum containing works by the artist Omar Rayo), Tuluá (located in the center of the department), Yumbo (an industrial center with more than 2,000 industries), Ginebra, Palmira, Buga, and Jamundí.

The population of nonmetropolitan towns with over 100,000 inhabitants is as follows (capital in italics):
==Culture==

===Architecture===

The Cauca Valley was historically a place dedicated to cattle and agricultural activities. For this reason, the region has not developed an artistic and European-influenced architectural style, as the relative near city of Popayán, located in the department of Cauca; instead, the department generates simple and pragmatic constructions, with a few exceptions. The material of the colonial constructions was basically of wood and bricks, with some use of stones.

===Cuisine===

The food most closely associated with the department is &quot;sancocho de gallina&quot;, a stew made with an old hen, potatoes, yucca, corn, and other ingredients; the characteristic flavor comes from a herb called &quot;cimarrón&quot; or &quot;recao&quot; (&quot;Eryngium foetidum&quot;).

<text>Vaupés () is a department of Southeastern Colombia in the jungle covered Amazonía Region. It is located in the southeast part of the country, bordering Brazil to the east, the department of Amazonas to the south, Caquetá to the west, and Guaviare, and Guainía to the north; covering a total area of 54,135 km2. Its capital is the town of Mitú. As of 2018, the population was 40,797, making it the least populous department in Colombia.

== History ==

During the colonization by the Spanish and first days of the first republic, the territory of Vaupes was part of the Province of Popayán, during the Greater Colombia. After the independence from Spain between 1821 and 1830 became part of the first version of the Boyacá Department. Between 1831 and 1857 the territory became part of the National Territory of Caquetá to later be part of the Sovereign State of Cauca. In 1886 became part of the then recently created Cauca Department.

With the expansion of the rubber industry and the industrial revolution, exploration for rubber reached the area bringing colonizers that altered and in some cases extinguished the majority of the indigenous population.

The territory was first made into a territorial division in 1910 and functioned as Commissaries (Comisarias) with the town of Calamar as capital (located in present-day Guaviare) but later moved to the town of Mitú to make an &quot;act of presence&quot; near the border with Brazil. In 1963 Guainía segregated from the Vaupes and became a commissary. In 1977, Guaviare followed the same path.

The department was created after the Colombian Constitution of 1991 which established it as a Department of Colombia on July 4, 1991.

== Economy ==

The department&#x27;s main economic activities feature logging and fishing, with much exportation to neighboring Brazil.

== Demographics ==
The vast majority of the population consists of indigenous inhabitants. It is the least populated department in the country.
== Transportation ==
Because of its location in the Amazon jungle, it has no roads connecting it with the rest of the country or internally from settlement to settlement, and commerce and contact with the outside world is achieved through travel along the main rivers and by means of air travel. Several of the small settlements have airstrips with service to the department&#x27;s capital, Mitú, and from there with the rest of the country.

== Administrative divisions ==
Because of its small population and vast extension of land, Vaupés only has three municipalities. Other sections of the department were classified as special types of corregimientos, which has certain hybrid functions from a municipality and corregimiento.

<doc id="549736" wikidata="Q268729" url="?curid=549736" title="Vichada Department">
<text>Vichada Department (, ) is a department of the Republic of Colombia in South America. Vichada is located in the eastern plains of Colombia, in the Orinoquía Region within the Orinoco river basin bordering the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the north and east. To the north the department also borders with Arauca Department, to the northwest with Casanare Department, to the west with Meta Department, to the southwest narrowly bordering with Guaviare Department and to the south with Guainía Department. The department is the second largest in Colombia and scarcely populated in comparison to other departments.

The department was previously a commissary established in 1913.

The largest town and capital of the department is Puerto Carreño located in extreme northeastern part of the department and bordering Venezuela. the department is subdivided into four municipalities; Puerto Carreño, La Primavera, Santa Rosalía and Cumaribo. It also contains 46 indigenous reserves and 6 communities.

==Geography==

The department is located on the eastern plains of Colombia known as the Llanos. The department limits to the north with the Arauca Department and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; to the east with Venezuela; to the south with the Guainía Department and Guaviare Department; and to the west with Meta Department and Casanare Department.

The department is located to the left margin of the Orinoco river and the right margin of the Meta River within the plains of los Llanos. Part of the department lies on the Guiana Shield. Soil lacks sediments due to the lack of alluvions from rivers coming from the Andes mountains.

Climate in the department is predominantly hot and humid with an average temperature of throughout the year.

The department also contains a major impact crater, the Vichada Structure.

==History==
In 1913 the government of Colombia created the commissary of Vichada and the capital was established in a locality known as &quot;El Picacho&quot; between the Meta and Orinoco rivers. The town was named Puerto Carreño in honor of Pedro María Carreño, then acting Minister of Government.

In August 1974, Puerto Carreño was elevated to the category of municipality by decree 1594 of that same year.

On 5 July 1991 Vichada was elevated to the category of department and Puerto Carreño as its capital.

<text>One Lie Fits All is the third studio album by British metal band One Minute Silence, released on 7 July 2003. Produced by John Leckie, it was the band&#x27;s last album before they announced their break-up in October 2003, and never enjoyed a supporting tour unlike the two EPs (&quot;Revolution&quot; and &quot;We Bounce&quot;) that were released during the anticipation for the album.

MusicOMH wrote that the album&#x27;s production style ranked with the best nu metal albums, but that the songs included some weaker material.

== Performance ==
The album gave One Minute Silence their highest-charting single to date with &quot;I Wear My Skin&quot; reaching number 44 in the UK charts.

<doc id="549740" wikidata="Q26855" url="?curid=549740" title="Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina">
<text>The Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina (, ), or San Andrés and Providencia, is one of the departments of Colombia, and the only one located geographically in Central America. It consists of two island groups in the Caribbean Sea about northwest of mainland Colombia, and eight outlying banks and reefs. The largest island of the archipelago and Colombia is called San Andrés and its capital is San Andrés. The other large islands are Providencia and Santa Catalina Islands which lie to the north-east of San Andrés; their capital is Santa Isabel.

==Name==
The name is sometimes abbreviated to &quot;Archip. de San Andres&quot;. The official website abbreviates it as San Andrés (&quot;Gobernación de San Andrés&quot;). ISO 3166-2:CO lists it as &quot;San Andrés, Providencia y Santa Catalina&quot;. Statoids lists it as &quot;San Andrés y Providencia&quot;.

==History==
Spain formally claimed the archipelago of San Andres and Providencia in 1510, a few years after the voyages of Christopher Columbus. In 1544, the territory was placed under the administration of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. During the early years, Spain concentrated on exploring and colonizing the mainland and hardly settled the islands.

In 1630, English Puritans arrived in Providence Island, under the aegis of the Providence Island Company. The Puritans decided to settle the tropical islands, rather than cold, rocky New England, but the Providence Island colony did not succeed in the same way as the Massachusetts Bay Colony. They established slave-worked plantations and engaged in privateering, which led to the Spanish and Portuguese conquering the colony in May, 1641. In 1670, English buccaneers, led by Henry Morgan, took over the islands, which he used as a base to attack Panama. The buccaneers abandoned the islands by 1672. There is no record of anyone inhabiting the islands from then for another century.

In 1775, Lieutenant Tomás O&#x27;Neil, a Spaniard of Irish descent, was given military command of the islands and, in 1790, was named governor. He requested the transfer of the islands to the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of New Granada, which was granted in 1803. That year, Spain assigned the islands, together with the province of Veraguas (western Panama and the east coast of Nicaragua), to the Viceroyalty of New Granada. The territory was administered from the province of Cartagena. Soon, trade links with Cartagena were greater than those with Guatemala.

On 4 July 1818, a French corsair, Louis-Michel Aury, with 400 men and 14 ships flying the Argentine flag, captured Old Providence and St. Catherine islands. The island was populated by white English-speaking Protestants and their slaves. Aury and his team used the islands as their new base from which to pursue Central American independence. However, his efforts to also support Bolivar in his fight for Venezuelan and Colombian independence were repeatedly turned down.

After the Spanish colonies became independent, the inhabitants of San Andrés, Providence and St. Catherine voluntarily adhered to the Republic of Gran Colombia in 1822, which placed them under the administration of the Magdalena Department. The First Mexican Empire, which was succeeded by the United Provinces of Central America (UPCA), also claimed the islands. Gran Colombia, in turn, protested the UPCA&#x27;s occupation of the eastern coast of Nicaragua. The UPCA broke up in 1838 to 1840, but Nicaragua carried on the dispute, as did Gran Colombia&#x27;s successors: New Granada and Colombia. A local administration (&quot;intendencia&quot;) was established in the islands in 1912 by Colombia.

In 1928, Colombia and Nicaragua signed the Esguerra-Bárcenas Treaty, which gave control of the islands to Colombia. However, when the Sandinista government assumed power in the 1980s, Nicaragua repudiated the treaty. Colombia argues that the treaty&#x27;s final ratification in 1930 (when the US forces were already on their way out) confirms its validity. Colombia and Honduras signed a maritime boundary treaty in 1999, which implicitly accepts Colombian sovereignty over the islands.

In 2001, Nicaragua filed claims with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over the disputed maritime boundary and claimed in the Caribbean, including the San Andrés and Providencia Archipelagoes. Colombia responded that the court has no jurisdiction over the matter and increased its naval and police presence in the islands. Colombia also defended its claim in the ICJ. On 13 December 2007, the ICJ ruled that the islands were Colombian territory but left the maritime border dispute unresolved. On 19 November 2012, the ICJ upheld that Colombia had sovereignty over the islands.

=== United States claims ===
In the 19th century, the United States claimed several uninhabited locations in the area under the Guano Island Act, including several now claimed by Colombia. In 1981, the US ceded its claims to Serrana Bank and Roncador Bank to Colombia and abandoned its claim to Quita Sueño Bank. The US still maintains claims over Serranilla Bank and Bajo Nuevo Bank and considers them both to be unincorporated territories of the United States.

=== Declaration of self-determination ===

In 1903, the local Raizal population rejected an offer from the US to separate from Colombia in the wake of Panama&#x27;s secession from Colombia. However, the island&#x27;s native population soon changed its mind when the policies of successive Colombian governments tried consistently to modify the majority Raizal and British ethnic composition of the Islands by the extensive migration of Spanish-speaking mainland Colombians. The efforts at assimilation and immigration were led largely by Catholic missionaries, which angered the Protestant native population.

== Local government and representation ==
=== 2007 elections ===
A member of the departmental assembly for 15 years, Pedro Gallardo Forbes, of the Regional Integration Movement (MIR), won the 28 October 2007 gubernatorial election, with support from the Colombian Conservative Party and the Radical Change party. He succeeded a governor from the Colombian Liberal Party. He got 8,187 votes (38.93%), Aury Guerrero Bowie (Liberal Party, with support from the Democratic Colombia Party) 8,160 votes (38.8%), and Jack Housni Jaller (Social National Unity Party) 4,063 votes (19.3%). Only 21,991 out of 41,197 potential electors voted in the gubernatorial election.

At the departmental assembly, elected the same day, the 9 seats were distributed among 6 parties: three Liberals (Arlington Howard, Qwincy Bowie Gordon, and Leroy Carol Bent Archbold), two MIR (Jorge Méndez and Freddy Herazo) two Democratic Colombia Party (former MP María Teresa Uribe Bent and former Interior Secretary Rafael Gómez Redondo), two SNUP (Fernando Cañon Florez and María Said Darwich), one Radical Change (Heber Esquivel Benitez), and one Conservative (Julio César Gallardo Martínez).

The new mayor of Providence, Janeth Archbold (Team Colombia party), a political ally of the new governor, was elected with 1,013 votes against Liberal Mark Taylor (515 votes), SNUP Arturo Robinson (514 votes) and Conservative Peter Bent.

== Geography ==
Besides the San Andrés and Providencia island groups, there are eight atolls that belong to the department, including submerged Alice Shoal.

=== Island of San Andrés ===

==== San Andrés Island ====

This is the main island of the San Andrés group, and the largest of the department. It is located at . It measures in length with a width of and covers an area of . There is a tiny lagoon in the centre of the island called Big Pond. The principal town is San Andrés in the north of the island. Another town is San Luis on the east coast. &quot;Cayo Johnny&quot; (Johnny Caye) lies ENE of German Point (Punta Norte), the island&#x27;s northern tip, and Haynes Cay about the same distance east of the island. Cotton Cay is less than south of San Andrés town, on the northeastern coast.

==== Cayos de Albuquerque (Cayos de S.W., Southwest Cays) ====

This atoll is southwest of San Andrés at . It is the westernmost point of Colombia. The reef is about across. In the southern part are Cayo del Norte and Cayo del Sur. Cayo del Norte, the larger of the two, is up to high and overgrown with palm trees and bushes. Cayo del Sur, a few hundred metres further South, reaches a height of a little more than and is vegetated with a few bushes, and in the South with mangroves. There is a lighthouse on Cayo del Norte, at , operating since 1980. It is maintained by the Colombian Navy.

==== Cayos del Este Sudeste (Courtown Cays, Cayos de E.S.E.) ====

This atoll is east-south-east of San Andrés Island and northeast of Cayos de Alburquerque, at . It is long and wide. There are a few sand cays in the southeast. The largest ones are Cayo del Este, Cayo Bolivar, West Cay, and Cayo Arena, none of which are higher than . All cays are overgrown with palm trees and bushes, and surrounded by mangroves. There is a Colombian Navy lighthouse on Cayo Bolivar. The cays are regularly visited by fishermen from the Colombian mainland and San Andrés. There are two concrete buildings on Cayo Bolivar, and a few wooden huts on the other cays.

==== Banks and shoals ====
Colombia claims sovereignty over six additional outlying banks and shoals: Alice Shoal, Bajo Nuevo Bank, Serranilla Bank, Quita Sueño Bank, Serrana Bank, and Roncador Bank.

== Demographics ==
The Departamento de San Andrés, Providencia y Santa Catalina covers a land area of and had a census population of 59,573. The latest official estimate for 2007 is 72,923.

Before 1960, the population of the islands was almost entirely Raizals, who are an Afro-Caribbean group, Protestant in religion, speaking San Andrés–Providencia Creole. There is a minority of white English-speaking Protestants of British descent. Colombia has promoted the migration of Spanish-speaking mainlanders, with Catholic missions participating since 1947. This policy seems to be an answer to growing discontent within the Raizal community that could strengthen separatist movements; a Raizal majority would in this case win a pro-independence referendum but this could be neutralized by outnumbering them with mainland Colombians.

By 2005, Raizals were only 30% of the 60,000 or more inhabitants of the islands, with the rest being mainland Colombians and English-speaking whites of British descent. Most Raizals are multilingual and can speak Spanish, Creole, and English.

==Transportation==

===Airports===
Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport (IATA: ADZ) serves the towns of San Andrés and San Luis, but also commercially serves the nearby island of Providencia Island through feeder flights from El Embrujo Airport.
Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport was initially called Sesquicentenario International Airport. It is the 6th busiest airport in Colombia, handling 836,234 passengers in 2006. Most of these passengers come from the continental part of the country, due to poor international direct service to the island. Many international tourists have to fly to one of Colombia&#x27;s largest airports to be able to reach the islands. Copa Airlines maintains a passenger service between San Andrés and Panama City. In 2021, American Airlines began serving San Andrés nonstop from Miami. In recent years, San Andrés has also received seasonal charter flights, mainly from Canada and a few Central American countries.

The airport is one of Colombia&#x27;s fastest growing airports with a 13.4% increase in the number of passengers between 2005 and 2006.

<text>Gilera is an Italian motorcycle manufacturer founded in Arcore in 1909 by Giuseppe Gilera (1887–1971). In 1969, the company was purchased by Piaggio.

==History==
Giuseppe Gilera founded his self-named motorcycle company in 1909 (aged 22) near Milan, Italy. His first model used a 317cc single-cylinder overhead-valve engine (67x90mm bore/stroke) with a single-speed belt drive in a simple open frame with the engine as a stressed member of the frame, and no suspension. It produced 7 hp, weighed 75 kg, and had a top speed of 105 km/h (65 mph).

Gilera subsequently produced a series of V-twins and single-cylinder models with sidevalve, F-head, and overhead-valve configurations. After WW1, the factory was moved to Arcore, between Milan and Lecco, very near the Monza racing circuit. Racing was always a focus for the brand, with Giusseppe&#x27;s brother Luigi a successful ISDT participant in the early 1930s. 

After withdrawing from competition in 1957, Gilera changed direction abruptly. They downplayed their hitherto successful line of four-stroke singles and began to focus on motocross and off-road events in association with independent specialist Elmeca. Sales declined through the 1960s and by 1968 the company was in receivership.

In 1969, Gilera became part of the Piaggio group. In 1992, Gilera made a return to the Grand Prix arena and Piaggio continues to produce small-displacement motorcycles with the Gilera name. The famous factory of Arcore was closed in 1993 and now the motorcycles (only scooters) bearing the name Gilera are produced by Piaggio in Pontedera.

==Racing history==
In 1935, Gilera acquired rights to the CNA Rondine. It had double-over-head camshafts, forced-inducting supercharger and was water-cooled, producing @9000 and had a top speed of . This formed the basis for Gilera&#x27; s racing machines for nearly forty years. From the mid-thirties, Gilera developed a range of four-stroke engine machines. The engines ranged from 100 to 500 cc, the most famous being the 1939 Saturno. Designed by Giuseppe Salmaggi, the Saturno was inspired by the pre-war Gilera VTEGS 500 cc “Otto Bulloni” yet was quite different due to its unit construction.

After World War II, Gilera dominated Grand Prix motorcycle racing, winning the 500 cc road racing world championship six times in eight years. Facing a downturn in motorcycle sales due to the increase in the popularity of automobiles after the war, Gilera made a gentleman&#x27;s agreement with the other Italian motorcycle makers to quit Grand Prix racing after the 1957 season as a cost-cutting measure.

The 1957 500 cc machines on which former World Champion rider Geoff Duke had much success were resurrected in 1963, but with the benefit of newer, upgraded Tyre technology of the 1960s were considered still competitive. The team was devised by Duke to challenge the domination of Mike Hailwood on the MV and had early successes with riders Derek Minter and teammate John Hartle at Silverstone, Brands Hatch and Imola, Italy.

In May 1963 Minter suffered serious injuries when racing a Norton at Brands Hatch, and his place in the team for the TT races was taken by Phil Read, who came third to second-place teammate Hartle. The team only raced for one season in selected races.

In 1966 Minter arranged to ride the Gileras at the TT in June, again without success as he crashed on a wet road surface after a rain shower at Brandish Corner during the last practice before race-week, breaking his left wrist which ended his racing for the rest of the race season. The bikes were raced at Brands Hatch later in the year.
The four-cylinder Gilera engine was also used successfully for world championship sidecar races. Eight victories in the sidecar class, as well as four runners-up in the world championship from 1949 to 1952 (three times Ercole Frigerio and one Albino Milani), showed the potential of the engine. In 1954, the Gilera four-cylinder was used by Piero Taruffi for the record-breaking T vehicle. The Swiss driver Florian Camathias won a sidecar race with a Gilera four-cylinder engine for the last time in 1964.

<doc id="549742" wikidata="Q1170190" url="?curid=549742" title="Verdet constant">
<text>The Verdet constant is an optical property named after the French physicist Émile Verdet. It describes the strength of the Faraday effect for a particular material. For a constant magnetic field parallel to the path of the light, it can be calculated as

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the angle between the starting and ending polarizations, formula_3 is the Verdet constant, formula_4 is the strength of the magnetic flux density, and formula_5 is the path length in the material.

The Verdet constant of a material is wavelength-dependent and for most materials is extremely small. It is strongest in substances containing paramagnetic ions such as terbium. The highest Verdet constants in bulk media are found in terbium-doped dense flint glasses or in crystals of terbium gallium garnet (TGG). These materials have excellent transparency properties and high damage thresholds for laser radiation. Atomic vapours, however, can have Verdet constants which are orders of magnitude larger than TGG, but only over a very narrow wavelength range. Alkali vapours can therefore be used as an optical isolator or as an extremely sensitive magnetometer.

The Faraday effect is chromatic (i.e. it depends on wavelength), and therefore the Verdet constant is quite a strong function of wavelength. At 632.8 nm, the Verdet constant for TGG is reported to be , whereas at 1064 nm it falls to . This behavior means that the devices manufactured with a certain degree of rotation at one wavelength will produce much less rotation at longer wavelengths. Many Faraday rotators and isolators are adjustable by varying the degree to which the active TGG rod is inserted into the magnetic field of the device. In this way, the device can be tuned for use with a range of lasers within the design range of the device. Truly broadband sources (such as ultrashort-pulse lasers and the tunable vibronic lasers) will not see the same rotation across the whole wavelength band.

<doc id="549744" wikidata="Q5030766" url="?curid=549744" title="Canadian federal budget">
<text>In Canada, federal budgets are presented annually by the Government of Canada to identify planned government spending and expected government revenue, and to forecast economic conditions for the upcoming year. They are usually released in February or March, before the start of the fiscal year.

All the Canadian provinces also present budgets. Since provincial finances depend on funds from the federal government, they are usually released after the federal budget.

== Budget process ==
The budget is announced in the House of Commons by the Minister of Finance, who traditionally wears new shoes while doing so. The Budget is then voted on by the House of Commons. Budgets are a confidence measure, and if the House votes against it the government can fall, as happened to Prime Minister Joe Clark&#x27;s government in 1980. The governing party strictly enforces party discipline, usually expelling from the party caucus any government Member of Parliament (MP) who votes against the budget. Opposition parties almost always vote against the budget. In cases of minority government, the government has normally had to include major concessions to one of the smaller parties to ensure passage of the budget.

Historically the official opposition used to prepare a complete alternative budget and present this alternative to the Canadian people along with the main budget. In recent years, opposition parties are more likely to pick only certain aspects to criticize. The Reform Party revived this practice for a time, however. A complete alternative budget is today produced each year by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a non-partisan think-tank.

Traditionally, the budget process was immensely secretive with little consultation. Under Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, the Finance Minister famously would type the entire budget himself so that no secretary could read it. This secrecy was felt to be needed for inside information could enable individuals to profit from upcoming government decisions. The secrecy also had a large political component, as it would help undermine the response by the opposition.

Under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and his Finance Minister Paul Martin, this changed considerably. Most of the budget would be released well before its announcement, especially any major changes so as to get feedback from the populace and the market.

The process of creating the budget is a complex one which begins within the working ranks for the Federal Government. Each year, the various departments that make up the Government (for example, Health, Transportation, Foreign Affairs, National Defence, Industry, CRA, etc.) submit what are called &#x27;The Main Estimates&#x27; to The Treasury Board Secretariat. These documents identify the planned expenditure of each department, linking these proposed expenses to programs, to objectives and ultimately to the priorities of the current ruling Government. The Treasury Board Secretariat combines these budget estimates and compiles an initial proposed budget. From there, the Cabinet and Prime Minister&#x27;s Office adjust the budget based on a series of economic, social and political factors. In reality, decisions are usually made with the primary intent of re-election and so often include advantages for key regions and lobby groups.

Following the budget, Parliament (the Canadian Parliament) will pass an Appropriation Act (called the &#x27;Interim Supply&#x27;) which will allow individual departments to spend 3/12th of their annual budget. (The Government of Canada Fiscal Year runs from April 1 to March 31.) This partial authority enables Parliament to spend more time in examining the Estimates documents. In June, Parliament appropriates the full supply.

<text>The Cuban gambusia, spotted gambusia or blue gambusia (Gambusia punctata) is a species of freshwater fish. It is a member of the family Poeciliidae of order Cyprinodontiformes, and is the type species of its genus. It is native to Cuba, inhabiting lakes, ponds and streams, including mountain streams. A carnivorous surface feeder, it occurs in shoals near the shoreline. It be found in estuarine habitat.

This species has the terminal, upward-facing mouth typical of surface feeders, and a protruding belly. It has four or five rows of darkly spotted scales, possibly forming a dark lateral stripe in the case of the midline row. The dorsal and caudal fins are typically partially spotted. Males reach a maximum standard length (SL) of around 4.8 cm, with females reaching about 7.0 cm. Record SL for this species is 10 cm.

&quot;Gambusia punctata&quot; is part of a species complex including &quot;G. rhizophorae&quot;, &quot;G. xanthosoma&quot;, &quot;G. beebei&quot; and &quot;G. pseudopunctata&quot;. Additional cryptic species have been proposed to exist within the range of &quot;G. punctata&quot; on the basis of mitochondrial haplogroup data.

<text>1876 is the third historical novel in Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;Narratives of Empire&quot; series. It was published in 1976 and details the events of a year described by Vidal as &quot;probably the low point in our republic&#x27;s history&quot;.

==Style==

The novel is written in the form of a journal written by Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler.

==Plot==
The novel follows Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler who has recently returned to the United States after more than 30 years in Europe, where he married into minor Napoleonic nobility; he is accompanied by his beautiful, young, widowed daughter Emma, the Princesse d&#x27;Agrigente. She immediately becomes the darling of New York high society. Despite his fame and affluent image, Schuyler finds work as a journalist because his wealth has been destroyed by the Panic of 1873 and his daughter&#x27;s late husband has left her penniless. Schuyler also supports the Democratic candidate, Samuel J. Tilden, Governor of New York, because he hopes to secure himself a diplomatic position with the incoming administration, enabling him to return to Europe.

The early chapters detail the Schuylers&#x27; introduction into New York society and the engagement between Emma and John Day Apgar, a wealthy but rather dull young lawyer and scion of a leading New York family. The later chapters chronicle Schuyler&#x27;s sojourn in Washington, D.C., and Emma&#x27;s growing friendship with the wealthy Denise Sanford and her boorish husband William. Emma and Denise become close friends, but after Denise dies in childbirth, Emma breaks off her engagement to Apgar and marries Sanford instead.

The political backdrop to the story is the 1876 presidential election, a close contest between Tilden and the Republican Rutherford B. Hayes. Tilden won the popular vote, but there was a dispute over the results in Louisiana, Oregon, South Carolina, and Florida. In Florida, the Republican leaders of the State and the Electoral Commission initially reported a victory for Tilden, before deciding that in fact Hayes had won. Vidal builds up to this historic crisis through the activities of a mixed cast of historical and fictional characters, some of the latter having appeared in &quot;Burr&quot; or having descended from characters in that novel.

<doc id="549766" wikidata="Q3255027" url="?curid=549766" title="List of earldoms">
<text>This page lists all earldoms, extant, extinct, dormant, abeyant, or forfeit, in the peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.

The Norman conquest of England introduced the continental Frankish title of &quot;count&quot; (&quot;comes&quot;) into England, which soon became identified with the previous titles of Danish &quot;jarl&quot; and Anglo-Saxon &quot;earl&quot; in England. Until the reign of Edward III in the 14th century, the peerage of England consisted exclusively of earls and barons.

It remains a matter of debate whether early Anglo-Norman counts/earls held their title by tenure (as barons did) or as a personal dignity conferred separately from the land grants. At least three types of early earldoms can be distinguished - (1) earls palatine (e.g. Chester, Pembroke, Durham) whose titles were connected to entire counties, with regal jurisdiction (&quot;jura regalia&quot;) and enjoying full privileges and fruits of royal seigniory, (2) earldoms created by the king and appointed to a county, but only enjoying right to a third of the profits of the pleas of the county court; (3) earldoms created by royal grants of large tracts of land to be held in feudal service (&quot;per servitum unius comitatus&quot;), erecting the tract to a county to support the earldom. Nonetheless, for the last few centuries of English history, earldoms have always been created by letters patent or charters, and the volume of earldoms has long exceeded the number of territorial counties, and, as a result, the names of many earldoms are associated with smaller units (estates, villages, families, etc.).

<text>Consols (originally short for consolidated annuities, but subsequently taken to mean consolidated stock) were government debt issues in the form of perpetual bonds, redeemable at the option of the government. The first British consols were issued by the Bank of England in 1751. They have now been fully redeemed.

The United States government issued consols from 1877 to 1930, which have likewise been redeemed.
==History of British consols==
In 1752 the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Prime Minister Sir Henry Pelham converted all outstanding issues of redeemable government stock into one bond, Consolidated 3.5% Annuities, in order to reduce the coupon (interest rate) paid on the government debt.

In 1757, the annual interest rate on the stock was reduced to 3%, leaving the stock as consolidated 3% annuities. The coupon rate remained at 3% until 1888. In 1888, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Joachim Goschen, converted the consolidated 3% annuities, along with reduced 3% annuities (issued in 1752) and new 3% annuities (1855), into a new bond, 2% consolidated stock, under the National Debt (Conversion) Act 1888 (Goschen&#x27;s Conversion). Under the Act, the interest rate of the stock was reduced to 2% in 1903, and the stock given a first redemption date of 5 April 1923, after which point the stock could be redeemed at par value by Act of Parliament.

In 1927 Chancellor Winston Churchill issued a new government stock, 4% consols, as a partial refinancing of the National War Bonds issued in 1917 during World War I.

===Timeline of 2.5% consolidated stock===

===Final redemption===
On 31 October 2014 the UK Government announced that it would redeem the 4% consols in full in early 2015. It did so on 1 February 2015, and redeemed the 3% and 3% bonds between March and May of that year. The final 2% and 2% bonds were redeemed on 5 July 2015. Section 124 of the Finance Act 2015 made the legal provisions for the ending of the consol.

==References to British consols in literature==
Given their long history, references to consols can be found in many places, including &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; by Jane Austen, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; by Charles Dickens, &quot;The Notting Hill Mystery&quot; by Charles Warren Adams, &quot;Howards End&quot; by E. M. Forster, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; by William Makepeace Thackeray, &quot;The Tuppenny Millionaire&quot; by P G Wodehouse, &quot;Of Human Bondage&quot; by William Somerset Maugham and &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; by John Galsworthy.

<text>Cunife is an alloy of copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), and in some cases cobalt (Co). The alloy has the same linear coefficient of expansion as certain types of glass, and thus makes an ideal material for the lead out wires in light bulbs and thermionic valves. Fernico exhibits a similar property. It is a magnetic alloy and can be used for making magnets.

Cunife has a magnetic coercivity of several hundred oersteds. Unlike most high coercivity magnetic materials which are hard and brittle and need to be cast into shape, cunife can be drawn into thin wires. Wires as thin as five thou can be produced this way. Thicker rods of the material can be threaded which is also something that is not possible with the more commonly used magnetic materials.

In the early 1970s, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation used Cunife magnets in their Wide Range humbucker pickups, however they discontinued use, due to Cunife being hard to source. Fender began producing cunife pickups again in 2020.

<text>The Abingtons are a community in South Cambridgeshire consisting of two small villages: Little Abington and Great Abington, about south east of Cambridge.

== History ==

Though often listed as a single entity, Great and Little Abington have since early medieval times been two parishes divided by the River Granta and remain so. The southernmost of the two, Great Abington, covers and is bounded to the south by the county border with Essex, to the west by a branch of the Icknield Way (now the A11), and to the east by the parish of Hildersham. Little Abington covers , again bordered by the Icknield Way and Hildersham to the west and east, and by the ancient thoroughfare of Wool Street to the north.

The village history dates back to the Bronze Age, some 4000 years ago. The Saxons gave the village its name, originally called &quot;estate named after Abba&quot;, and the village was listed as &quot;Abintone&quot; in the Domesday Book. The &#x27;Great&#x27; and &#x27;Little&#x27; prefixes came later: the Latin &quot;magna&quot; is observed from 1218 and the Modern English &quot;great&quot; from 1523 while the Latin &quot;parva&quot; is observed from 1218 and the Middle English &quot;littel&quot; from 1336.

In the decades before the Second World War the Land Settlement Association created a site to the south of Great Abington consisting of over sixty houses and plots of land for unemployed miners mainly from the former shipyards of Tyneside and coalfields of Yorkshire and Durham.

The Cambridge to Haverhill railway line that opened in 1865 crossed Great Abington just south of the village, but closed in 1967. The medieval Cambridge to Colchester road that was the main route through the village was by-passed in the 1960s.

==Churches==
Great Abington&#x27;s parish church has been dedicated to St Mary since at least the 16th century and comprises a chancel, nave with south aisle and porch, and west tower. The majority of the present building dates from the 13th century, possibly earlier, including the two-storey tower with short leaded spire.

Little Abington&#x27;s parish church is also dedicated to St Mary, and has been since at least the 16th century. The present building consists of a chancel, nave with north chapel and south porch, and west tower. The nave is believed to date from around 1100, and the chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century. The three-storey tower is probably 14th century.

A Protestant chapel was built in Little Abington towards the end of the 19th century. It closed in late 2019 and the land has now been sold. Demolition of the chapel has been confirmed.

==Village life==

The village has a vibrant community with a primary school, village shop, pub, football and cricket team and a large number of local businesses, most of them at Granta Park including The Welding Institute which started in Abington Hall in 1946. In 2009 Abington cricket club played a friendly against Babraham cricket club to commemorate 150 years of the cricket team.

The village also has a village hall, called The Abington Institute, which has a café, a large main hall with video projection and an audio system allowing the showing of films and presentations. It also has a meeting room, another large room overlooking the cricket pitch and two changing rooms with showers. The Institute is used by many local clubs and organisations and also hosts regular lunches for older Abington residents.

The remaining public house, The Three Tuns in Great Abington, is a 17th-century building that was possibly open in 1687 and certainly by 1756. Former pubs in Little Abington include The Crown which closed in the late 20th century, and The Bricklayers&#x27; Arms, which opened in the mid-19th century and was sold in 1912. The Princess (later Prince) of Wales in Great Abington opened at the end of the 19th century and closed in about 1963. The King&#x27;s Arms opened on the Stump Cross to Newmarket road (now the A11) just north of Bourn Bridge in the late 17th century, closing in 1850 with the advent of the railway. The antiquary William Cole was born there while his father was publican. The White Hart opened on the same road just south of the bridge in around 1750, but closed by the end of the century.

<text>Fernico describes a family of metal alloys made primarily of iron, nickel and cobalt. The family includes Kovar, FerNiCo I, FerNiCo II, and Dumet. The name is made up of the chemical symbols of its constituent three elements. &quot;Dumet&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;dual&quot; and &quot;metal,&quot; because it is a heterogeneous alloy, usually fabricated in the form of a wire with an alloy core and a copper cladding. These alloys possess the properties of electrical conductivity, minimal oxidation and formation of porous surfaces at working temperatures of glass and thermal coefficients of expansion which match glass closely. These requirements allow the alloys to be used in glass seals, such that the seal does not crack, fracture or leak with changes in temperature.

Dumet is most commonly used in seals where lead-in wires pass through the glass bulb wall of standard household electric lamps (light bulbs) among other things.

The two Fernico alloys both consist of iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co). Fernico is used at high temperatures and is identical to Kovar. Fernico II is used at cryogenic temperatures in the range. Both are used to create electrically conductive paths through the walls of sealed borosilicate glass containers. Dumet is used for a similar purpose, but is tailored for seals through soda lime and lead alkali silicate glasses.

These alloys adhere to lead-tin, tin, and silver solders. Other metals, including copper, molybdenum, nickel, and steel can be spot-welded to the FerNiCo alloys forming low resistance electrical connections.

== Typical compositions ==
Given in weight %

FerNiCo I has the same linear coefficient of expansion as certain types of borosilicate (&quot;hard&quot; glass), (c6.5 × 10−6K−1, thus serving as an ideal material for the lead-out wires or other seal structures in light bulbs and thermionic valves. Dumet is also used for this purpose, but for passing through softer soda-lime and lead-alkali glasses. This wire is often coated with a glass-like film of sodium metaborate, (), so the molten glass will &quot;wet&quot; and adhere to it. 25% by mass of the finished wire is copper. Cunife exhibits a similar property.

== Uses ==
There are very few uses of Fernico. Some of them are: 
* It is used to seal metals and glass.
* It is often used in the form of nanopowder.

<doc id="549792" wikidata="Q7250337" url="?curid=549792" title="Propionic acidemia">
<text>Propionic acidemia, also known as propionic aciduria or [[propionyl-CoA carboxylase]] deficiency (PCC deficiency), is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder, classified as a branched-chain organic acidemia.

The disorder presents in the early neonatal period with poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, and lack of muscle tone. Without treatment, death can occur quickly, due to secondary hyperammonemia, infection, cardiomyopathy, or brain damage.

==Symptoms and signs==
Propionic acidemia can vary in severity. Severe propionic acidemia lead to symptoms already seen in newborns. Symptoms include poor feeding, vomiting, dehydration, acidosis, low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, and lethargy. The effects of propionic acidemia quickly become life-threatening.

Long-term complications can include intellectual disability, autism, chronic kidney disease, cardiomyopathy, and prolonged QTc interval.

==Pathophysiology==
In healthy individuals, enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase converts propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA. This is one of many steps in the process of converting certain amino acids and fats into energy. Individuals with propionic acidemia cannot perform this conversion because the enzyme propionyl-CoA carboxylase is nonfunctional. The essential amino acids valine, methionine, isoleucine, and threonine can not be converted and this leads to a buildup of propionyl-CoA. Instead of being converted to methylmalonyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA is then converted into propionic acid, which builds up in the bloodstream. This in turn causes an accumulation of dangerous acids and toxins, which can cause damage to the organs.

In many cases, propionic acidemia can damage the brain, heart, kidney, liver, cause seizures and delays to normal development such as walking or talking. The accumulation of propionic acid is known to induce differential responses in different organs. The heart and liver are specific targets of the complication. The patient may need to be hospitalized to prevent breakdown of proteins within the body. Dietary needs must be closely managed.

Mutations in both copies of the &quot;PCCA&quot; or &quot;PCCB&quot; genes cause propionic acidemia. These genes contain instructions to form alpha- and beta-subunits of PCC, the enzyme called propionyl-CoA carboxylase.

PCC is required for the normal breakdown of the essential amino acids valine, isoleucine, threonine, and methionine, as well as certain odd-chained fatty-acids. Mutations in the &quot;PCCA&quot; or &quot;PCCB&quot; genes disrupt the function of the enzyme, preventing these acids from being metabolized. As a result, propionyl-CoA, propionic acid, ketones, ammonia, and other toxic compounds accumulate in the blood, causing the signs and symptoms of propionic acidemia. Hyperammonemia develops due to the inhibitory effects of propionyl-CoA on N-acetylglutamate synthase, indirectly resulting in slowing of the urea cycle.

==Diagnosis==
Elevated metabolites of propionic acid (for example, 3-hydroxypropionate, 2-methylcitrate, tiglylglycine, propionylglycine) found in blood and urine along with normal activity of biotinidase and normal levels of methylmalonic acid.

==Management==
Patients with propionic acidemia should be started as early as possible on a low protein diet. In addition to a protein mixture that is devoid of methionine, threonine, valine, and isoleucine, the patient should also receive -carnitine treatment and should be given antibiotics 10 days per month in order to remove the intestinal propiogenic flora. The patient should have diet protocols prepared for them with a &quot;well day diet&quot; with low protein content, a &quot;half emergency diet&quot; containing half of the protein requirements, and an &quot;emergency diet&quot; with no protein content. These patients are under the risk of severe hyperammonemia during infections that can lead to comatose states.

Liver transplant is gaining a role in the management of these patients, with small series showing improved quality of life.

==Epidemiology==

Propionic acidemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is found in about 1 in 35,000 live births in the United States. The condition appears to be more common in Saudi Arabia, with a frequency of about 1 in 3,000. The condition also appears to be common in Amish, Mennonite and other populations with higher frequency of consanguinity.

==History==
In 1957, a male child was born with poor mental development, repeated attacks of acidosis, and high levels of ketones and glycine in the blood. Upon dietary testing, Dr. Barton Childs discovered that his symptoms worsened when given the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, and threonine. In 1961, the medical team at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland published the case, calling the disorder ketotic hyperglycinemia. In 1969, using data from the original patient&#x27;s sister, scientists established that propionic acidemia was a recessive disorder, and that propionic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia are caused by deficiencies in the same enzyme pathway.

<text>Leod (Scottish Gaelic: Leòd; Old Norse: Ljótr) ( 1200 – 1280) was the eponymous ancestor and founder of Clan MacLeod and Clan MacLeod of Lewis. Almost nothing is known about him and he does not appear in any contemporary records. Tradition dating to the late 18th century made him a son of Olaf the Black who was King of Man (r. 1225–1237). Heraldic evidence, dating to the late 17th century, is considered to be the earliest evidence of descent from Olaf the Black. However, in recent years, this traditional lineage has been challenged and is no longer considered fact by one historian.

According to Clan MacLeod tradition, Leod inherited some of his lands from a foster father, who was a sheriff of the Hebridean island of Skye; other lands he inherited from his father-in-law, who was also a lord on Skye. MacLeod tradition also states that Leod was the father of four sons and two daughters. Two of these sons founded the two main branches of MacLeods; branches which exist to this day—Tormod (from whom the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan descend) and Torquil (from whom the MacLeods of Lewis descend). The traditional belief that Torquil was a son has also been challenged; the current understanding is that he was a great-grandson of Leod. In recent years, the DNA evidence of men bearing surnames equating to &quot;MacLeod&quot; has revealed that a certain proportion share a common ancestor—an ancestor considered to have been the clan&#x27;s founder.

==Traditional ancestry==

According to MacLeod tradition, Leod is the eponymous ancestor of the clan. However, little to nothing is known about this man; he does not appear in any contemporary records. The earliest historical record of a MacLeod chief occurs almost a century after he is thought to have flourished—when the names of &quot;Malcolme, son to Tormode M&#x27;Cloyde&quot;, and that of &quot;Torkyll M&#x27;Cloyd&quot;, appear in a royal charter during the reign of David II, King of Scots (r. 1329–1371). Until quite recently, Leod has generally been considered to have been the son of Olaf the Black, King of Mann and the Isles (r. 1225–1237).

This traditional ancestry may be traced to the late 17th century when a chief adopted the designation of &quot;McOlaus&quot; and another was the first MacLeod to incorporate the royal Manx arms into MacLeod heraldry. In a document dating to 1630, Iain Mòr MacLeod of Dunvegan (chief 1626–1649) appears as &quot;John McOlaus of Dunvegane&quot;—&quot;McOlaus&quot; representing &quot;MacOlaf&quot;. This chief&#x27;s son, Iain Breac (chief 1664–1693), is the first MacLeod to have incorporated the Manx triskelion into his coat of arms. The triskelion was borne in the arms of the kings of Mann and the Isles as far back as the 13th century. The earliest known arms borne by the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan (&quot;pictured top-right&quot;) are, however, quite different the royal Manx arms. These earliest MacLeod arms date to the mid-15th century; recorded in a leading European armorial known as the &quot;Armorial de Berry&quot;. Accordingly, it has been suggested that these points show that 17th-century belief of a descent from Olaf was not one of long standing.

There are various other points which cast serious doubt on Leod&#x27;s traditional ancestry. In 1265, Magnus, King of Mann, the last king of this Manx dynasty died. Later in 1275, Magnus&#x27;s illegitimate son, Godfrey died while leading a revolt. At least two women later came forward with claims for the kingdom—yet Leod and his sons did not. According to W.D.H. Sellar, it is hard to believe that a descendant of the royal line would not have put forward a claim. Another point put forward is that the MacLeods did not adopt the royal names of the 13th century Manx dynasty—names such as &quot;Godfrey&quot; (Old Norse: &quot;Guðrøðr&quot;; Gaelic: &quot;Gofraid&quot;), &quot;Ranald&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Rögnvaldr&quot;; Gaelic: &quot;Raghnall&quot;), &quot;Olaf&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Óláfr&quot;; Gaelic &quot;Amlaíb&quot;), and &quot;Harald&quot; (Old Norse &quot;Haraldr&quot;; Gaelic &quot;Aralt&quot;). Sellar illustrated his point by noting the royal names adopted by the descendants of Somerled (d. 1164) and his wife Ragnhild, daughter of Olaf the Red (grandfather of Olaf the Black).

In the 17th century, George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie wrote a history of the Mackenzies, which included a genealogy of the MacLeods of Lewis (from whom he was also descended). Cromartie&#x27;s genealogy listed Leod as a son of Harald, son of Godred Donn. Later genealogies, however, made Leod a son of Olaf the Black—genealogies found in Sir Robert Douglas of Glenbervie&#x27;s &quot;Baronage of Scotland&quot;, of 1798; and the &quot;Bannatyne manuscript&quot;, which dates to about 1830. In the &quot;Baronage of Scotland&quot;, Glenbervie stated that he had obtained information from the MacLeods of Dunvegan which was allegedly based upon information found within the mediaeval &quot;Chronicles of Mann&quot; and William Camden&#x27;s 17th century &quot;Britannia&quot;—however, neither of these two works make any mention of Leod at all. In 1977, historian William Matheson rejected the traditional descent from Olaf the Black on the basis that it is unsupported by any facts whatsoever, and that it is also contradicted by earlier, more authentic, Gaelic-language genealogies.

===Traditional genealogies reconsidered===
In recent years, several historians have noted that within the Gaelic-language genealogies and praise-poetry concerning the MacLeods, Leod&#x27;s great-grandfather&#x27;s name appears to equate to the Old Norse &quot;Ölvir&quot;, &quot;Olvér&quot;; rather than the Old Norse &quot;Óláfr&quot;. There are considered to be four significant Gaelic-language genealogies which concern Leod&#x27;s ancestry. These pedigrees roughly agree with one another in the three generations after Leod. The greatest similarity between these genealogies are the names of Leod&#x27;s great-grandfather, variously spelt &quot;Oilmoir&quot;, &quot;Olbair Snaige&quot;, &quot;Olbuir Snaithe&quot;, and &quot;Olbair Snoice&quot;. Taking into account variances in spelling, these names are now considered to represent the literary Gaelic &quot;Olbhar&quot;, and the vernacular Gaelic &quot;Olghair&quot;; both which are in turn forms of &quot;Ölvir&quot;.

Matheson proposed that when Camden published his &quot;Britannia&quot; which included an account of the kings of Mann, genealogists saw the Latin &quot;Olavus&quot; (a Latin form of the Old Norse &quot;Óláfr&quot;) and concluded that it represented the Gaelic name &quot;Olbhar&quot;, &quot;Olghair&quot;. However, the Scottish Gaelic form of &quot;Olaf&quot;, &quot;Olavus&quot;, &quot;Olaus&quot;, &quot;Óláfr&quot;, is in fact &quot;Amhlaoibh&quot;, and the more modern &quot;Amhlaidh&quot;. Matheson further proposed that Leod&#x27;s father&#x27;s name also equates to &quot;Ölvir&quot;. So in Matheson&#x27;s opinion, genealogists mistakenly attached Leod&#x27;s father and great-grandfather to the Manx king Olaf the Black and his own grandfather, Olaf the Red. While Matheson&#x27;s identification of the name of Leod&#x27;s grandfather is now accepted, Sellar later disagreed with him on the name of Leod&#x27;s father; proposing instead that it was more likely the Gaelic name &quot;Gillemuire&quot;—a name which appears on one of the four Gaelic-language genealogies.

Leod&#x27;s name is represented in Scottish Gaelic as &quot;Leòd&quot;. This name is a Gaelic form of the Old Norse &quot;Ljótr&quot;, meaning &quot;ugly&quot;. Matheson stated that this Norse name was rare in both Scandinavia and Iceland. He noted that in Scotland it was peculiar to the MacLeods, though it is almost never used within the clan. Matheson speculated that Leod&#x27;s great-grandfather would have likely flourished at about the same time as Olvir Rosta was supposedly exiled to the Outer Hebrides. Matheson went even further and proposed that Leod&#x27;s great-grandfather was in fact Olvir Rosta—a character from the mediaeval &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;. Matheson noted that while the name &quot;Ljótr&quot; is rare, Olvir Rosta&#x27;s maternal grandfather appears in the saga as &quot;Ljótr níðingr&quot; (&#x27;Ljótr Villain&#x27;). In Matheson&#x27;s opinion, since the Gaelic-language genealogies are inconsistent in the generations further back than Leod&#x27;s great-grandfather, this may show that the man was a newcomer in the area. Sellar, however, rejected Matheson&#x27;s proposal, commenting that such evidence was entirely circumstantial. Sellar stated that &quot;Olvir&quot; was not such a rare name; also, Olvir Rosta&#x27;s genealogy and family within the saga (see above right) has no similarity with that recorded in the Gaelic-language genealogies relevant to Leod.

In contrast to Matheson&#x27;s opinion about the name &quot;Ljótr&quot;, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was of the opinion that the name may not be as rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod&#x27;s time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod&#x27;s name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr&#x27;s; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.

==Leod in clan tradition==

===Clans Mackenzie and Ross===
The first earl of Cromartie&#x27;s 17th century genealogical account of the MacLeods relates how Leod (&quot;Leodus&quot;) was a son of Harald, son of Godred Donn. When the Isle of Man passed into the possession of the Scots, Alexander III granted Lewis, Harris, Waternish, and Minginish to Harald. Leod later succeeded his father to the lands as his father&#x27;s only son. Cromartie&#x27;s account also states how Leod&#x27;s wife was Adama, daughter of Fearchar, Earl of Ross. However, according to Sellar, there is no record of a son of Harald named &quot;Leod&quot;, nor is there any record of a daughter of Fearchar named &quot;Adama&quot;. Sellar also noted that there is no record of the grant of lands by Alexander III. Sellar went so far as to state that Leod&#x27;s wife, father, and the grant, were nothing but figments of Cromartie&#x27;s imagination. The manuscript history of the Rosses of Balnagown also notes Leod. This account, according to the 19th-century historian W.F. Skene, is older than that of Cromartie&#x27;s. The manuscript states that a King of Denmark had three sons who came to the north of Scotland—Gwine, Loid, and Leandres. Gwine conquered the braes of Caithness; Loid conquered Lewis, and was the progenitor of the MacLeods; and Leandres conquered &quot;Braychat be the sworde&quot;. Skene stated that &quot;Gwine&quot; likely was meant to refer to the eponymous ancestor of the Clan Gunn, and that &quot;Leandres&quot; refers to the Gilleandres whom &quot;Clan Andres, or old Rosses&quot; took their name.

===Clan MacLeod===

According to an account of MacLeod tradition written in 1797 for the clan&#x27;s chief, Olaf the Black had three sons by his third wife, Christina, daughter of the Earl of Ross—&quot;Gunn&quot;, from whom descended Clan Gunn; &quot;Leandres&quot;, from whom descended Clan Leandres in Ross; and &quot;Leod&quot;. The tradition goes on to say that Leod was fostered by &quot;Pol, son of Bok&quot;, sheriff of Skye. This Pol then gave Leod Harris; later Leod married a daughter of &quot;McCraild Armuinn&quot; and, in consequence, received Dunvegan and all the Skye estates which the MacLeods held in later times. In the &quot;Bannatyne manuscript&quot;, the sheriff is called &quot;Paal Baccas&quot;, and is stated to have owned the isle of Harris, as well as the following lands on Skye: Sleat, Trotternish, Waternish, and Snizort. The manuscript states that he had a natural son, but named Leod his heir. The &quot;Pol, son of Bok&quot; and &quot;Paal Baccas&quot; of MacLeod tradition are considered to be identical with the historical Páll, son of Bálki, who is mentioned within the &quot;Chronicles of Mann&quot; as a loyal ally of Olaf the Black. The &quot;Bannatyne manuscript&quot; states that Paal Baccas was killed in 1231; after which Leod peacefully succeeded to his possessions.

The &quot;Bannatyne manuscript&quot; is the main authority for information on the early chiefs of Clan MacLeod. It states that the first seven chiefs of Clan MacLeod were buried at Iona. The choir of Iona Abbey, for the most part, dates from the early 16th century. Within the centre of the choir there is a large stone which once contained a monumental brass, traditionally said to have been a MacLeod. The stone formed a matrix which at one time contained the brass inlay (tradition states it was a silver inlay). It is the largest carved stone on the island, measuring by . The early 20th-century clan historian R.C. MacLeod speculated that perhaps Leod and five of his successors were buried beneath—however, in his opinion the fourth chief, Iain Ciar, was buried elsewhere. In fact, the stone may actually mark the tomb of a MacLean, rather than that of a MacLeod.

===Issue===
According to MacLeod tradition, Leod had two sons—Tormod and Torquil. The tradition is that Tormod was the ancestor of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan (the chiefs of Clan MacLeod), and Torquil was the ancestor of the MacLeods of Lewis. The &quot;Bannatyne manuscript&quot; does not specifically state which son was the elder, and subsequently there has been debate over which branch was more &#x27;senior&#x27; in descent. In the late 20th century, Matheson called into question this tradition of brothers, and his work was followed up by other historians. The current view of historians is that the two were not brothers at all; but that Torquil was actually the grandson of Tormod.

The &quot;Bannatyne manuscript&quot; also names two other sons; however, Matheson considered the manuscript to be of dubious authority, since it is the only source for these names. It lists Leod&#x27;s third son as John, stating that John followed Bruce to Ireland. The manuscript continues that in Ireland he acquired considerable estates in Galway and was knighted; although he was the principal man of his name there, his descendants were known not as &quot;MacLeods&quot;, but as &quot;MacElliots&quot;. The manuscript states that his daughter, and heiress, married Maurice, 2nd Lord of Kerry. According to MacLeod, the statement about John following Bruce to Ireland is a mistake, since John&#x27;s daughter couldn&#x27;t have married later than 1285. Bruce was, however, born in 1275, and did not go to Ireland until 1306. Leod&#x27;s fourth son is listed by the manuscript as being Olaus. The account states that this Olaus was the reputed ancestor of the MacLewis, or Fullarton family, which originated on the Isle of Arran and that this family traced its ancestry from Lewis, or MacLoy, son of Olaus, son of Leod.

The manuscript also states that Leod also had two daughters. Again, the manuscript is the only source for the existence of these offspring and does not mention their names. It states that one of the daughters married Fergus of Galloway; while the other married John, Lord of Mull. It is unknown who these men could have been.

==DNA and the founder of Clan MacLeod==
In 2011, DNA tests were performed on a sample of 45 men with the surname &quot;MacLeod&quot;; 47% were found to share a common ancestor in the male line (the remaining 53% of the sample contained 9 different genetic male line lineages). The genetic marker of the 47%-lineage was found to be the S68 branch of Haplogroup R1b. This marker is found not only in the Western Isles, but also in Orkney, Shetland, England, Norway, and Sweden. In consequence, the study concluded that the genetic origin of Clan MacLeod likely lies in Scandinavia.

<text>Jacob Roggeveen (1 February 1659 – 31 January 1729) was a Dutch explorer who was sent to find Terra Australis and Davis Land, but instead found Easter Island (called so because he landed there on Easter Sunday). Jacob Roggeveen also found Bora Bora and Maupiti of the Society Islands, as well as Samoa. He planned the expedition along with his brother Jan Roggeveen, who stayed in the Netherlands.

==Early career==

His father, Arend Roggeveen, was a mathematician with much knowledge of astronomy, geography, rhetorics, philosophy, and the theory of navigation as well. He occupied himself with study of the mythical Terra Australis, and even got a patent for an exploratory excursion, but it was to be his son who, at the age of 62, eventually equipped three ships and made the expedition.

He became notary of Middelburg (the capital of the province of Zeeland, where he was born). On 12 August 1690, he graduated as a doctor of the law at the University of Harderwijk. About this time he married Marija Margaerita Vincentius. She died around 3 to 4 years later in October 1694. In 1706, he joined the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC), and between 1707 and 1714 worked as a &quot;Raadsheer van Justitie&quot; (&quot;Council Lord of Justice&quot;) at Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta). He married Anna Adriana Clement there, but she died soon afterward. In 1714, he returned to Middelburg by himself.

He became involved in religious controversies, supporting the liberal preacher Pontiaan van Hattem by publishing his leaflet &quot;De val van &#x27;s werelds afgod&quot; (The fall of the world&#x27;s idol). The first part appeared in 1718 in Middelburg, and was subsequently confiscated by the city council and burned. Roggeveen fled from Middelburg to nearby Flushing. Thereafter he established himself in the small town of Arnemuiden, and published parts 2 and 3 of the series, again raising a controversy.

==Explorations==

On 1 August 1721 he headed an expedition sponsored by the Dutch West India Company, the rivals of the VOC, to seek Terra Australis and to open a western trade route to the &quot;Spice islands&quot; in the East Indies. His fleet consisted of three ships, the &quot;Arend&quot;, the &quot;Thienhoven&quot;, and &quot;Afrikaansche Galey&quot; and had 223 men on crew.
Roggeveen first sailed down to the Falkland Islands (which he renamed &quot;Belgia Australis&quot;), passed through the Strait of Le Maire, and continued south to beyond 60 degrees south to enter the Pacific Ocean. He made landfall near Valdivia, Chile. He visited the Juan Fernández Islands, where he spent 24 February to 17 March. The expedition later arrived at Easter Island (Rapa Nui) on Easter Sunday, 5 April 1722 (whereupon he reported seeing 2,000–3,000 inhabitants). Roggeveen charted the location of six islands in the Tuamotu Archipelago, two islands in the Society Islands, and four islands in Samoa, losing his flagship, &quot;Afrikaansche Galey&quot; at Takapoto atoll. At Makatea, he opened fire on a crowded beach in retaliation for a violent encounter with the inhabitants, and in return the Makateans ambushed a shore party, killing ten of his crewmen. The remaining two vessels sailed past New Guinea to reach Batavia in 1722, where he was arrested for violating the monopoly of the VOC and had his ships confiscated. After a lengthy lawsuit in the Netherlands, the VOC was later forced to compensate him for his losses and to pay his crew.

After his return, Roggeveen published part 4 of his work, &quot;De val van &#x27;s werelds afgod&quot;.

<text>The &quot;X Article&quot; is an article, formally titled &quot;The Sources of Soviet Conduct&quot;, written by George F. Kennan and published under the pseudonym &quot;X&quot; in the July 1947 issue of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine. It introduced the term &quot;containment&quot; to widespread use and advocated the strategic use of that concept against the Soviet Union. It expanded on ideas expressed by Kennan in a confidential February 1946 telegram, formally identified by Kennan&#x27;s State Department number, &quot;511&quot;, but informally dubbed the &quot;long telegram&quot; for its size.

Kennan composed the long telegram in response to inquiries about the implications of a February 1946 speech by Joseph Stalin. Though the speech was in line with previous statements by Stalin, it provoked fear in the American press and public; &quot;Time&quot; magazine called it &quot;the most warlike pronouncement uttered by any top-rank statesman since V-J Day&quot;. The long telegram explained Soviet motivations by recounting the history of Russian rulers as well as the ideology of Marxism–Leninism. It argued that the Soviet leaders used the ideology to characterize the external world as hostile, allowing them to justify their continued hold on power despite a lack of popular support. Washington bureaucrats quickly read the confidential message and accepted it as the best explanation of Soviet behavior. The reception elevated Kennan&#x27;s reputation within the State Department as one of the government&#x27;s foremost Soviet experts.

After hearing Kennan speak about Soviet foreign relations at the Council on Foreign Relations in January 1947, international banker R. Gordon Wasson suggested that he share his views in an article for &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. Kennan revised a piece he had submitted to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal in late January 1947, but his role in government precluded him from publishing under his name. His superiors granted him approval to publish the piece provided it was released anonymously; &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; attributed the article only to &quot;X&quot;. Expressing similar sentiments to that of the long telegram, the piece was strong in its anti-communism, introducing and outlining a basic theory of containment. The article was widely read; though it does not mention the Truman Doctrine, having mostly been written before Truman&#x27;s speech, it quickly became seen as an expression of the doctrine&#x27;s policy. Retrospective commentators dispute the impact of the article, although Henry Kissinger referred to it as &quot;the diplomatic doctrine of the era&quot;.

==Background==
Joseph Stalin, General Secretary and de facto leader of the Soviet Union, spoke at the Bolshoi Theatre on February 9, 1946, the night before the symbolic 1946 Supreme Soviet election. The speech did not discuss foreign policy, but instead made pledges to expand industry. He justified the expansion by pointing to Marxist–Leninist theory, warning that capitalism possessed a predisposition towards conflict.

Stalin&#x27;s speech provoked fear in the American press and public, with &quot;Time&quot; magazine calling it &quot;the most warlike pronouncement uttered by any top-rank statesman since V-J Day.&quot; George F. Kennan, then working for the US State Department as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; in Moscow, found the speech routine and reflective of previous statements from Stalin. With this in mind, he issued only a quick summary of the speech for the State Department. Despite the familiar statements from Stalin, the context in which they were made – including the Soviet Union&#x27;s recent rejection of Bretton Woods and evidence of atomic espionage in the United States and Canada – alarmed officials in Washington. In a 1982 interview, former diplomat Elbridge Durbrow expressed that Stalin&#x27;s speech had in effect said, &quot;to hell with the rest of the world.&quot; US President Harry Truman was confused by the Soviet&#x27;s policies, at times appearing belligerent and at others exercising self-restraint. Leaders were increasingly coming to the conclusion that the existing &quot;quid pro quo&quot; strategy was ineffective against the Soviets, but had no replacement strategy.

Durbrow and another diplomat, H. Freeman Matthews – both readers of Kennan&#x27;s earlier telegrams – were confused by Kennan&#x27;s relative silence about the speech. On 13 February, Matthews drafted a message, signed by Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, asking for an analysis. The message described the press and public&#x27;s reaction having been, &quot;to a degree not hitherto felt&quot;, and expressed: &quot;We should welcome receiving from you an interpretive analysis of what we may expect in the way of future implementation of these announced policies.&quot; W. Averell Harriman, having recently returned from his ambassadorship to the Soviet Union, spoke to Kennan and encouraged him to write a thorough analysis.

==The &quot;long telegram&quot;==
Kennan probably wrote rough drafts of a message before dictating a final version to his secretary, Dorothy Hessman, on February 22, 1946. Finishing late at night, he took the message to the Mokhovaya code room in Moscow and had it telegraphed back to Washington. The message was quickly dubbed the &quot;long telegram&quot; because, at a little over 5,000 words, it was the longest telegram sent in the history of the State Department.

Identified as &quot;511&quot; by Kennan&#x27;s State Department number, the message is divided into five sections, covering the Soviet Union&#x27;s background, current features, future prospects and the implications these would have for the United States. It opens with an apology for its length but qualifies the necessity of responding to all the then pressing concerns at once. Kennan begins by laying out the world from the Soviet perspective, splitting it into socialist and capitalist sectors. The alliance between the United States and Great Britain was destined to fail, and would either lead to war between them or a joint attack on the Soviet Union. The Soviets believed they would ultimately prevail in such a conflict, but would need to grow their strength and exploit the capitalists&#x27; tendency towards conflict amongst one another in the meantime. Kennan described these ideas as absurd, pointing out that capitalist countries were not failing and were not always in conflict. Further, he described the idea that the United States and Great Britain would deliberately enter into a war against the Soviets as the &quot;sheerest nonsense&quot;.

The Soviet leaders reached these illogical sentiments, he explained, because &quot;...at the bottom of the Kremlin&#x27;s view of world affairs is a traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity.&quot; The authority of previous Russian rulers was &quot;archaic in form, fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison or contact with political systems of western countries&quot;. This understanding of Russian history was joined with the ideology of Marxism-Leninism. Their obstinacy in dealing with the West was born out of necessity; seeing the rest of the world as hostile provided an excuse &quot;for the dictatorship without which they did not know how to rule, for cruelties they did not dare not to inflict, for sacrifices they felt bound to demand&quot;. Until the Soviet Union either experienced consistent failures or their leader was persuaded that they were negatively affecting their nation&#x27;s interest, the West could not expect any reciprocity from the Soviets.

The Soviet government, Kennan continued, could be understood as occupying two distinct spaces: an official, visible government, and another operating without any official acknowledgement. While the former would participate in international diplomacy, the latter would attempt to undermine the capitalist nations as much as possible, including efforts to &quot;disrupt national self confidence, to hamstring measures of national defense, to increase social and industrial unrest, to stimulate all forms of disunity.&quot; He opined that the Soviets ultimately have no expectation of reconciliation with the West.

Kennan concluded not by offering specific courses of action, but instead offered more general solutions, such as the necessity of maintaining courage and self-confidence in interactions with the Soviets. Managing the threat would require &quot;the same thoroughness and care as solution of major strategic problem in war, and if necessary, with no smaller outlay in planning effort&quot;. He wrote that, compared to Nazi Germany, the Soviets are much more patient and often risk averse. Russia&#x27;s being weaker than the West, not having regular procedures for replacing leaders, having absorbed too many territories, failing to inspire its people, and being overly reliant on negative propaganda, meant that &quot;we may approach calmly and with good heart [the] problem of how to deal with Russia.&quot;

Kennan emphasized the need of educating the American public about the threat of international communism. Keeping Western society strong was important to ward off the expansive tendencies of communism: &quot;The greatest danger that can befall us in coping with this problem of Soviet communism, is that we shall allow ourselves to become like those with whom we are coping.&quot;

==Impact of the &quot;long telegram&quot;==

===On American foreign policy===

Matthews sent Kennan a cable praising the telegram, describing it as &quot;magnificent&quot;, adding, &quot;I cannot overestimate its importance to those of us here struggling with the problem.&quot; Byrnes praised it as well, writing he had read it &quot;with the greatest interest&quot; and describing it as &quot;a splendid analysis&quot;. Harriman was less enthused, calling it &quot;fairly long, and a little bit slow reading in spots.&quot; He nonetheless sent a copy to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. Forrestal was largely responsible for the spread of the long telegram, sending copies across Washington. It gained a larger readership than was typical for a classified document, with readers including ambassador to Cuba Henry Norweb, British diplomat Frank Roberts, General George C. Marshall and President Truman.

The long telegram was quickly read and accepted by Washington bureaucrats as the best explanation of Soviet behavior. Policymakers, military officials and intelligence analysts generally came to understand that the Soviet Union&#x27;s primary foreign policy goal was world domination under a Communist state. Historian John Lewis Gaddis writes that the ultimate impact of the long telegram is that it &quot;became the basis for United States strategy toward the Soviet Union throughout the rest of the Cold War&quot;, and that it &quot;won [Kennan] the reputation of being the government&#x27;s foremost Soviet expert&quot;. In 1967, Kennan reflected &quot;My reputation was made. My voice now carried.&quot; In mid-April 1946, at Forrestal&#x27;s insistence, Kennan received an appointment in the National War College as Deputy for Foreign Affairs.

The Truman administration quickly accepted Kennan&#x27;s conclusion that the Soviets had no reasonable grievances with the West and would never cooperate with capitalist states. It was therefore senseless to try and address Soviet concerns, leaving a policy of containing Soviet interests as the best response. Historian Louis Halle writes that the timing of the long telegram&#x27;s appearance was important, &quot;[coming] right at a time when the Department... was floundering about, looking for new intellectual moorings.&quot; He continues that the telegram served as &quot;a new and realistic conception to which it might attach itself.&quot; Gaddis and historian Wilson D. Miscamble both believe that Halle overstates Kennan&#x27;s impact on State Department thinking, emphasizing that the Department was already moving towards a more adversarial position against the Soviets, though Miscamble concedes, &quot;there can be no doubt that Kennan&#x27;s cable exercised a catalytic effect upon departmental thinking especially as regards the possibility of the United States achieving any non-adversary relationship with the Soviet Union.&quot;

Offering a different perspective, Matthews notes in a letter of March 12, 1946, that the administration had already moved in the direction of not catering to Soviet interests before the long telegram, pointing to a speech Byrnes delivered on 28 February, drafted before Byrnes had read Kennan&#x27;s message. In the speech, Byrnes explains: &quot;We will not and we cannot stand aloof if force or threat is used contrary to the purposes of the [United Nations] Charter... If we are to be a great power we must act as a great power, not only in order to ensure our own security but in order to preserve the peace of the world.&quot; Matthews explains that long telegram would instead serve as the administration&#x27;s rationale for subsequent actions. Historian Melvyn P. Leffler points out that before the long telegram had circulated widely, the Joint Chiefs of Staff had already resolved in February 1946 that &quot;collaboration with the Soviet Union should stop short not only of compromise of principle but also of expansion of Russian influence in Europe and in the Far East.
===On the Soviet Union===
Though the long telegram was a classified document, it circulated widely enough that a copy leaked out to Soviet intelligence. Stalin was among its readers and called on his American ambassador, Nikolai Novikov, to send a similar telegram from Washington to Moscow. Ghostwritten by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, the piece was sent on September 27, 1946. Representative of Stalin&#x27;s opinions, Novikov&#x27;s telegram argued in part: &quot;The foreign policy of the United States reflects the imperialistic tendencies of American monopolistic capitalism, [and] is characterized... by a striving for world supremacy.&quot; America would attempt to achieve supremacy by cooperating with Great Britain, but their cooperation was &quot;plagued with great internal contradictions and cannot be lasting... It is quite possible that the Near East will become a center of Anglo-American contradictions that will explode the agreements now reached between the United States and England.&quot;

Kennan provided commentary on Novikov&#x27;s telegram in a 1991 piece for the journal &quot;Diplomatic History&quot;. He wrote in part, &quot;These poor people, put on the spot, produced the thing,&quot; but &quot;it was only a way of saying to their masters in Moscow: &#x27;How true, sir!.

==&quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article==

===Origins===

On January 7, 1947, Kennan spoke at the Council on Foreign Relations, based at the Harold Pratt House in New York City. The theme of the meeting was &quot;Soviet Foreign Relations&quot;, presented to a small group and designated as &quot;not for attribution&quot;. Kennan did not prepare a written speech, having given dozens of similar talks in the years before. In his talk, he discussed the Soviet leaders&#x27; perspectives on the rest of the world, rooted in both their Marxist-Leninist ideology and Russian history. The Soviets justified their dictatorship by pointing to external enemies, most of which were imaginary. For change to occur, the United States and its allies would need to &quot;contain&quot; the Soviets in a &quot;non-provocative way&quot;.

International banker R. Gordon Wasson attended the discussion and was impressed by Kennan, suggesting that the Council revise the talk for publication in their journal &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. Journal editor Hamilton Fish Armstrong had not attended the discussion but requested on January 10 that Kennan revise his talk into an article. Kennan responded to Armstrong in a letter of February 4, writing, &quot;I really can not write anything of value on Russia for publication under my own name. If you would be interested in an anonymous article, or one under a pen name... I might be able to make the necessary arrangements.&quot; Armstrong replied on March 7, agreeing to Kennan&#x27;s suggestion, writing that the &quot;disadvantage of anonymity&quot; was outweighed by the potential importance of the article.

Taking time off from the State Department, Kennan worked as a lecturer at the National War College. His work left him little time to write a new essay, so he searched for previous work to repurpose. In January 1946, Forrestal had asked Kennan for an analysis of a piece by Smith College professor Edward F. Willett entitled &quot;Dialectical Materialism And Russian Objectives&quot;. Kennan was unimpressed with the work, but decided that rather than denigrating the piece he would instead publish a new analysis. The paper, titled &quot;Psychological Background of Soviet Foreign Policy&quot;, was around six thousand words. In late January 1946 he sent it to Forrestal, who described it as &quot;extremely well-done&quot; before sending it on to General Marshall. In a letter of March 10 to John T. Connor, an aide of Forrestal, Kennan inquired as to whether it would be appropriate to publish this piece anonymously in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. Forrestal agreed, as did the State Department&#x27;s Committee on Unofficial Publications.

Kennan made several minor corrections to the piece, along with scratching his name out and writing &quot;X&quot; in its place. He added a note on authorship, writing: &quot;The author of this article is one who has had long experience with Russian affairs, both practically and academically, but whose position makes it impossible for him to write about them under his own name.&quot; Armstrong published Kennan&#x27;s piece under the title &quot;The Sources of Soviet Conduct&quot;, removing Kennan&#x27;s note and leaving only the &quot;X&quot; as an identifier.

===&quot;The Sources of Soviet Conduct&quot;===

Kennan&#x27;s piece opens with a description of how the Soviet leaders were shaped by Marxism-Leninism, serving as the &quot;pseudo-scientific justification&quot; for why Stalin and the other leaders ought to remain in power despite lacking popular support. At times quoting Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, he writes that the Soviet leaders&#x27; &quot;aggressive intransigence&quot; against the outside world compelled them &quot;to chastise the contumacy&quot; which they had provoked. In order to maintain power, the Soviet leaders would need to maintain the illusion of external threats: 

The Soviets, however, were not prepared to attempt an immediate overthrow of the West, it being implicit in their ideology that capitalism would inevitably fail. They would instead turn their focus to the long-term goal of &quot;[filling] every nook and cranny available to it in the basin of world power.&quot; To oppose them, the United States would need long-term strategies to contain Soviet expansionary ambitions. Containment against the Soviets, Kennan explains, would require an application of &quot;counter-force&quot; along shifting points of geographical and political interests. This &quot;perimeter defense&quot; concept, in which all geographic areas were considered of equal importance, required the United States &quot;to confront the Russians with unalterable counter-force at every point where they show signs of encroaching upon the interests of a peaceful and stable world.&quot;

Containment would prove its success in the long-term because the Soviet economy was rudimentary and the government leadership lacked procedures for orderly succession. Any disruption in Soviet politics held the possibility of &quot;[changing the state] overnight from one of the strongest to one of the weakest and most pitiable of national societies.&quot; Containment was particularly suited for use against the Soviets, Kennan thought, because of their Marxist-Leninist ideology, which encourages a patience not evident with leaders like Napoleon or Adolf Hitler. He continues: &quot;...the Kremlin is under no ideological compulsion to accomplish its purposes in a hurry. Like the Church, it is dealing in ideological concepts which are of long-term valididty... It has no right to risk the existing achievements of the revolution for the sake of vain baubles of the future.&quot;

The end result of containment would allow for &quot;either the break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power&quot;. The indefinite frustration the Soviets were bound to face would necessitate their adjustment to the reality of their situation. The strategy would require the United States to manage its own issues successfully, with Kennan concluding that: &quot;To avoid destruction the United States need only measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation. Surely, there was never a fairer test of national quality than this.&quot;

==Impact of the &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; article==

===Immediate===
Armstrong wrote to Kennan in May 1947: &quot;It&#x27;s a pleasure for an editor to deal with something that needs practically no revision... I only wish for your sake as well as for ours that it could carry your name.&quot; The long delay between its writing and publication – some five months – meant the piece did not discuss either of the recent communist uprisings in Greece and Turkey, nor did it mention the Truman Doctrine. The piece was due for inclusion in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;″ next issue, July 1947. With a little over 19,000 subscribers and an expensive cover price for the time of $1.25 (), the magazine did not circulate widely. The July issue did not deviate from regular buying trends, until journalist Arthur Krock drew attention to the &quot;X&quot; article in an &quot;The New York Times&quot; column of July 8. Krock suggested that the main thrust of &quot;The Sources of Soviet Conduct&quot; was &quot;exactly that adopted by the American government after appeasement of the Kremlin proved a failure&quot;, and wrote that the piece&#x27;s author had clearly studied the Soviet Union &quot;at the closest range possible for a foreigner&quot;. Krock concludes that the author&#x27;s views &quot;closely resemble those marked &#x27;Top Secret&#x27; in several official files in Washington.&quot;

Krock&#x27;s column resulted in a rush for copies of &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. He had not identified Kennan as &quot;X&quot; in his column, but proved responsible for revealing Kennan&#x27;s identity; Forrestal had let Krock see the draft copy sent to &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; which still contained Kennan&#x27;s name at its end. Other diplomats suspected Kennan&#x27;s authorship due to the piece&#x27;s distinct prose as well as the quoting of Edward Gibbon. As the rumor spread, the State Department offered no comment. The &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, the newspaper of the Communist Party of the United States, broke the story on Kennan&#x27;s identity, with a headline on July 9 that read: X&#x27; Bared as State Dep&#x27;t Aid : Calls for Overthrow of Soviet Government&quot;.

Kennan&#x27;s role in the State Department lent the article the authority of an official policy declaration. Though he had not intended the article to be a comprehensive statement on American foreign policy, a piece in the 21 July issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot; explained that the &quot;X&quot; article provided a rationale for both the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan and &quot;[charted] the course that this country is likely to pursue for years to come.&quot; Marshall, concerned by the amount of attention both Kennan and the article were drawing, spoke with Kennan in a private meeting. Kennan&#x27;s explanation that the article had been &quot;cleared for publication by the competent official committee&quot; satisfied Marshall, &quot;[b]ut it was long, I suspect, before he recovered from his astonishment over the strange ways of the department he now headed.&quot;

===Walter Lippmann&#x27;s critique===
Political commentator Walter Lippmann responded to the article, published in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; across fourteen different columns, the first which appeared on September 2, 1947. Lippmann&#x27;s analysis was widely read and collected in his 1947 book, &quot;The Cold War&quot;. Lippmann critiqued the article as having presented a &quot;strategic monstrosity&quot;, providing the Soviets with the initiative in any conflict, resulting in the United States depending on &quot;a coalition of disorganized, disunited, feeble or disorderly nations, tribes and factions.&quot;

Lippmann incorrectly concluded that Kennan&#x27;s article had inspired the Truman Doctrine, which Lippmann opposed. Kennan&#x27;s article was completed in late January 1947 and Truman announced his Doctrine in a March 12, 1947 speech. Despite this chronology, Gaddis writes: &quot;there is no evidence that it influenced the drafting of that address and abundant evidence that Kennan had sought to remove the language in it to which Lippmann later objected.&quot; For Lippmann, however, the piece was &quot;not only an analytical interpretation of the sources of Soviet conduct. It is also a document of primary importance on the sources of American foreign policy – of at least that part of it which is known as the Truman Doctrine.&quot;

Because of the rushed nature in which Kennan had written the article, he regretted some views expressed within and agreed with some of Lippmann&#x27;s critiques. Though Kennan did not send the final draft of the piece until 11 April – a month after the announcement of the Truman Doctrine – he did not revise it, despite having disagreements with sections of the Doctrine. Kennan&#x27;s position in the State Department made him hesitant to offer any public clarification, and he would not respond until the publication of the first volume of his memoirs in 1967.

===Long term===
&quot;The Sources of Soviet Conduct&quot; widely introduced the term &quot;containment&quot;. Reflecting on the article in his 1979 memoir, Henry Kissinger writes, &quot;George Kennan came as close to authoring the diplomatic doctrine of his era as any diplomat in our history.&quot; Gaddis writes that Kennan&#x27;s silence in the face of Lippmann&#x27;s critiques resulted in the idea of containment becoming &quot;synonymous, in the minds of most people who knew the phrase, with Truman&#x27;s doctrine&quot;. Gaddis further writes that some have misinterpreted Kennan&#x27;s views by placing undue emphasis on the &quot;conspicuous but misleading &#x27;X&#x27; article&quot;.

In the article, Kennan uses the term &quot;counterforce&quot; rather than &quot;counter-pressure&quot; and does not explain its meaning, something he admitted in his memoirs led to confusion for readers. Kennan reassessed his views on perimeter defense after the article was published, instead shifting to the idea of &quot;strongpoint defense&quot;, in which defense was instead focused on particular areas.

Kennan recalled in his memoirs that his &quot;entire diplomatic experience took place in rather high northern latitudes&quot;. Thomas Borstelmann writes that Kennan&#x27;s few experiences outside of Europe contributed to his detestation of the people of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America: &quot;He tended to lump them together as impulsive, fanatical, ignorant, lazy, unhappy, and prone to mental disorders and other biological deficiencies.&quot; In the first of his memoirs, published in 1967, Kennan links Soviet despotism to its leaders &quot;attitude of Oriental secretiveness and conspiracy&quot;. In a 1942 lecture, he explained that the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 revealed the Russians were not &quot;westernized&quot; but instead &quot;17th century semi-Asiatic people&quot;. Borstelmann further writes that Kennan&#x27;s perspectives on race were not unique to him but were instead common in his contemporary American policymaking circles.

<text>The State Examinations Commission () is the organisation that replaced the Examinations Branch of the Department of Education in Ireland.

==History==
The State Examinations Commission is a State body established by statutory order on 6 March 2003. The Commission assumed responsibility for the operation of the State Certificate Examinations from the Department of Education.

The State Examinations Commission has an online system which allows examination candidates to view their results on its website.

==Organisation==
The commission is staffed by civil servants and there are five Commissioners appointed by the Minister for Education.

==Functions==
The commission oversees the state examinations at secondary education level in Ireland. Its offices are located in Athlone, County Westmeath. The two examinations the commission oversees for accreditation and certification are:

* Junior Cycle
* Leaving Certificate

Typically about 60,000 students present for each of these examinations each year, generally commencing on the first Wednesday of June. The commission holds the results of public examinations carried out by the &quot;Intermediate Education Board for Ireland&quot; (1879-1924), these include the &quot;Junior Grade&quot;, &quot;Middle Grade&quot; and &quot;Senior Grade&quot;. A list of the department&#x27;s former examinations include:

<text>A Faraday rotator is a polarization rotator based on the Faraday effect, a magneto-optic effect involving transmission of light through a material when a longitudinal static magnetic field is present. The state of polarization (such as the axis of linear polarization or the orientation of elliptical polarization) is rotated as the wave traverses the device, which is explained by a slight difference in the phase velocity between the left and right circular polarizations. Thus it is an example of circular birefringence, as is optical activity, but involves a material only having this property in the presence of a magnetic field.

==Mechanism==
Circular birefringence, involving a difference in propagation between opposite circular polarizations, is distinct from linear birefringence (or simply birefringence, when the term is not further specified) which also transforms a wave&#x27;s polarization but not through a simple rotation.

The polarization state is rotated in proportion to the applied longitudinal magnetic field according to:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the angle of rotation (in radians), 
formula_3 is the magnetic flux density in the direction of propagation (in teslas), 
formula_4 is the length of the path (in metres) where the light and magnetic field interact, and 
formula_5 is the Verdet constant for the material. This empirical proportionality constant (in units of radians per tesla per metre, rad/(T·m)) varies with wavelength and temperature and is tabulated for various materials.

Faraday rotation is a rare example of non-reciprocal optical propagation. Although reciprocity is a basic tenet of electromagnetics, the &quot;apparent&quot; non-reciprocity in this case is a result of not considering the static magnetic field but only the resulting device. Unlike the rotation in an optically active medium such as a sugar solution, reflecting a polarized beam back through the same Faraday rotator does &quot;not&quot; undo the polarization change the beam underwent in its forward pass through the medium, but actually doubles it. Then by implementing a Faraday rotator with a rotation of 45°, inadvertent downstream reflections from a linearly polarized source will return with the polarization rotated by 90° and can be simply blocked by a polarizer; this is the basis of optical isolators used to prevent undesired reflections from disrupting an upstream optical system (particularly a laser).

The difference between Faraday rotation and other polarization rotation mechanisms is as follows. In an optically active medium, the polarization direction twists or rotates in the same sense (e.g. like a right-handed screw) for either direction, thus in the case of a plane reflection the original rotation is reversed, returning the incident beam to its original polarization. On the other hand, in a Faraday rotator, passage of light in opposite directions experience a magnetic field in &quot;opposite&quot; directions relative to the propagation direction, and since the rotation (relative to the direction of propagation) is determined by the magnetic field (see above equation), that rotation is opposite between the two propagating directions.

<text>Cadwallader Colden Washburn (April 22, 1818May 14, 1882) was an American businessman, politician, and soldier who founded a mill that later became General Mills. A member of the Washburn family of Maine, he was a U.S. congressman and governor of Wisconsin, and served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

==Education and early career==
Washburn was born in Livermore (in modern-day Maine, then a part of Massachusetts), the son of Martha (née Benjamin) and Israel Washburn Sr. He was one of seven brothers, who included Israel Washburn Jr., Elihu B. Washburne, William D. Washburn, and Charles Ames Washburn. Washburn attended school in Wiscasset, Maine, and later taught there in 1838–1839. In 1839 he moved to Davenport, Iowa Territory, where he taught school, worked in a store, and worked as a surveyor. Inspired by his brother Elihu who set up a legal practice in nearby Galena, Illinois, he studied law. In 1842 he was admitted to the Wisconsin bar and moved to Mineral Point, Iowa County, Wisconsin Territory, where he began a legal practice.

==Business==

===Land speculation and banking===
In 1844, Washburn formed a partnership with land agent Cyrus Woodman. Together the two men developed a number of companies, such as the Wisconsin Mining Company. The most successful business venture undertaken by the men was land acquisition. In May 1855 they established Washburn&#x27;s and Woodman&#x27;s Mineral Point Bank. Washburn and Woodman dissolved their partnership amicably in 1855.

===Minneapolis Mill Company===
In 1856, the Minneapolis Mill Company was chartered by the Minnesota territorial legislature. Among the incorporators were Washburn&#x27;s cousin Dorilus Morrison, and Robert Smith, an Illinois congressman who had acquired the rights to the water power at the west side of St. Anthony Falls in Minneapolis. The company struggled initially, and several of the early investors sold out. Washburn bought in and eventually became president. His brother William moved to Minneapolis about that time, and actively managed the company. The company built a dam, a canal and a complex set of water transfer tunnels which were then leased, along with land that the company owned at the foot of the falls, to a variety of mills – cotton mills, woolen mills, sawmills and grist/flour mills. Eventually the work and investment of the two brothers paid off well, and they used their new-found capital to invest in mills themselves.

===Lumber===
In 1853, Washburn built a mill at Waubeck on the Chippewa River. In 1859 Washburn moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin, and after his war time service, he engaged in a project to clear the Black River to make it easier to drive logs. In 1871 he formed the La Crosse Lumber Company, which eventually sawed 20,000,000 board feet of lumber annually. He also had the largest shingle mill in the upper Mississippi valley.

===Flour===
In 1866, he built his own Washburn &quot;B&quot; Mill, which was thought at the time to be too large to ever turn a profit. However, he succeeded and in 1874 built an even larger Washburn &quot;A&quot; Mill. The original &quot;A&quot; mill complex was destroyed, along with several nearby buildings, in a flour explosion in 1878, but was later rebuilt. In 1877, Washburn teamed with John Crosby to form the Washburn-Crosby Company. At the same time, Washburn sent William Hood Dunwoody to England to open that market for spring wheat. Successful, Dunwoody became a silent partner and went on to become one of the wealthiest millers in the world. Dunwoody became a philanthropist endowing hospitals, educational facilities which became Dunwoody College of Technology, and a charitable home which ultimately became Dunwoody Village. The corporation eventually became known as General Mills.

==Politics and military career==

In 1854, Washburn ran for Congress as a Republican, later serving three terms as part of the 34th, 35th and 36th United States Congresses representing Wisconsin&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, from March 4, 1855, to March 3, 1861. During the 34th Congress, he and his brothers voted for Nathaniel Banks during the protracted 1855-56 House of Representatives Speaker election. In his last term Washburn served as chairman of the Committee on Private Land Claims. He declined to run again in 1860.

The Washburn family had always been strongly opposed to slavery. Washburn moved to La Crosse, Wisconsin, in 1861 but returned to Washington, D.C., later that year as a delegate in the peace convention that was held in an attempt to prevent the American Civil War. He served in the Union Army during the Civil War, becoming colonel of the 2nd Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry, on February 6, 1862; brigadier general of Volunteers on July 16, 1862; and major general on November 29, 1862. Washburn had the honor of having his appointment document signed by President Abraham Lincoln. At one point Ulysses S. Grant called Washburn &quot;one of the best administrative officers we have.&quot; He commanded the cavalry of the XIII Corps in the opening stages of Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Vicksburg campaign. Once siege operations had begun against the city of Vicksburg and Grant called for all available forces, Washburn led a detachment of the XVI Corps during the siege of Vicksburg. He commanded the 1st Division in the XIII Corps in Nathanial P. Banks&#x27; operations along the Texas Coast leading the expedition against Fort Esperanza in November 1863.

For the rest of the war he served in administrative capacities in Mississippi and Tennessee. While commanding Union forces in Memphis, he was the target of an unsuccessful raid led by Nathan B. Forrest to kidnap him and other Union generals. He left the Union Army on May 25, 1865.

After the conclusion of the war, Washburn returned to his home in La Crosse, where he was elected again for two terms in the House of Representatives. This time he represented Wisconsin&#x27;s 6th congressional district at the 40th and 41st Congresses from March 4, 1867, to March 3, 1871, where he was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures on Public Buildings in the first term. He declined to run in 1870.

In 1871, he was urged to run for Governor of Wisconsin against James R. Doolittle. Washburn won the election and was inaugurated governor of Wisconsin on the first Monday in January 1872 and served from 1872 to 1874. He ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1873.

A year later, he purchased the Edgewood Villa estate from Samuel Marshall, where Edgewood College sits today.

==Family life==
Shortly after his birth in 1818, Washburn was diagnosed with epilepsy.

On January 1, 1849, New Years Day, he married Jeanette Garr, daughter of Andrew Sheffield Garr and Elizabeth Sinclair Garr. Both were 30-years-old at the time. The following year, the couple brought their first daughter, Jeanette (Nettie) Garr Washburn, into the world in 1850. After giving birth to Nettie her mother, Jeanette, started showing signs of mental illness. After Frances (Fanny) was born two years later, in 1852, Washburn made arrangements for his wife&#x27;s care at the Bloomingdale Asylum. Later she was transferred to an institution in Brookline, Massachusetts, where she remained until her death at the age of 90 in 1909.

==Later life==
Washburn donated the Edgewood Villa estate to the Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters of Madison, Wisconsin, in 1881. The Edgewood Villa later became Edgewood College and Edgewood High School. Nearly a year later, on May 14, 1882, he died in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, while on a visit to the springs for his health. His body was interred in Oak Grove Cemetery in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

After his death, his estate was valued at an estimated two to three million dollars. In his will, Cadwallader left money to his daughter and other members of his family. A large bequest was made to the city of La Crosse; land was bought and a building for the La Crosse Public Library erected. However, the largest portion was set aside to pay for the care of his wife, Jeanette.

==Legacy==
The city of Washburn in Bayfield County, Wisconsin, was named after Cadwallader Washburn, as were Washburn County in northern Wisconsin and the city of Washburn, North Dakota, As well as, Washburn Center for Children, and Washburn High School in Minneapolis. Washburn Observatory, at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, was also named for Washburn, who as governor, allocated the money for its construction. La Crosse, Wisconsin, where Washburn is laid to rest at his memorial in the Oak Grove Cemetery, has a downtown neighborhood and park named for the former governor and long time resident of the city.

<text>Paracheirodon is a genus of freshwater fish in the family Characidae of the order Characiformes. The type species is &quot;P. innesi,&quot; the well-known neon tetra, and the &quot;Paracheirodon&quot; species are among the fishes known as tetras. All species of this genus are native to the Neotropical realm, occurring in the Orinoco and Amazon Basins in northern South America.

&quot;Paracheirodon&quot; tetras reach maximum overall lengths of depending on the species, and are of elongated, tetra shapes. All share a distinctive iridescent blue lateral line, but differ slightly in their other colorations.

Preferring soft, acidic waters, these midwater shoaling fishes feed predominantly on small crustaceans, insects, worms, and zooplankton. When spawning, they scatter their eggs and guard neither eggs nor young.

The generic name &quot;Paracheirodon&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek χείρ (hand), and οδών (teeth), prefixed with παρά (beside) to distinguish it from the similar characin genus &quot;Cheirodon.&quot;

<doc id="549819" wikidata="Q4691830" url="?curid=549819" title="Age/sex/location">
<text>Age/sex/location (commonly referred to by the shorthand A/S/L, asl or ASL) is an article of Internet slang used in instant messaging programs and in Internet chatrooms. It is used in shorthand as a question to quickly find out the age, sex, and general location of the person with whom someone is interacting.

It is often asked as a question in romantic and sexual contexts online, but it may be used also to just get some defining characteristics of a user.

==Variations==
* A/S/L/P or ASLP are short for &quot;Age, Sex, Location, and Picture&quot;.
* NASL is short for &quot;Name, Age, Sex, Location&quot;.
* ASLNP (or written as &quot;A/S/L/N/P&quot;): &quot;Age/Sex/Location/Name/Picture&quot;.
* ASLR is short for &quot;age, sex, location, race&quot;.
* ASLRP is short for &quot;age, sex, location, race, picture&quot;.
* A/S is short for &quot;Age/Sex&quot;.
* A/S/L/M/H is short for &quot;Age, sex, location, music, hobbies&quot;.

==Criticism==

The fact that users often seek A/S/L information in &quot;initial interactions&quot; implies an &quot;emphasis on the physical body online&quot;. 52% of the MOO character descriptions referenced age, sex, location, or physical appearance.

<text>Hyperammonemia, or high ammonia levels, is a metabolic disturbance characterised by an excess of ammonia in the blood. Severe hyperammonemia is a dangerous condition that may lead to brain injury and death. It may be primary or secondary.

Ammonia is a substance that contains nitrogen. It is a product of the catabolism of protein. It is converted to the less toxic substance urea prior to excretion in urine by the kidneys. The metabolic pathways that synthesize urea involve reactions that start in the mitochondria and then move into the cytosol. The process is known as the urea cycle, which comprises several enzymes acting in sequence. It is greatly exacerbated by common zinc deficiency, which raises ammonia levels further.

==Levels==
Normal blood ammonia levels in adults range from 20 to 50μmol/L or less than 26 to 30μmol/L. There is at present no clear scientific consensus on the upper limits of ammonia levels for different age groups. In any case, hyperammonemia is generally defined as ammonia levels greater than 50μmol/L in adults and greater than 100μmol/L in newborns. These values should be considered as decision limits and the normal reference ranges of individual laboratories should be used for clinical interpretation.

When ammonia levels rise greater than 200μmol/L, serious symptoms, including seizures, encephalopathy, coma, and even death, can occur. Hyperammonemia with blood ammonia levels greater than 400 to 500μmol/L is associated with 5- to 10-fold higher risk of irreversible brain damage.

==Signs and symptoms==
===Complication===
Hyperammonemia is one of the metabolic derangements that contribute to hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause swelling of astrocytes and stimulation of NMDA receptors in the brain.

==Diagnosis==
===Types===
====Primary vs. secondary====
* Primary hyperammonemia is caused by several inborn errors of metabolism that are characterised by reduced activity of any of the enzymes in the urea cycle. The most common example is ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which is inherited in an X-linked fashion.
* Secondary hyperammonemia is caused by inborn errors of intermediary metabolism, which are characterised by reduced activity of enzymes that are not part of the urea cycle or dysfunction of cells that make major contributions to metabolism. Examples of the former are propionic acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia, and examples of the latter are acute liver failure and hepatic cirrhosis with liver failure.

====Acquired vs. congenital====
* Acquired hyperammonemia is usually caused by diseases that result in either acute liver failure, such as overwhelming hepatitis B or exposure to hepatotoxins, or cirrhosis of the liver with chronic liver failure. Chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, and excessive alcohol consumption are common causes of cirrhosis. The physiologic consequences of cirrhosis include shunting of blood from the liver to the inferior vena cava, resulting in decreased filtration of blood and removal of nitrogen-containing toxins by the liver, and then hyperammonemia. This type of hyperammonemia can be treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria that initially produce the ammonia, though this does not work as well as the removal of protein from the colon prior to its digestion to ammonia, achieved by lactulose administration for frequent (3-4 per day) bowel movements.
* Medication-induced hyperammonemia can occur with valproic acid overdose, and is due to a deficiency in carnitine. Its treatment is carnitine replacement.
* Urinary tract infection caused by urease-producing organisms (&quot;Proteus&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella&quot;, &quot;Morganella morganii&quot;, and &quot;Corynebacterium&quot;) can also lead to hyperammonemia. But there are case reports where hyperammonemia was caused by urease-negative organisms. Urease producers form ammonia and carbon dioxide from urea. Ammonia then enters the systemic circulation (most venous supply of the bladder bypasses portal circulation) and enters the blood–brain barrier causing encephalopathy.
* Severe dehydration and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth can also lead to acquired hyperammonemia.
* Glycine toxicity causes hyperammonemia, which manifests as CNS symptoms and nausea. Transient blindness can also occur.
* Congenital hyperammonemia is usually due to genetic defects in one of the enzymes of the urea cycle, such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which leads to lower production of urea from ammonia.

====Specific types====
The following list includes such examples:
* - hyperammonemia due to ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency
* - hyperinsulinism-hyperammonemia syndrome (glutamate dehydrogenase 1)
* - hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinuria syndrome
* - hyperammonemia due to N-Acetylglutamate synthase deficiency
* - hyperammonemia due to carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency (carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I)
* - hyperlysinuria with hyperammonemia (genetics unknown)
* Methylmalonic acidemia
* Isovaleric acidemia
* Propionic acidemia
* Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency
* Transient hyperammonemia of the newborn, specifically in the preterm

==Treatment==
Treatment centres on limiting intake of ammonia and increasing its excretion. Dietary protein, a metabolic source of ammonium, is restricted, and caloric intake is provided by glucose and fat. Intravenous arginine (argininosuccinase deficiency), sodium phenylbutyrate and sodium benzoate (ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency) are pharmacologic agents commonly used as adjunctive therapy to treat hyperammonemia in patients with urea cycle enzyme deficiencies. Sodium phenylbutyrate and sodium benzoate can serve as alternatives to urea for the excretion of waste nitrogen. Phenylbutyrate, which is the product of phenylacetate, conjugates with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys. Similarly, sodium benzoate reduces ammonia content in the blood by conjugating with glycine to form hippuric acid, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys. A preparation containing sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate is available under the trade name Ammonul.
Acidification of the intestinal lumen using lactulose can decrease ammonia levels by protonating ammonia and trapping it in the stool. This is a treatment for hepatic encephalopathy.

Treatment of severe hyperammonemia (serum ammonia levels greater than 1000 μmol/L) should begin with hemodialysis if it is otherwise medically appropriate and tolerated.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is a remarkably effective mode of therapy in neonatal hyperammonemia, particularly in severe cases of Urea cycle defects like Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC) deficiency. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration is required to optimize this advanced treatment. Simulation training might be the best training and teaching strategy to ensure MDT successful therapy.

<text>Whakatāne ( , ) is a town located in the Bay of Plenty Region in the North Island of New Zealand, east of Tauranga and northeast of Rotorua. The town is situated at the mouth of the Whakatāne River. The Whakatāne District is the territorial authority that encompasses the town, covering an area to the south and west of the town, excluding the enclave of Kawerau District.

Whakatāne has an urban population of , making it New Zealand&#x27;s 33rd-largest urban area and the Bay of Plenty&#x27;s third-largest urban area, after Tauranga and Rotorua. Another people live in the rest of the Whakatāne District. Around 42% of the population identify as having Māori ancestry, and 66% as having European/Pākehā ancestry, compared with 17% and 72% nationally (some people identify with multiple ethnicities).

Whakatāne is part of the parliamentary electorate of East Coast, currently represented by Dana Kirkpatrick of the New Zealand National Party. The town is the main urban centre of the eastern Bay of Plenty sub-region, which includes Whakatāne, Kawerau, and Ōpōtiki, stretching from Otamarakau in the west to Cape Runaway in the northeast and Whirinaki in the south. Whakatāne is also the seat of the Bay of Plenty Regional Council, which was chosen as a compromise between the region&#x27;s two larger cities, Tauranga and Rotorua.

===Māori occupation===
The site of the town has long been populated. Māori pā (Māori fortified village) sites in the area date back to the first Polynesian settlements, estimated to have been around 1200 CE. According to Māori tradition Toi-te-huatahi, later known as Toi-kai-rakau, landed at Whakatāne about 1150 CE in search of his grandson Whatonga. Failing to find Whatonga, he settled in the locality and built a pa on the highest point of the headland now called Whakatāne Heads, overlooking the present town. Some 200 years later the &quot;Mātaatua&quot; waka landed at Whakatāne.

The Maori name is reputed to commemorate an incident occurring after the arrival of the &quot;Mataatua&quot;. The men had gone ashore and the canoe began to drift. Wairaka, a chieftainess, said &quot;Kia whakatāne au i ahau&quot; (&quot;I will act like a man&quot;), and commenced to paddle – something that women were not allowed to do. With the help of the other women, the canoe was saved. Wairaka&#x27;s efforts are commemorated by a bronze statue of her at the mouth of the Whakatāne River, which was installed in 1965.
The region around Whakatāne was important during the New Zealand Wars of the mid-19th century, particularly the Völkner incident. Its role culminated in 1869 with raids by Te Kooti&#x27;s forces and a number of its few buildings were razed, leading to an armed constabulary being stationed above the town for a short while. Whakatāne beach heralded a historic meeting on 23 March 1908 between Prime Minister Joseph Ward and the Māori prophet and activist Rua Kenana Hepetipa. Kenana claimed to be Te Kooti&#x27;s successor.

===European settlement===

The town was a notable shipbuilding and trade centre from 1880 and with the draining of the Rangitāiki swamp into productive farmland from 1904, Whakatāne grew considerably. In the early 1920s, it was the fastest-growing town in the country for a period of about three years and this saw the introduction of electricity for the first time. The carton board mill at Whakatāne began as a small operation in 1939 and continues operating to this day.

The Whakatāne River once had a much longer and more circuitous route along the western edge of the Whakatāne urban area, having been significantly re-coursed in the 1960s with a couple of its loopier loops removed to help prevent flooding and provide for expansion of the town. Remnants of the original watercourse remain as Lake Sullivan and the Awatapu lagoon. The original wide-span ferro-concrete bridge constructed in 1911 at the (aptly named) Bridge Street was demolished in 1984 and replaced by the Landing Road bridge.
Whakatāne has in recent years benefited from its relative dominance over numerous smaller and less prosperous towns surrounding it, such as Te Teko (affectionately known as &#x27;Texas&#x27;) and Waimana, and its popularity as a retirement and lifestyle destination.

===Mataatua Declaration===
The &#x27;First International Conference on the Cultural and Intellectual Property Rights of Indigenous Peoples&#x27; was held in Whakatāne from 12 to 18 June 1993. This resulted in the Mataatua Declaration on Cultural and Intellectual Property Rights of Indigenous Peoples&#x27;, commonly referred to as the Mataatua Declaration.

===Marae===

Whakatāne has five marae, which are meeting places for Ngāti Awa hapū:
* Te Hokowhitu a Tū ki te Rāhui Marae and Te Hokowhitu a Tūmatauenga meeting house is affiliated with Ngāti Wharepaia and Ngāti Hokopū – Te Hokowhitu a Tu Ki Te Rāhui.
* Te Rangihouhiri II Marae and Te Rangihouhiri II meeting house is affiliated with Ngāi Te Rangihouhiri II.
* Tokitareke or Warahoe Marae and Te Puna o Te Orohi meeting house is affiliated with Warahoe.
* Toroa or Pupuaruhe Marae and Toroa meeting house is affiliated with Te Patuwai.
* Te Whare o Toroa Marae and Wairaka meeting house is affiliated with Ngāti Wharepaia and Ngāti Hokopū – Te Whare o Toroa.

In October 2020, the Government committed from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrading Te Hokowhitu a Tū ki te Rāhui Marae and 11 other Ngāti Awa marae, creating 23 jobs. It also committed $282,275 to upgrade Te Whare o Toroa Marae, creating an estimated 21 jobs.

==Geography==

Moutohora Island is a small island off the Bay of Plenty coast about north of Whakatāne. The island has numerous sites of pā. It also provided shelter for James Cook&#x27;s &quot;Endeavour&quot; in 1769. A whaling station existed on the island during the 19th century.

Whakaari/White Island is an active marine volcano located 48 kilometres (25 n.mi.) offshore of Whakatāne and was a popular visitor attraction. Sulphur mining on the island was attempted but abandoned in 1914 after a lahar killed all 10 workers.

The mouth of the Whakatāne River and Ohiwa Harbour have both provided berths for yachts, fishing trawlers and small ships since European settlement of the area. Nearby Ōhope Beach is a sandy beach stretching from the Ohiwa Harbour entrance.

===Climate===

Whakatāne has frequently recorded the highest annual sunshine hours in New Zealand (year and respective sunshine hours shown below). Since official recording began in 2008, the town has frequently attained upwards of 2600 hours a year. The town recorded an average of over 7.5hrs of sunshine a day in 2013. Whakatāne also records the national daily high (temp) on approximately 55 days of the year.

===Natural disasters===
Whakatāne was affected by the 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake. Heavy rain struck the Bay of Plenty region between 16 and 18 July 2004, resulting in severe flooding and a state of civil emergency being declared. Many homes and properties were flooded, forcing thousands of Whakatāne residents to evacuate. The Rangitaiki River burst its banks, flooding large areas of farmland, and numerous roads were closed by floods and slips. A total of 245.8 mm (9&quot;) of rain fell in Whakatāne in the 48-hour period and many small earthquakes were also felt during this time, loosening the sodden earth and resulting in landslips that claimed two lives.

Whakatane is also the closest town to Whakaari / White Island, which experienced a fatal eruption in 2019. The town was heavily affected by the disaster in which 22 lost their lives.

==Industries and tourism==
The town&#x27;s main industries are diverse: forestry, tourism, agriculture, horticulture, fishing and manufacturing are all well-established. There is a large carton board packaging mill, a newspaper press, and a brewery.

While farming and forestry activities remain the dominant sectors, tourism is a growing industry for Whakatāne, with a continued increase in guest nights in the district. White Island is a key attraction. Popular tourist activities include the beaches, swimming with dolphins, whale watching, chartered fishing cruises, surf tours, amateur astronomy, hunting, experiences of Maori culture and bush walking. Whakatāne is also used as a base for many tourists who wish to explore other activities in the surrounding region.

Aquaculture is an emerging industry for the Eastern Bay, with the development of a 3800 hectare (15 sq. mi.) marine farm 8.5 km (4 n.mi.) offshore of Ōpōtiki, expected to produce 20,000 tonnes of mussels per annum by 2025 and add $35 million to regional GDP. Whakatāne is home to the regional radio station One Double X – 1XX – one of the first privately owned commercial radio stations on air in New Zealand in the early 1970s.

Whakatāne has become the dominant commercial service centre for the Eastern Bay. In 2006, a large-format shopping centre (The Hub Whakatane) was built on the edge of town anchored by national chains Bunnings Warehouse and Harvey Norman. Its retail space totals 24,000sqm (6 acres) and includes 900 car parks. Prior to the centre&#x27;s construction, it was estimated around $30 million in local retail spending was being lost to large format retail stores in neighbouring Tauranga and Rotorua.

Whakatāne Museum, a local museum operating across two premises with changing exhibitions, opened in 1972.

== Infrastructure ==

Whakatane Airport is served by Air Chathams with direct flights to Auckland using Saab 340 aircraft. Air New Zealand previously operated the Auckland service until April 2015.
Private cars, limited public transport and taxis (as well as cycling and walking) are the primary modes of transport for residents.

Whakatāne sits at the eastern end of State Highway 30. State Highway 2 bypasses the urban area.

=== Bus ===
Baybus runs between Whakatāne and Ōhope. Furthermore, once-daily return bus services operate to Tauranga, en route from Kawerau and Ōpōtiki on alternate weekdays. Bee Cards were introduced for fares on 27 July 2020.

===Marine===

Coastal trading, including scows and steamships – notably the Northern Steamship Company service, which ran until 1959, used Whakatāne as a port of call. Today it primarily services charter vessels, commercial &amp; recreational fishing vessels. The depth of water over the Whakatāne River entrance has been a limiting factor to the development of better port facilities, but it is generally held that a training wall along the western edge of the entrance would allow greater depths and safer crossings.

===Rail===
A passenger train called the Taneatua Express ran on the East Coast Main Trunk Railway (ECMT) as far as Taneatua until 1959. The Taneatua Branch line was formerly part of the ECMT and connected with the current ECMT at Hawkens Junction.

A private railway line operated by Whakatane Board Mills (now Carter Holt Harvey Whakatāne) formerly connected the company&#x27;s mill on the western side of the river to the Taneatua Branch line at Awakeri. The Whakatane Board Mills Line was freight only, with no passenger service. In 1999 operation of the Whakatane Board Mills line was taken over by Tranz Rail (now KiwiRail) and the line was renamed the Whakatane Industrial line. The line has since been closed and lifted, and the Taneatua Branch line is used for tourist excursions.

<text>Sergei Nikitich Khrushchev (; 2 July 1935 – 18 June 2020) was a Soviet-born American engineer and the second son of the Cold War-era Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev with his wife Nina Petrovna Khrushcheva. He moved to the United States in 1991 and became a naturalized American citizen.

He was a jury member of the Rainer Hildebrandt international human rights award.

==Career==
Khrushchev held several advanced engineering degrees. From the Bauman Moscow State Technical University he earned his doctoral degree, and he earned a Ph.D. from the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. In addition, he earned an M.S. degree with distinction from the Moscow Power Engineering Institute. He also held an &quot;occasional&quot; professorship at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, meaning he was not a full-time professor (though he was for some time), but did teach there fairly often.

Prior to emigrating from the Soviet Union to the United States in 1991, Khrushchev worked in various high-level engineering positions. From 1968 to 1991, he served at the Control Computer Institute in Moscow, where he rose from section head to first deputy director in charge of research. From the years 1958 to 1968, Dr. Khrushchev worked as an engineer, then later as a deputy section head in charge of guidance systems for missile and space design. In this capacity, he worked on cruise missiles for submarine craft, military and research spacecraft, Moon vehicles, and the Proton space booster.

He often spoke to American audiences to share his memories of the &quot;other&quot; side of the Cold War. He told &quot;Scientific American&quot; that he had tried to see the Apollo 11 Moon landing through a telescope from Ukraine with a KGB officer. Khrushchev served as an advisor to The Cold War Museum. He was a Senior Fellow at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University.

== Personal life ==
Khrushchev moved to the United States with his wife Valentina from the Soviet Union in 1991, to teach at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.

On 12 July 1999, Khrushchev and his wife, Valentina, became citizens of the United States through naturalization. Pronouncing &quot;This is a great country and it&#x27;s an honor to live here.&#x27; at the citizenship ceremony. He retained his Russian citizenship, becoming a dual citizen. Khrushchev waited more than the required five years of living in the U.S, fearful his U.S Citizenship would restrict visits to see his extended family. His three sons and three grandchildren still live in Moscow.

His son from a previous marriage, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, a Russian journalist, died on 22 February 2007, aged 47, from a stroke.

== Death ==
Khrushchev died on 18 June 2020, at his home in Cranston, Rhode Island, at age 84, by suicide. The cause of death, as certified by the Rhode Island medical examiner&#x27;s office, was a gunshot wound to the head. Cranston, Rhode Island police Major Todd Patalano said there were no signs of foul play, and the investigation by the police into his death was closed with no criminal charges filed on anyone.

<doc id="549842" wikidata="Q480281" url="?curid=549842" title="Amto–Musan languages">
<text>Amto–Musan is a language family of two closely related but mutually unintelligible Papuan languages, Amto and Siawi, spoken along the Samaia River of Sandaun Province of Papua New Guinea.

==Languages==
Foley (2018) and Usher (2020) agree that the family consists of two languages.

;Amto–Musan / Samaia River family
*Amto (Ki)
*Musan (Musian, Siawi)

==External relationships==
Amto–Musan was left unclassified by Ross (2005) (see Papuan languages#Ross (2005)) due to lack of data; Wurm (1975) had posited it as an independent family. The family has typological similarities with the Busa language isolate, but these do not appear to demonstrate a genetic relationship.

Timothy Usher links the Amto–Musan languages to their neighbors, the Arai languages and the Pyu language in as Arai–Samaia stock.

Foley (2018) classifies them separately as an independent language family. Foley also notes that due to heavy contact and trade with Left May languages, Amto–Musan languages have borrowed much cultural vocabulary from Left May.

==Cognates==
Amto-Musan family cognates listed by Foley (2018):

Possible cognates between the Amto-Musan and Left May families:

Possible loanwords reflecting the close trade relationship between Amto-Musan and Left May speakers:
*‘arrow’ Amto &quot;lamu&quot;, Musan &quot;namu&quot;, Ama &quot;lamu&quot;
*‘stone’: Amto &quot;tabeki&quot;, Musan &quot;tipeki&quot;, Bo &quot;təpəki&quot;, Ama &quot;tomoki&quot;

==Vocabulary comparison==
The following basic vocabulary words are from Conrad &amp; Dye (1975), as cited in the Trans-New Guinea database:

The words cited constitute translation equivalents, whether they are cognate (e.g. &quot;tipeki&quot;, &quot;ʌbɛki&quot; for “stone”) or not (e.g. &quot;twæ&quot;, &quot;nani&quot; for “head”).

<doc id="549843" wikidata="Q33253" url="?curid=549843" title="Benue–Congo languages">
<text>Benue–Congo (sometimes called East Benue–Congo) is a major branch of the Volta-Congo languages which covers most of Sub-Saharan Africa.

==Subdivisions==
Central Nigerian (or Platoid) contains the Plateau, Jukunoid and Kainji families, and Bantoid–Cross combines the Bantoid and Cross River groups.

Bantoid is only a collective term for every subfamily of Bantoid–Cross except Cross River, and this is no longer seen as forming a valid branch, however one of the subfamilies, Southern Bantoid, is still considered valid. It is Southern Bantoid which contains the Bantu languages, which are spoken across most of Sub-Saharan Africa. This makes Benue–Congo one of the largest subdivisions of the Niger–Congo language family, both in number of languages, of which &quot;Ethnologue&quot; counts 976 (2017), and in speakers, numbering perhaps 350 million. Benue–Congo also includes a few minor isolates in the Nigeria–Cameroon region, but their exact relationship is uncertain.

The neighbouring Volta–Niger branch of Nigeria and Benin is sometimes called &quot;West Benue–Congo&quot;, but it does not form a united branch with Benue–Congo. When Benue–Congo was first proposed by Joseph Greenberg (1963), it included Volta–Niger (as West Benue–Congo); the boundary between Volta–Niger and Kwa has been repeatedly debated. Blench (2012) states that if Benue–Congo is taken to be &quot;the noun-class languages east and north of the Niger&quot;, it is likely to be a valid group, though no demonstration of this has been made in print.The branches of the Benue–Congo family are thought to be as follows:
*Bantoid–Cross languages
** Cross River
**Northern Bantoid
**Southern Bantoid
* Central Nigerian languages, also known as Platoid
** Jukunoid
** Kainji
** Plateau

Ukaan is also related to Benue–Congo; Roger Blench suspects it might be either the most divergent (East) Benue–Congo language or the closest relative to Benue–Congo.

Fali of Baissa and Tita are also Benue–Congo but are otherwise unclassified.

==Branches and locations (Nigeria)==
Below is a list of major Benue–Congo branches and their primary locations (centres of diversity) within Nigeria based on Blench (2019).

<doc id="549847" wikidata="Q882676" url="?curid=549847" title="Green neon tetra">
<text>The green neon tetra (Paracheirodon simulans) is a freshwater fish of the family Characidae of order Characiformes. It is native to the upper Orinoco and Negro Rivers in South America.

This fish is similar in appearance to the closely related and better-known neon tetra, but it is slightly smaller, and its red patch is less pronounced, while the blue-green areas of the upper body are more brilliant. Also, its body is slimmer than that of the neon tetra. It grows to a maximum overall length of about .

Like the other &quot;Paracheirodon&quot; species, the green neon tetra is kept as an aquarium fish, but it is less commonly seen than either the neon tetra or the cardinal tetra.

&quot;P. simulans&quot; is also sometimes called the blue or false neon. &quot;Hyphessobrycon simulans&quot; and &quot;Cheirodon simulans&quot; are obsolete synonyms.
This fish loses its brilliant blue and red colors when lights are switched off, but regains them when lights are switched on again. The green neon tetra comes from extremely soft, acidic water at temperatures around .

==Breeding==

For breeding, these tetras need water similar to the waters in which they live in the wild; extremely soft water with a pH of about 6 and a temperature of around . Ideally, the water should be highly stained by the tannins from peat, in subdued light, shaded by plants. It spawns in a school, although in the actual act of spawning, one female may be closely associated with one or more males.

About 130 eggs a batch can be laid by each female. The parents should be removed after spawning. The eggs should hatch in 24 hours. The eggs are light sensitive so avoid light(?). The babies are very small, so feeding infusoria (protozoa) is necessary early on. As they grow, this can increasingly be supplemented with fine commercial fry foods. Adults can breed again after a few weeks.

<text>&quot;Lead, Kindly Light, Amid the encircling gloom&quot; is a hymn with words written in 1833 by John Henry Newman as a poem titled &quot;the Pillar of the Cloud&quot;, which was first published in the &quot;British Magazine&quot; in 1834&quot;,&quot; and republished in &quot;Lyra Apostolica&quot; in 1836. 

==History==

As a young priest, Newman became sick while in Italy and was unable to travel for almost three weeks. In his &quot;Apologia Pro Vita Sua&quot;, Newman described the writing thus:

==Tune==
The first musical setting of &quot;Lead, Kindly Light&quot; was published in &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot; in 1868, set to the hymn tune &quot;Lux Benigna&quot;, specially composed for the hymn by John Bacchus Dykes. Newman ascribed the popularity of the hymn to Dykes&#x27; tune. The hymn was later set to the tune &quot;Bonifacio&quot; by David Evans. When the hymn was republished in the 1931 edition of &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;, it was set to a tune by William Henry Harris entitled &quot;Alberta&quot;, which he had composed in 1924 on a train crossing Canada. The theologian David Brown notes that &quot;Lux Benigna&quot; has been criticised for its Victorian sentimentality, and that Dykes&#x27; once-popular tune has fallen out of favour, while Harris&#x27;s &quot;Alberta&quot; has gained popularity.

Other popular settings of the hymn include Charles H. Purday&#x27;s tune &quot;Sandon&quot;, composed in 1860, and Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s tune, &quot;Lux in Tenebris&quot;, which Ian Bradley praises as a &quot;much more sensitive and honest setting of Newman&#x27;s ambiguity and expressions of doubt&quot; than Dykes&#x27;s &quot;steady, reassuring&quot; rhythms.

&quot;Lead, Kindly Light&quot; has also been set as a choral anthem by Sir John Stainer (1886).

==Notable occasions relating to hymn==

The largest mining disaster in the Durham Coalfield in England was at West Stanley Colliery, known locally as &quot;The Burns Pit&quot;, when 168 men and boys lost their lives as the result of two underground explosions at 3:45pm on Tuesday 16 February 1909. In the Towneley Seam 63 lay dead, in the Tilley Seam 18 lay dead, in the Busty Seam 33 lay dead and in the Brockwell Seam 48 lay dead. But incredibly, there were still men alive underground. A group of 34 men and boys in the Tilley Seam had found a pocket of clean air. They were led by Deputy Mark Henderson. A few of them panicked and left the group, they died instantly after inhaling the poison gas. The remainder sat in almost total darkness, when one of them began humming the Hymn &quot;Lead Kindly Light&quot;. In no time at all, the rest of the miners joined in with the words, &quot;Lead kindly light amidst the encircling gloom, lead thou me on, The night is dark, and I am far from home&quot;. This was probably sung to the tune &quot;Sandon&quot; by C. H. Purday, popular with miners in the Durham coalfield. Before the hymn ended, young Jimmy Gardner died of injuries. These 26 men were rescued after 14 hours, four others were later rescued.

&quot;Lead, Kindly Light&quot; was sung by Betsie ten Boom, sister of Corrie ten Boom, and other women as they were led by the S.S. Guards to the Ravensbrück concentration camp during the Holocaust.

&quot;Lead, Kindly Light&quot; was sung by a soloist, Marion Wright, on the &quot;RMS Titanic&quot; during a hymn-singing gathering led by the Rev. Ernest C. Carter, shortly before the ocean liner struck an iceberg on April 14, 1912. The hymn was also sung aboard one of the &quot;Titanic&quot;&#x27;s lifeboats when the rescue ship &quot;Carpathia&quot; was sighted the following morning. It was suggested by one of the occupants, Noëlle, Countess of Rothes.

On one occasion in February 1915, &quot;Lead, Kindly Light&quot; was sung by a group of British troops to the accompaniment of nearby artillery fire on the Western Front during the First World War at services held before going into the trenches the following day.

Since 1922, the hymn &quot;Lead, Kindly Light&quot; is still sung in the morning of famous SB College Changanassery in Kerala which is said to halt everyone in the region, from their work. It is also the motto for the Cambridge High School, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; Our Own English High School, United Arab Emirates; The Little Flower Higher Secondary School, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India; Soundararaja Vidyalaya, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India; Mangalam College of Engineering, Ettumanoor, Kerala, India; St. Thomas Public School, Pune, Maharashtra, India; Sri Kumaran Children&#x27;s Home, Bangalore, Karnataka, India and for De Paul School, Kuravilangad, Kerala (Malayalam translation).

The hymn is referred to in Chapter LVI titled &#x27;Beauty in Loneliness – After All&#x27; from Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novel &quot;Far From The Madding Crowd&quot;.

The hymn was also a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi and is mentioned at the Gandhi Museum in Madurai, Tamil Nadu.

It was the favourite hymn of Percy French (1854–1920), who died suddenly in January 1920 at the home of his cousin in Formby, England. He was on his way back to his family after a final entertainment in Glasgow. These lines from &quot;Lead Kindly Light&quot; are etched on his grave in Saint Luke&#x27;s Church, Formby:
:So long thy power hath blessed me
:Sure it still will lead me on,
:O&#x27;er moor and fen, o&#x27;er crag and torrent;
:Till the night is gone.

==Lyrics==
===Pirate Verse===
Edward Henry Bickersteth (later Bishop of Exeter) added a fourth &#x27;pirate verse&#x27; for the poem&#x27;s republication in the &quot;Hymnal Companion&quot; in 1870. It reads:

:Meantime, along the narrow rugged path,
:Thyself hast trod,
:Lead, Saviour, lead me home in childlike faith,
:Home to my God.
:To rest forever after earthly strife
:In the calm light of everlasting life.

Newman was not pleased, writing to the publishers: &quot;It is not that the verse is not both in sentiment and language graceful and good, but I think you will at once see how unwilling an author must be to subject himself to the inconvenience of that being ascribed to him which is not his own.&quot; This verse is not usually included in modern printings of the hymn.

<text>CPM 22 is a Brazilian hardcore band from São Paulo formed in 1995. Band members are Badauí (vocals), Luciano (guitar), Phil (guitar), Ali (bass) and Daniel (drums).

== History ==
With influences from the Ramones, the Misfits, Buzzcocks, Face to Face, Pennywise, Green Day, and other old school punk and hardcore legends, CPM 22 recorded their first demo tape in 1998.

Their popularity in the Brazilian underground scene led CPM 22 to record the independent album &quot;A Alguns Quilômetros de Lugar Algum&quot; (&quot;A Few Kilometers From Nowhere&quot;). Two years later they were included in the Brazilian MTV video-music award in the demo clip category with &quot;Anteontem&quot; (&quot;The Day Before Yesterday&quot;).

In 2001, they signed with Abril Music and released their first mainstream album called &quot;CPM 22&quot; with many hits, including &quot;Regina, Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, &quot;Tarde de Outubro&quot; (&quot;October Afternoon&quot;) and &quot;O Mundo Dá Voltas&quot; (&quot;The World Turns&quot;), playing on Brazilian radios.

At the end of 2002, they released &quot;Chegou a Hora de Recomeçar&quot; (&quot;Now&#x27;s The Time To Start Over&quot;). CPM 22 reached the top of their popularity in Brazil with songs including &quot;Desconfio&quot; (&quot;I Suspect&quot;), &quot;Ontem&quot; (&quot;Yesterday&quot;), &quot;Não Sei Viver Sem Ter Você&quot; (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Live Without You&quot;), &quot;Dias Atrás&quot; (&quot;Days Ago&quot;), and &quot;Atordoado&quot; (&quot;Stunned&quot;).

On 13 July 2022, World Rock Day, the band released the song &quot;Tudo Vale a Pena?&quot; (Is Everything Worth It?), co-composed and co-written by Sérgio Britto, vocalist and keyboardist of Titãs. The track was produced by members Luciano, Philippe and Ali.

<doc id="549861" wikidata="Q2174970" url="?curid=549861" title="U.S. Route 183">
<text>U.S. Route 183 (US 183) is a north–south United States highway. The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in Presho, South Dakota, at an intersection with Interstate 90. Its southern terminus is in Refugio, Texas, at the southern intersection of U.S. Highway 77 and Alternate US 77 (US 183 and Alt US 77 run concurrently for their final between Cuero and Refugio).

US 183 was the last U.S. Route to be completely paved. The segment in Loup County, Nebraska, north of Taylor, was unpaved until 1967.

==Route description==

===Texas===

US-183 begins in Refugio, sharing a concurrency (road) with US-77A. The two highways continue north through Goliad County until they split in DeWitt County. US-183 crosses I-10 south of the town of Luling.

The largest city that US-183 passes through is Austin, Texas, where it is mostly a limited access highway. Northwest of Austin, US-183 passes through the suburbs of Cedar Park and Leander, where the 183A toll road runs parallel to it. In Lampasas County, US-183 overlaps US-190 between the towns of Lampasas and Lometa.

US-183 overlaps US-84 from Goldthwaite in Mills County to Early in Brown County. It crosses I-20 in Cisco, Texas. US-183 overlaps US-283 in Throckmorton County, and both highways overlaps US-277 and US-82 in Baylor County from Seymour to Mabelle. In Wilbarger County, US-183 exits the concurrency with US-283 and turns east with US-70 to overlap US-287 between the towns of Vernon and Oklaunion. US-183 continues north overlapping US-70 until it leaves the state of Texas.

===Oklahoma===

US 183/US 70 enters Oklahoma by crossing the Red River south of Davidson, OK. In Davidson, US 70 splits from US 183, leaving US 183 on its own.
This continues as US 183 passes US 62 and BUS 62 in Snyder, OK. About north of Snyder, US 183 crosses Interstate 40 at Interstate 40&#x27;s exit 66.
Another later, US 183 co-signs with US 270 near Seiling, OK. US 183/US 270 continue in a northwesterly direction for before picking up US 412 in Woodward, OK.
US 183/US 270/US 412 then leave Woodward in a due west fashion for a short time, until heading northwest again for , at which time US 270 and US 412 leave US 183 near Fort Supply, OK to form their own duplex through the panhandle of Oklahoma as US 270/US 412.
US 183 then continues north from the southern Harper County line to the Oklahoma/Kansas state line for a total of about before leaving the state.

=== Kansas ===

US-183 enters Kansas in Clark County and turns east at Sitka, where it begins a concurrency with US-160, entering Comanche County, where it passes through Protection. The highways stay paired as it turns north to pass through the Comanche County seat, Coldwater. At Coldwater, US-160 turns back to the east, and US-183 continues its northerly track.
Entering Kiowa County, US-183 reaches a junction with the overlapped east–west route, US-54 and US-400, where it passes through Greensburg. In southern Edwards County, the highway makes a brief turn to the west before meeting up with US-56 in Kinsley, the Edwards County seat. US-56 and US-183 turn northeast before the highways split after entering Pawnee County. US-56 continues northeast toward Larned, and US-183 straightens out to pass through largely unpopulated areas in Edwards County.

In Rush County, US-183 intersects two primary east–west Kansas state highways, K-96 in Rush Center and K-4 in LaCrosse.

US-183 reaches the largest city along its route in Kansas, Hays, where a western bypass of the highway provides direct access to Gross Memorial Coliseum and Fort Hays State University. US-183 is known as Vine Street in Hays and contains numerous businesses. US-183 runs through town for three miles (5 km) before crossing Interstate 70, which is heavily traveled in Hays with traffic between Denver and Kansas City. The interchange of US-183 and I-70 has been designated as the CW2 Bryan J. Nichols Fallen Veterans Memorial Interchange.

North of Hays, the highway has been resurfaced and realigned for to Plainville, one of two towns in Rooks County US-183 serves. At Plainville, US-183 has a junction with K-18. US-183 continues north to Stockton, the Rooks County seat, where US-24 crosses.

The highway enters Phillips County approximately north of Stockton. US-183 meets US-36 west, and the highways join for a concurrency through the city of Phillipsburg. The highways split in downtown Phillipsburg, and US-183 has one last junction with K-383 before exiting the state south of Alma, Nebraska.

US-183 is two-laned throughout Kansas, except for the portion which runs through Hays.

===Nebraska===
U.S. Highway 183 enters Nebraska south of Alma. It enters Alma after crossing Harlan County Lake and the Republican River and then runs concurrent with U.S. Highway 136 north out of Alma. After separating from US 136, US 183 continues north to Holdrege, where it intersects U.S. Highway 6 and U.S. Highway 34. US 183 continues north from Holdrege and intersects Interstate 80 south of Elm Creek shortly after crossing the Platte River. It then proceeds north into Elm Creek and meets U.S. Highway 30. US 183 continues north through Miller and intersects Nebraska Highway 2 at Ansley. It continues north from Ansley through Sargent, Taylor, and Rose before meeting U.S. Highway 20 in Bassett. At Bassett, US 183 turns west with US 20 before turning north again near Long Pine. US 183 continues north through Springview before entering South Dakota.

===South Dakota===
U.S. Highway 183 enters South Dakota just south of Wewela. It goes north to Colome, where it intersects U.S. Route 18. US 183 and US 18 pass concurrently northwest through Winner, then US 183 turns north, west of Winner. Route 183 goes north to Presho, where it intersects Interstate 90 and ends.

Legally, the South Dakota section of U.S. 183, with the exception of a concurrency with U.S. 18, is defined at South Dakota Codified Laws § 31-4-202.
==History==

When the route was first commissioned in 1930, it traveled from near Selden, Kansas to North Platte, Nebraska. This route is now part of US 83.

From 1932 until I-90 was built in the 1960s, US 183&#x27;s northern terminus was further west, in Vivian, South Dakota at an intersection with its parent, US 83. In 1940, the southern terminus was extended south to Junction, Texas. It was extended to its present endpoint in 1951. In 1952, it was rerouted between Throckmorton and Cisco, Texas, replacing part of SH 6 and SH 187.

<text>Sirenik Yupik, Sireniki Yupik (also Old Sirenik or Vuteen), Sirenik, or Sirenikskiy is an extinct Eskimo–Aleut language. It was spoken in and around the village of Sireniki (Сиреники) in Chukotka Peninsula, Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, Russia. The language shift has been a long process, ending in total language death. In January 1997, the last native speaker of the language, a woman named Vyjye (Valentina Wye) (), died. Ever since that point, the language has been extinct; nowadays, all Sirenik Eskimos speak Siberian Yupik or Russian. Despite this, censuses as late as 2010 report up to 5 native speakers of Sirenik.

Сиӷы́ных is the endonym for the eponymous settlement of Sireniki. The endonym for the people itself is &quot;Sirenikites&quot;; the singular form is .

This article is based on Menovschikov (1964), with cited examples transliterated from Cyrillic transcription to the International Phonetic Alphabet.

== Classification ==

=== Genealogical ===

==== External ====
Some argue that the Sirenik language is a remnant of a third group of Eskimo languages, in addition to Yupik and Inuit groups (see a visual representation by tree and an argumentation based on comparative linguistics). In fact, the exact genealogical classification of Sireniki language is not settled yet, and some others regard it belonging to the Yupik branch.

Many words are formed from entirely different roots to those in Siberian Yupik. Also, the grammar has several peculiarities compared to other Eskimo languages, and even compared to Aleut. For example, dual number is not known in Sireniki Eskimo, while most Eskimo–Aleut languages have dual, including even its neighboring Siberian Yupik relatives. The peculiarities amounted to mutual unintelligibility with even its nearest language relatives. This forced Sirenik Eskimos to use Chukchi as a lingua franca when speaking with neighboring Eskimo peoples. Thus, any external contacts required using a different language for Sireniki Eskimos: they either resorted to use of lingua franca, or used Siberian Yupik languages (being definitely a mutually unintelligible, different language for them, not just a dialect of their own). This difference from all their language relatives may be the result of a supposed long isolation from other Eskimo groups: Sireniki Eskimos may have been in contact only with speakers of unrelated languages for many centuries in the past, influenced especially by non-relative Chukchi.

==== Internal ====

Although the number of its speakers was very few even at the end of the nineteenth century, the language had at least two dialects in the past.

=== Typological ===

As for its morphological typology, it has polysynthetic and incorporative features (just like the other Eskimo languages).

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===

* Some consonants can be palatalized, e.g.: .
* Sounds are heard as variants of .

=== Vowels ===
* Sounds may also range to .

== Morphology ==

Like all other Eskimo languages, the morphology is rather complex. A description grouped by lexical categories follows.

=== Nominal and verbal ===

Although morphology will be treated grouped into a nominal and a verbal part, many Eskimo languages show features which “crosscut” any such groupings in several aspects:
* the ergative structure at verbs is similar to the possessive structure at nouns (see section #Ergative–absolutive);
* a physical similarity exists between nominal and verbal personal suffix paradigms, i.e., in most cases, the respective person-number is expressed with the same sequence of phonemes at:
** possessive suffixes (at nouns)
** verbal suffixes;
* nomenverbum-like roots, becoming nominal or verbal only via the suffix they get;
* Eskimo texts abound in various kinds of participles (see section #Participles);

==== Common grammatical categories ====

Some grammatical categories (e.g. person and number) are applicable to both verbal and nominal lexical categories.

Although person and number are expressed in a single suffix, sometimes it can be traced back to consist of a distinct person and a distinct number suffix.

===== Person =====

Paradigms can make a distinction in 3rd person for “self”, thus the mere personal suffix (of the verb or noun) can distinguish e.g.
;a nominal example
:“He/she takes his/her own dog” versus “He/she takes the dog of another person”.
;a verbal example
:“He/she sees himself/herself” versus “He/she sees him/her (another person)”

Thus, it can be translated into English (and some other languages) using a reflexive pronoun. This notion concerns also other concepts in building larger parts of the sentence and the text, see section #Usage of third person suffixes.

===== Number =====

Although other Eskimo languages know more than the familiar two grammatical numbers, by having also dual, Sireniki uses only singular and plural. Sireniki is, as mentioned above, peculiar in this aspect, alongside Greenlandic, within the Eskimo–Aleut language family, with even its neighboring Siberian Yupik relatives having dual number.

==== Deictic demonstrative pronouns ====
Sireniki had an unusual wide range of deictic distinctions between up to four distances (near, medial, far and out_of_view) which could be horizontal “una”&gt;”igna”&gt;”ikna”, vertical “mana”&gt;”unygna”&gt;”pikna”, marking a movement like approaching the speaker “ukna”, away from them “agna”, refer to conversational topics be they definite “ugna”&gt;”k’amna”&gt;oov “amna” or indefinite “k’akymna”&gt;”k’agna”&gt;oov “akymna” or describe sth in the past “imna”.

==== Building verbs from nouns ====

Suffix -- meaning “to be similar to sth”:

===== Predicative form of a noun =====

Predicative form of a noun can be built using suffix --:

===== Verbs built from toponyms =====

* (a toponym: Imtuk)
* (I travel to Imtuk.)

=== Nominal lexical categories ===

==== Grammatical categories ====

Not only the grammatical cases of nouns are marked by suffixes, but also the person of possessor (use of possessive pronouns in English) can be expressed by agglutination.
It is just an excerpt for illustration: not all cases are shown, Sirenik language has more grammatical cases. The table illustrates also why Sirenik language is treated as agglutinative (rather than fusional).

There is no grammatical gender (or gender-like noun class system).

===== Case =====
Sireniki is an absolutive–ergative language.

Cases (listed using Menovščikov&#x27;s numbering):
# Absolutive
# Relative case, playing the role of both genitive case and ergative case.
# Ablative / Instrumental, used also in accusative structures.
# Dative / Lative
# Locative
# Vialis case, see also Prosecutive case, and &quot;motion via&quot;
# Equative (comparative)

To see why a single case can play such distinct roles at all, read morphosyntactic alignment, and also a short table about it.

Some finer grammatical functions are expressed using postpositions. Most of them are built as a combinations of cases
* lative or locative or ablative
* combined with relative (used as genitive)
in a similar way as we use expressions like &quot;on top of&quot; in English.

=== Verbal lexical categories ===
Also at verbs, the morphology is very rich. Suffixes can express grammatical moods of the verb (e.g. imperative, interrogative, optative), and also negation, tense, aspect, the person of subject and object. Some examples (far from being comprehensive):

The rich set of morphemes makes it possible to build huge verbs whose meaning could be expressed (in most of widely known languages) as whole sentences (consisting of more words) . Sireniki – like the other Eskimo languages – has polysynthetic and incorporative features, in many forms, among others polypersonal agreement.

==== Grammatical categories ====

The polysynthetic and incorporative features mentioned above manifest themselves in most of the ways Sirenik language can express grammatical categories.

===== Transitivity =====

For background, see transitivity. (Remember also section #Ergative–absolutive.)

See also Nicole Tersis and Shirley Carter-Thomas (2005).

===== Polarity =====

Even the grammatical polarity can be expressed by adding a suffix to the verb.

An example for negative polarity: the negation form of the verb (to go):
* (the man walks)
* (the man does not walk)

===== Aspect =====

Grammatical aspect:
* (to work slowly) and (he works slowly), from (to work)

===== Modality =====

Also linguistic modality can be expressed by suffixes. Modal verbs like &quot;want to&quot;, &quot;wish to&quot; etc. do not even exist:

The table illustrates also why Sirenik is treated as agglutinative (rather than fusional).

===== Voice =====

Four grammatical voices are mentioned in:
;active
;passive
:confer that variant of Siberian Yupik which is spoken by Ungazigmit
;middle (medial)
;causative
: (Malika makes Kitugi go to the reindeer.)
all of them are expressed by agglutination, thus, no separate words are required.

=== Participles ===

A distinction between two kinds of participles (adverbial participle and adjectival participle) makes sense in Sireniki (just like in Hungarian, see határozói igenév and melléknévi igenév for detailed description of these concepts; or in Russian, see деепричастие and причастие).

Sireniki has many kinds of participles in both categories. In the following, they will be listed, grouped by the relation between the “dependent action” and “main action” (or by other meanings beyond this, e.g. modality) – following the terminology of Menovschikov (1964). A sentence with a participle can be imagined as simulating a subordinating compound sentence where the action described in the dependent clause relates somehow to the action described in the main clause. In English, an adverbial clause may express reason, purpose, condition, succession etc., and a relative clause can express many meanings, too.

In an analogous way, in Sireniki Eskimo language, the &quot;dependent action&quot; (expressed by the adverbial participle in the sentence element called adverbial, or expressed by the adjectival participle in the sentence element called attribute) relates somehow to the “main action” (expressed by the verb in the sentence element called predicate), and the participles will be listed below grouped by this relation (or by other meanings beyond this, e.g. modality).

==== Adverbial participles ====

They can be translated into English e.g. by using an appropriate adverbial clause. There are many of them, with various meanings.

An interesting feature: they can have person and number. The person of the dependent action need not coincide with that of the main action. An example (meant in the British English usage of “shall / should” in the 1st person: here, conveying only conditional, but no necessity or morality):

Another example (with a different adverbial participle):

They will be discussed in more details below.

===== Reason, purpose or circumstance of action =====

An adverbial participle “explaining reason, purpose or circumstance of action” is expressed by suffix -- / -- (followed by appropriate person-number suffix). Examples:

Another example, with a somewhat different usage:

===== Dependent action ends just before main action begins =====

Using the adverbial participle -- / --, the dependent action (expressed by the adverbial participle in the sentence element called adverbial) finishes just before the main action (expressed by the verb in the sentence element called predicate) begins.

===== Dependent action begins before main action, but they continue together till end =====

It can be expressed by suffix --. Examples:
where


Another example:
===== Conditional =====

Dependent action is conditional: it does not takes place, although it would (either really, or provided that some—maybe irreal—conditions would hold). Confer also conditional sentence.

Sireniki Eskimo has several adverbial participles to express that. We can distinguish them according to the concerned condition (conveyed by the dependent action): it may be
* either real (possible to take place in the future)
* or irreal (it would take place only if some other irreal condition would hold)

====== Real ======

It is expressed with suffix -- / --, let us see e.g. a paradigm beginning with (if I get off / depart); (if you get off / depart):

====== Irreal ======
Confer counterfactual conditional. Sireniki can compress it into an adverbial participle: it is expressed with suffix -- / --.

The dependent action is expressed with an adverbial participle. The main action is conveyed by the verb. If also the main action is conditional (a typical usage), than it can be expressed with a verb of conditional mood. The persons need not coincide.

An example (meant in the British English usage of “shall / should” in the 1st person: here, conveying only conditional, but no necessity or morality):

The example in details:

Dependent action:

==== Adjectival participles ====

There are more kinds of them.
* (The sledge [that went to Imtuk] returned.)
* (I saw [perceived] a sleeping man.)
They can be used not only in attributive role (as in the above examples), but also in predicative role:
* (The man is sleeping.)

===== Modality =====

Adjectival participle - / - conveys a meaning related rather to modality (than to the relation of dependent action and main action). It conveys meaning “able to”.
* (A child who is able to walk moves around spontaneously)

== Syntax ==

=== Ergative–absolutive ===

Sireniki is (just like many Eskimo languages) an ergative–absolutive language. For English-language materials treating this feature of Sireniki, see Vakhtin&#x27;s book,

<text>Dominic Agostino (October 14, 1959 – March 24, 2004) was a Canadian politician who represented the riding of Hamilton East for the Liberal Party in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 until his death in 2004.

==Background==
Born in Sicily, Italy, Agostino was raised in Hamilton, Ontario and attended Mohawk College in that city. He worked as rehabilitation counsellor with the Ontario March of Dimes, and was a special assistant to Ontario Minister of Culture Lily Munro from 1985 to 1987.

==Politics==
Agostino was elected as a Catholic separate school board trustee in the Hamilton-Wentworth board at the age of 21, serving from 1980 to 1987. He campaigned in the 1985 provincial election in Hamilton Mountain, and finished third against New Democrat Brian Charlton. He then served as an alderman on the Hamilton City Council from 1987 until the provincial election of 1995.

He was elected as the Member of Provincial Parliament for Hamilton East. He was the first Liberal candidate to win the riding since 1937, and the first member of Hamilton&#x27;s Italian community to win a provincial election anywhere in the city. He defeated Andrew MacKenzie, the son of outgoing New Democratic Party Labour Minister Bob Mackenzie, by about 4,000 votes.

The 1995 election was won by the Progressive Conservative Party, and Agostino quickly emerged as a prominent figure in the parliamentary opposition. He became a leading spokesperson for the Liberal Party&#x27;s left wing, and gained particular praise for his performance as the party&#x27;s Environment Critic from 1996 to 1999.

In 1996, Agostino supported Gerard Kennedy&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the party leadership. He was re-elected without difficulty in the provincial election of 1999, and served as Chief Opposition Whip from 1999 to 2002. Unlike some others in his party, he supported the City of Hamilton&#x27;s amalgamation in 2000.

The Liberals won a majority government in the provincial election of 2003, although Agostino was re-elected with a somewhat reduced margin of victory. To the surprise of many in the province, he was not appointed to the first cabinet of Dalton McGuinty in October 2003. This was widely interpreted as a snub, but subsequent events cast the decision in a much different light: Agostino died on March 24, 2004, of liver cancer. He had been battling the disease for some time and had undergone surgery during the 2003 campaign, although this information was not made public until his death.

In a by-election to fill his legislative seat held on May 13, 2004, his brother Ralph, a Catholic separate school board trustee, failed to retain the Hamilton East seat for the Liberal Party, falling far behind city councillor and NDP candidate Andrea Horwath.

==Sexuality==
Shortly after his death, the Toronto-based LGBT community magazine &quot;fab&quot; published a piece titled &quot;Why Did He Die a Straight Man?&quot;, in which the author, Eleanor Brown, alleged that Agostino was in the closet about his sexuality; she highlighted Agostino&#x27;s support for legislation granting spousal benefits to same-sex partners, attendance at Gay Day at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland in 1997, and regular patronage of clubs in Toronto&#x27;s Church and Wellesley area. Neither Agostino nor his friends made any public statement on the matter. Agostino was quoted as saying: &quot;As long as you are consistent, your private life should remain private.&quot;

Initial media reports on his death stated erroneously that he was married, naming Agostino&#x27;s sister-in-law Rose as his wife. This was quickly retracted by the media, and attributed to a journalist&#x27;s misinterpretation of the government press release announcing Agostino&#x27;s death (&quot;Our thoughts and love are with Dominic&#x27;s mother Theresa, his brother Ralph and his wife Rose, Dominic&#x27;s sister Mary and her husband Tony, and Dominic&#x27;s beloved nieces and nephews.&quot;)

<text>Stefan Anton George (; 12 July 18684 December 1933) was a German symbolist poet and a translator of Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, Hesiod, and Charles Baudelaire. He is also known for his role as leader of the highly influential literary circle called the and for founding the literary magazine &quot;&quot; ().

==Biography==
===Early life===
George was born in 1868 in (now part of Bingen) in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. His father, also named Stefan George, was an innkeeper and wine merchant, and his mother Eva (née Schmitt) was a homemaker. When Stefan was five years old, the family moved to Bingen am Rhein.

According to Michael and Erika Metzger, both sides of the George family had lived in the area for generations and had risen from peasants, to millers, and finally to small town merchants.

At the time, the Roman Catholic Church was very important to the daily life of Bingen am Rhein and to the George family. Life revolved around the feast days of the Liturgical Calendar. Furthermore, when Stefan&#x27;s mother died, the oleander trees she had planted when she had married her husband were donated to the nuns of the nearby Rochusberg, which symbolized a returning of God&#x27;s gifts back to Him.

After attending primary school in Bingen, Stefan was sent, at the age of thirteen, to one of the best secondary schools in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, the Ludwig-Georgs-Gymnasium in the Grand-Duke Louis IV&#x27;s capital city of Darmstadt. There, from 1882 to 1888, Stefan, &quot;received a vigorous humanistic education in which Greek, Latin, and French were stressed.&quot;

Stefan &quot;excelled in French&quot; and gained &quot;a thorough knowledge of modern European literature, as well as of the Greek and Roman authors.&quot;

Although later described as a loner, Stefan assembled his first circle of friends in Darmstadt, where he had access to libraries and to the theater, which fascinated him. He also taught himself to read Norwegian in order to read the works of Henrik Ibsen in the original language.

===The making of a poet===
At the age of nineteen, George and a few other students of the Gymnasium started a literary journal called (). Here George published his first poems under the pseudonym Edmund Delorme. Even though the Gymnasium emphasized the poetry of the German Romantics, George taught himself Italian, in order to both read and translate the Renaissance poets whom he most revered. His first poems consisted of literary translations and imitations of the Italian poetry of Petrarch and Torquato Tasso.

When his schooling was concluded in 1888, it was clear to George and to his family that it would not work for him to follow the usual course into university, business, or the German civil service. Instead he began to travel.

He later told a friend, &quot;Germany was intolerable then; just think of Nietzsche! I would have thrown a bomb if they had kept me here; or I would have perished like Nietzsche. My father was glad to get rid of me, for he sensed the danger.&quot;

Hoping to improve his grasp of English, George lived in London between May and October 1888. Queen Victoria was on the throne and London was still the capital of the global British Empire. George later recalled that in England he saw, &quot;an expansive sense of life, borne by great political tasks and goals, an ancient cultural unity which carefully preserved traditions, a firmly moded way of life for all classes of the populace, a decorous politeness among all the people, phenomena which were no longer found in the Germany of those years, or which were just beginning to emerge.&quot;

It is also believed to have been during his time in London that George first encountered the English poetry the &quot;honored masters&quot; Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Algernon Charles Swinburne, and Ernest Dowson, whose works George would later translate into German and publish in his homeland.

While briefly returning to Germany and his parental home in Bingen, George expressed a desire to convene a &quot;Congress&quot; of like-minded poets and to publish a collection of their works.

This was an idea deeply rooted in both the Western Canon and in German literature, as Goethe, Schiller, and the other German Romantic poets had circles of adherents who gathered around them. Even before that, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock had referred to his closest friends as, () and had made detailed plans for ().

During his subsequent tours of Switzerland and northern Italy, George played the title role in a production of Moliere&#x27;s performed at Montreux. George later recalled, &quot;Can you imagine anything more contradictory than that I, the socialist, communard, atheist, should play in a comedy with a German baron in the house of a professor of theology surrounded by a whole bevy of society ladies?&quot;

Suffering from severe loneliness, George arrived in Paris in May 1889. On his first day there, he met the French poet Albert Saint-Paul, through whom George was introduced into the city&#x27;s literary bohemia. Despite the intensely anti-German revanchism reigning over French culture during the Belle Époque, George found himself &quot;spontaneously accepted by his peers.&quot; Through Albert Saint-Paul, George was introduced to Paul Verlaine, Francis Vielé-Griffin, Albert Mockel, and Waclaw Rolicz-Lieder.

Saint-Paul also persuaded the poet Stéphane Mallarmé to invite George to attend the Tuesday Symbolist soirées held in, &quot;that little room in the Rue de Rome&quot;. George had been described to Mallarmé as resembling &quot;the young Goethe before &quot;Werther&quot;&quot;. When they met, Mallarmé received George warmly, particularly when the latter revealed that he had recently begun translating Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s into German.

Many years later, the members of Mallarmé&#x27;s circle were to recall that they immediately identified Stefan George as, &quot;a poet of unusual promise.&quot; Despite his confidence, George seemed extremely shy and rarely participated in the circle&#x27;s discussions, preferring instead to listen and learn. Meanwhile, George also filled 365 pages with poems by French and other European authors, many of which he was later to translate into German.

According to the Metzgers, &quot;For the Symbolists, the pursuit of &#x27;art for art&#x27;s sake&#x27; was a highly serious – nearly a sacred – function, since beauty, in and of itself, stood for a higher meaning beyond itself. In their ultimate higher striving, the French Symbolists are not far from the Platonic ideals of the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, and this idealistic aspect was undoubtedly what appealed to George far more than the Estheticism, the Bohemianism, and the apparent Nihilism so often superficially associated with this group.&quot;

Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé were the only living poets whom George considered his superiors and whose apprentice he ever wished to be. Particularly Mallarmé, whose circle of disciples called him (), was to be a lifelong model for George&#x27;s art, philosophy, and way of life.

The French Symbolists were every bit as enthusiastic for George, as is revealed by the evidence of their surviving letters and subsequent memoirs of his visit to Paris, which were published in a 1928 theme issue of the . George wrote in 1896, &quot;Paris, the only place where I found and possess true friends.&quot;

At this time, George felt a very intense hostility to what he saw as the banality and philistinism of German culture during the German Empire. In his subsequent poem (), which celebrates his visit to Paris and &quot;whose title recalls the original unity of Germany and France under Charlemagne&quot;, George denounced the militarism and expansionism of the Imperial Government, &quot;the complacent materialism of the German middle class&quot;, and the hostility to German artists, poets, and intellectuals. George asked the German people, &quot;Where is your bard, you proud and boastful race?&quot; He then answered that there was no one, as the German people had driven Friedrich Nietzsche insane and forced Arnold Böcklin into exile. Even so, &quot;Stefan George&#x27;s experience in Paris during the early 1890&#x27;s ... impelled him to return to Germany to give a new voice and form to German poetry.&quot;
After returning to Germany, George first began to study Romance languages and their literature at Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, where he remained for three semesters.

At the time, George had serious doubts about the ability of the German language to say what he wished to say in his poems. For this reason, he preferred instead to write French and Spanish poetry and even invented a language which he dubbed Lingua Romana, which combined words from Spanish and Latin with German syntax.

George also seriously considered emigrating to Mexico at the urging of a wealthy Mexican family he had met and befriended in Paris. When George saw the family off on a ship back to Mexico, he gave them a copy of the first collection of his poems in German, (), which had just been privately printed in a limited edition of 100 copies.

Also while living in Berlin, George joined forces with fellow student Carl August Klein to found the annual literary magazine entitled &quot;&quot;. At the time, George felt that German poets had been reduced to two main literary movements, both of which he opposed. The first was for a poet to be &quot;a provider of a pleasant diversion&quot;, or as Arno Holz called such poetry, &quot;a lilac-sweet spring rhapsode&quot;. The other role was for a poet to become a Naturalistic social critic, or what George sarcastically termed, &quot;an apostle of reality&quot;. Stefan George and Carl Klein therefore intended for to be a vehicle for what they termed &quot;the new art&quot;, which was intended to both build upon and supersede both literary movements within German poetry, while also drawing upon the ideas of the French Symbolists.

While George was not the first German poet to draw inspiration from the French Symbolists, he has been termed, &quot;the most gifted, eloquent, and productive exponent of the poetic aspects of the movement in his homeland&quot;. George also, &quot;did not slavishly follow any masters&quot;, but set his own stamp upon those aspects of Symbolism that he found appropriate for his purpose of revitalizing German culture and German literature.

George was the main person of the literary and academic group known as the (), which included some of the major, young writers of the time such as Friedrich Gundolf and Ludwig Klages. In addition to sharing cultural interests, the group promoted mystical and political themes. George knew and befriended the &quot;Bohemian Countess&quot; of Schwabing, Fanny zu Reventlow, who sometimes satirised the group for its melodramatic actions and opinions. George and his writings were identified with the Conservative Revolutionary philosophy. He was homosexual, yet exhorted his young friends to have a celibate life like his own.

===Ida Coblenz===
Stefan George met Ida Coblenz, a wealthy and cultured German Jewish heiress who both admired his poems and showed very deep insights into them, at Bingen am Rhein in 1892. Many of George&#x27;s poems in (1895), (1897), and even in (1907) were inspired by her. Many years later, Stefan George told his friends that there had been a woman who was &quot;my world&quot;.

George saw Ida often, particularly in the fall of 1894 and the summer of 1896. Ida&#x27;s brief and unhappy arranged marriage to Leopold Auerbach, a Jewish businessman from Berlin, did nothing to interrupt her relationship with George. When Ida, however, began a relationship with the married poet Richard Dehmel, whom she later married in 1901, George viewed Ida&#x27;s decision as a betrayal of the worst order. Dehmel, due to his Marxism, Bohemianism, and &quot;sensual glorification of life as it is&quot;, stood for everything that George detested in German poetry in Imperial Germany.

After meeting Dehmel before Coblenz&#x27;s house in Bingen, George wrote to her, &quot;Our [friendship] arises from the fact that each of us is able to communicate what he thinks great and noble to the other – it rises and falls with this ability – and disappears entirely when something appears great and noble to one which is brutal and debased to the other.&quot;

George had been planning to dedicate his 1897 poetry collection to Ida Coblenz. Instead, the name of George&#x27;s sister was printed where that of Ida Coblenz was intended to have stood.

===World War I and rise of the Nazi Party===
During 1914, at the start of the World War, George foretold a sad end for Germany. In 1916, in a deliberate revolt against the jingoistic literary movement known as , which was overwhelmingly popular on the German home-front during the First World War, George wrote and published the pessimistic poem ().

The outcome of the war was the realization of his worst fears. In the 1920s, George despised the culture of Germany, particularly its bourgeois mentality and archaic church rites. He wished to create a new, noble German culture, and offered &quot;form&quot;, regarded as a mental discipline and a guide to relationships with others, as an ideal while Germany was in a period of social, political, spiritual and artistic decadence.

George&#x27;s poetry was discovered by the small but ascendant Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), a precursor to Nazism, which had its roots in Bavaria. George&#x27;s concepts of &quot;the thousand year Reich&quot; and &quot;fire of the blood&quot; were adopted by the NSDAP and incorporated into the party&#x27;s propaganda. George would come to detest their racial theories, especially the notion of the &quot;Nordic superman&quot;.

According to Peter Hoffmann, Stefan George &quot;had a low opinion of Hitler, in whom he saw none of the greatness of a Caesar or a Napoleon&quot;. Shortly before Hitler became Chancellor on 30 January 1933, &quot;the poet said that if the National Socialists came to power, everyone in Germany would have to wear a noose around his neck, and those who refused would be hanged immediately.&quot;

In February 1933, the Nazis began dismissing all of their political opponents as well as Jews from the Prussian Academy of the Arts; this included Thomas Mann, René Schickele, Georg Kaiser, and Franz Werfel. They were replaced with politically reliable &quot;national writers&quot;, such as Hans Grimm and Hans Carossa.

By April 1933, George was referring to the National Socialists as &quot;hangmen.&quot; He also assigned the youngest of his followers, Karl Josef Partsch, to talk Frank Mehnert out of joining any Nazi-affiliated organizations.

On 5 May 1933 the Prussian Minister for Sciences, Arts, and Public Education, Bernhard Rust, informed George that the new government wished to appoint him to an honorary position within the academy. Rust further explained that he intended to publicly describe George as the forefather of the Nazi Party&#x27;s &quot;national revolution&quot;, and also offered him a large sum of money to do with as he wished. If George was agreeable to the proposal, President Paul von Hindenburg or Chancellor Adolf Hitler would personally write the official letter.

On 10 May 1933 George replied by letter. He declined both the money and the honorary position &quot;in the so-called academy&quot;, but said that he approved of its &quot;national&quot; orientation. George explained, however, that he had administered German literature for five decades without any need for an academy. On the other hand, George did not deny his &quot;ancestorship of the new national movement and did not preclude his intellectual cooperation&quot;.

There were those within the Nazi Party, however, who were enraged by George&#x27;s negative response to the offer, who suspected the sincerity of his claims of sympathy for the national revolution, and who even denounced Stefan George by calling him a Jew.

In order to renew his passport, George returned to his native Bingen am Rhein at the beginning of July 1933, but left for Berlin-Dahlem just four days before his 65th birthday. Some historians believe that this was a deliberate effort to evade official honors from the new government. However, the new Government made no further efforts beyond a personal telegram of congratulations from Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels.

===Death in exile===
On 25 July 1933 George travelled to Wasserburg on Lake Constance, where he remained for four weeks. He was joined there at various times by Frank Mehnert, Berthold von Stauffenberg, Claus von Stauffenberg, and other younger members of the .

On 24 August 1933 George took a ferry across the lake to Heiden, Switzerland. Although George had chosen to make the journey to escape the humid lakeside air and had spent the previous two winters at Minusio, George later said, in an example of his &quot;mild political humor&quot;, that in the middle of the lake he began to breathe far more easily.

Berthold von Stauffenberg arrived at Minusio on 27 September 1933, shortly after the attending the wedding at Bamberg of his brother Claus to Baroness Nina von Lerchenfeld, and found George feeling very weak and devoid of appetite.

That same month, however, George declared that both his way of life and his friendships were sufficient proof of his tolerance and indifference to all religions.

In November 1933, Frank Mehnert spread the news that George&#x27;s medical condition was very grave. Mehnert, Robert Boehringer, Walter Kempner, and Clotilde Schlayer took turns keeping vigil at his hospital bedside. When Karl Josef Partsch, Albrecht von Blumenthal, Walter Anton, Ludwig Thormaehlen, and the three Stauffenberg brothers also arrived, they were allowed a brief glimpse of George in his darkened room; but the poet was not aware of their presence.

Stefan George died at Minusio on 4 December 1933. Although Berthold von Stauffenberg, Thormaehlen, Anton, Blumenthal, and others wished to return his body to Germany for burial, Boehringer, as the poet&#x27;s heir, overruled them by quoting George&#x27;s own words: &quot;A man should be buried where he dies.&quot; In response, the decided to inter him locally. Claus von Stauffenberg organized the wake in accordance with the customs of the Italian-speaking Canton of Ticino and the kept constant vigil at the Minusio cemetery chapel until the morning of 6 December 1933.

On 5 December the German Consulate at Lugano contacted the city officials of Minusio and asked for the date and time of the funeral. The replied that the funeral would be at 3pm on 6 December but added that mourners from outside the Circle were not wanted. Just in case, the funeral was then secretly rescheduled for 8:15 on the morning of 6 December. Boehringer, however, disapproved of the deception and quietly informed Baron Ernst von Weizsäcker, the German Minister at Bern, that he could deliver a wreath to the grave on the day after the funeral.

Twenty-five members of the , including Jewish members Ernst Morwitz and Karl Wolfskehl, attended the funeral. The laurel wreath later delivered by the German Foreign Office bore a swastika printed on a white ribbon. This subsequently caused a running battle within the Circle between those, like Clotilde Schlayer, who repeatedly chose to remove it and other members who kept replacing it with new swastika ribbons. As the mourners left the railroad station at Locarno following the ceremony, some of the younger members of the were seen to give the Nazi salute.

According to the Metzgers, &quot;When Stefan George died in 1933, there was a grim dissonance between the eulogies from inside and outside Germany, the former claiming George as the prophet of the Third Reich, which had taken power that year, the latter often interpreting his silence as expressing his utter contempt for the new regime.&quot;

==Literary achievements==
From the inception of the Circle, George and his followers represented a literary and cultural revolt against the literary realism trend in German literature during the last decades of the German Empire.

George was also a highly important intermediary between German Romanticism and literary realism of the 19th century and the 20th-century Expressionist and Modernist poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke, August Stramm, Reinhard Sorge, and Berthold Brecht. Even though George was, like his fellow war poets Siegfried Sassoon, Hedd Wyn, and Wilfred Owen, a very harsh critic of his own era, he was also very much a man of his own time.

George&#x27;s poetry is characterized by an aristocratic ethos; his verse is formal in style, lyrical in tone, and often arcane in language, being influenced by Greek classical forms. By both emulating and building upon the literary language of the German Romantics and Biedermeier poets, &quot;Stefan George&#x27;s poetry&quot;, according to Peter Hoffmann, &quot;helped to form modern literary German.&quot; He also experimented with various poetic metres, punctuation, obscure allusions and typography.

Believing that the purpose of poetry was to create an alternative to reality he was a strong advocate of art for art&#x27;s sake George&#x27;s beliefs about poetry were drawn from the French Symbolist poets and he considered himself to be both the student and the successor of Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine.

Stefan George&#x27;s &quot;evident homosexuality&quot; is represented by works such as &quot;Algabal&quot; and the love poetry he devoted to a gifted adolescent of his acquaintance named Maximilian Kronberger, whom he called &quot;Maximin&quot;, and whom he believed to be a manifestation of the divine. The relevance of George&#x27;s sexuality to his poetic work has been discussed by contemporary critics, such as Thomas Karlauf and Marita Keilson-Lauritz.

&quot;Algabal&quot; is one of George&#x27;s best remembered collections of poetry, if also one of his strangest; the title is a reference to the effete Roman emperor Elagabalus. George was also an important translator; he translated Dante, Shakespeare and Baudelaire into German.

George was awarded the inaugural Goethe Prize in 1927.
George&#x27;s last complete book of poems, (), was published in 1928. It was banned in Occupied Germany after World War II, as the title sounded tainted by Nazism. But George had dedicated the work, which includes the lyric &quot;&quot; () written in 1922, to Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, who, with his brother Claus, took a leading role in the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and overthrow the Nazi Party. Both brothers, who were executed after the plot failed, had considered themselves to be acting on the teachings of George by trying to kill Hitler and put an end to Nazism. The book describes a new form of society ruled by a hierarchical spiritual aristocracy. George rejected all attempts to use it for mundane political purposes, including those of Nazism.

==Influence==
In a view inspired by the German Romantic poets and the French Symbolist, George and his followers saw him as the monarch of a separate government of Germany, composed of his intellectual and artistic disciples, bonded by their faithfulness to &quot;The Master&quot; and to a common vision. In his memoirs, Albert Speer claims to have met George during the early 1920s and that his elder brother, Hermann, was an acquaintance of his: George &quot;radiated dignity and pride and a kind of priestliness ... there was something magnetic about him.&quot;

George&#x27;s poetry emphasized self-sacrifice, heroism, and power, which won him the approval of the National Socialists. Though many Nazis claimed George as an influence, George remained aloof from such associations. Soon after the Nazi seizure of power, George left Germany for Switzerland where he died the same year.

Some of the members of the 20 July plot against Hitler were drawn from among his devotees, notably the Stauffenberg brothers who were introduced to George by the poet and classical scholar Albrecht von Blumenthal. Although some members of the George circle were avowedly anti-semitic (for example, Klages), the Circle also included Jewish authors such as Gundolf, the historian Ernst Kantorowicz, the Zionist Karl Wolfskehl, and Erich Berger. George was fond of his Jewish disciples, but he expressed reservations about their ever becoming a majority in the group.

George&#x27;s influence on Ernst Kantorowicz was decisive in the latter&#x27;s controversial biography of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, which was published in 1927. The book&#x27;s account of Frederick II and his &quot;dynamic personality and ability to shape the Empire according to a higher vision seemed to sum up the aspirations of the George Circle.&quot; George is even reported to have &quot;carefully corrected&quot; the manuscript and saw that it was published.

One of George&#x27;s most well known collaborators was Hugo von Hofmannsthal, a leading literary modernist in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Hofmannsthal, however, refused membership in the group. Later in life, Hofmannsthal wrote that no one had influenced him more than George. Those closest to the &quot;Master,&quot; as George had his disciples call him, included several members of the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler, among them Claus von Stauffenberg himself. Stauffenberg frequently quoted George&#x27;s poem &quot; () to his fellow members of the 20 July plot.

===Stefan George in music and film===
Stefan George&#x27;s poetry was a major influence upon the 20th-century classical music composed by the Second Viennese School, particularly during their Expressionist period.

Radically innovative Austrian Jewish composer Arnold Schoenberg set George&#x27;s poetry to music in the &quot;, Op. 14/1 (1907), String Quartet No. 2, Op. 10 (1908), and in &quot;The Book of the Hanging Gardens&quot;, Op. 15 (1909). Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s student Anton Webern also set George&#x27;s poetry to music in his early choral work , Op. 2. Webern did the same in two other sets of songs, Op. 3 and 4 of 1909, and in several posthumously published vocal compositions from the same period.

Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s 1976 comedy film &quot;Satan&#x27;s Brew&quot; pokes fun at both Stefan George and the .

<text>The Defoid languages are a proposed branch of the Benue–Congo language family. The name of the group derives from the fact that nearly all of the ethnic groups who speak member languages refer to the city of Ilé Ifè as their place of origin: &quot;Defoid&quot; comes from &quot;èdè&quot; (&#x27;language&#x27;) + &quot;ifè&quot; (Ife) + &quot;-oid&quot;. It was first proposed by Capo (1989), but evidence for it is still regarded as insufficient by Güldemann (2018).

The Defoid language group consists of three branches, Yoruboid, Akoko and Ayere-Ahan.

<doc id="549891" wikidata="Q5266729" url="?curid=549891" title="Development as Freedom">
<text>Development as Freedom is a 1999 book about international development by Indian economist and philosopher Amartya Sen.

The American edition of the book was published by Alfred A. Knopf.

==Summary==
Amartya Sen was the winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Economics. Development as Freedom was published one year later and argues that &quot;development&quot; entails a set of linked &quot;freedoms&quot;: 
*political freedoms and transparency in relations between people
*freedom of opportunity, including freedom to access credit; and
*economic protection from abject poverty, including through income supplements and unemployment relief.

Poverty is characterized by lack of at least one freedom (Sen uses the term &quot;unfreedom&quot; for lack of freedom), including a &quot;de facto&quot; lack of political rights and choice, vulnerability to coercive relations, and exclusion from economic choices and protections. 

Based on these ethical considerations, Sen argues that development cannot be reduced to simply increasing basic incomes, nor to rising average per capita incomes. Rather, it requires a package of overlapping mechanisms that progressively enable the exercise of a growing range of freedoms. A central idea of the book is that freedom is both the end and a means to development.

Sen notes, for example, that African Americans do not live to as old of ages as do people in regions of the world with comparatively smaller incomes. These regions include China, Costa Rica, and Kerala (an Indian state). While the African Americans would be seen as having lower poverty rates by traditional measurements of poverty (e.g., amount of income), a more multi-dimensional view of poverty - that includes poverty of reaching an old age - makes this less clear. This underscores Sen&#x27;s idea that poverty and development should be seen as terms referring to someone&#x27;s freedom. While higher incomes certainly allow someone to have more freedom to do what they want in life and to be living without serious material deprivation, Sen would argue that serious freedoms also include things like freedom to reach an old age. In achieving these freedoms, Sen says, measures should include things like employment opportunities, education, and access to health care.

A key observation in this book is that, &quot;no famine has ever taken place in a functioning democracy.&quot;

Canadian social scientist Lars Osberg wrote about the book: &quot;Although &quot;Development as Freedom&quot; covers immense territory, it is subtle and nuanced and its careful scholarship is manifest at every turn.&quot; Kenneth Arrow concluded &quot;In this book, Amartya Sen develops elegantly, compactly, and yet broadly the concept that economic development is in its nature an increase in freedom.&quot;

<doc id="549892" wikidata="Q1337282" url="?curid=549892" title="GRASS GIS">
<text>Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (commonly termed GRASS GIS) is a geographic information system (GIS) software suite used for geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, producing graphics and maps, spatial and temporal modeling, and visualizing. It can handle raster, topological vector, image processing, and graphic data.

GRASS GIS contains over 350 modules to render maps and images on monitor and paper; manipulate raster and vector data including vector networks; process multispectral image data; and create, manage, and store spatial data.

It is licensed and released as free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It runs on multiple operating systems, including , Windows and Linux. Users can interface with the software features through a graphical user interface (GUI) or by &quot;plugging into&quot; GRASS via other software such as QGIS. They can also interface with the modules directly through a bespoke shell that the application launches or by calling individual modules directly from a standard shell. The latest stable release version (LTS) is GRASS GIS 7, which is available since 2015.

The GRASS development team is a multinational group consisting of developers at many locations. GRASS is one of the eight initial software projects of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation.

==Architecture==
GRASS supports raster and vector data in two and three dimensions. The vector data model is topological, meaning that areas are defined by boundaries and centroids; boundaries cannot overlap within one layer. In contrast, OpenGIS Simple Features, defines vectors more freely, much as a non-georeferenced vector illustration program does.

GRASS is designed as an environment in which tools that perform specific GIS computations are executed. Unlike GUI-based application software, the GRASS user is presented with a Unix shell containing a modified environment that supports execution of GRASS commands, termed modules. The environment has a state that includes parameters such as the geographic region covered and the map projection in use. All GRASS modules read this state and additionally are given specific parameters (such as input and output maps, or values to use in a computation) when executed. Most GRASS modules and abilities can be operated via a graphical user interface (provided by a GRASS module), as an alternative to manipulating geographic data in a shell.

The GRASS distribution includes over 350 core modules. Over 100 add-on modules created by users are offered on its website. The libraries and core modules are written in C. Other modules are written in C, C++, Python, Unix shell, Tcl, or other scripting languages. The modules are designed under the Unix philosophy and hence can be combined using Python or shell scripting to build more complex or specialized modules, by users, without knowledge of C programming.

There is cooperation between the GRASS and Quantum GIS (QGIS) projects. Recent versions of QGIS can be executed within the GRASS environment, allowing QGIS to be used as a user-friendly graphical interface to GRASS that more closely resembles other graphical GIS software than does the shell-based GRASS interface.

Another project exists to re-implement GRASS in Java as &quot;JGRASS&quot;.

==History==
GRASS has been under continuous development since 1982 and has involved a large number of federal US agencies, universities, and private companies. The core components of GRASS and the management of integration of efforts into its releases was originally directed by the U.S. Army - Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA-CERL), a branch of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in Champaign, Illinois. USA-CERL completed its last release of GRASS as version 4.1 in 1992, and provided five updates and patches to this release through 1995. USA-CERL also wrote the core components of the GRASS 5.0 floating point version.

The development of GRASS was started by the USA-CERL to meet the need of the United States military for software for land management and environmental planning. A key motive was the National Environmental Policy Act. The development platform was Unix running on VAX hardware. During 1982 through 1995, USA-CERL led the development of GRASS, with the involvement of many others, including universities and other federal agencies. USA-CERL officially ceased its involvement in GRASS after release 4.1 (1995), though development had been limited to minor patches since 1993. A group formed at Baylor University to take over the software, releasing GRASS 4.2. Around this time, a port of the software to Linux was made. In 1998, Markus Neteler, the current project leader, announced the release of GRASS 4.2.1, which offered major improvements including a new graphical user interface. In October 1999, the license of the originally public domain software GRASS software was changed to the GNU GPL in version 5.0.

Since then, GRASS has evolved into a powerful software suite with a wide range of applications in many different areas of scientific research and engineering. For example, it is used to estimate potential solar photovoltaic yield with r.sun. As of 2015, GRASS is used in academic and commercial settings around the world, and in many government agencies including NASA, NOAA, USDA, DLR, CSIRO, the National Park Service, the U.S. Census Bureau, USGS, and many environmental consulting companies.

, the latest stable release version (LTS) is GRASS GIS 7. It was released in 2015, replacing the old stable branch (6.4) which was released in 2011. Version 7 added many new features, including large data support, a fast topological 2D/3D vector engine, powerful vector network analysis, a full temporal framework and many other features and improvements.

, GRASS development is split into two branches: stable and developmental. The stable branch is recommended for most users, while the development branch operates as a testbed for new features.

<text>Wilms&#x27; tumor or Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children (rarely in adults), and occurs most commonly as a renal tumor in child patients. It is named after Max Wilms, the German surgeon (1867–1918) who first described it.

Approximately 650 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. annually. The majority of cases occur in children with no associated genetic syndromes; however, a minority of children with Wilms&#x27; tumor have a congenital abnormality.  It is highly responsive to treatment, with about 90 percent of children being cured.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Typical signs and symptoms of Wilms&#x27; tumor include the following:
* a painless, palpable abdominal mass
* loss of appetite
* abdominal pain
* fever
* nausea and vomiting
* blood in the urine (in about 20% of cases)
* high blood pressure in some cases (especially if synchronous or metachronous bilateral kidney involvement)
* Rarely as varicocele

== Pathogenesis ==
Wilms&#x27; tumor has many causes, which can broadly be categorized as syndromic and non-syndromic. Syndromic causes of Wilms&#x27; tumor occur as a result of alterations to genes such as the Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) or Wilms Tumor 2 (WT2) genes, and the tumor presents with a group of other signs and symptoms. Non-syndromic Wilms&#x27; tumor is not associated with other symptoms or pathologies. Many, but not all, cases of Wilms&#x27; tumor develop from nephrogenic rests, which are fragments of tissue in or around the kidney that develop before birth and become cancerous after birth. In particular, cases of bilateral Wilms&#x27; tumor, as well as cases of Wilms&#x27; tumor derived from certain genetic syndromes such as Denys-Drash syndrome, are strongly associated with nephrogenic rests. Most nephroblastomas are on one side of the body only and are found on both sides in less than 5% of cases, although people with Denys-Drash syndrome mostly have bilateral or multiple tumors. They tend to be encapsulated and vascularized tumors that do not cross the midline of the abdomen. In cases of metastasis it is usually to the lung. A rupture of Wilms&#x27; tumor puts the patient at risk of bleeding and peritoneal dissemination of the tumor. In such cases, surgical intervention by a surgeon who is experienced in the removal of such a fragile tumor is imperative.

Pathologically, a triphasic nephroblastoma comprises three elements:
* blastema
* mesenchyme (stroma)
* epithelium

Wilms&#x27; tumor is a malignant tumor containing metanephric blastema, stromal and epithelial derivatives. Characteristic is the presence of abortive tubules and glomeruli surrounded by a spindled cell stroma. The stroma may include striated muscle, cartilage, bone, fat tissue, and fibrous tissue. Dysfunction is caused when the tumor compresses the normal kidney parenchyma.

The mesenchymal component may include cells showing rhabdomyoid differentiation or malignancy (rhabdomyosarcomatous Wilms).

Wilms&#x27; tumors may be separated into two prognostic groups based on pathologic characteristics:
* &quot;Favorable&quot; – Contains well developed components mentioned above
* &quot;Anaplastic&quot; – Contains diffuse anaplasia (poorly developed cells)

===Molecular biology and related conditions===
Mutations of the &quot;WT1&quot; gene which is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p13) are observed in approximately 20% of Wilms&#x27; tumors, the majority of them being inherited from the germline, while a minority are acquired somatic mutations. In addition at least half of the Wilms&#x27; tumors with mutations in WT1 also carry acquired somatic mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding the proto-oncogene beta-catenin. This latter gene is found on short arm of chromosome 3 (3p22.1).

Most cases do not have mutations in any of these genes.

An association with H19 has been reported. H19 is a long noncoding RNA located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5).

== Diagnosis ==

The majority of people with Wilms&#x27; tumor present with an asymptomatic abdominal mass which is noticed by a family member or healthcare professional. Renal tumors can also be found during routine screening in children who have known predisposing clinical syndromes. The diagnostic process includes taking a medical history, a physical exam, and a series of tests including blood, urine, and imaging tests.

Once Wilms&#x27; tumor is suspected, an ultrasound scan is usually done first to confirm the presence of an intrarenal mass. A computed tomography scan or MRI scan can also be used for more detailed imaging. Finally, the diagnosis of Wilms&#x27; tumor is confirmed by a tissue sample. In most cases, a biopsy is not done first because there is a risk of cancer cells spreading during the procedure. Treatment in North America is nephrectomy or in Europe chemotherapy followed by nephrectomy. A definitive diagnosis is obtained by pathological examination of the nephrectomy specimen.

=== Staging ===

Staging is a standard way to describe the extent of spread of Wilms&#x27; tumors and to determine prognosis and treatments. Staging is based on anatomical findings and tumor cells pathology. According to the extent of tumor tissue at the time of initial diagnosis, four stages are considered, with a fifth classification for bilateral involvement.

==== Stage I ====
In Stage I Wilms&#x27; tumor (43% of cases), all of the following criteria must be met: 
* Tumor is limited to the kidney and is completely excised .
* The surface of the renal capsule is intact.
* The tumor is not ruptured or biopsied (open or needle) prior to removal.
* No involvement of extrarenal or renal sinus lymph-vascular spaces
* No residual tumor apparent beyond the margins of excision.
* Metastasis of tumor to lymph nodes not identified.

==== Stage II ====
In Stage II (23% of cases), 1 or more of the following criteria must be met: 
* Tumor extends beyond the kidney but is completely excised.
* No residual tumor apparent at or beyond the margins of excision.
* Any of the following conditions may also exist:
** Tumor involvement of the blood vessels of the renal sinus and/or outside the renal parenchyma.
** Extensive tumor involvement of renal sinus soft tissue.

==== Stage III ====
In Stage III (20% of cases), 1 or more of the following criteria must be met: 
* Inoperable primary tumor.
* Lymph node metastasis.
* Tumor is present at surgical margins.
* Tumor spillage involving peritoneal surfaces either before or during surgery, or transected tumor thrombus.
** The tumor has been biopsied prior to removal or there is local spillage of tumor during surgery, confined to the flank.

==== Stage IV ====
Stage IV (10% of cases) Wilms&#x27; tumor is defined by the presence of hematogenous metastases (lung, liver, bone, or brain), or lymph node metastases outside the abdominopelvic region.

==== Bilateral ====
5% of Wilms&#x27; tumor cases at the time of initial diagnosis are bilateral involvements, which pose unique challenges to treatment. An attempt should be made to stage each side according to the above criteria (stage I to III) on the basis of extent of disease prior to biopsy. Bilateral Wilms&#x27; tumors are as a whole placed in Stage V.

==Treatment and prognosis==
The overall 5-year survival is estimated to be approximately 90%, but for individuals the prognosis is highly dependent on individual staging and treatment. Early removal tends to promote positive outcomes.

Tumor-specific loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosomes 1p and 16q identifies a subset of Wilms&#x27; tumor patients who have a significantly increased risk of relapse and death. LOH for these chromosomal regions can now be used as an independent prognostic factor together with disease stage to target intensity of treatment to risk of treatment failure. Genome-wide copy number and LOH status can be assessed with virtual karyotyping of tumor cells (fresh or paraffin-embedded).

Statistics may sometimes show more favorable outcomes for more aggressive stages than for less aggressive stages, which may be caused by more aggressive treatment and/or random variability in the study groups. Also, a stage V tumor is not necessarily worse than, but nevertheless comparable in prognosis to a stage IV tumor.
In case of relapse of Wilms&#x27; tumor, the 4-year survival rate for children with a standard-risk has been estimated to be 80%.

==Epidemiology==
Wilms tumor is the most common malignant renal tumor in children. There are a number of rare genetic syndromes that have been linked to an increased risk of developing Wilms Tumor. Screening guidelines vary between countries; however health care professionals are recommending regular ultrasound screening for people with associated genetic syndromes.

Wilms&#x27; tumor affects approximately one person per 10,000 worldwide before the age of 15 years. People of African descent may have slightly higher rates of Wilms&#x27; tumor. The peak age of Wilms&#x27; tumor is 3 to 4 years and most cases occur before the age of 10 years. A genetic predisposition to Wilms&#x27; tumor in individuals with aniridia has been established, due to deletions in the p13 band on chromosome 11.

== History ==
Sidney Farber, founder of Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, and his colleagues achieved the first remissions in Wilms&#x27; tumor in the 1950s. By employing the antibiotic actinomycin D in addition to surgery and radiation therapy, they boosted cure rates from 40 to 89 percent.

The use of computed tomography scan for the diagnosis of Wilms&#x27; tumor began in the early 1970s, thanks to the intuition of Mario Costici, an Italian physician. He discovered that in the direct radiograms and in the urographic images, determining elements for a differential diagnosis with the Wilms&#x27; tumor can be identified. This possibility was a premise for starting a treatment.

<doc id="549895" wikidata="Q1898141" url="?curid=549895" title="Rhabdomyosarcoma">
<text>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly aggressive form of cancer that develops from mesenchymal cells that have failed to fully differentiate into myocytes of skeletal muscle. Cells of the tumor are identified as rhabdomyoblasts.

The four subtypes are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and spindle-cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma. Embryonal and alveolar are the main groups, and these types are the most common soft tissue sarcomas of childhood and adolescence. The pleomorphic type is usually found in adults.

It is generally considered to be a disease of childhood, as the vast majority of cases occur in those below the age of 18. It is commonly described as one of the small-blue-round-cell tumors of childhood due to its appearance on an H&amp;E stain. Despite being relatively rare, it accounts for approximately 40% of all recorded soft-tissue sarcomas.

RMS can occur in any soft-tissue site in the body, but is primarily found in the head, neck, orbit, genitourinary tract, genitals, and extremities. No clear risk factors have been identified, but the disease has been associated with some congenital abnormalities. Signs and symptoms vary according to tumor site, and prognosis is closely tied to the location of the primary tumor. Common sites of metastasis include the lungs, bone marrow, and bones. There are many classification systems for RMS and a variety of defined histological types. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type and comprises about 60% of cases.

Outcomes vary considerably, with five-year survival rates between 35 and 95%, depending on the type of RMS involved, so clear diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and management. 

Treatment usually involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. 60 to 70% of newly diagnosed patients with nonmetastatic disease can be cured using this combined approach to therapy. Despite aggressive multimodality treatment, less than 20% of patients with metastatic RMS are able to be cured of their disease.

==Types==
 Given the difficulty in diagnosing rhabdomyosarcoma, definitive classification of subtypes has proven difficult. As a result, classification systems vary by institute and organization. Rhabdomyosarcoma in the 2020 WHO classification, though, is listed as four histological subtypes: embryonal, alveolar, pleomorphic, and spindle-cell/sclerosing.

===Embryonal===
Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) is the most common histological variant, comprising about 60–70% of childhood cases. It is most common in children birth to four years old, with a maximum reported incidence of four cases per million children. ERMS is characterized by spindle-shaped cells with a stromal-rich appearance, and the morphology is similar to the developing muscle cells of a 6- to 8-week-old embryo. Tumors often present in the head and neck, as well as the genitourinary tract.

====Embryonal subtype====
Botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma is almost always found in mucosal-lined organs, including the vagina, bladder, and nasopharynx (although presentation in the nasopharynx typically affects older children). It often presents in infants younger than a year old, as a round, grape-like mass on the affected organ. Histologically, cells of the botryoid variant are defined by a dense tumor layer under an epithelium (cambium layer). This subtype has a good prognosis.

Botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma is also sometimes present in adult women, found in the cervix or uterus.

===Alveolar===
Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is the second-most common type. ARMS comprises around 20–25% of RMS-related tumors, and it is equally distributed among all age groups with an incidence of about one case per million people ages 0 to 19. For this reason, it is the most common form of RMS observed in young adults and teenagers, who are less prone to the embryonal variant. This type of RMS is characterized by densely packed, round cells that arrange around spaces similar in shape to pulmonary alveoli, although variants have been discovered without these characteristic alveolar spacings. ARMS tends to form more often in the extremities, trunk, and peritoneum. It is also typically more aggressive than ERMS.

===Pleomorphic===
Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma (undifferentiated rhabdomyosarcoma), also known as anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma, is defined by the presence of pleomorphic cells with large, lobate hyperchromatic nuclei and multipolar mitotic figures. These tumors display high heterogeneity and extremely poor differentiation. The pleomorphic cells may be diffuse or localized, with the diffuse variation correlating to a worse prognosis. It occurs most often in adults, rarely in children, and is often discovered in the extremities. Due to the lack of discernible separation among cancers of this type, clinicians often label undiagnosed sarcomas with little to no discernible features as anaplastic RMS. It is the most aggressive type of RMS, and often requires intensive treatment.

===Spindle-cell/sclerosing===
Spindle-cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma is an added subtype listed in the 2020 WHO classification of soft-tissue sarcomas.

This subtype is very similar to that of leiomyosarcoma (cancer of the smooth muscle tissue), and it has a fascicular, spindled, and leiomyomatous growth pattern with notable rhabdomyoblastic differentiation . It occurs most commonly in the paratesticular region, and the prognosis for this particular form of RMS is excellent with a reported five-year survival rate of 95%. The sclerosing aspect of this subtype has a hyaline sclerosis and pseudovascular development.

Multiple classification systems have been proposed for guiding management and treatment, and the most recent and widely used classification system is the &quot;International Classification of Rhabdomyosarcoma&quot; or ICR. It was created by the IRSG in 1995 after their series of four multi-institutional trials aimed at studying the presentation, histology, epidemiology, and treatment of RMS (IRSG I–IV). The ICR system is based on prognostic indicators identified in IRSG I–IV. Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma usually occurs in adults rather than children, and is therefore not included in this system.

==Signs and symptoms==
RMS can occur in almost any soft-tissue site in the body; the most common primary sites are genitourinary (24%), parameningeal (16%), extremity (19%), orbit (9%), other head and neck (10%), and miscellaneous other sites (22%). RMS often presents as a mass, but signs and symptoms can vary widely depending on the site of the primary tumor. Genitourinary tumors may present with hematuria, urinary tract obstruction, and/or a scrotal or vaginal mass. Tumors that arise in the retroperitoneum and mediastinum can become quite large before producing signs and symptoms. Parameningeal tumors may present with cranial nerve dysfunction, symptoms of sinusitis, ear discharge, headaches, and facial pain. Orbital tumors often present with orbital swelling and proptosis. Extremity tumors generally present as a rapidly enlarging, firm mass in the relevant tissue. The cancer&#x27;s prevalence in the head, face, and neck will often allow for earlier signs of the disease simply due to the obvious nature of tumors in these locations. Despite the varying presentation and typically aggressive nature of the disease, RMS has the potential to be diagnosed and treated early. The fourth IRSG study found that 23% of patients were diagnosed in time for a complete resection of their cancer, and 15% had resection with only minimal remnants of the diseased cells.

==Risk factors==
Rhabdomyosarcoma is difficult to diagnose. Risk factors that increase the likelihood of this cancer include inherited disorders such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Neurofibromatosis type 1, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Costello syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and DICER1 syndrome.

== Genetic ==
There are multiple genetic lesions associated with rhabdomyosarcoma, but there has been little consistent data demonstrating an association between specific genetic abnormalities and outcome. However, alveolar and embryonal types of RMS can be distinguished cytogenetically, and identification of specific genetic lesions can allow for accurate classification of the ARMS subtype when the histopathological findings are equivocal or unclear. This is valuable for clinical practice as the alveolar type presents a higher risk to the patient and will often require more aggressive treatment than the embryonal type. Thus, ARMS is also referred to as Fusion Positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS). Up to 90% of alveolar RMS cases present with a translocations of t(2;13)(q35, q14) or, less commonly, t(1;13)(p36, q15). Both involve the translocation of a DNA binding domain of either &quot;PAX3&quot; or &quot;PAX7&quot;&quot;,&quot; a member of the Paired Box family of transcription factors, to a transactivation site on &quot;FOXO1&quot; (previously known as &quot;FKHR)&quot;, a member of the forkhead/HNF-3 transcription factor family. The t(2;13) translocation results in a fusion of the &quot;PAX3&quot; gene with &quot;FOXO1&quot;, while the t(1;13) translocation involves the fusion of &quot;PAX7&quot; with &quot;FOXO1&quot;. &quot;PAX3&quot; has a demonstrated role in muscle cell development, which supports its potential role in RMS. The t(2;13) translocation can result in the &quot;PAX3-FKHR&quot; fusion product, which is indicative of classic cystic ARMS. Cases of FP-RMS are associated with a poorer prognosis than fusion-negative RMS.

The fusion protein presents a potential therapeutic target, and in recent years more research has been conducted to clarify the role of &quot;PAX3-FOXO1&quot; in FP-RMS. PAX3-FOXO1 is now known to drive key oncogenes such as MYC and MYCN by creating long-distance genetic interactions by super enhancers. In this context, PAX3-FOXO1 both (1) drives the expression of &quot;MYC&quot;, &quot;MYCN&quot; and even &quot;MYOD1&quot; (a transcription factor highly expressed in all RMS subtypes) but also (2) co-binds with these master transcription factors at super enhancers to support cancer growth. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that FP-RMS subtypes were especially sensitive to inhibitors (such as JQ1) of a super enhancer bound protein BRD4.

Embryonal RMS usually presents with a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the short arm of chromosome 11 (p11,15.5). This region is associated with multiple oncogenes, and the potential loss-of-function of this region is likely associated with the loss of a tumor suppressor. However, the specific consequences of this LOH at (p11,15.5) have yet to be determined. The short arm of chromosome 11 is also the site of the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (IGF-2), which is often over-expressed in RMS.

The loss-of-function of tumor suppressor p53 is associated with many cancers including rhabdomyosarcoma, and approximately 50% of RMS cases have been shown to carry some form of mutation to the P53 gene. Other oncogenes often associated with rhabdomyosarcoma, albeit with less frequency, include &quot;NMYC&quot;, &quot;NRAS&quot;, &quot;KRAS&quot;, &quot;P16&quot;, and c-&quot;Met.&quot; One study showed that 35% of embryonal RMS tumors contained activating mutations in either &quot;NRAS&quot; or &quot;KRAS&quot; and it is worth noting that &quot;ras&quot; activation has been shown to block myogenic differentiation, which could help explain its potential role in rhabdomyosarcogenesis. More recently, a mechanistic and epigenetic link between mutant RAS isoforms and a block of myogenic differentiation has been demonstrated. Furthermore, it has been shown that this differentiation block can be overcome with a clinical stage inhibitor of the MAP kinase pathway known as a MEK inhibitor.

== Diagnosis ==
Rhabdomyosarcoma is often difficult to diagnose due to its similarities to other cancers and varying levels of differentiation. It is loosely classified as one of the small-blue-round-cell tumors due to its appearance on an H&amp;E stain. Other cancers that share this classification include neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and lymphoma, and a diagnosis of RMS requires confident elimination of these morphologically similar diseases. The defining diagnostic trait for RMS is confirmation of malignant skeletal muscle differentiation with myogenesis (presenting as a plump, pink cytoplasm) under light microscopy. Cross striations may or may not be present. Accurate diagnosis is usually accomplished through immunohistochemical staining for muscle-specific proteins such as myogenin, muscle-specific actin, desmin, D-myosin, and myoD1. Myogenin, in particular, has been shown to be highly specific to RMS, although the diagnostic significance of each protein marker may vary depending on the type and location of the malignant cells. The alveolar type of RMS tends to have stronger muscle-specific protein staining. Electron microscopy may also aid in diagnosis, with the presence of actin and myosin or Z bands pointing to a positive diagnosis of RMS. Classification into types and subtypes is accomplished through further analysis of cellular morphology (alveolar spacings, presence of cambium layer, aneuploidy, etc.) as well as genetic sequencing of tumor cells. Some genetic markers, such as the &quot;PAX3-FKHR&quot; fusion gene expression in alveolar RMS, can aid in diagnosis. Open biopsy is usually required to obtain sufficient tissue for accurate diagnosis. All findings must be considered in context, as no one trait is a definitive indicator for RMS.

=== Staging ===
Following diagnosis and histopathological analysis, various imaging techniques may be used, including MRI, ultrasound, and a bone scan in order to determine the extent of local invasion and any metastasis. Further investigational techniques may be necessary depending on tumor sites. A parameningeal presentation of RMS will often require a lumbar puncture to rule out metastasis to the meninges. A paratesticular presentation will often require an abdominal CT to rule out local lymph node involvement, and so on. Outcomes are strongly tied to the extent of the disease, and its early mapping is important for treatment planning.

The current staging system for rhabdomyosarcoma is unusual relative to most cancers. It utilizes a modified TNM (tumor-nodes-metastasis) system originally developed by the IRSG. This system accounts for tumor size (&gt; or &lt;5 cm), lymph node involvement, tumor site, and presence of metastasis. It grades on a scale of 1 to 4 based on these criteria. In addition, patients are sorted by clinical group (from the clinical groups from the IRSG studies) based on the success of their first surgical resection. The current Children&#x27;s Oncology Group protocols for the treatment of RMS categorize patients into one of four risk categories based on tumor grade and clinical group, and these risk categories have been shown to be highly predictive of outcome.
== Treatment ==

Treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma is a multidisciplinary practice involving surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and possibly immunotherapy. Surgery is generally the first step in a combined therapeutic approach. Resectability varies depending on tumor site, and RMS often presents in sites that don&#x27;t allow for full surgical resection without significant morbidity and loss of function. Less than 20% of RMS tumors are fully resected with negative margins. Rhabdomyosarcomas are highly chemosensitive, with approximately 80% of cases responding to chemotherapy. Multi-agent chemotherapy is indicated for all patients with rhabdomyosarcoma. Before the use of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy involving chemotherapeutic agents, treatment solely by surgical means had a survival rate of &lt;20%. Modern survival rates with adjuvant therapy are approximately 60–70%.

There are two main methods of chemotherapy treatment for RMS. There is the VAC regimen, consisting of vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide, and the IVA regimen, consisting of ifosfamide, vincristine, and actinomycin D. These drugs are administered in 9–15 cycles depending on the staging of the disease and other therapies used. Other drug and therapy combinations may also show additional benefits. The addition of doxorubicin and cisplatin to the VAC regimen was shown to increase survival rates of patients with alveolar-type, early-stage RMS in the IRS study III, and this same addition improved survival rates and doubled bladder salvage rates in patients with stage III RMS of the bladder. In children and young adults with stage IV metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, a Cochrane review has found no evidence to support the use of high-dose chemotherapy as a standard therapy.

Radiation therapy, which kills cancer cells with focused doses of radiation, is often indicated in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma, and the exclusion of this treatment from disease management has been shown to increase recurrence rates. Radiation therapy is used when resecting the entirety of the tumor would involve disfigurement or loss of important organs (eye, bladder, etc.). Generally, in any case where a lack of complete resection is suspected, radiation therapy is indicated. Administration is usually following 6–12 weeks of chemotherapy if tumor cells are still present. The exception to this schedule is the presence of parameningeal tumors that have invaded the brain, spinal cord, or skull. In these cases, radiation treatment is started immediately. In some cases, special radiation treatment may be required. Brachytherapy, or the placement of small, radioactive &quot;seeds&quot; directly inside the tumor or cancer site, is often indicated in children with tumors of sensitive areas such as the testicles, bladder, or vagina. This reduces scattering and the degree of late toxicity following dosing. Radiation therapy is more often indicated in higher stage classifications.

Immunotherapy is a more recent treatment modality that is still in development. This method involves recruiting and training the patient&#x27;s immune system to target the cancer cells. This can be accomplished through administering small molecules designed to pull immune cells towards the tumors, taking immune cells pulled from the patient, and training to attack tumors through presentation with tumor antigens or other experimental methods. A specific example here would be presenting some of the patient&#x27;s dendritic cells, which direct the immune system to foreign cells, with the PAX3-FKHR fusion protein in order to focus the patient&#x27;s immune system to the malignant RMS cells. All cancers, including rhabdomyosarcoma, could benefit from this new, immune-based approach.

== Prognostic ==
Prognosis in rhabdomyosarcoma patients has been shown to be dependent on age, tumor site, resectability of tumor, tumor size, regional lymph node involvement, presence of metastasis, site and extent of metastasis, and biological and histopathological characteristics of the tumor cells. Survival after recurrence is poor, and new salvage therapy strategies are needed.
== Epidemiology ==
Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children as well as the third most common solid tumor in children. Recent estimates place the incidence of the disease at approximately 4.5 case per 1 million children/adolescents with approximately 250 new cases in the United States each year. With the vast majority of cases of RMS occurring in children or adolescents, two-thirds of reported cases occur in youths under the age of 10. RMS also occurs slightly more often in males than in females, with a ratio of approximately 1.3–1.5:1. In addition, slightly lower prevalence of the disease has been reported in black and Asian children relative to white children. In most cases, there are no clear predisposing risk factors for the development of RMS. It tends to occur sporadically with no obvious cause. However, RMS has been correlated with familial cancer syndromes and congenital abnormalities including neurofibromatosis type 1, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Li–Fraumeni syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome, and Costello syndrome. It has also been associated with parental use of cocaine and marijuana.

== History ==
Rhabdomyosarcoma was first described by Weber, a German physician, in 1845, but it was not until the paper by Arthur Stout in 1946 that RMS was formally classified. The first thirty years of investigation were conducted by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group (IRSG), an independent National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded cooperative that has become a part of the Children&#x27;s Oncology Group.

== Research ==

Cancer stem cells of rhabdomyosarcoma have been identified and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 has been suggested as their marker. Preclinical animal studies that try to use conditionally replicating adenoviruses against such cells are in progress.
Epigenetic therapy for rhabdomyosarcoma is becoming more important. A recent study by Bharathy et al. found that deacetylase inhibitor, entinostat works in aggressive subtype, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS) by specifically blocking the activity of HDAC3, thereby preventing epigenetic suppression of a microRNA that inhibits PAX3:FOXO1 translation. These findings and ongoing clinical trials (ADVL1513) shows promise for an effective therapy for some patients with aRMS.

<text>Black Box is an abstract board game for one or two players, which simulates shooting rays into a black box to deduce the locations of &quot;atoms&quot; hidden inside. It was created by Eric Solomon. The board game was published by Waddingtons from the mid-1970s and by Parker Brothers in the late 1970s. The game can also be played with pen and paper, and there are numerous computer implementations for many different platforms, including one which can be run from the Emacs text editor.

&quot;Black Box&quot; was inspired by the work of Godfrey Hounsfield who was awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his invention of the CAT scanner.

==Objective==

&quot;Black Box&quot; is played on a two-dimensional grid. The object of the game is to discover the location of objects (&quot;atoms&quot;, represented by metal balls in the Waddingtons game and by yellow balls in the Parker Brothers version) hidden within the grid, by the use of the minimum number of probes (&quot;rays&quot;). The atoms are hidden by a person in a two-player game. In a solitaire game, they are either hidden by a computer or they are pre-hidden; in this case, the results of various probes are resolved by looking them up in a book. The seeker designates where the ray enters the black box and the hider (or computer or book) announces the result (a &quot;hit&quot;, &quot;reflection&quot;, or &quot;detour&quot;/&quot;miss&quot;). This result is marked by the seeker, who uses these to deduce the position of the atoms in the black box.

==Rules==
The most common configuration for novice players is four atoms in an 8×8 grid. At left is a sample black box in this configuration.

There are 32 input positions in an 8×8 grid, eight each at the top, bottom, right, and left. A beam is &quot;fired&quot; into one of these positions and the result is used to help deduce the location of a known number of hidden atoms.

===Hit===
Atoms interact with rays in three ways. A direct impact on an atom by a ray is a &quot;hit&quot;. Thus, ray 1 fired into the box configuration at left strikes an atom directly, generating a &quot;hit&quot;, designated by an &quot;H&quot;. A ray which hits an atom does not emerge from the box.

===Deflection===
The interaction resulting from a ray which does not actually hit an atom, but which passes directly to one side of the ball is called a &quot;deflection&quot;. The angle of deflection for this ray/atom interaction is 90 degrees. Ray 2 is deflected by the atom at left, exiting the box as shown.

===Reflection===
The final type of interaction of a ray with an atom is a &quot;reflection&quot;, designated by an &quot;R&quot;. This occurs in two circumstances. If an atom is at the edge of the grid, any ray which is aimed into the grid directly beside it causes a reflection.

Rays 3 and 4 at left would each generate a reflection, due to the atom at the edge. Ray 5 would be a hit on the atom.

===Double deflection===
The other circumstance leading to a reflection is when two deflections cancel out. In the grid at left, ray 6 results in a reflection due to its interaction with the atoms in the grid.

===Miss===
There are also misses. Ray 7 at left, for instance, interacts with no atoms in the grid.

===Detour===
Rays that do not result in hits or reflections are called &quot;detours&quot;. These may be single or multiple deflections, or misses. A detour has an entry and an exit location, while hits and reflections only have an entry location for a hit, and a single entry/exit location for a reflection.

Of course, more complex situations result when these behaviors interact. Ray 8 results in two deflections, as does ray 9.
Some rays travel a twisted course, like ray 1 at left.
Notice that this complex set of five deflections above looks exactly like a single deflection, as shown by ray 2 at left. Things are not always as simple as they seem within a black box.
Reflections and hits can be more complex, too. Ray 2 gets deflected by the first atom, reflected by the next two atoms and again deflected by the original atom, yielding a reflection.
Ray 3 below gets deflected by the first atom, then by the second atom, and then hits the third atom, yielding a hit.
The complete set of interactions of rays with the original sample black box is shown at left. Note that for detours, the input and output locations are interchangeable - it does not matter if ray 2 below enters the box from the left side, or the top.
==Scoring==
Each entry and exit location counts as a point. Hits and reflections therefore cost one point, while detours cost two points. When the seeker guesses the location of the atoms in the grid, each misidentified atom position costs penalty points: ten in the original Waddingtons rules, five in the Parker Brothers version and most computer editions.

Different atom positions lead to different average scores - a very easy four-ball game might average eight or nine points to solve, while a very hard game might average 18 points.

==Variants==

The most common variant of &quot;Black Box&quot; is played on an 8×8 grid with five (or more) atoms. Five-atom configurations allow for positions that cannot be unambiguously determined by probes. The grid at left shows an example of this.

If the fifth atom is in any of the four positions marked by the X, no ray can ever determine where it is located, because it is shielded from all directions by the surrounding atoms. The addition of more atoms allows for more complex indeterminate configurations, but also allows for more intriguing interactions.
It is possible to &quot;hide&quot; a ball with this four-atom configuration.

It is not ambiguous, however.

&quot;Black Box&quot; can also be played with different-sized grids, such as 10×10 or 12×12 grids.

A related class of computer puzzle games feature different types of obstacles concealed in the box, which affect rays in varying ways — such as mirrors which reflect only a direct-hit ray, or prisms which split one ray into two. The GNOME game GFingerPoken and one section of the Macintosh game &quot;System&#x27;s Twilight&quot; fall into this class.

==Video game==
A version of the game was created for the BBC Micro home computer by Ben Finn (who would go on to co-write Sibelius) and submitted in the &#x27;design a game&#x27; competition on ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Saturday Show&quot;. As joint winner of the competition, the game was officially licensed from Waddingtons and published (along with fellow winner &quot;Gambit&quot; by the Oliver Twins) by Acornsoft in 1984.

<text>Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition (), or simply the Official Opposition (), is usually the second-largest party (or group of parties) in the House of Commons. Typically, it is the largest party of the parliamentary opposition, which is composed of members of Parliament (MPs) who are not in government.

The Official Opposition is viewed as the caucus tasked with keeping the government in check. It is also generally viewed as the alternative government or &quot;government in waiting&quot;. The Official Opposition maintains a shadow cabinet, with the leader of the Official Opposition at its head, of members of Parliament (MPs) and senators who often have the same portfolio areas of interest as actual ministers. The spokesperson for each portfolio is known as an opposition critic. In the event the government loses the confidence of the House or the Official Opposition party wins a general election, the party is ready to become the government.

The current Official Opposition is the caucus of the Conservative Party, assuming the role following the 2015 federal election. The Opposition is led by Pierre Poilievre, who became Conservative leader following the 2022 leadership election.

==Nomenclature==
The formal title of &quot;Official Opposition&quot; is used in the &quot;Standing Orders of the House of Commons&quot;. The Official Opposition is sometimes also referred to as the &quot;Loyal Opposition&quot; to express the idea that, although the group may be against the sitting government, it remains loyal to the Crown (the embodiment of the Canadian state) and thus to Canada.

Former leader of the Official Opposition, Michael Ignatieff, explains:

== History ==
After the 1921 election, the Progressive Party, a looseknit largely agrarian &quot;protest&quot; party, won the second largest number of seats to William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberals, but declined to be the Official Opposition because of their lack of national organization. The third-place Conservative Party, led by Arthur Meighen, thus became the Official Opposition.

As a result of the 1925 election, the Official Opposition was actually the largest party in the House of Commons, the Conservatives. The Liberals, led by Mackenzie King, were able to form a minority government despite the fact that they had a dozen fewer seats than the Conservatives because King&#x27;s Liberals were able to win the support of the Progressives to remain in government. Similarly, in Ontario, the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party had the largest caucus but were relegated to official opposition not long after the 1985 election, as their minority government was defeated on a motion of non-confidence. The Ontario Liberal Party, the second largest party, governed from 1985 to 1987 with supply provided by the Ontario New Democratic Party.

In 1993, the Reform Party challenged whether the Quebec sovereigntist Bloc Québécois could hold the position of official opposition. The Speaker ruled in favour of the Bloc, as they held two more seats than Reform. During the Bloc&#x27;s time as the official opposition, Quebec issues on national unity dominated Question Period, often to the irritation of the other opposition parties (indeed, Reform was the only other caucus that met official party status, with the NDP and PC parties falling short of that threshold). However, Reform was considered to be main opposition to the Liberals on all other issues that were not specific to Quebec. In 1995, when Bloc leader Lucien Bouchard&#x27;s position as Opposition Leader granted him a meeting with the visiting American president, Bill Clinton, Reform leader Preston Manning was also given a meeting with Clinton in order to diffuse Bouchard&#x27;s separatist leverage.

In 1987, the Liberals won every seat in the 51st New Brunswick Legislative Assembly. To ensure the proper functioning of the parliamentary system, Premier Frank McKenna named several members of his own caucus, led by Camille Thériault, to serve as the Official Opposition. The government also allowed the Progressive Conservative Party, which finished second place in the election in the number of votes received, to submit written questions to ministers during Question Period.

==Privileges==
The Official Opposition party has advantages over other opposition parties in the House. They are assigned to speak first after the government, and receive more time in question period than other opposition parties. It also gets more office space, funding for research, and a larger staff than other parties.

The leader of the Opposition has an official residence in Ottawa known as Stornoway and the salary and similar privileges to those of a cabinet minister. Additionally, the leader and other shadow cabinet members have the privilege of meeting with visiting foreign dignitaries, which is not always granted to members of smaller parties.

==Senate==
There is also an Official Opposition in the Senate of Canada. This is the largest party in the Senate that is not in government. As the governing party is determined in the House of Commons, the Official Opposition in the Senate may actually be larger than the government party in the Senate. It is customary, however, for the Senate to pass legislation approved in the House of Commons even if the government has a minority in the Senate. Although the Senate nominally has the power to block most legislation (excepting bills which would trigger a non-confidence motion if defeated in the House, such as money bills), this power is rarely exercised in practice.

The party that forms Official Opposition in the Senate is not necessarily the same party as in the House of Commons. From 1993 to 2003, the Official Opposition in the Senate was the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, even though the Bloc Québécois was the Official Opposition in the House from 1993 to 1997, followed by the Reform Party of Canada, and then the Canadian Alliance from 1997 to 2003. This is because the BQ, and Reform Party had no Senators. However, when Senator Gerry St. Germain crossed the floor from the Progressive Conservatives to the Canadian Alliance in 2000, he argued that he should be recognized as the leader of the Opposition in the Senate as the Canadian Alliance formed the Official Opposition in the House of Commons. The speaker of the Senate of Canada ruled against him, however, as the Progressive Conservatives were the larger opposition party.

<doc id="549900" wikidata="Q1483951" url="?curid=549900" title="Malignancy">
<text>Malignancy () is the tendency of a medical condition to become progressively worse; the term is most familiar as a characterization of cancer.

A &quot;malignant&quot; tumor contrasts with a non-cancerous benign tumor in that a malignancy is not self-limited in its growth, is capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues.

A benign tumor has none of those properties, but may still be harmful to health. The term benign in more general medical use characterizes a condition or growth that is not cancerous, i.e. does not spread to other parts of the body or invade nearby tissue. Sometimes the term is used to suggest that a condition is not dangerous or serious.

Malignancy in cancers is characterized by anaplasia, invasiveness, and metastasis. Malignant tumors are also characterized by genome instability, so that cancers, as assessed by whole genome sequencing, frequently have between 10,000 and 100,000 mutations in their entire genomes. Cancers usually show tumour heterogeneity, containing multiple subclones. They also frequently have reduced expression of DNA repair enzymes due to epigenetic methylation of DNA repair genes or altered microRNAs that control DNA repair gene expression.

Tumours can be detected through the visualisation or sensation of a lump on the body. In cases where there is no obvious representation of a lump, a mammogram or an MRI test can be used to determine the presence of a tumour. In the case of an existing tumour, a biopsy would then be required to make a diagnosis and distinguish whether the tumour is malignant or benign. This involves examination of a small sample of the tissue in a laboratory. If detected as a malignant tumour, treatment is necessary; treatment during early stages is most effective. Forms of treatment include chemotherapy, surgery, photoradiation, and hyperthermia, amongst various others.

==Signs and symptoms==
When malignant cells form, symptoms do not typically appear until there has been a significant growth of the mass. Once signs and symptoms do arise, they are dependent on the location, size and type of malignancy. Usually, it is quite general and can be associated with other illnesses or diseases and thus, can be difficult to diagnose or can be misdiagnosed.

Signs include observable or measurable aspects such as weight loss (without trying), a fever or unusual bleeding. On the other hand, symptoms are felt internally by the individual such as fatigue or changes in appetite. A general list of common signs and symptoms includes pain (headaches or bone aches), skin changes (new moles or bumps), coughing and unusual bleeding. There are also signs and symptoms specific to females including belly pain and bloating or breast changes i.e., the formation of a lump. Signs and symptoms specific to males include pain or growths in the scrotum or difficulty urinating.

==Causes==
Malignant cells often evolve due to a combination of reasons rather than one definitive reason. Reasons which can explain their development include genetics and family history, triggers such as infectious diseases, and exposure to risk factors.

===Triggers===
Infectious diseases play a role in the development of malignancy, with agents of infectious disease being able to produce a multitude of malignant cells. These include bacterial causes, fungal and parasitic causes and, viral causes. Bacteria, fungi and similar pathogens have the ability to form an environment within states of chronic inflammation which gives rise to oncogenic potential. Viral agents are able to assist the formation of malignant tumours due to a mechanism of cell transformation. This cell transformation can occur through either &quot;DNA integration or cellular-DNA alteration of growth regulator genes&quot;. Inflammation can also play a role in triggering malignancy as it can promote stages of tumour formation. The main purpose of inflammation is to repair tissue, defend the body against pathogens and regenerate cells. At the same time, inflammatory cells can also interact with malignant cells to form an inflammatory tumour microenvironment. This environment increases the likelihood of forming malignant cells through blockage of anti-tumour immunity. Once this occurs, the inflammatory tumour microenvironment begins to send out tumour-promoting signals to epithelial cells, triggering the formation of malignant cells.

===Risk factors===
Traditional risk factors of developing malignancy include smoking, sun exposure and, having a history of cancer in the family. Other risk factors include developing post-transplant malignancy which occurs subsequent to solid organ transplantations.

====Post-transplant malignancy====
Individuals who undergo organ transplant surgery have an increased risk of developing malignancy in comparison to the general population. The most common form of malignancy being &quot;nonmelanoma skin cancer and, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;. The different types of malignancy developed post-transplant depend on which organ was transplanted. This is linked to recipients being at a higher risk when exposed to traditional risk factors as well as, the type and intensity of the operation, the duration of their immunosuppression post-operation and, the risk of developing oncogenic viral infections.

==Management==
There are various treatment forms available to help manage malignancy. Common treatments include chemotherapy, radiation and surgical procedures. Photoradiation and hyperthermia are also used as treatment forms to kill or reduce malignant cells. A large portion of patients are at risk of death when diagnosed with malignancy as the disease has usually progressed for a number of years before detection.

===Surgery===
Surgery can help manage or treat malignancy by either removing the tumour, localising it and/or determining whether there has been a spread to other organs. When undertaking surgery for malignancy, there are six major objectives which are considered. These include &quot;prevention of cancer, diagnosis and staging of disease, disease cure, tumour debulking, symptom palliation and patient rehabilitation&quot;.

Surgical prevention of cancer largely consists of removing the organ at risk of developing malignancy. This would occur if an individual is predisposed to the formation of malignant cells as a result of inherited genetic mutations and, acquired diseases.

Surgical diagnosis of malignancy involves completing a biopsy. This process requires a sufficient amount of tissue to make a confident diagnosis and, the handling of specimen to expand information provided from testing. Biopsies are categorised into four different processes: &quot;fine-needle aspirate (FNA), core needle, incisional and, excisional&quot;.

Curative surgery (also known as primary surgery) can be conducted when the malignant tumour has only invaded one area of the body. The objective is to remove the entirety of the malignant cells without violating the tumour; if the tumour is violated, the risk of both tumour spillage and wound implantation would increase.

The surgical procedure of tumour debulking can be undertaken to increase the effectiveness of postoperative forms of treatment. Symptom palliation and patient rehabilitation do not play a role in controlling or reducing malignancy growth rather, they increase the patient&#x27;s quality of life.

===Photoradiation===
Hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD) is a drug which was developed to be absorbed by malignant cells and only becomes active when exposed to light. It is commonly used to identify and localise cancers as when it is under activation of blue light the red fluorescence of the malignant tumour (due to the HPD) can be observed easily.

The combination of HPD with red light (photoradiation) has been used on various malignant tumours including malignant melanomas and carcinomas on a range of different organs including the breast and colon. This form of treatment produces a singlet oxygen through the photodynamic process; where the oxygen molecule exists in an electronically excited state. The singlet oxygen is a cytotoxic agent which holds the ability to eradicate malignant cells by preventing both nucleic acid and protein synthesis. The treatment process also utilises HPD&#x27;s capability of accumulating at higher levels in malignant tissues compared to most other tissues.

In the case of deeply pigmented or larger tumours, a stronger course of this treatment process is required in order to be effective.

===Hyperthermia===
Malignancy can be treated through the use of hyperthermia by applying either surgical perfusion or interstitial techniques to the body. The use of this treatment type largely depends on the fact that malignant and normal cells have differing responses to the energy source used. This dependency is due to the intracellular changes which occur during hyperthermia; as the nucleic acids, cell membrane and cytoskeleton within each cell is affected indirectly and/or through multiple pathways. The combination of these intracellular changes means there is no specific target of cell death in the hyperthermic process.

===Chemotherapy===
Chemotherapy is commonly used as either the primary treatment or in conjunction with other treatment forms such as radiotherapy or surgery. It can be administered through &quot;injection, intra-arterial (IA), intraperitoneal (IP), intrathecal (IT), intravenous (IV), topical or oral&quot;.

The purpose of chemotherapy is to use cytotoxic agents which kill rapidly dividing cells within the body. It targets the cellular mechanisms which allow the development of malignancy throughout the body. There are no specific areas which are targeted and so, there is a lack of differentiation between normal and malignant cells, resulting in a range of side effects. This includes bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal problems and alopecia. Some side effects are specific to the anticancer drug used, the most common being bone marrow suppression as bone marrow has the ability to divide rapidly due to high growth fraction. This is because anticancer drugs have the highest activity in high growth fraction tissues.

Alkylating agents are used in chemotherapy as these are chemically reactive drugs which form covalent bonds when reacting with DNA. This results in breaks within DNA strands causing either inter-strand or intra-strand DNA cross-linking. The sub-classes of alkylating agents are &quot;nitrogen mustards, oxazaphosphorines, alkyl alkane, sulphonates, nitrosoureas, tetrazines and aziridines.&quot;

==Epidemiology==
Malignancy has been a constant global health concern for a number of years, resulting in significant social and economic impacts on individuals with malignancy and their families. The risk of developing malignancy is 20.2%. In 2018, 18 million patients were diagnosed with a malignant tumour with lung, breast and prostate being the most common form. Additionally, there were approximately 10 million mortalities due to cancer in 2020 and, there is an overall trend which demonstrated that malignant mortality has increased by 28% over the past 15 years.

Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate in comparison to other forms of cancer, with the leading cause of development due to smoking. The number of smokers in China is rapidly increasing with tobacco killing approximately 3000 people each day. The diagnosis of lung cancer is most common within the 50–59-year age bracket. Further, it caused 1.8 million deaths in 2020 alone.

In those aged 14 or younger, leukaemia is the most frequent form of malignancy with the brain and nervous system subsequent. These individuals account for approximately 1% of the cancer mortality rate – about 110,000 children each year. In the 15–49-year-old age bracket the most common form of malignancy is breast cancer with liver and lung cancer following. Finally, those aged 60 and over mainly develop lung, colorectal, stomach and liver malignancy.

Uses of &quot;malignant&quot; in oncology include:
*&quot;Malignancy&quot;, &quot;malignant neoplasm&quot; and &quot;malignant tumor&quot; are synonymous with cancer
*&quot;Malignant ascites&quot;
*&quot;Malignant transformation&quot;

Non-oncologic disorders referred to as &quot;malignant&quot; include:
*&quot;Malignant hypertension&quot;
*&quot;Malignant hyperthermia&quot;
*&quot;Malignant otitis externa&quot;
*&quot;Malignant tertian malaria&quot; (malaria caused specifically by &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;)
*&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;

<text>Possession is a 2002 romantic mystery drama film written and directed by Neil LaBute and starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart. It is based on the 1990 by British author A. S. Byatt, who won the Booker Prize for it the year it was published.

==Synopsis==
Literary scholars American Roland Michell of the British Museum and British Maud Bailey independently find that the socially antagonistic relationship between the Victorian era poets Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte may have concealed a secret connection as lovers. Ash is traditional and conservative and LaMotte is a freethinking bisexual. Rival scholars become aware of their efforts and each seeks to be the first at the public disclosure of this major finding about the poets. In a parallel relationship, Michell and Bailey have their own deepening connection.

==Cast==

==Development==
Three early drafts of the film&#x27;s screenplay were written by American playwright David Henry Hwang in the 1990s, but the project languished in pre-production for years. Directors such as Sydney Pollack and Gillian Armstrong worked on the film and eventually gave up before LaBute became director. LaBute made drastic changes to the story, based partially on notes that original author Byatt had made on earlier drafts of the screenplay, as she recognized that Roland Michell had to &quot;exist on screen&quot; in a different way than he did in the book.

LaBute recalled:
 
LaBute changed Roland&#x27;s nationality from British to American, and made him more brash and active. He denied that this was &quot;shameless pandering to the audience. ... in part, it was [just] more comfortable for me to write Roland that way.&quot;

==Casting==
Ralph Fiennes was approached for the role as Randolph Ash that eventually went to Jeremy Northam.

==Reception==
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 63%, with an average rating of 6.30/10, based on 156 reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;It&#x27;s perhaps a bit tame and uninspiring, considering its subject matter, but &quot;Possession&quot; manages enough romance and period intrigue to satisfy most fans of its source material.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars and a half out of four.

Daniel Zalewski of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that director LaBute, &quot;known for savagely blunt stage and screen dramas ... has here infused a British novelist&#x27;s main characters with the same stutter-and-slang rhythms, male-bonding repartée and sarcastic volleys that define his own distinctly American work.&quot; He said: &quot;In the end, Mr. LaBute&#x27;s grafting of his own sensibility onto Roland creates a weird tonal clash.&quot;

Jamie Russell of the BBC wrote, &quot;Lacking the intelligence of an arthouse picture, or the classy sheen of a British production, &quot;Possession&quot; isn&#x27;t possessed of anything other than over-wrought emotionalism and unintentional silliness.&quot;

The film grossed $14,815,898 worldwide.

==Releases==
The film has been released on DVD with subtitles and captions.

<text>The Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway (L&amp;MVLR) was a narrow gauge railway in Staffordshire, England that operated between 1904 and 1934. The line mainly carried milk from dairies in the region, acting as a feeder to the system. It also provided passenger services to the small villages and beauty spots along its route. The line was built to a narrow gauge and to the light rail standards provided by the Light Railways Act 1896 to reduce construction costs.

The route of the line is now a foot- and cycle- path.

== Route ==

The North Staffordshire Railway&#x27;s branch from Leek ended at Waterhouses (). The L&amp;MVLR continued from an end-on junction with this line. It ran for down the valley of the River Hamps as far as Beeston Tor, before turning up the limestone gorge that the River Manifold had formed, through to Hulme End (). The line had a large number of stations in a relatively short distance, and there were refreshment rooms at Thor&#x27;s Cave and Beeston Tor. In all the line crossed the river Manifold dozens of times – including nine times in the short section between Sparrowlee and Beeston Tor. 

All stations had rather grand signs (sometimes grander than the facilities) and platforms were just high. All stations had sidings except for Beeston Tor and Redhurst Halt.

* Hulme End station was a large building, with adjacent engine and coach sheds (two roads in each). On the timetable it was described as &quot;Hulme End for Hartington&quot;. Hartington being some distant.
* Ecton station had both a standard gauge and narrow gauge siding, with a narrow gauge extension to the milk factory. The presence of the railway did not kick-start the local mining industry, as hoped.
* Butterton station (also known locally as Ecton Lea) had a waiting room. There was a siding.
* Wetton Mill station had a station with waiting room, and a standard gauge siding. (It had ceased to be a working mill before the railway was built.)
* At Redhurst Halt an old coach served as a waiting room. There was no siding here.
* Thor&#x27;s Cave station largely served Wetton village. It had a waiting room. Its refreshment room was moved to Wetton in 1917.
* Grindon station, located at Weags Bridge, had a loop containing a standard gauge siding.
* Beeston Tor station had no siding, but a refreshment room.
* Sparrowlee station served Lee House Farm, but nowhere else, and there was not even a waiting room here. The siding included a standard gauge section.
* At Waterhouses station the platform had booking offices, and there was a goods shed. There were two short loops, and three short sidings which joined with standard gauge lines. The site of the station is now a carpark for the Manifold Trail; a road-widening scheme in the 1960s removed some of the evidence of the L&amp;MR station.

== History ==


Authorised by the , this was the narrow gauge section of the Leek Light Railways. The railway ran for 30 years, from 1904 to 1934. Its engineer was Everard Calthrop, a leading advocate of narrow gauge railways and builder of the Barsi Light Railway in India; the chairman of the company was Charles Bill, MP for Leek. A private concern, it was run by the North Staffordshire Railway on a percentage basis, but it later came under the control of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923.

The line was constructed to a high standard, Calthrop applying lessons learned on his other railways. Rail used was 35 lb/yard (17.28 kg/m), and the quality of trackwork is reflected in the fact that no re-laying was ever necessary.

The line was a single track, and most services (which began from Hulme End, where the locomotive sheds were) only involved the use of one engine in steam. There was passing loop at Wetton Mill, but it was never used as such.

At Waterhouses the timetable allowed for connections from Leek.

Trains ran at a maximum speed of , and most halts were run on a request basis. More than this, the train would also often stop to pick up passengers at other places on the lineside footpath, if requested. Timetables mostly show single journey times of 50 minutes (with some showing an hour).

Most outbound freight consisted of milk, in both churns and bulk tankers, and the products of the dairy goods factory at Ecton. In all, some 300 milk churns were handled daily at Waterhouses, and from 1919 a daily milk train ran from Waterhouses to London specifically for this traffic. Latterly milk tanks were used, carried on the transporter wagons. Passenger traffic was minimal – the settlements were mostly some distance from the line – except on Bank Holidays when all the line&#x27;s rolling stock was used to run frequent services to handle the crowds.

There was some talk of extending the line northwards to Buxton, whereby Hulme End (and its engine shed) would become the half-way point of the line, but this never materialised.

The railway was filmed in operation for Pathé News in 1930 under the title &quot;A quaint little Railway&quot;.

== Locomotives and rolling stock ==
The company only had two locomotives: outside-cylindered 2-6-4Ts, built by Kitson &amp; Co. of Leeds in 1904, which were the first 2-6-4T locomotives to run in Britain - the first standard gauge examples being the Great Central Railway&#x27;s Class 1B of 1914. Number 1 was named &quot;E.R. Calthrop&quot;, after the line&#x27;s engineer, and number 2 was named &quot;J.B. Earle&quot; (after the resident engineer). Due to the influence of Calthrop, the locomotives had a somewhat colonial appearance with large headlights which were never used. They also had fittings for cow catchers – again never fitted, and they sported rerailing jacks by the smokebox. The locos were originally painted brown with gold and black lining, after the grouping replaced by crimson lake with gold and black lining. Latterly, after the Great Depression had set in, they ran in plain black.

There was no turntable on the line, and engines ran chimney first towards Waterhouses, despite initial concerns (usually engines on a gradient run the other way, to keep the water over the firebox crown) about the steeper down section (1 in 40) out of Waterhouses. In latter years &quot;E.R. Calthrop&quot; returned from repairs in Crewe facing the other way, as can be seen in later photographs.

There were four coaches; two first class and two brake composite thirds. These were originally painted primrose yellow, and later repainted in Midland red.

Freight wagons consisted of one box van and two open wagons. These open wagons were built by the Leeds Forge Company and were largely designed for the transport of loose milk churns.

Additionally there were also five (four short and one long) transporter wagons, technically &quot;low side bogie goods wagons&quot;. These were supplied by the Cravens Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Company at a cost of £315 each. Uniquely in Britain, in a piggy-back style these were capable of carrying standard gauge wagons – particularly milk tankers and coal wagons – to standard gauge sidings along the route. However, the extra height and width of the loading gauge caused by this arrangement (such as seen in the dimensions of Swainsley Tunnel) undid some of the benefits of using a narrow gauge. This arrangement also meant that standard gauge lengths of track (on sidings) had to be constructed level with the rails of the low transporters.

== Frequency of service ==
Trains started and finished at Hulme End, at the northern end of the line, where the engine sheds were located.

After opening, there were initially three trains daily in each direction. This increased to four on Thursdays and Saturdays (and later to five).
After an attempt by the North Staffordshire Railway as early as 1904 to reduce the service during the winter months to a service only on Wednesdays and Saturdays, the Manifold Company secured an agreement that there should be a minimum of two trains in each direction throughout the year.
On Bank Holidays there were some seven trains daily, and at peak times both engines and all carriages/wagons would be in use - planks and awnings were placed on the open wagons to make them usable by passengers, albeit rather rudimentary. It is recorded that in Whit Week in 1905 some 5000 passengers were carried, and the most intensive service saw trains operating from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Sunday services began in 1905, but stopped in 1930, thus losing much tourist revenue.

The most important traffic on the line was from the United Dairies creamery at Ecton. Most of the product was destined via dedicated milk trains for London. In 1911 were brought in from the L&amp;MVLR growing to in 1922. Initially all the milk was carried in milk churns, which had to be manhandled across the platforms at Waterhouses. But after the First World War the churns were loaded into standard gauge vans taken to and from Ecton on the transporter wagons. Eventually milk tankers were also used, again being transferred between Ecton and Waterhouses on the transporters. The importance of the milk traffic was such that between 1919 and 1926, special milk trains ran direct between Waterhouses and London, rather than the vans being shunted between various trains until the milk reached its ultimate destination. The year after the closure of the creamery in 1933, the L&amp;MVLR closed.

== Closure ==

In 1932 United Dairies closed its Ecton creamery, re-routing milk collection in the area to road transport. Rival company Express Dairies opened a new creamery at Rowsley which took some of the milk production and benefited from a direct connection to standard gauge railway network. The loss of this milk trade removed most of the goods traffic from the line. Furthermore, the developing motor bus services served the villages much better, these settlements being largely on the hills, and often some distance from the line itself. The railway closed briefly in consequence, to re-open briefly in 1933, but closed finally to all traffic on Monday 12 March 1934.

&quot;J.B.Earle&quot; was cut up at the Crewe railway works, whilst &quot;E.R. Calthrop&quot; was used in the track-removal train, which worked south from Hulme End, before being itself cut up at Waterhouses. All that remains of the engines are three name plates.

== The line today – The Manifold Way ==
The &quot;Manifold Valley footpath and cycle way&quot; (now called the Manifold Way) was opened in July 1937 after the handed over the trackbed to Staffordshire County Council. It continues on to Waterhouses, via Hulme End, as a bridlepath, and, being tarmacked throughout, is ideal for wheelchair users, prams, etc. For about , near Wetton Mill, the route is shared with motor traffic where the C-road has been diverted, and this section includes Swainsley Tunnel, built by Sir Thomas Wardle who, despite being a shareholder in the railway, did not want to see it crossing his land. Some spectacular scenery can be found along the route, including Thor&#x27;s Cave, Wetton Hill and Beeston Tor. Many consider that this section bears comparison with the better-known Dovedale a few miles to the east. (The National Trust own several of these sites, as part of their South Peak Estate.)

The Old Light Railway Hotel at Hulme End is now called the Manifold Inn. There are campsites at Hulme End and Wetton Village.

At Ecton Hill a 4,000-year-old copper mine lies along the route; there is still evidence of the railway&#x27;s loading platforms along the route of the old railway. A dairy once stood here and one can still see where milk churns were once loaded onto the morning milk train. The Ecton dairy was famous for its Stilton cheese.

The old engine shed at Hulme End opened as a cafe called The Tea Junction in 2010.

== Modelling ==

Slater&#x27;s Plasticard produce an O16.5 scale kit of the locomotives, with Dorset Kits offering brass coach construction kits together with etched brass kits for both long and short transporter wagons, the open bogie wagons and the bogie van to match in this scale. These can all be built to run on the correct 17.5mm track.

PortWynnstay models of Derby offer a resin outline of the short wheelbase transport car/wagon.

Meridian Models recently produced an (009) scale locomotive body in white metal to fit on a (Minitrix) chassis and Worsley Works produce a basic scratch kit for the carriages, requiring addition of bogies (where applicable), couplings, door handles, and interior to complete. A third company has apparently produced the transporter cars/wagons in this scale.

Roundhouse has produced a live steam model in 1:19 scale, (16mm/foot), of the Kitson 2-6-4 locomotive in the NSR livery.

There is a model at the visitors&#x27; centre in Hulme End along one wall inside the former station building. This shows a representation of Hulme End station, yard and nearby buildings in (009) scale with a short run (scaled down distance) to a model of Butterton station.

<text>Wilhelm von Gottberg (born 30 March 1940) is a German politician of the Alternative for Germany.

Wilhelm von Gottberg was born in 1940, the son of Hans Heinrich von Gottberg (1900–1973) and his wife Gertrud, née Freiin von der Goltz (1908–1997). He was descended of two noble families, the Gottberg family and the Von der Goltz family. He was born in Woopen in Landkreis Bartenstein (now Poland), East Prussia. His family fled from East Prussia during World War II.

Gottberg is president of the Territorial Association of East Prussia (since 1992) and Vice President of the Federation of Expellees (since 1992) in Germany. He is also a member of the board of the Ostpreußische Kulturstiftung, and was mayor of the community of Schnega in Lower Saxony. Gottberg used to be a member of the Christian Democratic Union, but joined the Alternative for Germany in 2016.

<doc id="549948" wikidata="Q2904002" url="?curid=549948" title="Bio-ship Paladin">
<text>Bio-ship Paladin, known in Japan as , is a 1990 horizontally scrolling shoot &#x27;em up arcade game released by UPL and distributed by Sammy Corporation for North American manufacture. It was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive. While the game is essentially a standard horizontally scrolling shoot &#x27;em up, it has an innovation that makes it unique in the genre. The player flies a spaceship (specifically, a bioship) which has the standard forward guns to be found in all horizontal scrollers, but it also possesses a weapon that can be manually targeted with a crosshair, in the same manner as in the game &quot;Missile Command&quot;. This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game. The game saw an almost arcade perfect port on the Mega Drive, albeit with a few changes that actually enhanced the look of the game such as added parallax scrolling backgrounds in the second level. It would eventually see a worldwide re-release as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on August 5, 2021.

==Story==
Taking place on the planet Atlantal, a huge battleship and space fleet suddenly appears and attacks Atlantal&#x27;s largest city, Delila, leaving the city in ruins. The fleet, known only as The Aggressors, continue to spread throughout the planet and further into the galaxy, past the Galegino Path, the sea of flames. To drive out and stop The Aggressors, the best twin-seat space fighter on the planet, the Paladin, is sent out; a powerful bioship that can grow larger in strength and size. The Aggressors are suggested to have come from Earth as the enemies, bosses all have vehicle names of different languages and many of the bosses are actually named after alcoholic drinks.

==Gameplay==

The player controls the Paladin that had a variety of offenses. Unlike most shoot &#x27;em ups, the Paladin had an armor gauge which meant that the ship would not be destroyed with one hit or after brushing up against a foreground object. The ship had a semi-automatic Laser weapon that, when held down, would charge up and unleash a stronger laser blast. The ship also had the Beam weapon. Once selected, players could use a manual aiming crosshair that could be placed anywhere on the screen, allowing the player to shoot any visible enemy fighter.

The player must fight their way through nine levels filled with clever foreground obstacles and waves of enemies. Many of the bosses had to be destroyed by first shooting off their guns, missile launchers and jets before destroying the whole ship. However, there were no Extend bonuses.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Bio-ship Paladin&quot; on their December 15, 1990 issue as being the eleventh most-successful table arcade unit of the month.

<text>Carnal Knowledge is a 1971 American comedy-drama film directed by Mike Nichols and written by Jules Feiffer. It stars Jack Nicholson, Candice Bergen, Art Garfunkel, and Ann-Margret, with Rita Moreno and Cynthia O&#x27;Neal.

==Plot==
In the late 1940s, Amherst College student Sandy meets a Smith College student named Susan at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other&#x27;s company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unbeknownst to Sandy, she is also pursued by Sandy&#x27;s aggressive, womanizing roommate Jonathan, and they eventually have sex. Jonathan tries to persuade Susan not to have sex with Sandy, but after some delays, Susan does sleep with him. Because of this, Susan and Jonathan break up.

Several years after college, Sandy is married to Susan, while Jonathan still searches for his &quot;perfect woman&quot;. Jonathan begins a relationship with Bobbie, a beautiful but shallow woman, but he eventually grows bored with her. Bobbie leaves her job at Jonathan&#x27;s suggestion. She then becomes depressed, spending long hours doing nothing but sleeping in the apartment she shares with Jonathan. The relationship deteriorates. Jonathan berates Bobbie for not cleaning up the apartment while he is out working all day at a nine-to-five job. He claims that he does not understand why break-ups always have to end with &quot;poison&quot;.

Sandy&#x27;s relationship with Susan is faring no better. Sandy is dissatisfied and bored with the physical part of their relationship, even though he and Susan &quot;do all the right things&quot;. He relates how they are &quot;patient with each other&quot; and concludes with a statement that perhaps sex is not &quot;meant to be enjoyable with the person you love&quot;.

Sandy and Susan end their relationship. Sandy begins dating Cindy. Sandy, Cindy, Jonathan, and Bobbie find themselves together at Jonathan&#x27;s apartment, where Sandy complains privately to Jonathan about his sex life with Cindy. Jonathan suggests to Sandy that they trade partners, to &quot;liven things up a bit&quot;. Sandy goes to the bedroom looking for Bobbie. Cindy dances with Jonathan and reprimands him for attempting to bed her with Sandy nearby, but indicates she is open to seeing him on his own, saying he should contact her at a more appropriate time. In the meantime, upset by an earlier fight with Jonathan about her desire to get married, Bobbie has attempted suicide. She is found by Sandy, who calls the hospital to have her taken to intensive care.

In the 1970s, Jonathan presents a slideshow entitled &quot;Ballbusters on Parade&quot; to Sandy and Sandy&#x27;s 18-year-old girlfriend, Jennifer. The slideshow consists of pictures of Jonathan&#x27;s various loves throughout his life. He skips awkwardly over a slide of Susan, but not before Sandy notices. He also shows an image of Bobbie, saying they are divorced and have one child together, and he is paying her alimony. Jennifer leaves in tears.

Some time later, Jonathan solicits a prostitute named Louise, and they go through a ritual dialogue about male–female relationships which is apparently a script written by Jonathan. At the end, Louise recites a monologue (again scripted by Jonathan) praising his power and &quot;perfection&quot;, which apparently has become the only way Jonathan can now get an erection.

==Cast==
* Jack Nicholson as Jonathan Fuerst
* Candice Bergen as Susan
* Arthur Garfunkel as Sandy
* Ann-Margret as Bobbie
* Rita Moreno as Louise
* Cynthia O&#x27;Neal as Cindy
* Carol Kane as Jennifer

==Production==
The script was originally written as a play. Jules Feiffer sent it to Mike Nichols, who thought it would work better as a film. The script contains numerous curse words, some of which were rarely heard on the screen before this time. Feiffer&#x27;s play would eventually be staged for the first time in 1988 in Pasadena, California, and Dallas, Texas.

The $5 million budget was provided by Joseph E. Levine of which $1 million went to Nichols. The movie was shot in New York City and at Panorama Film Studios in Vancouver. It marked a major comeback for Ann-Margret.

==Censorship==
The changes in the morals of American society in the 1960s and 1970s, and the general receptiveness by the public to frank discussion of sexual issues, were sometimes at odds with local community standards. A theatre in Albany, Georgia, showed the film; on January 13, 1972, the local police served a search warrant on the theatre, and seized the film under local obscenity laws. In March 1972, the theatre manager, Mr. Jenkins, was convicted of the crime of &quot;distributing obscene material&quot;. The Directors Guild of America and the Motion Picture Association of America appealed this ruling. His conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Georgia. On June 24, 1974, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the State of Georgia had gone too far in classifying material as obscene in view of its prior decision in &quot;Miller v. California&quot;, (the &quot;Miller&quot; standard), and overturned the conviction in &quot;Jenkins v. Georgia&quot;, . The court also said that, 

Avco Embassy re-released the film to theaters after the Supreme Court ruling, using the tagline &quot;The United States Supreme Court has ruled that &#x27;Carnal Knowledge&#x27; is See it now!&quot;

After the film&#x27;s release in Rome, it was briefly banned in Italy in February 1972 for obscenity.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four stars out of four and called it &quot;clearly Mike Nichols&#x27; best film. It sets out to tell us certain things about these few characters and their sexual crucifixions, and it succeeds. It doesn&#x27;t go for cheap or facile laughs, or inappropriate symbolism, or a phony kind of contemporary feeling ... Nicholson, who is possibly the most interesting new movie actor since James Dean, carries the film, and his scenes with Ann-Margret are masterfully played.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was also positive, calling it &quot;a nearly ideal collaboration of directorial and writing talents&quot; that was &quot;not only very funny, but in a casual way—in the way of something observed in a half-light—more profound than much more ambitious films.&quot; Writing in &quot;Film Quarterly&quot;, Ernest Callenbach called it &quot;a solid and interesting achievement—as was [Nichols&#x27;] &quot;Virginia Woolf&quot;. It is a cold and merciless film, but then artists are not required to stand in for the Red Cross. They document disasters, and it is we the viewers who must clean them up, in our own lives.&quot; Gavin Millar of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Though not the last word on the subject, it&#x27;s still a telling and unhysterical assault on male chauvinism; and if that&#x27;s fashionable, it&#x27;s not unwelcome.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was less enthused, calling the film &quot;the iciest, most merciless and most repellent major (and seriously intended) motion picture in a very long time.&quot; Champlin thought that Nicholson had &quot;some powerful moments&quot; but his character &quot;is never comprehensible as anything but a clinical study, although the study offers no clues to how he got that way.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a rather superficial and limited probe of American male sexual hypocrisies.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t mind having a nickel for every moviegoer who walks out of &#x27;Carnal Knowledge&#x27; feeling cheated and despondent. The basic problem with the film is that it&#x27;s the artistic equivalent of the sort of thing it purports to be satirizing and abhorring: it&#x27;s a cold, calculating, unfeeling view of cold, calculating, unfeeling relationships.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and called it &quot;basically a one-note story ... The characters do not change or learn; they do not even repeat their mistakes in very interesting ways.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;This movie says not merely that there are some people like these, but that this is &quot;it&quot;—that is, that this movie, in its own satirical terms, presents a more accurate view of men and women than conventional movies do. That may be the case, but the movie isn&#x27;t convincing.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gives the film a score of 88% based on reviews from 32 critics, with an average rating of 7.70/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Although it comes lopsidedly from the male gaze, &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; is a sexually frank and ferociously well-acted battle between the sexes.&quot;

&quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; was released on DVD in Region 1 on December 7, 1999, by MGM Home Video.

<text>Ælfwine (c. 661 – 679) was the King of Deira from 670 to 679. He was a son of Oswiu of Northumbria and a brother of Ecgfrith of Northumbria.

After the succession of Ecgfrith as king of Northumbria in 670, he made Ælfwine king of the sub-kingdom of Deira. Ælfwine was still a boy at the time, and the title may have been intended to designate him as the heir of the childless Ecgfrith. He was, however, killed in battle against the Mercians at the Battle of the Trent in 679. Although his death could have led to an escalation of the war, further conflict was averted by the intervention of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, and King Æthelred of Mercia paid a &quot;weregild&quot; to Ecgfrith in compensation for Ælfwine&#x27;s death.

Bede writes: “In the ninth year of the reign of King Ecgfrith (in 679), a great battle was fought between him and Æthelred, king of the Mercians, near the river Trent, and Ælfwine, brother to King Ecgfrith, was slain, a youth about eighteen years of age, and much beloved by both provinces; for King Æthelred had married his sister Osthryth. There was now reason to expect a more bloody war, and more lasting enmity between those kings and their fierce nations; but Theodore, the bishop, beloved of God, relying on the Divine aid, by his wholesome admonitions wholly extinguished the dangerous fire that was breaking out; so that the kings and their people on both sides were appeased, and no man was put to death, but only the due mulct paid to the king who was the avenger for the death of his brother; and this peace continued long after between those kings and between their kingdoms.”

<text>The Trailways Transportation System is a public transport bus service in the United States. It operates a network of approximately 70 independent bus companies. The company is headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia.

== History ==
The predecessor to Trailways Transportation System was founded February 5, 1936, by Burlington Transportation Company, Santa Fe Trails Transportation Company, Missouri Pacific Stages, Safeway Lines, Inc., and Frank Martz Coach Company.

The system originated with coast-to-coast service as the National Trailways Bus System (NTBS). Greyhound Lines had grown so quickly in the 1920s and 1930s that the Interstate Commerce Commission encouraged smaller independent operators to form the NTBS to provide competition. Unlike Greyhound, which centralized ownership, Trailways member companies became a formidable competitor while staying an association of almost 100 separate companies. In the 1950s, Morgan W. Walker, Sr., of Alexandria, Louisiana, became head of the southern division of the company. He had entered the business on a small scale during World War II as the Interurban Transportation Company of Alexandria. During the 1950s and 1960s, consolidation among bus operators resulted in four of the five original Trailways members becoming part of a new company, Continental Trailways, which eventually operated the majority of Trailways routes.

In 1968, under the leadership of major stockholder Kemmons Wilson, Holiday Inn acquired Continental Trailways, which remained a subsidiary of Holiday Inn until 1979, when Holiday Inn sold Trailways to private investor Henry Lea Hillman Sr., of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the years during which Trailways was a subsidiary of Holiday Inn, television commercials for Holiday Inn frequently showed a Trailways bus stopping at a Holiday Inn hotel.

Regular route bus ridership in the United States had been declining steadily since World War II despite minor gains during the 1973 and 1979 energy crises. By 1986, the Greyhound Bus Line had been spun off from the parent company to new owners, which resulted in Greyhound Lines becoming solely a bus transportation company. It was sold off to new owners headed by Fred Currey, a former executive with the largest member of the National Trailways Bus System. The old Greyhound parent had changed its name to Dial Corporation.

Under the new ownership in 1987, led by Currey, Greyhound Lines later acquired the former Continental Trailways company, the largest member of the Trailways system, effectively eliminating a large portion of bus competition. Although Greyhound negotiated cooperative schedules with Carolina Coach Company and Southeastern Trailways, two of the larger members of the Trailways system, many smaller carriers were effectively forced out of business. Greyhound later acquired Carolina and the intercity operations of Southeastern. Most of the survivors diversified into charters and tours.

== Current members ==


Today Trailways members are spread across North America. They provide charter bus service, bus tours and scheduled route services, with some members providing regular route service to areas not served by any other bus company on an interlining basis with Greyhound Lines, each other, and independent companies. Members also offer motorcoach charters and tours in competitive markets.

<doc id="549990" wikidata="Q102172" url="?curid=549990" title="Limburgish">
<text>Limburgish ( or ; ; also Limburgian, Limburgic or Limburgan) refers to a group of South Low Franconian varieties spoken in Belgium and the Netherlands, characterized by their distance to, and limited participation in the formation of, Standard Dutch. In the Dutch province of Limburg, all dialects, despite their differences, have been given collectively a regional language status, including those comprising &quot;Limburgish&quot; as used in this article.

Limburgish shares many vocabulary and grammatical characteristics with both German and Dutch. A characteristic feature of many dialects of Limburgish is the occurrence of a lexical pitch accent (Franconian tone accent), which is shared with the adjacent Central Franconian dialects of German.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Limburgish&quot; (and variants of it) derives only indirectly from the now Belgian town of Limbourg (&quot;Laeboer&quot; in Limburgish, IPA: /ˈlæːbuʁ/), which was the capital of the Duchy of Limburg during the Middle Ages. More directly it is derived from the more modern name of the Province of Limburg (1815–39) in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which has been split today into a Belgian Limburg and a Dutch Limburg. In the area around the old Duchy of Limburg the main language today is French, but there is also a particular cluster of Limburgish (or Limburgish-like, depending on definitions) dialects. The use of &quot;Limburgish&quot; is first attested at the close of the 19th century.

People from Limburg usually call their language &quot;plat&quot;, similar as Low German speakers do. This &quot;plat&quot; refers simply to the fact that the language is spoken in the low plains country, as opposed to the use of &quot;High&quot; in &quot;High German&quot;, which are derived from dialects spoken in the more mountainous southerly regions. The word &quot;plat&quot; is therefore associated both with the &quot;platteland&quot; (Dutch: &quot;countryside&quot;) and can in effect sometimes mean simply &quot;slang&quot; in the sense of any very informal, rustic or locally unique words or expressions.

== Terminology ==
The term &quot;Limburgish&quot; can refer to all varieties spoken within either the Belgian or Dutch province of Limburg, the South-East of Flemish Brabant, the North-East of Liège as well as in combination with the adjacent Rhineland region in a Limburgian-Ripuarian context.

* In everyday speech, &quot;Limburgish&quot; refers to the varieties spoken in Dutch and Belgian Limburg. It is likewise legally defined through the Dutch recognition of Limburgish as a regional language under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.
* In traditional Dutch and Belgian dialectology, &quot;Limburgish&quot; is roughly defined as comprising the dialects between the Uerdingen line and the Benrath line spoken in Belgium and the Netherlands.
* Flemish linguist Jan Goossens suggested to expand the definition of &quot;Limburgish&quot; to include all Low Franconian varieties positioned between the Uerdingen and Benrath line, although this usage has not been adopted by other scholars.

Regardless of the exact definition used, the term &quot;Limburgish&quot; itself is specific to the Netherlands and Belgium, where it used by linguists and speakers alike and is strongly connected to the cultural and regional identity of the inhabitants of both Belgian and Dutch Limburg. This regional identity is notably absent from the speakers of closely related Low Franconian dialects in adjacent parts of Germany, who do not refer to their local dialects as &quot;Limburgish&quot;. In German linguistic discourse too, the term is uncommon with German linguists instead tending to use &quot;Southern Low Franconian&quot; (German: ) to refer to the same dialect grouping.

==Classification and history ==
The classification of Limburgish is contended by different national traditions. Within the context of historical linguistics, Limburgish is regarded as one of the five main dialects of Middle Dutch, although this is not considered to be a homogeneous language, but a retrofit definition based on the region where Dutch is currently an official language.

German and French dialectology considers Limburgish part of the Rhenish Fan. Sometimes it is also called a variety of Meuse-Rhenish, especially among German dialectologists. Belgian/Dutch linguistics considers it in the context of Limburgian-Ripuarian, together with the Ripuarian varieties. The early medieval Limburgish writer Heinrich von Veldeke is claimed by the tradition of both Dutch and German dialectology.

From the end of the 20th century on, Limburgish has developed a sense of autonomy from the traditional Dutch-German dipole as Limburgish linguists and functionaries consider it explicitly distinct from Dutch and German, as affirmed by the Covenant of the Limburgish language which politically decouples Limburgish from Dutch in the eyes of the Dutch government.

Limburgish developed from Old East Low Franconian, which had evolved itself from earlier Weser–Rhine Germanic, a language which had been spoken in the Low Countries on both sides of the Roman limes since at least the 4th century. During the High Middle Ages, the dialects which would result in Limburgish were influenced by the High German dialects spoken around the city of Cologne, resulting in certain High German features being absorbed by these varieties. It is the adoption of these phonological traits that resulted in Limburgish being classified as East Low Franconian.

In the past, all Limburgish varieties were therefore sometimes seen as West Central German, part of High German. This difference is caused by a difference in definition: the latter stance defines a High German variety as one that has taken part in any of the first three phases of the High German consonant shift. It is nevertheless most common in linguistics to consider Limburgish as Low Franconian.

The traditional terminology can be confusing as the differences between the historical groupings Old West Franconian and Old East Franconian (which mainly concern certain vowel variations and the presence of Ingvaeonic features) is different from the modern modern dialectal dichotomy between Western and Eastern Low Franconian, which is based on the presence or absence of High German features in Low Franconian, which did not occur until the advent of the Middle Dutch period. 
The period of High German influence lasted until the 13th century, after which the Duchy of Brabant extended its power, which resulted in a marked Brabantian influence, first among the western (i.e. spoken up to Genk) Limburgish dialects and then also among the eastern variants.

Currently Limburgish – although being essentially a variety of Low Franconian – still has a considerable distance from Standard Dutch with regards to phonology, morphology and lexicon. Standard Dutch, which developed mostly from West Low Franconian dialects such as Flemish and Brabantic, serves as the standard language (or Dachsprache) for the Limburgish varieties spoken in the Netherlands and Belgium. The speakers of Limburgish or South Low Franconian dialects in Germany use Standard German as their Dachsprache.

==Form==
Limburgish is far from being homogeneous. In other words, it has numerous varieties instead of one single standard form. Between 1995 and 1999, a uniform standard form called AGL (&quot;Algemein Gesjreve Limburgs&quot;, &quot;Generally written Limburgish&quot;) was developed and proposed, but found too little support. Today the so-called &quot;Veldeke-spelling&quot; which was first applied in the 1940s is most of the time used to write in a specific Limburgish dialect. In 2000 the parliament of the province of Dutch Limburg enacted a measure establishing the Limburgish Language Council (Raod veur &#x27;t Limburgs), a committee which advises the Parliament of Dutch Limburg on measures in relation to Limburgish. In 2003 the Limburgish Language Council adopted a standard orthography for Limburgish. On the basis of this standard orthography the Limburgish Academy Foundation (&quot;Stiechting Limbörgse Academie&quot;) is creating Limburgish-Dutch, Limburgish-English, Dutch-Limburgish and English-Limburgish dictionaries.

==Contemporary usage==

Limburgish is spoken by approximately 1.6 million people in the Low Countries and by many hundreds of thousands in Germany. It is especially in the Dutch province of Limburg that Limburgish is used not only in everyday speech, but also often in more formal situations and on the local and regional radio. According to a study by Geert Driessen, in 2011 Limburgish was spoken by 54 percent of the adults and 31 percent of the children. Limburgish has no real written tradition, except for its early beginnings. Hendrik van Veldeke wrote in a Middle Limburgish dialect. Especially in the Netherlands, the cultural meaning of the language is also important. Many song texts are written in a Limburgish dialect, for example during Carnival. Jack Poels writes most of his texts for Rowwen Hèze in Sevenums, a local dialect.

To what degree Limburgish actually is spoken in Germany today remains a matter of debate. Not depending on the city in these parts of Germany, less than 50% of the population speak a local or regional form of Limburgish. Depending on the city in these parts of Belgium, according to A, Schuck (2001) 50% to 90% of the population speak a local or regional form of Limburgish, which seems to be a clear overestimation. Moreover, research into some specific variants seems to indicate a gradual process of development towards the national standardised Dutch, especially amongst younger generations. In Belgium, the Limburgish dialects are generally considered to be more endangered than in the Netherlands.

Since Limburgish is still the mother tongue of many inhabitants in Dutch and Belgian Limburg, Limburgish grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation can have a significant impact on the way locals speak Dutch in public life. Within the modern communities of these provinces, intermediate idiolects are also very common, which combine standard Dutch with the accent and some grammatical and pronunciation tendencies derived from Limburgish. This &quot;Limburgish Dutch&quot; is confusingly also often referred to simply as &quot;Limburgish&quot;, although in Belgium such intermediate languages tend to be called (&quot;in-between language&quot;), no matter the exact dialect/language with which standard Dutch is combined.

==Linguistic versus societal status==
In March 1997 the Dutch government recognised Limburgish as a regional language (Dutch: &quot;streektaal&quot;) in the Netherlands. As such, it receives moderate protection under chapter 2 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

However, some linguists have argued that this recognition was highly politically motivated and done more on sociolinguistic than purely linguistic grounds. In 1999, the Dutch Language Union, the &quot;de facto&quot; language authority which asserted that it had not been asked for advice, opposed the recognition. From the Limburgish side it has been argued that the arguments put forth against the recognition of Limburgish were not based on linguistic considerations, but rather a concern for maintaining the dominance of the Dutch language.

On the other hand, Limburgish is not recognised by the German and Belgian national governments as an official language. An attempt at recognition, made after Limburgish had been recognised in the Netherlands, failed in the Belgian parliament due to Flemish opposition. Because in Belgium political power is divided according to linguistic lines, recognizing Limburgish as an official language would have had considerable constitutional implications and undermine the small majority Flemish speakers hold over Walloon speakers in the Belgian State.

===Expanded===

The Limburgish group belongs to the Continental West Germanic dialect continuum. As usual inside dialect continua, neighboring languages have a maximum of similarities, and speakers being used to the rather small individual lingual differences in their immediate neighborhood perceive them as close, and familiar, while more distant ones become gradually harder to understand with distance. That ends, in the Dutch–German continuum at least, most often with incomprehensible dialects. Isoglosses are so dense in this area that practically every village or town has its own distinct dialect of Limburgish. Large cities such as Mönchengladbach, Krefeld, and Düsseldorf have several local dialect varieties. The named cities have in common, that they are large enough to in part extend outside the area of the dialect group. Thus each has one or more quarters outside, having vernacular languages belonging to adjacent groups, such as Kleverlandish or Ripuarian.

A few sample dialects are: of near , of in , of central , of , of , of in Krefeld, of central , of in , of northern and central , of , of , of , of , of , and many more.

The group combines Low Franconian properties with some Ripuarian properties, such as tonal accents, the pronoun &quot;I&quot; translates as &#x27; or &#x27;, the word &quot;but&quot; most often as &#x27;, all like Ripuarian. Contrasting, &quot;time&quot; is translated as &#x27;, &quot;to have&quot; mostly as &#x27;, &quot;today&quot; as &#x27;, all typical for Low Franconian.

&#x27; (also called &#x27;) is the Dutch term for a group of dialects spoken north of the Uerdingen line, i.e. from just south of Venlo upward to the North in the Dutch province of Limburg. These dialects share many features with both the and Brabantian dialects and are closer to Standard Dutch than the more southern language varieties (see e.g. Hoppenbrouwers 2001). The term is used by Jo Daan for the entire province north of the Uerdingen line, whereas other linguists use it only for the part that has tonality, the language north of this region then being considered Kleverlandish.

The north border of the Limburgish tonality zone lies a little north of Arcen and Horst aan de Maas and just above the &quot;meej/mich&quot; isogloss, also known as the &quot;mich-kwartier&quot;. This makes this Limburgish isogloss the northernmost of all. Venlo lies between the &quot;meej/mich&quot; isogloss and the Uerdingen line, so the Venlo dialect is the only one with both forms &quot;ik&quot; and &quot;mich/dich&quot;. All dialects in the Dutch province of Limburg spoken north of the tonality border are Kleverlandish in linguistic respect.

The dialects spoken in the most southeastern part of the Dutch province of North Brabant (i.e. in and around Budel and Maarheeze) also have many Limburgish characteristics. An important difference between these dialects and the adjacent ones in the Dutch province of Limburg is, however, that the second-person pronoun &quot;gij&quot; is here used instead of &quot;doe&quot;, as in &quot;purely&quot; Brabantian dialects.

&quot;Centraal-Limburgs&quot; (&quot;Central Limburgish&quot;) includes the area around Maastricht, Sittard, Roermond, the eastern half of Belgian Limburg, and the Belgian Voeren area, and stretches further Northeast.
Belgian linguists use a more refined classification.
Dutch linguists use the term &quot;Oost-Limburgs&quot; (&quot;East Limburgish&quot;) for the form of Limburgish spoken in an area from Belgian Voeren south of Maastricht in the Netherlands to the German border. For them, &quot;West-Limburgs&quot; (&quot;West Limburgish&quot;) is the variety of Limburgish spoken in Belgium in the area east of the Uerdingen line, for example in and around Hasselt and Tongeren. It includes areas in Dutch Limburg (like Ool, Maria Hoop and Montfort) and Dutch Brabant. The border of &quot;West-Limburgs&quot; and &quot;Oost-Limburgs&quot; starts a little south of the area between the villages of &#x27;s-Gravenvoeren and Sint-Martens-Voeren in the Belgian municipality of Voeren.

==== Meuse-Rhenish ====

Limburgish is spoken in a considerable part of the German Lower Rhine area. This area extends from the border regions of Cleves, Viersen and Heinsberg, stretching out to the Rhine river. Modern linguists, both in the Netherlands and in Germany, now often combine these distinct varieties with the Cleves dialects (). This superordinating group of Low Franconian varieties (between the rivers Meuse and Rhine) is called Meuse-Rhenish ().

Both Limburgish and Low Rhenish belong to this greater Meuse-Rhine area, building a large group of Low Franconian dialects, including areas in Belgium, the Netherlands and the German Northern Rhineland. The northwestern part of this triangle came under the influence of the Dutch standard language, especially since the founding of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1815. At the same time, the southeastern portion became part of the Kingdom of Prussia, and was subject to High German language domination. At the dialectal level however, mutual understanding is still possible far beyond both sides of the national borders.

The Meuse-Rhenish dialects can be divided into Northern and Southern varieties. Hence, Limburgish is Southern Meuse-Rhenish as spoken in Belgium, the Netherlands and the German Lower Rhine. The Northern Meuse-Rhenish dialects as spoken in the Netherlands and in Germany (a little eastward along the Rhine) are unambiguously Low Franconian. As discussed above, Limburgish straddles the borderline between &quot;Low Franconian&quot; and &quot;Middle Franconian&quot; varieties. These Southern Meuse-Rhenish dialects are more-or-less mutually intelligible with the Ripuarian dialects, but have not been influenced by the High German consonant shift except in isolated words (R. Hahn 2001).

==== South Low Franconian ====
South Low Franconian (&#x27;, &#x27;) is the term used by dialectologists in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands to describe the dialect group that encompasses the Limburgish varieties of Belgian and Dutch Limburg, and also the closely related dialects in adjacent areas in Belgium (e.g. Eupen in Liège Province) and Germany (stretching from the Dutch border to the Bergisches Land Region near Düsseldorf east of the Rhine).

Goossens (1965) distinguished the following subdialects:
* (&quot;East Limburgish - Ripuarian transitional area&quot;; Uerdingen, Düsseldorf, Solingen, Remscheid, Mönchengladbach, Eupen)
* (&quot;East Limburgish&quot;; Panningen, Krefeld, Dülken, Sittard)
* (&quot;Central Limburgish&quot;; Maastricht, Vroenhoven)
* (&quot;West Limburgish - Central Limburgish transitional area&quot;; around and southern of Genk)
** (Tongeren)
** (Genk, Bilzen)
* (&quot;West Limburgish&quot;; Veldeke, Hasselt, St.-Truiden, Loon)
* (&quot;South Brabantian - West Limburgish transitional area&quot;)
** (Beringen)
** (Tienen)

==Orthography==

There is no standardized form of Limburgish, nor is there an official standard spelling for the individual Limburgish dialects. The dialect association Veldeke Limburg developed an advisory spelling in 2003 that is endorsed by the Limburgish Language Council and aims at uniformly representing all the sounds that occur within the Limburgish dialects in writing. Although this spelling also does not have official status, it is used within this dialect association as well as for the spelling of bilingual place name signs.

==Phonology==
The sound inventory below is based on the variety of West-Limburgs spoken in Montfort.

===Consonants===
* may not show up in the Hasselt dialect, but is common in other Limburgish dialects, e.g. &quot;zègke&quot; (Dutch: &quot;zeggen&quot;) &quot;to say&quot;.
* Other Limburgish dialects also have the following sounds: (landj); (tenj, teeth).
* is realized as in Belgian Limburgish.
* is a common allophone of , especially in coda position. It is rare in the Montfortian dialect.
* and are allophones of and , occurring in a front-vowel environment. This is termed &quot;Soft G&quot; in Dutch dialectology.
* is an allophone of . In some dialects, it may be the usual realization of .
* In most modern dialects, is uvular.

Overall, Limburgish dialects tend to have more consonants than Dutch. They also tend to have more vowels. According to Peter Ladefoged, the vowel inventory of the dialect of Weert is perhaps the richest in the world. It has 28 vowels, among which there are 12 long monophthongs (three of which surface as centering diphthongs), 10 short monophthongs and 6 diphthongs.

In most of the Limburgish dialects spoken to the southeast of Panningen—for example those of Roermond, Sittard and Heerlen— appears at the beginning of words in the consonant clusters &quot;sp&quot;, &quot;st&quot;, &quot;sl&quot;, &quot;sm&quot;, &quot;sn&quot; and &quot;zw&quot;. The same sound is realized as elsewhere (e.g. &quot;sjtraot&quot;/&quot;straot&quot;, &quot;street&quot;). This is not the case, however, in the dialects of for example Venlo, Weert, Maastricht, Echt, Montfort and Posterholt.

===Vowels===

====Monophthongs====

* only occurs in unstressed syllables.
* are realised as before alveolar consonants.

=== Diphthongs ===
The diphthongs occur, as well as combinations of + . only occurs in French loanwords and interjections.

 is realized as before alveolar consonants. can be realized as or . In the dialect of Geleen, is realized as and as . In many dialects such as that of Maastricht and Sittard, the long vowel in Dutch cognates is most of the time realized as , as in &quot;nao&quot; (&quot;after&quot;, &quot;to, towards&quot;). The Standard Dutch equivalents are &quot;na&quot; and &quot;naar&quot; .

In about 50 Belgian Limburgish dialects, the rounded front vowels are unrounded to in most native words. They are retained in French loanwords such as &quot;dzjuus&quot; .

===Tone===


The pitch accent means having two different accents used in stressed syllables. The difference between these two accents is used for differentiating both various grammatical forms of a single lexeme and minimal tone pairs one from the other.

With specific regards to Limburgish, these two accents are traditionally known as &quot;sjtoettoen&quot; (&quot;push tone&quot;) and &quot;sjleiptoen&quot; (&quot;dragging tone&quot;). For example, &quot;daãg&quot; with a dragging tone means &quot;day&quot; in Limburgish, while in many Limburgish dialects &quot;daàg&quot; with a push tone is the plural form, &quot;days&quot; (in addition, can also be articulated in a neutral tone as a third possibility. In this case, it means &quot;bye-bye&quot; [&quot;good day&quot;]). In the preceding example, the difference is grammatical, but not lexical. An example of a lexical difference caused only by tone is the word &quot;biè&quot; which is articulated with a push tone and means &quot;bee&quot;, which forms a tonal minimal pair with &quot;biẽ&quot;, which is articulated with a dragging tone and means &quot;at&quot;. This contrastive pitch accent also occurs in Central Franconian dialects spoken to the southeast of Limburgish.

Other Indo-European pitch accent languages that use tone contours to distinguish the meaning of words that are otherwise phonetically identical include Lithuanian, Latvian, Swedish, Norwegian, Standard Slovene (only some speakers), and Serbo-Croatian. This feature is comparable to tone systems as found e.g. in Chinese or many languages of Africa and Central America, although such &quot;classical&quot; tone languages make much more use of tone distinctions when compared to Limburgish.

Historically, pitch accent in Limburgish and Central Franconian developed independently from accent systems in other Indo-European languages. While contrastive accent can be reconstructed for Proto Indo-European, it was completely lost in Proto-Germanic. Its reemergence in Limburgish (and Central Franconian) was phonetically triggered by vowel height, vowel length, and voicing of a following consonant, and became phonemic with sound changes that must have occurred after 1100 CE such as lengthening of short vowels in open syllables, loss of schwa in final syllables, devoicing of consonants in final position, and merger of vowels that had been distinct before.

====Particular local features====
=====Bitonality=====
It has been proven by speech analysis that in the Belgian Limburgish dialect of Borgloon, the dragging tone itself is bitonal, while it has also been proved that this is not the case in the adjacent Limburgish dialects of Tongeren and Hasselt.

=====Steeper fall=====
Other research has indicated that the push tone has a steeper fall in the eastern dialects of Limburgish (e.g. those of Venlo, Roermond and Maasbracht) than it has in western dialects. In addition, both the phonetic realisation and the syllable-based distribution of the contrasts between push and dragging tone seem to be mora-bound in the eastern dialects only. This has been examined especially by Jörg Peters.

=====Diphthongization=====
Moreover, in some dialects such as that of Sittard and Maastricht, especially the mid and high vowels tend to diphthongize when they have a push tone. So in the dialect of Sittard means &quot;to choose&quot; while in the dialect of Maasbracht no diphthongization takes place, so means the same here. This difference has been examined in particular by Ben Hermans and Marc van Oostendorp.

Other examples include plural
* &quot;steĩn&quot; &quot;stone&quot;
* &quot;steìn&quot; &quot;stones&quot;
and lexical
* &quot;grave&quot;
* &quot;hole next to a road&quot;

Verbs distinguish mood with tone:
* &quot;We conquer!&quot;
* &quot;May we conquer!&quot;

The difference between push tone and dragging tone may also purely mark grammatical declension without there being any difference in meaning, as in the dialect of Borgloon: &quot;gieël&quot; (&quot;yellow&quot;, with dragging tone) as opposed to &quot;en gieël peer&quot; (&quot;a yellow pear&quot;, with push tone). This tonal shift also occurs when the adjective gets an inflectional ending, as in &quot;nen gieëlen appel (&quot;a yellow apple&quot;).

In some parts of Limburg, the tonal plural is being replaced with the Dutch forms among the younger generation, so that the plural for &quot;daag&quot; becomes &quot;dage&quot; ().

== Grammar ==
=== Nouns ===

==== Gender ====
Limburgish has three grammatical genders. In some of the Limburgish dialects, is used before masculine words beginning with &quot;b&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;t&quot; or with a vowel and in many other dialects is used before all masculine words. In most dialects, the indefinite article is for masculine nouns, for feminine nouns and or for neuter nouns. Without stress, these forms are most of the time realized as , and .

==== Plural ====
For some nouns, Limburgish uses simulfixes (i.e. umlaut) to form the plural:

* – (brother – brothers)
* – (shoe – shoes): note this can also be &#x27;sjoon&#x27; with (pushing tone).

For some nouns, there exists a separate conjugation as well:

* - - / - - - (my home - your home - his home / her home - our home - their home)

Plural and diminutive nouns based on Umlaut start to prevail east towards Germany. However, towards the west, the phonemic distinction between dragging and pushing tone will stop just before Riemst.

==== Diminutives ====
The diminutive suffix is most often &quot;-ke&quot;, as in Brabantian, or &quot;-je&quot;/&quot;-sje&quot; after a dental consonant. For some nouns an umlaut is also used and in &quot;breurke&quot; for &#x27;little brother&#x27; and &quot;sjeunke&quot; for &#x27;little shoe&#x27;.

=== Adjectives ===
According to their declension, Limburgish adjectives can be grouped into two classes. Adjectives of the first class get the ending &quot;-e&quot; in their masculine and feminine singular forms and always in plural, but no ending in their neuter singular form. When combined with a masculine noun in singular adjectives may also end on &quot;-en&quot;, under the same phonological conditions which apply to articles. To this class belong most adjectives ending on a , &quot;-d&quot;, &quot;-k&quot;, &quot;-p&quot;, &quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-s&quot; preceded by another consonant or with one of the suffixes , and . The other declension class includes most adjectives ending on &quot;-f&quot;, &quot;-g&quot;, &quot;-j&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;,&quot;-m&quot;,&quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-ng&quot;, &quot;-r&quot;, &quot;-w&quot; or &quot;-s&quot; preceded by a vowel; these adjectives only get the ending in their masculine singular form.

When used as a predicate, Limburgish adjectives never get an ending: (Maastrichtian: &quot;That man is crazy&quot;). Except for neuter adjectives which sometimes get -t: &quot;&#x27;t Eint of &#x27;t angert&quot;, though this is dying out.

=== Pronouns ===

==== Personal pronouns ====
==== Possessive pronouns ====
In the masculine singular forms of &quot;mien&quot;, &quot;dien&quot;, &quot;zien&quot; and &quot;oos&quot;, final &quot;-n&quot; is added under the same phonological conditions which apply to articles and adjectives. Deletion of the final &quot;-n&quot; in the neuter forms of &quot;mien&quot;, &quot;dien&quot;, &quot;zien&quot; no longer occurs in the dialect of Venlo and is also disappearing in the dialect of Roermond.

==== Demonstrative pronouns ====
The most common demonstrative pronouns in Limburgish are:

==Vocabulary==
Most of the modern Limburgish vocabulary is very similar to that of Standard Dutch or to that of Standard German due to a heavy influence from the two. However, some of the basic vocabulary is rooted in neighboring Central German dialects.

Historically, the vocabulary of the varieties of Limburgish spoken within current Belgian territory has been more influenced by French than that of the Limburgish dialects spoken on Dutch and German soil, as appears form words such as &quot;briquet&quot; (&quot;cigarette-lighter&quot;), &quot;camion&quot; (&quot;truck&quot;) and &quot;crevette&quot; (&quot;shrimp&quot;). The language has similarities with both German and Dutch, and Hendrik van Veldeke, a medieval writer from the region, is referred to as both one of the earlier writers in German and one of the earliest writers in Dutch.

<text>An experimental aircraft is an aircraft intended for testing new aerospace technologies and design concepts.

The term &quot;research aircraft&quot; or &quot;testbed aircraft&quot;, by contrast, generally denotes aircraft modified to perform scientific studies, such as weather research or geophysical surveying, similar to a research vessel.

The term &quot;experimental aircraft&quot; also has specific legal meaning in Australia, the United States and some other countries; usually used to refer to aircraft flown with an experimental certificate. In the United States, this also includes most homebuilt aircraft, many of which are based on conventional designs and hence are experimental only in name because of certain restrictions in operation.

<doc id="550003" wikidata="Q16258591" url="?curid=550003" title="Westward Television">
<text>Westward Television was the first ITV franchise-holder for the South West of England. It held the franchise from 29 April 1961 until 31 December 1981. After a difficult start, Westward Television provided a popular, distinctive and highly regarded service to its region, until heavy competition led to its franchise not being renewed by the IBA. Westward launched the career of many broadcasters who became well known nationally, won numerous awards for its programming, and heavily influenced its successor, TSW.

== History ==
The company&#x27;s first chairman was Peter Cadbury, who had left the board of Tyne Tees Television to set up the company and bid for the south-west franchise, which he won against 11 competing bids. Cadbury named the company after the golf course at Westward Ho! in north Devon, where he played. Ironically, Westward Ho! was part of the region that found reception of the television signal most difficult, until the construction of the Huntshaw Cross relay transmitter in 1968. Westward&#x27;s region was surrounded on three sides by the sea, which was strongly reflected in Westward&#x27;s output and its company logo, a silver model of the &quot;Golden Hind&quot;.

In early January 1969, plans were drawn up for a merger between Westward and the Keith Prowse company, as Peter Cadbury was chairman of both. By 17 January, the deal was done. EMI purchased Keith Prowse Music Publishing from Westward in the latter part of 1969. Soon, the Westward board was in continual disagreement, and in January 1970 Cadbury was sacked and re-hired within days as the chairman of the Westward board, after he made outspoken remarks against the levy imposed on advertising revenue imposed by the IBA while also withholding a Westward corporation tax bill to the Inland Revenue over the same matter. By July 1980, Cadbury was finally removed from the Westward board and over the following six months, he tried to regain control.

Westward began broadcasting in colour in 1971, initially from the Redruth transmitter, and a few months later colour was extended to the Stockland Hill and Caradon Hill transmitters. To mark the change, Westward&#x27;s ident was re-shot in colour.

=== Franchise loss ===
On 28 December 1980, while the ITV network was showing &quot;Drake&#x27;s Venture&quot; (Westward Television&#x27;s two-hour filmed drama to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s circumnavigation of the globe, starring John Thaw), ITN interrupted a commercial break to announce ATV was to undergo major changes and Southern and Westward had not had their licences renewed by the IBA; the south-west franchise was awarded to TSW (Television South West).

Following the loss of its franchise, Westward&#x27;s management decided to sell up quickly, and the company (including its staff, premises and programme library) was purchased by TSW, early in 1981, for £2.38 million. TSW continued using the Westward name and symbol on screen until 31 December 1981; thereafter, it was re-branded on screen as TSW.

A special programme, &quot;20 Years of Westward&quot;, was broadcast on 21 December 1981 to look back on the company&#x27;s achievements. It was presented by Roger Shaw, and recorded in front of a studio audience. Hastings Mann&#x27;s &quot;Westward Ho!&quot; was used as the theme music. Studio guests included Angela Rippon, Kenneth MacLeod and Sheila Kennedy. There were filmed contributions from Alan Freeman, Jan Leeming and David Vine and many clips of Westward programmes were shown. The special programme ended with a message from Peter Cadbury, in which he wished TSW well.

=== Closure ===
Unlike the other ITV stations that lost their franchises in this round, Westward (having been run by successor TSW since August 1981) opted to hand over at midnight on 31 December 1981. On that evening they broadcast the first 25 minutes of Scottish Television&#x27;s Hogmanay show live, and then cut away just before midnight when Roger Shaw appeared on camera in a traditional dinner jacket seated at an antique wooden desk, surrounded by staff wearing formal suits and holding film reels and 2-inch videotapes. He closed Westward Television with this announcement:

===Launch of TSW===
TSW then began with a short video clip of a champagne bottle being opened, accompanied by the short audio version of the station ident &quot;That&#x27;s Soul, Write&quot;. Shaw then re-appeared wearing a modern suit, no longer in a dinner jacket and now in a modern chair, surrounded by staff wearing TSW T-shirts and holding 2-inch videotapes. This was clearly to remind viewers of a new modern era as well as a new look. Shaw made the first announcement on TSW:

This was followed by the full version of TSW&#x27;s ident. One or both of the in-vision announcements had been pre-recorded due to the rapid change of outfits.

The comedy programme was followed by further continuity, an epilogue, weather and shipping forecast and closedown (with the national anthem) - all with TSW branding. However, when the screen finally faded to black at approximately 12:40am on 1 January 1982, Shaw made a final out-of-vision courtesy announcement and managed to mention the now-defunct &quot;Westward&quot; one last time, saying &#x27;from all the staff here at Westward - good night&#x27;.

No recordings of the end of Westward Television were known to exist until 2012 (the 30th anniversary of the end of Westward), but then a full video recording of the evening, including the segment of STV&#x27;s wiped Hogmanay show, was recovered by the classic television organisation Kaleidoscope. Parts of the recording were featured at a Kaleidoscope event and at that year&#x27;s &quot;Missing Believed Wiped&quot; at the British Film Institute.

== Studios ==
Based at purpose-built studios at Derry&#x27;s Cross in Plymouth, with a London office (sited at various locations including New Bond Street, Marble Arch and Sloane Square) and a sales office in Bristol.

The Derry&#x27;s Cross studios were designed by the architects Treadgold and Elsey, who had previously designed the TWW Studios at Pontcanna, Cardiff and Arno&#x27;s Court, Bristol (Howett 1994).

During Westward&#x27;s tenure, Derry&#x27;s Cross had three studios. Studio 1 was , Studio 2 was and used for news, sport and interview programmes and an announcers&#x27; studio was located beside Master control.

The studios were originally fitted out by Marconi, using top-of-the-range studio equipment. Westward engineer Peter Rodgers recalled: &quot;From the start, where we could afford it, we bought the best.&quot; (Howett 1994) By the time Westward began broadcasting, Derry&#x27;s Cross had cost Westward over £500,000, with the company committed to spending another £20,000 on the studios by April 1962.

In 1981 the studios, along with the company, were purchased by TSW; in 1993 the building was sold to a firm of solicitors and converted into offices. In 2010 the buildings were demolished to make way for a new retail development.

== Identity ==
Westward Television&#x27;s corporate branding focused on the sea, and mainly used a ship emblem for their on-screen look. The first ident featured an image of a boat on the water, before replacing the image with a stylised ship image in a circle, complete with Westward legend and channel nine and twelve identifiers (representing the Stockland Hill and Caradon Hill transmitters of the time), to a tune of four chimes. This was replaced in the mid-1960s by a model of the &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, shot against a black background with a simple Westward caption beneath accompanied by the &quot;Holly and the Ivy&quot; tune on brass instruments. This ident was altered slightly in the late 1960s to update the font to Compacta Bold.

When colour television came to the region on 22 May 1971, the &quot;Golden Hind&quot; was re-shot against a blue background with the caption altered to include a small stylised ship image in a box in the lower left corner, followed by an outlined &#x27;Westward TV&#x27; caption, with &#x27;TV&#x27; in red. The tune that accompanied the colour television ident was originally a nautical fanfare on brass instruments, based on the song &quot;Come Landlord Fill the Flowing Bowl&quot;, arranged by Paul Lewis. This formed part of a longer ident theme titled &quot;An English Overture&quot;, used at the start of each day&#x27;s broadcasts. The short ident theme was changed around 1978 to a seven-note fanfare. This was Westward&#x27;s final ident and remained with the company until the end of the franchise.

In addition to these idents, Westward used a clock contained in a curved box with both analogue and digital displays, alongside the Westward Television stylised ship logo and name. Westward was a frequent user of in-vision continuity, with many of the station&#x27;s personalities becoming well known in the region.

== Programming ==
Westward&#x27;s small size and the structure of ITV (which, at the time, deliberately made it hard for small and medium-sized ITV companies to contribute to the network) meant it produced comparatively little output for the network. Instead, the company concentrated on regional programming. From 1968 until the end of its franchise, the ITA (later the IBA) gave Westward a target of providing 6.5 hours of new regional programming a week - a target which they always exceeded.

Westward&#x27;s programming schedule was always published as a magazine for the public to access. Initially, they published weekly programme listings in its own programme journal, &quot;Look Westward&quot;. The first edition cost 5d, and featured a special article by Westward board member Daphne du Maurier. Many Westward personalities, such as announcer Sheila Kennedy, also contributed articles to the magazine. As part of the 1968 franchise round, the ITA created Independent Television Publications (ITP), and Westward&#x27;s weekly listings would be obliged to appear solely in the local edition of the national listings magazine &quot;TVTimes&quot;, which was published by ITP.

=== Local programming ===
Westward Television had a dual policy for its local programming: it produced a wide range of programmes of particular interest to the south-west&#x27;s rural and agricultural communities, whilst simultaneously producing programming designed to stimulate its audience&#x27;s interest in new areas.

One of the best known programmes was &quot;Treasure Hunt&quot;, a game show presented by Kenneth Horne and Keith Fordyce, among others, which ran for 14 years and at one stage featured Jethro as the pirate co-host.

==== News and current affairs ====
By 1969, Westward had more than 100 correspondents across the region, reporting newsworthy local events, and eight film cameramen who would travel the region gathering footage and compiling reports. The flagship programme was &quot;Westward Diary&quot;, which began as a regional magazine programme broadcast three times a week (Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays) between 6:15 pm and 7 pm. Originally, there were three presenters – Barry Westwood, Reginald Bosanquet and Kenneth MacLeod – who rotated on a weekly basis. The regional news was contained in a separate ten-minute &quot;Westward News&quot; bulletin, broadcast every weekday at 6.05 pm, and subsequently supplemented by afternoon and late-night bulletins.

&quot;Westward Diary&quot; was soon merged with &quot;Westward News&quot;, to become what was known at the time as a &#x27;regional news magazine&#x27;, and was broadcast every weekday between 6.00 pm and 6:30 pm. Kenneth MacLeod was asked to present the new programme permanently. The news would be read by the duty announcer, so MacLeod&#x27;s role on the &quot;Diary&quot; was not as a newsreader but a presenter holding the whole package together.

The weeknightly &quot;Westward Diary&quot; had two halves, separated by a commercial break. The first half concentrated on the regional news, whereas the second half included other items of interest to local viewers. A number of experts would visit to present regular features: Ted Tuckerman would present a fishing spot called &quot;Tight Lines&quot;, Jon Miller (the zoologist, and also presenter of Southern Television&#x27;s &quot;How&quot;) would present a spot about nature, architect David Young would examine local architecture of interest, and Topline Broadhurst would present regular gardening spots. There was a regular spot called &quot;Help!&quot; for charity and voluntary groups; a slot called &quot;Pick of the Post&quot; in which viewers&#x27; letters would be read; and the popular &quot;Picture Puzzle&quot;, in which viewers had to try to guess the location shown in a photograph taken somewhere in the South West).

Westward staff returned to work a few days before the end of the ITV national strike of 1979. Kenneth MacLeod had to present &quot;Westward Diary&quot; in what looked to viewers like almost total darkness, as the union permitted only the house lights to be switched on in the studio.

In the early 1970s, &quot;A Date With Danton&quot; was a stand-alone weekly programme that provided a round-up of local arts and entertainment events. This later became a spot entitled &quot;What&#x27;s On&quot;, in Friday&#x27;s edition of &quot;Westward Diary&quot;. The Friday edition of &quot;Sports Desk&quot; was a stand-alone programme in the early &#x27;70s, but this too became part of the &quot;Diary&quot; towards the end of the decade. To accommodate this, the length of Friday&#x27;s edition of &quot;Diary&quot; was extended to an hour, and it occasionally featured a live studio audience. Westward was one of the first ITV regions to broadcast a late-evening regional news bulletin (&quot;Westward Late News&quot;).

The local weather forecast in &quot;Westward Diary&quot;, with an emphasis on specialist information for fishermen and farmers, was given by a popular local personality, Graham Danton, who presented several programmes for Westward, including &quot;Holiday Times&quot;, an events listings programme aimed at people holiday-making in the region, and &quot;Late With Danton&quot;, a consumer programme.

On April Fools&#x27; Day, 1973, Westward broadcast a film about the village of Spiggot, which had boycotted decimalisation and were still using pre-decimal currency. Many viewers wrote to Westward in support of the villagers&#x27; stance, oblivious to the date the film was broadcast.

==== Children ====
An early programme for young people was &quot;Spin Along&quot;, a regional pop music programme presented by disc-jockey Alan Freeman. The first edition was broadcast on Tuesday 12 September 1961 at 6:15pm, in place of &quot;Westward Diary&quot;. A second series began on 24 September 1962 and moved to 7pm.

Another local music programme was &quot;Move Over Dad&quot;. In November 1963 The Beatles had to be smuggled into Derry&#x27;s Cross through a tunnel to record an interview with continuity announcer Stuart Hutchison for the programme, due to the number of fans outside the studios.

Other 60s music programmes included &quot;Pop And Leslie&quot; and &quot;The Westward Beat Competition&quot; from 1964. The &quot;Westward Beat Competition&quot; had a panel of judges that included Brian Epstein and Dick Rowe and was won by The Rustiks.

In 1969, Angela Rippon joined Westward from BBC South West, as a producer of children&#x27;s and women&#x27;s programmes; she also produced a monthly show during the summer of 1972 which laid claim to being the first &quot;Open Access&quot; TV show for young people in the UK. This was called &quot;The Show Without A Title&quot;, and was the brainchild of the station&#x27;s then Programme Controller Terry Fleet. The monthly show was presented by members of an editorial team that included David Rodgers, who later went on to become a familiar Westward TV staff presenter. Angela Rippon was the programme&#x27;s Editor, with Roger Gage being its director. The show&#x27;s run (which was broadcast at 5.20pm on Fridays after being pre-recorded in Studio One on the preceding Wednesday) was short-lived. A year later, in 1973, another series aimed at young people called &quot;Young Eyes&quot; took to the Westward TV airwaves; this was co-presented by Andy Price and the actress Lesley Manville. David Rodgers was again one of the regular contributors.

Another popular long-running programme featured a puppet rabbit, Gus Honeybun, who appeared with the duty announcer who read out birthday greetings to the region&#x27;s children: The story went that Gus was found wandering Dartmoor by a Westward Outside Broadcast unit. Children could request that Gus waggle his ears, wink, stand on his head, count their age in &quot;bunny-hops&quot;, or turn off the lights. Gus&#x27;s behaviour tended to be excellent for Roger Shaw, but for Judi Spiers and Iain Stirling he could be rather unpredictable. Gus was retained by TSW when they took over the franchise.

On Sunday mornings, Westward aired &quot;Look and See&quot;, a five-minute religious slot for the under-8s broadcast from the continuity studio. Its presenters included Norah Thomas, Jill Mapson, Pat Webber and Ann Davey. As with most other ITV companies, the station also produced a nightly Epilogue under the title of &quot;Faith for Life&quot;, produced largely from the continuity studio.

In 1980, Westward produced &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Moor&quot;, a seven part networked children&#x27;s drama series about a young girl living on Dartmoor during the Second World War. It starred Tamar le Bailly as Maggie and was produced and directed by John King, the father of wildlife photographer and presenter Simon King, who featured as &quot;The Buzzard Boy&quot; in Episode 5.

==== Agriculture ====
Agriculture was an important industry in South West England during Westward Television&#x27;s franchise. Approximately 80% of land in South West England is in agricultural use (19.6% of England&#x27;s total). Westward TV had an Agricultural Advisory committee chaired by R. G. Pomeroy to advise the company on its agricultural output. For nine months of the year, Westward broadcast &quot;Farming News&quot; (later retitled &quot;Farm and Country News&quot;) on Sunday lunchtimes presented and edited by Peter Forde. Westward also produced an adult education series aimed at farmers called &quot;Acres For Profit&quot;.

== Network contributions ==
Westward&#x27;s contributions to the network were very rare at first, mainly consisting of one-off programmes and editions of the &quot;Morning Service&quot; (later renamed &quot;Morning Worship&quot;).

Initially, Westward had an arrangement with ABC Weekend Television (ABC) to provide its network programming. As Channel Television took its network feed from Stockland Hill, this obliged Channel to affiliate to ABC. These &#x27;affiliate&#x27; arrangements lasted until they were abolished in the 1964 franchise round. Westward also had an arrangement with Associated TeleVision (ATV), to play out any networked Westward programmes onto the ITV network.

On 19 January 1972, there was a relaxation on the restrictions of broadcast hours that had been set by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. This allowed regular daytime programming on weekday afternoons, and weekday morning programming during out-of-school term time. These extra off-peak hours gave smaller ITV companies a chance to provide some networked or part-networked programmes. By the mid &#x27;70s, Westward had taken advantage of this opportunity by finding a small niche producing adult education programmes for the ITV network. These included the series &quot;Westcountry Fayre&quot; (cookery), &quot;Freeze!&quot; (freezing food) and &quot;Keep Britain Slim&quot; (slimming).

=== About Britain ===

One of the new daytime weekday programmes introduced through the relaxation of broadcast hours was &quot;About Britain&quot;. This strand was made up of half-hour documentaries contributed by each of the ITV regions covering interesting aspects of their respective regions.

In 1973 the Countryside Commission opened the South West Coast Peninsula Walk from Minehead in Somerset to Swanage in Dorset via Land&#x27;s End. Westward Television asked &quot;Diary&quot; reporter Clive Gunnell to walk the new route and film his journey.

Clive was a Londoner. He had begun his television career as a props man at Associated-Rediffusion, where he first met Kenneth MacLeod. He had already walked the new Two Moors Walk from Plymouth to Lynmouth and filmed his journey for &quot;Westward Diary&quot;. This had proved popular and led to the new series &quot;Walking Westward&quot;.

Clive Gunnell set off from Weston-super-Mare rather than Minehead, and his journey took many series to complete. It took five series before he reached the south coast. Westward used a selection of Clive&#x27;s films as part of their contribution to &quot;About Britain&quot;, and due to its network exposure &quot;Walking Westward&quot; remains one of Westward Television&#x27;s best remembered programmes. Fifteen-minute sections of Clive Gunnell&#x27;s walk along the Cornish coast were broadcast by the US Public Broadcasting Service as curtain raisers to the BBC&#x27;s original version of &quot;Poldark&quot; in PBS&#x27;s &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; series.

Clive Gunnell also made documentaries about inland areas that were also contributed to &quot;About Britain&quot;. In 1977 his documentary &quot;To Tavistock Goosie Fair&quot; won &quot;Most Outstanding Regional Production of 1977&quot;. In 1980 he began work on a series of six films on Dartmoor called &quot;Dartmoor&quot;. Some of these films were featured in the &quot;About Britain&quot; strand in 1981.

=== Doing Things ===

Like &quot;About Britain&quot;, &quot;Doing Things&quot; was a series of half-hour filmed documentaries contributed by the various ITV regions and broadcast in the early afternoon. It was broadcast in 1973–74 and looked at hobbies. Westward Television contributed &quot;Beachcombing&quot;, a film presented and directed by Clive Gunnell, to this series.

<text>Belomorkanal () is a Russian brand of &quot;papirosa&quot; (cigarettes), originally made by the in Leningrad, Soviet Union.

==History==

Belomorkanal was created in 1932 to commemorate the construction of the White Sea–Baltic Canal, also known as the Belomorkanal. , a process engineer, developed the tobacco blend, and Andrey Tarakanov drew the pack design.

Belomorkanal cigarettes are still produced in various post-Soviet republics, most notably in Russia, in Kamianets-Podilskyi (Ukraine), and in Hrodna (Belarus).

Belomorkanal is also used by cannabis users, wherein &quot;emptied cigarettes are then filled with a mixture of tobacco and marijuana for smoking&quot;, with the cardboard tube serving as a built-in roach.

==Markets==
Belomorkanal cigarettes were widely available in the Soviet Union. They are still sold in some post-Soviet states, including Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

==In popular culture==
In a 1985 song by Jan Krzysztof Kelus, the name of the cigarettes is compared to &quot;Auschwitz Filters&quot; due to the fact that many thousands of Gulag prisoners had died during the construction of the canal.

Nicolas Rothwell&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;Belomor&quot; takes its name from this cigarette.

<text>The SNCASE S.E.2010 Armagnac was a large French airliner of the late 1940s built by SNCASE (Sud-Est). The aircraft&#x27;s disappointing performance and range prevented it from achieving commercial success. Although the SNCASE Armagnac did not have a sterling career, its passenger compartment design gave it a much roomier feel and greater capacity and foreshadowed the future wide-body jet airliners.

==Design and development==
Designed originally around a French requirement for an 87-passenger, long range airliner issued in 1942, the S.E. 2000 was to have been powered by four 2,100 hp Gnome-Rhône 18R engines. At an early stage, the S.E. 2000 was abandoned in favour of a larger, more capable version, the S.E. 2010 Armagnac. 
The Armagnac was a cantilever mid-wing monoplane with retractable tricycle landing gear designed for transatlantic service. A number of versions were planned from a 60-passenger &quot;sleeping berth&quot; version to 84-passenger, 108-passenger and 160-passenger versions.
After delays to the planning because of wartime conditions, work proceeded quickly at Toulouse, Marseilles and Paris, where various components were being built and tested. The Armagnac was designed from the outset in a Cook-Craigie production line prior to the first prototype which flew on 2 April 1949 with Sud-Est Chief Pilot Pierre Nadot at the controls but was lost on 30 January 1950 while still undergoing tests. The first production series aircraft F-BAVD flew on 30 December 1950. Examples of the S.E.2010 were demonstrated at the 1951 and 1953 Paris &quot;Grand Palais&quot;.

Although the S.E.2010 was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360-B13 Wasp Major engines, the most powerful piston engine ever placed into production for aircraft use, a concern that the final design was underpowered led to a planned redesign. The final (15th) production aircraft was intended to be re-engined with 5,400 hp Allison T40 turboprops, but production was curtailed at eight and the more advanced version was never built. An Armagnac, S.O. 2060, ended its days as an engine test-bed, alternately fitted with turbojet engines fitted in a nacelle below the fuselage. It was tested with two Snecma Atar 101 turbojets each engine having a different system of afterburner. The Snecma Vulcain was also tested in a similar manner.

==Operational history==

At the time, the Armagnac was one of the largest civil aircraft ever built with a wingspan of almost 50 meters and weight over 77 tonnes. The capacious pressurized cabin (with a near-circular fuselage section with 4.7 m/ 15 ft width and height) was intended for a three tier sleeping compartment configuration which ultimately was not fitted to any of the S.E.2010 versions. The fuselage was left with a good deal of unusable space with only open luggage shelves mounted in the upper fuselage.

Initial production of 15 aircraft was planned for delivery to launch customer Air France. After evaluation of the prototype by Air France, the airline declined delivery in 1952 when the first production aircraft was ready, citing inadequate performance. Despite being designed for transatlantic service, the aircraft&#x27;s range of 5,000 km, fell short of the 6,500 km required range for this use. Additionally, the aircraft was too large to be operated profitably for shorter range routes.

Including the sole prototype, only nine aircraft were built with TAI (&quot;Transports Aériens Intercontinentaux&quot;) (later UTA) evaluating the first production aircraft in April 1952. A total of four S.E.2010s were delivered to TAI in December 1952, who used them for eight months and then discarded them as unprofitable. The aircraft passed to SAGETA (the &quot;Société Auxiliaire de Gérance et d&#x27;Exploitation de Transport Aériens&quot;) in 1953 who operated seven Armagnacs to ferry cargo, mail and troops from Toulouse to Saigon in French Indochina. They were highly regarded in this role, but French rule in the area was almost over and they were surplus by mid-1954.

Most Armagnacs were broken up in 1955 although two were used to transport the French contingent to the 1956 Olympic Games held in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Jack Russell, a retired Australian Air Traffic Controller fondly recalled the Armagnac which was the most distinctive of the various aircraft types to visit Australia for the Games. His description: &quot;...an 80-ton aircraft which resembled two shipping containers welded together lengthways with a wing and two under-powered engines protruding on each side. The aircraft&#x27;s performance matched its appearance.&quot; Visiting aircraft were ferried to Mangalore Airport. While passing above a Mangalore-bound Armagnac, a Trans Australia Airlines pilot when asked to report the S.E. 2010&#x27;s position, exclaimed &quot;If it&#x27;s that block of flats below us, we&#x27;re passing it now!&quot; F-BAVI, one of the Melbourne caravan was the last SNCASE Armagnac survivor, and was scrapped in 1975 at Bordeaux/Merignac after having lain derelict for many years.

==Incidents and accidents==
On 30 June 1950, F-WAVA, the prototype was lost after it crashed and caught fire on takeoff after a wing leading edge panel separated. Two fatalities on board and one on the ground resulted. SAGETA F-BAVG flying out of Tunis on 29 January 1957, crashed at Paris-Orly in inclement weather, resulting in two fatalities. While flying from Algeria, on 19 December 1957, F-BAVH flying for SAGETA, was crippled midair when a bomb detonated in the lavatory, causing a large hole in the fuselage. Despite the severe damage, a safe emergency landing was carried out at Lyon, 90 minutes later.

<text>The Church House is the home of the headquarters of the Church of England, occupying the south end of Dean&#x27;s Yard next to Westminster Abbey in London. Besides providing administrative offices for the Church Commissioners, the Archbishops&#x27; Council and the Church of England Pensions Board, and a chamber for the General Synod, the building also provided a meeting place for the Parliament of the United Kingdom during World War II, and for some of the organs of the newly formed United Nations afterwards, including the first meeting of the UN Security Council. It has more recently been the venue for several notable public inquiries.

==Origins==
The idea of a central meeting and administrative building for the Church of England had been raised twice in the mid 19th century and was finally acted upon in 1886 when Harvey Goodwin, Bishop of Carlisle, suggested in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; that the Church should construct a &quot;Church House&quot; as a memorial of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Accordingly, a charity called the Corporation of the Church House was founded by royal charter on 23 February 1888, with the aim of raising the necessary funds and executing the project.

A site was selected in Dean&#x27;s Yard, close to Westminster Abbey and Westminster School. In 1888, sufficient funds had been raised to purchase the freehold on a block of buildings occupying the south side of Dean&#x27;s Yard and bordered by Great Smith Street, Little Smith Street and Tufton Street. These buildings included the Westminster Free Library (which relocated to the other side of Great Smith Street) and a boarding house for pupils at Westminster School. The leases on 10 and 11 Dean&#x27;s Yard could be purchased outright and these became the offices of several other Anglican societies, and were inaugurated as the first Church House on 21 July 1888.

==Church House (1896)==
 In November 1889, Sir Arthur Blomfield was selected to design the new building which was intended to occupy the whole site; the south façade of his plans bore some resemblance to Hampton Court Palace. Meanwhile, difficulties with fund raising and obtaining the leases of buildings on the site caused a considerable delay. The first part of the project was the Great Hall on the south of the site, the foundation stone for which was laid on 24 June 1891 by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and was opened on 11 February 1896 by Prince George, Duke of York. From 1899 the Great Hall contained a fine 3-manual pipe-organ by the London firm of T. C. Lewis; the gift of the Hon. Richard Strutt.
Fund raising for the western block of the project was quickly under way; which was to include a library and a hall for meetings of the Convocation of Canterbury. This hall was to be named after Henry Hoare, who had been instrumental in the revival of the Convocation in 1852 (its first meeting since 1717). The hall was opened by Frederick Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 28 January 1902. The rest of Blomfield&#x27;s projected building was never completed.

==Church House (present)==
The current building, designed by Sir Herbert Baker, is a 1930s replacement of the original building. Its construction was authorised by an Act of Parliament. Though delayed at first by the depression of the early 1930s, the foundation stone was laid by Queen Mary on 26 June 1937, and the building was officially opened by King George VI on 10 June 1940. The Assembly Hall had a three-manual pipe-organ built by The John Compton Organ Company of London.

After the building&#x27;s &quot;Assembly Hall&quot; was directly hit during the Blitz and yet suffered little damage, apart from irreparably damging the pipe-organ, the building was requisitioned for use as a chamber for the House of Lords.

The first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly was held in Westminster Central Hall, on 10 January 1946. The Security Council met for the first time a week later, 17 January 1946, in Church House.

Today, the building is the headquarters of the Archbishops&#x27; Council, the Church Commissioners and all its boards and councils (since 2007), as well as of the Church of England Pensions Board and the National Society. It is the meeting-place of the General Synod of the Church of England each February (alternating with York in July) and for special and inaugural sessions, usually in November. Areas of the building are available on a private hire basis for conferences and events.

The Church House is also the meeting-place of the Annual Bond Solon Expert Witness Conference each November, which is the largest gathering of expert witnesses in the UK.

The building was made a Grade II listed building in 1988, and is currently used as a conference centre when the general synod is not in session.

In December 2020, the Church House hosted 2 boxing events organised by boxing promoter Frank Warren and headlined by Daniel Dubois v Joe Joyce and Anthony Yarde v Lyndon Arthur on the following weekend. There were no spectators due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

<doc id="550013" wikidata="Q2142654" url="?curid=550013" title="Soup kitchen">
<text>A soup kitchen, food kitchen, or meal center is a place where food is offered to hungry and homeless people, usually for no cost, or sometimes at a below-market price (such as coin donations). Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods, soup kitchens are often staffed by volunteer organizations, such as church or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a food bank for free or at a low price, because they are considered a charity, which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services.

Historically, the majority of soup kitchens served mostly soup (or stew), usually with some kind of bread. Modern establishments which refer to themselves as &quot;soup kitchens&quot; frequently serve a wider variety of foods, so social scientists sometimes discuss them together with similar hunger relief agencies that provide more varied hot meals, such as community kitchens and meal centers.

While societies have been using various methods to share food with hungry people for millennia, the first soup kitchens in the modern sense may have emerged in the late 18th century. By the late 19th century, they were located in several American and European cities. In the United States and elsewhere, they became more prominent in the 20th century, especially during the Great Depression. With the much-improved economic conditions that immediately followed World War II, soup kitchens became less common in countries with advanced economies.

In the 21st century, the use of soup kitchens has increased in both the United States and Europe, following lasting global increases in the price of food which began in late 2006. Demand for their services grew as the Great Recession and the economic and inflation crisis of the 2020s began to worsen economic conditions for those with lower incomes. In much of the UK and Europe, demand further increased after the introduction of austerity-based economic policies from 2010. According to Emma Middleton, a poverty caseworker in the UK, in 2017 the situation and need for emergency food aid in the UK had changed significantly over the previous 15 years, as the cost of living increased and the existing safety nets had disappeared, adding that &quot;In the first few years [of this work], food poverty was not an issue. The soup kitchens and churches could deal with it, and it was mainly homelessness. You never saw families like that. What we see now is a constant stream of food poverty.&quot;

==History==
The earliest occurrences of soup kitchens are difficult to identify. Throughout history, societies have invariably recognized a moral obligation to feed hungry people. The philosopher Simone Weil wrote that feeding the hungry when one has resources to do so is the most obvious obligation of all. She also said that as far back as Ancient Egypt, it was believed that people needed to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Soup has long been one of the most economical and simple ways to supply nutritious food to large numbers of people.

The Christian church had been providing food to hungry people since St Paul&#x27;s day, and since at least the early Middle Ages such nourishment was sometimes provided in the form of soup. From the 14th to the 19th centuries, Islamic soup kitchens, called Imarets, were built throughout the Ottoman Empire. Soup and bread were often the main food served, though sometimes also rice, meat, fruit and sweet puddings.

Social historian Karl Polanyi wrote that before markets became the world&#x27;s dominant form of economic organisation in the 19th century, most human societies would generally either starve all together or not at all; because communities would naturally share their food. As markets began to replace the older forms of resource allocation such as redistribution, reciprocity, and autarky, society&#x27;s overall level of food security would typically rise. But food insecurity could become worse for the poorest section of society, and the need arose for more formal methods for providing them with food.

===Emergence of the modern soup kitchen===
The earliest modern soup kitchens were established by the inventor Sir Benjamin Thompson, who was employed as an aide-de-camp to the Elector of Bavaria in the 1790s. Thompson was an American loyalist refugee from New England and an inventor who was ennobled by Bavaria as Count Rumford. The Count was a prominent advocate of hunger relief, writing pamphlets that were widely read across Europe.

Count Rumford&#x27;s message was especially well received in Great Britain, where he had previously held a senior government position for several years and was known as &quot;the Colonel&quot;. An urgent need had recently arisen in Britain for hunger relief, due to her leading role in driving the Industrial Revolution. While technological development and economic reforms were rapidly increasing overall prosperity, conditions for the poorest were often made worse, as traditional ways of life were disrupted. In the closing years of the 18th century, soup kitchens run on the principles pioneered by Rumford were to be found throughout England, Wales, and Scotland, with about 60,000 people being fed by them daily in London alone.

While soup kitchens were initially well regarded, they attracted criticism from some, for encouraging dependency, and sometimes on a local level for attracting vagrants to an area. In Britain, they were made illegal, along with other forms of aid apart from workhouses, by the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834.

During the Irish famine of the 19th century, in which one million people may have died, the British government passed the Temporary Relief Act (also known as the Soup Kitchen Act) in February 1847. The Act amended the restrictions on the provision of aid outside the workhouses for the duration of the famine and expressly allowed the establishment of soup kitchens in Ireland to relieve pressure from the overstretched Poor Law system, which was proving to be totally inadequate in coping with the disaster.

Prohibition against soup kitchens was soon relaxed on mainland Britain too, though they never again became as prevalent as they had been in the early 19th century, partly as from the 1850s onwards, economic conditions generally began to improve even for the poorest. For the first few decades after the return of soup kitchens to mainland Britain, they were at first heavily regulated, run by groups like the Charity Organization Society. Even in the early 20th century, campaigning journalists like Bart Kennedy would criticize them for their long queues, and for the degrading questions staff would ask hungry people before giving out any soup.

===Spread to the United States===

The concept of soup kitchens spread to the United States from Ireland after the Great Famine and the concomitant wave of Irish emigration to the New World. The earliest ones were established in the 1870s. A sharp rise in the number of hungry people resulting from an industrial recession coincided with the success of the AICP, and the American branch of the &quot;Charity Organization Society&quot;, in getting various forms of &quot;outdoor relief&quot; banned. This resulted in civil society establishing soup kitchens, to help feed those of the poor who did not wish to subject themselves to the regimented organisation of the Almshouses favored by the charitable societies.
It is believed the term &quot;breadline&quot; entered the popular lexicon in the 1880s. It was during those years that a noteworthy bakery in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, &quot;Fleischmann Model Viennese Bakery&quot;, instituted a policy of distributing unsold baked goods to the poor at the end of their business day. By the late 19th century soup kitchens were to be found in several US cities. The concept of soup kitchens hit the mainstream of United States consciousness during the Great Depression. One soup kitchen in Chicago was sponsored by American mobster Al Capone in an apparent effort to clean up his image.

With the improved economic conditions that followed the Second World War, there was less need for soup kitchens in advanced economies. However, with the scaling back of welfare provision in the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration, there was a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies such as soup kitchens. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks, about 80% of emergency kitchens, and all known food rescue organisations, were established in the US after Reagan took office in 1981. Presently, Catholic Charities USA of Colorado Springs, Colorado, founded by The Sisters of Loretto, provides food to 600–700 persons or more per day, and has been doing so since 1985.

==In the 21st century==
Use of soup kitchens has grown rapidly across the world, following the lasting global inflation in the cost of food that began in late 2006. The financial crisis of 2007–2008 further increased the demand for soup kitchens, as did the introduction of austerity policies that have become common in Europe since 2010. Modern soup kitchens are generally well regarded, though like their historical counterparts they are sometimes disliked by local residents for lowering the tone of a neighborhood.

===Iranian harem Imam Kitchen===
The &quot;harem kitchens&quot; that feed 10 thousand to 40 thousand daily average and partly through food product of Astan Quds. During Ramadan it dines one million pilgrim and citizens.

=== Sikh temple soup kitchens ===
Every Sikh Gurdwara has a religiously sanctioned moral and humanitarian obligation to serve and provide hospitality, provisions, nourishments and meals to any person, regardless of race, creed, gender, caste, religious profession, identification, or affiliation. At the Langar (the Gurdwara&#x27;s community run free kitchen), food is served to all visitors regardless of faith, religion, or background. Only lacto-vegetarian food is served and people eat together as equals. The institution of the Sikh langar was started by the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak. It was designed to uphold the principle of equality between all people regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender, or social status. In addition to the ideals of equality, the tradition of langar expresses the ethics of sharing, community, inclusiveness, and oneness of humankind.
The world&#x27;s largest and longest running soup kitchen is run at the Sikhs&#x27; holiest shrine, Harmandir Sahib in Punjab, India, which in 2013 was serving free food for up to 300,000 people every day. It was started in circa 1481 AD by Guru Nanak and has continued ever since, except for two brief breaks.

=== Comparison with front line food banks and pantries===

In some countries such as the United Kingdom, increased demand from hungry people has largely been met by food banks, operating on the &quot;front line&quot; model, where they give food out directly to hungry people. In the US, such establishments are called &quot;food pantries&quot;; Americans generally reserve the term &quot;food bank&quot; for entities which perform a warehouse-like function, distributing food to front line agencies, but not directly to hungry people themselves. Instead of providing hot meals, front line food banks and pantries hand out packages of groceries so that recipients can cook themselves several meals at home. This is often more convenient for the end user. They can receive food for up to a dozen or so meals at once, whereas with a soup kitchen, they typically only receive a single meal with each visit. 

Food banks typically have procedures needed to prevent unscrupulous people taking advantage of them, unlike soup kitchens which will usually give a meal to whoever turns up with no questions asked. The soup kitchen&#x27;s greater accessibility can make it more suitable for assisting people with long-term dependence on food aid. Soup kitchens can also provide warmth, companionship, and the shared communal experience of dining with others, which can be especially valued by people such as disabled, pensioners, widowers, homeless and ex-homeless. In some countries such as Greece, soup kitchens have become the most widely used form of food aid, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; reporting in 2012, that an estimated 400,000 Greeks were visiting a soup kitchen each day.

<text>Laurence Paul Cunningham (8 March 1956 – 15 July 1989) was an English professional footballer who played as a left winger. He notably played in England, France, and Spain, where he became the first-ever British player to sign for Real Madrid.

Cunningham had signed a schoolboy contract with Arsenal in 1970, but was released in 1972 as his style of play was deemed incompatible with the Gunners&#x27; &quot;give and go&quot; tactics. In 1974, he was picked up by second-tier side Leyton Orient where he remained for three years. But it was following his move to West Bromwich Albion in 1977 that his career really took off. There he played alongside Cyrille Regis and Brendon Batson under coach Ron Atkinson, becoming only the second trio of black players to be fielded in the top flight of English football. They became known as the &quot;Three Degrees&quot; – a term coined by Atkinson in reference to the American soul group of the same name. His form at the Hawthorns later earned a move to Real Madrid, where he remained for five years, winning La Liga once and the Copa del Rey twice. After a spell in France with Marseille, he returned to England with Leicester City in 1985, followed by another spell in Spain with Rayo Vallecano, and helped them secure Laliga promotion with his winning goal in the 86/87 season. Cunningham signed with Wimbledon in 1988, where, as a member of the &quot;Crazy Gang&quot;, he won the FA Cup in 1988 for the final trophy of his career.

Cunningham received his first international call-up to the England U21 side in 1977 while playing for West Bromwich Albion, becoming the first black footballer to represent an England international team organised by the Football Association. He later earned six caps for the full national team between 1979 and 1980, becoming one of the first-ever black England internationals.

While playing for Rayo Vallecano, Cunningham died in a brutal car accident in Madrid on the morning of 15 July 1989, at the age of 33.

==Early life ==
Born in Archway, London, he was the son of a former Jamaican race-horse jockey. Cunningham started in schoolboy football and was turned down by Arsenal before joining Leyton Orient in 1974.

== Club career ==
===West Bromwich Albion===
He joined West Bromwich Albion in 1977, where, under manager Johnny Giles, he teamed up with another black player, Cyrille Regis, and the following year under Ron Atkinson, with Brendon Batson. This was the second time an English top-flight team simultaneously fielded three black players (the first being Clyde Best, Clive Charles and Ade Coker for West Ham United against Tottenham Hotspur in April 1972) and Atkinson collectively referred to Cunningham, Batson and Regis as the &quot;Three Degrees&quot; after the U.S. soul singing trio.

Whilst a West Bromwich Albion player, he played in a benefit match for Len Cantello, that saw a team of white players play against a team of black players.

===Real Madrid===
In the summer of 1979, he made a historic move as the first British player to transfer to Real Madrid, who paid West Bromwich Albion a fee of £950,000. He scored twice on his debut and helped Madrid win the league and cup double.

Cunningham began the 1980–81 season with Madrid well and scored goals in the early rounds of the European Cup, but then succumbed to injury, and required an operation on a broken toe. He recovered just in time for the 1981 European Cup final against Liverpool in Paris, as Madrid lost 1–0. During pre-season training for the 1981–82 season, a thigh injury kept Cunningham out of the majority of the season (only three goalless appearances in the league), his only real noteworthy contribution was in the UEFA Cup quarter-final tie against Kaiserslautern. In the first leg, Cunningham scored a goal in Madrid&#x27;s 3–1 win. In the second leg, however, he was sent off shortly before halftime for retaliation, as Kaiserslautern won 5–0 to inflict Madrid&#x27;s worst-ever result in European competition. Cunningham won a second Copa del Rey medal as he played in the final, when Madrid beat Sporting Gijón 2–1, but it was a depressing campaign for him. For the next season, with Madrid signing Johnny Metgod to join Uli Stielike as the two permitted foreigners, Cunningham spent most of the 1982–83 season on the sidelines, until he reunited with Ron Atkinson at Manchester United on loan in April 1983. He left Madrid after the 1982–83 season, joining Gijón and subsequently Marseille.

===Later career===
Cunningham only remained in France for one season in 1984–85, before heading back to England to join Leicester City, although he played only half a season due to further injury. At the end of the 1985–86 season, Cunningham went back to Spain to play for Rayo Vallecano in the second tier. He moved to Charleroi in Belgium for the 1987–88 campaign, but was yet again struck down by injury, and in the new year was back in England on a short-term deal with Wimbledon, where he managed to help the &quot;Dons&quot; beat Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final.

Cunningham later moved back to Spain and Rayo Vallecano for the 1988–89 season. He scored the goal that secured their promotion to the Primera Division. Cunningham was killed in a car crash in Madrid on the morning of 15 July 1989, at the age of 33. He was survived by his wife and their son.

== International career ==
On 27 April 1977, Cunningham made his debut for the England under-21&#x27;s team in a friendly match against Scotland at Bramall Lane, scoring on his debut. At the time, he was considered the first black player to wear an England shirt at any level, but it was later revealed that Benjamin Odeje had played for the England Schoolboys team in 1971.

In 1979, he made his debut for the England national football team in a Home International match against Wales. Despite achieving the double with Real Madrid, Cunningham was overlooked by England manager Ron Greenwood for a place in the England squad for UEFA Euro 1980. He was called up by Greenwood for the 1982 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Norway, only to be an unused sub as England won 4–0. In the next qualifier against Romania, he came off the bench but was unable to help England avoid a 2–1 defeat. This proved to be his last England cap.

== Legacy ==
In November 2004, he was named as one of West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s 16 greatest players, in a poll organised as part of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations. The club announced that Cunningham would feature in a mural of the former players to be displayed at The Hawthorns.

In October 2013, the Nubian Jak Community Trust unveiled a blue plaque outside Brisbane Road. In September 2015, English Heritage erected a blue plaque on Cunningham&#x27;s childhood home at 73 Lancaster Road, Stroud Green, London.

In November 2017, a statue by Graham Ibbeson was unveiled in Coronation Gardens, Leyton, near Brisbane Road, paying tribute to Cunningham and his time at Leyton Orient. Another statue by Ibbeson was unveiled in West Bromwich town centre in May 2019. The work commemorates Cunningham&#x27;s time at Albion alongside black teammates Cyrille Regis and Brendon Batson, with a spokesperson for the organisers commenting that &quot;the three players opened the gates to allow black players into football at a time when they were locked out&quot;.

A play based on his life, &quot;Getting the Third Degree&quot; by Dougie Blaxland, was first performed in 2019.

<text>Talorgan son of Eanfrith (; died 657) was a King of the Picts from 653 to 657. As with his successors Gartnait son of Donuel and Drest son of Donuel, he reigned as a puppet king under the Northumbrian king Oswiu.

Talorgan was the son of Eanfrith of Bernicia, who had fled into exile among the Picts after his father, the Bernician king Æthelfrith, was killed around the year 616. Talorgan&#x27;s mother is likely to have been a member of a powerful Pictish royal dynasty, and may have been the sister of his predecessor Talorg son of Uuid, as &quot;Talorgan&quot; is a diminutive meaning &quot;Little Talorg&quot;. Talorgan may have claimed Pictish kingship through his mother, but his rule may also have been because he was the nephew of Oswiu at a time Oswiu was ruling Northumbria. Talorgan was probably imposed upon the southern Picts by Oswiu, as part of his policy of expansion and domination in northern Britain.

Talorgan became king in 653, probably with a powerbase within the southern Pictish territory south of the Mounth, which was also probably the home territory of his predecessor Talorg. In the next year, he defeated and killed Dúnchad mac Conaing, king of the Dál Riata, at the Battle of Strathyre. This may have been part of a traditional &quot;inaugural raid&quot; against hostile neighbours to mark the beginning of a king&#x27;s rule.

Talorgan&#x27;s death in 657 may have seen Oswiu launch an offensive against the Picts, as Bede implies that Oswiu&#x27;s subduing &quot;the greater part of the Picts&quot; took place in 658.

<doc id="550020" wikidata="Q1786876" url="?curid=550020" title="Michael Newdow">
<text>Michael Arthur Newdow (born June 24, 1953) is an American attorney and emergency medicine physician. He is best known for his efforts to have recitations of the current version of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools in the United States declared unconstitutional because of its inclusion of the phrase &quot;under God&quot;. He also filed and lost a lawsuit to stop the invocation prayer at President Bush&#x27;s second inauguration and in 2009 he filed a lawsuit to prevent references to God and religion from being part of President Obama&#x27;s inauguration.

Newdow is an atheist and an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church. In 1997, he started an organization called FACTS (First Atheist Church of True Science), which advocates strong separation of church and state in public institutions. He also serves on the Advisory Board of Secular Coalition for America.

==Early life and education==
Newdow grew up in the Bronx and in Teaneck, New Jersey, where his nominally Jewish family moved in 1960. He graduated from Teaneck High School.

After graduating from high school, Newdow attended Brown University, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology in 1974. He told &quot;Brown Alumni Magazine&quot; that he can&#x27;t remember ever believing in God, saying, &quot;I was born an atheist.&quot;

He then attended the UCLA School of Medicine, earning his M.D. in 1978. He has worked as an emergency room physician at numerous hospitals, and holds medical licenses in California and several other states.

Newdow attended the University of Michigan Law School, graduating with a J.D. in 1988. He subsequently passed the bar exam in Sacramento County, California (District 3) and was admitted to the State Bar of California on July 29, 2002; he is still an active member there, as of August, 2018.

==Litigation==
===Pledge of Allegiance===

Newdow is best known for the lawsuit which he states was filed on behalf of his daughter against inclusion of the words &quot;under God&quot; in public schools&#x27; recitals of the United States&#x27; Pledge of Allegiance. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that the phrase constitutes an endorsement of religion, and therefore violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, the decision was later overruled by the Supreme Court of the United States on procedural grounds, citing that Newdow did not have custody of his daughter and therefore did not have the right to bring suit on her behalf, nor did he meet the Court&#x27;s prudential standing requirements to bring the suit on behalf of himself.

Newdow filed suit again in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California regarding the same issue, but this time on behalf of three unnamed parents and their children. Citing the precedent set by the Supreme Court in the course of Newdow&#x27;s previous suit, Judge Lawrence K. Karlton ruled that Newdow did not have standing to bring his lawsuit, but the other plaintiffs did have standing. Based on the previous ruling by the Ninth Circuit, the judge ruled that the pledge is unconstitutional when recited in public schools.

On March 11, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the words &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance in the case of &quot;Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District&quot;. On page 60 of the ruling the court writes: &quot;We hold that the California Education Code - 52720 and the School District&#x27;s policy having teachers lead students in the recitation of the Pledge, and having those who do not wish to participate do so with impunity, do not violate the Establishment Clause. Therefore we reverse the decision of the district court holding that the School District&#x27;s policy is unconstitutional and vacate the permanent injunction prohibiting the recitation of the Pledge by willing students.&quot; The court also ruled against Newdow in that he had no prudential standing to file a complaint in the first place. Senior Circuit Judge Dorothy W. Nelson joined Judge Carlos T. Bea in the ruling, but Judge Stephen Reinhardt dissented.

===In God We Trust===
In November 2005, Newdow announced that he wanted to have &quot;In God We Trust&quot; removed from U.S. coins and banknotes. In a November 14, 2005 interview with Fox News&#x27;s Neil Cavuto, Newdow compared &quot;In God We Trust&quot; appearing on United States currency with racial segregation (specifically separate drinking fountains), saying, &quot;How can you not compare those? What is the difference there? Both of them [whites and blacks] got equal water. They both had access. It was government saying that it&#x27;s okay to separate out these two people on the basis of race. Here we&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s okay to separate two people on the basis of their religious beliefs.&quot;

In a 2006 interview on the day that the United States House of Representatives passed the Pledge Protection Act, Newdow told WERS-FM&#x27;s David Goodman, &quot;A few hours ago, the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States of America voted 260 to 167 to completely gut the U.S. Constitution of its separation of powers and violate numerous other clauses because they thought it was important enough to keep &#x27;under God&#x27; in the Pledge of Allegiance. I don&#x27;t think people would&#x27;ve done that for our political heritage or anything else. They did it because they want God in their government because it stands for a religious view that they adhere to, and they want to see that religious view espoused by government, which is exactly what the Establishment Clause forbids.&quot;

In June 2006, a federal judge rejected Newdow&#x27;s Establishment Clause lawsuit on the grounds that the minted words amount to a secular national slogan, and do not dictate anyone&#x27;s beliefs. Newdow stated that he would appeal the ruling, although &quot;Aronow v. United States&quot; was decided on the same grounds in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the lower court was required to return the same ruling, likewise the Ninth Circuit does not traditionally overrule previous Ninth Circuit rulings.

On December 4, 2007, Newdow argued before a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit to remove both &quot;under God&quot; from the Pledge of Allegiance (Roe v. Rio Linda Union School District), and &quot;In God We Trust&quot; from United States currency. The Ninth Circuit rejected Newdow&#x27;s challenge. In a decision published March 11, 2010, the court held that its earlier decision in &quot;Aronow&quot;, which &quot;held the national motto is of a &quot;patriotic or ceremonial character,&quot; has no &quot;theological or ritualistic impact,&quot; and does not constitute &quot;governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise,&quot; foreclosed Newdow&#x27;s argument. In an opinion concurring only in the judgment, even the extremely liberal Judge Stephen Reinhardt agreed that &quot;Aronow&quot; was controlling precedent.

Newdow also filed a lawsuit in federal court after Franklin Graham gave the invocation at George W. Bush&#x27;s 2001 inauguration. The lawsuit claimed that inaugural prayer was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion. It also was unsuccessful.

===California textbook case===
Newdow also represents California Parents for the Equalization of Educational Materials (CAPEEM), a group that has filed a lawsuit against the officials of California Department of Education and the California State Board of Education. The lawsuit challenges the teaching of biblical events as historical facts and was brought by CAPEEM, which was formed by Hindu parents in California. CAPEEM eventually settled the lawsuit for $175,000.

===Obama inauguration===

On December 31, 2008, Newdow and 17 other people, plus 10 groups representing atheists, sued Chief Justice John G. Roberts and others involved in the inauguration of Barack Obama in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking to prevent the Chief Justice from saying &quot;so help me God.&quot; The Constitution specifically defines only this single oath of office of 35 words and does not include these four words.

The Associated Press ran several reports including one picked up by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and many other affiliates that inaccurately stated that the suit was an attempt by atheists to prevent the President from saying &quot;so help me God.&quot; The suits specifically state that an injunction is not sought against the president, but rather only against the Chief Justice.

In addition, in other courts the demand was to end all religious prayer at the inauguration based on the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which he had sued to prevent in the two previous inaugurations unsuccessfully.

Judge Reggie Walton refused to grant Newdow&#x27;s motion for a preliminary injunction, saying that as a district court judge, he did not feel he had the authority to issue such an order against the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and that the inclusion of such words is an exercise of the incoming President&#x27;s right of free speech; although the president&#x27;s right to express his private prayer in words of his choosing was specifically not challenged in the lawsuit, Chief Justice Roberts was served with a demand notice. The outcome was that Mr. Obama did conclude with &quot;So Help Me God&quot; but the prompting was in the form of a query, indicating that this was his choice and not part of the constitutionally prescribed oath of office.

Newdow later reported that he would not challenge the denial of his preliminary injunction motion, but would appeal the case through the appellate court. In &quot;Newdow v. Roberts&quot;, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the case, holding that Newdow&#x27;s claims with respect to the 2009 inauguration were moot, and that he lacked standing to challenge the 2013 and 2017 inaugurations. In May 2011, the United States Supreme Court denied Newdow&#x27;s request to hear the case. Justice Roberts&#x27; response to Newdow&#x27;s petition was to prompt Obama&#x27;s &quot;So Help Me God&quot; with a question, &quot;So Help You God?&quot; to differentiate from the other 36 constitutional words.

==Awards==
In November 2002, Newdow was given the Freethinker of the Year award by the Freedom From Religion Foundation following the Pledge case. In 2004, he received the special Recognition Freethought Hero Award for his case to remove &quot;In God We Trust&quot; from currency. In May 2004, the American Humanist Association gave Newdow its Humanist Pioneer Award.

<text>The St. Bernard or Saint Bernard (, ) is a breed of very large working dog from the Western Alps in Italy and Switzerland. They were originally bred for rescue work by the hospice of the Great St Bernard Pass on the Italian-Swiss border. The hospice, built by and named after the Alpine monk Saint Bernard of Menthon, 
acquired its first dogs between 1660 and 1670. The breed has become famous through tales of Alpine rescues, as well as for its large size and gentle temperament.

==Description==
The St. Bernard is recognized internationally today as one of the molosser breeds. It is a giant dog. The coat is smooth being close and flat. The colour is primarily white with smaller or larger red patches with a clear to dark red mantle and reddish-brown mantle being the most &#x27;valuable&#x27;. A brindle reddish colour and brownish-yellow colour are both allowed but less desirable. The tail is long and heavy, hanging high. The eye colour ranges from light brown to dark brown and should have naturally tight lids, with haws only slightly visible.

==History of the St. Bernard==
The earliest written records of the St. Bernard are from monks at the Great St Bernard Hospice at the Great St Bernard Pass in 1707, with paintings and drawings of the dog dating even earlier. Early British accounts of the breed described the breed as the Alpine Spaniel. The first evidence that the dogs were in use at the monastery is in two paintings dating to 1690 by Italian artist Salvator Rosa. The most famous St. Bernard to save people at the pass was Barry (sometimes spelled Berry), who reportedly saved somewhere between 40 and 100 lives. There is a monument to Barry in the Cimetière des Chiens, and his body was preserved in the Natural History Museum in Bern.

Another famous dog was Rutor, the faithful companion of the Italian priest Pierre Chanoux, named after the peak Tête du Rutor located above the Little St. Bernard pass. The classic St. Bernard looked very different from the St. Bernard of today because of crossbreeding. Severe winters from 1816 to 1818 led to increased numbers of avalanches, killing many of the dogs used for breeding while they were performing rescues. In an attempt to preserve the breed, the remaining St. Bernards were crossed with Newfoundlands brought from the Colony of Newfoundland in the 1850s, as well as with other breeds. This led to a significant change in their appearance and abilities. The long fur they inherited would freeze in the snowy climate of the Alps, weighing them down and reducing their effectiveness as rescue dogs.

The dogs never received any special training from the monks. Instead, younger dogs would learn how to perform search and rescue operations from older dogs.

The Swiss St. Bernard Club was founded in Basel on 15 March 1884. The St. Bernard was the first breed entered into the Swiss Stud Book in 1884, and the breed standard was finally approved in 1888. Since then, the breed has been a Swiss national dog.

During World War I St. Bernard dogs assisted the Red Cross and were used to carry supplies to troops in the Italian mountains, stationed in places inaccessible to mules and horses.

The dogs at the Great St Bernard Hospice were working dogs that were smaller than today&#x27;s show St. Bernards. Originally about the size of a German Shepherd Dog, the St. Bernard grew to the size of today&#x27;s dog as kennel clubs and dog shows emphasized appearance over the dog&#x27;s working ability, along with a closed stud book.

=== Naming ===
The name &quot;St. Bernard&quot; originates from the Great St Bernard Hospice, a traveler&#x27;s hospice on the often treacherous Great St Bernard Pass in the Western Alps, between Switzerland and Italy. The pass, the lodge, and the dogs are named for Bernard of Menthon, the 11th century Italian monk who established the station.

&quot;St. Bernard&quot; was not in widespread use until the middle of the 19th century. The dogs were called &quot;Saint Dogs&quot;, &quot;Noble Steeds&quot;, or &quot;Barry Dogs&quot; before that time.

=== Related breeds ===
The breed is strikingly similar to the English Mastiff. The modern St. Bernard is radically different from the original dogs kept at the Great St Bernard Hospice, most notably by being much larger in size and build. Since the late 1800s, the St. Bernard breed has been ever refined, using many different large molosser-type breeds, including the Newfoundland, Great Pyrenees, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Great Dane, English Mastiff, and possibly the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Shepherd Dog. It is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after World War II, which may explain why all of them played a part in the creation of the St. Bernard as it is seen today.

The four Sennenhund (Swiss mountain dog) breeds, the Grosser Schweizer Sennenhund (Greater Swiss Mountain Dog), the Berner Sennenhund (Bernese Mountain Dog), the Appenzeller Sennenhund (Appenzeller Mountain Dog), and the Entlebucher Sennenhund (Entlebucher Mountain Dog), are similar in appearance to the St. Bernard and share the same location of origin and history, but are tricolour (black, tan and white) rather than red and white or mahogany brindle and white, as the St. Bernand is.

The Russian army kennels crossbred St. Bernards with Caucasian Shepherd Dogs to produce the Moscow Watchdogs that are still used as military service dogs in Russia today. St. Bernards have in common many characteristics of livestock guardian dog breeds.

=== Kennel Club recognition ===
The St. Bernard is recognised internationally by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as a Molosser in Group 2, Section 2. The breed is recognised by The Kennel Club (UK), the Canadian Kennel Club, and the American Kennel Club in the Working Dog group. The United Kennel Club in the United States places the breed in the Guardian Dog Group. The New Zealand Kennel Club and the Australian National Kennel Council place the breed in the Utility Group

==Modern activities – Great St Bernard Pass and Little St Bernard Pass==

St. Bernards are no longer used for Alpine rescues, the last recorded instance of which was in 1955. As late as 2004, the Great St Bernard Hospice still retained 18 of the dogs for reasons of tradition and sentiment.

An annual celebration of the breed takes place on the Little Saint Bernard Pass and at the town of Rosières-Montvalzan on the French side. St. Bernard enthusiasts and breeders gather for a dog show and parades.

==Health==

A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 9.3 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2005 Swedish study of insurance data found 74% of St Bernards died by the age of 10, higher than the overall rate of 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10.

Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) has been shown to be hereditary in the breed.

A study found a mutation in the gene ARHGEF10 to be highly associated with a juvenile-onset inherited polyneuropathy similar to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

The Saint Bernard is predisposed to several skin conditions, these include: acral lick dermatitis, intertrigo, dermal arteritis, hygroma, and pyotraumatic dermatitis.

An American study of veterinary records found the Saint Bernard to be predisposed to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), with 2.6% of dogs having the condition compared to 0.2% for mixed-breeds. A study in England found 20 out of 369 cases of DCM to be Saint Bernards with 72% of those all presenting for atrial fibrillation.

An American study reviewing over a million cases presented to 27 veterinary teaching hospitals in North America found the Saint Bernard to be the second most prediposed to canine hip dysplasia with 14.70% of dogs having the condition compared to 3.52% overall. The Saint Bernard was also found to be predisposed towards canine cruciate ligament deficiency (CCLD) with 3.57% of dogs having the condition compared to 2.55% overall. The Saint Bernard had the third highest prevalence for dogs with both conditions at 1.19% compared to the overall rate of 0.3%.

A review of 1,934 cases of gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV) found the Saint Bernard to be greatly predisposed to the condition with an odds-ratio of 4.2. A health survey in the UK found 4.6% of dogs to have the condition and 15.1% of dogs to have died from the condition. A study in California found 3.76% of dogs presented had GDV

== Temperament ==

Known as a classic example of a gentle giant, the Saint Bernard is calm, patient, and sweet with adults, and especially children. Overall, it is a gentle, loyal, and affectionate breed, and if socialized should be very friendly. While generally not instinctively protective, a St. Bernard may bark at strangers, and their size makes them good deterrents against possible intruders.

The St. Bernard was bred to be a working companion and to this day it lives to please its master, and is an amiable yet hard worker. St. Bernards have retained their natural ability for scent work and depending on the skill of the trainer and the talents of the dog, they can participate in tracking events or even become involved in search and rescue work.

==Notability==

=== In media ===

St. Bernards are often portrayed, especially in old live action comedies such as &quot;Swiss Miss&quot;, the TV series &quot;Topper&quot;, and classic cartoons (such as the 1938 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short &quot;Cracked Ice&quot;), wearing small barrels of brandy around their necks. Avalanche victims supposedly drank the brandy to stay warm while awaiting rescue, although this is medically unsound. The monks of the St. Bernard Hospice deny that any St. Bernard has ever carried casks or small barrels around their necks; they attribute the image to an 1820 painting by Edwin Landseer, &quot;Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller&quot; (which became a popular engraving in 1831 by Charles Landseer). The monks did keep casks around for photographs by tourists.

There was apparently at least one dog that really did carry brandy. In &quot;The Percy Anecdotes&quot;, by Thomas Byerley, published in 1823, the following anecdote appears, and was often quoted in other books in the 19th century:

The breed of dogs kept by the monks to assist them ... has been long celebrated for its sagacity and fidelity. All the oldest and most tried of them were lately buried, along with some unfortunate travellers, under a valanche [sic]; but three or four hopeful puppies were left at home in the convent, and still survive. The most celebrated of those who are no more, was a dog called Barry. This animal served the hospital for the space of twelve years, during which time he saved the lives of forty individuals. His zeal was indefatigable. Whenever the mountain was enveloped in fogs and snow, he set out in search of lost travellers. He was accustomed to run barking until he lost breath, and would frequently venture on the most perilous places. When he found his strength was insufficient to draw from the snow a traveller benumbed with cold, he would run back to the hospital in search of the monks….

When old age deprived him of strength, the Prior of the Convent pensioned him at Berney, by way of reward. After his death, his hide was stuffed and deposited in the museum of that town. The little phial, in which he carried a reviving liquor for the distressed travellers whom he found among the mountains, is still suspended from his neck.

A &quot;Punch&quot; magazine cartoon from 1949 depicts a man with a St. Bernard and several puppies, all of which are wearing neck casks. The man explains, &quot;Of course, I only breed them for the brandy.&quot;

A frequent joke in old MGM and Warner Brothers shorts is to depict the dogs as compulsive alcoholics who engage in frequent nips from their own casks.

<doc id="550033" wikidata="Q2948525" url="?curid=550033" title="Chamizal dispute">
<text>The Chamizal dispute was an international land and boundary conflict over contested land (estimates range from ) along the Mexico–United States border between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. The conflict was caused by multiple meandering, southward shifts in the Rio Grande, which delineates the U.S.-Mexico boundary in this region. When the International Boundary Commission (IBC) first began investigating the dispute in 1895, it discovered that an 1852 survey of the international boundary/Río Grande (in ) through El Paso and Cd. Juárez was significantly different from the river&#x27;s present (1895) location. 

After much investigation, the IBC decided that the Chamizal Dispute began in 1864. That year the Río Grande made a dramatic, southward shift after a remarkable flood in the river. This shift subsequently placed Mexican territory known at that time as Paso del Norte&#x27;s &quot;Partido Chamizal&quot; or the &quot;Chamizal District&quot; north of the river/boundary—and seemingly into U.S. jurisdiction. As the river’s southward meanderings continued, and as more Anglo American settlers began arriving to this region in the late 1880s and settling Partido Chamizal as part of the American town of El Paso, these processes together created the swath of contested land known as &quot;El Chamizal&quot; or the &quot;Chamizal Zone.&quot; While Americans exerted control and jurisdiction over the territory, the state of Mexico never relinquished its claim to the zone. Residents of Cd. Juárez who had owned and farmed land within Partido Chamizal also never gave up their claims.

Over the many decades that followed, multiple efforts on the part of both Americans and Mexicans were made to resolve this conflict. Each time, these efforts failed. Tensions over the territory during the historic Taft–Díaz summit almost resulted in the attempted assassination of both presidents on October 16, 1909. 

In 1961, in the midst of the Cold War and with worries over Mexico&#x27;s potential allyship with Cuba mounting, U.S. President John F. Kennedy broached the idea of perhaps finally setting this conflict. Negotiations coalesced, in 1963, with the Chamizal Treaty, which was ratified in 1964. The settlement identified 630-acres in South El Paso as El Chamizal and promised to return this acreage to Cd. Juárez. The Chamizal Zone was officially ceded to and became incorporated into the Republic of Mexico on October 28, 1967. The Chamizal Treaty brought about the first time the United States gave inhabited land back to Mexico. Other minor land exchanges occurred under the Banco Convention of 1905 and the Boundary Treaty of 1970, including Rio Rico in 1977.

The Spanish word &quot;Chamizal&quot; comes from &quot;chamizo&quot; or &quot;chamiza&quot;, the common name for the four-wing saltbush (&quot;Atriplex canescens&quot;) which covered the disputed land near the present-day park. It is a rather ordinary looking shrub that thrives in diverse soil and climatic conditions. The chamiza once grew prolifically in the Chamizal Zone because of the salty soil deposited by the river and the constant movement of this soil across the river’s alluvial plain. With roots reaching a depth of as much as 15 feet, the chamiza stabilized the soil and protected against eroding watersheds. With increased urbanization in both El Paso and Cd. Juárez through the 20th century, however, the once-prolific chamiza became increasingly scarce in the area.

==Origins (1848–1899)==
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (which officially ended the Mexican–American War) defined the international border as the line along the middle of the deepest channel in the Rio Grande, continuously in tandem with any fluctuation in its channels or its banks. In 1884, another treaty modified this by explicitly accepting the internationally established doctrine known as &quot;the law of accretion&quot; that specifies that the line of a river-defined border shall follow the changing path of the boundary river only in response to gradual alluvial deposition, but that sudden avulsion shall not affect the borderline.

The river continually shifted south between 1848 and the early 1900s, with the most radical shifts in the river occurring after floods in 1862, 1864, and 1865. By 1873 the river had moved approximately , cutting off land that was in effect made United States territory. The newly exposed land came to be known as &quot;El Chamizal&quot;, and eventually the land was settled and incorporated as part of El Paso. Both Mexico and the United States claimed the land. In 1895, Mexican citizens filed suit in the Juárez Primary Court of Claims to reclaim the land. The newly formed International Boundary Commission took up the case that same year, titling the case &quot;Chamizal case no.4.&quot;

In 1899, both countries dug a channel across the heel of the horseshoe bend of the river at the dispute site for flood control purposes. This moved a tract of land to the U.S. side of the river, but as man-made alterations do not change the boundary, this tract of land remained Mexican territory. This tract of land came to be known as Cordova Island, in a sense it was an island belonging to Mexico inside U.S. territory. Thus, there was little or no control by the local authorities, which created a haven for crime and opportunities for illegal crossings.

Estimates for El Chamizal total anywhere between 590 and 1600 acres; but, in truth, its exact size and location remains highly contested and is perhaps impossible to define due to limited and cursory documentation for the river’s meanderings. 

==Disputes and controversy (1899–1963)==
In 1909, Porfirio Díaz and William Howard Taft planned a summit in Ciudad Juárez and El Paso, a historic first meeting between a Mexican and a U.S. president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico. But tensions rose on both sides of the border over the Chamizal, which any route from El Paso to Ciudad Juárez would cross, even though it would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit. The Texas Rangers, 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, federal agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security. Frederick Russell Burnham, the celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250-person private security detail hired by John Hays Hammond, who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. Vice-Presidential candidate in 1908. On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R. Moore, a Texas Ranger, discovered a man holding a concealed palm pistol standing at the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route. Burnham and Moore captured, disarmed, and arrested the assassin within only a few feet of Díaz and Taft.

In 1910 Mexico and the United States agreed to have the dispute settled by the International Boundary and Water Commission, a body that had been created in 1889 to maintain the boundary (and which was subsequently expanded pursuant to subsequent treaties, in order to allocate river waters between the two nations, and provide for flood control and water sanitation). A tribunal was established comprising a representative from each country and a Canadian jurist, , as presiding officer to investigate and deliberate over whether the change in the river&#x27;s course had been gradual, whether the boundaries set by treaties were fixed, and whether the 1848 treaty applied. Mexico claimed that the boundary had never changed and therefore that the Chamizal was technically Mexican territory, while the United States claimed that the 1848 convention applied, that the boundary was the result of sudden erosion, and that the property therefore belonged to the United States.

The tribunal recommended that year that part of the disputed tract lying between the riverbed, as surveyed in 1852, and the middle of the river in 1864 would become United States territory and the remainder of the tract become part of Mexico. The United States rejected the proposal on grounds that it did not conform to the agreements of the arbitration – instead it fuelled an ongoing dispute between the two governments and fostered ill-will.

Between 1911 and 1963 various presidents made several more attempts to resolve the issue. Amongst the suggested compromises were forgiving debt, exchange of other territory along the Rio Grande, direct purchase of the tract, and inclusion of the Chamizal in the Rio Grande Rectification Project. The dispute continued to affect Mexico–United States relations adversely until President John F. Kennedy agreed to settle it on the basis of the 1911 arbitration award. It was hoped that settlement of the dispute would strengthen the Alliance for Progress and solidify the Organization of American States.

==Resolution==
The dispute was formally settled on January 14, 1964, when the United States and Mexico ratified a treaty that generally followed the 1911 arbitration recommendations. The agreement awarded to Mexico of the Chamizal area and east of the adjacent Cordova Island. Although no payments were made between the two governments, the United States received compensation from a private Mexican bank for 382 structures included in the transfer. The United States also received of Cordova Island from Mexico, and the two nations agreed to share equally in the cost of re-channeling the river. In 1964, Presidents Adolfo López Mateos and Lyndon B. Johnson met at the border to end the dispute. On September 17, 1963, the U.S. Congress introduced the American–Mexican Chamizal Convention Act of 1964, which finally settled the matter. In October 1967, President Johnson met with President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz on the border and formally proclaimed the settlement.

One of the aims of the Chamizal Convention was to build a man-made channel to prevent the Rio Grande from blurring the international boundary ever again. The channel was constructed of concrete, in width at the top and deep. The two governments shared the cost of the channel, along with the cost of three new bridges. 

In order to complete the terms of the Chamizal Treaty, more than 5,600 El Paso residents were also displaced from their homes within the 630-acres ceded to Mexico. Many of these residents were American citizens. The IBC and the U.S. federal government worked together to evict and relocate these residents from the 630-acres, which included five residential areas of South El Paso known as: Rio Linda, Cotton Mill, Cordova Gardens, El Jardin, and the last two southern blocks of Segundo Barrio. Although many residents organized to resist their displacement, they were unsuccessful in doing so. As part of the Chamizal Relocation Project, residents who owned their homes were given fair-market value. Tenants, however, were simply evicted. Years later, many of these displaced residents called their shared experience of displacement the &quot;Chamizal diaspora.&quot;

In 1974, the United States established a museum known as the Chamizal National Memorial to increase visitor awareness of cooperation, diplomacy and cultural values as a basic means to conflict resolution.

<text>David Cromwell (born 1962) is a British media campaigner and oceanographer. With David Edwards, he is a co-editor of the Media Lens website.

Cromwell was born in Glasgow. His mother was a practicing Catholic. He spent his formative years in Barrhead and, mostly, Cumbernauld and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in physics and astronomy. After completing a PhD in solar physics from the same university, which he was awarded in 1987, Cromwell moved to the United States in 1988 to pursue a year-long postdoctoral research at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.

Returning to Europe, Cromwell joined Shell International in 1989 as an exploration geophysicist. After five months of training in geology, geophysics, and management skills, Cromwell was posted to Shell&#x27;s exploration and production company in Assen, Netherlands, while living in nearby Groningen. He left Shell in 1993. At that time, he was appointed to a research post at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, United Kingdom, but left academia in 2010 to work full-time on Media Lens.

Founded in 2001 by Cromwell and David Edwards, Media Lens is a media analysis website which monitors the broadcast and the print media in the UK, attempting to show evidence of bias, distortions and omissions on such issues as climate change, Iraq and the &quot;war on terror&quot;. The founders of Media Lens draw on the &#x27;Propaganda Model&#x27; of media control advanced by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky. 

Journalist Oliver Kamm, leader writer for &quot;The Times&quot;, criticised Media Lens for comments on the Srebrenica massacre and Rwandan genocide, describing the group as a &quot;reliable conduit for denying genocide and whitewashing war crimes&quot;. In 2006, Kamm challenged Cromwell&#x27;s dependence on American historian Howard Zinn, and both men&#x27;s knowledge of source material relevant to America&#x27;s atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, asserting that this was &quot;a subject wholly outwith Cromwell&#x27;s competence&quot;. David Cromwell wrote a rebuttal of Kamm&#x27;s piece on the issue in January 2008. &quot;Not unusually, one has to go to media such as&quot; RT and Press TV &quot;to find any coverage&quot;, Cromwell wrote in September 2016 (about the Yemeni civil war), which are &quot;so often bitterly denigrated as &#x27;propaganda&#x27; operations by corporate journalists&quot;.

Cromwell has written a number of books with Edwards. The earliest of these, titled &quot;Guardians of Power: The Myth of the Liberal Media&quot;, was published by Pluto Press in 2006. The authors argue, with reference to examples from the press and broadcasting, that the mass media in Britain enable &#x27;state-corporate&#x27; power to pursue destructive aims at home and abroad. Their next book, &quot;Newspeak in the 21st Century&quot;, took a similar approach and appeared in 2009. &quot;Propaganda Blitz: How the Corporate Media Distort Reality&quot; was published by Pluto Press in 2018. In this book, the authors argue that &quot;major news media are an intrinsic component of this system run for the benefit of elites. The media are, in effect, the public relations wing of a planetary-wide network of exploitation, abuse and destruction&quot;. Reviewing &quot;Propaganda Blitz&quot; in the &quot;International Journal of Communication&quot;, Alan MacLeod of Glasgow University described Cromwell and Edwards as &quot;[t]wo of the most strident, long-standing and influential critics of the media&quot;.

As a solo author, Cromwell has written &quot;Private Planet&quot; (Charlbury: Jon Carpenter Publishing, 2001) and &quot;Why Are We the Good Guys?: Reclaiming Your Mind from the Delusions of Propaganda&quot;. In a review of the book, Ian Sinclair, writing for the &quot;Morning Star&quot;, described Cromwell as &quot;one of the most incisive and humane radical writers working today&quot;.

Together with historian Mark Levene, Cromwell founded the Crisis Forum, in 2002. According to Paul Robert Bartrop, Steven Leonard Jacobs, it is a &quot;consciousness-raising body that believes humankind is in serious trouble due to an economic and political system that is destroying its ability to sustain its existence.&quot; Cromwell and Levene edited a collection of essays, &quot;Surviving Climate Change: The Struggle to Avert Global Catastrophe&quot;, which was published by Pluto Press in, 2007.

<text>In surgery or medical procedure, a ligature consists of a piece of thread (suture) tied around an anatomical structure, usually a blood vessel, another hollow structure (e.g. urethra) or an accessory skin tag to shut it off.

==History==
The principle of ligation is attributed to Hippocrates and Galen. In ancient Rome, ligatures were used to treat hemorrhoids. Spanish Muslim doctor Al-Zahrawi described the procedure around the year 1000 in his book &quot;Kitab al-Tasrif&quot;. The concept of a ligature was reintroduced some 500 years later by Ambroise Paré and first performed by him in the village of Damvillers. It finally found its modern use in 1870–1880, made popular by Jules-Émile Péan.

==Procedure==
With a blood vessel the surgeon will clamp the vessel perpendicular to the axis of the artery or vein with a hemostat, then secure it by ligating it; i.e. using a piece of suture around it before dividing the structure and releasing the hemostat. It is different from a tourniquet in that the tourniquet will not be secured by knots and it can therefore be released/tightened at will.

Ligation is one of the remedies to treat skin tag, or acrochorda. It is done by tying string or dental floss around the acrochordon to cut off the blood circulation.
Home remedies include commercial ligation bands that can be placed around the base of skin tags.

Complications of ligation in polydactyly treatment include infection, neuroma or cyst formation.

<doc id="550055" wikidata="Q152698" url="?curid=550055" title="Reich Security Main Office">
<text>The Reich Security Main Office ( , RSHA) was an organization under Heinrich Himmler in his dual capacity as &quot;Chef der Deutschen Polizei&quot; (Chief of German Police) and , the head of the Nazi Party&#x27;s &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). The organization&#x27;s stated duty was to fight all &quot;enemies of the Reich&quot; inside and outside the borders of Nazi Germany. From its very inception, the RSHA was a central institution for the Nazis, playing a pivotal role in orchestrating and executing the Holocaust.

==Formation and development ==
Himmler established the RSHA on 27 September 1939. His assumption of control over all security and police forces in Germany was a significant factor in the growth in power of the Nazi state. With the formation of the RSHA, Himmler combined under one roof the Nazi Party&#x27;s &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD; SS intelligence service) and the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo; &quot;Security Police&quot;), which was nominally under the Interior Ministry. The SiPo was composed of two sub-departments, the &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot; (Gestapo; &quot;Secret State Police&quot;) and the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; (Kripo; &quot;Criminal Police&quot;). In correspondence, the RSHA was often abbreviated to &quot;RSi-H&quot; to avoid confusion with the &quot;SS-Rasse- und Siedlungshauptamt&quot; (RuSHA; &quot;SS Race and Settlement Office&quot;). The organization&#x27;s main goal was to protect Nazi Germany against enemies &quot;inside&quot; the country but later became instrumental (by design) in dealing with any opposition in occupied territories. 

The creation of the RSHA represented the formalization, at the highest level, of the relationship under which the SD served as the intelligence agency for the security police. A similar coordination existed in the local offices, where the Gestapo, criminal police, and SD were formally separate offices. This coordination was carried out by inspectors on the staff of the local higher SS and police leaders. One of the principal functions of the local SD units was to serve as the intelligence agency for the local Gestapo units. In the occupied territories, the formal relationship between local units of the Gestapo, criminal police, and SD was slightly closer.

The RSHA continued to grow at an enormous rate during World War II in Europe. Routine reorganization of the RSHA did not change the tendency for centralization within Nazi Germany, nor did it change the general trend for its members to develop direct relationships to Adolf Hitler, adhering to Nazi Germany&#x27;s typical pattern of the leader-follower construct. For the RSHA, centrality within Nazi Germany was pronounced since the organization completed the integration of government and Nazi Party offices as to intelligence gathering and security. Departments like the SD and Gestapo (within the RSHA) were controlled directly by Himmler and his immediate subordinate SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; and General of Police Reinhard Heydrich; the two held the power of life and death for nearly every German and were essentially above the law.
Heydrich remained the RSHA chief until his assassination in 1942. In January 1943 Himmler delegated the office to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; and General of Police Ernst Kaltenbrunner, who headed the RSHA until the end of the war in Europe. The head of the RSHA was also known as the CSSD or Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD (Chief of the Security Police and of the Security Service).

==Organization==
The RSHA &quot;became a typical overblown bureaucracy&quot;, wrote British author Gerald Reitlinger. &quot;The complexity of RSHA was unequalled... with at least a hundred... sub-sub-sections, a modest camouflage of the fact that it handled the progressive extermination which Hitler planned for the ten million Jews of Europe&quot;.

===Structure===
The organization at its simplest was divided into seven offices (&quot;Ämter&quot;):

* Amt I, &quot;Administration and Legal&quot;, originally headed by SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Dr. Werner Best. In 1940, he was succeeded by SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Bruno Streckenbach. In April 1944, Erich Ehrlinger took over as department chief.
* Amt II, &quot;Ideological Investigation&quot;, headed by SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Professor Franz Six.
* Amt III, &quot;Spheres of German Life&quot; or the &quot;Inland-SD&quot;, headed by SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Otto Ohlendorf, was the SS information gathering service for inside Germany. It also dealt with ethnic Germans outside of Germany&#x27;s prewar borders, and matters of culture.
* Amt IV, &quot;Suppression of Opposition&quot;. This was the &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot;, better known by the sobriquet Gestapo. It was headed by SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Heinrich Müller. SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Adolf Eichmann, one of the main architects of the Holocaust, was head of the Amt IV sub-department called &quot;Referat IV B4&quot;.
* Amt V, &quot;Suppression of Crime&quot; &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; (Kripo), originally led by SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Arthur Nebe and later by SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Friedrich Panzinger. This was the Criminal Police, which dealt with serious non-political crimes, such as rape, murder, and arson. Amt V was also known as the &quot;Reichskriminalpolizeiamt&quot; (Reich Criminal Police Department or RKPA).
* Amt VI, &quot;Foreign Intelligence Service&quot; or &quot;Ausland-SD&quot;, originally led by SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Heinz Jost and later by SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Walter Schellenberg.
* Amt VII, &quot;Ideological Research and Evaluation&quot; was a reconstitution of Amt II overseen by SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Professor Dr. Franz Six. Later it was headed by SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Paul Dittel. It was responsible for the creation of anti-semitic, anti-masonic propaganda, the sounding of public opinion, and monitoring of Nazi indoctrination by the public.

===Leadership===


====Timeline====
==Role in the Holocaust==
RSHA-controlled activities included gathering intelligence, criminal investigation, overseeing foreigners, monitoring public opinion, and Nazi indoctrination. The RSHA was also &quot;the central office for the extra-judicial NS (National Socialist) measures of terror and repression from the beginning of the war until 1945&quot;. The list of persecuted people included Jews, Communists, Freemasons, pacifists, and Christian activists. In addition to dealing with identified enemies, the RSHA advocated expansionist policies for the Reich and the Germanization of additional territory through settlement. &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot; (General Plan East), which was the secret Nazi plan to colonize Central and Eastern Europe exclusively with Germans, displacing inhabitants in the process through genocide and ethnic cleansing in order to obtain sufficient &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, stemmed from officials in the RSHA, among other Nazi organizations.

In its role as the national and Nazi security service, the RSHA coordinated activities among various agencies with wide-ranging responsibilities within the Reich. According to German historian, Klaus Hildebrand, the RSHA was &quot;particularly concerned with racial matters&quot;. Adolf Eichmann stated in 1937 that &quot;the anger of the people expressed in riots [was] the most effective means to rob the Jews of a sense of security&quot;. Entry into the Second World War afforded the RSHA the power to act as an intermediary in conquered or occupied territories, which according to Hans Mommsen, lent itself to implementing the extermination of Jewish populations in those places. An order issued by the RSHA on 20 May 1941 to block emigration of any and all Jews attempting to leave Belgium or France as part of the &quot;imminent Final Solution of the Jewish question&quot; demonstrates its complicity for the systematic extermination of Jews. By November of 1941, the RSHA had delivered three gas vans to the Chełmno extermination camp and within a month (8 December 1941) the Nazi&#x27;s mass murder campaign using gas began.

Part of the RSHA&#x27;s efforts to encourage occupied nations to hand over their Jews included coercing them by assigning Jewish advisory officials. Working with Eichmann&#x27;s Reich Association of Jews in Germany, they also deliberately deceived Jews still living in Germany and other countries by promising them good living quarters, medical care, and food in Theresienstadt (a camp which was a way station to facilities like Auschwitz) if they turned over their assets to the RSHA through a fictitious home-purchase plan. Systematic mass deportations of Jews to Auschwitz thus began in late March 1942 and were supervised by Eichmann, whose RSHA office was responsible for Jewish affairs and evacuations, the very man Heydrich called his &quot;expert&quot; concerning the transportation of Jews to occupied Poland. These transports to Auschwitz came from all over occupied Europe but started with Jews from Slovakia and France. 

It was to the leaders of the RSHA specifically—comprised by the top brass of the SS (most prominently Heydrich at first)—that reports about the murders and/or evacuation of Jews were sent. In January 1942, Heydrich sent SS Colonel Emanuel Schäfer to Serbia, who later (June 1942) &quot;reported with pride&quot; to the RSHA how Serbia was &quot;now free of Jews&quot; after having overseen the murder of some 17,000 persons. From March 1942 through November 1943, the horrific endeavor Operation Reinhard commenced under the RSHA&#x27;s oversight, whereby they established extermination camps at Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka, which resulted in the systematic murder of approximately 1.7 million Jews. 

===Wannsee Conference===
The Wannsee Conference, held on January 20, 1942, in a villa in Berlin&#x27;s affluent suburb of Wannsee, was a pivotal meeting in the Nazi regime’s bureaucratic machinery of genocide. Convened by RSHA chief, Reinhard Heydrich, the meeting brought together fifteen high-ranking Nazi officials from various government ministries, including the Gestapo, SS, and the civil administration. Among the key topics of discussion was the fate of &quot;Mischlinge&quot; (people of mixed Jewish and non-Jewish descent) and Jews in mixed marriages. Some officials proposed sterilization, while others argued for direct deportation. The meeting lasted approximately 90 minutes, during which mass murder was spoken of in purely administrative terms, reflecting the dehumanizing efficiency of Nazi policy. Contrary to some misconceptions, the purpose of the conference was not to decide whether to exterminate Europe’s Jewish population—that decision had already been made—but to formalize the logistical and administrative details necessary to carry out the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish question.&quot; 

In callous and detached language, Heydrich outlined plans to deport 11 million Jews from both occupied and neutral European countries to the East, where they would be subjected to forced labor under conditions designed to ensure mass death. Those who survived this process would be &quot;treated accordingly,&quot; a euphemism for outright extermination in killing centers such as Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec, and Sobibor. The Wannsee Protocol, the official record of the meeting according to the RSHA, later became crucial evidence in post-war trials, exposing the role of Nazi bureaucrats in the Holocaust. Historians avow that the conference remains a chilling example of how genocide can be facilitated not just by ideological fervor, but also through cold, technocratic planning by educated officials operating within a modern state apparatus.

===Oversight of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;===
The RSHA also oversaw the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, death squads that were formed under the direction of Heydrich and operated by the SS. Originally part of the SiPo, in September 1939 the operational control of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; was taken over by the RSHA. When the units were re-formed prior to the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the men of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were recruited from the SD, Gestapo, Kripo, Orpo, and Waffen-SS. The units followed the invasion forces of the German Army into Eastern Europe. Not infrequently, commanders of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; and &quot;Einsatzkommando&quot; sub-units were also desk officers from the main office of the RSHA. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, related agencies, and foreign auxiliary troops co-opted by the Nazis, killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews.

==Rosenstrasse protest and RSHA involvement==


As early as 1941, Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels began to complain that large numbers of Jews had not been transported out of Germany because of their work in the armaments industry. They were protected from deportation as they were considered to be irreplaceable labourers, and many were also married to Aryan Germans. These Jews believed that these factors ensured their safety. But by late 1942, Hitler and the RSHA were ready to rid Berlin of its remaining German Jews. In September 1942, Hitler decided that these labourers would still be protected, but that they were to be sent out of the country. Meanwhile, Auschwitz administrators were lobbying the government to send them more armaments workers, as they had struck a bargain with the arms producer IG Farben to construct a camp specifically for arms development using slave labour. As a result, the RSHA decreed the &quot;Fabrik-Aktion&quot;, an initiative to register all Jews working in armaments production. The primary targets of this action were Jews who were married to Aryans.

The RSHA planned to remove all German Jews from Berlin in early 1943 (the deadline to deport these Jews was 28 February 1943, according to a diary entry Goebbels wrote in early February). On 27 February 1943, the RSHA sent plainclothes Gestapo officials to arrest intermarried Jews and charge them with various crimes. Around 2,000 intermarried Jewish men were taken to Rosenstrasse 2–4, where they were held. Goebbels complained that many of the arrests had been &quot;thwarted&quot; by industrialists since some 4,000 Jews were expected to be detained. Angry wives—as &quot;Women of German blood&quot;—began protesting against this action in front of the building on Rosenstrasse where the men were being held. On 6 March, all but 25 of the intermarried Jews were released; the 25 still held were sent to Auschwitz. On 8 March, RSHA head Ernst Kaltenbrunner told Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick that the deportations had been limited to Jews who were not intermarried.

<doc id="550058" wikidata="Q4824396" url="?curid=550058" title="National Living Treasure (Australia)">
<text>National Living Treasure is a status created and occasionally updated by the National Trust of Australia&#x27;s New South Wales branch, awarded to up to 100 living people. Recipients were selected by popular vote for having made outstanding contributions to Australian society in any field of human endeavour. 

== History ==
In 1997, the National Trust of Australia (NSW) called for nominations from the public for 100 Australian Living Treasures, and each nomination was counted as one vote. The nominees had to be living and had to have made a substantial and enduring contribution. The choice of those who were named as National Living Treasures was made by more than 10,000 Australians voting. Their votes determined who was chosen. The first list of 100 Living Treasures was published in 1997. Phillip Adams, himself named as a National Treasure, gave his own opinion in an article on ANZAC Day in 2015 that when the list was first published in 1997, most were amused to find they were nominated; he suggested an alternative list to &quot;celebrate those who make us happy&quot;. 

In 2004, the list was refreshed with 15 new names, following the deaths of some people on the list and the exclusion of former Justice Marcus Einfeld who was imprisoned after his retirement for perjury and perverting the course of justice relative to a speeding ticket, following an identical process to that used in 1997 – a public nomination and vote.

On 23 January 2012, the National Trust of Australia (NSW) joined with &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; magazine to launch a nationwide search for seven new National Living Treasures. They were announced, amid controversy, on 4 March 2012, when the National Trust refused to endorse the NSW branch&#x27;s listing of the mining magnate Clive Palmer as one of the members. Graeme Blackman, the chairman of the Australian Council of National Trusts, said that &quot;I am telling you, as the chairman, it is not auspiced by the National Trust nationally.&quot; However, the next day it was reported that &quot;trust president Ian Carroll said the titles recognised that the country&#x27;s culture was more than just our buildings and natural heritage.&quot; It was later revealed that the vote for Palmer had been manipulated, with several internal emails having been sent to his company&#x27;s staff, their family and friends, urging that they vote for &quot;Professor Clive Palmer&quot;.

On 30 July 2014, the board of the National Trust of Australia (NSW) voted to remove Rolf Harris from the list after his conviction on 12 charges of indecent assault between 1969 and 1986 and to also withdraw the award. Harris had been among the original 100 Australians selected for the honour in 1997.

<doc id="550063" wikidata="Q3198003" url="?curid=550063" title="Knight Ridder">
<text>Knight Ridder was an American media company, specializing in newspaper and Internet publishing. Until it was bought by McClatchy on June 27, 2006, it was the second largest newspaper publisher in the United States, with 32 daily newspaper brands sold. Its headquarters were located in San Jose, California.

==History==
===Origins===
The corporate ancestors of Knight Ridder were Knight Newspapers, Inc. and Ridder Publications, Inc. The first company was founded by John S. Knight upon inheriting control of the &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; from his father, Charles Landon Knight, in 1933; the second company was founded by Herman Ridder when he acquired the , a German language newspaper, in 1892. As anti-German sentiment increased in the interwar period, Ridder successfully transitioned into English language publishing by acquiring &quot;The Journal of Commerce&quot; in 1926.

Both companies went public in 1969 and merged on July 11, 1974. For a brief time, the combined company was the largest newspaper publisher in the United States.

===At its peak===
Knight Ridder had a long history of innovation in technology. It was the first newspaper publisher to experiment with videotex when it launched its Viewtron system in 1983. After investing six years of research and $50 million into the service, Knight Ridder shut down Viewtron in 1986 when the service&#x27;s interactivity features proved more popular than news delivery.

Knight-Ridder purchased Dialog Information Services Inc. from Lockheed Corporation in August 1988. In October 1988, the company placed its eight broadcast television stations up for sale to reduce debt and to pay for the purchase of Dialog.

In 1997, when Tony Ridder was CEO, it bought four newspapers from The Walt Disney Company formerly owned by Capital Cities Communications, after Disney&#x27;s purchase of Cap Cities mainly for the ABC television network (The &quot;Kansas City Star&quot;, &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot;, &quot;Belleville News-Democrat&quot; and &quot;(Wilkes-Barre) Times Leader&quot; for $1.65 billion. It was, at the time, the most expensive newspaper acquisition in history.

For most of its existence, the company was based in Miami, with headquarters on the top floor of the Miami Herald building. In 1998, Knight Ridder relocated its headquarters from Miami to San Jose, Calif.; there, that city&#x27;s &quot;Mercury News&quot;—the first daily newspaper to regularly publish its full content online—was booming along with the rest of Silicon Valley. The internet division had been established there three years earlier. The company rented several floors in a downtown high-rise as its new corporate base.

In November 2005, the company announced plans for &quot;strategic initiatives,&quot; which involved the possible sale of the company. This came after three major institutional shareholders publicly urged management to put the company up for sale. At the time, the company had a higher profit margin than many Fortune 500 companies, including ExxonMobil.

In the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Knight Ridder DC Bureau reporters Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel wrote a series of articles critical of purported intelligence suggesting links between Saddam Hussein, the obtainment of weapons of mass destruction, and Al-Qaeda, citing anonymous sources.

Landay and Strobel&#x27;s stories ran counter to reports by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and other national publications, resulting in some newspapers within the Knight-Ridder chain refusing to run the two reporters&#x27; stories. After the war and the discrediting of many initial news reports written and carried by others, Strobel and Landay received the Raymond Clapper Memorial Award from the Senate Press Gallery on February 5, 2004, for their coverage.

The &quot;Huffington Post&quot; headlined the two as &quot;the reporting team that got Iraq right&quot;. The &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; described the reporting as &quot;unequaled by the Bigfoots working at higher-visibility outlets such as the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&quot;.

Later after the war, their work was featured in Bill Moyers&#x27; PBS documentary &quot;Buying The War&quot; and was dramatized in the 2017 film &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;.

===Purchase by McClatchy===
On March 13, 2006, The McClatchy Company announced its agreement to purchase Knight Ridder for a purchase price of $6.5 billion in cash, stock and debt. The deal gave McClatchy 32 daily newspapers in 29 markets, with a total circulation of 3.3 million. However, for various reasons, McClatchy decided immediately to resell twelve of these papers.

On April 26, 2006, McClatchy announced it was selling the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot;, &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot;, &quot;Monterey Herald&quot;, and &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; to MediaNews Group (with backing from the Hearst Corporation) for $1 billion.

==Knight Ridder-owned television stations==
Knight Newspapers entered broadcasting in 1946 via the purchase of minority ownership stakes in WQAM in Miami, WIND in Chicago, and WAKR in Akron; all three stations were in markets served by a Knight newspaper. The minority stake in WAKR&#x27;s parent company, Summit Radio, also included the establishment of WAKR-TV (channel 49), as well as WAKR-FM (97.5) and six radio stations purchased in Dayton, Ohio, Dallas, Texas, and Denver, Colorado. WAKR-TV was built and signed on by Summit on July 23, 1953, as the Akron market&#x27;s ABC affiliate, moving to channel 23 on December 1, 1967. Knight Ridder divested its stake in Summit Radio by 1977; a planned merger between the two entities in 1968 failed to be consummated.

In 1954, Ridder Newspapers launched WDSM-TV in Superior, Wisconsin, serving the Duluth, Minnesota market. Initially a CBS affiliate, it switched to its present NBC affiliation a year and a half after the station&#x27;s launch. It was spun off after Ridder&#x27;s merger with Knight Newspapers, Inc.

From 1956 to 1962, Knight and the Cox publishing family jointly operated Biscayne Television, which owned NBC affiliate WCKT in Miami, Florida, as well as WCKR radio, which this entity purchased from Cox; Knight sold off WQAM to a third party as part of Biscayne&#x27;s formation. Revelations of improper behavior and underhanded tactics by Biscayne and National Airlines (which signed on WPST-TV, also in Miami) to secure their licenses, along with ethics violations within the FCC itself, resulted in the licenses for both stations being revoked. A replacement license for WCKT was granted in 1960 to Sunbeam Television, the lone bidder for the prior license not to have engaged in any unethical behavior; Biscayne sold to Sunbeam WCKT&#x27;s non-license assets: the studios, intellectual property and all off- and on-air personnel for the new station, which took the WCKT name for continuity. Cox repurchased WCKR, reviving that station&#x27;s prior WIOD call sign.

Following the divestment of their stake in Summit Radio, Knight Ridder acquired Poole Broadcasting, which consisted of WJRT-TV in Flint, Michigan, WTEN in Albany, New York and its satellite WCDC in Adams, Massachusetts, and WPRI-TV in Providence, Rhode Island. Immediately after the acquisition of these stations was finalized, Knight Ridder cut a corporate affiliation deal with ABC, switching then-CBS affiliates WTEN/WCDC and WPRI (the latter of which eventually rejoined CBS) to ABC (WJRT was already affiliated with ABC when the affiliation deal was made). As part of the deal, Poole Broadcasting would eventually become Knight Ridder Broadcasting. Knight Ridder would acquire several television stations in medium-sized markets during the 1980s, including three stations owned by &quot;The Detroit News&quot; which the Gannett Company—which purchased the newspaper in 1986—could not keep due to Federal Communications Commission regulations on media cross-ownership and/or television duopolies then in effect. (None of Knight Ridder&#x27;s later acquisitions changed their network affiliations under Knight Ridder ownership; for example, then-NBC affiliate WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama remained an NBC affiliate when it was owned by Knight Ridder and would switch to Fox several years after Knight Ridder sold the station.)

In early 1989, Knight Ridder announced its exit from broadcasting, selling all of its stations to separate buyers; the sales were finalized in the summer and early fall of that year. This deal was made in order to reduce their debt loads from the proceedings. One of the stations, WALA-TV went to Burnham Broadcasting for $40 million, while WKRN would go to Young Broadcasting for $50 million, KOLD-TV to News-Press &amp; Gazette Company for an undisclosed price, and two television stations WPRI and WTKR to Narragansett Television L.P. for $150 million on February 18, 1989. This was followed by the following month with the sale of KTVY-TV to WHO-TV owner Palmer Communications, for $50 million. WTEN was the next-to-last station to be sold, going to Young Broadcasting for $38 million, and WJRT would eventually becoming the final Knight Ridder station, to be sold to SJL Broadcasting for $39 million.

<text>The black neon tetra (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) is a freshwater fish of the characin family (Characidae) of the order Characiformes. It is native to the Paraguay basin of southern Brazil. They are often found in the aquarium trade, and a feral population has been established in the rio Paraíba do Sul basin due to the trade.

==Taxonomy==
The species is named in honor of pet-book publisher Herbert R. Axelrod (1927–2017), whose Tropical Fish Hobbyist magazine published this description and several others by Géry.

==Description==

This species is of typical elongated tetra appearance; it is of plain basic coloration, but with two distinct, adjacent, longitudinal stripes; white above black. The eye has two thin but distinctive color bands across the top; red
above yellow. It grows to a maximum overall length of approximately . Befitting its common name, it slightly resembles the neon tetra, which belongs to a different genus (&quot;Paracheirodon&quot;). Females are often larger than males.

Additionally, the variety named Diamond or Brilliant does not have a white stripe but instead displays more reflective scales around the head.

The fish&#x27;s natural diet consists of small invertebrates and plants.

&quot;H. herbertaxelrodi&quot; is commonly kept as an aquarium fish by hobbyists.

The black neon tetra is sometimes called the black tetra, but that name more properly refers to a different species, &quot;Gymnocorymbus ternetzi.&quot;

== In the wild ==
Black Neon Tetras are egg-scattering free spawners, and they show no parental care for fry. The black and white stripes on their sides are used to keep the shoal in contact with each other in turbid water.

As Black Neon Tetras are so widely bred, they are no longer collected from the wild for trading.

Present in both forest streams and seasonal floodwaters, the Black Neon Tetra is an adaptable species. It prefers acidic habitats with running water and waterlogged debris as well as aquatic plants.

==In the aquarium==
Black neon tetras are kept in soft acidic water, although captive-bread they can often survive in mature tap water with a range of 5.5 - 7.5. Aquarists recommend that the water be kept clean at all times; that the tank contain live plants, a darker substrate and open water for swimming; and that the fish be kept in groups of at least 6, preferably more. The recommended minimum aquarium volume for a group of 6 is about 15 US gallons (60 L), and for a group of 8–10 fish, about 20 gallons.

Because black neon tetras swim at the top level of the aquarium, and do not feed from the bottom of the tank, aquarists keep them with bottom dwelling fish (such as pygmy corydoras) so that leftover food is then eaten up off the substrate and not left to waste.

Black neon tetras are fed a variety of foods, including flake, frozen and freeze dried food, living healthiest on a balanced mix. Small live foods like worms and brine shrimp are said to bring out the fish&#x27;s colors.

Contrary to other Tetras, Black Neon Tetras tend to shoal discreetly in aquaria.

===Breeding===
Black neon tetras can be spawned rather easily if the water quality is right. Before attempting to breed the black neon tetra, breeders condition the prospective parents with live food. Fish around one year old can be suitable for breeding. The sex of the fish is determined by its body shape, the female being much rounder and more plump than the males.
Although the black neon tetra can be kept in water harder and more alkaline than its natural habitat, for breeding it is necessary to be closer to what it would feel like in the Amazon. Breeding the Black neon tetra requires acidic water with no more than four degrees of hardness.

The black neon tetra is an egg scatterer, laying adhesive (sticky) eggs over plants, etc. One female can produce several hundred eggs. The parents eat their own eggs, so the parents are normally removed after spawning. As with many fish, the black neon tetra often spawns in the early morning.
Raising the fry can be more difficult because of their small size. The first food will normally be protozoa (infusoria), then &quot;Daphnia&quot;. Usually very fine fry food is used, graduating to slightly coarse fry food. At all ages, the black neon tetra benefits from suitably sized live food.

===Credit card fraud===
Mutekimaru, a video game live-streaming channel uses motion tracking software to detect the movement of black neon tetras. This movement is coded as inputs into video games, effectively allowing the fish to play video games on livestream, and in 2020 the black neon tetras were able to beat a game after a 3200 hours of play. 
In 2023, the fish had been playing a Pokemon game and had won several battles, however after five hours the game crashed, which gave the fish access to his main page. Because of the way the movement of the fish was intended to realate to computer imputs, the fish were able to access the Nintendo store and buy $3.85 USD worth of funds and also exposed the channel&#x27;s credit card details to the public.
